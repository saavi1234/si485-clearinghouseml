This lawsuit seeks to protect the rights of female student-athletes who have been\n24 deprived of equal educational opportunities and athletic participation by the California Department \n25 of Education (“CDE”), the California Interscholastic Federation (“CIF”), and Jurupa Unified School \n26 District (“District” or “JUSD”). \n27\n28\n1\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 2 of 51   Page ID #:2\n1 2. Plaintiffs are three current and former female athletes at Jurupa Valley High School\n2 (“JVHS”). Defendants have knowingly permitted a male1 student to compete on the JVHS varsity\n3 girls’ track and field and volleyball teams, access female locker rooms and bathrooms, and engage \n4 in harassing conduct toward female athletes.\n5 3. As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered sex discrimination, \n6 including sexual harassment, unsafe and unfair athletic environments, viewpoint discrimination, and \n7 infringements on their religious liberty and safety. These actions have deprived them of equal \n8 opportunities and their civil rights guaranteed by Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause of the \n9 Fourteenth Amendment, and the First Amendment.\n10 4. When Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. most recently informed their coach that they were \n11 uncomfortable sharing the volleyball court and locker room with a male student, the coach retaliated \n12 by removing them from team group chats and communications, and telling one of the girls, “If you \n13 want to be a captain and a member of our team, then be one.”\n14 5. Plaintiffs have been intimidated by an intentionally hostile environment created by \n15 Defendants wherein they were bullied by school officials to censor their objections to competing \n16 with, and against, a male and to sharing intimate and private spaces with a male. \n17 6.  As recognized by California Governor Gavin Newsom in 2025, it is “deeply unfair” \n18 unfair for girls to compete against boys.2\n19\n20\n21\n22 1 “Male,” “Female, “Boy,” and “Girl” used in this Complaint refer solely to binary, biological sex and not a person’s \n“gender identity.” See Adams by & through Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 812 (11th Cir. 2022) \n23 (Title IX defines “sex” “based on biology and reproductive function.”); Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979) (“Sex. \nThe sum of the peculiarities of structure and function that distinguish a male from a female organism[.]”); see also \n24 Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., 590 U.S. 644, 655 (2020) (“Sex” in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “refer[s] only to \nbiological distinctions between male and female”); see also Executive Order No. 14168, “Defending Women From \n25 Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” (2025) (“‘Sex’ shall refer to \nan individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female. ‘Sex’ is not a synonym for and does not \n26 include the concept of ‘gender identity.’”). \n27 2Gavin Newsom calls trans sports participation ‘deeply unfair,’ breaking with Democrats, NBC News, \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/california-gov-gavin-newsom-breaks-democrats-trans-\n28 sports-participatio-rcna195165.   \n2\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 3 of 51   Page ID #:3\n1 7. Plaintiffs  seek  relief  because  Defendants’  decision  to  allow  a  male  student to \n2 compete on the 2025–2026 girls’ varsity volleyball team has not only led other schools to forfeit \n3 matches  against  Jurupa  Valley  High  School,  further  depriving  Plaintiffs  of  fair athletic \n4 opportunities, but has also forced Plaintiffs themselves to abstain from participating in games and \n5 practices due to the male athlete’s unlawful participation on their girls’ varsity team.\n6 8. Plaintiffs file this action to stop Defendants’ illegal sex discrimination against female \n7 student athletes. \n8 PARTIES - PLAINTIFFS\n9 9.

PLAINTIFFS’ BACKGROUND\n3 i. Plaintiffs’ Athletic and Academic Background\n4 24. Plaintiffs McPherson, A.M., and H.H. are avid athletes and have dedicated their lives \n5 to high level athletic competition.\n6 25. McPherson is a formerJurupa Valley High School(“JVHS”)multi-sport athlete who \n7 participated in varsity track and field, soccer, and volleyball. She currently competes as a collegiate \n8 volleyball player.\n9 26. As a high school freshman, McPherson played both club and varsity high school \n10 soccer, while also joining a club volleyball program. \n11 27. During her high school sophomore year, McPherson played varsity volleyball, \n12 varsity soccer, and varsity track and field. She served as captain of her volleyball team and \n13 distinguished herself by earning several awards, including Volleyball Offensive MVP All-League, \n14 Soccer League Champion, and multiple All-Academic Awards.\n15 28.  As a high school junior, McPherson served as captain of the girls’ varsity volleyball \n16 team. Under her leadership, the team won a League Championship and the CIF Southern Section \n17 Division 8 Title. McPherson was named League MVP and Athlete of the Month and received an \n18 All-Academic Award. She also continued to compete in varsity soccer and varsity track and field, \n19 where she earned additional awards and recognition. \n20 29. As a high school senior, McPherson maintained her leadership role in volleyball as \n21 varsity captain and continued to play on the varsity soccer team. She continued to receive various \n22 awards, including volleyball All League MVP, Athlete of the Month (8/2023), and multiple All-\n23 Academic Awards across volleyball and soccer. \n24 30. In addition to her athletic skill, McPherson excelled academically, maintaining a \n25 cumulative GPA of 4.0.\n26 31. McPherson’s younger sister, Plaintiff A.M., is also a multi-sport athlete at JVHS, \n27 competing in varsity volleyball, varsity soccer, and track and field. She is currently a senior at JVHS. \n28\n5\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 6 of 51   Page ID #:6\n1 32. As a freshman, A.M. played on the junior varsity volleyball team, where she earned \n2 the Best Defensive Player Award and an All-Academic Award. She also competed on the varsity \n3 soccer team, helping them secure a League Championship and receiving Honorable Mention along \n4 with an All-Academic Award. In addition, she played club volleyball and club soccer.\n5 33. During  her  sophomore  year,  A.M. advanced  to  varsity  volleyball,  where  she \n6 contributed to a League Championship, was named to the First Team, and earned another All-\n7 Academic  Award.  In  varsity  soccer,  she  again helped  capture  a  League  Championship,  was \n8 recognized with a Second Team award, and earned an All-Academic Award. She also competed in \n9 track and field in the 100m and 200m events, starting on junior varsity before earning opportunities \n10 to compete at the varsity level.\n11 34. During her junior year, A.M.continued to excel in volleyball, helping lead the varsity \n12 team to another League Championship.\n13 35. As a senior, A.M. serves as captain of the varsity volleyball team and a starter, \n14 continuing her leadership role on and off the court.On September 2, 2025, she was awarded Athlete \n15 of the Month by Principal Todd Moerer.  \n16 36.  In addition to her athletic skill, A.M. has excelled academically, maintaining a \n17 cumulative GPA of 4.3. \n18 37.  Plaintiff H.H. is also a multi-sport athlete at JVHS, competing in varsity volleyball \n19 and varsity track and field. She is currently a senior at JVHS.\n20 38. During her freshman year, H.H. competed in varsity track and field, participating in \n21 the triple jump, long jump, 200-meter, and 400-meter events. She earned recognition as an All-\n22 Academic  athlete  and  contributed  to  her  team  winning  the  Girls  Mountain  Valley  League \n23 Championship.\n24 39. In her sophomore year, H.H. joined varsity volleyball, where she contributed to the \n25 team winning the League Championship and earned All-Academic honors. The team advanced to \n26 CIF Round 3. H.H. continued competing in varsity track and field, maintaining her All-Academic \n27 status and demonstrating high-level performance across multiple events.\n28\n6\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 7 of 51   Page ID #:7\n1 40. During her junior year, H.H. continued to excel in volleyball and track and field. She \n2 helped  the  varsity  volleyball  team  win  the  League  Championship  and  earned  All-Academic \n3 recognition. In track and field, H.H. competed at the varsity level, again earning All-Academic \n4 honors and consistently placing in competitions.\n5 41. In her senior year, H.H. remains an active member of the varsity volleyball team as \n6 a starter and will again be competing in track and field in the upcoming track and field season. \n7 42. In addition to her athletic skill, H.H. has excelled academically, maintaining a \n8 cumulative GPA of 4.3.\n9 ii. Plaintiffs’ Religious Background\n10 43. Plaintiffs Munoz, McPherson, and A.M. are practicing Catholics who believe that \n11 God created human beings as male and female and that gender is a fixed characteristic that cannot \n12 be changed. Their faith informs their understanding of human identity and shapes their views \n13 regarding the importance of recognizing and honoring the distinctives of male and female as created \n14 by God.\n15 44.  Plaintiffs Hazameh and H.H. are practicing Muslims whose religious obligations \n16 prevent H.H. from exposing her hair or body to males, including by wearing a hijab. Guided by \n17 Islamic teachings, they believe that men and women have distinct biological differences, roles, and \n18 responsibilities, which should be respected and upheld. Their faith emphasizes modesty, dignity, \n19 and the honoring of gender distinctions which must conform with one’ biological sex in both \n20 practice and identity.\n21 45. Based on these sincerely held religious beliefs, Plaintiffs McPherson, A.M., and H.H. \n22 object to sharing locker rooms with members of the opposite sex and to participating on athletic \n23 teams that include members of the opposite sex. Plaintiffs also object to any inappropriate and \n24 unwelcomed physical contact with males. \n25 46. Based on their sincerely held religious beliefs, Plaintiffs Hazameh and Munoz also \n26 object to their daughters being required to share locker rooms or teams with males and inappropriate \n27 physical contact with males. \n28\n7\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 8 of 51   Page ID #:8\n1 47. Due to fear and intimidation caused by school administrators, Plaintiffs have felt \n2 intimidated, silenced. and unable to state their religious objections.  \n3 B. SCOPE OF TITLE IX\n4 48. Congress enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, \n5 to  prohibit  sex-based  discrimination  in  federally  funded  education  programs.  Section  901(a) \n6 provides: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation \n7 in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \n8 activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”\n9 49. Title IX was designed to eliminate significant “discrimination against women in \n10 education” and to ensure that biological women received “equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, \n11 participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities.” See Neal v. \n12 Bd. of Trs. of Cal. State Univs., 198 F.3d 763, 766 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Virginia, 518 \n13 U.S. 515, 532 (1996).\n14 50. Title IX was adopted in response to widespread educational discrimination against \n15 women, particularly in admissions and faculty employment. See H.R. Rep. No. 92-554, at 51–52; \n16 116 Cong. Rec. 6398–6400. \n17 51.  In the hearings on equal rights, Dr. Bernice Sandler called for protections for women \n18 in education because, “Sex prejudice is so ingrained in our society that many who practice it are \n19 simply unaware that they are hurting women. Let me reiterate, –it is the last socially acceptable \n20 prejudice.” Hearings, Ninety-first Congress, second session, on S.J. Res. 61, May 5, 6, and 7, 1970, \n21 p. 415.\n22 52.  Senator  Birch  Bayh, Title  IX’s  chief  sponsor, stated  the  bill  was  designed  to \n23 “guarantee that women, too, enjoy the educational opportunity every American deserves.” 117 \n24 Cong. Rec. 32,476–79; 118 Cong. Rec. 5808 (1972). \n25 53.  Senator Bayh further stressed that Title IX “provide[d] equal access to women and \n26 men” but did not “desegregate” spaces and activities that have long been sex-separated. 117 Cong. \n27 Rec.  30407  (1971).  Senator  Bayh recognized  that  regulations  would  be  necessary  to  “allow \n28\n8\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 9 of 51   Page ID #:9\n1 enforcing agencies to permit differential treatment by sex only, . . . such as . . . in sports facilities or \n2 other instances where personal privacy must be preserved.”118 Cong. Rec. 5807.\n3 54. Title IX does have exemptions that allow for traditionally male-only and female-only \n4 activities, so long as similar opportunities are permitted for the opposite sex. See 20 U.S.C. § 1686; \n5 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.33, 106.41(b).1. \n6 55. Under Title IX, “sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic \n7 determined solely by” biology. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality \n8 opinion). \n9 56. As a whole, biological males have physiological advantages over biological females. \n10 See Clarkv. Arizona Interscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 1982) (“The record makes \n11 clear that due to average physiological differences, males would displace females to a substantial \n12 extent  if  they  were  allowed  to  compete  for  positions  on  the  volleyball  team. Thus,  athletic \n13 opportunities for women would be diminished.”); Cape v. Tennesee Secondary School Athletic \n14 Ass’n, 563 F.2d 793, 795 (6th Cir. 1977) (overturned on other grounds) (“It takes little imagination \n15 to realize that were play and competition not separated by sex, the great bulk of the females would \n16 quickly  be  eliminated  from  participation  and  denied  any  meaningful  opportunity  for  athletic \n17 involvement.”). \n18 57.  Scientific  research  demonstrates  that  biological  males,  on  average,  possess \n19 significant physiological advantages over biological females, including greater height and body \n20 mass, larger and stronger muscles and bones, increased lung capacity, and higher cardiac output. \n21 While these advantages are greatest after puberty, they begin at birth. See, e.g., Frank Falkner, J.M. \n22 Tanner, Human Growth: Postnatal Growth, p. 286 (1976) (“Boys demonstrate, on the average, \n23 greater strength than girls at all ages.”). \n24 58.  As Justice Stevens put it, “[w]ithout a gender–based classification in competitive \n25 contact sports, there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls’ programs and \n26 deny them an equal opportunity to compete in interscholastic events.” O’Connor v. Bd. of Ed. of \n27 Sch. Dist. 23, 449 U.S. 1301, 1307 (1980) (Stevens, J., in chambers). \n28\n9\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 10 of 51   Page ID\n#:10\n1 59. At the time of Title IX’s enactment, the dictionary definitions of “sex” demonstrate \n2 that Congress meant biological sex when it prohibited discrimination on the basis of “sex” in \n3 education. See Adams v. Schl. Bd. of St. Johns Cty., 58 F.4th 791 (2022) (citingSex, American\n4 Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1976) (“The property or quality by which organisms are \n5 classified according to their reproductive functions.”); Sex, American Heritage Dictionary of the English \n6 Language (1979) (same);Sex, Female, Male, Oxford English Dictionary (re-issue ed. 1978) (defining \n7 “sex” as “[e]ither of the two divisions of organic beings distinguished as male and female respectively,” \n8 “female” as “[b]elonging to the sex which bears offspring,” and “male” as “[o]f or belonging to the sex \n9 which begets offspring, or performs the fecundating function of generation”); Sex, Webster's New \n10 World Dictionary (1972) (“[E]ither of the two divisions, male or female, into which persons, animals, \n11 or plants are divided, with reference to their reproductive functions.”); Sex, Female, Male, Webster's \n12 Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1969) (defining “sex” as “either of two divisions of organisms \n13 distinguished respectively as male or female,” “female” as “an individual that bears young or produces \n14 eggs as distinguished from one that begets young,” and “male” as “of, relating to, or being the sex that \n15 begets young by performing the fertilizing function”); Sex, Random House College Dictionary (rev. ed. \n16 1980) (“[E]ither the male or female division of a species, esp. as differentiated with reference to the \n17 reproductive functions.”). \n18 60.  The  Department  of  Health,  Education  and  Welfare  (the  predecessor  to  the \n19 Department of Education) issued regulations for Title IX that took effect in 1975. See 34 C.F.R. § § \n20 106.1-106.82. \n21 61.  These regulations required that, if an entity subject to Title IX provides athletic \n22 programs or opportunities separated by sex, then it must do so in a manner that “provide[s] equal \n23 athletic opportunity for members of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c). \n24 62.  Equal athletic opportunity can be determined by whether such athletic opportunities \n25 “effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c).  \n26 63.  Here, the “governing principle” is that “the athletic interests and abilities of male and \n27 female students must be equally effectively accommodated.” Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. \n28 71,413, 71,414 (1979). \n10 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 11 of 51   Page ID\n#:11\n1 64. More specifically, the District must accommodate the physical abilities of girls “to \n2 the extent necessary to provide equal opportunity in . . . levels of competition,” and competitive \n3 opportunities “which equally reflect their abilities.” Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,417-\n4 418.\n5 65. As  another  aspect  of  equal  athletic  opportunity,  implementing  regulations  and \n6 guidance state that male and female athletes “should receive equivalent treatment, benefits and \n7 opportunities.” Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,415. \n8 66. The “equal treatment” to which girls are entitled includes equal “opportunities to \n9 engage in . . . post-season competition,” id.at 71,416, equal opportunities for public recognition, 34 \n10 C.F.R. § 106.41(c), and the right to be free of any policies which are “discriminatory in . . . effect” \n11 or that have the effect of denying “equality of athletic opportunity.” 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,417.\n12 67. An institution is only in compliance “if the compared program components are \n13 equivalent, that is, equal or equal in effect.” Id. at 71,415.\n14 68. Accordingly, Title IX is understood to require the allocation of equal opportunities \n15 based on biological sex alone without regard to or consideration of gender identity. When an \n16 institution creates a team for one sex, “it must do so for members of the other sex” given certain \n17 conditions are met. Id.  \n18 69.  In 2024, the Biden administration issued provisions aimed at expanding Title IX. The \n19 new regulations stated that Title IX forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \n20 identity.\n21 70. On  January  9,  2025,  a  federal  judge  invalidated  the  Biden  administration’s \n22 regulations citing several legal flaws, including that the United States Education Department \n23 exceeded its authority by expanding the scope of Title IX. Tennessee v. Cardona, No. CV 2:24-072-\n24 DCR, 2025 WL 63795 (E.D. Ky. Jan. 9, 2025), as amended (Jan. 10, 2025).\n25 71. On  January  20,  2025,  President  Donald  Trump  issued  an  Executive  Order \n26 “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the \n27 Federal Government.” See Executive Order 14168(2025) (“EO”).\n28 72. The EO recognized that “ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have \n11 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 12 of 51   Page ID\n#:12\n1 increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women \n2 and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women.” Id. \n3 73. The EO states that it “is the policy of the United Staes to recognize two sexes, male \n4 and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible \n5 reality.”  Under the EO, the “executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this \n6 reality.”\n7 74. Pursuant to EO, the provided definitions for “sex,” “women,” “men,” “female,” and \n8 “male”  “shall  govern  all  Executive  interpretation  of  and  application  of  Federal  law  and \n9 administration of policy.”Id.\n10 75. Specifically, “sex” “shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification \n11 as either male or female. ‘Sex’ is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of ‘gender \n12 identity.’”Id. \n13 76. The EO further recognizes that “gender identity” “reflects a fully internal and \n14 subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite \n15 continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as \n16 a replacement for sex.” Id.  \n17 77.  Pursuant  to  EO,  “[e]ach  agency  and  all Federal  employees  shall  enforce  laws \n18 governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and \n19 women as biologically distinct sexes.” Id.\n20 78. Further, the EO states that “[f]ederal funds shall not be used to promote gender \n21 ideology.” Id.\n22 79. The EO reinstates the federal protections for women under Title IX that the Biden \n23 and Obama administrations attempted tom remove through executive aciton.\n24 80. Title IX may be enforced by a private right of action. Cannon v. University of \n25 Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979). “[A] damages remedy is available for an action brought to enforce \n26 Title IX.” Franklin v. Gwinnet County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 76 (1992).\n27 81. All public schools in California, including JVHS, receive federal funds covered by \n28 Title IX, and thus are subject to the requirements of Title IX. \n12 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 13 of 51   Page ID\n#:13\n1 C. DEFENDANTS’ AUTHORITY OVER ATHLETICS \n2 82. Defendant CDE oversees Defendant CIF, which governs high school athletics in \n3 California. \n4 83. Under the California Education Code, CDE has authority over interscholastic athletic \n5 policies  of  Defendant  CIF  and  local  school  districts,  including  JUSD.  Cal.  Educ.  Code  § \n6 33354(a)(1).\n7 84. CDE is currently, and has been for many years, a recipient of federal financial \n8 assistance from various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Education \n9 (“USDOE”).\n10 85. CIF’s member schools are recipients of federal funding.\n11 86. Under the Implementing Regulations, CDE is required to comply with Title IX, the \n12 Implementing Regulations, and ensure equal athletic opportunities regardless of “any State or local \n13 law . . . rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association.” 34 \n14 C.F.R. § 106.6(b)-(c).\n15 87.  JUSD, CDE, and CIF currently have policies that violate Title IX. These policies \n16 discriminate against girls in interscholastic athletics by mandating that schools allow boys to \n17 compete in girls’ sports, which denies girls equal educational opportunities. These policies also force \n18 girls to share intimate spaces, such as locker rooms, with boys, causing a hostile and unsafe \n19 educational environment that denies girls educational opportunities. \n20 88. JUSD Administrative Regulation 6145.2 (“AR 6145.2”) provides, “[e]ach student \n21 shall be allowed to participate in any single-sex athletic program or activity consistent with the \n22 student’s gender identity, of the gender listed on the student’s records, for which the student is \n23 otherwise eligible to participate.”\n24 89. In 1976, the California legislature enacted California Education Code section 221.5, \n25 which prohibits elementary and secondary schools from discriminating against students based on \n26 their sex in both academic and non-academic courses. \n27 90. Section 221.5 was amended a couple times before Tom Ammiano (D), a member of \n28 the California State Assembly from 2008-2014, introduced AB 1266 in 2013. After the bill passed \n13 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 14 of 51   Page ID\n#:14\n1 both the Assembly and the Senate in summer 2013, Governor Brown signed it into law in August \n2 2013 and AB 1266 became effective on January 1, 2014. \n3 91. Upon  amendment,  California  Education  Code  section  221.5(f)  (or  AB  1266) \n4 provides, “a pupil shall be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, \n5 including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities consistent with his or her gender \n6 identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil’s records.” (emphasis added).\n7 92. The primary goal of AB 1266 was to “take away [] discretion from local school \n8 districts and create a uniform policy for participation in sports.” Assembly Comm. on Educ. AB \n9 1266, p. 2 (2013).\n10 93. The further purpose, according to the primary author of the bill, was to provide \n11 school districts with a method for dealing with transgender students playing sports in schools. \n12 Ammiano reasoned:\n13 [M]any school districts do not understand and are not presently in \ncompliance with their obligations to treat transgender students the \n14 same as all other students in the specific areas addressed by this bill. \nAs a result, some school districts are excluding transgender students \n15 from sex-segregated programs, activities and facilities. Other school \ndistricts struggle to deal with these issues on an ad hoc basis. Current \n16 law is deficient in that it does not provide specific guidance about how \nto  apply  the  mandate  of  non-discrimination  in  sex-segregated \n17 programs, activities and facilities. \n18 Senate Comm. on Educ., AB 1266, p. 4 (2013). \n19 94. Ammiano reasoned that AB 1266 was necessary because:\n20 When transgender students are denied the opportunity to participate \nin physical education classes in a manner consistent with their gender \n21 identity, they miss out on these important benefits and suffer from \nstigmatization and isolation. In addition, in many cases, students who \n22 are transgender are unable to get the credits they need to graduate on \ntime when, for example, they do not have a place to get ready for gym \n23 class.\n24 Assembly Comm. on Educ. AB 1266, p. 3 (2013).\n25 95. CDE currently has posted on its website guidance entitled “Gender Equity/Title IX,” \n26 which states in part: “The laws found in the California Education Code 221.5-231.5 are collectively \n27 known as the Sex Equity in Education Act. These laws expand upon gender equity and Title IX laws \n28\n14 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 15 of 51   Page ID\n#:15\n1 which provide guidance to California’s education system. Each Local Educational Agency (LEA) \n2 will be responsible for following the laws in addition to Title IX requirements.”3\n3 96. Article 30, Section 300(B)(3) of the CIF Constitution and Bylaws (“Girls Team”) \n4 provides: “[w]henever the school provides only a team or teams for girls in a particular sport, boys \n5 shall not be permitted to qualify for the girls team in that sport unless opportunities in the total sports \n6 program for boys in the school have been limited in comparison to the total sports program for the \n7 girls in that school. Permission for boys to qualify for a girls’ teammust be secured through petition \n8 by the school principal to the Federated Council.” CIF Constitution and Bylaws 2025-26 (Girls \n9 Team), https://www.cifstate.org/governance/constitution/Constitution_and_Bylaws.pdf.\n10 97. Article 30, Section 300(D) (“CIF Bylaw 300.D”)specifically requires that California \n11 public high schools participating in interscholastic athletic activities must allow males to participate \n12 in girls’ interscholastic athletics: “All students should have the opportunity to participate in CIF \n13 activities in a manner that is consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed \n14 on a student’s records.” CIF Constitution and Bylaws 2025-26 (Gender Identity Participation), \n15 https://www.cifstate.org/governance/constitution/Constitution_and_Bylaws.pdf.   \n16 98.  On February 12, 2025, the USDOE notified CIF that it was commencing a Title IX \n17 investigation into its provision of student athletics that allows boys to compete in girls’ athletic \n18 programs and to access girls’ spaces, including bathrooms and locker rooms. \n19 99. On April 4, 2025, the USDOE notified CDE that it was commencing a Title IX \n20 investigation into its provision of student athletics that allows boys to compete in girls’ athletic \n21 programs and to access girls’ spaces, including bathrooms and locker rooms. \n22 100. On June 2, 2025, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the Department of \n23 Justice, Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to California public schools informing them that CIF \n24 Bylaw 300.D was facially unconstitutional. \n25\n26\n27\n28 3CDE, Gender Equity/Title IX, https://www.cde.ca.gov/re/di/eo /genequitytitleix.asp. \n15 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 16 of 51   Page ID\n#:16\n1 101. On July 7, 2025, CDE and CIF confirmed they would not voluntarily comply with \n2 Title IX, and the USDOE referred its findings of Defendants’ Title IX violations to the United States \n3 Department of Justice for enforcement.\n4 102. On July 9, 2025, the United States filed a Title IX action against CDE and CIF.\n5 United States of America v. California Interscholastic Federation et al, No. 8:25-cv-01485-CV-JDE \n6 (C.D. Cal. July 9, 2025).\n7 D. DEFENDANTS’  DISCRIMINATION  AGAINST  FEMALE  STUDENTS  IN \n8 ATHLETICS\n9 103. JVHS provides athletic programs separated by sex, including sex-specific track and \n10 field and volleyball teams, with separate boys’ varsity and junior varsity teams and girls’ varsity \n11 and junior varsity teams.\n12 104. By enforcing AB 1266, CIF Bylaw 300.D, and AR 6145.2, Defendants CDE, CIF, \n13 and JUSD, have allowed a male student, A.H., to compete on girls’ sports teams and access girls’ \n14 facilities, including bathrooms and locker rooms. \n15 105.  As a result of A.H.’s participation in the JVHS girls’ athletic program, Plaintiffs have \n16 suffered unfair athletic competition, safety risks, sexual harassment, and deprivation of equal \n17 educational opportunities resulting in harm to Plaintiffs and many other female athletes.\n18 i.  Deprivation Of Fair Athletic Competition \n19 106. A.H. is a twelfth-grade male student athlete at JVHS who is and has been competing \n20 with and against female athletes in numerous sports from 2022 to the present with JUSD. \n21 107. A.H. has competed on the JVHS’s girls’ varsity track and fieldteam since 2022. \n22 108. PlaintiffsMcPherson and H.H., as members of the girls’ varsity track and fieldteam, \n23 were forced to compete with A.H. and lost higher rankings as a result. \n24 109.

In or around March 2023, A.H. posted a TikTok stating, “It must suck to come in \n15\nsecond, while I’m over here getting all the medals,” seemingly taunting McPherson who consistently \n16\ncame in second place behind A.H.  \n17\n112.  Plaintiff Munoz, McPherson’s mother, reported the video to Principal Shelley Morris\n18\nand Assistant Principal Peter Zamora. Principal Morris and Assistant Principal Zamora stated they \n19\nwould  investigate  the  situation.

In addition to his inclusion on the girls’ track and field team, A.H. has been and is\n4 also a current member on JVHS’s girls’ varsity volleyball team.\n5 121. Having competed with A.H. on volleyball, Plaintiffs have observed A.H.’s rapid \n6 athletic development, which they attribute to inherent biological advantages stemming from male \n7 physiology, including height, muscle mass, and vertical jumping ability. \n8 122. Plaintiffs also observed noticeable changes in A.H.’s physicality. Throughout 2023-\n9 2024, A.H. appeared to have undergone significant physical development and growth consistent \n10 with male puberty, including increased musculature, strength, and facial features becoming more \n11 defined.\n12 123. Plaintiffs  observed  that  A.H.  has  progressed athletically far  more  quickly  in \n13 volleyball than every other female athlete on the girls’ varsity volleyball team, including Plaintiffs. \n14 124. Despite Plaintiffs’own year-round training, gym work, club volleyball participation, \n15 and nutritional supplements, they could not overcome the apparent biological advantages of A.H. \n16 125.  Plaintiffs reasonably feared that their season’s accomplishments would be devalued \n17 and invalidated because they were compelled to compete with a male athlete in girls’ volleyball. \n18 126.  Since the commencement of the 2025-2026 volleyball season, at least six schools \n19 have forfeited or canceled their matches against the JVHS girls’ varsity volleyball team. \n20 127.

It was widely reported that each of these six schools forfeited or canceled their \n4 matches against the JVHS girls’ varsity volleyball team because they refused to compete against the\n5 male athlete, A.H.\n6 129. On August 20, 2025, Volleyball Coach Liana Manu gathered the girls’ varsity team \n7 and informed the players, including Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H.,that the game cancellations and further \n8 cancellations were likely because of A.H.’s participation, and that the continuation of the season \n9 depended on whether A.H. chose to step down.\n10 130. Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. expressed that while they respected A.H. as a person, they \n11 wanted to preserve their right to compete and complete their senior season. Nonetheless, the school \n12 administration gave the decision toA.H.on whether to step down, instead of taking action to protect \n13 the female athletes.\n14 131. On August 22, 2025, A.H. informed teammates S.F. and C.O. that Principal Nancy \n15 Reyna had instructed him not to step down from the girls’ volleyball team. That same day, C.O. told \n16 A.M. the same information during 4th-period. \n17 132.  In  a  response  given  to  a  media  outlet  regarding  the  game  forfeitures and \n18 cancellations, JVHS stated:\n19 We understand and acknowledge the disappointment of our Jurupa \nValley High School athletes who are ready and prepared to play. \n20 Decisions to cancel matches were made by teams in other districts. \n21\nAs a public school district in California, JUSD is compelled to follow \n22 the law, which protects students from discrimination based on gender \nidentity and requires that students be permitted to participate on \n23 athletic teams that are consistent with their gender identity (California \nEducation  Code  221.5 (f)).

Invasion of Intimate Spaces\n13\n135. Additionally,  Defendants  have  allowed  A.H.  to  access  intimate  female  spaces, \n14\nincluding locker rooms and bathrooms.\n15\n136.  All Plaintiffs have at various times while students at JVHS, shared a locker room \n16\nwith A.H., which made them feel unsafe and uncomfortable. \n17\n137.  Plaintiffs experienced repeated discomfort when A.H. entered and lingered in the \n18\ngirls’ locker room, often remaining inside after changing and making eye contact with female \n19\nathletes and Plaintiffs while they were changing, which Plaintiffs found invasive and intimidating.\n20\n138. During H.H.’sfreshman year,H.H.and A.H. both enrolled in a 5th-period volleyball \n21\nclass to prepare for team tryouts. On occasion, A.H. entered the girls’ locker room to change clothes\n22\nwhile H.H. was present in the locker room.\n23\n139. Because of her religious obligationsand her own discomfort with sharing an intimate \n24\nspace with a male, H.H. attempted to avoid changing in A.H.’s presence by waiting until A.H. left \n25\nthe locker room, using the nurse’s bathroom, or changing in the volleyball storage room.\n26\n140. H.H. eventually had to expressly ask A.H. not to enter the area when she was \n27\nchanging.\n28\n22 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 23 of 51   Page ID\n#:23\n1 141. Similarly, McPherson and A.M. have experienced discomfort sharing the locker \n2 room with A.H. McPherson and A.M. have on multiple occasions chosen to use the nurse’s \n3 bathroom or the individual stalls within the locker room rather than share space with A.H., because \n4 they felt uncomfortable with A.H.’s presence while changing.\n5 142. Using the individual stalls in the locker room was not a workable solution, as the \n6 gaps between stalls allowed visibility from the outside. \n7 143. Similarly, using the nurse’s bathroom was not feasible because it separated Plaintiffs\n8 from their team, depriving them of the comradery, instruction, and discussion that often takes place \n9 in the locker room. Further, the nurse’s bathroomwas located a considerable distance from the girls’ \n10 locker room. This arrangement also created difficulties during away games as the girls did not \n11 always have access to the nurse’s bathroom.\n12 144. These measures taken by Plaintiffs to preserve their privacy and comply with their \n13 religious beliefs have created a stressful and uncomfortable environment. The need to avoid A.H.\n14 while changing has interfered with their ability to fully and comfortably participate in athletic \n15 activities. \n16 145.  The circumstances in the locker room demonstrate the impact of the shared space on \n17 Plaintiffs, creating hostile conditions that require them to take extraordinary measures to protect \n18 their religious practices, personal dignity, and sense of safety while participating in school athletics. \n19 iii. Sexual Harassment\n20 146. Beyond the locker room, A.H. engaged in unwelcomed and offensive contact, \n21 including slapping and/or placing his hands on female players’ buttocks, including Plaintiffs,during \n22 practices, games, and huddles. \n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n23 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 24 of 51   Page ID\n#:24\n1 147. On or about August 16, 2024, during a match against Hillcrest High School, Plaintiff \n2 Munoz, who routinely filmed games, observed and recorded that A.H. regularly placed his hands \n3 on Plaintiffs and their teammates’ buttocks during play and team huddles. Attached is a true and \n4 correct image of A.H. (No. 4) with his hands on A.M.’s and H.H.’s buttocks:\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n \n17\n148.  Plaintiffs felt violated and objectified by A.H.’s repeated inappropriate touching.\n18\n149. In addition to experiencing physical discomfort in the locker room and during team \n19\nactivities, Plaintiffs have been subjected to repeated and unwelcome sexual comments and remarks \n20\nin the athletic environment, creating an offensive atmosphere.\n21\n150. In August 2023, during a summer practice, A.M. dove for a ball and landed on her \n22\nchest. When she remarked about the pain, A.H. interjected, “Right, it hurts my boobs too when I \n23\nland on them.” This comment, made by a male, mocked A.M.’s anatomy and left her embarrassed \n24\nand uncomfortable.\n25\n151.  In October 2023, before a home volleyball game, A.H. complained toPlaintiff A.M. \n26\nthat he was having “cramps” and “on his period.” This statement caused shock and discomfort to\n27\nA.M. because A.H.’s statement is a mere fantasy and marginalizes the pain shared by most women.\n28\n24 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 25 of 51   Page ID\n#:25\n1 152. On or about July 15, 2024, Plaintiffs McPherson and A.M. hosted a team bonding \n2 event for the girls’ varsity volleyball team at their home.\n3 153. During the gathering, several girls engaged in casual conversation regarding their \n4 menstrual cycles.\n5 154. At that time, A.H. interjected and stated, “I don’t have to worry about that, I have a \n6 custom coochie.”\n7 155. This remark was sexual in nature and made Plaintiff McPherson and Plaintiff A.M., \n8 who were both present, uncomfortable.\n9 156. A.H.’s commentcontributed to McPherson’sgrowing sense that it would be difficult \n10 for her to enjoy her senior year under the circumstances created by A.H.’s continued presence on \n11 the girls’ teams.\n12 iv. Physical Harm\n13 157. A.H.’s inclusion in JVHS’s girls’ athletic program creates a dangerous environment \n14 that has resulted in physical harm to Plaintiffs and other female athletes. \n15 158.  In addition to competitive inequity, A.H.’s presence creates ongoing safety concerns. \n16 A.H. has the strength to hit balls at a force greater than most female athletes yet lacks the skill to \n17 consistently control his strikes. On multiple occasions, A.H. struck opposing players’ heads with \n18 the ball. \n19 159. Rather than expressing remorse when the players were injured, A.H. laughed, tapped \n20 his own head, and celebrated the point, even when it resulted in humiliating or injuring another \n21 player.\n22 160. In or around September 2024, during fifth period, A.H. boasted to A.M. and another \n23 student that he had recently caused three female volleyball players to suffer possible concussions.\n24 161. These  incidents  were  unsafe,  inappropriate,  and  damaging  to  the  integrity  of \n25 competition.\n26 162. In response, Coach Fernando Centeno restricted A.H. to hitting only from the back \n27 row. However, A.H. often ignored these instructions and attacked from the front row with force far \n28 exceeding female standards of play, endangering Plaintiffs and their teammates.\n25 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 26 of 51   Page ID\n#:26\n1 163. In September 2024, while warming up before a home game, A.M. was paired with \n2 A.H. for drills. A.H., lacking control but wielding male strength, spiked a ball directly into A.M.’s \n3 face, striking her right side and leaving visible redness and causing her pain.\n4 164. Crying and holding her face, A.M. immediately went to her mother, Plaintiff Munoz, \n5 who was working in the snack bar, and reported that A.H. had spiked a ball directly into her face. \n6 Assistant Principal Zamora, who was standing next to Plaintiff Munoz, did not initiate concussion \n7 protocol, arrange for medical evaluation, or prepare an incident report. Instead, he merely asked if \n8 A.M. needed ice. A.M. held a cold soda can to her face, continued playing in the game, and later \n9 developed a headache.\n10 165. Assistant  Principal  Zamora’s  failure – along  with  that  of  other  school \n11 administrators—to respond appropriately left A.M. feeling disregarded, unsafe, and unsupported in \n12 her athletic environment. \n13 v. Failure of Administrators To Address Plaintiffs’ Concerns\n14 166. Plaintiffs have raised concerns with various school administrators about safety, \n15 fairness, discomfort, and fear resulting from A.H.’s inclusion on the girls’ team, yet the school has \n16 taken no remedial action. \n17 167.  From 2022-2024, on a nearly weekly basis during the volleyball pre-season and \n18 season, McPherson engaged in conversations with Coach Manu about her discomfort with A.H.’s \n19 presence on the volleyball team and in the locker room and the unfair nature of having a male on \n20 the girls’ team.\n21 168. In response, Coach Manu repeatedly told McPherson to “focus on herself” and \n22 “control what she could control.”\n23 169. However, McPherson could not control the fact that A.H. was permitted on the girls’ \n24 sports teams or permitted in the girls’ locker room. \n25 170. McPherson’s concerns and complaints regarding A.H.’s participation on the girls’ \n26 sports teams and permission to be in the girls’ locker room were ignored and left unaddressed.\n27\n28\n26 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 27 of 51   Page ID\n#:27\n1 171. In or around September 2022, Plaintiff McPherson, and her mother, Plaintiff Munoz, \n2 met with a school counselorto address the unfairness of allowing a male student, A.H., to participate \n3 on the girls’ volleyball team. \n4 172. Plaintiffs McPherson and Munoz also raised concerns about privacy within the \n5 locker room due to A.H. lingering in the locker room and watching the girls. Plaintiffs McPherson \n6 and Munoz explained to the school counselor that McPherson and A.M. were uncomfortable \n7 changing in the presence of a male student. \n8 173. Plaintiff McPherson described the experience as feeling “like changing in the street” \n9 and “exposing herself for all to see.” \n10 174. Plaintiff McPherson also reported to the school counselor that A.H. touched her and \n11 Plaintiff A.M.’s buttocks during volleyball activities. Plaintiff McPherson emphasized that this \n12 contact was inappropriate and made her feel uncomfortable. \n13 175. McPherson  raised  additional  concerns  regarding  A.H.’s  participation,  including \n14 athletic advantages due to male physiology and puberty. \n15 176.  In response, the school counselor advised McPherson and A.M. that they could use \n16 the nurse’s restroom to change. She further stated that the school was “following state law.” She \n17 indicated that McPherson’s and Munoz’s other concerns would be addressed at a “later time.” \n18 177.  The school counselor’s suggestion that the girls use the nurse’s bathroom appeared \n19 to favor A.H. at the expense of the other girls, requiring them to adjust their schedules to avoid the \n20 girls’ locker room. \n21 178. Using the nurse’s bathroom was not feasible because it separated Plaintiffsfrom their \n22 team, depriving them of the comradery, instruction, and discussion that often takes place in the \n23 locker room. Further, the nurse’s bathroom was located a considerable distance from the girls’ \n24 locker room. This arrangement also created difficulties during away games as the girls did not \n25 always have access to the nurse’s bathroom.\n26 179. Days later, McPherson and her mother, Plaintiff Munoz, met with Assistant Principal \n27 Zamora to raise the same concerns brought before the school counselor. Plaintiff Munoz asked about \n28 how the school was protecting her daughters’ privacy, safety, andspace. Assistant Principal Zamora \n27 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 28 of 51   Page ID\n#:28\n1 stated that the school was “following state law” and again reiterated that the girls could use the \n2 nurse’s bathroom. He further stated that the “butt touching” was a “difficult situation” but that he \n3 would discuss boundaries with the coach. \n4 180. After these meetings, McPhersonfelt that she was forced to sacrifice her privacy and \n5 safetyin order to continue participating in a sport she lovedand to continue accessingfemale spaces. \n6 181. Given the school’s lack of support, she told her mother she feared retaliation from \n7 teammates for speaking up. A.M. similarly feared backlash and questioned why the school would\n8 not protect the rights of the female athletes. \n9 182. As a result of these events and ongoing concerns regarding the male athlete’s \n10 participation in the girls’ volleyball program, McPherson and A.M.’s parents advised the girls to \n11 step away from participation in the volleyball team. The girls expressed frustration, stating, “Why \n12 should we have to step down? It should be A.H.”\n13 183. On or about August 2023, Coach Manu came to Plaintiffs McPherson and A.M.’s \n14 home to pick up tie-dye shirts made for a fundraiser. During this visit, Plaintiffs’ parents, including \n15 Plaintiff Munoz, expressed concerns about A.H. participating on the girls’ volleyball team and using \n16 the locker rooms, again raising issues of safety, fairness, privacy, and the “butt tapping.” \n17 184.  Plaintiffs’ parents, including Plaintiff Munoz, noted that A.H. appeared to be going \n18 through  puberty,  with  increased  strength  and male  physical  characteristics,  and  raised  safety \n19 concerns about the female athletes sharing both the court and locker room with A.H.\n20 185. In response, Coach Manu stated that she would tell them the same thing she told \n21 McPherson  when  she  raised  similar  concerns  about  A.H.:  “Focus  on  yourself  and  let  the \n22 administration deal with that.”\n23 186. Plaintiffs’ parents, including Plaintiff Munoz, were confused and angered by this \n24 response, as they understood Coach Manu to be part of the school staff and directly involved with \n25 the team.\n26 187. After Coach Manu left, McPherson and A.M. told their parents, “We told you, they \n27 don’t care.”\n28\n28 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 29 of 51   Page ID\n#:29\n1 188. In or around September 2023, McPherson, continuing to feel uneasy about having to \n2 compete with A.H.and share the locker room with him, met with Assistant Principal Zamora, along \n3 with Plaintiff Munoz, to express her ongoing concerns regarding A.H.’s participation on the girls’ \n4 volleyball team. McPherson and Munoz specifically raised issues ofathletesbeing required to share \n5 a locker room with a male, the repeated “butt tapping” by A.H. after every point, and the unfairness \n6 of the situation.\n7 189. Assistant Principal Zamora responded that the school was following state law but \n8 stated that the concerns would be brought to Principal Morris and Coach Manu.\n9 190. When McPherson returned home, she told her mother and A.M. that the school \n10 continued  to  repeat  the  same  response  about  following  state  law.  McPherson  expressed \n11 disappointment, asking, “How could they allow a biological male to touch my behind and I have to\n12 pretend it’s okay?”\n13 191. A.M. responded that raising concerns was a waste of time because “they don’t care.”\n14 192. On October 25, 2023, McPherson and her mother, Plaintiff Munoz, were summoned \n15 to a meeting with Principal Morris and Assistant Principal Zamora.\n16 193.  During the meeting, McPherson was confronted with accusations allegedly raised by \n17 A.H. and his mother. A.H.’s mother had complained that McPherson told teammates what to do and \n18 that  A.H.  did  not  like  being  directed  by  her. A.H.  further  complained  that  McPherson  was \n19 “slandering the transgender community” and expressed personal dislike toward her.\n20 194. McPherson explained that, as captain, she regularly directed teammates during \n21 games  and  practices  but always  did  so  respectfully  and  with  the  intent  of  improving  team \n22 performance.\n23 195. McPherson further explained that the only statement she had ever made regarding \n24 transgender participation in athletics occurred the prior year, when she expressed her belief to a \n25 friend that it was unfair for biological males to compete in girls’ sports. McPherson emphasized that \n26 she had never referred to A.H. by name.\n27\n28\n29 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 30 of 51   Page ID\n#:30\n1 196. McPherson  also  told  school  administrators  that,  rather  than  A.H.  being  held \n2 accountable, she felt she was the one being punished,forced to sacrifice her own safety and comfort \n3 on the court and in the locker room. \n4 197. School administrators did not provide any support or response to McPherson’s \n5 concerns. \n6 198. In or around April 2024, McPherson, A.M. and their mother, Plaintiff Munoz, \n7 attended a boys’ volleyball game. After the game, Coach Makini Manu (“Coach Mak”), Coach \n8 Manu’s husband, approached Plaintiff Munoz and stated, “My wife and I told [A.H.], you should \n9 try out for the boys’ program. [A.H.] would have the strongest hit out of all the boys.”\n10 199. Coach Mak further explained to Plaintiff Munoz that A.H.sometimes attended boys’ \n11 practices.\n12 200. These statements reinforced Plaintiffs’ belief that school administrators prioritized \n13 accommodating A.H.’s interests and celebrating his skillsover protecting the rights and interests of \n14 the female athletes, including Plaintiffs.\n15 201.  Throughout July and August 2024, McPherson repeatedly complained to Coach \n16 Manu – on a weekly basis – about the significant increase in A.H.’s strength and male physical \n17 characteristics. \n18 202.  McPherson expressed concern that A.H.’s presence would tarnish the athletic records \n19 of female athletes, as A.H.’s male strength and lack of ball control created a risk of physical injury \n20 toherself andother playersand disadvantaged the other female teams. McPherson further noted that \n21 A.H.’s jumping ability and power gave him an unfair advantage.\n22 203. McPherson reported that the situation with A.H. was dangerous, but Coach Manu \n23 repeatedly told her that it was “out of her control” and advised her to “focus on yourself.”\n24 204. McPherson felt increasingly dismissed by these responses, and A.M. began to feel \n25 hopeless as well, questioning how she could raise concerns if her older sister, McPherson, as team \n26 captain, could not.\n27 205. Plaintiff  H.H.  was  likewise  compelled  to  refrain  from  raising  objections  or \n28 expressing safety and fairness concerns regarding A.H.’s inclusion on her volleyball team, having \n30 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 31 of 51   Page ID\n#:31\n1 observed  that  McPherson’s  prior  complaints  were  disregarded  by  school  administrators  and \n2 reasonably fearing retaliation from teammates and/or school officials.\n3 206. During the 2024-2025 season, A.M., who played libero, was regularly required to \n4 receive A.H.’s hits. She complained on multiple occasions to Coach Manu and Coach Mak that \n5 A.H.’s hits were stronger than those of all the players in the boys’ volleyball program.\n6 207. Neither coach provided any remedial measures to Plaintiffs’concerns. \n7 208. In or around September 2024, McPherson met with Assistant Principal Denise Lopez \n8 to report that the issues with A.H. were ongoing. McPherson explained that she felt uncomfortable \n9 because A.H. lingered in the locker room after changing and stared at other female athletes. She told \n10 Dr. Lopez this was unfair and uncomfortable.\n11 209. McPherson further reported that, as captain of the varsity team, several freshmen and \n12 other teammates, including Plaintiff H.H., had confided in her that they also felt uncomfortable \n13 changing in the locker room with A.H. These players stated they did not feel safe raising concerns \n14 with Coach Manu, whom they perceived as unapproachable, and feared retaliation.\n15 210.  McPherson again raised the issue of A.H. “butt tapping,” stating it was inappropriate \n16 and made her uncomfortable. She also reported A.H.’s July 2024 sexually explicit comment and \n17 other inappropriate comments made by A.H mocking female anatomy. \n18 211.  McPherson emphasized that even her Muslim teammate, Plaintiff H.H., along with \n19 the other female athletes, should not be forced to sacrifice privacy and comfort in order to \n20 participate.\n21 212. Assistant Principal Lopez told McPherson thatthe school was required to follow state \n22 law. Assistant Principal Lopez advised that if other teammates did not feel safe, they should come \n23 speak to her directly. She further acknowledged that “butt tapping” was not acceptable and stated \n24 she would address it with the coach.\n25 213. McPherson,  having  heard  similar  “promises”  with  no  resolution,  felt  that  no \n26 meaningful changes would be made. She encouraged younger teammates to report concerns to \n27 Assistant Principal, and once again the administration responded only that they would “investigate” \n28 the issue of butt touching.\n31 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 32 of 51   Page ID\n#:32\n1 214. School  administrators  continued  to  not  address,  respond,  or  resolve,  Plaintiffs \n2 concerns regarding A.H.’s inclusion on the girls’ volleyball team. \n3 215. On or about October 2024, McPherson and her mother, Plaintiff Munoz were called \n4 into a meeting with Principal Reyna, during which McPherson was again accused of “slandering the \n5 transgender community.”\n6 216. Plaintiff Munoz explained to Principal Reyna that there had been multiple ongoing \n7 issues with A.H., including privacy concerns in the locker room, A.H. lingering in the locker room \n8 after changing in a stall, and inappropriate comments mocking female anatomy. McPherson also \n9 reiterated how uncomfortable A.H.’s comments and actionsmade her and also how unfair it was for \n10 a male to compete on the girls’ team. \n11 217. Rather than addressing these concerns, Principal Reyna immediately warned Plaintiff \n12 McPherson that if she made any comments to her peers about transgender students or about A.H., it \n13 would result in suspension.\n14 218. Plaintiff McPherson explained that she was merely describing her own experiences \n15 and further clarified that the only comment she had made publicly was when she stated to a friend \n16 that playing with a transgender student was unfair because “biology is a proven fact that males don’t \n17 belong in women’s sports.” She never mentioned A.H. by name in those comments. \n18 219.  Despite this, Principal Reyna warned Plaintiff McPherson again that any remarks \n19 about transgender students or A.H. would be deemed bullying and grounds for suspension.\n20 220. Plaintiff McPherson cried during the meeting, questioning why she was being \n21 punished for expressing her discomfort, asking: “How is this possible? I have to change in the locker \n22 room with a male,and I have to compete with a male that doesn’t belong on the girls’ team. How is \n23 this legal?” No response was given to this question.\n24 221. Principal Reyna also stated, “I don’t know what happened in the past. This is my first \n25 year here, and I can only go from here,” before again warning that any such remarks would lead to \n26 suspension.\n27\n28\n32 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 33 of 51   Page ID\n#:33\n1 222. Plaintiff Munoz asked how this could be fair to her daughters when staff members –\n2 including Assistant PrincipalZamora, teachers, counselors, and other coaches–were already aware \n3 of the issues Plaintiffs had endured.\n4 223. Principal Reyna responded by telling Plaintiff McPherson that she knew she had the \n5 opportunity to play in college and should remain quiet because she had “too much to lose.”\n6 224. McPherson left the meeting in tears, feeling that the school had again taken A.H.’s \n7 side and dismissed her valid concerns. She and Plaintiff Munoz cried afterward, feeling that they \n8 had been treated as though they were the problem.\n9 225. At home, the family discussed the meeting. Plaintiff A.M. responded: “It’s like the \n10 school is pushing us to allow being seen nearly naked by a male, being touched inappropriately, and \n11 we’re the problem! I’m done! This school is awful and won’t protect us.”\n12 226. On July 28, 2025, during a team practice, A.M. raised safety and fairness concerns \n13 with Coach Manuabout A.H.’s continued participation on the team. Coach Manu told A.M. that, as \n14 team captain, she needed to “be friends with A.H. and the group that supported A.H.,” both on and \n15 off the court.  \n16 227.  Coach Manu’s comments placed coercive pressure on A.M. to adopt a certain \n17 viewpoint regarding male participation on girls’ sports team, to associate socially with A.H. as a \n18 condition of leadership, and to keep her views and concerns to herself.\n19 228. On August 22, 2025, Plaintiff Munoz called Assistant Principal Todd Moerer to \n20 object to the unfairnessA.M. was experiencing as a result of A.H.’s inclusion on the girls’ volleyball \n21 team and to raise Title IX concerns. Assistant Principal Todd Moerer responded that the school was \n22 “following state law” and dismissed concerns about Title IX and federal protections as “over my \n23 pay grade.”\n24 229. On August 25, 2025, Plaintiff Munoz and her daughter, A.M., met with the District’s \n25 Title IX Coordinator, Olga Alferez, and raised concerns about locker room privacy, safety, game \n26 cancellationscause by A.H., retaliation, and unfair practice and game conditions.She also reiterated \n27 her objection to A.H. touching her daughter’s buttocks. A.M.’s mother was told that an investigation \n28 would be “initiated.”  \n33 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 34 of 51   Page ID\n#:34\n1 230. Plaintiffs Munoz and A.M. again reported A.H.’s sexualized comments to school \n2 administrators, including Principal Reyna and Title IX Coordinator Olga, but their concerns were \n3 ignored, and no remedial action was taken.  \n4 231. Since at least 2022, JVHS has not provided any remedies for Plaintiffs, and JUSD \n5 has continued to allow A.H. to compete in JVHS’s girls’ athletic program.\n6 232. On  September  4,  2025,  despite  the  ongoing  lack  of  support  from  school \n7 administrators, Plaintiff Munoz and A.M. met with Principal Reyna to raise their ongoing concerns \n8 regarding A.H.’s involvement in the girls’ athletic program. \n9 233. Plaintiffs Munoz and A.M. again reiterated to Principal Reyna their safety, privacy, \n10 and fairness concerns regarding A.H.’s presence in the locker room, his participation on the girls’ \n11 volleyball team, his inappropriate sexual comments, and his offensive touching of Plaintiffs’ A.M. \n12 and H.H.’s buttocks.\n13 234. Principal Reyna represented that she would “investigate” but emphasized that “the \n14 school was following state law.”\n15 235.  On September 4, 2025, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. separately informed Coach Manu \n16 that they were uncomfortable sharing the court or locker room with a male athlete and stated that \n17 they could no longer participate in games or practices that included a male athlete.  Coach Manu did \n18 not address their concerns and simply responded, “Ok thank you for letting me know.”\n19 236. On September 5, 2025, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. discovered they had been removed \n20 from the varsity volleyball group chats. This was shocking and hurtful to them as Coach Manu had \n21 neither informed them of this action nor followed up with them regarding their September 4 \n22 messages. \n23 237. On September 5, 2025, Plaintiff A.M. and Coach Manu engaged in the following text \n24 thread:\n25 Plaintiff A.M.: hey coach i just noticed i have been kicked off the \nvarsity group chat, does this mean you’re kicking me off the team?\n26\nCoach Manu: Hey, no, no one kicked you off the team. But my \n27 question to you is –if you’re stepping back and not participating with \nour team, do you even want to be in the group chat? I’m not sure what \n28 you’re looking for moving forward as far as me and the team goes. \n34 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 35 of 51   Page ID\n#:35\n1 Plaintiff A.M.: but why take me off without asking me? \n2 I’m waiting to hear from principal reyna.\n3 Coach Manu: Well, I don’t have to ask you; I don’t have to run my \ndecisions by you or any player. Any time someone has chosen not to \n4 participate any longer, I remove them from the group chats they’re in \nor even Band as a whole. That’s not abnormal because theres no point \n5 in them being in the chats if they’re not participating.\n6 You’re  wait [sic] to  hear  from  principal  Reyna  about  .  .  .?\nParticipating?\n7\nPlaintiff A.M.: as a captain and a member of the team, i should not \n8 be removed from the team chats. i’m still a part of the team, never did \ni ever state that i quit. \n9\nCoach Manu:If you want to be a captain and a member of our team, \n10 then be one.\nShow up, be a team member.Lead, be a captain to your team. Also, I \n11 did not remove you from the group chat.\n12 This is an extremely confusing situation, which is why I said I’m not \nsure what you’re looking for as far as continuing the season goes.. you \n13 are not quitting, but you’re quitting practicing and playing? So with \nthe team being how it is, what would you like to do moving forward? \n14 What are you looking to participate in?\n15 238.  After Plaintiff H.H. asked why she had been removed from the varsity team chats, \n16 Coach Manu responded by posing similar questions to her as those directed at A.M. \n17 239.  Plaintiff A.M. was injured last volleyball season and did not “participate” in games \n18 or practices. At that time, she was never removed from the team chats. \n19 240. These statements and actions were hurtful and confusing to A.M. and H.H. and \n20 confirmed their fears that speaking up about their concerns regarding sharing a court and locker \n21 room with a male athletewould result in retaliation and negative treatment.\n22 241. Coach  Manu  retaliated  against  A.M.  and  H.H.  for  expressing  their  views  by \n23 removing them from the team chats, and further reprimanded A.M. regarding how she should \n24 conduct herself as team captain.\n25 242. The cumulative effect of A.H.’s sexual comments, combined with the offensive \n26 physical  contact  and  sexual  harassment,  dangerous  athletic  incidents,  and  failure  of  school \n27 administrators to provide any remedial action, has further exacerbated the sex-discrimination faced \n28 by Plaintiffs.\n35 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 36 of 51   Page ID\n#:36\n1 243. From now until the end of the season, Plaintiffs’ A.M. and H.H. will be forced to sit \n2 out of their volleyball season or be required to compete and practice alongside A.H. and share \n3 intimate spaces with A.H. Additionally, H.H. plans to participate in the upcoming track and field \n4 season, and Plaintiffs anticipate that A.H. will also compete in that seasonunder the same conditions \n5 that Defendants have required for volleyball.\n6\n7 (Violation of Title IX –Sex Discrimination)\n8 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.\n9 244. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein, as though fully set forth, Paragraphs 1 \n10 through 243of this Complaint.\n11 245. Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \n12 excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \n13 any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).\n14 246. At all relevant times, Defendants CDE and JUSD have been recipients of federal \n15 financial assistance within the meaning of Title IX and are therefore subject to its provisions.Under \n16 the California Education Code, Defendant CDE has authority over interscholastic athletic policies \n17 of Defendant CIF and local school districts, including JUSD. Cal. Educ. Code § 33354(a)(1).\n18 247. AB 1266, CIF Bylaw 300.D, and AR 6145.2, on their face and as applied, have \n19 subjected Plaintiffs to discrimination and unequal opportunity on the basis of sex, in violation of \n20 Title IX.\n21 A. Sex Discrimination -Sexual Harassment\n22 248. Plaintiffs were subjected to sexual harassment  that was severe, pervasive, and \n23 objectively offensive, including repeated incidents in which A.H., a male student, slapped their \n24 buttocks after scoring points during volleyball matches and inappropriately touched their buttocks \n25 during team huddles. Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n26 652 (1999).\n27\n28\n36\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 37 of 51   Page ID\n#:37\n1 249. Plaintiffs were also subjected to sexual harassment that was severe, pervasive, and \n2 objectively offensive, including repeated sexualized remarks by A.H., a male student, in which he \n3 mocked and demeaned female anatomy.\n4 250. Plaintiffs, as young women, experienced repeated discomfort and stress, each time \n5 A.H., a male, accessed and lingered in their shared locker rooms.\n6 251. Plaintiffs were forced to take extraordinary measures to protect their privacy and \n7 comply with their religious practices, including using the nurse’s restroom, waiting until A.H. left \n8 the locker room, and modifying participation in athletic activities.\n9 252. Defendants fostered an environment that permitted A.H. to engage in such harassing \n10 conduct through enforcement of AB 1266,CIF Bylaw 300.D, and AR 6145.2. \n11 253. Despite complaints made by Plaintiffs Munoz, McPherson, and A.M. to Coach \n12 Manu, Principal Reya, Principal Morris, Assistant Principal Lopez, and Title IX Coordinator Olga \n13 regarding A.H.’s offensive touching and comments, Defendants acted with deliberate indifference \n14 by failing to take prompt and appropriate corrective action. \n15 254.  As a result, the harassment so undermined and detracted from Plaintiffs’ educational \n16 experience  that  they  were  effectively  denied  equal  access  to  Defendants’  resources  and \n17 opportunities. \n18 255.  Plaintiffs reasonably felt unsafe, disrespected, and humiliated because of A.H.’s \n19 conduct, which created an offensive educational and athletic environment.\n20 B. Sex Discrimination –Failing to Provide Effective Accommodation\n21 256. Defendants provide athletic opportunities in volleyball and track and field that are \n22 separated by sex. \n23 257. Under Title IX, Defendants are obligated to provide competitive opportunities for \n24 female athletes that accommodate their physical abilities, ensuring that female athletes have access \n25 to competitionbased on biological differences between males and femalesthat reflects their abilities \n26 and provides equal opportunity in levels of competition comparable to those available to male \n27 athletes.\n28\n37 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 38 of 51   Page ID\n#:38\n1 258. Due to inherent biological differences between the sexes, the athletic performance of \n2 female athletes is not equivalent to that of comparably trained and fit male athletes. \n3 259. By permitting a male student with the physiological advantages conferred by male \n4 biology to participate in female athletic programs, Defendants have failed to provide competitive \n5 opportunities for female athletes that accommodate their abilities, in violation of their Title IX \n6 obligations.\n7 260. As a direct resultof Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs McPherson and H.H. consistently \n8 lost higher placements in track and field due to A.H.’s participation in JVHS’s girls’ athletic \n9 program. \n10 261. Plaintiffs H.H. and A.M. have also been denied competitive opportunities because \n11 this season, opposing teams have refused to compete against Plaintiffs’ volleyball team due to the \n12 substantial risks posed by A.H.’s presenceon the girls’ volleyball team. This has deprived Plaintiffs \n13 of the opportunity to compete against other female teams, whereas male teams face no comparable \n14 restrictions. \n15 262.  Additionally, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. have refused to participate in games and \n16 practices due to concerns for their safety, privacy, and fairness, resulting in lost athletic opportunities \n17 and diminished participation in the girls’ athletic program because ofA.H.’s inclusion on the team.\n18 263.  The participation of a male athlete in female athletic programs also exposes Plaintiffs \n19 to unsafe athletic conditions, as evidenced by A.H.’s powerful strikes against A.M. and other female \n20 athletes, which have resulted in injury. \n21 C. Sex Discrimination –Failing to Provide Equal Treatment\n22 264. Defendants have an obligation under Title IX to ensure that female athletes receive \n23 treatment, benefits, and opportunities in athletic competition that are equivalent to those provided \n24 to male athletes.\n25 265. Equivalent  treatment  and  opportunities  include  not  only  equal  access  to sex-\n26 segregated competition, but also protection from policies or practices that are discriminatory in \n27 language or effect, or that have the effect of denying female athletes’equality in athletic opportunity.\n28\n38 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 39 of 51   Page ID\n#:39\n1 266. Defendants’ policies and practices deprive female athletes, including Plaintiffs, of \n2 equal opportunities to participate in competition, are discriminatory in effect, and deny female \n3 athletes equality in athletic opportunities, including the opportunity to achieve and be recognized \n4 for competitive success.\n5 267. Plaintiffs McPherson and H.H. consistently lost higher placements in track and field\n6 due to A.H.’s participation in JVHS’s girls’ athletic program. \n7 268. Plaintiffs  H.H.  and  A.M.  have  lost  competitive  opportunities  because \n8 understandably, competitors have refused to compete against Plaintiffs’ volleyball team because of \n9 the substantial risks posed by A.H. playing on Plaintiffs’ team. This has resulted in Plaintiffs losing \n10 the right to compete against female teams from other schools while male teams have no such \n11 challenge. \n12 269. Additionally, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. have refused to participate in games and \n13 practices due to concerns for their safety, privacy, and fairness, resulting in lost athletic opportunities \n14 and diminished participation in the girls’ athletic program because ofA.H.’s inclusion on the team.\n15 270.  Defendants  have  ignored  Plaintiffs  repeated  complaints  and  concerns,  instead \n16 subjecting Plaintiffs to ongoing sexual harassment and sexual discrimination.  \n17 271.  Defendants have threatened suspension, reprimanded Plaintiffs, and have removed \n18 them from team activities for voicing concerns with A.H.’s behavior and continued participation on \n19 the girls’team.\n20 272. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs have suffered \n21 harm, including emotional distress, humiliation, loss of personal dignity, and interference with their \n22 ability to fully participate in athletics and educational programs.\n23 273. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and \n24 punitive damages to the extent permitted by law, attorneys’ fees, costs, and any other relief the Court \n25 deems just and proper.\n26\n27\n28\n39 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 40 of 51   Page ID\n#:40\n1\n2 (Violationof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment –Sex \n3 Discrimination)\n4 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n5 274. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein, as though fully set forth, Paragraphs 1 \n6 through 273of this Complaint.\n7 275. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n8 Constitution guarantees that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \n9 protection of the laws.”\n10 276. AB 1266, CIF Bylaw 300.D, and AR 6145.2, on their face and as applied, have \n11 subjected Plaintiffs to discriminationand unequal opportunitybased onsex, in violation of the Equal \n12 Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n13 277. Defendant, through its policies, practices, or actions, intentionally discriminated \n14 against Plaintiffs based on sex.\n15 278. Specifically, female athletes, including Plaintiffs, were subjected to harassment, \n16 unsafe conditions, and unfair competition due to the inclusion of a male, A.H., on girls’ athletic \n17 teams.\n18 279. A.H. engaged in repeated inappropriate and offensive contact with female athletes, \n19 including touching Plaintiffs’ buttocks during practices, games, and team activities, conduct that \n20 male athletes were not subjected to in comparable circumstances.\n21 280. A.H.  also  made  repeated  sexualized  comments,  including  references  to female \n22 anatomy  and  menstruation,  during  team  activities,  creating  embarrassment,  discomfort,  and \n23 intimidation for Plaintiffs that male athletes were not subjected to in comparable circumstances.\n24 281. Plaintiffs reasonably experienced fear, humiliation, and distress because of these \n25 actions, which interfered with their ability to participate safely and fully in school athletics and \n26 deprived them of educational and athletic opportunities available to their male peers.\n27 282. Defendants,  acting  under  color  of  state  law,  had  actual  knowledge  of  the \n28 discriminatory  treatment  and  harassment,  including  through  complaints  from  Plaintiffs,  but \n40\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 41 of 51   Page ID\n#:41\n1 responded with deliberate indifference, failing to take prompt, effective, or equitable remedial \n2 measures.\n3 283. Due to inherent biological differences between boys and girls which give boys and \n4 overwhelming sport performance advantage over girls, by implementing AB 1266, CIF Bylaw \n5 300.D, and AR 6145.2 Defendants are discriminating against girls by knowingly allowing boys to \n6 deprive girls of equal competitive sport opportunities. \n7 284. Defendants knew that they had purposeful policies, namely AB 1266, CIF Bylaw \n8 300.Dand AR 6145.2, that discriminated against girls by allowing boys to access girls’competitive \n9 athletic opportunities to the detriment of girls. \n10 285. Plaintiffs have further been forced to alter their routines to preserve their safety, \n11 privacy, and religious practices, including Plaintiffs’ need to use the nurse’s bathroom or isolated \n12 stalls to change, and H.H.’s need to shield herself while removing her hijab.\n13 286. Administrators and staff have failed to provide aid, intervene, or take corrective \n14 measures, even when notified of incidents such as A.M. being struck in the face with a ball or A.H.\n15 making inappropriate sexual remarks during practice and games. \n16 287.  The Defendants’ failure to act, coupled with their tolerance of this conduct, has \n17 deprived Plaintiffs of equal access to the educational opportunities and benefits of participation in \n18 athletics on the same terms as their peers. \n19 288. Defendants have threatened suspension, reprimanded Plaintiffs, and have removed \n20 them from team activities for voicing concerns with A.H.’s behavior and continued participation in\n21 the girls’team.\n22 289. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs have suffered \n23 harm, including emotional distress, humiliation, loss of personal dignity, and interference with their \n24 ability to fully participate in athletics and educational programs.\n25 290. Defendants’ acts and omissions constitute intentional discrimination and a violation \n26 of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \n27 States Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n28\n41 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 42 of 51   Page ID\n#:42\n1 291. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, nominal damages, \n2 compensatory and punitive damages to the extent permitted by law, attorneys’ fees, costs, and any \n3 other relief the Court deems just and proper.\n4\n5 (Violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment)\n6 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n7 (Against Defendant JUSD)\n8 292. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein, as though fully set forth, Paragraphs 1 \n9 through 291of this Complaint.\n10 293. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to state and local \n11 governments through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that “Congress shall make no law . . . \n12 prohibiting the free exercise” of religion.\n13 294. Plaintiffs Munoz, McPherson, and A.M. are practicing Catholics who’s sincerely \n14 held religious beliefs teach that God created human beings as male and female, that gender is a fixed \n15 characteristic, and that distinctions between male and female are to be honored as part of God’s \n16 created order.\n17 295. Plaintiffs Hazameh and H.H. are practicing Muslims who’s sincerely held religious \n18 beliefs teach that men and women have distinct biological differences, roles, and responsibilities, \n19 and that modesty—including the obligation for H.H. to cover her hair and body in the presence of \n20 biological males—is a core tenet of their faith.\n21 296. Based on their sincerely held religious beliefs, Plaintiffs object to being compelled \n22 to share locker rooms with members of the opposite sex, to being compelled to participate on athletic \n23 teams with members of the opposite sex, and to being subjected to inappropriate physical contact \n24 from males.\n25 297. Plaintiffs’ religious objections are substantial, central to their practice of their faith, \n26 and sincerely held.\n27 298. Defendants, acting under color of state law, have implemented and enforced policies \n28 and practices that compel Plaintiffs and similarly situated students to:\n42\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 43 of 51   Page ID\n#:43\n1 a. share locker rooms and changing facilities with males;\n2 b. compete on athletic teams with males;\n3 c. endure inappropriate physical contact and sexualized comments by male athletes; \n4 and\n5 d. forego their religious practices of modesty, privacy, and gender distinction.\n6 299. On September 4, 2025, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. separately informed Coach Manu \n7 that they were uncomfortable sharing the court or locker room with a male athlete and stated that \n8 they could no longer participate in games or practices while A.H. remained on the court.  \n9 300. On September 5, 2025, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. discovered they had been removed \n10 from the varsity volleyball group chats. Coach Manu had neither informed them of this action nor \n11 followed up with them regarding their September 4 messages. \n12 301. Plaintiff A.M. and Coach Manu exchanged messages in which Coach Manu told \n13 A.M. that the decision to remove Plaintiffs from the group chats was hers alone, stating, “I don’t \n14 have to ask you; I don’t have to run my decisions by you or any player.”\n15 302.  After A.M. and H.H. shared their concerns about A.H., Coach Manu separately \n16 messaged each of them, stating: “I’m not sure what you’re looking for moving forward as far as me \n17 and the team goes.” \n18 303.  Coach Manu retaliated against A.M. and H.H. for expressing their views regarding \n19 their discomfort with sharing a court and a locker room with a male athlete by removing them from \n20 the team chats, and further reprimanded A.M. regarding how she should conduct herself as team \n21 captain.\n22 304. School administrators also told Plaintiff McPherson that she had “too much to lose” \n23 and  threatened  her  with  suspension  for  speaking  up  about  her  concerns  regarding  A.H.’s \n24 participation on the girls’ volleyball and track and field teams. \n25 305. By conditioning continued participation in athletics on abandoning their religious \n26 convictions, Defendants forced Plaintiffs to choose between practicing their faith and accessing \n27 equal educational and extracurricular opportunities.\n28\n43 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 44 of 51   Page ID\n#:44\n1 306. Such statements and actions demonstrate hostility toward Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs \n2 and confirm that Defendants did not seek to accommodate Plaintiffs’ faith but instead penalized \n3 them for adhering to it.\n4 307. Defendants have further exacerbated the burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise by \n5 refusing to require the male student to use an alternative facility such as the nurse’s restroom. \n6 Instead, Defendants singled out Plaintiffs for disfavored treatment by forcing them to use the nurse’s \n7 restroom or storage closet if they wished to preserve their modesty and adhere to their faith.\n8 308. Defendants’ policies stigmatized Plaintiffs, imposed practical hardships such as the \n9 inability to change during away games, and failed to address the underlying violation of their \n10 religious and privacy rights. Rather than accommodating Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs, Defendants \n11 imposed the entire burden of accommodation on them while privileging the preferences of the male \n12 student.\n13 309. Defendants’ policies and actions are not neutral or generally applicable. By allowing \n14 the male student to access the girls’ locker room while relegating Plaintiffs to the nurse’s restroom, \n15 Defendants have made a value judgment that elevates one set of beliefs and preferences over \n16 Plaintiffs’ religious convictions. \n17 310.  A policy that requires only religious objectors to alter their conduct, while exempting \n18 others who create the conflict, is neither neutral nor generally applicable. Defendants’ enforcement \n19 scheme intentionally burdens religious exercise while accommodating nonreligious conduct.\n20 311. Defendants have threatened suspension, reprimanded Plaintiffs, and have removed \n21 them from team activities for voicing concerns with A.H.’s behavior and continued participation on \n22 the girls’team.\n23 312. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ unconstitutional policies and actions, \n24 Plaintiffs  have  suffered  and  continue  to  suffer irreparable  harm,  including  violation  of  their \n25 constitutional rights, emotional distress and stigmatization. \n26 313. As a result of the actions of the Defendants, Plaintiffs were deprived of their \n27 constitutional right to free exercise of religion and suffered severe emotional distress and injuries \n28\n44 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 45 of 51   Page ID\n#:45\n1 for  which  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  compensation,  nominal \n2 damages, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.\n3\n4 (Violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment)\n5 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n6 (Against Defendant JUSD)\n7 314. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein, as though fully set forth, Paragraphs 1 \n8 through 313of this Complaint.\n9 315. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to state and local \n10 governments through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects the right of students to speak freely on \n11 matters of public concern without fear of retaliation or censorship by school officials.\n12 316. Plaintiffs’ objections to being compelled to compete with and against a male athlete \n13 in girls’ sports, and to share locker rooms with a male, constitute speech on matters of profound \n14 public concern, including fairness in athletics, safety, privacy, and the integrity of girls’ sports.\n15 317. Defendants, acting under color of state law, created and maintained an intentionally \n16 hostile environment designed to suppress Plaintiffs’ views. Plaintiffs were intimidated, threatened, \n17 and pressured to self-censor their objections to competing with and against a male athlete.\n18 318. School administrators warned Plaintiff McPherson that if she made any comments \n19 regarding A.H. or transgender athletes, she would face immediate suspension.\n20 319. McPherson explained that she had only once expressed her views the prior year –\n21 that she believed it was unfair for biological males to compete in girls’ sports – and that she had \n22 never referred to A.H. by name. Despite this clarification, Defendants reiterated that any remarks \n23 on the subject would be treated as bullying and grounds for discipline.\n24 320. During this meeting, Principal Reyna told McPherson to “keep quiet” because she \n25 “had too much to lose” given her opportunities to play collegiate volleyball. These comments were \n26 intended to and did intimidate McPherson into silence, coercing her to abandonher speech rights in \n27 order to avoid suspension and protect her future.\n28\n45\nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 46 of 51   Page ID\n#:46\n1 321. McPherson left the meeting in tears, feeling silenced, unsupported, and retaliated \n2 against for expressing her views. The threats from administrators caused herto refrain from speaking \n3 further about their objections.\n4 322. Plaintiff Munoz felt helpless and felt compelled to self-censor given the lack of \n5 support given to her family when they did raise concerns regarding A.H.’s participation in female \n6 sports to numerous school administrators. \n7 323. A.M.  and  H.H.  were  also  informed  by  what was  said  to  McPherson  and felt \n8 compelled to self-censor out of fear of retaliation or lack of support from school administrators. \n9 324. On July 28, 2025, Volleyball Coach Manu told Plaintiff A.M. that, as team captain, \n10 she needed to “be friends with A.H. and the group that supported A.H.,” both on and off the court. \n11 This directive coerced A.M. to conform her associations and speech to Defendants’ preferred \n12 viewpoint as a condition of team leadership.\n13 325. On September 4, 2025, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. separately informed Coach Manu \n14 that they were uncomfortable sharing the court or locker room with a male athlete and stated that \n15 they could no longer participate in games or practices while A.H. remained on the court.  Coach \n16 Manu responded, “Ok thank you for letting me know.” \n17 326.  On September 5, 2025, Plaintiffs A.M. and H.H. discovered they had been removed \n18 from the varsity volleyball group chats. Coach Manu had neither informed them of this action nor \n19 followed up with them regarding their September 4 messages. \n20 327. Plaintiff A.M. and Coach Manu exchanged messages in which Coach Manu told \n21 A.M. that the decision to remove Plaintiffs from the group chats was hers alone, stating, “I don’t \n22 have to ask you; I don’t have to run my decisions by you or any player.”\n23 328. Coach Manu retaliated against A.M. and H.H. for expressing their views regarding \n24 their discomfort with sharing a court and a locker room with a male athlete by removing them from \n25 the team chats, and further reprimanded A.M. regarding how she should conduct herself as team \n26 captain.\n27\n28\n46 \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 5:25-cv-02362-CAS-SP     Document 1     Filed 09/09/25     Page 47 of 51   Page ID\n#:47\n1 329. Defendants’ actions – including threats of suspension, removal from team chats, \n2 warnings to remain silent, and coercive pressure to associate – constitute viewpoint discrimination, \n3 retaliation, and prior restraint on Plaintiffs’ protected speech.\n4 330. The  restrictions  Defendants  imposed  were  not reasonably  related  to  legitimate \n5 pedagogical concerns or the maintenance of school order. Instead, Defendants targeted Plaintiffs’ \n6 speech because of its viewpoint, silencing disfavored perspectives on a matter of public concern \n7 while permitting opposing views to be expressed.\n8 331. As a result of the actions of the Defendants, Plaintiffs were deprived of their \n9 constitutional right to free speech and suffered severe emotional distress and injuries for which \n10 Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratoryand injunctiverelief, compensation, nominal damages, punitive \n11 damages and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.\n12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n13 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief against defendants as follows:\n14 1.
