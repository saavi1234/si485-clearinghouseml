Plaintiffs the United States of America and the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau (“Bureau”) bring this action against Trustmark National Bank (“Trustmark” or the “Bank”) \nunder the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601–3619, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act \n(“ECOA”),  15  U.S.C.  §§ 1691–1691f,  and  the  Consumer  Financial Protection  Act  of  2010 \n(“CFPA”), 12 U.S.C. § 5536(a)(1)(A).  Plaintiffs allege that Trustmark engaged in a pattern or \npractice of unlawful redlining by structuring its business and outreach efforts so as to avoid the \ncredit needs of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in its residential mortgage lending, \nand thereby engaging in acts or practices directed at prospective applicants that discouraged those \nresiding in, or seeking credit for properties located in, these neighborhoods from applying for \ncredit. \n2.  The FHA and ECOA prohibit creditors, such as banks, from discriminating in home \nloans on the basis of race, color, national origin, and other characteristics.  Under the FHA, it is \nunlawful to discriminate against any person in making available residential real estate-related \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 2 of 18    PageID 2\n \n \ncredit transactions, in making available or denying a dwelling, and in the terms, conditions, or \nprivileges of sale of a dwelling or the provision of services in connection with such a sale, on the \nbasis of race, color, national origin, and other characteristics.  42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a)–(b), 3605(a).  \nUnder ECOA and its implementing regulation, Regulation B, 12 C.F.R. pt. 1002, it is unlawful for \na creditor to discriminate against an applicant in any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of \nrace, color, national origin, and other characteristics.  15 U.S.C. § 1691(a); 12 C.F.R. § 1002.4(a).  \nECOA and Regulation B also prohibit any statements, acts, or practices that would or could \ndiscourage on a prohibited basis an applicant or prospective applicant from applying for credit.  15 \nU.S.C. § 1691(a); 12 C.F.R. § 1002.4(b); 12 C.F.R. pt. 1002, Supp. I, ¶ 1002.4(b)(1). \n3.  “Redlining” is one type of discrimination prohibited under the FHA, ECOA, and \nRegulation B.  Redlining occurs when lenders deny or discourage applications or avoid providing \nloans and other credit services in neighborhoods based on the race, color, or national origin of the \nresidents of those neighborhoods. \n4.  From 2014 through 2018 (the “Relevant Time Period”), Trustmark National Bank \nengaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful redlining.  As alleged in detail herein, Trustmark \navoided providing home loans and other mortgage services and discouraged applications for credit \nfor properties located in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis, Tennessee-\nMississippi-Arkansas Metropolitan Statistical Area (“Memphis MSA”). \n5.  Trustmark’s redlining practices included locating and maintaining nearly all its \nbranch locations and mortgage loan officers in majority-white neighborhoods.  The locations of \nthese branches were listed on Trustmark’s website.  The Bank relied on mortgage loan officers \nconcentrated in majority-white areas as the primary source for generating loan applications and \nconducting outreach, thereby essentially failing to market and advertise in majority-Black and \nHispanic areas.    Further,  the  Bank  maintained  inadequate  internal fair-lending policies and \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 3 of 18    PageID 3\n \n \nprocedures to ensure that the Bank was positioned to provide equal access to credit to majority-\nBlack  and  Hispanic  neighborhoods.    As  a  result  of  these  practices,  the  Bank  generated \ndisproportionately low numbers of loan applications and home loans from majority-Black and \nHispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis MSA compared to similarly-situated lenders. \n6.  Trustmark’s conduct and practices were intended to deny, and had the effect of \ndenying those residing or seeking credit for properties located in majority-Black and Hispanic \nneighborhoods equal access to home loans and otherwise discouraged such individuals from \napplying for home loans.  The Bank’s conduct was not justified by a business necessity and was \nnot necessary to achieve a substantial, legitimate, non-discriminatory interest. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action.  The action arises under \nfederal laws, 12 U.S.C. § 5565(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(h); it presents a \nfederal question, 28 U.S.C. § 1331; and the United States and an agency of the United States bring \nthis action as plaintiffs, 28 U.S.C. § 1345. \n8.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and 12 U.S.C. § 5564(f), and \nvenue is proper in this division, because Trustmark conducts business in, and a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in, this judicial district and division. \nPARTIES \n9.  The United States brings this action to enforce the provisions of the FHA and ECOA.  \nThe FHA and ECOA authorize the Attorney General to bring a civil action in federal district court \nwhenever he has reason to believe that an entity is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to \nthe full enjoyment of rights secured by the FHA and ECOA.  42 U.S.C. § 3614(a); 15 U.S.C. \n§ 1691e(h).  The FHA further authorizes the Attorney General to bring suit where the defendant \nhas denied rights to a group of persons and that denial raises an issue of general public importance.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 4 of 18    PageID 4\n \n \n42 U.S.C. § 3614(a). \n10.  The Bureau is an independent agency of the United States charged with regulating \nthe offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer \nfinancial laws.  12 U.S.C. § 5491(a).  The Bureau has independent litigating authority to enforce \nfederal  consumer  financial  laws,  12  U.S.C.  §  5564(a),  including  ECOA.  12  U.S.C. \n§§ 5481(12)(D), 5481(14). \n11.  Defendant Trustmark National Bank is a national bank headquartered in Jackson, \nMississippi  that  offers  commercial,  consumer,  mortgage,  and  wealth  management  banking \nservices.  The Bank currently operates 196 branches throughout Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, \nTexas, and Florida, including 22 branches in the Memphis MSA.  As of December 31, 2020, \nTrustmark’s total assets equaled $16.550 billion.  From 2014 to 2019, the Memphis MSA was \nconsistently in Trustmark’s top three markets for home mortgage lending. \n12.  Trustmark is subject to the regulatory authority of the Office of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency (“OCC”).  Because its assets exceed $10 billion, Trustmark is also subject to the \nBureau’s authority, including enforcement authority.  12 U.S.C. § 5515(c). \n13.  Trustmark  is  subject  to  the  FHA,  ECOA,  and  their  respective  implementing \nregulations, 24 C.F.R. pt. 100, and Regulation B. \n14.  Trustmark is a “creditor” within the meaning of ECOA, 15 U.S.C. § 1691a(e), \nand is an entity whose business includes engaging in “residential real estate-related transactions” \nunder the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3605. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Memphis MSA and Trustmark’s Assessment Area \n15.  During the Relevant Time Period, the Memphis MSA was comprised of nine \ncounties in three states: Crittenden County in Arkansas; Benton, DeSoto, Marshall, Tate, and \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 5 of 18    PageID 5\n \n \nTunica Counties in Mississippi; and Fayette, Shelby, and Tipton Counties in Tennessee. \n16.  The Memphis MSA has over 1.3 million residents.  According to data from the \nUnited States Census Bureau, in 2018, the region was 45.8 percent non-Hispanic Black (“Black”), \n45.4 percent non-Hispanic white (“white”), and 5 percent Hispanic or Latino.  Almost 50 percent \nof census tracts in the Memphis MSA, or 158 tracts, are majority-Black and Hispanic.  As used in \nthis Complaint, a “majority-Black and Hispanic” tract is one where more than 50 percent of the \nresidents are identified as either “Black or African American” or “Hispanic or Latino” by the \nUnited States Census Bureau.  A “majority-white” tract is one where more than 50 percent of the \nresidents are identified as “non-Hispanic white” by the United States Census Bureau.1 \n17.  Shelby County, Tennessee, where the city of Memphis is located, accounts for a \ndisproportionate share of the Black and Hispanic populations in the Memphis MSA.  Shelby \nCounty has 221 census tracts, of which 138 tracts, or 62 percent, are majority-Black and Hispanic. \n18.  As a depository bank, Trustmark is subject to the requirements of the Community \nReinvestment Act (“CRA”), 12 U.S.C. §§ 2901–2908, and its enabling regulations, which require \ncovered banks to meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve.  Each bank subject to \nthe CRA self-identifies the communities that it serves in the bank’s “assessment areas.”  Federal \nregulators look at a bank’s assessment area in evaluating whether an institution is meeting the \ncredit needs of its entire community. \n19.  Trustmark’s self-designated assessment area consists of three contiguous counties \nwhere approximately 83 percent of the Memphis MSA’s population resides: Shelby and Fayette \nCounties in Tennessee and DeSoto County in Mississippi.  The Bank’s assessment area contains \n90 percent of the majority-Black and Hispanic census tracts in the entire Memphis MSA. \n \n1 The complaint uses “majority-Black and Hispanic census tract,” “majority-Black and Hispanic \narea,” and “majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhood” interchangeably.  The complaint does the \nsame for “majority-white tract,” “majority-white area,” and “majority-white neighborhood.”  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 6 of 18    PageID 6\n \n \nTrustmark’s Memphis MSA Branches Are Concentrated in Majority-White Neighborhoods \n20.  During the Relevant Time Period, Trustmark located its branches in the Memphis \nMSA so as to serve the credit needs of majority-white neighborhoods and avoid serving the credit \nneeds of those residing in or seeking credit for properties located in majority-Black and Hispanic \nneighborhoods. \n21.  During the Relevant Time Period, Trustmark operated between 22 and 25 branches \nin the Memphis MSA.  Eighteen of these branches were “full-service” branches, which offered the \nfull suite of Trustmark’s retail products and services, and at most 7 of these branches were “limited-\nservice” branches, which offered only some products and services.  No “limited-service” branch \naccepted residential mortgage loan applications. \n22.  Although 50% of the census tracts in the Memphis MSA are majority-Black and \nHispanic, during the Relevant Time Period, the Bank maintained only 4 of its 25 total branches in \nmajority-Black and Hispanic areas.  The remaining 21 branches were located in majority-white \nneighborhoods.  See Exhibit A. \n23.  During the Relevant Time Period, 3 of the Bank’s branches located in majority-Black \nand Hispanic neighborhoods were full-service branches.  Two of those 3 branches were established \nor acquired at a time when the surrounding neighborhoods were majority-white but are now located \nin majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, due to population-shifting demographics rather \nthan actions by the Bank to serve Black and Hispanic communities. \n24.  During the Relevant Time Period, only 1 of the Bank’s 7 limited-service branches \nwas located in a majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhood in the Memphis MSA.  The Bank \nclosed that limited-service branch in 2015.  Thus, from 2016 through 2018, the Bank operated no \nlimited-service branch in a majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhood in the Memphis MSA. \n25.  Trustmark first entered the Memphis MSA market in 1987, acquiring 4 branches in \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 7 of 18    PageID 7\n \n \nDeSoto County, Mississippi, all located in majority-white areas. \n26.  Trustmark expanded into Tennessee in 2001, acquiring additional branches in Shelby \nCounty, all located in majority-white areas. \n27.  Since 2001 and through 2018, Trustmark established 4 “de novo” (created, instead \nof acquired) branches in the Memphis MSA.  Three of the 4 branches are located in majority-white \nareas. \n28.  Trustmark knew its branches were not serving the credit needs of majority-Black and \nHispanic areas but did not take steps to address this failure for years. \n29.  By  concentrating  nearly  all  of  its  branches  in  majority-white  neighborhoods, \nTrustmark discouraged residents of, or those seeking credit for properties located in, majority-\nBlack and Hispanic neighborhoods from applying for and obtaining home loans and restricted their \naccess to the Bank’s credit and mortgage lending services. \nTrustmark Concentrated Mortgage Loan Officers and Services in Majority-White \nNeighborhoods While Neglecting the Mortgage Lending Needs of Majority-Black and \nHispanic Neighborhoods \n \n30.  During the Relevant Time Period, Trustmark’s mortgage loan officers served the \ncredit needs of majority-white neighborhoods but did not serve the credit needs of majority-Black \nand Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis MSA, thus discouraging residents of, or those \nseeking credit for properties located in, majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods from applying \nfor and obtaining home loans and restricting their access to the Bank’s credit and mortgage lending \nservices. \n31.  During the Relevant Time Period, Trustmark maintained only 3 full-service branches \nin majority-Black and Hispanic census tracts; the other 15 full-service branches were located in \nmajority-white census tracts.  During the Relevant Time Period, the Bank assigned all of its \nmortgage loan officers to its branches in majority-white areas; it did not assign a single mortgage \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 8 of 18    PageID 8\n \n \nloan  officer  to  any  of  Trustmark’s  branches  located  in  majority-Black  and  Hispanic \nneighborhoods. \n32.  In the majority-white neighborhoods in the Memphis MSA where mortgage loan \nofficers  were  assigned  branch  offices,  mortgage-lending  services  were  available  to  walk-in \ncustomers.  These services were not available in the majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods \nwhere loan officers were not assigned branch offices. \n33.  During the Relevant Time Period, Trustmark relied almost entirely on mortgage loan \nofficers, all of whom were assigned offices in branches in majority-white neighborhoods, to \ndevelop  referral  sources,  conduct  outreach  to  potential  customers,  and  distribute  marketing \nmaterials related to the Bank’s mortgage lending services. \n34.  The Bank did not monitor or document where its mortgage loan officers developed \nreferral sources or to whom loan officers distributed marketing or outreach materials related to \nmortgage lending services to ensure that such sources or distribution occurred in all neighborhoods \nthroughout the Memphis MSA. \n35.  The Bank took no meaningful steps to supplement the efforts of mortgage loan \nofficers to generate mortgage loan applications from majority-Black and Hispanic areas in the \nMemphis MSA. \n36.  The Bank’s marketing strategy in the Memphis MSA was focused on developing \ncommercial business, with an emphasis on “brand messaging,” or generic advertising emphasizing \nTrustmark’s “brand” as a reliable community institution offering an omnibus of products and \nservices.  Accordingly, during the Relevant Time Period, the majority of the Bank’s print or digital \nadvertising  appeared  in  business-focused  publications,  including  Chamber  of  Commerce \npublications distributed primarily in majority-white neighborhoods, and did not regularly appear \nin media or platforms accessible to or targeted at majority-Black and Hispanic areas. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 9 of 18    PageID 9\n \n \n37.  Trustmark  knew  that  its  focus  on  commercial  advertising  and  generic  brand \nmessaging was ineffective at generating mortgage loan applications from majority-Black and \nHispanic areas in the Memphis MSA during the Relevant Time Period.  \nTrustmark’s Inadequate Internal Fair-Lending Monitoring \n38.  During the Relevant Time Period, the Bank’s internal fair lending policies and \nprocedures were inadequate to ensure that the Bank was positioned to provide equal access to \ncredit to majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis MSA. \n39.  Trustmark did not establish internal governance and oversight committees to oversee \nfair-lending efforts or determine if the Bank was generating loans in majority-Black and Hispanic \nneighborhoods until August 2018. \n40.  Trustmark did not conduct a comprehensive internal fair-lending risk assessment \nuntil 2018. \n41.  Trustmark did not incorporate fair lending considerations in its branching decisions \nor in the development of new loan products and services until 2018. \nDisproportionately Low Numbers of Home Loan Applications from Majority-Black and \nHispanic Neighborhoods in the Memphis MSA \n \n42.  Trustmark’s acts and lending policies and practices, including those alleged in \nParagraphs 15 to 41, have discouraged applicants and prospective applicants in majority-Black \nand Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis MSA from applying for and obtaining home loans \nand other mortgage-related services.   \n43.  Trustmark’s own data on loan applications and originations that it is required to \nreport to regulators under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (“HMDA”), 12 U.S.C. \n§§ 2801–2811,  confirms  that  Trustmark  has  avoided  serving  majority-Black  and  Hispanic \nneighborhoods in the Memphis MSA.  See Exhibit B (depicting Trustmark’s applications from \nmajority-Black and Hispanic tracts in the Memphis MSA in 2014 and 2018). \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 10 of 18    PageID 10\n \n \n44.  During the Relevant Time Period, Trustmark Bank significantly underperformed its \n“peer lenders” in generating home mortgage loan applications from majority-Black and Hispanic \nareas in the Memphis MSA.  “Peer lenders” are similarly-situated financial institutions that \nreceived between 50 percent and 200 percent of the Bank’s annual volume of home mortgage loan \napplications. \n45.  The disparity between the rate of applications generated by Trustmark and the rate \ngenerated  by  its  peer  lenders  from  majority-Black  and  Hispanic  areas  is  both  statistically \nsignificant – meaning unlikely to be caused by chance – and sizable across the five-year Relevant \nTime Period. \n46.  During the Relevant Time Period, Trustmark received 3,064 HMDA-reportable \nmortgage loan applications within the Memphis MSA.  Of those applications, 10 percent came \nfrom individuals seeking credit for properties located in majority-Black and Hispanic census tracts.  \nBy contrast, during the same time period, Trustmark’s peers generated 24 percent of their 68,204 \ntotal applications from individuals seeking credit for properties located in these same majority-\nBlack and Hispanic census tracts. \n47.  In other words, Trustmark’s peers generated applications from individuals seeking \ncredit for properties located in majority-Black and Hispanic census tracts at almost 2.5 times the \nrate of Trustmark.  When disparities were calculated for individual years, Trustmark’s peers \ngenerated applications at a rate between 1.85 and 3.68 times the rate of Trustmark.  These \ndisparities are statistically significant – meaning, unlikely to have been produced by chance – \nacross the five-year Relevant Time Period and in every year analyzed. \n48.  The statistically significant disparities between applications Trustmark generated \nfrom majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods and those that its peers generated show that there \nwere individuals seeking credit for properties located in majority-Black and Hispanic areas in the \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 11 of 18    PageID 11\n \n \nMemphis  MSA.    Trustmark  had  no  legitimate,  non-discriminatory  reason  to  draw  so  few \napplications from these areas. \n49.  These figures show a statistically significant failure by Trustmark, relative to its peer \nlenders, to draw applications for home loans and provide residential mortgage services to residents \nof, and those seeking credit for properties located in, majority-Black and Hispanic census tracts in \nthe Memphis MSA on a non-discriminatory basis during the Relevant Time Period. \nDisproportionately Low Number of Mortgage Loans Made in Majority-Black and Hispanic \nNeighborhoods of the Memphis MSA \n \n50.  Trustmark’s acts and lending policies and practices, including those alleged in \nParagraphs 15 to 41, have discouraged applicants and prospective applicants in majority-Black \nand Hispanic neighborhoods from applying for and obtaining home loans and other mortgage-\nrelated services.  As a result, the Bank made a smaller percentage of HMDA-reportable residential \nmortgage loans in these neighborhoods compared to its peers from 2014 through 2018.  See Exhibit \nC  (depicting  Trustmark’s  loan  originations  from  majority-Black  and  Hispanic  tracts  in  the \nMemphis MSA in 2014 and 2018). \n51.  From 2014 to 2018, Trustmark made 2,369 HMDA-reportable residential mortgage \nloans in the Memphis MSA.  Of those loans, 8.3 percent were made to residents of majority-Black \nand Hispanic census tracts.  By contrast, Trustmark’s peers made 42,714 HMDA-reportable \nresidential mortgage loans in the same area, of which about 19 percent went to residents of \nmajority-Black and Hispanic census tracts – more than double the rate of Trustmark. \n52.  When disparities were calculated for individual years, Trustmark’s peers made loans \nat a rate between 1.65 and 3.35 times the rate of Trustmark.  The disparities are statistically \nsignificant across the five-year Relevant Time Period and for each individual year from 2014 to \n2018. \n53.  The statistically significant disparities between the number of home loans Trustmark \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 12 of 18    PageID 12\n \n \nmade from majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods and those that its peers made show that \nthere were individuals seeking and qualified for credit for properties located in majority-Black and \nHispanic areas in the Memphis MSA.  Trustmark had no legitimate, non-discriminatory reason to \nmake so few home loans from these areas. \n54.  These figures show a statistically significant failure by Trustmark, relative to its peer \nlenders, to make home loans and provide residential mortgage services to residents of, and those \nseeking credit for properties located in, majority-Black and Hispanic census tracts in the Memphis \nMSA on a non-discriminatory basis during the Relevant Time Period.. \nOCC’s Referral and the United States’ Investigation \n55.  In February 2018, Trustmark’s prudential regulator, the OCC, initiated a fair lending \nexamination of Trustmark focused on redlining. \n56.  After completing its examination and statistical analyses, the OCC determined that \nit had information suggesting that, between 2014 and 2016, Trustmark structured its mortgage \noperations in the Memphis MSA to avoid providing equal access to credit to residents seeking \nmortgage loans  in  majority-minority  areas  and  thereby  engaged  in  a pattern  or  practice  of \ndiscrimination in violation of the FHA. \n57.  By  correspondence  dated  April  6,  2020,  the  OCC  notified  the  United  States \nDepartment of Justice and the Bureau of this matter.  \n58.  On June 9, 2020, the United States notified Trustmark that it was opening an \ninvestigation into whether the Bank had engaged in unlawful redlining in violation of the FHA and \nECOA and requested documents related to Trustmark’s lending practices for the time period \nJanuary 1, 2014, to the present. \n59.  Trustmark’s  discriminatory  practices  as  described  herein  were  intended  to \ndiscriminate and have had the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, and national \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-02664   Document 1   Filed 10/22/21   Page 13 of 18    PageID 13\n \n \norigin. \nCOUNT I – VIOLATION OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT \n(By the United States of America) \n \n60.

Trustmark’s policies and practices constitute the unlawful redlining of majority-\nBlack and Hispanic communities in the Memphis MSA on account of the racial and national origin \ncomposition of those communities.  Trustmark’s policies and practices were intended to deny, and \nhad the effect of denying, equal access to home loans to residents of majority-Black and Hispanic \ncommunities and those seeking credit for properties located in those communities.  The Bank’s \nconduct was not justified by a business necessity or legitimate business considerations. \n62.  Trustmark’s actions as alleged herein constitute: \na.
