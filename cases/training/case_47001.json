    "summary": "<p>Filed on September 25, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, United States v. Scanlan is one of six coordinated enforcement actions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, against state election officials in California, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. The suits allege that the defendant states failed to maintain accurate statewide voter registration lists and refused to provide the Attorney General with the records necessary to assess compliance with federal law.</p>\r\n<p>The Department sued the State of New Hampshire and Secretary of State David M. Scanlan in his official capacity, alleging violations of Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 (CRA) and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). The complaint asserts that New Hampshire refused to provide an unredacted copy of its Statewide Voter Registration List (SVRL)&mdash;including voters&rsquo; names, addresses, birth dates, driver&rsquo;s license numbers, and the last four digits of Social Security numbers&mdash;despite multiple written demands from the Attorney General. The Department also contends that New Hampshire failed to regularly perform required voter list maintenance, citing unusually low removal rates for duplicate and ineligible registrations compared to national averages reported in the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS).</p>\r\n<p>After written requests on June 25 and August 18, 2025, New Hampshire declined to comply, citing state privacy laws. The Department argues that such laws are preempted by federal statutes, emphasizing that the state already shares similar data fields with the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC).</p>\r\n<p>The complaint brings two causes of action:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Civil Rights Act of 1960 (52 U.S.C. &sect; 20703): New Hampshire unlawfully refused to provide voter registration records demanded by the Attorney General.</li>\r\n<li>Help America Vote Act (52 U.S.C. &sect; 21083): The state failed to conduct adequate voter list maintenance and obstructed federal oversight.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The United States seeks declaratory and injunctive relief requiring New Hampshire to produce a complete electronic copy of its SVRL and to declare that any conflicting provisions of state law are preempted by federal law. No monetary damages or attorneys&rsquo; fees are sought.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On September 25, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division filed United States v. Scanlan in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire. The case is one of six lawsuits the Justice Department filed against California, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. Each lawsuit claims that the states are not keeping their voter registration lists accurate or sharing voter data required by federal law.\r\n\r\nThe Justice Department sued the State of New Hampshire and Secretary of State David M. Scanlan for refusing to give the federal government a complete copy of the state’s Statewide Voter Registration List (SVRL). The Department asked for voter names, addresses, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, and parts of Social Security numbers. New Hampshire said its privacy laws prevented full disclosure, even after several written requests in the summer of 2025.\r\n\r\nThe Justice Department says this violates the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002, and argues that federal law overrides state privacy rules. It asks the court to order New Hampshire to turn over the full voter list and related records.",
