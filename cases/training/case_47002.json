Schmidt is one of six coordinated lawsuits brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, against state election officials in Michigan, California, Texas, Florida, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. The suits allege that the states have failed to maintain accurate statewide voter registration lists and have refused to provide the Attorney General with records required under federal law.</p>\r\n<p>The Department sued the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt in his official capacity, alleging violations of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), and Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 (CRA). The complaint asserts that Pennsylvania has not adequately removed ineligible voters&mdash;such as deceased individuals or those who have moved&mdash;and has refused to provide the Attorney General with a complete electronic copy of its Statewide Voter Registration List (SVRL). The requested data includes each registrant&rsquo;s name, address, birth date, driver&rsquo;s license number, and the last four digits of their Social Security number.</p>\r\n<p>The Department sent multiple written requests between June and August 2025, which Pennsylvania declined, citing state privacy laws. The complaint argues that those laws are preempted by federal statutes, particularly given that Pennsylvania already shares identical data fields with the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a private consortium of states that maintains cross-state voter data.</p>\r\n<p>The United States brings three causes of action:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Civil Rights Act of 1960 (52 U.S.C. &sect; 20703): Failure to provide election-related records upon written demand.</li>\r\n<li>National Voter Registration Act (52 U.S.C. &sect; 20507(i)): Failure to disclose records related to voter list maintenance.</li>\r\n<li>Help America Vote Act (52 U.S.C. &sect; 21083): Failure to maintain accurate voter registration lists and to verify applicant information.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The government seeks declaratory and injunctive relief requiring Pennsylvania to provide a complete copy of its SVRL and to ensure future compliance with the NVRA, HAVA, and CRA. The complaint does not seek monetary damages or attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

The Department asked for voter names, addresses, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, and parts of Social Security numbers, as well as records showing how the state updates its lists. Pennsylvania said state privacy laws prevented full disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe Justice Department says this violates the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.

Reg. 14005 (Mar. 25, 2025).  Indeed, “[t]he right of American citizens \nto have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining \nthe rightful winner of an election.”  Id.  Under our Constitution, States “must safeguard American \nelections in compliance with Federal laws that protect Americans’ voting rights and guard against \ndilution  by  illegal  voting,  discrimination,  fraud,  and  other  forms  of  malfeasance  and \nerror.”  Id.  Without such safeguards, “[v]oter fraud drives honest citizens out of the democratic \nprocess and breeds distrust of our government.”  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006).  And \n“[v]oters  who  fear  their  legitimate  votes  will  be  outweighed  by  fraudulent  ones  will  feel \ndisenfranchised.”  Id.   \n To prevent fraudulent votes from being cast, federal law requires that States conduct \nroutine list maintenance procedures of their statewide voter registration databases.  Accurate voter \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 2 of 18\nrolls prevent the opportunity for fraud in federal elections.  The Civil Rights Division of the \nDepartment  of  Justice  is  tasked  with  ensuring  that  States  conduct  voter-registration-list \nmaintenance to prevent the inclusion of ineligible voters on any State’s voter registration list.  This \naction seeks to remedy Defendants’ violations of federal voting laws.  Plaintiff United States of \nAmerica (“United States”) brings this action against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Al \nSchmidt in his official capacity as the Secretary of State for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \nand alleges as follows:   \n1.  Defendants have failed to comply with the important mandates of the NVRA and \nHAVA by refusing to provide necessary information to enable the United States to assess its \ncompliance. One purpose of the NVRA is to “protect the integrity of the electoral process” and \n“ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(3)-\n(4). Consistent with these purposes, the NVRA requires each state to “conduct a general program \nthat makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of \neligible voters by reason of “the death of a registrant or a change in residence of the registrant.”  \n52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(4)(A)-(B).  \n2.  Similarly, HAVA requires the appropriate state or local election official to perform \nlist maintenance with respect to the centralized, computerized statewide voter registration list \nrequired under HAVA “on a regular basis[.]” 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(1)-(2). HAVA also requires \nthat states have “[a] system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable effort to remove registrants \nwho are ineligible to vote from the official list of eligible voters[,]” with “[s]afeguards to ensure \nthat eligible voters are not removed in error from the official list of eligible voters.” 52 U.S.C. \n§ 21083(a)(4)(A)-(B). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 3 of 18\n3.  The United States brings this action pursuant to its authority under the NVRA, the \nHAVA and the CRA to compel the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and its chief state election \nofficial,  Secretary of State Al Schmidt, to provide information regarding the State’s voter list \nmaintenance procedures and an electronic copy of the statewide voter registration list including all \nfields, to allow the Attorney General to effectively assess Defendants’ compliance with the \nrequirements of the NVRA and HAVA.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345, and \n2201(a); 52 U.S.C. §§ 20510(a) and 21111; and 52 U.S.C. § 20705. \n5.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant, to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the United States’ claims occurred in this \nDistrict, and the Defendants are located in and conduct election administration activities in this \nDistrict. \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff United States, through the Attorney General, has authority to enforce the \nNVRA, 52 U.S.C. § 20510(a), and Sections 21081 through 83, and 21083a of HAVA,  52 U.S.C. \n§ 21111. Both the NVRA and HAVA authorize the Attorney General to bring a civil action in an \nappropriate district court for such declaratory and injunctive relief as are necessary to carry out the \nrelevant requirements under the statute. 52 U.S.C. §§ 20510(a) and 21111.  Pursuant to the CRA, \n52 U.S.C. § 20705, the Attorney General may compel states to produce certain records and papers \nrelating to the administration of federal elections. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 4 of 18\n7.  Defendant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is a state of the United States of \nAmerica and, therefore, is subject to the requirements of the NVRA, the HAVA, and the CRA. 52 \nU.S.C. §§ 20502(4), 20503, 20701, and 21141. \n8.  Defendant Secretary of State Al Schmidt is sued in his official capacity as the chief \nstate  election  official  responsible  for  coordinating  Pennsylvania’s  responsibilities  under  the \nNVRA. See 52 U.S.C. § 20509; https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dos/about. Secretary Schmidt is sued \nin his official capacity only. \n    STATUTORY BACKGROUND \nA.  The Civil Rights Act of 1960  \n9.  Congress empowered the Attorney General to request records pursuant to Title III \nof the CRA, codified at 52 U.S.C. § 20701, et seq. \n10.  Section 301 of the CRA requires state and local officials to retain and preserve \nrecords related to voter registration and other acts requisite to voting for any federal office for a \nperiod of twenty-two months after any federal general, special or primary election. See 52 U.S.C. \n§ 20701. \n11.  Section 303 of the CRA provides, in pertinent part, “Any record or paper required \nby Section 20701 of this title to be retained and preserved shall, upon demand in writing by the \nAttorney General or his representative directed to the person having custody, possession, or control \nof such record or paper, be made available for inspection, reproduction, and copying at the \nprincipal office of such custodian by the Attorney General or his representative….” 52 U.S.C. § \n20703. \nB.  The National Voter Registration Act  \n12.  The NVRA was enacted “to establish procedures that will increase the number of \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 5 of 18\neligible citizens who register to vote in Federal elections “while ensur[ing] that accurate and \ncurrent voter registration rolls are maintained.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(1) and (4). \n13.  Section 8 of the NVRA establishes requirements for the administration of voter \nregistration for elections for federal office in covered states, including Pennsylvania. Section \n8(a)(4) requires each state to “conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove \nthe names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of “the death of \nthe registrant,” or “a change in the residence of the registrant, in accordance with subsections (b), \n(c), and (d)[.]” 52 U.S.C. §20507(a)(4)(A)-(B).  \n14.  Subsections (b), (c), and (d) set forth procedures for the removal of ineligible voters \nfrom official lists of voters as part of a state’s “program or activity to protect the integrity of the \nelectoral process by ensuring the maintenance of an accurate and current voter registration roll for \nelections for Federal office[.]” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b). \n15.  State voter list maintenance programs must be “uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in \ncompliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 [.]” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b)(1); see also S. Rep. No. \n103-6 at 31 (Feb. 25, 1993) (“The term ‘uniform’ is intended to mean that any purge program or \nactivity must be applied to an entire jurisdiction.”); accord H.R. Rep. No. 103-9 at 15 (Feb. 2, \n1993) (same). \n16.  Section 8(d) of the NVRA provides that a “[s]tate shall not remove the name of a \nregistrant from the official list of eligible voters in elections for Federal office on the ground that \nthe registrant has changed residence,” unless the registrant: \nA.  confirms in writing that the registrant has changed residence to a \nplace outside the registrar’s jurisdiction in which the registrant is registered; or  \nB.  has failed to respond to a [Confirmation Notice] . . . and has not \nvoted or appeared to vote . . . in an election during the period beginning on the date \nof the notice and ending on the day after the date of the second general election for \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 6 of 18\nFederal office that occurs after the date of the notice.                  \n52 U.S.C. § 20507(d)(1). \n \n17.  Section 8(d)(2) sets forth specific requirements for the Confirmation Notice to be \nsent to registrants, and Section 8(d)(3) provides that a “voting registrar shall correct an official list \nof eligible voters in elections for Federal office in accordance with change of residence information \nobtained in conformance with [subsection 8(d)].” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(d)(2)-(3). \n18.  Section 8 of the NVRA also provides an example of a voter list maintenance \nprogram that constitutes a reasonable effort to remove registrants who have become ineligible due \nto a change of residence. See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(c)(1). Under this program, a state uses information \nfrom the United States Postal Service National Change of Address (“NCOA”) program to identify \nregistrants who may have changed residence. See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(c)(1)(A). Where it appears \nfrom the NCOA information that a registrant has moved to a new address in the same jurisdiction, \nthe registration record is updated to show the new address, and the registrant is sent a notice of the \nchange by forwardable mail that includes a postage-prepaid, pre-addressed return form by which \nthe registrant may verify or correct the address information. See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(c)(1)(B)(i). \nWhere it appears from the NCOA information that a registrant has moved to a new address in a \ndifferent jurisdiction, the procedure set out in Section 8(d), described above, is used to confirm the \naddress change. See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(c)(1)(B)(ii). \n19.  Section 8(i) of the NVRA provides that: \n“Each State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall make available for public \ninspection and, where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all records \nconcerning  the  implementation  of  programs  and  activities  conducted  for  the \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters, \nexcept to the extent that such records relate to a declination to register to vote or to \nthe identity of a voter registration agency through which any particular voter is \nregistered.” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1).  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 7 of 18\n  Section 8(i)(2) further specifies: \n“The records maintained pursuant to paragraph (1) include lists of the names and \naddresses of all persons to whom notices described in subsection (d)(2) are sent, \nand information concerning whether or not each such person has responded to the \nnotice  as  of  the  date  that  inspection  of  the  records  is  made.”  52  U.S.C. \n§ 20507(i)(2). \n \n20.  Section 10 of the NVRA requires each state to “designate a State officer or \nemployee  as  the  chief  State  election  official  to  be  responsible  for  coordination  of  State \nresponsibilities” under the NVRA. 52 U.S.C. § 20509.  \nC.  The Help America Vote Act \n21.  The purpose of HAVA “can be stated very simply—it is to improve our country’s \nelection system.” H.R. Rep. 107-329(I) at 31 (2001). “Historically, elections in this country have \nbeen administered at the state and local level[,]” but Congress found that “the federal government \ncan play a valuable [role] by assisting state and local government in modernizing their election \nsystems.” Id. at 31-32. \n22.  HAVA imposes “minimum requirements” for the conduct of federal elections, \nwhich “allow the states to develop their own laws and procedures to fulfill the requirements” to \nthe extent that they are consistent with the standards set by HAVA. Id. at 35. \n23.  HAVA requires all states to  implement “in  a uniform  and nondiscriminatory \nmanner,  a  single,  uniform,  official,  centralized,  interactive  computerized  statewide  voter \nregistration list defined, maintained, and administered at the State level,” that contains “the name \nand registration information of every legally registered voter in the State and assigns a unique \nidentifier to each legally registered voter in the State.” 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(1)(A). \n24.  The computerized list required by HAVA “shall be coordinated with other agency \ndatabases within the State.” 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(1)(A)(iv). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 8 of 18\n25.  HAVA further establishes “[m]inimum standard[s] for accuracy of State voter \nregistration records.” 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(4). Section 303 provides that a state’s “election system \nshall include provisions to ensure that voter registration records in the State are accurate and are \nupdated regularly,” including by use of a “system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable \neffort to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote from the official list of eligible voters” and \n“safeguards to ensure that eligible voters are not removed in error from the official list of eligible \nvoters.” Id.  \n26.  HAVA mandates that a state may not process a voter-registration application \nwithout the applicant’s driver’s license number, where an applicant has a current and valid driver’s \nlicense, or, for other applicants, the last four digits of the applicant’s Social Security number.  See \n52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(5)(A)(i).  For applicants who have neither a driver’s license nor a social \nsecurity number, a state must assign a unique identifying number for voter registration purposes. \nSee 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(5)(A)(ii). A state must then determine the validity of the information \nprovided by the applicant.  See 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(5)(A)(iii). \n27.  HAVA applies to all fifty states, including Pennsylvania. See 52 U.S.C.  § 21141. \n28.  Section 303 of HAVA incorporates by reference certain provisions of the NVRA. \nSee 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(4)(A). These provisions, unless explicitly noted otherwise, apply to all \nstates covered under HAVA. Id.  \n29.  HAVA vests the Attorney General of the United States with sole authority to “bring \na civil action against any State or jurisdiction in an appropriate United States District Court for \nsuch declaratory and injunctive relief . . . as may be necessary to carry out the uniform and \nnondiscriminatory election technology and administration requirements under “Sections 21081, \n21082, 21083, and 21083a of [HAVA].” 52 U.S.C. § 21111.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 9 of 18\n30.  HAVA contains no private right of action. See 52 U.S.C. §§ 20901 to 21145. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n31.  The United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established by \nHAVA to serve as “a national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of information and \nreview of procedures with respect to the administration of Federal elections.”  EAC website, “Help \nAmerica Vote Act,” https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx. The EAC “is an \nindependent, bipartisan commission whose mission is to help election officials improve the \nadministration of elections and help Americans participate in the voting process.”  EAC website, \n“About the EAC,” (Sept. 22, 2025)https://www.eac.gov/about.  \n32.  The  EAC  conducts  a  biennial  Election  Administration  and  Voting  Survey \n(“EAVS”),  “an  analysis  of  state-by-state  data  that  covers  various  topics  related  to  the \nadministration of federal elections[,]” including voter registration and list maintenance.  Id.  The \nEAC’s most recent report, “Election Administration and Voting Survey 2024 Comprehensive \nReport: A Report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to the 119th Congress” (“2024 \nEAVS Report”), explains that as part of the 2024 EAVS, the states “reported data on their efforts \nto keep voter registration lists current and accurate, known as list maintenance[,]” such as the \nnumber  of  confirmation  notices  states  sent  “to  verify  continued  eligibility  from  registered \nvoters[,]” and the number of voter registration records that state removed from their voter lists.  \nEAC  (Sept.  15,  2025),  2024  EAVS  Report,  https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-\n07/2024_EAVS_Report_508.pdf, at 7. \n33.  The Attorney General sent a letter to Secretary Schmidt on June 23, 2025, seeking \ninformation regarding Pennsylvania’s compliance with HAVA. (“June 23 Letter”). The June 23 \nLetter requested, among other information and documents, a description of the process by which \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 10 of 18\nregistrants who are ineligible to vote due to non-citizenship are identified and removed from the \nstatewide voter registration list and descriptions of the processes that Pennsylvania uses to carry \nout its list maintenance obligations under Section 303 of HAVA, such as the process by which the \nstate identifies and removes any duplicate voter registrations and deceased registrants.   \n34.  The June 23 Letter also inquired about the requirement under Section 303(a)(5) of \nHAVA that applicants provide certain information and the state’s process for verifying that \ninformation.   \n35.  Secretary Schmidt responded in a July 23, 2025, letter to the Department of Justice.  \nThe response did not explain whether non-citizens were identified and what steps were taken to \nremove those voters.  The response also admitted that if the Commonwealth could not verify the \nID number provided as required by HAVA, the applicant would be registered to vote anyway. \n36.  A second letter from the Attorney General on August 4, 2025, requested that \nPennsylvania provide a list of election officials responsible for implementing Pennsylvania’s \ngeneral program of voter registration list maintenance from November 2022 through receipt of the \nletter and requested, pursuant to Section 8(i) of the NVRA, the current electronic copy of its \ncomputerized statewide voter registration list (“SVRL”), required under Section 303(a) of HAVA.  \nThe Department’s August 4 letter asked Pennsylvania to produce the requested information and \nrecords by encrypted email or via the Department’s secure file-sharing system, Justice Enterprise \nFile Sharing (JEFS).  \n37.  The Department’s August  4 letter also  requested information  about  duplicate \nregistrations, other EAVS survey questions, and  inquired about the removal procedures for \nineligible voters from  the voter rolls  because they were noncitizens,  felons,  or  adjudicated \nincompetent.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 11 of 18\n38.  In response, Secretary Schmidt sent a second letter on August 18, 2025, providing \nexplanations to the Attorney General’s EAVS requests.  In that letter, however, the Secretary \nstated, “Nothing in the NVRA provides a process by which those who are deemed non-eligible on \nthe basis of being a non-citizen are to be removed from the voter rolls.”  While acknowledging \nthat it is illegal for a non-citizen to misrepresent that he is a citizen on a voter registration \napplication, the Commonwealth does not appear to have any process in place to make any \ndetermination about whether there are non-citizens on the voter rolls.       \n39.  On August 14, 2025, the Attorney General sent a third letter to Secretary Schmidt, \nrequesting production of Pennsylvania’s SVRL that contains all fields.  The August 14, 2025, letter \nfrom  the  Justice  Department  requested  an  electronic  copy  of  Pennsylvania’s  computerized \nstatewide voter registration list, with all fields, including each registrant’s full name, date of birth, \nresidential address, their state driver’s license number, and the last four digits of their Social \nSecurity number as required by 52 U.S.C. § 20703. \n40.     Furthermore, the August 14 letter stated, “all data received from you will be kept \nsecurely and treated consistently with the Privacy Act.” \n41.  The information that the Justice Department collects pursuant to its request to \nPennsylvania will be maintained consistent with Privacy Act protections as explained on the \nJustice  Department’s  website  at  https://civilrights.justice.gov/privacy-\npolicy#:~:text=Our%20Statutes-\n,Privacy%20Act%20Statement,the%20scope%20of%20our%20jurisdiction.  The  full  list  of \nroutine uses for this collection of information can be found in the System of Records Notice \n(“SORN”) titled, JUSTICE/CRT – 001, “Central Civil Rights Division Index File and Associated \nRecords”, 68 Fed. Reg. 47610-01, 611 (Aug. 11, 2003); 70 Fed. Reg. 43904-01 (July 29, 2005); \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 12 of 18\nand 82 Fed. Reg. 24147-01 (May 25, 2017). It should be noted that the statutes cited for routine \nuse include the NVRA, HAVA, and the CRA. The records in the SORN are kept under the \nauthority of 44 U.S.C. § 3101 and in the ordinary course of fulfilling the responsibility assigned to \nthe Civil Rights Division under the provisions of 28 C.F.R. §§ 0.50, 0.51. \n42.  The August 14 letter also explained that HAVA specifies that the “last 4 digits of a \nsocial security number . . . shall not be considered to be a social security number for purposes of \nsection 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. [§] 552a note).”   52 U.S.C. § 21083(c).   The \nAugust 14 letter also stated: “In addition, any prohibition of disclosure of a motor vehicle record \ncontained in the Driver’s License Protection Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2721(b)(1), is exempted \nwhen the disclosure is for use by a government agency in carrying out the government agency’s \nfunction to accomplish its enforcement authority as the Justice Department is now doing.” \n43.  In response, Secretary Schmidt sent a letter on August 21, 2025 and offered public \nvoter records to the United States for review.  However, Pennsylvania’s public voter records do \nnot include the HAVA required unique identifiers requested by the Attorney General.  \n44.  Pennsylvania  is  a  member  of  the  Electronic  Registration  Information  Center \n(ERIC), an organization comprised of states whose stated mission “is to assist states in improving \nthe accuracy of America’s voter rolls and increasing access to voter registration for all eligible \ncitizens.”1  FAQ’s, ERIC, (Sept. 22, 2025) https://ericstates.org/faq/; see id., “Which States Are \nMembers of ERIC?” https://ericstates.org/about/.  ERIC is funded by its members, who pay a one-\ntime membership fee and annual dues. Id. ERIC’s website explains that “[a]t least every 60 days, \neach member submits their voter registration data and licensing and identification data from motor \nvehicle departments (MVD) to ERIC.” Id. ERIC’s website states: “Members submit dates of birth, \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 13 of 18\ndriver’s  license/ID  card  numbers,  and  Social  Security  numbers  to  ERIC  after  applying  a \ncryptographic one-way hash to these data points.” Id. \n45.  Pennsylvania provides the identical information that the Department has requested \nto ERIC, a private organization which lacks any enforcement authority, yet refuses to comply with \nfederal law and provide that same information to the Attorney General of the United States. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I:  CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1960, 52 U.S.C. § 20701, et seq. \n46.  The United States restates and incorporates herein the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs of the Complaint. \n47.  The CRA, 52 U.S.C. §§ 20701-20706, provides the United States authority to \nobtain the records and information requested in its June 23 Letter and its August 14 Letter. \n48.  The August 14, 2025, letter from the Justice Department requested an electronic \ncopy of Pennsylvania’s computerized statewide voter registration list, with all fields, including \neach registrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, their state driver’s license number, \nand the last four digits of their Social Security number as required by 52 U.S.C. § 20703. \n49.  In his August 21, 2025, letter Secretary Schmidt refused to provide the records \nrequested by the United States, including the SVRL and the requisite HAVA unique identifiers in \nviolation of the CRA. 52 U.S.C. §§ 20701-20706. \n50.  Defendants’ refusal to provide the information demanded by the Attorney General \nis a violation of the Civil Rights Act. See 52 U.S.C. §§ 20701-20706. \n51.  Unless and until ordered to do so by this Court, Defendants’ refusal to provide these \nrecords as requested constitutes a continuing violation of federal law. \n//  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 14 of 18\nCOUNT II:  NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i) \n52.  The United States restates and incorporates herein the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs of the Complaint. \n53.  The Attorney General requested an electronic copy of Pennsylvania’s statewide \nvoter registration list with all fields, including the HAVA-mandated unique identifiers, in letters \nfrom August 4 and August 14, pursuant to the NVRA’s disclosure requirement. \n54.  Defendants have failed to make available and to provide to the United States “all \nrecords concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of \nensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters . . . [,]” in violation of 52 \nU.S.C. § 20507(i)(1).   \n55.  This information is necessary for the Attorney General to determine if Pennsylvania \nis conducting “a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible \nvoters from the official lists of eligible voters,” as required by 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(4), including \nevaluating  issues  raised  by  the  data  and  by  answers  provided  by  the  Commonwealth  of \nPennsylvania to the Election Assistance Commission’s 2024 EAVS and reflected in the EAC’s \nJune 30, 2025 report. \n56.  Unless and until ordered to do so by this Court, Defendants’ refusal to provide these \nrecords as requested constitutes a continuing violation of federal law.   \nCOUNT III:  HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT, 52 U.S.C. § 21083 \n57.  The United States restates and incorporates herein the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs of the Complaint. \n58.  Defendants have failed to take the actions necessary for the State of Pennsylvania \nto comply with Section 303 of HAVA. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 15 of 18\n59.  Defendants’ failure to provide sufficient information in response to requests made \nby the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division prevent the Attorney General from evaluating \nPennsylvania’s compliance with HAVA, pursuant to the Attorney General’s statutory enforcement \nauthority under 52 U.S.C. § 21111. \n60.  Defendants’ refusal to provide sufficient information prevents the Attorney General \nfrom evaluating Pennsylvania’s procedures that “ensure[] . . . duplicate names are eliminated from \nthe computerized list.” 52 U.S.C. § 21083(a)(2)(B). \n61.  Defendants’ refusal to provide the United States the current electronic copy of \nPennsylvania’s computerized statewide voter registration list, containing all fields, including each \nregistrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, and either his state driver’s license number \nor  the  last  four  digits  of  the  Social  Security  number  prevents  the Attorney  General  from \ndetermining Pennsylvania’s compliance with the list maintenance requirements of HAVA. See 52 \nU.S.C. § 21083(a)(5)(A). \n62.  Unless and until ordered to do so by this Court, Defendants’ refusal to provide these \nrecords as requested constitutes a continuing violation of federal law.  \n  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the United States demands judgment in its favor and against Defendants as \nfollows: \nA.  Declare  that  Defendants’  refusal  to  provide  registration  records  and  Pennsylvania’s \nelectronic statewide voter registration list, with all fields, including each registrant’s full \nname, date of birth, residential address, and either their state driver’s license number, or \nthe last four digits of their Social Security number, upon a demand by the Attorney General \nviolates Title III of the CRA. 52 U.S.C. § 20703;  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-01481     Document 1     Filed 09/25/25     Page 16 of 18\nB.  Declare that Defendants have failed to make available and provide to the United States “all \nrecords concerning the implementation  of programs  and activities conducted for the \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters,” in \nviolation of the NVRA. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1); \nC.  Declare that the Defendants’ refusal to provide the requested records concerning voter \nregistration and list maintenance prevents the Attorney General from enforcing HAVA’s \nlist maintenance requirements; \nD.  Declare  that  any  State  law  that  prohibits  Defendants  from  providing  the  requested \nstatewide voter registration list is preempted by Federal law. \nE.  Order  Defendants  to  provide  to  the  United  States  the  current  electronic  copy  of \nPennsylvania’s computerized statewide voter registration list, with all fields, including \neach registrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, and either their state driver’s \nlicense number, or the last four digits of their Social Security number as required by the \nCRA, NVRA, and HAVA; and \nF.
