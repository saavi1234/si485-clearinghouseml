COE is a membership organization consisting of colleges and non-profits that participate in the federal TRIO program. The TRIO programs were established in the 1960s to help provide access to higher education for low-income families. In the summer of 2025, dozens of COE members received Notices of Non-Continuation from DOE, informing them that their TRIO grants would be discontinued by September 30, 2025. The DOE informed the grantees that their projects were not in \"the best interest of the Federal Government\" because these programs conflicted with the President's executive order \"prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education\" due to the program's grant applications using terms the Administration associates with DEI initiatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleges that the DOE's actions are unlawful because (1) DOE did not follow grant termination procedures under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; (2) DOE did not engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking in changing the selection/continuation criteria for these grants; (3) DOE's actions were arbitrary and capricious because the DOE did not explain it's reasoning for changing position from the preference priorities stated when the grantees applied for their grants; (4) DOE relied on impermissible factors in deciding to terminate the grants rather than evaluating the grantees' performance; (5) DOE's interpretation of the applicable regulations are unconstitutionally vague under the 5th Amendment; (6) DOE has violated Separation of Powers and the Take Care Clause by not spending funds appropriated by Congress for TRIO programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff sought declaratory relief and an injunction to set aside the Notices of Non-Continuation and to set the minimum award amount for their affected members at the funding level they received in 2024.</p>\r\n<p>This case remains ongoing.</p>",

In this iteration, the U.S. Department of Education has taken aim at \nthousands  of  low-income,  first-generation  college  students  and  60-year  old  grant  programs \ndesigned to help this group of students that are so frequently left behind. The Department elected \nnot to continue dozens of grants that were not scheduled to expire until 2026 or later, and it did so \nwithout regard for the law, Congress’s intent for the grant programs, the grantees’ settled reliance \ninterests, or the real-world consequences of ending their individual grant projects that are a lifeline \nof critical academic and support services to so many. These programs created a community, and a \nhallmark characteristic of their student participants is to pay it forward and help future generations. \nThe Department and the Secretary, however, have gone the other way and instead want to shut the \ndoor. COE brings this action on behalf of itself and its affected members to challenge the \nDepartment’s actions that are not only callous but also contrary to the statutes and regulations that \ngovern these programs.  \nAt issue are the federal TRIO programs. TRIO is an umbrella term encompassing eight \ngrant programs that Congress established beginning in the 1960s. All these programs are designed \nto help disadvantaged students pursue a postsecondary education. The Department is required to \ncarry  out  the  TRIO  programs  by  awarding  multiyear  grants  to  colleges  and  universities, \ncommunity-based agencies, and nonprofit organizations. Grant recipients in turn offer academic \ntutoring, counseling, and other critical support services to low-income, first-generation college \nstudents to help them progress through the academic pipeline and earn a college degree. By \nconsistently appropriating funds to TRIO for decades, including at least $1.19 billion in fiscal year \n2025, Congress has repeatedly affirmed the federal interest in seeing these students succeed.  \n  - 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 3 of 64\n \nCOE is the sole nonprofit membership organization in the United States for the TRIO \ncommunity. Its members include many postsecondary educational institutions and organizations \nthat just had one (or more) of their grants discontinued. These grants were discontinued for the \nsame fundamental reason: application of the Trump Administration’s new policies that are hostile \nto diversity, equity, and inclusion practices, whether such practices are real or perceived.  \nThese grants were all awarded by the Department during the Biden Administration after \nthe agency found that the grantees’ individual TRIO projects were meritorious and achieved \nCongress’s  goals.  Now  they  have  been  discontinued  because  they  advanced  the  “prior \nAdministration’s policies.” The Department’s letters to COE’s members who are the Affected \nPrograms (as defined below) pointed to language in grant applications they submitted years ago. \nBased on these statements, which federal law required to be in their applications, the Department \ndetermined that their projects violate “the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.” From that, \nin boilerplate letters delivered en masse to the Affected Programs, with no meaningful individual \nanalysis, the Department came to the sweeping conclusion that continuing the grants was “not in \nthe best interest of the Federal government.”  \nIt certainly is not uncommon for executive agencies to change their policies when a new \nPresident assumes office. This case does not challenge that basic principle. Yet an equally \nfundamental principle is that agencies must change their policies in the manner prescribed by law \nto avoid upsetting reliance interests. Here, federal law, unique to the Department, requires that it \nundergo notice-and-comment rulemaking to set new policies or “priorities” to use when making \ngrant decisions. The Department did not do that—instead it retroactively applied the current \nAdministration’s anti-DEI policies and standards, invoked new interpretations of civil rights laws \n  - 3 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 4 of 64\n \nto cancel dozens of grants, and relied on a “best interest of the Federal government” regulatory \nprovision that the Department’s current interpretation suggests gives it unfettered discretion.  \nThe Affected Programs—and all federal grant recipients—need some minimum level of \ncertainty. If executive agencies can determine what the “best interest” of the government is, it \nundermines recipients’ ability to plan and structure their grant projects in myriad ways. And it \nundermines Congress’s intent when Congress has affirmatively made those determinations, such \nas here—where it has expressed that intent over decades of legislation and appropriations for \nTRIO.  \nThe  federal  government  ultimately  consists  of  more  than  one  branch,  and  if  the \ngovernment’s “best interest” can be unilaterally defined by the Executive Branch without care for \nthe Legislative Branch, the Judicial Branch must step in.  At the moment, the Affected Programs’ \nTRIO projects are closing, staff and faculty are being laid off, and students are losing resources.  \nFor all these reasons, as detailed in this Complaint, the Department has violated numerous \nlaws and regulations. For immediate purposes and through separate motion, COE is requesting \nthat the Court enter a preliminary injunction to prevent further harm by vacating the Department’s \nNotices of Non-Continuation (as defined below) that were issued to the Affected Programs and by \ndirecting the Department to reconsider those decisions and take action by following the process \nrequired under law.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361, \n2201–02, and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06.  \n2.  In addition, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Title VI, which authorizes \n“judicial review” of federal agency action, including action “terminating or refusing to grant or to \n  - 4 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 5 of 64\n \ncontinue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any requirement imposed \npursuant to section 2000d–1 of this title” through the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d-2. \n3.  This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to Title IX, which generally mirrors Title \nVI and authorizes “judicial review” of agency action, including “terminating or refusing to grant \nor to continue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any requirement \nimposed pursuant to section 1682 of this title” through the APA. 20 U.S.C. § 1683. \n4.  This  Court  is  authorized  to  issue  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  under  the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, \nthe Court’s inherent equitable powers, and under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n5.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) \nbecause COE is a Washington D.C. nonprofit corporation, and its principal place of business is \nlocated  in  Washington,  D.C.  Venue  is  also  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  §§ 1391(b)(2)  and \n1391(e)(1)(A) because the Department is an agency of the United States and the Secretary is an \nofficer of the Department who is sued in her official capacity.  \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff  Council  for  Opportunity  in  Education  is  a  national  membership \norganization comprised of more than 1,000 colleges, universities, community-based agencies and \nnonprofit organizations within its 10 regional associations that participate in one or more of the \nfederal TRIO programs.  \n7.  A 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization  established in 1981, COE is  dedicated to \nfurthering the expansion of educational opportunities for low-income students, first-generation \n  - 5 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 6 of 64\n \ncollege students, students with disabilities, and veteran students who are served by the TRIO \nprograms. \n8.  Every year, TRIO serves nearly 1 million students across 3,400 separate TRIO \nprojects. These TRIO projects operate in all 50 states, plus Washington D.C., the Pacific Islands, \nand Puerto Rico.2 \n9.  COE provides numerous services to its members’ TRIO projects, and it works in \nconjunction with them to help disadvantaged students enter college, stay in college, and earn a \ndegree. The academic and future successes of these students is at the core of COE’s mission. \n10.  Among  other  things,  COE  offers  its  members  educational  programming, \ncounseling, technical assistance, and many other valuable services. COE also performs research \nthrough its Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Education that informs policymakers, \neducators, and the public on issues impacting educational opportunities and outcomes for low-\nincome, first-generation students, and students with disabilities.  \n11.  Dozens of COE’s members recently were notified by the Department that their \nTRIO  grants  were  being  discontinued  on  or  before  September  30,  2025  (the  “Affected \nPrograms”). These Affected Programs have been directly harmed by the Department’s non-\ncontinuation decisions (“Notice(s) of Non-Continuation”).  \n12.

Mid-20th century barriers for low-income Americans to enroll in postsecondary \neducation and early attempts to increase access  \n14.  In the last 125 years, Harry Truman is the only U.S. President who did not earn a \npostsecondary degree—whether from a trade school, community college, liberal arts university, or \nany other type of postsecondary educational institution.  \n15.  President  Truman’s  experience  led  him  to  believe  in  the  importance  of \npostsecondary education, and specifically, in every young person having the opportunity to attend \ncollege if they wished, regardless of their individual resources to finance higher education.  \n16.  In  1946,  President  Truman  formed  a  Presidential  Commission  on  Higher \nEducation. He charged the Commission, composed of civic and educational leaders, with “an \nexamination of the functions of higher education in our democracy and the means by which they \ncan best be performed.” Letter from President Truman, Appointing Members to the National \nCommission on Higher Education (July 13, 1946) (available in the Public Papers of Harry S. \nTruman). President Truman specifically directed the Commission to address “ways and means of \nexpanding educational opportunities for all able young people.” Id.  \n17.  The Truman Commission returned 18 months later with a comprehensive six-\nvolume report addressing all aspects of higher education in the United States. See The President’s \n  - 7 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 8 of 64\n \nCommission on Higher Education, Higher Education for American Democracy (Dec. 11, 1947);3 \nsee also Statement by the President Making Public a Report of the Commission on Higher \nEducation (Dec. 15, 1947).  \n18.  The Truman Commission examined then-existing economic barriers to college and \nconcluded “that the decision as to who shall go to college is at present influenced far too much by \neconomic considerations.” 2 The President’s Commission on Higher Education, Higher Education \nfor American Democracy, Equalizing and Expanding Individual Opportunity, at 16. The Truman \nCommission elaborated, stating:  \nThe old, comfortable idea that “any boy can get a college education who \nhas it in him” simply is not true. Low family income, together with the rising \ncosts of education, constitutes an almost impassable barrier to college \neducation for many young people. For some, in fact, the barrier is raised so \nearly in life that it prevents them from attending high school even when free \npublic high schools exist near their homes.  \nId. at 28. \n19.  The Truman Commission determined that along with state and local actors, the \nfederal government bore a responsibility to remedy the obstacles facing low-income students, and \nemphasized the equity arguments for improving college access, stating:  \nIt is the responsibility of the community, at the local, State, and National \nlevels, to guarantee that financial barriers do not prevent any able and \notherwise qualified young person from receiving the opportunity for higher \neducation.  There  must  be  developed  in  this  country  the  widespread \nrealization that money expended for education is the wisest and soundest of \ninvestments in the national interest. The democratic community cannot \ntolerate a society based upon education for the well-to-do alone. If college \nopportunities are restricted to those in the higher income brackets, the way \nis open to the creation and perpetuation of a class society which has no place \nin the American way of life.  \n \n3 Available  at  https://ia801506.us.archive.org/25/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.89917/2015.89917.Higher-Education-For-\nAmerican-Democracy-A-Report-Of-The-Presidents-Commission-On-Higher-Education-Vol-I---Vi_text.pdf. \n  - 8 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 9 of 64\n \nId. at 23. \n20.  In its recommendations to President Truman, the Commission therefore called for \nincreased  and  “immediate”  federal  spending  for  young,  low-income  students.  “Of  major \nimportance is the establishment of a national system of scholarships (or individual grants in-aid) \nand fellowships which will guarantee that a greatly increased number of qualified young persons \nhave a chance for full educational development.” Id. at 22. \n21.  The federal government’s efforts to eliminate these barriers did not come right \naway, however. In the decade after the Truman Commission produced its Report, the only major \nfederal education initiative providing financial assistance was the Serviceman’s Readjustment Act, \ncommonly known as the G.I. Bill. See Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 78-\n346, 58 Stat. 284. The G.I. Bill, while significant in its own right, was limited to benefitting \nmilitary veterans returning from World War II. See Tit. II, § 400, 58 Stat. at 287–88.  \n22.  Later, in response to the Soviet Union’s launching of the Sputnik satellite and \nconcerns that America was losing ground to the Soviets in the space race, President Dwight \nEisenhower in 1958 signed into law legislation to fund scholarships for students studying in \nscience and foreign languages, areas deemed critical to national defense. See National Defense \nEducation Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-864, 72 Stat. 1580. But this legislation had a similarly-\nlimited impact on the goals laid out by the Truman Commission, because aid benefitted students \nstudying only some disciplines, such as science, mathematics, engineering, or a modern foreign \nlanguage. See § 204, 72 Stat. at 1584. \n23.  The Truman Commission’s goals ultimately would not be realized in earnest until \nthe 1960s. \n  - 9 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 10 of 64\n \n24.  During  his  1964  State  of  the  Union  address,  President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson \n“declare[d] unconditional war on poverty in America.” Lyndon B. Johnson, State of the Union \nAddress (Jan. 8, 1964). Two months later, President Johnson outlined his terms of engagement:  \nI have called for a national war on poverty. Our objective: total victory. \nThere are millions of Americans—one fifth of our people—who have not \nshared in the abundance which has been granted to most of us, and on whom \nthe gates of opportunity have been closed. \nLyndon B. Johnson, Special Message to the Congress Proposing a Nationwide War on the Sources \nof Poverty (Mar. 16, 1964).  \n25.  At the time of President Johnson’s remarks, the United States had become a full-\nfledged superpower. But many Americans still remained in poverty. When Congress established \nthe first grant program under the TRIO umbrella—Upward Bound—it stated:  \nAlthough the economic well-being and prosperity of the United States have \nprogressed to a level surpassing any achieved in world history, and although \nthese benefits are widely shared throughout the Nation, poverty continues \nto be the lot of a substantial number of our people. The United States can \nachieve its full economic and social potential as a nation only if every \nindividual  has  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  the  full  extent  of  his \ncapabilities and to participate in the workings of our society. It is, therefore, \nthe policy of the United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the \nmidst of plenty in this Nation by opening to everyone the opportunity for \neducation and training, the opportunity to work, and the opportunity to live \nin  decency  and  dignity.  It  is  the  purpose  of  this  Act  to  strengthen, \nsupplement, and coordinate efforts in furtherance of that policy. \nEconomic Opportunity Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-452, Findings and Declaration of Purpose, § 2, \n78 Stat. 508, 508. \n26.  Along with the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act that created the Upward Bound \nprogram, under President Johnson’s leadership, several more laws in the 1960s established new \nfederal programs aimed at combatting poverty. See, e.g., Social Security Amendments of 1965, \n  - 10 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 11 of 64\n \nPub. L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (creating Medicare and Medicaid); see also The Food Stamp Act \nof 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-525, 78 Stat. 703.  \n27.  Among the era’s most consequential pieces of legislation was the landmark Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 (“HEA”).  \nb.  The Higher Education Act of 1965, the Education Amendments of 1968, and the \ncreation of TRIO programs  \n28.  Picking up where the Commission left off, Congress in the HEA created a broad \narray of federal financial loan and grant programs to assist students and their families with the cost \nof paying for a postsecondary education, as well as grant programs that provided funds directly to \npostsecondary institutions and others to fund projects that assist low-income students attend \ncollege. See Higher Education Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-329, 79 Stat. 1219.  \n29.  Since 1965, the HEA and its many component programs have been amended and \nextended several times, most recently in 2008. See Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, \nPub. L. No. 110-315, 122 Stat. 3078. \n30.  The HEA today is organized into eight titles. Most of the student financial aid \nprograms are authorized under Title IV, Student Assistance. See § 401(a), 79 Stat. at 1232–34. \n31.  Echoing the Commission’s views, Congress declared Title IV’s “purpose” as “to \nprovide, through institutions of higher education, educational opportunity grants to assist in \nmaking available benefits of higher education to qualified high school graduates of exceptional \nfinancial need, who for lack of financial means of their own or of their families would be unable \nto obtain such benefits without such aid.” § 401(a), 79 Stat. at 1232. \n32.  Specifically, in order “to assist in making available the benefits of postsecondary \neducation,” Part A of Title IV authorized “special programs and projects . . . designed . . . to \n  - 11 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 12 of 64\n \nprepare students from low-income families for postsecondary education.” 20 U.S.C. § 1070(a)(4); \nHigher Education Amendments of 1986, § 401(a), 100 Stat. 1268, 1308. \n33.  Part A took two approaches in this respect. One was the establishment of grant \nprograms that provided financial aid directly to low-income students to offset the costs of higher \neducation, such as the well-known Pell Grant program. See Education Amendments of 1972, Pub. \nL. No. 92-318, § 131, 86 Stat. 235, 247, amended by Education Amendments of 1980, Pub. L. \nNo. 96-374, § 402, 94 Stat. 1367, 1401 (renaming Basic Educational Opportunity Grants to Pell \nGrants), codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1070a – 1070a-2. \n34.  Part A’s other approach was to establish grant programs that provide funds to \neducational institutions and other entities to carry out projects offering support services to low-\nincome and other students in need.  \n35.  Among these grant programs are the TRIO programs. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1070a-11 \nto a-18.  \n36.  Following the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act’s creation of the Upward Bound \nprogram, Congress in the original HEA established a second program known as Talent Search. See \n§ 408, Contracts to Encourage Full Utilization of Educational Talent, 79 Stat. 1235–36.  \n37.  Three years later, Congress created a third program known as Student Support \nServices. See Education Amendments of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-575, § 105(a), 82 Stat. 1014, 1018 \n(creating Special Services for Disadvantaged Students); Higher Education Amendments of 1986, \nPub. L. No. 99-498, § 401(a), 100 Stat. 1268, 1339 (renaming Special Services for Disadvantaged \nStudents to Student Support Services).  \n  - 12 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 13 of 64\n \n38.  With the creation of Student Support Services, along with Upward Bound and \nTalent Search, these programs formed a “trio” of grant programs designed to foster increased \neducational opportunity and attainment.  \n39.  Since 1968, other programs have been established, providing a wider range of \nsupport services, all which fall under the “TRIO” umbrella today.  \n40.  The TRIO programs are all authorized under Title IV, Part A, subpart 2 of the HEA, \nand codified at 20 U.S.C. § 1070a. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1070a-11 (TRIO program authority); 1070a-\n12 (Talent Search); 1070a-13 (Upward Bound, including Veterans Upward Bound and Upward \nBound Math and Science); 1070a-14 (Student Support Services); 1070a-15 (Ronald E. McNair \nPostbaccalaureate Achievement Program); 1070a-16 (Educational Opportunity Centers); 1070a-\n17 (Staff Training). \n41.  The Department is statutorily required to carry out the TRIO programs. Congress \ndirected that:  \nThe Secretary shall . . . carry out a program of making grants and contracts \ndesigned to identify qualified individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, \nto prepare them for a program of postsecondary education, to provide \nsupport  services  for  such  students  who  are  pursuing  programs  of \npostsecondary education, to motivate and prepare students for doctoral \nprograms,  and  to  train  individuals  serving  or  preparing  for  service  in \nprograms and projects so designed. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(a); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1070(b) (“The Secretary shall, in accordance with \nsubparts 1 through 9 of this part, carry out programs to achieve the purposes of this part.”). \n42.  Today, the national network of TRIO programs is the largest federal infrastructure \nserving  the  expansion  of  college  opportunities  for  the  low-income,  first-generation  student \npopulation.  \n  - 13 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 14 of 64\n \n43.  Approximately  3,400  TRIO  projects,  located  at  more  than  1,000  colleges, \nuniversities, community-based agencies and nonprofit organizations across all 50 states, plus \nWashington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Islands, operate today. See, e.g., Department of \nEducation, TRIO Footprint in 2023-24.4 These projects collectively serve around 900,000 students \nevery year. See, e.g., Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Request, at 85 (“FY 2026 \nBudget Request”).5  \n44.  The TRIO programs work. TRIO participants consistently achieve higher rates of \nhigh school graduation, college enrollment, retention, and degree attainment compared to peers \nfrom similar backgrounds who do not receive TRIO services.6  \n45.  Hundreds of thousands of students have benefitted from them. Jose Hernandez \ngrew from a migrant farmworker to a U.S. astronaut with the help of a TRIO program. Tara Ruttley \nbegan her career at NASA and then became Chief Scientist for Orbital Reef, a low Earth orbit \nspace station under development, after participating in a TRIO program. Gwen Moore became the \nfirst African American elected to Congress from Wisconsin after participating in a TRIO program. \nAcademy-award winning actress Viola Davis participated in a TRIO program. John Quinones \ngrew from a migrant farmworker to ABC News host and journalist also with the help of TRIO’s \nUpward Bound program.  \n \n4 Available at https://ope.ed.gov/programs/mapED/storymaps/trio/. \n5 Available at https://ed.gov/media/document/fy-2026-congressional-justification-higher-education-110154.pdf.  \n6 Adam K.

Good  Morning  America  recently  highlighted  the  TRIO  programs  and  their \nsuccesses. See Future of Federal Trio Programs at Risk, ABC News.7 As stated in that video, a \nTRIO program is “not a handout. It’s a hand up.”  \nc.  Congressional funding for TRIO  \n47.  Congress has funded TRIO programs via annual appropriations acts since 2015.8 \n48.  Annual  appropriations  acts  specify  the  dollar  amount  appropriated  to  the \nDepartment for carrying out the programs it administers. Congress appropriates funds to the \nDepartment at an “account level” to fund individual programs authorized under each title of the \nHEA.  \n49.  Relevant here, Congress appropriates funding to the Department to carry out the \nTRIO programs under the “Higher Education” account.  \n50.  For fiscal year 2024, Congress appropriated $3.28 billion to the Department “[f]or \ncarrying out, to the extent not otherwise provided, titles II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII of the HEA, \nthe Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, and section 117 of the Perkins Act \n. . . .” Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub.

Of that amount, Congress allocated at least $1.19 billion to the Department for \ncarrying  out  the  federal  TRIO  programs.  See  Explanatory  Statement  Regarding  Further \nConsolidated Appropriations  Act,  2024,  170 Cong. Rec.  H2057 (Higher Education account \nspending table); H1886 (noting that Explanatory Statement reflects intent of Congress).9 \n52.  For  fiscal  year  2025,  Congress  level  funded  TRIO  programs  through  three \ncontinuing resolutions (“CR”).  \n53.  A CR is a temporary measure that Congress uses to fund the federal government \nwhen regular appropriations bills are not passed by the start of the fiscal year to avoid a government \nshutdown and provide temporary funding for government operations. CRs typically provide \nappropriations at an amount based on the previous fiscal year’s appropriations acts and for the \nsame purposes as those provided in the previous fiscal year. \n54.  Relevant here is a CR passed in March 2025 that continued funding through the \nremainder of fiscal year 2025 at the previous year’s level for most programs. See Full-Year \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, 139 Stat. 9 (“2025 \nCR”).10 \n55.  The 2025 CR appropriated to the Department for fiscal year 2025 “[s]uch amounts \nas may be necessary, at the level specified . . . in applicable appropriations Acts for fiscal year \n2024.” See § 1101(a), 139 Stat. at 10–11.11 The applicable fiscal year 2025 appropriations act for \nthe Department is the 2024 Appropriations Act. See § 1101(a)(8), 139 Stat. at 11. \n \n9 Available at https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2024/03/22/170/51/CREC-2024-03-22-bk2.pdf. \n10 On September 30, 2024, a first CR was passed by Congress to provide temporary funding for government operations \nthrough December 20, 2024. See H.R. 9747, Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025. A second CR was \nenacted in December 2024 to extend government funding through March 14, 2025. See H.R. 10545, American Relief \nAct, 2025.  \n11 The 2025 CR slightly reduced fiscal year 2025 funding for the Higher Education account by $202 million, without \naffecting funding specifically for the TRIO programs. See § 1908(6), 139 Stat. at 32–33 (“Notwithstanding section \n  - 16 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 17 of 64\n \n56.  The 2025 CR appropriated funds “under the authority and conditions provided in” \nthe 2024 Appropriations Act. See § 1101(a), 139 Stat. at 10–11.  \n57.  The 2025 CR further stated that “appropriations and funds made available and \nauthority granted pursuant to this division shall be available through September 30, 2025.” § 1106, \n139 Stat. at 12.12 \nd.  The TRIO programs  \n58.  As discussed, there are eight TRIO programs: Upward Bound (“UB”), Upward \nBound Math-Science (“UBMS”), Veterans Upward Bound (“VUB”), Educational Opportunity \nCenters (“EOC”), Talent Search (“TS”), Student Support Services (“SSS”), Ronald E. McNair \nPostbaccalaureate Achievement (“McNair”), and Training Program for Federal TRIO Programs \nStaff (“Staff Training”). All eight TRIO programs are at issue in this case.13  \n \n1101 of this Act, the level for the following accounts shall be applied as follows: . . . [u]nder the heading ‘Department \nof Education—Higher Education’, by substituting ‘$3,080,952,000’ for ‘$3,283,296,000.’”).  \n12 Both Senate and House Committees on Appropriation have recently proposed to continue funding TRIO programs \nin fiscal year 2026.  On July 31,  2025, the Senate Appropriations Committee by a 26-3 vote advanced the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies’ draft fiscal \nyear 2026 spending bill and allocated $3,267,926,000 to the “Higher Education” budget account. See S. 2587, 119th \nCong. at 162–64 (2025). The Senate Committee Report directs the Department to allocate $380,816,000 to SSS. See \nS. Rept. 119-55, at 306. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole expressly stated that the bill “maintains \nfunding for important education programs, such as TRIO and GEAR UP and Pell Grants.” Tom Cole Remarks at \nFY26 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Bill Subcommittee Markup (Sept. 2, \n2025),  available  at  https://appropriations.house.gov/news/remarks/cole-remarks-fy26-labor-health-and-human-\nservices-education-and-related-agencies-bill;  see  also  Subcommittee  Print,  Making  appropriations  for  the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2026, and for other purposes, 119th Cong. at 142–44 (2025) (allocating $2,714,241,000 to the “Higher \nEducation” budget account).  \n13 Also on September 30, 2025, COE filed a separate lawsuit against the Department (and its Secretary) challenging \nthe Department’s denials of its members’ applications who applied for a new SSS grant in 2024 and that the \nDepartment denied in 2025. See COE v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., et al., No. 1:25-cv-03491-TSC (D.D.C.) (compl. filed \nSept. 30, 2025). Unlike the other TRIO grants, SSS grants were in “competition” in 2025. Although this case and the \nSSS-specific case are factually related in many ways, COE has filed them separately because the statutory and \nregulatory scheme governing denials of applications for new grants and the discontinuation of grants is distinct. \nNevertheless, upon information and belief, the Department discontinued a very small number of SSS grants of \nAffected Programs that were on a different 5-year cycle than most SSS grant recipients.  \n  - 17 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 18 of 64\n \n59.  Each  TRIO  program  serves  a  different  demographic.  UB  serves  high  school \nstudents,  providing  intensive  preparation  services  and  encouragement  to  help  them  pursue \npostsecondary education. See 34 C.F.R. § 645.10(a). UBMS is targeted at helping those high \nschool students who seek to pursue postsecondary programs leading to careers in the math and \nscience fields students. See 34 C.F.R. § 645.10(b). VUB provides services to assist military \nveterans prepare for postsecondary education. See 34 C.F.R. § 645.10(c). TS primarily serves \nstudents and out-of-school youth to support high school completion and postsecondary enrollment. \nSee 34 C.F.R. § 643.3. EOC primarily serves adults over the age 19 in pursuing postsecondary \neducation. See 34 C.F.R. § 644.3. SSS aims to motivate undergraduate students to complete their \nundergraduate education. See 34 C.F.R. § 646.3. McNair prepares undergraduate students for \ngraduate school. See 34 C.F.R. § 647.3. Finally, Staff Training provides training to TRIO project \nstaff to be more effective. See 34 C.F.R. § 642.3. \n60.  There are other differences between the individual TRIO programs, but except \nwhere discussed herein, they are not particularly relevant.  \nII.  The process for awarding TRIO grants and issuing continuation awards \n61.  The grant application and award process for TRIO grants is outlined in the TRIO \nauthorizing statute, see 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11, and the statutes specific to each TRIO program, see \n§§ 1070a-12  to  17.    They  are  implemented  by  the  Department’s  TRIO  program-specific \nregulations, in addition to the Department’s discretionary grantmaking regulations.  \na.  Notices inviting applications for new grants  \n62.  The process begins when the Department announces a grant “competition” and \nissues a notice of invitation to apply for a new TRIO grant, which is published in the Federal \nRegister. See 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(1)–(2).  \n  - 18 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 19 of 64\n \n63.  Among other things, the notices tell prospective applicants how the Department \nwill evaluate, score, and select applicants for new TRIO grants. More specifically, the notices \ndescribe the “selection criteria” and the “priorities” that it will use for the competition.  \n64.  The selection criteria contained within a notice are based on the TRIO program-\nspecific statute, the program-specific regulations, and on the Department regulations found at 34 \nC.F.R. § 75.210. \n65.   The “priorities” in a notice may include those that the Department previously \nestablished through notice-and-comment rulemaking. See 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2). \n66.  Although the APA generally exempts grant-related rules from public notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking requirements, the General Education Provisions Act (“GEPA”) carves out \nfrom that exemption for rules by the Department that establish priorities applicable to discretionary \ngrant programs, including the TRIO programs. See 20 U.S.C. § 1232.  \n67.  Once the priorities are proposed and public comment is received, the Department \nthen publishes the final priorities in the Federal Register. The Department may then incorporate \nthese priorities in a notice of invitation to apply for a TRIO grant.  \n68.  The priorities may be designated as invitational, “competitive preference,” or \n“absolute preference” priorities. 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(c)(1)–(3). \n69.  The effect of each type of priority is as follows: \na.  Absolute-preference  priority:  Under  an  absolute-preference  priority,  the \nDepartment  considers  only  applications  that  meet  the  priority.  34  C.F.R. \n§ 75.105(c)(3).  \n \nb.  Competitiv- preference priority: Under a competitive-preference priority, the \nDepartment gives competitive preference to an application by (1) awarding \nadditional points, depending on the extent to which the application meets the \npriority, see 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(c)(2)(i); or (2) selecting an application that \nmeets the priority over an application of comparable merit that does not meet \nthe priority, see 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(c)(2)(ii). \n  - 19 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 20 of 64\n \n \nc.  Invitational  priority:  Under  an  invitational  priority,  the  Department  is \nparticularly interested in applications that meet the priority. However, the \nDepartment does not give an application that meets the priority a preference \nover other applications. See 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(c)(1).  \n \n70.  The  notice  states  the  maximum  number  of  points  that  may  be  awarded  to \napplications that successfully address each selection criterion and each priority.  \n71.  GEPA also requires TRIO grant applicants to describe the steps they propose to \ntake to ensure equity in their projects, including by addressing the special needs of students to \novercome barriers to equitable participation, including barriers based on gender, race, color, and \nother characteristics. 20 U.S.C. § 1228a(b) (“GEPA Equity Directive”).  \n72.  Upon issuing the notice of invitation and receiving applications, the Secretary \nrecruits and relies on a panel of “peer reviewers” to evaluate applications against its selection \ncriteria and priorities. See 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(c)(4); 34 C.F.R. § 75.200; 34 C.F.R. § 217. \n73.  Peer reviewers are individuals from outside the federal government that have \nexpertise in the subject area of the TRIO program at issue. 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(c)(4); see \nDepartment of Education, Discretionary Grantmaking at ED 25–26.14  \n74.  Each peer reviewer scores an application, and the Department averages all the \nscores given. 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(c)(3). The Department then adjusts the average score to \naccount for the applicants’ prior experience in carrying out the same type of TRIO grant project \nfor which they are applying during the three fiscal years designated in the notice.  \n75.  The Department then ranks the applications in the order of their scores.  The \nDepartment “shall award grants and contracts under this division in the order of the scores received \n \n14  Available  at  https://www.ed.gov/media/document/grantmaking-ed-108713.pdf  (hereinafter,  “Discretionary \nGrantmaking”).  \n  - 20 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 21 of 64\n \nby the application for such grant or contract in the peer review process . . . and adjusted for prior \nexperience.” 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(c)(3); see Discretionary Grantmaking, supra ¶ 73, at 27 (“[ED] \nuses the scores determined by non-Federal reviewers to make funding determinations.”). \nb.  Awarding a new grant  \n76.  The Department notifies applicants if their application has been evaluated and \nselected for funding, and if so, the Department issues the successful applicant a grant award \nnotification (“GAN”).  \n77.  “The  grant  obligates  both  the  Federal  Government  and  the  grantee  to  the \nrequirements that apply to the grant.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.236.  \n78.  By statute, UB, UBMS, VUB, TS, EOC, SSS and McNair grants “shall be awarded \nfor a period of 5 years.” 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(b)(2)(A). Staff Training grants “shall be awarded \nfor a period of 2 years.” 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(b)(2)(B).  \nc.  Issuing a continuation award  \n79.  Although TRIO grants are awarded for either two-year (Staff Training) or five-year \n(UB, UBMS, VUB, TS, EOC, SSS and McNair) periods, funds are obligated and disbursed by the \nDepartment to grant recipients in individual 12-month “budget periods.” \n80.  When the Department awards a multiyear grant, it “approves a budget period of not \nmore than 12 months, even if the project has a multi-year project period.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.251(a).  \n81.  “If the Secretary approves a multi-year project period, the Secretary: (1) Makes a \ngrant to the project for the initial budget period; and (2) Indicates his or her intention to make \ncontinuation awards to fund the remainder of the project period.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.251(b). \n82.  To obtain a “continuation award” for each budget period after the first, recipients \nmust satisfy applicable statutes and regulations incorporated into the grant. 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a). \n  - 21 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 22 of 64\n \n83.  Unlike when applying for a new grant, however “[a] grantee does not have to \ncompete with other applicants to receive” a continuation award. See Discretionary Grantmaking, \nsupra ¶ 73, at 50. \n84.  Specifically, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a), which governs continuation awards, states: \nA grantee, in order to receive a continuation award from the Secretary for a \nbudget period after the first budget period of an approved multiyear project, \nmust— \n(1) Either— \n(i) Demonstrate that it has made substantial progress in achieving— \n(A) The goals and objectives of the project; and \n(B) The performance targets in the grantee’s approved application, \nif the Secretary established performance measurement requirements \nfor the grant in the application notice; or \n(ii) Obtain the Secretary’s approval for changes to the project that— \n(A) Do not increase the amount of funds obligated to the project by \nthe Secretary; and \n(B) Enable the grantee to achieve the goals and objectives of the \nproject and meet the performance targets of the project, if any, \nwithout changing the scope or objectives of the project; \n(2) Submit all reports as required by § 75.118; \n(3) Continue to meet all applicable eligibility requirements of the grant \nprogram; \n(4) Maintain financial and administrative management systems that meet \nthe requirements in 2 CFR 200.302 and 200.303; and \n(5) Receive a determination from the Secretary that continuation of the \nproject is in the best interest of the Federal Government. \n34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a).15 \n85.  Under  34  C.F.R.  § 75.253(f),  “[t]he  Secretary  may  decide  not  to  make  a \ncontinuation award if . . . (1) A grantee fails to meet any of the requirements in paragraph (a) of \n \n15 An earlier version of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a) had the “best interest of the Federal Government” requirement in \n§ 75.253(a)(4) and stated that “The Secretary may make a continuation award for a budget period after the first budget \nperiod of an approved multi-year project if . . . [c]ontinuation of the project is in the best interest of the Federal \nGovernment.” \n  - 22 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 23 of 64\n \nthis section; or (2) A grantee fails to ensure that data submitted to the Department as a condition \nof the grant meets the definition of ‘quality data’ in 34 C.F.R. § 77.1(c) and does not have a plan \nacceptable to the Secretary for addressing data-quality issues in the next budget period.” \n86.  “In  determining  whether  the  grantee  has  met  the  requirements  described  in \nparagraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may consider any relevant information regarding \ngrantee performance. This includes considering reports required by § 75.118[16], performance \nmeasures established under § 75.110, financial information required by 2 CFR part 200, and any \nother relevant information.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(b). \n87.  Nothing in the regulations, however, contemplates that the Department will review \na grantee’s application to determine whether to issue a continuation award.  \n88.  The Department, prior to 2025, rarely did not issue continuation awards. See \nEducation Department General Administrative Regulations and Related Regulatory Provisions, 89 \nFed. Reg. 70,300, at 70,316 (Aug. 29, 2024) (“In general, we do not deny a large number of non-\ncompeting continuation awards and, if that does happen, grantees are often aware of the likelihood \nof the decision well in advance”); Direct Grant Programs; Final Rule, 59 Fed. Reg. 30,258, at \n30,259 (June 10, 1994) (a cut-off in continuation award funding is “extremely rare in practice”). \n89.  The Department must inform current recipients of “the status of their application \nfor continued funding at least 8 months prior to the expiration of” their grant. 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-\n11(7). \n \n16 Recipients specifically must submit financial and performance reports, which are generally in the form of an Annual \nPerformance Report (“APR”), to the Department following the end of the prior budget period that details their project \nactivities, participants, and spending during that budget period. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 75.118, 75.720. \n  - 23 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 24 of 64\n \n90.  “If the Secretary makes a continuation award under this section—(1) The Secretary \nmakes the award under §§ 75.231 through 75.236; and (2) The new budget period begins on the \nday after the previous budget period ends.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(d).  \n91.  If the Secretary “decides not to make a continuation award . . . the Secretary will \nnotify the grantee of that decision, the grounds on which it is based, and, consistent with 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.342, provide the grantee with an opportunity to request reconsideration of the decision.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 75.253(g). There is no established deadline for the Department to act on requests for \nreconsideration.  \nd.  The requirement for grant recipients to comply with federal civil rights law. \n92.  Per the Department’s regulations, a recipient of grant funds must comply with Title \nVI, Title IX, and other civil rights laws. See 34 C.F.R. § 75.500(a).17 \n93.  Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in \nany program receiving federal financial assistance. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. Further, Title VI \nauthorizes and directs “[e]ach Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend \nFederal financial assistance to any program or activity, by way of grant . . . to effectuate the \nprovisions of section 2000d of this title with respect to such program or activity by issuing rules, \nregulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the \nobjectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is \ntaken.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n94.  In addition to requiring compliance by programs receiving federal funding, Title \nVI requires an agency administering federal funds to follow specific steps to enforce compliance.  \n \n17 Such laws include Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) and the Age Discrimination Act \nof 1975 (the “ADEA”). See 42 U.S.C. § 6102; 29 U.S.C. § 794a.  \n  - 24 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 25 of 64\n \n95.  Specifically, Title VI provides that no action refusing to grant federal financial \nassistance “shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate \nperson  or  persons  of  the  failure  to  comply  with  the  requirement  and  has  determined  that \ncompliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n96.  If an agency cannot secure voluntary compliance with Title VI, it may terminate \nfunding.  But  refusing  to  provide  funding  requires  “an  express  finding  on  the  record,  after \nopportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n97.  “[S]uch termination or refusal shall be limited to the particular political entity, or \npart thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in \nits effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so \nfound, or (2) by any other means authorized by law.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n98.  Once the agency has terminated financial assistance, the head of the agency “shall \nfile with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program \nor activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.” \nAny department action terminating financial assistance does not “become effective until thirty \ndays have elapsed after the filing of such report.” Id.  \n99.  Title IX prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681. Title IX’s \nprocedural requirements and enforcement mechanisms mirror those of Title VI and also require an \nagency to first seek voluntary compliance before terminating funding. See 20 U.S.C. § 1682.18 \n \n18 Section 504 “incorporate[es] the enforcement mechanisms available under Title VI.” Alexander v. Choate, 496 U.S. \n287, 306 n.27 (1985). The ADEA, too, requires a department or agency to seek voluntary compliance and determine \nthat compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means before terminating funding. See 42 U.S.C. § 6104(c) (“No \naction may be taken under subsection (a) until the head of the Federal department or agency involved has advised the \nappropriate person of the failure to comply with the regulation involved and has determined that compliance cannot \nbe secured by voluntary means.”).  \n  - 25 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 26 of 64\n \nIII.  Between 2021 and 2024, the Affected Programs met grant requirements and the \nDepartment awarded TRIO grants.  \na.  In 2021, the Department published final priorities that included competitive \npreference priorities that relied on commonly used DEI terms. \n100.  In accordance with 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d) and 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b), the Department \nin June 2021 issued proposed supplemental priorities and definitions for discretionary grants \nprograms. See Proposed Priorities and Definitions, 86 Fed. Reg. 34,664 (June 30, 2021). The \nDepartment issued its final supplemental priorities and definitions for discretionary grant programs \nin December 2021. See Final Priorities and Definitions, 86 Fed. Reg. 70,612 (Dec. 10, 2021) \n(“2021 Final Priorities”). \n101.  The 2021 Final Priorities listed six final priorities: (1) Addressing the Impact of \nCOVID-19 on Students, Educators, and Faculty; (2) Promoting Equity in Student Access to \nEducational Resources and Opportunities; (3) Supporting a Diverse Educator Workforce and \nProfessional Growth To Strengthen Student Learning; (4) Meeting Student Social, Emotional, and \nAcademic Needs; (5) Increasing Postsecondary Education Access, Affordability, Completion, and \nPost-Enrollment Success; and (6) Strengthening Cross-Agency Coordination and Community \nEngagement To Advance Systemic Change. See 2021 Final Priorities, 86 Fed. Reg. at 70,635–\n70,639. \n102.  The six final priorities refer to “underserved students”, and the 2021 Final Priorities \ndefined “underserved student” to include “[a] student of color” and “[a] lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, queer or questioning, or intersex (LGBTQI+) student.” 2021 Final Priorities, 86 Fed. \nReg. at 70,639–70,640. \n  - 26 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 27 of 64\n \nb.  In 2023, the Department revised the GEPA Equity Directive to address four \nquestions involving “equity.” \n103.  As noted earlier, GEPA requires that grant applicants describe the steps they \npropose to take to ensure equity in their projects, including by addressing the special needs of \nstudents to overcome barriers to equitable participation, including barriers based on gender, race, \ncolor, and other characteristics.  \n104.  20  U.S.C. § 1228a,  titled  “Equity  for  students,  teachers,  and  other  program \nbeneficiaries,” states: \nThe Secretary shall require each applicant for assistance under an applicable \nprogram  (other  than  an  individual)  to  develop  and  describe  in  such \napplicant’s application the steps such applicant proposes to take to ensure \nequitable access to, and equitable participation in, the project or activity to \nbe conducted with such assistance, by addressing the special needs of \nstudents, teachers, and other program beneficiaries in order to overcome \nbarriers to equitable participation, including barriers based on gender, race, \ncolor, national origin, disability, and age. \n20 U.S.C. § 1228a(b). \n105.  In 2022, in response to President Biden’s January 25, 2021 Executive Order 13985, \nAdvancing  Racial  Equity  and  Support  for  Underserved  Communities  Through  the  Federal \nGovernment, the Department proposed changing this form to its current four question format. See \nAgency Information Collection Activities; Comment Request; GEPA Section 427 Guidance for \nAll Grant Applications, 87 Fed. Reg. 47,733 (Aug. 4, 2022) (“In response to the Agency’s Equity \nPlan resulting from the President’s Executive Order 13985, we now propose to update that form \nby expanding the number of questions from one to four.”). \n106.  The current GEPA Equity Directive form asks: (1) “Describe how your entity’s \nexisting mission, policies, or commitments ensure equitable access to, and equitable participation \nin, the proposed project or activity”; (2) “Based on your proposed project or activity, what barriers \n  - 27 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 28 of 64\n \nmay impede equitable access and participation of students, educators, or other beneficiaries?” (3) \n“Based on the barriers identified, what steps will you take to address such barriers to equitable \naccess and participation in the proposed project or activity?” and (4) “What is your timeline, \nincluding targeted milestones, for addressing these identified barriers?” ED, GEPA Section 427 \nForm.19 \nc.  The Department incorporates the 2021 Final Priorities as part of TRIO grant \ncompetitions. \n107.  Between 2020 and 2024, the Department issued notices inviting applications for \nnew two-year or five-year grants for TRIO programs. See Applications for New Awards—Upward \nBound Program, 86 Fed.

The Department’s notices in 2021, 2022, and 2023 expressly incorporated competitive \npreference priorities from the 2021 Final Priorities, and informed prospective applicants that it \nwould use these priorities when making decisions to award new TRIO grants. \n109.  The Upward Bound NIA, Veterans Upward Bound NIA, and Upward Bound Math \nScience NIA all used the “Meeting Student Social, Emotional, and Academic Needs” and the \n“Strengthening Cross-Agency Coordination and Community Engagement to Advance Systemic \nChange” competitive preference priorities from the 2021 Final Priorities. See 86 Fed. Reg. at \n71,460; 87 Fed. Reg. at 24,537; 87 Fed. Reg. at 23,170. \n110.  The Student Support Services NIA used “Meeting Student Social, Emotional, and \nAcademic Needs” and “Increasing Postsecondary Education Access, Affordability, Completion, \nand Post-Enrollment Success” as competitive preference priorities. See 89 Fed. Reg. 35,080. \n111.  The  McNair  NIA  used  “Promoting  Equity  in  Student  Access  to  Educational \nResources and Opportunities” as a competitive preference priority. See 87 Fed. Reg. at 13,280. \n112.  The  “Meeting  Student  Social,  Emotional,  and  Academic  Needs”  competitive \npreference priority awards additional points to projects that are designed to improve students’ \nsocial, emotional, academic, and career development needs, with a focus on underserved students.  \nSee Upward Bound NIA, 86 Fed.

The “Increasing Postsecondary Education Access, Affordability, Completion, and \nPost-Enrollment Success” competitive preference priority awards extra points to projects that are \ndesigned to increase postsecondary access, affordability, completion, and success for underserved \nstudents by increasing access and reducing cost or establishing a system of high-quality data \ncollection and analysis.

See McNair NIA, 87 Fed. Reg. 12,280. \nd.  The Affected Programs apply for TRIO grants and receive awards. \n116.  The Affected Programs timely applied for new TRIO grants, and between 2021 and \n2024,21 received notice  from the Department  that  their applications  had been selected.  For \nexample, the State University of New York at Plattsburgh (“SUNY Plattsburgh”) applied for an \nUpward Bound grant on January 26, 2021. Suffolk University applied for a VUB grant on June 7, \n2022. South Seattle College applied for an EOC grant on February 25, 2021. The University of \nNew Hampshire (“UNH”) applied for a McNair grant on April 25, 2022, and Marquette University \n \n21  FY  2022  Upward  Bound Application  Instructions,  https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/opportunities/instructions\n/PKG00270968-instructions.pdf; FY 2022 Upward Bound Math Science Application, https://apply07.grants.gov\n/apply/opportunities/instructions/PKG00273479-instructions.pdf; FY 2022 Veterans Upward Bound Application, \nhttps://apply07.grants.gov/apply/opportunities/instructions/PKG00273722-instructions.pdf; FY 2021 Talent Search \nApplication, https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/opportunities/instructions/PKG00264704-instructions.pdf, FY Student \nSupport Services Application Instructions, https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/opportunities/instructions/PKG00286185\n-instructions.pdf,  FY  2022  McNair  Application  Instructions,  https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/opportunities/\ninstructions/PKG00272507-instructions.pdf,  EOC  Application  Instructions,  https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/\nopportunities/instructions/PKG00264947-instructions.pdf,  Staff  Training  Application  Instructions, \nhttps://apply07.grants.gov/apply/opportunities/instructions/PKG00284929-instructions.pdf.  \n  - 30 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 31 of 64\n \napplied for a McNair grant on April 25, 2022. Augsberg University also applied for a McNair grant \non April 24, 2022. \n117.  The Department thereafter issued new grants to these and other Affected Programs.  \n118.  The “performance period” of their new grants was five years (or two years for Staff \nTraining), and the budget period was 12 months.  \n119.  Affected  Programs  complied  with  the  applicable  requirements  to  obtain \ncontinuation awards for each budget period of their TRIO grants.  \n120.  First, each “[d]emonstrate[d] that it has made substantial progress in achieving—\n(A) The goals and objectives of the project; and (B) The performance targets in the grantee’s \napproved application, if the Secretary established performance measurement requirements for the \ngrant in the application notice.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(1). \n121.  Second, each submitted “all reports as required by” 34 C.F.R. § 75.118, including \nthe “performance report that provides the most current performance and financial expenditure \ninformation, as directed by the Secretary, that is sufficient to meet the reporting requirements of 2 \nCFR 200.328 and 200.329 and 34 CFR 75.590 and 75.720.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(2). \n122.  Third, each “continued to meet all applicable eligibility requirements of the grant \nprogram.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(3). \n123.  Fourth, each maintained “financial and administrative management systems that \nmeet the requirements in 2 CFR 200.302 and 200.303.” 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(4). \n124.  Additionally, for each fiscal year at issue, Congress appropriated federal funds to \nthe Department for the purpose of “carrying out” the TRIO programs. See discussion supra \nBackground § I.c \n  - 31 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 32 of 64\n \n125.  Every budget period after the first (until the 2025-2026 budget period), each \nAffected Program received a continuation award.  \n126.  The  continuation  awards  issued  to  the  Affected  Programs  contain  the  same \nsubstantive terms, and differ only in the identity of the grant recipient, the type of TRIO grant, the \namount of the grant, and the grant performance and budget periods. \nIV.  The Trump Administration’s Executive Orders on DEI and the Department’s denial \nof continuation awards to the Affected Programs \na.  The Trump Administration’s new policies and priorities  \n127.  The Trump Administration assumed office on January 20, 2025 and immediately \nissued  a  barrage  of  challenges  on  higher  education  and  promulgated  executive  orders  and \ndirectives critical of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.  \n128.  More directly, the President issued a number of executive orders directing the \nDepartment and other agencies to eliminate DEI practices and initiatives from all aspects of the \nfederal  government.  See,  e.g.,  Exec.  Order  No.  14173,  Ending  Illegal  Discrimination  and \nRestoring Merit-Based Opportunity, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,633 (Jan. 21, 2025) (“EO 14173”); Exec. \nOrder No. 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 \nFed. Reg. 8,339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“EO 14151”) (EO 14173 and EO 14151 collectively, the “DEI \nExecutive Orders”).  \n129.  EO 14173 states that “critical and influential institutions of American society,” \nincluding the federal government and institutions of higher education, “have adopted and actively \nuse dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race-and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-\ncalled ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) or ‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ \n(DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.” See 90 Fed. Reg. at 8,633.  \n  - 32 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 33 of 64\n \n130.  EO  14173  expressly  “directs”  the  U.S.  Office  of  Management  and  Budget \n(“OMB”) to “[e]xcise references to DEI and DEIA principles under whatever name they may \nappear,” including federal grants. 90 Fed. Reg. at 8,634.  \n131.  EO 14151 further instructs “each agency, department, or commission head,” to \nprovide OMB a list of all “[f]ederal grantees who received [f]ederal funding to provide or advance \nDEI . . . programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8,339–8,340. \nEO 14151 further directs agency heads to assess the operational impact and cost of those specified \ngrants and recommend action. Id. at 8,340. It expressly directs agency heads to “terminate . . . all \n. . . ‘equity-related’ grants.” Id. at 8,339.  \n132.  Since January 2025, thousands of applicants for and recipients of federal grants and \ncontracts have lost federal funding on account of language appearing in or on their websites, \nadvertisements, logos, catalogs, grant documents, and other materials containing any word or \nphrase that might fall within scope of DEI.  \n133.  The Trump Administration also announced plans to close the Department itself. See \nExec. Order No. 14242, Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and \nCommunities , 90 Fed. Reg. 13,679 (Mar. 20, 2025) (“EO 14242”).  \n134.  EO  14242  directed  the  Secretary,  “to  the  maximum  extent  appropriate  and \npermitted by law,” to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of \nEducation and return authority over education to the States and local communities.” Id.  \nb.  The Trump Administration’s current and future outlook towards TRIO \n135.  In  the  wake  of  President  Trump’s  DEI  Executive  Orders  and  ordering  the \nDepartment and other agencies to review federal-fund recipients and eliminate spending to all \n  - 33 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 34 of 64\n \nrecipients whose grants bore any connection to DEI, the Executive Branch began targeting the \nfederal TRIO programs.  \n136.  To be clear, TRIO programs do not require grant recipients to serve students of any \nparticular race or any other protected characteristic. The authorizing statutes focus eligibility on \ndisability, income, and parent education (targeting first-generation college students). \n137.  Nonetheless, in the Department’s fiscal year 2026 budget request, it proposed \neliminating funding for all TRIO programs, stating:  \nThe Administration does not request funding for the TRIO program for \nfiscal year 2026. TRIO has not met most of its performance measures for a \nnumber  of  years.  States,  localities,  and  universities,  not  the  Federal \ngovernment,  are  best  suited  to  determine  whether  and  how  to  most \neffectively support the activities authorized under this program or similar \nactivities within their own budgets and without unnecessary administrative \nburden imposed by the Federal government.  \nFY 2026 Budget Request, supra¶ 43 n.5, at 41. \n138.  Similarly, OMB on May 2, 2025 proposed eliminating funding for all the TRIO \nprograms. OMB stated: \nTRIO and GEAR UP are a relic of the past when financial incentives were \nneeded to motivate Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) to engage with \nlow-income students and increase access. The lack of action by IHEs also \nmeant that States and local school districts needed additional support to \nprepare low-income students for college. Today, the pendulum has swung \nand access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means. \nIHEs should be using their own resources to engage with K-12 schools in \ntheir communities to recruit students, and then once those students are on \ncampus, aid in their success through to graduation. A renewed focus on \nacademics and scholastic accomplishment by IHEs, rather than engaging in \nwoke  ideology  with  Federal  taxpayer  subsidies,  would  be  a  welcome \nchange for students and the future of the Nation. \n  - 34 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 35 of 64\n \nLetter from Russell Vought, Director of OMB, to the Honorable Susan Collins, Chair, Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations (May 2, 2025).22 \nc.  Under President Trump, the Department issues Notices of Non-Continuation \n139.  In summer 2025, the Affected Programs received a Notice of Non-Continuation \nletter from the Department.  \n140.  The Notices of Non-Continuation informed each Affected Program that “the United \nStates Department of Education has determined not to continue your federal award . . . in its \nentirety” at the end of their respective budget periods in 2025.  \n141.  Affected Programs, including but not limited to Suffolk, South Seattle College, \nMarquette, SUNY-Plattsburgh, UNH, and many others postsecondary institutions and nonprofits \nwith TRIO grants, also received a Notice of Non-Continuation throughout summer 2025 and as \nrecently as mid-September 2025.  \n142.  Depending on the type of TRIO grant, the Notice of Non-Continuation informed \nAffected Programs that their grants were discontinued effective May 30, 2025, August 31, 2025, \nor September 30, 2025.  \n143.  The Department’s stated reasons for discontinuing the Affected Programs’ grants \nare similar, if not identical. \n144.  According to the Notices of Non-Continuation, the Affected Programs did not \nreceive continuation awards because the Department determined that their TRIO projects were \n“not in the best interest of the Federal Government” under 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5). \n145.  The Notices of Non-Continuation generally stated the following stock language: \n \n22  Available  at  https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-\nRequest.pdf. \n  - 35 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 36 of 64\n \nContinuation requires “a determination from the Secretary that continuation \nof the project is in the best interest of the Federal Government.” Id. The \nDepartment has undertaken a review of grants and determined that the grant \nspecified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that  reflect  the  prior \nAdministration’s priorities and policy preferences and conflict with those \nof the current Administration, in that the programs: violate the letter or \npurpose of Federal civil rights law; conflict with the Department’s policy of \nprioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; undermine the \nwell-being of the students these programs are intended to help; or constitute \nan inappropriate use of federal funds. The grant is therefore inconsistent \nwith, and no longer effectuates, the best interest of the Federal Government \nand will not be continued. \n146.  The Notices of Non-Continuation identified information in the Affected Programs \ngrant materials, including in their applications for new grants that had already been selected in \n2024 or earlier, that “may conflict with the Department's policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education;” or may “violate the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.” \n147.  It  is  apparent  from  the  Notices  of  Non-Continuation  that  the  Department’s \ndetermination was based on the current Administration’s new policies, including those set forth in \nthe DEI Executive Orders.  \n148.  The Department advised the Affected Programs that they had the opportunity to \nrequest reconsideration. The Affected Programs timely submitted requests for reconsideration; \nhowever, the Department did not respond to these requests prior to the date of this Complaint. \nHARM TO AFFECTED PROGRAMS \n149.  The harms to the Affected Programs are severe. First and foremost, the Affected \nPrograms have lost their grant funding. The loss of funding means that they can no longer maintain \ntheir projects and are terminating employees and staff whose salaries were funded by TRIO grants. \nIt also inevitably impacts students who the Affected Programs can no longer serve. This is true for \n  - 36 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 37 of 64\n \nmany  members  of  COE  who  are  among  the  Affected  Programs,  such  as  Suffolk,  SUNY \nPlattsburgh, Marquette, UNH, and South Seattle College.23  \n150.  Beyond the obvious harm with respect to the immediate loss of funding, the \nAffected Programs face two more veiled harms that are nevertheless concrete, severe, and a direct \nconsequence of the Department’s decision not to continue their TRIO projects. \n1.  Due to the Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation, the Affected Programs \nwill  not  be  able  to  receive  prior  experience  points  during  future  grant \ncompetitions. \n151.  If a TRIO grant applicant proposes to “continue” serving substantially the same \ntarget population as under an existing “expiring” project, the Department allows the applicant to \nearn  prior  experience  points  evaluated  under  program-specific  criteria.  See  34  C.F.R. \n§ 645.30(a)(2)(i) (Upward Bound, Veterans Upward Bound, and Upward Bound Math & Science); \n§ 643.20(a)(2)(i) (Talent Search); § 646.20(a)(2)(i) (Student Support Services); § 647.20(a)(2)(i) \n(McNair); § 644.20(a)(2)(i) (EOC).  \n152.  The Department evaluates the prior experience of an applicant based on three years \nthat it designates in the notice inviting applications. See 34 C.F.R. § 645.30(a)(2)(iii) (Upward \nBound, Veterans Upward Bound, and Upward Bound Math & Science); § 643.20(a)(2)(iii) (Talent \nSearch);  § 646.20(a)(2)(iii)  (Student  Support  Services);  § 647.20(a)(2)(iv)  (McNair); \n§ 644.20(a)(2)(iii) (EOC).  \n153.  An applicant may earn up to 15 points for each designated project year. An \nApplicant’s final prior experience score is the average of the three designated years and a \nmaximum of 15 points total. See 34 C.F.R. § 645.30(a)(2)(ii)–(v) (Upward Bound, Veterans \nUpward Bound, and Upward Bound Math & Science); § 643.20(a)(2)(ii)–(v) (Talent Search); \n \n23 There are many more Affected Programs, and COE will identify them at the appropriate time in this litigation.  \n  - 37 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 38 of 64\n \n§ 646.20(a)(2)  (ii)–(v)  (Student  Support  Services);  § 647.20(a)(2)  (ii)  &  (iv)–(vi)  (McNair); \n§ 644.20(a)(2)(ii)–(v) (EOC). \n154.  Prior experience points for Staff Training grants operate slightly differently because \nthe program only lasts for two years. Instead of averaging three years, prior experience points are \nbased on the applicant’s performance during the first year of the Staff Training grant. See 34 C.F.R. \n§ 642.20(a)(2)(i). The Department selects applications for funding within each absolute-preference \npriority and only considers prior experience for Staff Training grants if within each particular \nabsolute-preference priority, the Department does not have enough funds to fund all applications \nat the peer review score. See 34 C.F.R. § 642.20(c)–(d). \n155.  For all programs that qualify for prior experience, the Department calculates points \nbased on certain performance metrics, which are different for each program depending on the \nprogram’s target population and purpose. The metrics include enrollment numbers, retention and \ngraduation, degree completion, and/or postsecondary retention. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 645.32 (Upward \nBound, Veterans Upward Bound, and Upward Bound Math & Science); 643.22 (Talent Search); \n646.22 (Student Support Services); 647.22 (McNair); 644.22 (EOC); 642.22 (Staff Training). \n156.  Because the Affected Programs (who received Notices of Non-Continuation) can \nno longer propose to “continue” to serve substantially the same population that they are serving \nunder an “expiring” grant, they will be ineligible for prior experience points in any future grant \ncompetition. \n157.  The inability to earn prior experience points will have a significant effect on the \nAffected Programs in the future. Because prior experience points constitute up to 15 total points, \nAffected Programs may be unable to score high enough to receive future grant awards for many \nyears to come. \n  - 38 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 39 of 64\n \n158.  Under the criteria for Upward Bound, Veteran’s Upward Bound, Upward Bound \nMath & Science, Talent Search, Student Support Services, McNair, and EOC, applicants may earn \nup to 100 points based on the standard criteria. See 34 C.F.R. § 645.30(a)(1)(ii) (Upward Bound, \nVeteran’s Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math & Science); 643.20(a)(1)(ii) (Talent Search); \n646.20(a)(1)(ii) (Student Support Services); 647.20(a)(1)(ii) (McNair); 644.20(a)(1)(ii) (EOC). \nIncluding prior experience points, applicants can score up to 115 points. \n159.  The Affected Programs, however, may only score up to a maximum of 100 out of \n115 points. \n160.  Staff Training applicants can score up to 75 points using the standard criteria. See \n34 C.F.R. § 642.20(a)(1). Including prior experience, Staff Training applicants may score up to 90 \npoints. \n161.  The Affected Programs that operated Staff Training projects may only score up to \n75 out of 90 points. \n162.  This harm is concrete and actual. Without continuing programs, the Affected \nPrograms  cannot  receive  prior  experience  points.  And  without  prior  experience  points,  the \nAffected Programs are at a significant disadvantage during the subsequent grant competitions for \neach respective TRIO program. \n2.  The Affected Programs will not be able to seek the same amount of their \nprevious grant awards during future competitions. \n163.  With respect to the amount of a possible grant award, the most recent grant \ncompetition for each TRIO program separated applicants into two groups: applicants who were \ncurrently receiving the same type of TRIO grant that they were applying for, and applicants who \nwere not currently receiving the same type of TRIO grant that they were applying for. \n  - 39 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 40 of 64\n \n164.

The Affected Programs previously operated Upward Bound, Veterans Upward \nBound, Upward Bound Math & Science, Talent Search, Student Support Services, McNair, and \nEducational Opportunity Centers TRIO projects. \n172.  As  a  result  of  the  Department’s  determination  to  discontinue  the  Affected \nPrograms’ projects, they will be treated as if they never operated a TRIO project at all when \napplying for future grant funds. Although the Affected Programs successfully operated TRIO \nprojects—in some cases for many years or decades—they will be treated as a brand-new applicant. \n  - 43 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 44 of 64\n \nVIOLATIONS OF LAW \n1.  The Department failed to follow the procedural requirements that every civil \nrights statute cited in its regulations mandate before terminating funding. \n173.  The Department decided to not continue the Affected Programs in part because \ntheir projects allegedly “violate the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.” \n174.  34 C.F.R. § 75.500 outlines the requirements for grantees to comply with federal \ncivil rights laws and specifically cites Title VI and Title IX. \n175.  Title VI outlines a series of specific procedures that must be followed before the \nDepartment could deny funding to a grant applicant based on Title VI compliance. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1. Title IX mirrors these procedural requirements. See discussion supra § II.d. \n176.  Terminating federal funding under Title VI or Title IX requires that the Department \nfirst have attempted to seek voluntary compliance. See discussion supra § II.d. \n177.  The Department’s regulations outline a detailed process for Title VI compliance. \n34 C.F.R. Part 100 “effectuate[s] the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 100.1.  \n178.  34 C.F.R. Part 100 “applies to any program to which Federal financial assistance is \nauthorized to be extended to a recipient under a law administered by the Department, including \nthe Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A of this regulation.”  \n179.  Appendix A expressly refers to programs under Title IV of the HEA, including \nTRIO programs. Appx. A to Part 100, Part 1(21).  \n180.  34 C.F.R. § 100.6 provides that “the responsible Department official shall to the \nfullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part \nand shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this \npart.”  \n  - 44 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 45 of 64\n \n181.  34 C.F.R. § 100.8 provides that “[i]f there appears to be a failure or threatened \nfailure to comply with this regulation, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance \ncannot  be corrected by informal means, compliance with  this part may be effected  by the \nsuspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by \nany other means authorized by law.”  \n182.  34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) provides that “[n]o order suspending, terminating or refusing \nto grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible \nDepartment official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has \ndetermined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,” (2) “there has been an express \nfinding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to \ncomply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part,” and (3) “the expiration of 30 days \nafter the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate \nhaving legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances \nand the grounds for such action.” \n183.  Prior to sending the Notices of Non-Continuation, the Department had not informed \nthe Affected Programs, formally or informally, about any failure or threatened failure to comply \nwith Title VI or Title IX. The Department never attempted to seek voluntary compliance from any \nAffected Program. Before receiving a Notice of Non-Continuation, no Affected Member received \na communication from the Department with respect to noncompliance with federal civil rights law. \n184.  The Department likewise did not follow any of the other procedures under 34 \nC.F.R. Part 100. The Department never provided the Affected Programs with an opportunity for a \nhearing, and accordingly, never made any express finding on the record that any of the Affected \nPrograms failed to comply with Title VI or Title IX. \n  - 45 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 46 of 64\n \n185.  Upon information and belief, the Department, through the Secretary, never filed a \nfull written report of the circumstances and the grounds for discontinuing the grants with the Senate \nCommittees on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions or the House Committee on Education and \nthe Workforce. \n186.  Consequently,  the  Department  acted  contrary  to  law,  in  excess  of  statutory \nauthority, and without observance of procedure. \n2.  The  Department’s  interpretation  of  34  C.F.R.  § 75.253(a)(5)  to  deny \ncontinuation awards is in excess of statutory authority. \n187.  The Department’s current interpretation of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) that it used to \ndeny the continuation awards is not authorized by any statutory provision. \n188.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) states, “A grantee, in order to receive a continuation award \nfrom the Secretary for a budget period after the first budget period of an approved multiyear \nproject, must . . . [r]eceive a determination form the Secretary that continuation of the project is in \nthe best interest of the Federal Government.”24 \n189.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253(b) states: \nIn determining whether the grantee has met the requirements described in \n[§ 75.253(a)]  of  this  section,  the  Secretary  may  consider  any  relevant \ninformation  regarding  grantee  performance.  This  includes  considering \nreports  required  by  § 75.118,  performance  measures  established  under \n§ 75.110, financial information required by 2 CFR part 200, and any other \nrelevant information. \n190.  Title 20 authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations necessary to “administer \nand manage” the functions of the Department. 20 U.S.C. § 1221e-3 delates general authority to \nthe Secretary, and states: \n \n24 As stated above, prior to 2024 the “best interest of the Federal Government” requirement was in 34 C.F.R. \n§ 75.253(a)(4) and had minor differences in phrasing. \n  - 46 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 47 of 64\n \nThe Secretary, in order to carry out functions otherwise vested in the \nSecretary by law or by delegation of authority pursuant to law, and subject \nto limitations as may be otherwise imposed by law, is authorized to make, \npromulgate, issue, rescind, and amend rules and regulations governing the \nmanner  of  operation  of,  and  governing  the  applicable  programs \nadministered by, the Department. \n20 U.S.C. § 3474 states: \nThe Secretary is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as the \nSecretary determines necessary or appropriate to administer and manage the \nfunctions of the Secretary or the Department. \n191.  Again, 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(a) states that the Secretary “shall . . . carry out” \nTRIO programs. \n192.  And 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(b)(2) requires the Secretary to award grants for a five-\nyear period, which necessitates the issuance of continuation awards. \n193.  Interpreting and applying 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) in an unfettered manner to \ninstead deny continuation awards and reduce the number of TRIO projects is contrary to the plain \nterms of 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(a). \n194.  Section 75.253(b) limits the Department’s “best interest” determination under \n§ 75.253(a)(5) to considering information “regarding grantee performance.”  \n195.  Although 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(b) contains an open-ended reference to “any other \nrelevant  information,”  that  reference  is  cabined  by  the  earlier  use  of  “regarding  grantee \nperformance.” \n196.  This interpretation is confirmed by the use of ejusdem generis, a principle of \nstatutory interpretation that requires a general term following a series of specific terms to be \nunderstood “as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.” United States v. \nAlford, 89 F.4th 943, 952 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \n  - 47 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 48 of 64\n \n197.  Noscitur a sociis, another canon of statutory interpretation meaning that a word is \nknown by the company it keeps, also confirms this limited interpretation. This canon “avoid[s] \nascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus \ngiving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.” Id. (quoting Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. \n528, 543 (2015)). \n198.  Accordingly, “any other relevant information” refers to information similar to \n“reports  required  by  § 75.118,”  “performance  measures  established  under  § 75.110,”  and \n“financial information required by 2 CFR part 200,” which all relate to a grantee’s performance. \n199.  Moreover, Congress, not the Department unilaterally, determines what the “best \ninterests of the federal government are.”  \n200.  A “fundamental problem” with the Department’s stated reason for discontinuing \nthe  grants  is  that  “the  ‘federal  interest’  does  not  necessarily  mean”  the  federal  interest  as \ndetermined by [the agency].” Healthy Teen Network v. Azar, 322 F. Supp. 3d 647, 660–61 (D. Md. \n2018). “The ultimate touchstone for all agency action is not its own guidance documents, or even \nregulations, but the power delegated to it by Congress.” Id.; see also id. at 660 (an agency “cannot \nprovide just any reason for its decision, that reason must be a change in the federal interest. HHS \nprovides no evidence a change in the federal interest motivated its decision here.”).  \n201.  The federal government’s interest in the TRIO programs is evident in 60-plus years \nof legislation and appropriations towards the TRIO programs. See supra Background § I.b–I.d \n202.  Congress has declared the federal government’s “priority” and interest in grant \nprograms like TRIO that increase disadvantaged students’ access to educational opportunities \nmore generally. Congress in 1974 declared its “National Policy with Respect to Equal Educational \nOpportunity” as follows: “Recognizing that the Nation’s economic, political, and social security \n  - 48 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 49 of 64\n \nrequire a well-educated citizenry, the Congress (1) reaffirms, as a matter of high priority, the \nNation’s goal of equal educational opportunity, and (2) declares it to be the policy of the United \nStates of America that every citizen is entitled to an education to meet his or her full potential \nwithout financial barriers.” Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-380, § 801, 88 Stat. \n484, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 1221-1. \n203.  The Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation completely ignore the federal \ngovernment’s interest in the TRIO programs and the benefits they provide.  \n204.  Where an agency does “not offer a rational connection between the facts and the \nchoice made, but merely articulate[s] policy concerns and [its] own discretion to terminate the \nprogram for whatever reason,” its “reasoning or lack thereof is arbitrary and capricious.” Planned \nParenthood of Greater Wash. & N. Idaho v. U.S. Dep’t of HHS, 328 F. Supp. 3d 1133, 1149 (E.D. \nWash. 2018).  \n205.  For these reasons, the Department’s interpretation and use of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253 is \nin excess of statutory authorization, and is contrary to law. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount I – Administrative Procedures Act \nContrary to Law, In Excess of Statutory Authority, and Without Observance of Procedure \n(Title VI and Title IX) \n206.

The APA provides that “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, \nor adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is \nentitled to judicial review thereof.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. A Court is required to “hold unlawful and set \naside agency action” that is “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory . . . authority,” \nor “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D). \n  - 49 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 50 of 64\n \n208.  Before denying or terminating federal funding for noncompliance with Title VI, an \nagency  or  department  must  first  seek  voluntary  compliance  from  the  recipient.  See  42 \nU.S.C.§ 2000d-1. \n209.  Before denying or terminating federal funding for noncompliance with Title IX, an \nagency or department must first seek voluntary compliance from the recipient. See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1682. \n210.  The Department did not seek voluntary compliance from any Affected Program \nbefore sending a Notice of Non-Continuation or follow any of the other procedures required by \nTitle VI and Title IX prior to discontinuing a grant. See supra ¶¶ 173–186. \n211.  Each Affected Program has been harmed from the Department’s failure to comply \nwith civil rights law. Each Affected Program is no longer receiving grant funding, will be unable \nto seek its prior award amount, and may be ineligible to receive prior experience points during the \nnext applicable grant competition.  \n212.  COE is entitled to a declaration that the Department acted contrary to law, in excess \nof statutory authority, and without observance of procedure, and a preliminary injunction vacating \nand setting aside the Notice of Non-Continuation and directing the Department to immediately \nreconsider its action on the Affected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in accordance with the \nHEA, Title VI and Title IX, and the applicable Department regulations.  \nCount II –Administrative Procedures Act \nContrary to Law, In Excess of Statutory Authority, and Without Observance of Procedure \n(Notice-and-Comment) \n213.  COE incorporates the preceding allegations as if set forth fully herein \n  - 50 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 51 of 64\n \n214.  The Department is required under GEPA to follow the APA’s notice-and-comment \nrulemaking procedure when setting the policies, priorities and other rules for grant awards. See 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1221e-4, 1232(a)(2), (d). \n215.  “The APA generally requires that before a federal agency adopts a rule it must first \npublish the proposed rule in the Federal Register and provide interested parties with an opportunity \nto submit comments and information concerning the proposal.” N.H. Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 887 F.3d \n62, 70 (1st Cir. 2018) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553).  \n216.  “Failure to abide by these requirements renders a rule procedurally invalid.” Id.; \nAFL-CIO v. Chao, 496 F. Supp. 2d 76, 84 (D.D.C. 2007) (“The APA puts the agency to a simple \neither/or choice: either notice-and-comment procedures or the good-cause exception.”).  \n217.  The  Department  did  not  follow  the  statutorily  required  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking procedures to replace or otherwise rescind the selection criteria and/or competitive \npreference priorities in the NIAs.  \n218.  In  general,  “an  utter  failure  to  comply  with  notice  and  comment  cannot  be \nconsidered harmless if there is any uncertainty at all as to the effect of that failure.” Am. Pub. Gas \nAss’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 72 F.4th 1324, 1338 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  \n219.  The  Department  did  not  follow  the  statutorily  required  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking procedures for establishing the new policies and priorities set forth in the Notices of \nNon-Continuation that it relied on to discontinue the Affected Programs’ TRIO grants.  \n220.  The Department improperly applied new policies, including those set forth in the \nTrump Administration’s DEI Executive Orders, as a basis to discontinue the Affected Programs’ \ngrants. \n  - 51 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 52 of 64\n \n221.  Accordingly, the Department did not comply with notice-and-comment rulemaking \nas required by GEPA and the APA, and the Department further acted contrary to law, in excess of \nstatutory authority, and without observance of procedure.  \n222.  Further, the Department further  acted  contrary  to  law, in  excess  of statutory \nauthority, and without observance of procedure because it penalized the Affected Programs for \nmaking statements and including information in applications that was responsive to the selection \ncriteria and/or competitive preference priorities in the Department’s NIAs from 2024 and earlier \nthat applied to the Affected Members’ respective TRIO grants.  \n223.  Further, the Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation are contrary to law and in \nexcess  of  statutory  authority  because  the  Department  penalized  the  Affected  Programs  for \ncomplying with the GEPA Equity Directive required by law.  \n224.  COE is entitled to a declaration that the Department acted contrary to law, in excess \nof statutory authority, and without observance of procedure, and a preliminary injunction vacating \nand setting aside the Notices of Non-Continuation and directing the Department to immediately \nreconsider its action on the Affected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in accordance with the \nHEA, Title VI and Title IX, and the applicable Department regulations.  \nCount III – Administrative Procedures Act \nArbitrary and Capricious \n225.  COE incorporates the preceding allegations as if set forth fully herein. \n226.  The Department’s Notice of Non-Continuation is arbitrary and capricious because \nit did not reasonably explain how the Affected Programs violated federal civil rights law. \n227.  The “well-worn arbitrary-and-capricious standard ensures that an administrative \nagency ‘examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action \nincluding a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’” FDA v. Wages & \n  - 52 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 53 of 64\n \nWhite Lion Invs., 604 U.S. 542, 567–68 (2025) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  \n228.  The  Department’s  Notices  of  Non-Continuation  are  arbitrary  and  capricious \nbecause they did not reasonably explain how the Affected Programs’ projects were not consistent \nwith the Department’s new policies or priorities.  \n229.  In discontinuing the Affected Programs’ TRIO grants, the Department entirely \ndisregarded the Affected Programs’ reliance interests in the Department’s use of the selection \ncriteria and priorities in the NIAs from 2024 and earlier.  \n230.  The  Department’s  Notices  of  Non-Continuation  are  arbitrary  and  capricious \nbecause the Department relied on factors that it was not entitled to consider.  \n231.  The  Department’s  Notices  of  Non-Continuation  are  arbitrary  and  capricious \nbecause  they  reflect  the  Department’s  change  in  position  that  it  did  not  explain  or  even \nacknowledge.  \n232.  Under  the  “change-in-position  doctrine  . . .  agencies  are  free  to  change  their \nexisting policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change, display awareness \nthat they are changing position, and consider serious reliance interests.” Encino Motorcars, LLC \nv. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221–22 (2016).  \n233.  The  Department’s  Notices  of  Non-Continuation  are  arbitrary  and  capricious \nbecause the Department expressly encouraged the Affected Programs to respond to the competitive \npreference priorities in the NIAs from 2024 and earlier and has now penalized them for doing so. \n234.  The  Department’s  Notices  of  Non-Continuation  are  arbitrary  and  capricious \nbecause the Department encouraged the Affected Programs to exercise discretion in preparing their \n  - 53 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 54 of 64\n \napplications responding to the GEPA Equity Directive required by law and has now penalized \nthem for doing so. \n235.  The Department’s interpretation and application of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) is \narbitrary and capricious. In discontinuing the Affected Programs’ TRIO grants, the Department \nentirely disregarded the Affected Programs’ reliance interests in the previous interpretation of \n§ 75.253(a)(5). See DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30–33 (2020). \n236.  COE is entitled to a declaration that the Department’s Notice of Non-Continuation \nwas arbitrary and capricious, and a preliminary injunction vacating and setting aside the Notice of \nNon-Continuation and directing the Department to immediately reconsider its action on the \nAffected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in accordance with the HEA, Title VI and Title IX, \nand the applicable Department regulations.  \nCount IV – Administrative Procedures Act \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction and Authorization \n237.  COE incorporates the preceding allegations as if set forth fully herein. \n238.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(c), “[t]he reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set \naside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right[.]” \n239.  “Agencies have only those powers given to them by Congress, and enabling \nlegislation is generally not an open book to which the agency may add pages and change the plot \nline.” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) (quotations and citation omitted). \n240.  The Department’s interpretation and application of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) is not \nauthorized by statute. \n241.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) and its predecessor 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(4) have granted \nthe Department the power to determine whether a continuation award is “in the best interest of the \n  - 54 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 55 of 64\n \nFederal government” since the first implementing regulations were created after the Department \nwas formed in 1979. See 45 Fed. Reg. 22,494, 22,510 (Apr. 3, 1980).25  \n242.  The Department has given no explanation whatsoever (other than a vague reference \nto the Trump Administration’s new policies and priorities) to support its decision to reinterpret 34 \nC.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) to give itself unfettered authority to not continue a grant.  \n243.  All  of  the  statutes  authorizing  TRIO  programs  overwhelmingly  require  the \nDepartment to issue continuation awards. The Department issues five-year and two-year grants, \nand the statutory scheme does not contemplate “reapplying” during that period. Instead, the \nstatutory scheme shows that the Department is supposed to issue continuation awards provided \nthat a grantee has met a number of performance metrics. Cf. Education Department General \nAdministrative Regulations and Related Regulatory Provisions, 89 Fed. Reg. 70,300, 70,316 (Aug. \n29, 2024) (“In general, we do not deny a large number of non-competing continuation awards and, \nif that does happen, grantees are often aware of the likelihood of the decision well in advance and \noften cite no concerns if they do not receive a continuation award.”). \n244.  Instead of cabining its use of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) to the “best interest of the \nFederal government” with respect to the grantees’ performance, as is the case with all other \nsubsections of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a) and as is required by § 75.253(b), it has instead applied (a)(5) \nin a manner that gives itself complete discretion to deny continuation awards based on the \nDepartment’s policies and priorities that exist nowhere in the applicable law. \n \n25 After the Department of Education was split from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, these Direct \nGrant regulations were transferred from Chapter 45 to Chapter 34, and 45 C.F.R. Part 100 became 34 C.F.R. Part 75. \nSee Transfer and Redesignation of ED Regulations, 45 Fed. Reg. 77,368 (Nov. 21, 1980).  \n  - 55 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 56 of 64\n \n245.  The Department acted in excess of statutory jurisdiction and authority because it \nfailed to consider grantee’s performance in the Notices of Non-Continuation and instead relied on \nfactors it was not entitled to consider.  \n246.  COE is entitled to a declaration that the Department acted in excess of statutory \njurisdiction and authority, and a preliminary injunction vacating and setting aside the Notice of \nNon-Continuation and directing the Department to immediately reconsider its  action on the \nAffected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in accordance with the HEA, Title VI and Title IX, \nand the applicable Department regulations. \nCount V – Violation of the U.S. Constitution \nVoid for Vagueness under the 5th Amendment \n247.  COE incorporates all paragraphs by reference as if set forth fully herein. \n248.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) is clear on its face in that the “best interest of the Federal \ngovernment” must be assessed by the Department in relation to grantee performance.  \n249.  The Department’s interpretation and application of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) is \nunlawful because the Department’s interpretation renders the regulation impermissibly vague and \nthus void.  \n250.  “A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws which regulate persons or \nentities must give fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.” FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012).  \n251.  “The  Due  Process  Clause  thus  ‘requires  the  invalidation  of  laws  that  are \nimpermissibly vague’—specifically, a law is void for vagueness if it ‘fails to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.’” Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP v. \nExec. Off. of President, 784 F. Supp. 3d 127 (D.D.C. 2025) (quoting Fox Television Stations, 567 \n  - 56 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 57 of 64\n \nU.S. at 253). The void for vagueness doctrine “addresses at least two connected but discrete due \nprocess concerns: first, that regulated parties should know what is required of them so they may \nact accordingly; second, precision and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing the law do \nnot act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.” Id. (quoting Fox Television Stations, 567 U.S. at \n253). \n252.  The Department’s interpretation and application of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) gives \nit unlimited and unpredictable discretion to deny continuation awards that the authorizing statute \ncontemplates for four years following the initial one-year grant term (5 years total).  \n253.  The Department has never used 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) before in this completely \nopen-ended manner. Given the vagueness of the regulation as interpreted by the Department, the \nDepartment may not rely on it to take action against the Affected Programs. \n254.  COE is entitled to a declaration that the Department’s Notice of Non-Continuation \nwas not entitled to rely on its interpretation of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) because the Department’s \ninterpretation renders the regulation void for vagueness, and a preliminary injunction vacating and \nsetting  aside  the  Notice  of  Non-Continuation  and  directing  the  Department  to  immediately \nreconsider its action on the Affected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in accordance with the \nHEA, Title VI and Title IX, and the applicable Department regulations.  \nCount VI – Violation of the U.S. Constitution \nSeparation of Powers & the Delegation Doctrine \n255.  COE incorporates the preceding allegations as if set forth fully herein. \n256.  The U.S. Constitution states: “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \nin a Congress of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. \n257.  The Department is required to carry out the TRIO programs under the HEA.  \n  - 57 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 58 of 64\n \n258.  Congress appropriated to the Department $3,080,952,000 in fiscal year 2025 funds \nfor carrying out the programs within the Higher Education budget account, including the TRIO \nprograms.  \n259.  Congress intended that at least $1.19 billion appropriated in the Higher Education \nbudget account for the 2025 fiscal year be allocated to the TRIO programs.  \n260.  Upon information and belief, the Department has not obligated the full amount of \nfiscal year 2025 funds appropriated by Congress towards the TRIO programs.  \n261.  The Department’s failure to obligate and spend the full amount of fiscal year 2025 \nfunds for the TRIO programs is in violation of the Separation of Powers. \n262.  The Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation violate the Delegation Doctrine.  \n263.  “The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrine is that the lawmaking function \nbelongs to Congress, and may not be conveyed to another branch or entity.” Loving v. United \nStates, 517 U.S. 748, 758 (1996) (internal citations omitted). \n264.  When the Department interpreted and applied 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) to give \nitself unfettered, unbounded authority to deny continuation awards that are statutorily mandated \nby Congress, it violated the Delegation Doctrine as established by the U.S. Constitution and \nexplained by the U.S. Supreme Court. \n265.  COE is entitled to a declaration that the Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation \nwere in violation of the Constitution, that the failure to obligate and expend fiscal year 2025 funds \ntowards carrying out the TRIO programs was in violation of the Constitution, and a preliminary \ninjunction extending the period of availability for fiscal year 2025 funds, beyond September 30, \n2025, for any remaining unobligated fiscal year 2025 funds of the $3,080,952,000 that Congress \nappropriated to the Department’s Higher Education budget account, and further, vacating and \n  - 58 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 59 of 64\n \nsetting aside the Notices of Non-Continuation and directing the Department to immediately \nreconsider its action on the Affected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in accordance with the \nHEA, Title VI and Title IX, and the applicable Department regulations.  \nCount VII – Violation of the U.S. Constitution \n Violation of The Take Care Clause \n266.  COE incorporates the preceding allegations as if set forth fully herein. \n267.  The U.S. Constitution states, “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \nin a Congress of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. “Every Bill” shall be passed by both \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President “before it [may] become \na Law.” See U.S Const. art I, § , cl. 1–2. And the President “shall take Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed[.]” See U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n268.  “In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws \nare faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. \nv. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952). \n269.  The Department is required to carry out the TRIO programs under the HEA.  \n270.  Congress appropriated to the Department $3,080,952,000 in fiscal year 2025 funds \nfor carrying out the programs within the Higher Education budget account, including the TRIO \nprograms.  \n271.  Congress intended that at least $1.19 billion appropriated to the Department in the \nHigher Education budget account for the 2025 fiscal year be allocated to the TRIO programs.  \n272.  Upon information and belief, the Department has not obligated the full amount of \nfiscal year 2025 funds towards the TRIO programs.  \n273.  The Department’s failure to obligate the full amount of fiscal year 2025 funds for \nthe TRIO programs is in violation of the Take Care Clause.  \n  - 59 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 60 of 64\n \n274.  The Executive Branch cannot act under the guise of enforcing a congressional \nenactment  to  create new policies and enforce those policies with the force of federal  law. \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube, 343 U.S. at 587–88 (“The President’s order does not direct that a \ncongressional policy be executed in a manner prescribed by Congress—it directs that a presidential \npolicy be executed in a manner prescribed by the President.”); see also Kendall v. U.S. ex rel. \nStokes, 37 U.S. 524, 613 (1838) (rejecting the notion that “the obligation imposed on the President \nto see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution.”) \n275.  The Department’s implementation of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) is not a faithful use \nof congressionally enacted laws. 20 U.S.C. § 1070a-11(a) states that the “Secretary shall . . . carry \nout a program of making grants.”  \n276.  Accordingly, the Department’s implementation and use of 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) \nviolates the President’s duty to ensure that the law is faithfully executed. \n277.  COE is entitled to a declaration that the Department’s Notice of Non-Continuation \nwas in violation of the Constitution, a declaration that the failure to obligate and expend fiscal year \n2025 funds towards carrying out the TRIO programs was in violation of the Constitution, and a \npreliminary injunction extending the period of availability for fiscal year 2025 funds, beyond \nSeptember 30, 2025, for any remaining unobligated fiscal year 2025 funds of the $3,080,952,000 \nthat  Congress  appropriated  to  the  Department’s  Higher  Education  budget  account,  and  a \npreliminary injunction vacating and setting aside the Notice of Non-Continuation and directing the \nDepartment to immediately reconsider its action on the Affected Programs’ respective TRIO \ngrants, in accordance with the HEA, Title VI and Title IX, and the applicable Department \nregulations.  \n  - 60 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 61 of 64\n \nCount VIII: Ultra vires \n278.  COE incorporates the preceding allegations as if set forth fully herein \n279.  Ultra vires review of the Department’s action, which is proper when (1) review is \nnot expressly precluded by statute, (2) there is no alternative procedure for review of the statutory \nclaim and (3) the challenged action is “plainly” in “excess of [the agency’s] delegated powers and \ncontrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that is clear and mandatory.” Changji Esquel Textile \nCo. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \n280.  If this Court does not grant a preliminary injunction pursuant to COE’s APA or \nstandalone Constitutional claims, COE is entitled to a declaration that by sending the Notices of \nNon-Continuation to the Affected Programs, the Department acted ultra vires, in excess of its \nstatutory authorities under the HEA, and a preliminary injunction vacating and setting aside the \nNotices of Non-Continuation and directing the Department to immediately reconsider its action on \nthe Affected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in accordance with the HEA, Title VI and Title \nIX, and the applicable Department regulations.  \nCount IX: Writ of Mandamus  \n281.  COE incorporates the preceding allegations as if set forth fully herein \n282.  “The peremptory common-law writs are among the most potent weapons in the \njudicial arsenal.” Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 107 (1967).  \n283.  A district court has original jurisdiction in the nature of mandamus only if (1) the \nplaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other \nadequate remedy available to the plaintiff. In re Nat’l Nurses United, 47 F.4th 746, 752 n.4 (D.C. \nCir. 2022); 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  \n  - 61 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03514     Document 1     Filed 09/30/25     Page 62 of 64\n \n284.  The  Department  must  issue  continuation  awards  to  recipients  based  on \nperformance, and not based on information in recipients’ applications (which have already been \nselected), and not based on new policies or priorities not published in the notices of invitation. The \nDepartment cannot retroactively replace priorities in the grant solicitations with new policies and \npriorities that have not gone through the requisite notice-and-comment rulemaking procedure.  \n285.  If the Court determines that COE’s requested injunction is appropriate, it need not \nconsider this mandamus claim. Otherwise, COE is entitled to a writ of mandamus ordering the \nDepartment to vacate and set aside the Notice of Non-Continuation and directing the Department \nto immediately reconsider its action on the Affected Programs’ respective TRIO grants, in \naccordance with the HEA, Title VI and Title IX, and the applicable Department regulations.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n286.  COE seeks the following relief:  \na.  An order and declaration that the Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation to \nthe Affected Programs are in excess of statutory authority and jurisdiction and \ncontrary to law; \n \nb.  An order and declaration that the Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation to \nthe Affected Programs are arbitrary and capricious;  \n \nc.  An order and declaration that the Department’s Notices of Non-Continuation to \nthe Affected Programs are not in observance of procedure required by law;  \n \nd.  An order and declaration that the Department’s interpretation and application \nof 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) with respect to the Notices of Non-Continuation to \nthe Affected Programs is void for vagueness;  \n \ne.  An order and declaration that the Department’s interpretation and application \nof 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) with respect to the Notices of Non-Continuation to \nthe  Affected  Programs  violated  the  Separation  of  Powers  doctrine,  the \nDelegation Doctrine, and the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution;  \n \nf.
