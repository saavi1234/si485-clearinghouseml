The Court is required to continue its constitutional functions, and therefore the request for a stay is DENIED. Department of Justice contingency plan states: \"If a court denies such a request [to stay or continue] and orders a case to continue, the Government will comply with the court's order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue.\" In light of the parties' agreement that the defendants will not enforce the challenged provision before November 14, 2025, the revised proposed briefing scheduled is GRANTED. Defendants shall file their response to the preliminary injunction motion by October 22, 2025 and Plaintiffs shall file their reply by October 29, 2025. So Ordered by District Judge Melissa R. DuBose on 10/6/2025. (Urizandi, Nissheneyra)"

Over the last month-and-a-half, Defendants have notified Plaintiff States of a new, \npost hoc condition that precludes Plaintiff States from using some victim services and criminal \njustice funds for legal services to immigrants. Defendants have offered no explanation for these \nnew conditions, much less any explanation of how these new conditions apply in practice. \nDefendants’ actions violate the Spending Clause, are arbitrary and capricious, and are contrary to \nlaw.   \n2.  The funds at issue are awarded by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”)’s Office of \nJustice Programs (“OJP”), through its Office for Victims of Crime (“OVC”) and Bureau of Justice \nAssistance (“BJA”), and by DOJ’s Office on Violence against Women (“OVW”), which oversee \nvarious federal grants programs that provide States with resources needed to develop a full \necosystem  of  programs  and  services  that  support  access  to  justice.  OJP’s  mission  includes \nproviding  “federal  leadership,  funding,  and  other  critical  resources”  to  States  and  other \nbeneficiaries, in advancement of its greater goal of effecting justice and safety for all. OWV’s \nmission is to “provide federal leadership in developing the nation’s capacity to reduce violence \nagainst women and administer justice for and strengthen services to victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.” \n3.  Grantmaking is a key way that DOJ offices, including OJP and OVW, advance their \nmissions. For example, OJP administers grants authorized by the Victims of Crime Act (“VOCA”), \nwhich was passed over forty years ago to ensure the cooperation of victims and witnesses in \nreporting and testifying about crimes through the provision of services and support. VOCA funds \nboth emergency legal assistance (such as restraining and protective orders), and other legal \nassistance  associated  with  the  direct  result  of  victimization.  OVW  administers  programs \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 3 of 54 PageID #: 3\n \nauthorized by the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”), which provide resources strengthening \nvictim services in cases of crimes against women and others. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) program, administered by BJA, provides funds to support an \narray of programs designed to improve the criminal justice system, including to ensure adequate \nstaffing at public defenders’ offices, particularly in rural areas with insufficient labor pools.  \n4.  On August 18 of this year, Plaintiff States received surprise notices of a new \ncondition from OJP that would upend their practices, as well of those of their subgrantees, with \nrespect to the VOCA programs, the Byrne JAG program, and potentially a range of other OJP grant \nprograms. The new condition purported to restrict the use of grant funds to provide some legal \nservices for certain immigrants. Less than a month later, Defendants changed course, issuing a \nsuperseding policy on September 15, and incorporating that revised condition into the DOJ Grant \nFinancial Guide (the “DOJ Guide”), a document that provides guidance for a range of DOJ’s \ngrantees and subgrantees under OJP, OWV, and the Office of Community-Oriented Policing \nServices  (“COPS”).  In  adding  the  condition  to  the  DOJ  Guide,  Defendants  expanded  its \napplicability to additional grant programs beyond the two that had received the emailed notices—\nincluding, at least, the VAWA programs administered by OVW. \n5.  The condition as published in the DOJ Guide states that the “costs of providing \nlegal services (that is, professional services of the kind lawfully provided only by individuals \nlicensed to practice law) to any removable alien (see 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(2)) or any alien otherwise \nunlawfully present in the United States are disallowed and may not be charged against the award” \n(the “Legal Services Condition” or the “Condition”). The Condition also states that costs for the \nfollowing legal services are not disallowed: \n•  Orders of protection, “including associated or related orders (e.g., custody orders), \narising from the victimization;” \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 4 of 54 PageID #: 4\n \n•  Services associated with 18 U.S.C. ch. 77, relating to “peonage, slavery, and trafficking \nin persons;” \n•  Services to obtain T-visas, U-visas, or “‘continued presence’ immigration status (see, \ne.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T) & (U); 22 U.S.C. § 7105(c)(3)(A));” and, \n•  Services for which “disallowance would contravene any express requirement of any \nlaw, or of any judicial ruling, governing or applicable to the award.”  \n \n6.  Grantees that serve as passthroughs, such as Plaintiff States’ agencies tasked with \nsubgranting Defendants’ grants, appear to be required to monitor all subgrantees for compliance \nwith the Financial Guide’s terms and conditions, including the Legal Services Condition. This \nmonitoring  likely  includes  conducting  audits  for  certain  subrecipients,  as  well  as  ensuring \ncorrective actions are taken when needed, and other related measures. Defendants and their \nFinancial Guide have not made clear how Plaintiff States must determine subgrantees’ compliance \nwith the Legal Services Condition. \n7.  This Condition violates the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause in two ways. First, \nit is unconstitutionally retroactive because it applies to grants awarded before the Condition was \nissued, including “open” VOCA and Byrne JAG grants. Accordingly, Plaintiff States had no \nopportunity to consider this Condition before accepting their awards. Second, for all grants, it is \nambiguous as to (i) which particular legal services are restricted, (ii) which subset of immigrants \nare restricted from legal services, and (iii) how States are meant to determine which subset of \nimmigrants are to be restricted from accessing legal services. As a result, Plaintiff States and their \nsubgrantees are left to guess which services are covered for whom, and to guess which new \nprocesses may be required to comply with the Condition. If the Condition is construed to require \nverification of the immigration statuses of all clients before legal services can be offered, it is \nequally ambiguous as to how Plaintiff States would effectively enact compliance with this \nCondition and monitor subgrantee compliance as well. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 5 of 54 PageID #: 5\n \n8.  The  Condition  also  violates  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act’s  (“APA”) \nprohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action. Defendants have demonstrated no awareness \nof the change in position that the Legal Services Condition creates, and have offered no explanation \nfor the Condition, let alone a reasonable and well-reasoned one. Defendants, in including the \nCondition in the DOJ Guide, appear to have indicated an intent to apply it as an across-the-board \ncondition, with no consideration of the various statutory schemes and goals underlying the \nimpacted grant programs. Further, Defendants have failed to consider important aspects of the \nproblem they are ostensibly seeking to address, and have likewise failed to consider the significant \nharm to Plaintiff States administering these programs, and through subgrantees, to individuals \nneeding  legal  services.  They  have,  moreover,  demonstrated  no  consideration,  or  even \nunderstanding, of the reliance interests of the Plaintiff States in ensuring that services are available \nto individuals in accordance with the law, or the burden that the Condition will place on Plaintiff \nStates. The Condition is also arbitrary and capricious because it fails to explain how Plaintiff States \nare to interpret multiple ambiguities within the Condition itself. \n9.  Finally, with respect to VAWA and VOCA Victim Assistance, the Legal Services \nCondition is contrary to law because it is in direct conflict with governing regulations providing \nthat eligibility for services “is not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.” 28 C.F.R. \n§ 90.4(c) (for VAWA); 28 C.F.R. §§ 94.103, 94.116 (for VOCA Victim Assistance). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n10.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346. The Court has \nauthority to grant declaratory, injunctive, and other relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 and 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 702, 705, and 706. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 6 of 54 PageID #: 6\n \n11.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and 1391(e)(1). \nDefendants include a United States officer sued in her official capacity. The State of Rhode Island \nis a resident of this judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthis Complaint occurred within the District of Rhode Island. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n \n12.  Plaintiff the State of New York, represented by and through its Attorney General, \nLetitia James, is a sovereign state of the United States.

The VOCA programs \n43.  VOCA was passed in 1984 to provide resources and programming to meet the basic \nneeds and to affirm the dignity of victims and witnesses of crime, and their impacted families. \nVOCA created the Crime Victims Fund (the “Fund”), to “provide limited federal funding to the \nStates, with minimal bureaucratic ‘strings attached,’ for direct compensation and service programs \nto assist victims of crime.” S. Rep. No. 98-497, at 1, 3 (1984). The Fund is funded and replenished \nthrough various criminal fines and penalties, including those collected pursuant to deferred \nprosecution agreements, and other similar sources. 34 U.S.C. § 20101(b). The Fund in turn is used \nto support two formula grant programs: Victim Assistance and Victim Compensation.  \n44.  The VOCA programs are both administered by OJP, the largest grantmaking \ncomponent within the DOJ, through OVC. OJP provides funding and other resources to States and \nother eligible entities. Its mandate is to “advance[e] work that furthers DOJ’s mission to uphold \nthe  rule  of  law,  to  keep  our  country  safe,  and  protect  civil  rights.”  About  Us,  OJP, \nhttps://www.ojp.gov/about (last visited September 30, 2025). OJP’s budget for FY2024 was in \nexcess of five billion dollars.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 12 of 54 PageID #: 12\n \nVOCA Victim Assistance Formula Grants \n \n45.  The Victim Assistance Formula Grants, which constitute the majority of VOCA \nfunding that goes to States, are formula grants used by States to support subgrantees offering a \nrange of services and offer funding directly to victims and witnesses. 34 U.S.C. § 20103. \nSubgrantee organizations, which could be other public agencies, non-profits, or community-based \norganizations, provide a broad range of direct services under this grant.  \n46.  VOCA regulations establish the types of direct services provided by subgrantees \nthat are allowable under the Victim Assistance grant. These services include, among others, mental \nhealth  services,  victim  advocacy,  accompaniment  to  court  proceedings,  relocation  services, \nforensic medical examinations, and direct legal assistance. 28 C.F.R. § 94.119. VOCA regulations \nprovide that “emergency legal assistance,” including “obtaining emergency custody orders and \nvisitation rights,” are among the types of allowable costs under the Victim Assistance program. 28 \nC.F.R. § 94.119(a)(10). Under this provision, a subgrantee organization, for example, may use \nVOCA Victim Assistance funds to assist a victim in a legal action seeking an order of protection \nagainst their abuser or a legal proceeding in which a victim is seeking sole custody of their child \non an emergency basis in family court immediately after a domestic violence situation.  \n47.  VOCA and its implementing regulations confirm that a wide range of legal services \nand assistance are available for victims. The VOCA Victim Assistance regulations state that other, \nnon-emergency legal assistances are also allowable costs. 28 C.F.R. § 94.119(f). Additionally, in a \nfinal rule implementing the VOCA Victim Assistance formula grant program, OVC remarked that \n“States retain broad discretion to set limits on the type and scope of legal services that it allows its \nsub-recipients to provide with VOCA funding.” Victims of Crime Victim Assistance Program, 81 \nFed. Reg. 44515-01, 44524 (Jun. 8, 2016) (codified at 28 C.F.R. §§ 94.101-944.122) (the “Final \nRule”). This discretion reflects an understanding that “the available resources [for victims and \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 13 of 54 PageID #: 13\n \nwitnesses] in each State differ,” and therefore States are best positioned to make determinations \nabout how to allocate available VOCA Victim Assistance resources within a given state. Id.  \n48.  The Victim Assistance regulations specifically allow legal services “that help \nvictims assert their rights as victims in a criminal proceeding directly related to the victimization, \nor otherwise protect their safety, privacy, or other interests”; “motions to vacate or expunge a \nconviction”  directly  resulting  from  a  circumstance  where  that  victim  him/herself  has  been \nvictimized; or non-tort civil actions “reasonably necessary as a direct result of the victimization.” \n28 C.F.R. § 94.119(f). Under this provision, a subgrantee organization may provide a victim with, \nfor example, civil legal assistance in seeking a marital dissolution or child support, defending \nagainst holdover proceedings, legal intervention with creditors, or a range of other types of legal \nassistance resulting directly from an individual’s victimization.   \n49.  States, and their subgrantee organizations, rely on Victim Assistance funds to cover \nthe costs of this important work. In Fiscal Year 2024, VOCA funds supported 547,378 instances \nof services to assist victims, witnesses, and families with family law concerns alone. Office of \nJustice  Programs,  VOCA  Victim  Assistance  Data  Dashboard (2025), \nhttps://ovc.ojp.gov/funding/performance-measures/data-analyses/voca-victim-assistance \n[https://perma.cc/56PQ-MM7H] (last visited September 30, 2025).  \n50.  The work is far-reaching. For example, in New York, in 2024, nearly 900,000 \nindividuals received VOCA-funded assistance with various services categorized as “criminal and \ncivil justice system assistance,” which includes, among other things, a range of legal services, \nincluding representation in family law matters, assistance in development of victim impact \nstatements, and victim advocacy generally. More individuals received direct services related to \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 14 of 54 PageID #: 14\n \n“justice system assistance” in New York in 2024 under VOCA than for any other area of direct \nservices.  \n51.  Similarly, in Fiscal Year 2024, California subgrantees used Victim Assistance funds \nto serve 991,505 Californians. Those funds support various victim assistance efforts through 35 \nprograms, including subgrants to Victim Witness Assistance Centers at district attorney’s offices \nin each of California’s 58 counties, and to 98 non-government organizations throughout the state \nthrough the Domestic Violence Assistance Program. These programs provide various services \ncategorized as “criminal and civil justice system assistance,” which comprises the same range of \nlegal services discussed above. For Fiscal Year 2024, California subgrantees used VOCA Victim \nAssistance funds to assist victims and families 108,970 times in various civil legal matters. These \nare some examples of the large number of victims and witnesses served by Plaintiff States through \nsubgrantees using these funds.  \n52.  The use of VOCA funds to provide a range of legal assistance services to all victims, \nwitnesses, and their families is not novel or marginal, and is in fact a central feature of VOCA.  \nVOCA Victim Compensation Formula Grants \n53.  The  Victim  Compensation  Formula  Grants  are  VOCA  formula  grants  that \nreimburse victims and witnesses of crime, and their families, for a range of costs incurred as a \nresult of the crime, including medical care (e.g., sexual assault kit testing), counseling, burial, and \ncrime scene clean-up. The Victim Compensation program does not provide direct services to crime \nvictims, but instead reimburses them for often-overlooked costs that fall to victims, witnesses, and \ntheir families as an immediate result of crime. 34 U.S.C. § 20102. \n54.  The  statute  establishing  VOCA’s  Victim  Compensation  program  discusses \neligibility criteria for States’ compensation programs, and provides non-exclusive examples of the \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 15 of 54 PageID #: 15\n \nkinds of costs that may be reimbursable, including, for example, “medical expenses,” “mental \nhealth counseling and care,” “loss of wages,” and funeral expenses. 34 U.S.C. § 20102(b)(1). It \nalso  discusses  various  design  features  of  the  Victim  Compensation  program,  including \nrequirements that States’ programs “promote” cooperation between victims and law enforcement, \nthat States compensate nonresidents of the State when crimes occur within that state on an equal \nbasis as residents, and that States compensate victims of Federal crime on the same basis as victims \nof state crime.  \n55.  The statute imposes only one restriction on victim eligibility for reimbursement of \ncovered expenses, excluding “any person who has been convicted of an offense under Federal law \nwith respect to any time period during which the person is delinquent in paying a fine.” 34 U.S.C. § \n20102(b)(8). Beyond this exclusion, the statute is silent as to eligibility criteria for victims.1 \n56.  States  with  Victim  Compensation  programs  may  adopt  certain  state-specific \neligibility requirements for crime victims and witnesses seeking VOCA compensation. Plaintiff \nStates  do  not  have  immigration-related  eligibility  requirements  for  recipients  of  Victim \nCompensation funds. See, e.g., N.Y. Exec. Law § 624 (no immigration-related eligibility criteria \nfor Victim Compensation funds); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 52:4B-10 (detailing the requirements for \ncompensation in New Jersey). \n \n1 A separate statute, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act \nof 1996 (“PRWORA”), defines the term “federal public benefits” to exclude some nonqualified \naliens  from  certain  federally-funded  services.  OVC  has  affirmed  that  neither  of  VOCA’s \nprograms—Victim  Assistance  or  Victim  Compensation—are  federal  public  benefits  under \nPRWORA. Exhibit 1, Letter from Joye E. Frost, OVC Acting Director, to VOCA Administrators \n(June 28, 2010); Exhibit 2, Letter from Joye E. Frost, OVC Acting Director, to Cassie T. Jones, \nEd.D, Executive Director, Alabama Crime Victims’ Compensation Commission (July 2, 2010). \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 16 of 54 PageID #: 16\n \n57.  Among Plaintiff States’ Victim Compensation programs, some programs provide \nthat Victim Compensations funds may be used to reimburse attorneys’ fees. For example, under \nNew York law, some attorneys’ fees may be available to victims’ attorneys for representation in \nsuccessful appeals of Victim Compensation decisions. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Reg. tit. 9 § 525.9. \nBecause immigration status is not a criterion for access to Victim Compensation funds in New \nYork, these attorneys’ fees may go to victims and witnesses irrespective of immigration status.  \n58.  Under New Jersey law, Victim Compensation funds may be used to cover attorney’s \nfees and costs incurred in seeking compensation, as well as fees for legal assistance provided in \nother legal matters arising from the victimization. See N.J. Stat. Ann. § 52:4B-8; N.J. Admin. Code \n13:75-4.10. These attorney’s fees and costs are available irrespective of the victim’s immigration \nstatus. \n59.  Similarly, in Maryland, a victim may choose to be represented by an attorney at all \nstages of the claims process before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, a seven-member \nbody  with  a  full-time  staff  of  16  employees  that  receives  applications  for  VOCA  Victim \nCompensation funding, communicates with the victim and contacts claimants about the claims \nprocess to obtain missing information or documentation, determines whether the claim meets \nMaryland state statutory requirements for victim compensation awards, and awards or denied the \ncompensation requests. Md. Code Regs. § 12.01.01.10(A). An attorney may be compensated for a \ntotal sum of attorney fees and expenses, an amount that does not exceed the total of 20 percent of \nthe first $10,000 of an award, and 10 percent of the amount over $10,000. Md. Code Regs. § \n12.01.01.10(E)(7). Under Maryland law, the availability of an award of attorneys’ fees is not based \non the immigration status of the claimant. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 17 of 54 PageID #: 17\n \n60.  These uses of VOCA Victim Compensation funds are central to VOCA’s purpose, \nand, in Plaintiff States, are not restricted based on immigration status.   \nB.  The VAWA programs \n61.  OWV is the component of the DOJ which administers VAWA’s grant programs, \nincluding STOP and SASP.  OVW’s stated mission is to provide “federal leadership in developing \nthe nation’s capacity to reduce violence against women and administer justice for and strengthen \nservices to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.” Mission, \nOVW, https://www.justice.gov/ovw (last visited September 30, 2025).    \n62.  Passed in 1994, VAWA authorizes funding for community organizations to provide \nadvocacy and other services for survivors of domestic violence. Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, § 40121, 108 Stat. 1796, 1913 (1994) (codified as \namended at 34 U.S.C. § 10446). VAWA, which is administered by OVW, expressly contemplates \nfunding  “victim  services  and  legal  assistance  programs,  including  sexual  assault,  domestic \nviolence, dating violence, and stalking programs,” 34 U.S.C. § 10441(b)(5) (“Purpose Area 5”), \nincluding legal services directed toward “populations underserved because of” among other \nfactors, “alienage status.” 34 U.S.C. § 12291 (a)(46).  \n63.  Similar to VOCA, the VAWA program operates in large part through grants made \nto states and administered by state agencies, which then make subgrants to organizations providing \ndirect services on the ground to impacted survivors. 34 U.S.C. § 10446. The VAWA statute \nauthorizes a broad range of programs in support of the overarching goals of the VAWA program.  \n34 U.S.C. §§ 10441 et seq. Among VAWA’s main formula grants are the Services, Training, \nOfficers, and Prosecutors Formula Grant Program (“STOP”), 34 U.S.C. §§ 10441, 10446-51, \n10455, and the Sexual Assault Services Formula Grant Program (“SASP”), id. § 12511. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 18 of 54 PageID #: 18\n \n64.  The STOP program provides funds to States to support local communities in \ndeveloping resources needed, including among law enforcement and prosecutors, to respond to \nviolent crimes and to strengthen victim services. With STOP grant funds, for example, California \nhas been able to provide legal services to victims related to their assertion of employment rights, \nseeking debt relief, and addressing identity theft. New York has been able to provide legal services \nand  advocacy  related  to  obtaining  orders  of  protection;  family  court  matters;  and  civil \nrepresentation in the areas of consumer/finance, employment, income maintenance, housing, and \nimmigration matters. \n65.  The SASP program funds support States in providing intervention, advocacy, \naccompaniment, support services, and related assistance for, among others, victims of sexual \nassault, their family and household members, and those collaterally affected by the victimization. \nSee 34 U.S.C. § 12511. With SASP grant funds, for example, New York has been able to provide \nlegal services including civil legal advocacy and court accompaniment in both civil and \ncriminal courts. \n66.  VAWA specifically authorizes the use of grant funds to strengthen, enlarge, or \ndevelop  “victim  services  and  legal  assistance  programs  including  sexual  assault,  domestic \nviolence, dating violence, and stalking programs, developing or improving delivery of victim \nservices and legal assistance to underserved populations, providing specialized domestic violence \ncourt advocates in courts where a significant number of protection orders are granted, and \nincreasing reporting and reducing attrition rates for cases involving violent crimes against women, \nincluding crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.” 34 U.S.C. § \n10441 (b)(5) (emphasis added). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 19 of 54 PageID #: 19\n \n67.  Purpose Area 5 of the VAWA statute is clear that legal assistance is a contemplated \nand allowable purpose and use of funds in programs authorized under the statute, including legal \nservices for “underserved populations.” 34 U.S.C. § 10441(b)(5). The statute defines “underserved \npopulations” as “populations who face barriers in accessing and using victim services,” and \nincludes “populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, \nalienage status, or age).” 34 U.S.C. § 12291(a)(46). VAWA regulations additionally make clear \nthat “[v]ictim eligibility for direct services is not dependent on the victim's immigration status.” \n28 C.F.R. § 90.4(c).  \nC.  The Byrne JAG program \n68.  Byrne JAG is a formula grant program, administered by BJA, that provides funding \nfor criminal justice programming to State and local governments, as well to territories, tribes, and \ngovernmental agencies. The Byrne grant program is named after the late Officer Edward Byrne, a \nyoung New York City police officer who was felled in the line of duty while protecting an \nimmigrant witness. Joseph P. Fried, Officer Guarding Drug Witness is Slain, N.Y. Times, Feb. 27, \n1988, at A1.  \n69.  The Byrne JAG program was codified in its current form in 2006; its predecessor \nwas a federal block grant, authorized by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, \nwhich provided funding to State and local governments for law enforcement and criminal justice \nprograms. Pub. L. No. 90-351, Title I, 82 Stat. 197 (1968). In creating this block grant program, \nCongress found that “crime is essentially a local problem that must be dealt with by State and local \ngovernments if it is to be controlled effectively.” Id. The federal block grant program gave State \nand local governments wide latitude in the use of these funds. See Ely v. Velde, 451 F.2d 1130, \n1136 (4th Cir. 1971) (considering the 1968 Omnibus law and finding that the “dominant concern \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 20 of 54 PageID #: 20\n \nof Congress . . . was to guard against any tendency towards federalization of local police and law \nenforcement agencies” and that “[e]ven more important than Congress’ search for efficiency . . . \nwas its fear that overbroad federal control of state law enforcement could result in the creation of \nan Orwellian ‘federal police force’”). \n70.  In 2006, the Byrne JAG grant program was codified in its current form as a formula \ngrant to State and local entities. 34 U.S.C. §§ 10151-58. The purpose of the Byrne grant programs, \nconsistent with that of the Omnibus Act of 1968 from which the program originated, is to “make \ngrants to States and units of local government, for use by the State or unit of local government to \nprovide  additional  personnel,  equipment,  supplies,  contractual  support,  training,  technical \nassistance, and information systems for criminal justice or civil proceedings.” 34 U.S.C. § 10152. \nAmong the original allowable uses of these monies are “prosecution and court programs,” and \n“crime victim and witness programs.” 34 U.S.C. §§ 10152 (a)(1)(A)-(H). Furthermore, the general \nprovisions governing DOJ’s justice system improvement programs define “criminal justice” as  \nactivities pertaining to crime prevention, control, or reduction, or the enforcement \nof the criminal law, including, but not limited to, police efforts to prevent, control, \nor reduce crime or to apprehend criminals, including juveniles, activities of courts \nhaving criminal jurisdiction, and related agencies (including but not limited to \nprosecutorial and defender services, juvenile delinquency agencies and pretrial \nservice  or  release  agencies),  activities  of  corrections,  probation,  or  parole \nauthorities and related agencies assisting in the rehabilitation, supervision, and care \nof criminal offenders, and programs relating to the prevention, control, or reduction \nof narcotic addiction and juvenile delinquency.  \n \n34 U.S.C. § 10251(a)(1) (emphasis added). \n71.  Plaintiff State Illinois included support for public defense services as one of its \nseven Byrne JAG priority areas in its 2024-2029 Strategic Plan.  It set this as priority after criminal \njustice stakeholders identified that the lack of public defender staff hindered the entire criminal \njustice process, particularly in rural areas facing a smaller labor pool with climbing caseloads. In \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 21 of 54 PageID #: 21\n \nreliance on this plan, Illinois in 2025 subgranted a portion of its Byrne JAG funds directly to seven \npublic defender’s offices to ensure adequate staffing at courts facing a shortage of staff. Those \nawards open in October 2025.  \n72.  Similarly, for Plaintiff State Michigan, a portion of the State’s Byrne JAG grant \nfunds indigent defense services, including the State’s appellate defender office’s services in \npriority population drug courts. Michigan and its subgrantees currently do not screen participants \nin this program for immigration status. \n73.  Plaintiff State Washington seeks to increase the capacity of its local communities \nto respond to social problems and challenges, RCW 43.330.070, including by using federal grants \nto support community services, advocacy for low-income people, and public safety, see RCW \n43.330.050. Accordingly, Washington has used Byrne JAG funds to increase the capacity of \nsubgrantees to provide culturally-specific legal assistance to survivors of domestic and sexual \nviolence in order to close the “justice gap” these crime victims often experience when critical legal \nintervention is needed, as well as to increase the availability of survivor-centered pre-diversion \nand conviction relief programs. \n74.  Plaintiff State Oregon has sub-granted a portion of its Byrne JAG funds to an \norganization that provides free, open access legal services to Oregonians throughout the state. The \norganization will use Byrne JAG funds to hire a full-time attorney and full-time paralegal to \nprovide free, drop-in legal services on the nine federally recognized Oregon tribal reservations as \nwell as at six locations in rural Oregon. These legal services include, among other things, assistance \nwith criminal expungement. The organization does not currently screen recipients of these services \nbased on their immigration status.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 22 of 54 PageID #: 22\n \n75.  The Byrne JAG program is a leading source of federal justice funding to state and \nlocal jurisdictions, and the use of these funds for indigent defense and other legal services protects \nthe integrity of the criminal justice system. \nII.  Defendants issue the Legal Services Condition, an unlawful condition on grants past \nand future. \n \n76.  Over a series of communications in August and September 2025, Defendants DOJ \nand OJP purported to impose a condition on VOCA and Byrne JAG grants restricting the \navailability of legal services to individuals based on immigration status.  \n77.  On or about August 18, 2025, Plaintiff States received email notifications with the \nsubject line “Notice Regarding Unallowable Costs” from the OJP setting forth an initial version of \nthe condition. Exhibit 3 (Aug. 18, 2025 notification email to Plaintiff State New York). \n78.  Plaintiff State New York, for example, received a separate email with the subject \nline “Notice Regarding Unallowable Costs” for each of its “open” VOCA and Byrne grant \nawards—meaning grants for which the awarded funds in the corresponding year had not yet been \nfully expended, and were still being drawn upon by the State. The open grants2 for which New \nYork received these notifications included: \n•  VOCA Victim Assistance for Fiscal Years 2022, 2023, 2024 \n•  VOCA Victim Compensation for Fiscal Years 2023, 2024 \n•  Byrne JAG for Fiscal Years 2022, 2023, 2024 \n \n79.  Other Plaintiff States, similarly, received notices for each of their open VOCA \nVictim Assistance, VOCA Victim Compensation, and Byrne JAG awards. \n \n2 New York also received the same notifications for Byrne JAG awards for Fiscal Years \n2018-2021; the VOCA Victim Assistance award Fiscal Year 2021; and the VOCA Victim \nCompensation award for Fiscal Year 2022. These awards close October 1, 2025, though the \nremaining balances for the VOCA awards are available subject to a liquidation period. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 23 of 54 PageID #: 23\n \n80.  Apart from the reference to the grant name and number pursuant to which the \nPlaintiff States’ agencies received the notifications, the emails setting forth the new condition were \nidentical: \nEffective immediately upon receipt of this notice, any obligations of funds, at \nany tier, under this award to provide (or to support the provision of) legal \nservices to any removable alien or any alien otherwise unlawfully present in the \nUnited States shall be unallowable costs for purposes of this award, but the \nforegoing shall not be understood to apply—(1) to legal services to obtain \nprotection orders for victims of crime; or (2) to immigration-related legal \nservices that may be expressly authorized or required by any law, or any judicial \nruling, governing or applicable to the award. \n \n81.  On  or  about  September  15,  2025,  Plaintiff  States  received  another  emailed \nnotification from Defendants regarding the publication of the new DOJ Grants Financial Guide. \nExhibit 4 (Sep. 15, 2025 notification email to Plaintiff State New York). As with the August \nnotification, a separate email with the subject line “Notice Regarding Unallowable Costs Under \nthe Award (re: legal services to aliens)” went to each Plaintiff State for each open VOCA (Victim \nAssistance and Victim Compensation) and Byrne JAG grant. The emails, sent from OJP, included \na link to an online version of the September 2025 DOJ Guide, and stated that: \nThe notice entitled “Notice Regarding Unallowable Costs Under the Award” \nthat was sent on August 18, 2025 (which this notice supersedes), will be \nimplemented as specified in the DOJ Grants Financial Guide, in Chapter 3.13 \n“Unallowable Costs” (“Legal Services for Aliens”). As provided in the award \nitself,  compliance  with  the  DOJ  Grants  Financial  Guide  is  a  material \nrequirement of the award. The award requirement specified in the DOJ Grants \nFinancial Guide, in Chapter 3.13 “Unallowable Costs” (“Legal Services for \nAliens”) will be effective – and will be subject to enforcement under this \nFederal grant award from the Department of Justice – starting on October 31, \n2025. \n \n82.  Plaintiff States understand the “Legal Services for Aliens” section of the September \n2025 version of the DOJ Guide, as set forth through the emailed notifications, to be the final Legal \nServices Condition. DOJ Grants Financial Guide, https://www.ojp.gov/doj-financial-guide-2024 \n(last visited September 30, 2025) [https://perma.cc/HZ8K-CNPR]. The Condition states that: \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 24 of 54 PageID #: 24\n \nExcept as indicated in the following sentence, costs of providing legal services \n(that is, professional services of the kind lawfully provided only by individuals \nlicensed to practice law) to any removable alien (see 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(2)) or \nany alien otherwise unlawfully present in the United States are disallowed and \nmay not be charged against the award. \n \nCosts for legal services disallowed under the preceding sentence do not include \ncosts for legal services— (1) to obtain protection orders for victims of crime \n(including associated or related orders (e.g., custody orders), arising from the \nvictimization); (2) that are associated with or relate to actions under 18 U.S.C. \nch. 77 (peonage, slavery, and trafficking in persons); (3) to obtain T-visas, U-\nvisas,  or  “continued  presence”  immigration  status  (see,  e.g.,  8  U.S.C.  § \n1101(a)(15)(T) & (U); 22 U.S.C. § 7105(c)(3)(A)); or (4) as to which such \ndisallowance would contravene any express requirement of any law, or of any \njudicial ruling, governing or applicable to the award. \n \n83.  On or about September 17, 2025, Plaintiff States received notifications of their \nVOCA Fiscal Year 2025 Pre-Acceptance Award Packages (for both Victim Assistance and Victim \nCompensation). Among the conditions included in each package was the following reference to \nthe DOJ Guide:  \nCompliance with DOJ Grants Financial Guide \n \nReferences to the DOJ Grants Financial Guide are to the DOJ Grants Financial \nGuide as posted on the OJP website (currently, the “DOJ Grants Financial \nGuide” available at https://ojp.gov/financialguide/DOJ/index.htm), including \nany updated version that may be posted during the period of performance. The \nrecipient agrees to comply with the DOJ Grants Financial Guide. \n \n84.  Plaintiff States, having received award packages for VOCA Fiscal Year 2025 that \nincluded the above provision referencing the DOJ Guide, understand the Legal Services Condition \nto apply to these current grants, in addition to the past-awarded “open” grants for which they \nreceived emailed notifications.  \n85.  Plaintiff States received VAWA 2025 award packages from OVW in the middle of \nAugust 2025. These packages included the following condition, which references the DOJ Guide:  \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 25 of 54 PageID #: 25\n \nApplicability of Part 200 Uniform Requirements and DOJ Grants Financial \nGuide \n \nThe recipient agrees to comply with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, \nCost Principles, and Audit Requirements in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, as adopted and \nsupplemented by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2 C.F.R. Part 2800 \n(together, the “Part 200 Uniform Requirements”), and the current edition of the \nDOJ Grants Financial Guide as posted on the OVW website, including any \nupdated version that may be posted during the period of performance. The \nrecipient also agrees that all financial records pertinent to this award, including \nthe general accounting ledger and all supporting documents, are subject to \nagency review throughout the life of the award, during the close-out process, \nand for three years after submission of the final Federal Financial Report (SF-\n425) or as long as the records are retained, whichever is longer, pursuant to 2 \nC.F.R. 200.334, 200.337. \n \n86.  Based on the inclusion of the reference to the DOJ Guide, and in particular the \nlanguage indicating that grantees are to comply with “the current edition of the DOJ Grants \nFinancial Guide as posted on the OVW website, including any updated version that may be posted \nduring the period of performance,” Plaintiff States understand the Legal Services Condition to be \napplicable to VAWA 2025 awards.  \n87.  Moreover, because past years’ VAWA awards, upon information and belief, also \ncontained similar language requiring compliance with any updated versions of the DOJ Guide \nposted during the period of performance, Plaintiff States understand the Legal Services Condition \nto be appliable to all open VAWA awards. \n88.  Beyond VOCA, VAWA, and Byrne JAG awards, in including the Condition in the \nDOJ Guide, Defendants appear to seek to impose it across-the-board. The manual acknowledges \nthat “there may be instances where the requirements may differ among” the three main grant-\nmaking components within DOJ that use the DOJ Guide ((1) OJP, (2) OVW, and (3) COPS). \nUltimately, however, nearly all DOJ grants seem to require compliance with the DOJ Guide, and \nany  updates  thereto  that  arise  during  grants’  performance  periods.  Moreover,  on  or  about \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 26 of 54 PageID #: 26\n \nSeptember  30,  2025,  Plaintiff  States  received  an  additional  emailed  notification  from  OJP \nannouncing the inclusion of the Legal Services Condition in the DOJ Guide, and reiterating the \nGuide’s applicability to all three grant-making components. Exhibit 5 (Sep. 30, 2025 notification \nemail to Plaintiff State New York). In including the Legal Services Condition in a DOJ manual \nthat is common to grants across all three components, Defendants appear to seek a categorial \napplication of the Legal Services Condition across all grants administered by these offices.  \n89.  Plaintiff States are subject to the Legal Services Condition as both direct grantees \nand  as  pass-through  entities  that  provide  subawards  to  subrecipients  (also  known  as \n“subgrantees”). Examples of subrecipients include local government entities and community-\nbased organizations that contribute to the objectives of the Federal award. As pass-through entities, \nPlaintiff States are required, by federal regulation and by the DOJ Guide, to “[m]onitor the \nactivities of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subrecipient complies with Federal \nstatutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.332(e); DOJ \nGrants Financial Guide § 3.14. These monitoring obligations include conducting audits for certain \nsubrecipients, reviewing financial and performance reports, reviewing financial operations and \nactivities, ensuring corrective actions are taken when needed, and other related measures. See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.332(e); DOJ Grants Financial Guide § 3.14 at 107-09. The DOJ Guide also provides: \n“Where the conduct of a program or one of its components is delegated to a subrecipient, the direct \nrecipient is responsible for all aspects of the program including proper accounting and financial \nrecordkeeping by the subrecipient.” DOJ Grants Financial Guide § 3.14 at 110. \n90.  The DOJ Guide does not provide any specific guidance regarding how pass-through \nentities should monitor subrecipient compliance with the Legal Services Condition which, in turn, \nexposes Plaintiff States to a heightened risk of funding loss should a subgrantee fall short of \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 27 of 54 PageID #: 27\n \ncomplying  with  Defendants’  interpretation  of  the  Legal  Services  Condition  or  should  a \npassthrough fall short of meeting Defendants’ ambiguous compliance expectations. \nIII.   The Legal Services Condition violates both the Constitution and the Administrative \nProcedure Act. \n91.  Imposing  the  Legal  Services  Condition  (as  set  forth  in  the  DOJ  Guide  and \nimplemented through the emailed notices) on any “open” grants awarded prior to 2025 violates \nthe Spending Clause’s prohibition against retroactive, post-acceptance conditions.  \n92.  The Legal Services Condition, as set forth in the DOJ Guide, is also ambiguous in \nviolation of the Spending Clause; arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; and, as to VAWA \nand VOCA Victim Assistance grants, contrary to law in violation of the APA. \nA.  The Legal Services Condition is a retroactive and ambiguous condition in violation of \nthe Spending Clause. \n \na.  As to all “open” awards, the condition is retroactive. \n93.  The  Legal  Services  Condition  purports  to  apply  to  each  grant  for  which  a \nnotification of the same was received via email in August and September of this year. Many of \nthese “open” grants were awarded to States years ago and have been drawn from since then. \nThrough its inclusion in the DOJ Guide, it may also apply to various other open DOJ grants that \ndid not receive emailed notifications, but that remain open and subject to broad conditions \nrequiring  compliance  with  all  future  versions  of  the  DOJ  Guide  issued  during  a  grant’s \nperformance period.   \n94.  Under VOCA, the “award period” of a given year’s grant is that year, plus the three \nsubsequent years.  34 U.S.C. § 20101(e). At the end of that four-year period, States may seek an \nextension from the Attorney General to continue to spend that award down. Practically speaking, \nthis means that an award period for a FY 2021 VOCA grant would be FY 2021 through FY 2024. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 28 of 54 PageID #: 28\n \nIf all of the funds from FY 2021 were not spent by the conclusion of FY 2024, a grantee State \ncould seek, from the Attorney General, an extension for the use of those funds. Id. Because of how \nthe statute defines VOCA’s award period, the Legal Services Condition imposes the new policy on \nfunds years after they were awarded and accepted, and years after States made subgrantee awards \nbased on the terms and conditions in effect at the time of acceptance.  \n95.  The performance period of a Byrne JAG award is typically four years, meaning that \nthe award remains open for a four-year period, subject to extension at the discretion of DOJ. Any \nprogram activities supported by the awarded funds must be completed within the time the award \nremains open. After the award closes, any remaining unpaid obligations from such program \nactivities must be paid within 120 days of the close date.  \n96.  The Spending Clause prohibits the imposition of post-acceptance conditions on \ngrants. While the government can impose conditions on federal funds, this authority does “not \ninclude surprising participating States with post acceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp’l v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 25 (1981). Yet this is precisely what Defendants \nhave done. As established by the emailed notifications received by Plaintiff States, Defendants \nintend for the Condition to apply to at least all open VOCA and Byrne JAG awards, and potentially \nto other open awards (such as VAWA), attempting to change the conditions of these awards \nmidstream, in violation of Pennhurst. Officials in Plaintiff States making acceptance decisions \nwith respect to these past grants could not have known the obligations that would be imposed years \nafter the States accepted the grants. \n97.  Defendants’ attempt to impose the Condition retroactively on grants awarded and \naccepted years before the emailed notifications is an axiomatic violation of the Spending Clause’s \nprohibition on retroactive, post-acceptance conditions.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 29 of 54 PageID #: 29\n \nb.  The Condition is ambiguous in violation of the Spending Clause. \n98.  Moreover,  the  Spending  Clause  disallows  conditions,  like  the  Legal  Services \nCondition, that are ambiguous. The “legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the spending \npower . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms” of the grant \nbefore it, and “[t]here can . . . be no knowing acceptance if a State is unaware of the conditions or \nis unable to ascertain what is expected of it. Accordingly, if Congress intends to impose a condition \non the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp’l, 451 \nU.S. at 17 (emphasis added).  \n99.  In determining whether a condition in a federal fund is “ambiguous” for the \npurposes of the Spending Clause, courts must view the condition “from the perspective of a state \nofficial who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the State should accept [the funds] and \nthe obligations that go with those funds.” Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 \nU.S. 291, 296 (2006).  \n100.  The officials tasked with implementing these awards for Plaintiff States cannot \nreasonably discern the contours of the newly imposed Legal Services Condition, which are unclear \nand ambiguous in three key respects. First, the conduct targeted by the Condition is unclear. \nSecond, the language regarding which “aliens” are to be excluded is unclear. Third, the Condition \nis unclear as to what conduct is required of Plaintiff States in order to comply, and how they are \nexpected to ensure subgrantees’ compliance. \ni.  The conduct targeted by the Legal Services Condition is unclear. \n101.  The Legal Services Condition includes, among others, exceptions for costs for legal \nservices (i) “to obtain protection orders for victims of crime (including associated or related orders \n(e.g., custody orders), arising from the victimization),” and (ii) “as to which [the] disallowance \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 30 of 54 PageID #: 30\n \nwould contravene any express requirement of any law, or of any judicial ruling, governing or \napplicable to the award.” From this language, it is not clear which legal services would be deemed \nto be “associated or related orders” or an “express requirement of any law, or of any judicial \nruling,” and therefore not an unallowable cost as to the excluded group of individuals. The \nexceptions are unclear and ambiguous.  \n102.  First, although legal services to obtain “orders” that are “associated or related” to \nprotection orders are exempt, it is not clear what an “associated or related” order must be for the \nlegal services necessary to secure it to be an allowable cost. For instance, in this context, \n“associated or related” could mean additional non-emergency orders related to orders of protection \nand custody (e.g., ongoing final custody proceedings stemming from the victimization, but \noccurring months or even years later). It could also mean additional emergency orders related to \ncontexts beyond criminal or family court (e.g., emergency housing orders). As a result, the full \nscope of legal services that fall under the “associated or related orders” exception is unclear. \n103.  Second, the exception concerning legal services “as to which disallowance would \ncontravene any express requirement of any law, or of any judicial ruling” is also ambiguous. \nDefendants have provided guidance concerning neither which “laws” are subject to the exception, \nnor  what  constitutes  an  “express  requirement.”  In  the  context  of  VOCA  and  VAWA,  this \nuncertainty is acutely problematic.   \n104.  In the VOCA context, where Defendants’ own regulations provide a broad (but non-\nexhaustive) list of legal services that are “[a]llowable direct service costs,” see 28 C.F.R. §§ \n94.119(a)(10), (f), eligibility is similarly “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status,” id. § \n94.116. In promulgating the VOCA regulations, Defendants provided numerous other examples, \n“which are merely illustrative, and not meant to be a comprehensive listing,” of allowable legal \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 31 of 54 PageID #: 31\n \nservices that “may be appropriate,” including, among other civil legal services, “intervention with \ncreditors, law enforcement (e.g., to obtain police reports), and other entities on behalf of victims \nof identity theft and financial fraud” (which may be relevant in instances of domestic violence \ncoupled with financial coercion), and campus administrative stay-away orders. See 81 Fed. Reg. \n44515-01, 44524 (Jun. 8, 2016). DOJ previously explained that it intentionally left the scope of \nallowable direct services so broad because States are best positioned to make a reasoned judgment, \nbased on experience and local context, as to which legal services will best serve crime victims. See \nid. (providing that “States retain broad discretion to set limits on the type and scope of legal \nservices that it allows its sub-recipients to provide with VOCA funding” and recognizing that “the \navailable resources [for victims and witnesses] in each State differ”).  \n105.  The VAWA statute and regulations are similarly clear that a broad scope of legal \nservices are considered allowable costs. The statute itself defines “legal assistance” as “assistance \nprovided . . . to an adult, youth, or child victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault,  or  stalking,  relating  to,”  inter  alia,  “divorce,  parental  rights,  child  support, Tribal, \nterritorial,  immigration,  employment,  administrative  agency,  housing,  campus,  education, \nhealthcare, privacy, contract, consumer, civil rights, protection or other injunctive proceedings, \nrelated enforcement proceedings, and other similar matters.” 34 U.S.C. § 12291(a)(24). See also \n34  U.S.C.  §  12291(a)(51)  (defining  “victim  services”  and  “services”  to  include  \n“legal assistance and legal advocacy”); 34 U.S.C. § 10441(b)(10) (allowing VAWA STOP grant \nmonies to be used for “assistance to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in immigration \nmatters.”). While the statute lists a number of forms of legal services that are contemplated, they \nare clearly not to be considered a closed and exhaustive list, allowing legal assistance for “other \nsimilar matters.” \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 32 of 54 PageID #: 32\n \n106.  VAWA regulations also contemplate a range of legal services that are allowable for \nvictims and survivors, including “legal services programs.”  28 C.F.R. § 90.17(a). Finally, VAWA \nregulations clearly provide that “[v]ictim eligibility for direct services is not dependent on the \nvictim’s immigration status.” 28 C.F.R. § 90.4(c). \n107.  Defendants’ Legal Services Condition makes no mention of VOCA and VAWA’s \nextensive statutory and regulatory provisions regarding the allowability of many kinds of legal \nservices to victims irrespective of immigration status, even though these provisions appear to \ndirectly contradict the Condition. Defendants’ lack of acknowledgment, let alone explanation, for \nthis apparent irreconcilable conflict between these statutes and regulations, and the Condition—\nwhich Defendants sent and purport to apply to recipients of both awards—strongly suggests that \nDefendants may not consider the statutes or their own regulations, to contain a sufficiently \n“express requirement of . . . law,” to satisfy the Condition’s exception.  \n108.  Defendants’ Legal Services Condition could be interpreted to create an end-run \naround these laws and regulations, simply because each and every type of legal services cost \nconceivably related to a person’s victimization is not listed in the relevant provisions, and therefore \nmay not be considered “express.” Moreover, for VOCA, such an interpretation would be a \nviolation of the regulations and run afoul of the reasoning provided in the Final Rule, which itself \nprovides an even larger non-exhaustive list of examples of allowable costs. It is unclear from the \nlanguage of the Condition whether these types of legal services, clearly considered in the Final \nRule and intended to be among the types of costs that States could allow under 28 C.F.R. § \n94.119(f), are exempted under the Condition as “express” requirements of law, or will now be \nconsidered unallowable by Defendants. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 33 of 54 PageID #: 33\n \n109.  The “express requirement of any law” exception also creates ambiguity with respect \nto legal services funded through Plaintiff States’ Byrne JAG awards. The Byrne JAG statutes \nexpressly permit the use of funding for “personnel” for “criminal justice . . . proceedings,” 34 \nU.S.C. § 10152(a)(1), which includes public “defender services,” id. § 10251(a)(1). Even though \nCongress surely understood when drafting that provision that—consistent with the Constitution’s \nguarantee that criminal defendants have a right to counsel—public defenders represent clients \nregardless of their immigration status, the statute does not expressly provide that defender services \nshall be offered without regard to immigration status. See id. § 10152(a)(1). It is unclear, however, \nwhether this statutory authorization—which does not impose any restriction based on immigration \nstatus—provides a sufficiently “express requirement” such that Plaintiff States may continue \nfunding the cost of legal services, like defender services, with their Byrne JAG awards. \nii.  The set of individuals to be excluded by the Legal Services Condition is \nunclear.  \n \n110.  The Legal Services Condition is also unclear as to which individuals are meant to \nbe excluded from legal services under its restrictions. The Condition states that such services may \nnot be provided to a “removable alien (see 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(2)) or any alien otherwise \nunlawfully present.” But the determination of whether a person is “removable” under 8 U.S.C. § \n1229a(e)(2), or “otherwise unlawfully present”3 requires a complex inquiry—one that immigration \njudges or adjudicators may take years to decide in administrative proceedings. Moreover, the \nconstruction of the exception itself creates ambiguity: the Condition seems to imply that anyone \nwho is “removable” is also “unlawfully present.” But that is not the case. For example, a lawful \n \n3 “Unlawfully present” is not explained or defined in the Condition or the DOJ Guide, \nthough  it  is  a  term  that  exists  in  the  INA  as  a  ground  of  inadmissibility,  see  8  U.S.C.  § \n1182(a)(9)(B), with its own set of complex provisions and exceptions. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 34 of 54 PageID #: 34\n \npermanent resident can be “removable” under § 1229a(e)(2) without ever having a period of \n“unlawful presence.”   \n111.  There is no indication that Defendants, in issuing the Legal Services Condition, \nconsidered either the complexity of making such a judgment, or the detailed inquiry needed to \nreach a conclusion on this question. This is not to say that every assessment of whether a person’s \nimmigration status renders them eligible for a federal program requires a state agency to await the \ndisposition of an administrative proceeding that may take years. Rather, the ambiguity lies in the \nfact that the Condition’s language is unique and ambiguous, incorporates complex immigration \nlaw terms, and is not elucidated by any guidance that provides a structure or process for making \nthis assessment.  \niii.  The method for determining excluded individuals under the Legal Services \nCondition is unclear. \n \n112.  Relatedly, the Legal Services Condition is ambiguous because it provides no \nguidance as to how recipients should identify individuals to whom allowable legal services can no \nlonger be provided. For example, it is not clear whether the Condition places an affirmative \nresponsibility on Plaintiff States (or their subgrantees) to develop protocols to screen individuals \nby immigration status before providing legal services to them, whether the Condition instead \nexpects Plaintiff States to entirely sever ties with subgrantees that primarily serve populations that \nmay include noncitizens who are removable or unlawfully present, or whether the Condition \nrequires Plaintiff States (and their subgrantees) to withhold services only to individuals whom they \nknow to be removable or unlawfully present. Under the Legal Services Condition, Plaintiff States \nare left with considerable uncertainty regarding a question that is fundamental to how their \noperations, and those of their subgrantees, will need to work.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 35 of 54 PageID #: 35\n \n113.  By contrast, for example, the Medicaid program, for which citizenship or certain \nimmigration status is statutorily required for eligibility, provides a host of detailed regulations as \nto which categories of non-citizens are eligible, for which parts of the Medicaid program, and \npursuant to which forms of proof. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1641(b), (c) (defining “qualified alien” for the \npurposes  of  Federal  public  benefits);  8  U.S.C.  §  1611(b)(1)(A)  (creating  an  exemption  for \neligibility requirements in emergency and similar circumstances); 42 C.F.R. § 435.910 (providing \nguidance as to use of Social Security numbers in eligibility verification). Unlike the Medicaid \ncontext,  where  clear  consideration  was  given  to  both  the  immigration-related  eligibility \nrequirements and the operationalizing of these requirements, the Legal Services Condition merely \nprovides that it applies to legal services for “removable alien[s] (see 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(2)) or \nany alien[s] otherwise unlawfully present,” and leaves Plaintiff States and subgrantees to make \ntheir best guesses as to the proper ways to make these determinations—ones that they have never \nhad to make before in this context.4 \n114.  For all of the foregoing reasons the Legal Services condition is unclear and \nambiguous in violation of the Spending Clause. \nB.  The Legal Services Condition is arbitrary and capricious. \n \n115.  The Condition is also arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative \nProcedure Act. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(a). An “arbitrary and capricious” agency action is one that is \nneither “reasonable [nor] reasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, \n423 (2021). Agencies must provide a “satisfactory explanation” for their actions, and this must \n \n4 In fact, as to VOCA, the only guidance that the regulations do contain as to immigration, \nis guidance that plainly states that, for both States and subgrantees, “victim eligibility . . . for direct \nservices is not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.” 28 C.F.R. § 94.103(a); see also 28 \nC.F.R. § 94.116. In the VAWA context, the regulations are equally clear that “[v]ictim eligibility \nfor direct services is not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.” 28 C.F.R. § 90.4(c). \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 36 of 54 PageID #: 36\n \ninclude a “rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \n116.  First, Defendants have provided no reasoning whatsoever when issuing the Legal \nServices Condition, much less reasoning that draws any connection between facts found and \nchoices made. The only correspondence that Plaintiff States have received with respect to the \nCondition are the August and September emails, the latter of which references and links to the \nDOJ Guide. With respect to the Condition, the DOJ Guide provides no more than the language of \nthe Condition itself. No further explanation, guidance, reference, or authority is provided to \ndemonstrate a relationship between Defendants’ findings and a resulting decision to impose the \nLegal Services Condition.  \n117.  Second, the Condition changes Defendants’ longstanding position that access to \nlegal  services  under  these  OJP  and  OVW  grants  is  not  a  function  of  immigration  status. \nDefendants’ “[s]udden and unexplained change” represented by the Condition “does not take \naccount of legitimate reliance on prior interpretation[s]” held by Plaintiff States. Smiley v. Citibank \n(South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996). It is “arbitrary and capricious” to not consider \n“longstanding policies [that] may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken \ninto account.” DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (internal quotations \nomitted).   \n118.  Third, in including the Legal Services Condition into the DOJ Guide, Defendants \nappear to seek to apply this condition across-the-board to all DOJ grants. Defendants have not \nexplained the appropriateness of a categorial application of the Condition, nor is there any \nindication  that  they  have  considered  the  various,  complex  statutory  schema  and  purposes \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 37 of 54 PageID #: 37\n \nunderlying each of the distinct grant programs at issue. An agency simply cannot impose grant \nconditions without first ensuring that the relevant statute supports them. See New York v. Trump, \n769 F. Supp. 3d 119, 142 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025) (agencies acted arbitrarily and capriciously by \nfailing to consider whether action “fell within the bounds of their statutory authority”), appeal \ndocketed, No. 25-1236 (1st Cir. Mar. 10, 2025); see also, e.g., City of Providence v. Barr, 954 F.3d \n23, 31 (1st Cir. 2020) (concluding that DOJ lacked statutory authority to impose immigration \nenforcement conditions on Byrne JAG grants). Here, in imposing a blanket Condition across a \nbroad set of federal grants, there is no indication that Defendants have conducted an inquiry into \nwhether the Legal Services Condition is consistent with the statutory authority underlying each \ngrant program. Defendants have pointed to no authority demonstrating that Congress intended for \nthe agency and offices implementing these programs to condition an individual’s access to these \nprograms on that person’s immigration status. Defendants have thus “relied on factors which \nCongress has not intended it to consider.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, Inc., 463 U.S. at 43. \n119.  Fourth, the Condition is arbitrary and capricious because Defendants “entirely \nfailed to consider an important aspect of the problem.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, Inc., 463 U.S. \nat 43. In their overnight change to the longstanding grant conditions allowing these services \nregardless of immigration status, Defendants have failed to consider that, imposing this new \nimmigration-related condition may run afoul of the core purposes of these grant programs—\nparticularly the VOCA and VAWA programs, which are premised on the principle that all victims \nshould be enabled to  participate in the criminal matters underlying their own victimization, on an \nequal basis and without fear of adverse consequences. This is a matter of both victims’ dignity and \npublic safety. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 38 of 54 PageID #: 38\n \n120.  Defendants have also failed to consider that, in some Plaintiff States, state laws and \npolicies prohibit public officers from requesting immigration-related information from individuals \nwithout a legally required basis for the request. For example, New York’s Executive Order 170 \nestablishes that no “State officers . . . shall inquire about an individual’s immigration status unless \n. . . the status of such individual is necessary to determine his or her eligibility for a program, \nbenefit, or the provision of a service.” New York Exec. Order 170 (Sept. 15, 2017). Because, for \nexample, the VOCA regulations are clear that an individual’s immigration status is not relevant to \ntheir eligibility for VOCA services, New York’s agency administering VOCA subgrants, the Office \nof Victim Services, could not lawfully make such a request to a person seeking services under \nVOCA services. The same is true for the Division of Criminal Justice Services, New York’s \nVAWA-administering agency. \n121.  Other Plaintiff States have similar policies. In Colorado, for example, State and \nlocal subdivision employees are prohibited from requesting certain personal information, except \nas required by state or federal law, as necessary to perform their duties, or to verify eligibility for \ncertain federal benefits. C.R.S. § 24-74-104. See also ORS 181A.823(1)(b) (Oregon); Cal. Gov. \nCode Sec. 12900 et seq. (California). \n122.  Because the regulations are equally clear that immigration status is not an eligibility \nfactor for VOCA Assistance or VAWA services provided by subgrantees, see 28 C.F.R. § 94.103(a); \n28 C.F.R. § 94.116; see also 28 C.F.R. § 90.4(c), there is similarly no reason for them to have \ndeveloped any staffing, training, or procedures to screen victims’ or witnesses’ immigration \nstatuses before providing VOCA Assistance or VAWA-funded services. Nor have any recipients of \nByrne JAG funding for court programming and defense services had any reason to develop the \nstaffing, training, or procedures necessary to request or, if required, screen for immigration status. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 39 of 54 PageID #: 39\n \n123.  Fifth, and relatedly, Defendants have failed to consider the substantial reliance \ninterest of Plaintiff States on their existing systems and infrastructures around administering and \nmonitoring these federal grants—none of which has, before the Condition, needed or included any \nsort of immigration verification. “When an agency changes course, . . . it must be cognizant that \nlongstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into \naccount.” DHS, 591 U.S. at 30 (internal citation omitted). There is no indication that Defendants, \nprior to issuing the Legal Services Condition, analyzed or understood that identifying “any \nremovable alien or any alien otherwise unlawfully present in the United States” is an entirely \ndistinct task from anything that Plaintiff State agencies already do in the regular course of their \nwork. \n124.  As discussed, supra, the process of verifying whether someone is “removable” or \n“unlawfully present” is not a simple inquiry, and requires expertise, training, and systems that \nPlaintiff States’ agencies generally do not have. Other federal programs for which immigration \nstatus is a statutorily required eligibility factor provide guidance to States as to how to feasibly \nmake such an assessment within the program’s operations. See e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1641(b), (c) (under \nMedicaid, defining “qualified alien” for the purposes of Federal public benefits); 8 U.S.C. § \n1611(b)(1)(A) (creating an exemption for eligibility requirements in emergency and similar \ncircumstances for Medicaid); 42 C.F.R. § 435.910 (providing guidance as to use of Social Security \nnumbers in Medicaid eligibility verification). In this instance, Defendants have provided nothing \nof the sort, nor have they indicated any plans to do so. \n125.  This omission is substantial. For example, if the Legal Services Condition were \nread to require states and subgrantees to affirmatively screen individuals for immigration status, \nPlaintiff States’ VOCA-, VAWA-, and Byrne JAG-administering agencies (and their subgrantees) \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 40 of 54 PageID #: 40\n \nwould  need  considerable  additional  resources—including  specialized  immigration-related \nexpertise and appropriate verification systems—to be able to oversee subgrantee compliance with \nthe Legal Services Condition. Indeed, the DOJ Guide and applicable regulations require such \nmonitoring (though without any guidance as to monitoring of this particular condition). See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.332(e); DOJ Grants Financial Guide § 3.14. State agencies may also need to change \ntheir operating models to accommodate the Condition’s immigration verification requirement.  \n126.  Furthermore, the transformation potentially required of Plaintiff States’ agencies \nwould be particularly significant in the VOCA and VAWA contexts, where individuals seeking \nservices are enmeshed with highly sensitive matters related to crime, safety, and domestic abuse. \nOftentimes, a crime victim who is fleeing an abusive situation—irrespective of that person’s \nimmigration or citizenship status—will not physically possess the legal documents they may need \nin order to demonstrate their immigration status. It is well-documented that an abuser restricting a \nvictim’s access to their important legal documents is a common manifestation of coercion, control, \nand domestic abuse. See e.g. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 7.105.010 (enumerating forms of “coercive \ncontrol” for purposes of domestic violence protective orders, including “[e]xerting control over \nthe other party’s identity documents”); Elizabeth Hopper, Ph.D. & José Hidalgo, M.D., Invisible \nChains: Psychological Coercion of Human Trafficking Victims, 1 Intercultural Hum. Rts. L. Rev. \n185, 198 (2006). \n127.  Imposing  what  may  essentially  be  an  affirmative  requirement  that  victims \ndemonstrate that they are not “removable” or “otherwise unlawfully present” in order to be eligible \nfor  VOCA-  or  VAWA-funded  legal  services  would  also  foreseeably  impact  many  victims, \nincluding citizens, for whom the reality of recent proximity to crime may make it dangerous, or \neven impossible, to gather and present legal documentation of status before acutely needing \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 41 of 54 PageID #: 41\n \nservices. There is no indication that this is an outcome that Congress intended for these grant \nprograms, and Defendants may not override Congress’s reasoned judgment through an e-mail or \nan update to the DOJ Grants Financial Guide.  \n128.  Sixth, the ambiguities inherent in the Legal Services Condition, as discussed, see \nsupra Part III (A)(b), also independently render it arbitrary and capricious insofar as it fails to \nexplain how the Plaintiff States should interpret the multiple ambiguities that Plaintiff States would \nneed to resolve to determine how to comply, and how to monitor compliance.  \n129.  Finally, the Legal Services condition is arbitrary and capricious because it purports \nto apply retroactively to previously awarded grants. Defendants have provided no reasoned \nexplanation for the application of the Condition retroactively. See Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. \n632, 638 (1985) (applicable federal grants terms are based on “the law in effect when the grants \nwere made,” not retroactive changes in substantive requirements made after). \nC.  As to VAWA and VOCA Victim Assistance, the Legal Services Condition is contrary \nto law. \n \n130.  VAWA was passed to address the “escalating problem of violence against women” \nand “to remedy not only the violent effects of the problem, but the subtle prejudices that lurk \nbehind it.” S. Rep. 103-138, 37, 42 (1993); Pub. L. No. 103-322, tit. IV, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994). \nConsistent with this, the VAWA statute and regulations make clear, in multiple places, that legal \nservices are to be construed broadly and that immigration status is not an eligibility criterion for \naccess to such services. At the outset, the statute defines “legal assistance” to include assistance in \nimmigration matters. 34 U.S.C. § 12291(a)(24). The same provision lists many illustrative types \nof legal services that States and subgrantees may provide to victims under VAWA, including \nconsumer  matters,  contract  matters,  immigration  matters,  and  many  more.  34  U.S.C.  § \n12291(a)(24)(C)(i). \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 42 of 54 PageID #: 42\n \n131.  Elsewhere in the statute, VAWA’s STOP grant program expressly contemplates \nfunding  “victim  services  and  legal  assistance  programs,  including  sexual  assault,  domestic \nviolence, dating violence, and stalking programs,” 34 U.S.C. § 10441(b)(5), including legal \nservices aimed at “populations underserved because of,” among other factors, “alienage status.” \n34  U.S.C.  §  12291(a)(46).  Consistent  with  this, VAWA  regulations  are  clear  that  “[v]ictim \neligibility under this program for direct services is not dependent on the victim’s immigration \nstatus.” 28 CFR § 90.4(c). \n132.  An original purpose of the VOCA program was to support inadequately funded \nstate and local victim assistance programs “with minimal bureaucratic ‘strings attached,’ for … \nservice programs to assist victims of crime.” S. Rep. No. 98-497, at 1, 3 (1984). Other purposes \nwere “to encourage states to provide assistance to victims of crime within their borders regardless \nof the victim’s residence,” and to “create a safe and welcome environment for victims who will be \ninvolved in the criminal justice system.” Id. at 5.  \n133.  Consistent  with  these  stated  purposes,  the VOCA Victim Assistance  program \nprohibits  restricting  victims’  and  witnesses’  access  to  program-provided  services  based  on \nimmigration status. The regulations state plainly that “[v]ictim eligibility under this program for \ndirect services is not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.” 28 C.F.R. § 94.103(a). This \nmandate is significant enough to VOCA’s Victim Assistance program that the regulations restate \nidentical language in the section, this time directed towards subgrantees specifically: As to \nsubgrantees, “[v]ictim eligibility under this program for direct services is not dependent on the \nvictim’s immigration status.” 28 C.F.R. § 94.116. \n134.  The Legal Services Condition contravenes these statutory and regulatory provisions \nseveral times over, stating that the costs associated with providing legal services “to any removable \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 43 of 54 PageID #: 43\n \nalien (see 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(2)) or any alien otherwise unlawfully present in the United States \nare disallowed” under the VAWA and Victim Assistance programs. While the Condition contains \nan exception for legal services for which “disallowance would contravene any express requirement \nof any law,” it does not acknowledge the conflicting VOCA and VAWA provisions, or explain how \nthe Condition and provisions could fit together. \n135.  The Legal Services Condition is contrary to law with respect to the VAWA and \nVOCA Victim Assistance programs, and their clear directives that direct services under the \nprogram, including legal services, not be withheld from individuals based on immigration status. \nIV.  Harm to Plaintiff States \n136.  The imposition of the Legal Services Condition presents Plaintiff States with two \nequally untenable choices. First, the States could attempt to adhere to the Legal Services Condition, \nwhich could require them to transform their States’ VOCA, VAWA, and Byrne JAG operations \n(and, potentially, those of other federal grant programs administered by the DOJ and subject to the \nDOJ  Guide),  restrict  access  to  certain  services  for  certain  individuals,  demand  that  their \nsubgrantees somehow do the same, and endeavor to monitor subgrantees’ compliance. \n137.  Not only would this course run directly afoul of VOCA Victim Assistance and \nVAWA regulations, but it would immediately create immense compliance and monitoring costs for \nPlaintiff States. It would also undermine the trust that Plaintiffs States’ victim advocacy and law \nenforcement agencies, using the very resources provided by these grant programs, have worked \nhard to build with victims and witnesses across the States over the past four decades.  \n138.  The other option available to Plaintiff States is to forgo the unspent monies that the \nStates  have  already  been  awarded  by  the  formula  grants  rather  than  risk  contravening  the \nCondition. For some Plaintiff States, this could mean materially scaling back services available to \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 44 of 54 PageID #: 44\n \nvictims and other individuals across the states, likely having immediate impact in rural areas that \nare already resource-limited.  \n139.  To be clear, either of these choices would significantly undermine Plaintiff States’ \nVOCA and VAWA programs and victim services generally. Likewise, either path leads to a possible \nretreat to the status quo before these watershed statutes were adopted. \n140.  In the Byrne JAG context, impacted Plaintiff States would be required to choose \nbetween complying with the Legal Services Restriction, imposing additional limitations and strain \non already under-resourced court programs, or forgoing their unspent funds, which will result in \nstaffing shortages and cuts to services that were reliant on the availability of federal funds. Either \noption undermines the purpose of Byrne JAG to afford States flexibility to craft programs that \nimprove the criminal justice system.   \n141.  Plaintiff States face proprietary injuries stemming from the substantial new costs \nand operational burdens to comply with the Legal Services Condition, particularly if Plaintiff \nStates are required to affirmatively determine whether recipients of funded services are removable \nor unlawfully in the United States or are required to monitor compliance by subgrantees \n142.  The Legal Services Condition will also undermine the mission and efficacy of \nPlaintiff States’ own crime victim programs, causing negative impacts on public safety in Plaintiff \nStates.  \n143.  Plaintiffs  face  further  proprietary  injuries  because  they  face  the  threat  of \nenforcement,  jeopardizing  federal  funding  that  Plaintiff  States  receive.  The  Legal  Services \nCondition will go into effect October 31, and the threat of losing funding if States do not change \ntheir practices is an irreparable injury. See Cal. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-10810, 2025 WL 1667949, at \n*17 (D. Mass. June 13, 2025). The harms that the Legal Services Condition could impose on the \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 45 of 54 PageID #: 45\n \nPlaintiff  States  cannot  be  remedied  by  payments  at  the  conclusion  of  a  lengthy  litigation. \nAccordingly, declaratory, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief is needed from the Court. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nViolation of U.S. Constitution \nSpending Clause \n \n144.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n145.  The government can impose conditions on federal funds, but this power does “not \ninclude surprising participating States with post acceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp’l, 451 U.S. at 25.  \n146.  When  imposing  conditions  on  funding,  the  government  must  also  do  so \n“unambiguously,” id. at 17, and in a manner that enables State grantees to “knowingly decide \nwhether or not to accept those funds.” Id. at 24. \n147.  Defendants have violated both of these limits here. Defendants purport to impose \nan ambiguous and unclear condition on open grants that were awarded years ago, surprising \nPlaintiff States with a new condition that is entirely distinct from any conditions previously \n“knowingly” accepted. The Spending Clause prohibits this. \n148.  The Legal Services Condition that Defendants purport to impose is also improperly \nambiguous. The Condition is unclear as to what constitutes “legal services” and which groups of \nvictims and other individuals are to be excluded from those services, including how state agencies \n(and subgrantees) are to identify which victims and individuals to exclude.  \n149.  The Legal Services Condition will cause significant, imminent, and irreparable \nharm to Plaintiff States and to their programs that support crime victims and witnesses, and their \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 46 of 54 PageID #: 46\n \nfamilies, as well as, for example, public defender’s offices that play an essential role in ensuring \nthe efficiency of the criminal justice system. \n150.  Because it violates the Spending Clause’s prohibition on retroactive conditions, the \nLegal Services Condition as to open awards should be declared unconstitutional and preliminarily \nand permanently enjoined. \n151.  Because  the  Legal  Services  Condition  generally  (both  retrospectively  and \nprospectively) is also ambiguous in violation of the Spending Clause, the Condition should be \ndeclared unconstitutional in full and preliminarily and permanently enjoined. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n \n152.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n153.  The Legal Services Condition became immediately effective and is a “final agency \naction” for the purposes of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n154.  Under the APA, a court must set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 51 (agency action must be supported by a “rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made”); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (agency must provide “reasoned explanation” for departing from prior \npolicy and must provide “a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy” \nwhen “its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account”).  \n155.  A court must also set aside agency action if the agency “failed to consider . . . \nimportant aspects of the problem before” it. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. at 25 (citation \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 47 of 54 PageID #: 47\n \nomitted);  see  also  id.  at  30. An  agency  must  “pay[]  attention  to  the  advantages  and  the \ndisadvantages” of its decision. Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 753 (2015) (emphasis in original). \n156.  In imposing the Legal Services Condition, Defendants (i) failed to provide any \nreasoning at all, (ii) displayed no awareness of the change from longstanding position that the \nCondition represents, and did not demonstrate a reason for this change, (iii) appear to have imposed \na blanket, across-the-board condition on all DOJ grants with no consideration to the distinct \nstatutory schemes and goals underlying each, (iv) failed to consider multiple important aspects of \nthe problem, (v) failed to take into account the considerable reliance interests of Plaintiff States, \n(vi) have provided no guidance regarding how Plaintiff States are to interpret the many ambiguities \ninherent in the language of the Condition itself, and (vii) have provided no reasoning for their \nimposition of a post-acceptance condition. For each of these reasons, the Legal Services Condition \nis arbitrary and capricious.  \n157.  By incorporating the Condition in the DOJ Guide, Defendants indicate an intent to \napply the Condition to all DOJ grants, without regard for whether there is any underlying statutory \nauthority for such action. Defendants also failed to consider the consequences of the imposition of \nthe Condition on Plaintiff States, the unworkability of an immigration verification requirement in \nthe context of the kinds of legal services that have been funded through these grant programs, and \nthe reliance that Plaintiff States have in the systems they have already developed to comply with \nlongstanding conditions of these programs.  \n158.  Finally, Defendants have failed to provide any guidance or explanation as to how \nPlaintiff States are to interpret (and monitor) the many ambiguous aspects of the Condition, and \nhave attempted to apply the Condition retroactively to grants awarded years ago. For all these \nreasons, the Condition is arbitrary and capricious. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 48 of 54 PageID #: 48\n \n159.  The Legal Services Condition will cause significant, imminent, and irreparable \nharm to Plaintiff States and to their programs that support crime victims, witnesses, and their \nfamilies, as well as public defender’s offices that play an essential role in ensuring the efficiency \nof the criminal justice system. \n160.  For these reasons, the Legal Services Condition violates the APA and should be \ndeclared illegal, set aside, vacated, and preliminarily and permanently enjoined.   \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n  \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Contrary to Law (VAWA and VOCA Victim Assistance)  \n  \n161.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n162.  The Legal Services Condition became immediately effective and is a “final agency \naction” for the purposes of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n163.  The APA requires that a court set aside agency action that is “not in accordance with \nlaw.” Id. § 706(2)(A). \n164.  The VAWA statute and regulations disallow immigration status as an eligibility \nfactor for accessing VAWA services. See 34 U.S.C. § 12291(a)(24); 34 U.S.C. § 10441(b)(5); 28 \nC.F.R. § 90.4(c). VOCA Victim Assistance regulations state the same. 28 C.F.R. §§ 94.103(a), § \n94.116 (providing that “[v]ictim eligibility under this program for direct services is not dependent \non the victim’s immigration status.”).  \n165.  Under the APA, courts are “to set aside federal agency action that is ‘not in \naccordance with law.’” FCC v. NextWave Pers. Commc’ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) (quoting \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). An agency is “bound by its own regulations so long as they remain in \nforce.” Wallace v. Christensen, 802 F.2d 1539, 1552 n.8 (9th Cir. 1986) (citing United States ex \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 49 of 54 PageID #: 49\n \nrel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 267 (1954)). Furthermore, an agency must comply with \nits “own regulations and policies.” Doe v. Noem, 778 F. Supp. 3d 1151, 1160 (W.D. Wash. 2025). \nThe Condition directly contradicts VOCA regulations stating the immigration status is not an \neligibility factor for services; as an action contrary to Defendants’ own regulations, the Legal \nServices Condition must be set aside as contrary to law. \n166.  The Legal Services Condition will cause significant, imminent, and irreparable \nharm to Plaintiff States and to their programs that support crime victims and witnesses, and their \nfamilies. \n167.  For these reasons, the Condition violates the APA and should be declared illegal, \nset aside, vacated, and preliminarily and permanently enjoined.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs pray that the Court: \na.  Declare that Defendants’ imposition of any aspect of the Legal Services Condition is \ncontrary to the Spending Clause and the Constitution; \nb.  Declare that Defendants’ imposition of any aspect of the Legal Services Condition is \narbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; \nc.  Declare that Defendants’ imposition of any aspect of the Legal Services Condition as \nto the VAWA and VOCA Victim Assistance programs is contrary to law in violation of \nthe APA; \nd.  Stay the policy of imposing the Legal Services Condition on any grants for which it \nhas been imposed, and stay the inclusion of the Legal Services Condition in the DOJ \nGuide (including as incorporated in any future version of the DOJ Guide), pursuant to \n5 U.S.C. § 705; \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00499     Document 1     Filed 10/01/25     Page 50 of 54 PageID #: 50\n \ne.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from implementing or enforcing any \naspect of the Legal Services Condition, including its inclusion in the DOJ Guide, in or \nagainst the Plaintiff States; \nf.  Retain jurisdiction to monitor Defendants’ compliance with this Court’s judgment; \ng.  Award Plaintiff States their reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ \nfees; and, \nh.  Award such additional relief as this Court may deem just and proper. \n \nDated: October 1, 2025           Respectfully submitted,  \nLETITIA JAMES  PHILIP J.
