OCR claimed the NYCPS Guidelines to Support Transgender and Gender-Expansive Students violated Title IX by allowing students to use facilities and join activities consistent with their gender identity. Plaintiffs filed this case in the Southern District of New York to challenge these determinations, seeking to acate the Department&rsquo;s discontinuation orders, enjoin enforcement of the new Title IX interpretation or related Executive Orders against NYCPS, and restore its MSAP grants and allow orderly use of carryover funds.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Civil Action No.  \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nEDUCATION, LINDA MCMAHON, in \nher capacity as Secretary of the United \nStates Department of Education, CRAIG \nW. TRAINOR, in his capacity as Acting \nAssistant Secretary for Civil Rights, \nLINDSEY M. BURKE, in her capacity as \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Policy and \nPrograms \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \nPlaintiff, the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York, \noperating as New York City Public Schools (“NYCPS”), by its attorney, Muriel Goode-Trufant, \nCorporation Counsel of the City of New York, for its verified complaint against the United States \nDepartment of Education (the “Department”); Linda McMahon, in her capacity as Secretary of the \nUnited States Department of Education; Craig W. Trainor, in his capacity as Acting Assistant \nSecretary for Civil Rights; and Lindsey M. Burke, in her capacity as Deputy Chief of Staff for \nPolicy and Programs, alleges upon personal knowledge as to itself and upon information and belief \nas to all other matters: \nI.  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n1.  NYCPS school students attending nineteen magnet schools in Brooklyn, the \nBronx, Manhattan and Queens, should be enjoying the excitement and anticipation that only a \n  1 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 2 of 48\nnew school year brings. Instead, on September 16, 2025, the United States Department of \nEducation turned their lives upside down. On that day, two weeks after the 2025-2026 school \nyear had already begun, the Department, through its Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) summarily, \nwithout prior notice or hearing, and contrary to law, notified NYCPS of the Department’s \ndecision to discontinue five-year Magnet Schools Assistance Program (“MSAP”) grants awarded \nin 2022 and 2023 to five groups, or “consortiums,” of NYCPS magnet schools (the “NYCPS \nMSAP Projects” or the “Projects”) to support the operation of the nineteen NYCPS MSAP-\nfunded schools (the “Schools”), because of alleged violations of Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (“Title IX”). \n2.   Over the next days, the Department took a series of additional actions to \neffectuate the discontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP grants, throwing into chaos and uncertainty the \nSchools’ futures—along with the plans of the approximately 7700 NYCPS students who attend \nthem. The Department’s unprecedented actions—undertaken without notice, investigation, \nhearing, or opportunity to respond, and without a valid substantive basis—represent a blatant \nattempt to avoid the exacting process required by law before the lives of schoolchildren, parents, \nteachers, and administrators can be completely upended by the withdrawal of financial support to \ntheir schools. The Department’s conduct was also a misuse of MSAP’s intended grant \ncontinuation certification and performance review processes, which should be carried out in \nservice of Congress’ clear wish that the funding of magnet schools who are making progress \ntowards the goals set by Congress continue.  \n3.  The immediate effect of the Department’s actions is the complete disruption of \nthe Schools’ ability to carry out their specialized programming during the school year, due to the \nloss of approximately $11 million in carryover MSAP funding previously awarded to the five \nProjects for the previous fiscal year, FY 2025, but now rendered unavailable in FY 2026 by the \n  2 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 3 of 48\nsudden discontinuation of the grant, effective October 1, 2025. It also means the abrupt end to \ngrant funding for the remaining period of the five-year grants. An additional $36 million in \nfederal support had been promised to the Schools under the five-year grant terms, for the period \nfrom now through 2028 (the remainder of their 5-year grants). The discontinued MSAP grants \nprovided critical funding necessary for the nineteen magnet Schools to provide curricula in topics \nlike cutting-edge science, technology, engineering, architecture, and math (“STEAM”); \nmultimedia and the arts; performing arts; engineering; journalism; civic activism; and leadership \nto schools which have historically served isolated, and overwhelmingly low income, Hispanic \nand Black students. \n4.  The discontinuation was purportedly based on a “finding” by OCR—made \nwithout notice, investigation or inquiry—that NYCPS’ Guidelines to Support Transgender and \nGender Expansive Students (the “NYCPS Guidelines”) violate Title IX by allowing NYCPS \ntransgender students to use bathroom, changing room and locker room facilities; participate in \nathletic activities; and be provided with overnight accommodations on school trips, consistent \nwith their gender identity.  \n5.  However, the NYCPS Guidelines have been in place since 2019—with prior \nversions dating back to 2014—and NYCPS MSAP Projects have previously been judged by \nOCR officials in multiple MSAP grant cycles to be operating entirely consistent with Title IX. \nThe abrupt about-face by the Department, seemingly based on the Trump Administration’s \nfixation with upending the Department’s previously accepted interpretation of Title IX puts \npolitics before public schools. It is also contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and based on a \nnew interpretation of federal law imposed without engaging in notice-and-comment rulemaking.  \n6.  Moreover, the Department actions are a clear attempted end run around the \nCongressional directive that school funding not be pulled on a whim: the Department’s purported \n  3 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 4 of 48\ndiscontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP grants is being carried out unlawfully, without observance of \nprocedures required both by Title IX itself, and by the federal regulations governing the \noperation of MSAP grants. First, the Department failed to follow Title IX’s robust procedural \nrequirements before making a finding that the NYCPS Guidelines violate Title IX and purporting \nto take action based on that finding to discontinue all MSAP funding to the Schools; those \nprocedures include an opportunity for a hearing, express findings on the record, and filing a \nreport with each Congressional committee with jurisdiction as to the circumstances and grounds \nfor the discontinuance.  \n7.  Second, where—as here—a decision is made to discontinue a multi-year MSAP \ngrant, the grantee is entitled to notice, and the opportunity to request reconsideration of the \ndecision. 34 CFR § 75.253(g).1 Here, NYCPS was offered “reconsideration” in name only. The \nDepartment conditioned the offer on NYCPS’ agreement that it would take all of the remedial \nsteps that OCR demanded—and do so within three business days. The remedial steps would \nrequire NYCPS to dismantle the NYCPS Guidelines and implement the very determination about \nwhich it would seek reconsideration. A failure to agree to the remedial measures would \nautomatically result in a denial of reconsideration.   \n8.  NYCPS brings this action to restore the Schools to the status they held on \nSeptember 15, 2025 through an order that the Department’s discontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP \ngrants be vacated and set aside as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and as having been undertaken without observance of procedures required by law. It \nalso seeks to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Department from implementing, \nmaintaining, or reinstating the discontinuation, or otherwise taking any other action to suspend, \n \n1 To the extent the discontinuation could be considered a termination, NYCPS was entitled to an opportunity to object to and \nprovide information and documentation challenging the termination action. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340–41 \n  4 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 5 of 48\nterminate, or refuse to continue the NYCPS’ MSAP Projects; and any other appropriate relief \nrequired to effectuate the continuation of the NYCPS’ MSAP Projects.   \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 1346. Jurisdiction is \nalso proper under the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ \n702, 704. The Court is authorized to issue the relief sought here under the Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, \n2202. \n10.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1) because \nDefendants are an agency of the United States Government and officers sued in their official \ncapacities. Plaintiff is a resident of this judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claim occurred and are continuing to occur in this district. \nIII.  PARTIES \n \n11.  Plaintiff the Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New \nYork, operating as New York City Public Schools, is the entity responsible for the governance, \nmanagement, and oversight of New York City’s public school district (the “City District”). The \nCity District is a city school district created under the laws of the State of New York which \noperates more than 1600 schools in New York City. The City District encompasses 32 \ngeography-based community school districts, as well as several specialized districts. Each \ncommunity school district has a superintendent, and 11 additional superintendents lead groups of \nhigh schools. Almost one million students are enrolled in NYCPS, making it the largest school \ndistrict in the United States. \n12.  Defendant United States Department of Education is the agency of the federal \ngovernment that establishes policy for, administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to \n  5 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 6 of 48\neducation. Among other responsibilities, the Department administers MSAP through its Office of \nElementary and Secondary Education (“OESE”) and enforces Title IX through the Office for \nCivil Rights. \n13.  Linda McMahon is the Secretary of the Department of Education. Secretary \nMcMahon is named as a defendant in her official capacity. \n14.  Craig W. Trainor is the Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the United \nStates Department of Education. He is the head of the Department’s Office for Civil Rights, \nwhich is the office charged with enforcement of Federal civil rights laws that prohibit \ndiscrimination in Department programs, or activities that receive Federal funds from the \nDepartment, including Title IX. Assistant Secretary Trainor is named as a defendant in his \nofficial capacity. \n15.  Lindsey M. Burke is the Deputy Chief for Policy and Programs in the United \nStates Department of Education. Upon information and belief, she is the Deciding Official for \nReconsideration Requests in the United States Department of Education. Deputy Chief Burke is \nnamed as a defendant in her official capacity. \nIV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nA.  New York City Public Schools  \n \n16.  NYCPS is an ethnically diverse school district. As of 2023-2024, student \nenrollment was 42.2% Hispanic, 19.5% Black, 18.7% Asian, 16.2% White, 1.8% multi-racial, \nand 1.2% Native American/Alaskan. Among our students, more than 180 languages are spoken. \nAdditionally, in the 2023-2024 school year, 73.5% of NYCPS students were considered \n  6 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 7 of 48\n“economically disadvantaged,” meaning—by reference to the federal poverty line—that they live \nin poverty, or are served by schools with high concentrations of students living in poverty.2 \nB.  NYCPS Magnet Schools \n \n17.  Supported by federal law and policy, magnet schools developed in the 1970s as a \nvoluntary desegregation tool and an alternative to mandatory busing as a remedy for segregated \nschools. They are defined under federal law as public elementary or secondary schools that offer \n“a special curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial \nbackgrounds.” 20 U.S.C. 7231a. “Magnet” refers to the fact that students attending the school \ncome from across normal attendance boundaries.  \n18.  As contemplated by this federal law and policy, many NYCPS students live in \nmono-ethnic and -socio-economic neighborhoods and attend NYCPS schools with similar \ndemographics. NYCPS’s development and expansion of magnet schools is a powerful tool in \ncombatting this racial and socio-economic segregation in the City District. \n19.  NYCPS currently operates over 200 magnet schools, many of which were initially \nestablished using federal seed funding provided by the Department through the federal Magnet \nSchool Assistance Program, with the expectation that once federal funding expired, the schools \nwould continue to operate as self-sustaining magnet schools offering thematic programming. \nC.  Magnet School Assistance Program (MSAP) Grants \n \n1.  The Purpose and Requirements of MSAP Grants \n \n20.  MSAP is a federal grant program authorized by statute and administered by the \nDepartment through the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 7231-\n7231j.  MSAP provides grants to eligible local educational agencies (“LEAs”) and groups, or \n \n2 New York City Public Schools, NYCPS Data At A Glance (2025), publicly available at https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-\nus/reports/nycps-data-at-a-glance \n  7 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 8 of 48\n“consortia” of LEAs to establish and operate magnet schools under mandatory desegregation \nplans or voluntary efforts designed to bring students from different social, ethnic, and racial \nbackgrounds together. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 7231-7231j. In establishing MSAP, Congress made \nfindings as to the  significance and multiple educational and societal benefits of magnet schools, \nand expressly recognized them as being in the best interests of the United States:  \n. . .  \n(4) It is in the best interests of the United States— \n  (A) to continue the Federal Government's support of local educational agencies \nthat are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans and local educational agencies \nthat are voluntarily seeking to foster meaningful interaction among students of different \nracial and ethnic backgrounds, beginning at the earliest stage of such students' education; \n  (B) to ensure that all students have equitable access to a high quality education \nthat will prepare all students to function well in a technologically oriented and a highly \ncompetitive economy comprised of people from many different racial and ethnic \nbackgrounds; and \n  (C) to continue to desegregate and diversify schools by supporting magnet \nschools, recognizing that segregation exists between minority and nonminority students \nas well as among students of different minority groups. \n(5) Desegregation efforts through magnet school programs are a significant part of our \nNation's effort to achieve voluntary desegregation in schools and help to ensure equal \neducational opportunities for all students. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 7231(a). \n \n21.  MSAP grants financially support, inter alia, (1) the elimination, reduction, and \nprevention of minority group isolation in elementary and secondary schools with substantial \nnumbers of minority group students; (2) the development, implementation, and expansion of \nmagnet school programs designed to meet challenging state standards; (3) the development, \ndesign, and expansion of innovative educational methods and practices that promote diversity \nand choice in public school education; (4) courses of instruction that will substantially strengthen \nstudents’ attainment of tangible and marketable career, technological and professional skills; (5) \nthe capacity of LEAs to continue operating magnet schools at high level after the conclusion of \nthe period of federal funding; and (6) equitable access to high quality education that will enable \n  8 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 9 of 48\nstudents to continue with postsecondary education or employment. 20 U.S.C. § 7231(b); 34 \nC.F.R. § 280.1. \n22.  In its current iteration, MSAP provides for annual awards of up to $3.5 million \nper LEA or consortium of LEAs, for a project period of up to 5 years. Initially, MSAP grants \nwere provided for 2-year periods, a limit that was later extended to 3 years, before 2015, when \nthe 5-year period was adopted as part of Congress’ passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act,3 \nproviding a longer incubation period for the creation of sustainable magnet programs.  \n23.  Among other requirements, MSAP projects must “be operated in a manner \nconsistent with discrimination requirements contained in Federal civil rights laws.” 87 Fed. Reg. \n9591 (Feb. 22, 2022). Thus, as part of the application process for an MSAP grant, an eligible LEA \nor consortium of LEAs must provide the Department assurances that it will not engage in \ndiscrimination based on race, religion, color, national origin, sex, or disability in, inter alia, \nassigning students to schools or course of instruction or designing or operating extracurricular \nactivities for students. 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(b)(2)(C)(ii), (iii). And the authorizing statute for \nMSAP provides that “[n]o grant shall be awarded under this part unless the Assistant Secretary \nof Education for Civil Rights determines that the assurances described in subsection (b)(2)(C) \nwill be met.” 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(c). \n24.  The Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights (“Assistant Secretary”) is \nthe head of the Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which is the office charged with \nenforcement of Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in Department programs, or \nactivities that receive Federal funds from the Department, including Title IX. See 20 U.S.C. § \n1681; 34 C.F.R. § 106 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. § 100.7. \n   \n \n3 The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), Public Law 114-95 (December 10, 2015) amended 20 U.S.C. § 7231h to extend \nthe maximum length of MSAP grants to 5 years from 3. \n  9 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 10 of 48\n2.  The Operation of Multi-Year MSAP Grants \n \n25.  The General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1221 et seq. (“GEPA”) and \nthe Department’s own financial assistance regulatory framework govern the Department’s \nadministration of multi-year MSAP funds. The Department’s financial assistance regulations, \n34 C.F.R. § 75 et seq., address (1) the Department’s competitive grantmaking selection process \nfor new grants; and (2) its determination whether to continue a grantee’s multi-year project–a \nprocess that does not involve competition with other grantees.  Id. §§ 75.215-227; 75.253. In \naddition, the MSAP regulations provide that grants are governed by Title 2 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations. Id. § 280.3. GEPA requires that rules affecting the Department’s \nprovision of financial assistance go through the APA’s notice and comment process. See 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1221e-4, 1232; 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n26.  When the Department announces a competition for new grants, it publishes an \napplication notice (“Notice Inviting Applications”) in the Federal Register that explains, among \nother things, the relevant selection criteria, and whether the Secretary plans to approve multi-\nyear projects and, if so, the project period that will be approved. The Department scores the \nquality of each application using the selection criteria and competitive priorities, ranks the \napplications, and selects applications for new grants in rank order. 34 C.F.R. § 75.217; U.S. \nDepartment of Education, Discretionary Grantmaking at ED (Oct. 2024) (“Discretionary \nGrantmaking”)4 at 26-27.  \n27.  The procedures governing the Department’s decision whether to continue multi-\nyear grants are quite different. See Discretionary Grantmaking at 31–32. When awarding multi-\nyear projects, the Department funds the initial budget period (usually 12-months) and “indicates \n \n4 Publicly available at https://www.ed.gov/media/document/grantmaking-ed-108713.pdf. \n  10 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 11 of 48\n[its] intention to make continuation awards to fund the remainder of the project period.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 75.251(a)-(b).   \n28.  At the end of the annual budget period, when the time comes for a multi-year \ngrant to be continued, the Department reviews information relevant to the grantee’s \nperformance for the prior year, including performance reports, performance measures, and \nfinancial data. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 75.118, 75.253(b); Discretionary Grantmaking at 32 (“The \nprogram staff uses the information in the performance report in combination with the project’s \nfiscal and management performance data to determine subsequent funding decisions.”); 59 Fed. \nReg. 30259 (June 10, 1994). \n29.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a) provides that in order to receive a continuation award after \nthe first budget period of a multi-year grant, the grantee must, inter alia, demonstrate substantial \nprogress in achieving the goals and objectives of the project, submit all required performance \nreports, continue to meet all eligibility requirements of the program, and “receive a \ndetermination from the Secretary that continuation of the project is in the best interests of the \nFederal Government.” In making a continuation award, the Secretary “also considers whether the \ngrantee is operating in compliance with the assurances in its approved application, including \nthose applicable to Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities \nreceiving Federal financial assistance from the Department.” See 87 Fed. Reg. 9595 (Feb. 22, \n2022); 88 Fed. Reg. 15705 (March 14, 2023).  \n30.  The Department has long represented that a cut-off in continuation award funding \nis “extremely rare in practice.” 59 Fed. Reg. 30259 (June 10, 1994). More recently, the \nDepartment explained that “In general, we do not deny a large number of non-competing \ncontinuation awards and, if that does happen, grantees are often aware of the likelihood of the \n  11 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 12 of 48\ndecision well in advance and often cite no concerns if they do not receive a continuation award.” \n89 Fed. Reg. 70,316 (Aug. 29, 2024).  \n31.  Where the Department decides not to continue a multi-year grant, the Secretary \nmust notify the grantee of that decision, the grounds on which it is based and, “consistent with 2 \nCFR 200.342,5 provide the grantee with an opportunity to request reconsideration of the \ndecision.” 34 CFR § 75.253(g).6  \n32.  Finally, where a grant is not continued, the Secretary may authorize a no-cost \nextension of the last budget period in order “to provide for an orderly closeout of the grant.” 34 \nCFR § 75.253(h). A no-cost extension is an extension of the period of performance for a grant \nthat would not require the obligation of additional Federal funds but would permit a grantee to \nspend available unobligated funds remaining beyond the original grant performance period. See \n2 CFR § 200.308(f)(10). \nD.  NYCPS’s MSAP Grants \n \n33.  NYCPS has been a recipient of MSAP grants for its magnet schools since at least \n2010. Between 2010 and 2022, 63 different NYCPS magnet schools have been funded under \nMSAP. During the continuation years of each of the MSAP grants awarded to NYCPS during \nthose periods, NYCPS’ magnet school projects were found to be in the “best interests of the \nFederal Government” pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a), and NYCPS MSAP projects’ \n \n5 2 CFR § 200.342 provides that “[u]pon initiating a remedy for noncompliance (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective \naction plan, or termination), the Federal agency must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide \ninformation challenging the action.” \n6 To the extent the Department effectuates a termination of an MSAP grant, the requirements of 2 C.F.R. Part 200 governing \nthe whole or partial termination of a federal award for non-compliance would apply, requiring the Department to make a \ndetermination that any alleged non-compliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, as required by 2 \nC.F.R. § 280.339, and requiring notice and an opportunity to object to and provide information and documentation \nchallenging the termination action. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340–42. \n \n  12 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 13 of 48\nassurances of compliance with federal civil rights were routinely certified pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \n§ 7231d(c), without exception.7   \n34.  On February 22, 2022, the Department published in the Federal Register a Notice \nInviting Applications (“NIA”) for FY 2022 (“FY22”) from LEAs or consortia of LEA’s for \nMSAP grants of up to $3.5 million per budget year, for a project period of up to 5 years, to create \nor revise magnet schools. 87 Fed. Reg. 9587 (Feb. 22, 2022). NYCPS applied for MSAP grants \nin response to the FY22 NIA through three new inter-district magnet school projects, each \ninvolving two community school districts (“CSD”): (1) Brooklyn Inter-District (CSD 32 and 16); \n(2) Brooklyn and Queens Inter-District (CSD 19 and 27); and (3) Queens Inter-District (CSD 28 \nand 29) (together, the “FY22 MSAP Projects”).  \n35.  The FY22 MSAP Projects involved transforming 13 schools—8 primary schools, \nand 5 middle or intermediate schools—located in Brooklyn and Queens into new magnet schools \nserving students from pre-kindergarten and/or kindergarten through 5th grade (for primary \nschools), and sixth through eighth grades (for middle or intermediate schools). The FY22 MSAP \nProjects have launched schools with diverse programmatic focuses including journalism and \nmultimedia;8 innovative leadership and civic activism;9 multimedia arts and engineering;10 \ndiscovery and applied learning;11 leadership and exploration;12 multimedia and the performing \narts;13 and leadership through engineering.14 \n \n7 Notably, as discussed herein, during part or all of every single one of those past MSAP project periods except the very first \none (2010-2013), NYCPS had in place a version of what is currently known as its Guidelines to Support Transgender and \nGender Expansive Students. \n8 PS 202, The Magnet School of Journalism and Multimedia \n9 PS 312, The Jamaica Children’s Magnet School for Innovative Leadership and Civic Activism \n10 VSCMS, The Magnet School of Multimedia Arts and Engineering \n11 PS 182, The Samantha Smith Magnet School for Discovery and Applied Learning \n12 MS 332, The Redwood Magnet School for Leadership and Exploration \n13 MS 72, The Catherine and Count Basie Magnet School of Multimedia and the Arts \n14 PS 145, The Magnet School of Leadership Through Engineering \n  13 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 14 of 48\n36.  On March 14, 2023, the Department published in the Federal Register an NIA for \nFY 2023 (“FY23”) inviting applications from LEAs or consortia of LEAs for MSAP grants of up \nto $3.5 million per budget year, for a project period of up to 5 years to create or revise magnet \nschools. 88 Fed. Reg. 15697 (March 14, 2023). NYCPS applied for MSAP grants in response to \nthe FY23 NIA through two new inter-district magnet school projects, each involving three CSDs: \n(1) Bronx Inter-District (CSD 7, 10, and 11); and (2) Manhattan Inter-District (CSD 4, 2, and 6) \n(together, the “FY23 MSAP Projects”). \n37.  The two FY23 MSAP Projects involved transforming six high schools located in \nManhattan and the Bronx into new magnet schools serving students in grades 6-12 with \nprogrammatic focuses on, among other things, STEAM;15 early college exploration;16 career \nconnected learning;17 aspiring educators;18 and innovation through visual arts19.  \n38.  As part of the MSAP grant applications in both FY22 and FY23, each CSD \nmember of the MSAP Projects provided the Department with a signed assurance of compliance \nwith federal civil rights law, a prerequisite for NYCPS’ eligibility to receive this MSAP grant \nfunding. \n39.  By the issuance of three Grant Award Notifications in FY22, and two Grant \nAward Notifications in FY23, the Department awarded MSAP grants of $2,999,999 per year to \neach of the MSAP Projects on or about September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2023, \nrespectively, for a total award of almost $15 million per Project over each grant’s 5-year project \nperformance period. For the FY22 MSAP Projects, the performance period was from October 1, \n \n15 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis STEAM Magnet School of Business Careers  \n16 Esperanza Early College Exploration and Leadership Magnet \n17 Magnet School of Career Connected Learning \n18 Magnet School for Aspiring 21st Century Educators and Leaders \n19 Magnet High School for Innovation through Visual Arts \n  14 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 15 of 48\n2022 through September 30, 2027. For the FY23 MSAP Projects, the performance period was \nfrom October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2028. \n40.  In each case, in awarding MSAP grants, the Department determined that the \ngrants were in the best interests of the Federal Government, and—through OCR—certified the \nassurances by the NYCPS MSAP applicants that they comply with federal civil rights law. At the \ntime that the Department made those determinations and certifications, the NYCPS Guidelines to \nsupport transgender and gender expansive students in NYCPS were in place. \n41.  Since the time that the FY22 and FY23 MSAP Projects began on October 1, 2022 \nand October 1, 2023, respectively, without exception, they each received MSAP funding for an \ninitial budget period, and for continuation budget periods. In connection with each continuation \nof the MSAP grants, the MSAP Projects submitted the Spring annual performance reports \nrequired by 34 C.F.R. § 75.118 to the Department, and the Department determined that the grants \nwere in the best interests of the Federal Government, and—through OCR—certified the \nassurances by the applicants that they comply with federal civil rights law. At the time that the \nDepartment made those determinations and certifications, the NYCPS Guidelines to support \ntransgender and gender expansive students in NYCPS were in place.  \n42.  Since their initial budget periods in October of 2022 and 2023, respectively, the \nNYCPS MSAP Projects have made use of the MSAP grant funds to successfully design, develop, \nand launch the initial phases of innovative magnet school programs at the 19 funded magnet \nschools, with the expectation that they would be given the full 5 years of funding that Congress \nintended, in order to position their schools to successfully transition into self-sustaining magnet \nschools. Using MSAP funding, FY22 MSAP Project Schools have established a student-led \nbroadcasting station,20 created specialty learning spaces including a podcasting lab and a \n \n20  PS 86, Bushwick Magnet Multimedia and Arts Academy \n  15 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 16 of 48\nSTEAM lab,21 hired full-time engineering/STEM instructors,22 developed an active student \nnewspaper and morning news station,23 begun to establish a state-of-the-art fabrication lab and \nrecording studio,24 and created a puppet-making residency.25  \n43.  Using MSAP funding, FY23 MSAP Project Schools have begun implementing \nearly college courses with a local college,26 established Advanced Placement classes and a dual \nenrollment option with a local college,27 developed a financial technology lab with a financial \nliteracy curriculum,28 facilitated an entirely student-designed and produced full scale musical \nproduction,29 launched a student-led social media team providing students with hands-on \nexperience in graphic design, digital storytelling, and strategic communication,30 and developed \na design lab.31 \n44.  In only 3 years since the launch of the FY22 MAPS Project, NYCPS’ MSAP-\nfunded Schools have already been recognized with a Magnet Schools of America Top Magnet \nSchool of Excellence Award,32 seen students crowned District debate champions,33 and achieved \nremarkable improvements in English and math proficiency.34  \n45.  As Congress intended, NYCPS’ 5-year plans for the FY22 MSAP Project magnet \nSchools were focused on using the funding in remaining budget periods to ensure that the \n \n21 PS 116, Leadership Through Multimedia and the Arts Magnet School \n22 PS 145, The Magnet School of Leadership Through Engineering \n23 PS 202, The Magnet School of Journalism and Multimedia \n24 VSCMS, The Magnet School of Multimedia Arts and Engineering \n25 PS 135, The Bellaire Magnet School of Exploration Through the Arts \n26  Esperanza Early College Exploration and Leadership Magnet \n27 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis STEAM Magnet School for Business Careers \n28 Id. \n29 City College Magnet School of the Arts \n30 Magnet High School for Innovation Through Visual Arts \n31 Id. \n32 MS 35, The Magnet School of Leadership, Exploration, and the Arts \n33 PS 182, The Samantha Smith Magnet School for Discovery and Applied Learning \n34 The percentage of students achieving proficiency in Math and English at the Bushwick Magnet Multimedia and the Arts \nAcademy had improved by 24.7 and 20.6 percentage points, respectively. The Magnet School of Leadership and Innovation \nimproved its math proficiency by 24.9 percentage points, and The Magnet School of Multimedia Arts and Engineering \nimproved its by 29.7 percentage points.  \n  16 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 17 of 48\nmagnet Schools become self-sustaining after September 30, 2027 when the FY22 MSAP \nProjects’ funding period was scheduled to expire. For example, one of the Schools had planned \nto purchase a SmartTable Collaborative Learning Center in budget year 4, and an A+ STEM Law \nRobotic Technology Kit in year 5.35 Another had budgeted to purchase a Phase IV of a \nMultimedia Lab Production Package, having purchased Phases I, II, and III during its first 3 \nyears.36  \n46.   NYCPS’ 5-year plans for the FY23 MSAP magnet Schools, which are a year less \nestablished, were created to ensure that the Schools become self-sustaining by September 30, \n2028 when the FY23 MSAP Projects funding period was scheduled to expire. With only 2 \nfunded years completed, these Projects were only just getting underway and had planned to \ninvest considerable resources to develop partnerships, and design the experiences, core practices, \nsystems and structures necessary to ensure sustainability.  \n47.  Because of the timing of initial MSAP grant approvals, and initial funding, which \noperate on the federal fiscal schedule, not the school calendar, it is typical that projects receiving \nMSAP grant funding are not able to begin spending the grant funds received during the initial \nbudget year until well into the school year. This inevitably results in a portion of the first-year \ngrant amount not being expended during the designated “year 1” budget period. This likelihood \nis recognized in the federal program regulations, which provide that unspent amounts from one \nbudget year become “carryover” which must be spent in the following budget year before any of \nthe second year’s grant funding is spent. Carryover from one budget year to the next often recurs \n(and gradually increases in size) during the successive years of the MSAP grant. \n \n35 PS 116, Leadership Through Multimedia and the Arts Magnet School \n36 MS 35, The Magnet School of Leadership, Exploration, and the Arts \n  17 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 18 of 48\n48.  As set forth at 34 CFR 75.253(d), “a grantee may expend funds that have not been \nobligated at the end of a budget period for obligations of the subsequent budget period” and \nNYCPS MSAP projects have done so in prior years, “if the obligation is for an allowable cost \nthat falls within the scope and objectives of the project.” As long as a grant is continued from \none budget period to the next, any carryover funds from the prior budget period will be available \nto the grantee to be spent in the subsequent budget period. As of today, , the combined FY25 \nunspent funds that available for carryover for use by the five NYCPS MSAP Projects is \napproximately $11 million. See also, 34 CFR § 75.253(e). \n49.  In May of 2025, each of the MSAP Projects timely submitted an Spring annual \nperformance report to the Department, in which it documented its progress towards the Project \ngoals, provided a financial update, and submitted the required assurances of compliance with \nfederal civil rights law. Each also documented in the report the amount of unspent funds it was \nseeking to carryover into the next budget period, and submitted a budget documenting the ways \nin which the carryover funds would be used in the next budget period for allowable costs falling \nwithin the scope and objectives of the Project. \nE.  OCR’s Discontinuation of NYCPS’s MSAP Grants  \n \n50.  In or around September 2025, the Department’s decided to discontinue NYCPS’ \nMSAP grants effective September 30, 2025, and effectuated this decision by four separate \nactions: (1) OCR’s refusal to certify NYCPS’ compliance with federal civil rights law pursuant \nto 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(c), communicated in a letter dated September 16, 2025; (2) the non-\ncontinuation decision—communicated both initially, in the September 16, 2025 letter, and upon \nreconsideration, in a letter dated September 26, 2025—pursuant to 34 CFR 75.253(a)(5); (3) the \nresetting of the project performance period to September 30, 2025 made effective by the issuance \nof revised Grant Award Notifications on September 30, 2025; and (4) the election not to \n  18 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 19 of 48\nauthorize a no-cost extension to facilitate orderly closeout of the grants, which was \ncommunicated first in the September 26, 2025 letter, and affirmed in the subsequent Grant \nAward Notifications (together, the “Discontinuation”). \n1.  The September 16, 2025 Notice of Discontinuation \n \n51.  On September 16, 2025, Acting Assistant Secretary Craig W. Trainor sent a letter \nnotifying NYCPS that OCR “has identified a civil rights compliance issue” with NYCPS due to \nthe NYCPS Guidelines (the “OCR Discontinuation Letter”). This notice arrived more than two \nweeks into the 2025-2026 school year at the 19 covered magnet Schools, where approximately \n7700 students are attending school and countless other employees are working to foster and \nsupport the students’ education, including, for each MSAP Project, a Project Director who is led \nand supported by NYCPS’ Director of Magnet Schools Assistance Program, specialized teachers \ntrained to deliver innovative curriculum, and onsite coaches charged with building the Schools’ \ncapacity to continue operating as a magnet school.  \n52.  The OCR Discontinuation Letter announced a finding by OCR that the District-\nwide NYCPS Guidelines discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX in that (1) \nNYCPS permits students to use restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity; \n(2) students are permitted to participate in all school activities, including sports and overnight \nfield trips, in accordance with their gender identity, with privacy concerns to be addressed on a \ncase-by-case basis; and (3) transgender or gender expansive students may not be required to use \nan alternative facility, such as a single-occupancy restroom, or a facility that conflicts with their \ngender identity.    \n53.  On the basis of that purported finding, which was made without notice, \ninvestigation, hearing, or opportunity to contest, the Acting Assistant Secretary refused to certify \nfor the FY26 grant continuation period, stating that NYCPS cannot meet its civil rights \n  19 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 20 of 48\nassurances, as required by 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(c), and that NYCPS’s MSAP grant would be non-\ncontinued under 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) because “it is no longer in the best interest of the \nFederal Government.” (See OCR Discontinuation Letter).  \n54.  In announcing the non-continuation of NYCPS’ MSAP grant, the letter did not \npurport to make any findings, nor identify any concerns, about NYCPS’ performance reports, \nperformance measures, or financial data for the prior year. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 75.118, \n75.253(b); Discretionary Grantmaking at 32. \n55.  Likewise, the letter did not provide any performance-related explanation as to \nwhy the MSAP grants were “no longer in the best interest” of the Federal Government, whether \nby reference to the purpose of MSAP—including the Congressional findings that continuing to \nfund MSAP projects is in the best interests of the United States—or by offering any other \nexplanation. \n56.  Instead, OCR simply demanded that NYCPS agree to take “remedial measures,” \nand indicated that NYCPS could request reconsideration of the decision, but only if NYCPS \nnotified OCR in writing by 5 p.m. ET on Friday, September 19, 2025—within three business \ndays—that it would agree to take the following “remedial steps,” outlined in the letter, to ensure \nits compliance with Title IX: \n1.  Adopt biology-based definitions for the words ‘male’ and ‘female’ \npursuant to Title IX; \n2.  Issue a public statement to parents, students, and staff stating that \nNew York City Public Schools will comply with Title IX and \nspecifying that it will not allow males to compete in female athletic \nprograms or occupy intimate facilities designated for females; \n3.  Specify that New York City Public Schools must provide intimate \nfacilities such as locker rooms and bathrooms accessible to its \nstudents strictly separated on the basis of sex and comparably \nprovided to each sex;  \n4.  Specify that New York City Public Schools must provide sleeping \narrangements during overnight activities and athletic trips to its \n  20 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 21 of 48\nstudents strictly separated on the basis of sex and comparably \nprovided to each sex; \n5.  Specify that Title IX forbids schools from allowing boys or men to \nparticipate in any athletic program designated for girls or women, \nensuring that only female students are eligible to join, participate, or \nbe categorized or counted as a member of Girls’ \nTeam(s)/Category(s) and that all male students are ineligible to join, \nparticipate, or be categorized or counted as a member of Girls’ \nTeam(s)/Category(s); and  \n6.  Rescind any guidance that violates Title IX, remove or revise any \ninternal and public-facing statements or documents that are \ninconsistent with Title IX, and notify all parents, students, and staff \nof such rescissions and revisions.  \n \n(OCR Discontinuance Letter, pp. 3-4.) \n57.  On September 19, 2025, prior to the expiry of OCR’s three-day deadline, NYCPS \nGeneral Counsel Liz Vladeck responded to the OCR Discontinuation Letter on behalf of the \nNYCPS Chancellor by requesting a 30-day extension of the deadline to consider whether to seek \nreconsideration of OCR’s decision, given that it would be unreasonable to expect NYCPS to \nevaluate the implications of the OCR Discontinuation Letter and its impact on schools, \nprograms, and students within three business days (the “NYCPS Request for Extension”). The \nNYCPS Request for Extension also sought responses to a series of questions to assist NYCPS in \nevaluating its options.  \n58.  In particular, NYCPS raised the following inquiries: \n•  Please explain why the Secretary, in summarily concluding that \nNYCDOE is in violation of Title IX, has deprived the NYCDOE of \nthe procedures and due process required by federal regulations \nbefore discontinuing funding based on alleged non-compliance. \n•  Please explain the nexus between your interpretation of Title IX \nand the MSAP grant funding that is being discontinued. The \npolicies that you cite are not specific to the MSAP and your letter \ndoes not provide a basis for targeting MSAP grants. Nor is it clear \nhow OCR’s interpretation of Title IX impacts the goals of the \nMSAP to expand access and educational opportunities for \nunderserved communities.  \n•  Public statements suggest that only three school districts nationally \nhave been sent letters advising that MSAP grants are being \n  21 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 22 of 48\ndiscontinued. Please explain the basis for selecting these three \ndistricts.  \n•  Please confirm that MSAP grant funding already authorized for \nFiscal Year 25, but not yet spent, may be used as carryover for \nexpenditures made in Fiscal Year 26 for the five Magnet School \nPrograms.  \n•  Please provide us with a copy of the OCR’s written procedures for \nprocessing objections, hearings and appeals, as required by 34 \nC.F.R. 200.342. \n \n(See NYCPS Request for Extension pp. 1-2.) \n \n59.  Assistant Secretary Trainor replied to the NYCPS Request for Extension via a \nshort email on September 20, 2025 (the “Trainor Email”). The Trainor Email rejected NYCPS’ \nrequest for an extension, and refused to provide the requested information, stating that “the \nauthorities cited [in the Discontinuation Letter] speak for themselves.” (Id.) He granted NYCPS \ntwo additional business days—until 5:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, September 23, 2025—to seek \nreconsideration by implementing the remedial measures outlined in the Discontinuance Letter, \nthreatening that “[f]ailure to do so will result in a denial of reconsideration, and my decision not \nto certify NYC DOE’s grant under 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(c) and non-continue its MSAP grant under \n34 C.F.R. § 75.253(a)(5) will stand.” (Id.)  \n2.  The September 26, 2025 Denial of Reconsideration \n \n60.  On Friday, September 26, 2025, the Department, through Lindsey Burke, its \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Programs, wrote to NYCPS Chancellor Melissa Aviles-\nRamos purporting to deny a request for reconsideration of the non-continuation decision that \nNYCPS never actually made (the “Burke Letter”).  \n61.  First, the Department first sought to portray the OCR Discontinuance Letter and \nthe Trainor Email as offering a credible invitation for NYCPS to “submit a reconsideration \nrequest, and the Department would review the submitted material to determine if the request is \naccepted or denied.” Id. \n  22 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 23 of 48\n62.  In reality, as the Burke Letter then admitted, there were preconditions to the \nDepartment’s “offer of an opportunity” to seek reconsideration: “the only requirement being that \nNYC DOE agree to begin to take the remedial steps described in the letter to ensure adequate \ncompliance with federal civil rights law.” By reiterating the prerequisite capitulation for \nreconsideration, the Department continued to deny NYCPS a chance to dispute OCR’s findings, \nand thereby seek meaningful reconsideration of the decision. \n63.  Next, the Burke Letter purported to reconsider the determination by OCR, under \n34 CFR § 75.253(a)(5), as to whether the NYCPS MSAP grant was in the best interest of the \nfederal government. The Burke Letter concluded that based on the same “ongoing civil rights \nconcerns” upon which the Assistant Secretary refused to certify NYCPS’ compliance with civil \nrights laws, reconsideration of the “best interests” determination was denied. Id. Similar to the \nOCR Discontinuation Letter,  in the Burke Letter, the Department again did not consider, let \nalone make any findings, or identify any concerns, about NYCPS’ performance reports, \nperformance measures, or financial data for the prior grant year. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 75.118, \n75.253(b); Discretionary Grantmaking at 32. The Burke Letter also made no reference to the \npurpose of MSAP—including the Congressional findings that continuing to fund MSAP projects \nis in the best interests of the United States. \n64.  Finally, the Burke Letter informed NYCPS for the first time that “the Department \nis electing … not to authorize further no-cost extensions for [NYCPS’ MSAP] grant awards \nidentified for non-continuation.” Id. \n \n3.  The Revised Grant Award Notifications \n \n65.   On Monday, September 29, 2025—three weeks into the current school year—\nwithout any prior notice, the Department issued to NYCPS new Grant Award Notifications for \n  23 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 24 of 48\neach of the five MSAP Projects, resetting the project performance periods for each MSAP grant \nto end on September 30, 2025, and revising the authorized funding for each MSAP grant to the \namount expended on the Project through September 30, 2025. In so doing, the Department \nbarred NYCPS’ MSAP Projects from carrying over into FY26 the unspent funds from FY25. As \nof today, the previously authorized FY25 funding across all of the 5 MSAP Projects available for \ncarryover is approximately $11 million. \n \nF.  The NYCPS Guidance Is Mandated by State and Local Law, and Consistent with Federal \nLaw \n \n1.  Requirements of State Law \n \n66.  Like all public school districts in the state of New York, NYCPS is regulated by \nthe New York State Education Department (“NYSED”). NYSED is headed by the Board of \nRegents, which appoints the State Commissioner of Education to serve as the chief executive \nofficer of “the state system of education,” and among other responsibilities, enforce the laws \nrelating to the system, execute the educational policies determined by the Board of Regents, and \nadvise local school districts as to their duties and the general management of their schools. N.Y. \nEduc. Law § 305(1), (2).   \n67.  The law in New York is clear: it is unlawful to discriminate against people on the \nbasis of their gender identity or gender expression. New York’s Constitution states that “[n]o \nperson shall be denied the equal protection of the laws of this state” and prohibits discrimination \nbecause of “sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, [or] gender expression.” N.Y. \nConst. art. I, § 11(a). The right to equal protection is similarly codified in New York’s Human \nRights Law. See N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 40-c (subjecting any person to any discrimination in his \nor her civil rights, or to any harassment based on, inter alia, gender identity or expression, is \nprohibited). \n  24 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 25 of 48\n68.  New York law includes the categories of sex, sexual orientation, and gender \nidentity or expression as expressly protected from discrimination in employment, education, \nplaces of public accommodation, and other contexts. N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 291, 296. “Gender \nidentity or expression” is defined as “a person’s actual or perceived gender-related identity, \nappearance, behavior, expression, or other gender-related characteristic regardless of the sex \nassigned to that person at birth, including, but not limited to, the status of being transgender.” \nN.Y. Exec. Law §§ 292(35). See also 9 N.Y.C.R.R. § 466.13; 47 R.C.N.Y. § 2-06 (prohibiting \ndiscrimination under the New York City Human Rights Law based on gender identity). \n69.  In the sphere of education, New York prohibits discrimination or harassment \nagainst students on the basis of sexual orientation or gender, and here again, gender means \n“actual or perceived sex and shall include a person’s gender identity or expression.” N.Y. Educ. \nLaw §§ 11-12. Moreover, New York law mandates that “the board of education and the trustees \nor sole trustee of every school district shall create policies, procedures and guidelines that shall \ninclude, but not be limited to: \n1. Policies and procedures intended to create a school environment that is free \nfrom harassment, bullying and discrimination….” \n \nN.Y. Educ. Law § 13 (emphasis added). \n70.  Regulations promulgated by the State Commissioner of Education similarly \nrequire schools to implement a written code of conduct prohibiting harassment, bullying, or \ndiscrimination against students, including based on sex, sexual orientation, or gender, including \ngender identity or expression. 8 N.Y.C.R.R. §100.2(l)(2). In 2015, NYSED issued a Guidance to \nSchool Districts for Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment for Transgender and \n  25 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 26 of 48\nGender Nonconforming Students37 and in 2023 released, Creating a Safe, Supportive, and \nAffirming School Environment for Transgender and Gender Expansive Students: 2023 Legal \nUpdate and Best Practices (together, the “NYSED Guidance”).38 The NYSED Guidance is \nintended to assist New York school districts in complying with New York state law and federal \nlaw, which it interprets as requiring schools to foster an educational environment for all students \nthat is safe and free from discrimination—regardless of sex, gender identity, or gender \nexpression.39 The NYSED Guidance also highlights the existence of guidance from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (“USDE”) and the Department of Justice that Title IX prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex, which has been interpreted to include sexual orientation and \ngender identity.40  \n71.  Moreover, in 2024, the NYSED Office of Counsel issued a Formal Opinion in \nresponse to questions raised about whether New York’s recent Gender Expression Non-\nDiscrimination Act (GENDA) “protects students’ ability to utilize the ‘school restrooms and \nlocker rooms’ that align with their gender.” NYSED’s answer was an emphatic yes: \nGENDA ‘reaffirm[ed]’ New York State’s commitment ‘to assure that every individual \nwithin this state is afforded an equal opportunity to enjoy a full and productive life …’ To \nthat end, it declared discrimination based on ‘gender identity or expression’ an unlawful \npractice under the Human Rights Law. GENDA specifically prohibits public schools \nfrom ‘deny[ing] the use of [their] facilities to any person otherwise qualified, or … \npermit[ting] the harassment of any student or applicant … by reason of … [a person’s] \ngender identity or expression. \n \nRestrooms and locker rooms are unquestionably ‘facilities.’ And denying transgender \nstudents access thereto would be due to, or ‘by reason of,’ their gender identity.

Federal Law – Title IX and the President’s Executive Orders \n \n72.  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), prohibits \ndiscrimination based on sex in federally funded education institutions. In 2021, the Department \npublished interpretive guidance in the Federal Register stating that its Office of Civil Rights \nwould “fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity.” U.S. Department of Education, Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in \nLight of Bostock v. Clayton County, 2021 (the “Title IX Interpretive Guidance”).42 The Title IX \nInterpretive Guidance’s stated purpose was “to clarify the Department’s enforcement authority \nover discrimination based on sexual orientation and discrimination based on gender identity \nunder Title IX.” According to the Guidance, “OCR will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in education programs and \nactivities that receive Federal financial assistance from the Department,” such that OCR will read \nTitle IX to protect an individual who is “harassed, disciplined in a discriminatory manner, \nexcluded from, denied equal access to, or subjected to sex stereotyping in academic or \nextracurricular opportunities and other education programs or activities, denied the benefits of \nsuch programs or activities, or otherwise treated differently because of their sexual orientation or \ngender identity.”43 \n \n41 NYSED, Formal Opinion of Counsel No. 244 (May 14, 2024), publicly available at \nhttps://www.counsel.nysed.gov/sites/counsel/files/244.pdf, at 1 (internal citations omitted). \n42 86 Fed.

Notwithstanding the Department’s published interpretation of Title IX, in January \n2025, President Trump issued three Executive Orders rejecting the Department’s Title IX \nInterpretive Guidance, purporting to announce a new federal interpretation of Title IX, and \nordering agencies to adopt and enforce it (the “Gender Ideology EOs”).44 45 \n74.  The Gender Ideology EOs impose an interpretation of Title IX that rejects \n“gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces” including “use of intimate facilities and \naccommodations such as bathrooms or locker rooms specifically designed for persons of the \nopposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other extracurricular activities \nspecifically designed for persons of the opposite sex.” EO 14168 § 3(f); EO 14190 § 2(e). \nAccording to the Gender Ideology EOs, the new interpretation would be enforced by \n“eliminating Federal funding or support for illegal and discriminatory treatment and \nindoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology,” and “prevent[ing] or \nrescind[ing] Federal funds … from being used by an … elementary school, or secondary school, \nto directly or indirectly … support or subsidize a violation of Title VI or Title IX.” EO 14190 at \n§ 3(iv)(B). \n75.  The Gender Ideology EOs also heralded the January 2025 District Court decision \nin Tennessee v. Cardona, 762 F. Supp. 615, 627-628 (E.D. Ky. 2025), in which a District Court \nin Kentucky vacated a 2024 Final Rule issued after notice and comment by the Department \nunder President Biden46 that had, inter alia, codified the Department's understanding that sex \n \n44 See Executive Order (“EO”) 14168 – Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth \nto the Federal Government, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 20, 2025); EO14190 – Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling, \n90 Fed. Reg. 8853 (Jan. 29, 2025); and EO 14201 – Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports, 90 Fed. Reg. 9279 (Feb. 5, 2025). \n45 EO 14168 went so far as to direct Agency heads to “promptly rescind all guidance documents inconsistent with the \nrequirements of this order or the Attorney General’s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such \ndocuments that are inconsistent in such manner,” including the Title IX Interpretive Guidance. EO 14168 at § 7(c) \n46 89 Fed. Reg. 33474(Apr. 29, 2024). \n  28 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 29 of 48\ndiscrimination includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity. \n76.  On February 4, 2025, OCR issued a Dear Colleague Letter (“DCL”) purporting to \nannounce a pivot in the federal government’s enforcement of Title IX, consistent with EO 14168, \nin which “President Trump ordered all agencies and departments within the Executive Branch to \n‘enforce all sex-protective laws to promote [the] reality’ that there are ‘two sexes, male and \nfemale,’ and that ‘[t]hese sexes are not changeable….’”47 The DCL announced: “ED and OCR \nmust enforce Title IX consistent with President Trump’s Order.”48 \n77.  Notwithstanding the purpose and content of the Gender Ideology EOs and the \nDCL, the Department has neither revoked the Title IX Interpretive Guidance, nor replaced it by \npublishing a revised interpretation in the Federal Register. \n3.  New York State’s Response to the Gender Ideology EOs \n \n78.  On February 5, 2025, the New York Attorney General and NYSED jointly issued \nguidance for New York schools, including NYCPS, on their continuing obligations to prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity and/or gender expression, as required by New \nYork law, notwithstanding the Gender Ideology EOs issued by President Trump. See Joint \nStatement of the Office of the Attorney General and the State Education Department Regarding \nTransgender Students’ Rights (“Joint Statement”).49  \n79.

NYCPS Guidelines to Support Transgender and Gender Expansive Students  \n \n80.  In compliance with New York state law, and consistent with existing federal, \ngovernmental, and judicial interpretation of Title IX, NYCPS maintains policies for its school-\nbased and central staff that support transgender and gender expansive students. NYCPS’ current \nGuidelines to Support Transgender and Gender Expansive Students52 have been in place since \n2019, however prior versions go back as far as 2014. The NYCPS Guidelines set out a protocol \nand best practices for records, names and pronouns, curriculum, and resources, as well as access \nto restrooms, locker rooms, sports and physical education, and other circumstances. Consistent \nwith federal and New York state law—and as directed by the New York Attorney General and \nNYSED —the NYCPS Guidelines state that students must be given access to facilities and \npermitted to participate in all school activities in accordance with their gender identity asserted at \nschool.  \n81.  The NYCPS Guidelines also reflect a commitment to ensure a safe learning \nenvironment for all students free from discrimination and harassment. They recognize that \n \n50 Id. GENDA amended NY Executive Law, Civil Rights Law, and Education Law to prohibit discrimination based on \ngender identity and expression. \n51 Id. (quoting Kansas v. Dep’t of Educ., 739 F.

Kansas 2024)). \n52 NYCPS, Guidelines to Support Transgender and Gender Expansive Students, publicly available at \nhttps://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/school-environment/guidelines-on-gender/guidelines-to-support-transgender-and-\ngender-expansive-students. \n  30 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 31 of 48\ntransgender and gender expansive students are at high risk for being bullied and marginalized \nand that schools must foster a culture of respect that values all students. To accomplish that goal, \nthe NYCPS Guidelines require that schools assess the needs of each student individually, and \naddress, on a case-by-case basis, any requests for arrangements to address individual student and \nfamily privacy concerns. Under the Guidelines, when families have a concern, they contact their \nschool and they are assisted to find a resolution that will keep their children safe.  \nG. The Department’s Discontinuation of the MSAP Grants Violated Governing Statutes and \nRegulations Failing to Provide NYCPS the Process Required by Title IX \n \n82.  The Discontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP Projects based on NYCPS’ alleged \nviolation of Title IX—without notice, investigation, hearing, or opportunity to respond, and \nwithout a valid substantive basis—is both a misuse of MSAP’s intended grant continuation \ncertification and performance review processes, as well as a blatant attempt to avoid the exacting \nprocess required by law to adjudicate a Title IX violation.  \n83.  The Department, through the actions taken by the Acting Assistant Secretary, and \nthe Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Programs to effectuate the Discontinuation, has plainly \ntried to sidestep the mandated Title IX process by misusing MSAP’s grant continuation review \nprocess. OCR, while purporting to refuse to certify compliance with the Projects’ assurances \nrequired under MSAP, in fact engaged in a wholesale assessment of NYCPS’ Guidelines \nunrelated to MSAP and refused to certify them. Relying on that improper “finding,”, the \nDepartment then further subverted the process by discontinuing the NYCPS’ MSAP grants, \nabridging the performance period for those grants, and refusing to permit a no-cost extension that \nwould have allowed an orderly wind-down of the Schools’ 5-year plans and minimized harm to \nstudents using the FY25 carryover funds. As a result, this Discontinuation is not only unlawful, \n  31 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 32 of 48\nbut is also being carried out in a manner that maximizes the harm to the very students the MSAP \ngrants are designed to support.  \n84.  First, OCR’s refusal to certify the MSAP Projects’ compliance with federal civil \nrights, purportedly pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(c), is impermissible Title IX enforcement in \ncircumvention of Congressionally mandated procedural guardrails. Although OCR’s refusal to \ncertify is based on NYCPS’ operation writ large, the statutory provision upon which OCR relies \nrequires the certification of only certain narrow aspects of the Projects’ and their Schools’ \noperation. In particular: \n(b) Each application submitted under subsection (a) shall include— \n… \n(2) assurances that the applicant will— \n… \n(C) not engage in discrimination based on race, religion, color, national origin, \nsex, or disability in— \n(i) the hiring, promotion, or assignment of employees of the applicant or other \npersonnel for whom the applicant has any administrative responsibility; \n(ii) the assignment of students to schools, or to courses of instruction within \nthe schools, of such applicant, except to carry out the approved plan; and \n(iii) designing or operating extracurricular activities for students; \n… \n(c)  No grant shall be awarded under this part unless the Assistant Secretary of Education \nfor Civil Rights determines that the assurances described in subsection (b)(2)(C) will \nbe met. \n20 U.S.C. § 7231d(b)-(c). \n \n85.  That OCR has purported to have reviewed not the specific operations about which \nthe Projects made assurances, as described in 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(b)(2)(C)53, but NYCPS’ \nDistrict-wide policy, makes clear that this was not a certification decision tied to the Projects’ 20 \nU.S.C. § 7231d(c) assurances, but rather, an attempt at wholesale Title IX enforcement.  \n \n53 For example, 20 U.S.C. § 7231d(b)(2)(C) provides that the “applicants” are required to submit assurances of non-\ndiscrimination. Moreover, the statute contemplates—and appears to authorize—and applicant to engage what might be \nconsidered “discrimination” based on protected categories in connection with the assignment of students to schools, or to \ncourses of instruction within the schools, “to carry out the approved [desegregation] plan.”   \n  32 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 33 of 48\n86.  Second, the Department purports to discontinue funding the MSAP Projects \npursuant to 34 C.F.R. 75.253, which requires that in order to receive a continuation award, \nrecipients must “receive a determination from the Secretary that the continuation of the project is \nin the best interest of the federal government.” 34 C.F.R. 75.253(a)(5). \n87.  However, the Department made no mention whatsoever in its notices to NYCPS \nof the factors specifically prescribed by the MSAP regulations to determine the “best interest” of \nthe federal government: NYCPS’ performance reports, performance measures, or financial data \nfor the prior year. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 75.118, 75.253(b); Discretionary Grantmaking at 32. Nor \ndid the Department reference extensive Congressional findings about the ways in which \ncontinued funding of magnet schools through MSAP is in the best interests of the United States. \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 7231(a).  \n88.  Instead, the Department premised the Discontinuation solely on NYCPS’ alleged \nviolations of Title IX—skipping to the enforcement stage of a Title IX determination without \nproviding any of the statutorily required procedural protections to get there. The statutory and \nregulatory provisions effectuating Title IX are clear: actions taken in enforcement of Title IX \nmay only be undertaken by following the prescribed procedural protections. The Department’s \nbrazen attempt to circumvent this process cannot be reconciled with the best in interests of the \nUnited States, nor can it stand under Title IX.  \n89.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefit of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a). Federal agencies are “authorized and directed” to enforce § 1681 in a number of ways, \nincluding “by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue [financial] assistance…to any \n  33 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 34 of 48\nrecipient as to whom there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for a \nhearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement.” 20 U.S.C § 1682. \n90.  As the Department well knows, before any decision54 can be taken to discontinue, \nterminate, or revoke financial assistance as a result of a violation of Title IX, an agency must \n“advise[] the appropriate person or persons of failure to comply with the requirement and [] \ndetermin[e] that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means,” must collect evidence and \nhold a hearing, and finally, must “file with the committees of the House and Senate having \nlegislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the \ncircumstances and the grounds for such action.” Id. Further, “[n]o such action shall become \neffective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report. Id. Any such action is then \nsubject to judicial review in the appropriate federal district court. Here, NYCPS was denied the \nprocess mandated by Title IX at every turn. \n91.  Despite cloaking unlawful conduct as a legitimate exercise of the Assistant \nSecretary’s “unique ability to examine a MSAP grantee’s prospective compliance with \napplicable federal civil rights law,” Burke Letter at 1, the Department has failed to identify any \nconcern regarding the past or planned programs or policies specific to the operation of the MSAP \nSchool grantees or described in their annual performance reports, as contemplated by the MSAP \nor Title IX regulatory schemes.55  Instead, the Department points to the existence of the NYCPS \n \n54“Any decision” includes a Title IX administrative proceeding to terminate or refuse to grant or continue federal financial \nassistance for an applicant who fails or refuses to furnish assurances of compliance with federal civil rights law. See 34 \nC.F.R. § 100.8(b), (noting that “the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings, where \nsuch assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part”).   \n55 As the FY 22 MSAP NIA provides, a continuation award “considers whether the grantee is operating in compliance with \nthe assurances in its approved application….” (87 Fed. Reg. 9595 (Feb. 22, 2022) (emphasis added). In addition, 20 U.S.C. § \n1682 provides for refusal to continue financial assistance “to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding on \nthe record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement, but such termination or refusal shall \nbe limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made, and \nshall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found….” Id. \n(emphasis added). \n  34 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 35 of 48\nGuidelines, protections for transgender and gender expansive students required by law and in \neffect well before the Schools were approved and recertified multiple times for their MSAP \ngrants. \n92.  Moreover, the NYCPS Guidelines have been in place in some form for over a \ndecade, without OCR ever raising concerns about them, despite the Assistant Secretary then in \noffice having had, the entire time, on dozens and dozens of occasions, the same “unique ability \nto examine [NYCPS MSAP grantees’] prospective compliance with applicable federal civil \nrights law.” With each such opportunity to examine and certify NYCPS Projects’ compliance \nwith federal civil rights compliance since the NYCPS Guidelines were issued in 2014, OCR has \nfailed to raise any concern about the Guidelines.  \nH. NYCPS is Harmed by the Discontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP Grants \n \n93.  The Department’s Discontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP grants is already \nhampering NYCPS’ ability to operate its 19 fledgling MSAP-funded magnet schools, cutting \nthem adrift by (1) precluding NYCPS from accessing approximately $11 million in unspent \ncarryover FY25 federal funds to support the current operation of the nineteen magnet schools; \nand (2) casting ongoing planning for the magnet schools into doubt for the remainder of each \nProject’s 5-year grant period by discontinuing federal funding for the Schools. \n94.  In the initial years of their MSAP grants, each of the nineteen schools, all of \nwhich received their initial MSAP funding in either FY22 or FY23, made significant investments \nto develop programmatic and curricular themes like STEAM; college readiness; teaching; \njournalism; visual, performing, and multimedia arts; and leadership. Discontinuing the grants \nabruptly, without warning, during the current school year, gave the MSAP Projects no \nopportunity to plan for prioritization of programming or curtailment of financial commitments. \nMany of the services and programming that have been developed will be discontinued. \n  35 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 36 of 48\n95.  The abrupt cancellation of the MSAP grants imperils every student’s 2025-2026 \nschool year and unfairly undermines the availability of the unique educational opportunities they \nwere promised when they enrolled. The Schools’ students have applied for and enrolled in these \nschools in reliance on the promise and expectation of a five-year federal commitment to support \nthe innovative and thematic curricula, purchase of equipment, development of specialized \nclassrooms and partnerships with outside entities designed to provide exceptional learning \nenvironments and improved academic outcomes. Students who selected these magnet schools \nbecause of the creative nature of the programming will find the core elements of their chosen \neducational path to have disappeared. This will be a huge loss to the students, staff and parents at \nthese schools.   \n96.  As a direct result of the Department’s unlawful decision to discontinue NYCPS’ \nMSAP grant funds, the educational programs at each of these Schools—and the children enrolled \nin them—will suffer. The thousands of students that have been benefiting from these programs \nwill see their educational programs transform to much poorer offerings (literally and \nfiguratively) overnight, with the school year well under way. This will undoubtedly impact both \ntheir immediate academic performance and achievement, their social emotional development and \ntheir overall engagement with school. \n97.  Moreover, in connection with establishing these programs, the Schools took on \nliabilities for ongoing costs such as salaries of magnet school personnel, including magnet school \nprogram directors and teachers, and contracts with consultants. If the MSAP grants are not \npromptly restored to NYCPS, the Schools will have to immediately begin to wind down their \nprograms going forward, ensuring that all current magnet program students in grades K-11 will \nlose the benefit of these programs which have been designed to continue through the course of \n  36 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 37 of 48\ntheir education, until they graduate. Unknown numbers of future students who would have \npursued these programs will not have those opportunities.  \n98.  Discontinuing the grants after providing only two or three years of the expected, \nCongressionally mandated, 5-years of financial support also severely reduces any hope of long-\nterm sustainability for these programs because it prevents the schools from being able to fully \ndevelop their capacity to continue as self-sustaining magnet schools. \n99.  The Schools face adverse impacts even beyond the losses that will be sustained by \nthese students and their school communities. Without the planned investment from federal funds, \nthe Schools will become less appealing to prospective families, who are likely to pursue different \noptions, decreasing overall enrollment.  \nV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act through \nAgency Action Without Observance of Procedure Required by Law (Title IX)) \n \n100.  NYCPS incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs. \n101.  Section 706 of the APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \nan agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be … without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n102.  The Department is an “agency” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nDiscontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP grants constituted final agency action subject to review \nunder the APA.  \n103.  While Congress authorized federal agencies to enforce compliance with the \nrequirements of their Title IX rules and regulations, “[n]o order suspending, terminating or \nrefusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until … there \nhas been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the \n  37 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 38 of 48\napplicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed” by Title IX. 34 CFR § 106.81 \n(incorporating by reference 34 CFR § 100.8(c)); 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n104.   After completion of those procedures, the Department must also, before taking an \naction to terminate, or to refuse to grant or continue federal financial assistance, “file with the \ncommittees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity \ninvolved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action,” and “[n]o \nsuch action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.” \n20 U.S.C § 1682. \n105.  Congress expressly declared that any action by a department or agency \nterminating financial assistance is subject to judicial review, that “any State or political \nsubdivision thereof and any agency of either” may obtain judicial review, and that the federal \nagency’s action “shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1683. \n106.  The Discontinuation was effectuated without following the statutory and \nregulatory requirements of Title IX. There was no investigation; there has been no express \nfinding on the record of a failure by NYCPS to comply with Title IX; and the Department also \nfailed to provide an opportunity for a hearing to NYCPS prior to any such finding. \n107.  The Department also took these actions without filing the requisite report with \nCongress and waiting the required 30-day period after filing the report. \n108.  Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, NYCPS is entitled to \na declaratory order and an order and judgment enjoining the Department’s Discontinuation of \nNYCPS’ MSAP grants as in violation of the procedures required by law; and rescinding, \nvacating and setting aside such Discontinuation; and an order enjoining the Department from \nimplementing, maintaining or reinstating such Discontinuation. \n  38 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 39 of 48\nCOUNT II \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act through Agency \nAction Without Observance of Procedure Required by Law \n(MSAP, GEPA, 2 C.F.R. § 200)) \n \n109.  NYCPS incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs. \n110.  Section 706 of the APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \nan agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be … without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n111.  The Department is an “agency” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nDiscontinuation constituted final agency action subject to review under the APA. \n112.  The Discontinuation was governed by the MSAP statute and its implementing \nregulations (20 U.S.C. §§ 7231-7231j; 34 C.F.R. § 280.1-280.41), GEPA and the Education \nDepartment General Administrative Regulations (“EDGAR”) (20 U.S.C. § 1221 et seq.; 34 \nC.F.R. § 75 et seq.), the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit \nRequirements for Federal Awards (2 C.F.R. § 200 et seq.), and the statutes and regulations \ngoverning OCR (20 U.S.C. § 1682; 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; 34 C.F.R. § 100.1 et seq.). \n113.  Prior to the Discontinuation, the Department was required to provide notice of the \ngrounds for its decision not to continue the grants, and to provide NYCPS with the opportunity to \nchallenge the decision and request reconsideration. 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(g); 2 C.F.R. § 200.342.  \n114.  The Department effectuated the Discontinuation without following these statutory \nand regulatory requirements. By conditioning NYCPS’ ability to seek reconsideration on \ncapitulation to the Department’s demands that it repudiate the NYCPS Guidelines and take \nremedial steps, the Department denied NYCPS a meaningful opportunity to seek reconsideration \nof the finding that the Guidelines violates Title IX.56  \n \n56 To the extent the Department’s agency action actually effectuated a termination of NYCPS’ MSAP grants, rather than a \ndiscontinuation, OCR failed to comply with the requirements of 2 C.F.R. Part 200 governing the whole or partial termination \n  39 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 40 of 48\n115.  Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, NYCPS is entitled to \na declaratory order and an order and judgment enjoining the Department’s Discontinuation of \nNYCPS’ MSAP grants as in violation of the procedures required by law; and rescinding, \nvacating and setting aside such Discontinuation; and an order enjoining the Department from \nimplementing, maintaining or reinstating such Discontinuation. \n \nCOUNT III \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act through \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n \n116.  NYCPS incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs. \n117.  The APA requires that the Court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n118.  The Department is an “agency” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nDiscontinuation constituted final agency action subject to review under the APA. \n119.  An agency action is arbitrary or capricious where it is not “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). An agency \nmust provide “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (citation modified). Moreover, “[t]he change-in-\nposition doctrine” prevents agencies from “mislead[ing] regulated entities.” FDA v. Wages & \nWhite Lion Invs., 604 U.S. 542, 567 (2025). “Under that doctrine, ‘[a]gencies are free to change \ntheir existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change,’ ‘display \n \nof a federal award for non-compliance. Specifically, the Department discontinued NYCPS’s MSAP grants without a \ndetermination that any alleged non-compliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, as required by 2 \nC.F.R. § 280.339. Moreover, the Part 200 regulations required the Department to provide NYCPS notice and an opportunity \nto object to and provide information and documentation challenging the termination action. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340–41. \n  40 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 41 of 48\nawareness that [they are] changing position,’ and ‘consider serious reliance interests.’” Id. at 544 \n(quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221–22  (2016)). \n120.  The decision to discontinue NYCPS’ MSAP grants is arbitrary and capricious \nbecause the Department did not articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \n“rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n, 463 U.S. at 43; Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019). First, the \nDepartment acted irrationally in that it failed entirely to consider the factors specifically \nenumerated in the MSAP regulations to determine whether to make a continuation award, \nincluding on the basis of the “best interest” of the federal government: NYCPS’ performance \nreports, performance measures, or financial data for the prior year. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 75.118, \n75.253(b).  \n121.  Second, the non-continuation “best interests” determination was seemingly made \nwithout reference to the express Congressional findings about the ways in which continued \nfunding of magnet schools through MSAP is in the best interests of the United States. See 20 \nU.S.C. § 7231(a)(4) (finding that it is in the best interests of the United states “to continue the \nFederal Government's support of … local educational agencies that are voluntarily seeking to \nfoster meaningful interaction among students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, \nbeginning at the earliest stage of such students' education,” “to ensure that all students have \nequitable access to a high quality education that will prepare all students to function well in a \ntechnologically oriented and a highly competitive economy comprised of people from many \ndifferent racial and ethnic backgrounds,” and “to continue to desegregate and diversify schools \nby supporting magnet schools, recognizing that segregation exists between minority and \nnonminority students as well as among students of different minority groups”). \n  41 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 42 of 48\n122.  Third, the Department’s Discontinuation referenced a novel interpretation of Title \nIX that is not supported by any law, is contrary to the determinations of multiple federal circuit \ncourts and is contrary to the New York State Constitution and statute. In support of their contention, \nthe Department references only Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. 2022) \nand Tennessee v. Cardona, 762 F. Supp. 3d 615 (E.D. Tenn. 2025), both of which examined the \nexact opposite issue: whether Title IX in fact requires that schools allow equal access by \ntransgender students to facilities consistent with their gender identity. These court did not rule, and \nno court has held, that Title IX requires that schools restrict equal access by transgender students, \nand the Department has not offered any reasoned explanation of its new interpretation. \n123.  The Discontinuation is also arbitrary and capricious because the Department \nviolated the “[t]he change-in-position doctrine,” by failing to provide a reasoned explanation for \nthe change,’ [and] failing to ‘display awareness that [they are] changing position.’ Wages & White \nLion Invs., 604 U.S. at 567 (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC, 579 U.S. at 221–22).  The \nDepartment’s Discontinuation fails entirely to recognize that the NYCPS Guidelines, the \nsubstance of which has been in place in various iterations since 2014, has never before been \nadjudged by the Department to violate Title IX. The notices of Discontinuation also fail to \nacknowledge that their decision here to the contrary represents a change in position by the \nDepartment, without a reasoned explanation. \n124.  The Discontinuation also violates the change-in-position doctrine because the \nDepartment failed to account for the serious reliance interests of NYCPS. Id. NYCPS has \nstructured its budget with the understanding and expectation that the Department would make \nannual continuation awards through the remainder of the project performance period based on \nthe MSAP Projects’ performance, consistent with the Department’s expressed priorities at the \ntime of the application, as expressed in the Notice of Invitation to Apply. Discretionary \n  42 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 43 of 48\nGrantmaking at 31–32. NYCPS has also structured its budget with the understanding that, \nconsistent with Congressional intent in creating MSAP, and in extending the grant period to 5 \nyears, it would have the benefit of several more years to generate performance results and \nidentify and build relationships with new sources of funding that would allow it to continue its \nprojects in a self-sustaining fashion following the end of the federally funded performance \nperiod.  \n125.  NYCPS’s reliance is based on, among other things, clear Congressional intent that \nMSAP projects be funded for 5 years, and the Department’s past history and practice under \nMSAP, and MSAP’s governing regulations, all of which reflect an “intention to make \ncontinuation awards to fund the remainder of the project period” for 5 years upon approval of \nmulti-year grants, 34 C.F.R. § 75.251(b)(2). See also, e.g., 59 Fed. Reg. 30259 (June 10, 1994) \n(explaining that a cut-off in continuation award funding is “extremely rare in practice”); 89 Fed. \nReg. 33474 (Aug. 29, 2024) (explaining that, “[i]n general, we do not deny a large number of \nnon-competing continuation awards and, if that does happen, grantees are often aware of the \nlikelihood of the decision well in advance”). Believing that discontinuances would be based on \ncriteria within its control—i.e. its performance—NYCPS invested time and resources to develop \nmagnet schools that will have the full benefit of the five-year term to develop, which allows for \nthe programs to be sustaining even after grant funding has ended. Instead, all of the planning, \ntraining and development will now be lost due to discontinuances based on improper criteria \noutside the NYCPS MSAP Projects’ control. 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(b). \n126.  The Department also failed to account for the reliance interests of the MSAP \nProgram’s participants and beneficiaries: students—with the support of their parents—have \nchosen to enroll in the MSAP-funded Schools with the expectation that the magnet school \nfunding by the Department will continue through the 5-year project term, consistent with federal \n  43 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 44 of 48\nlaw, to allow the realization of all of the benefits of the carefully-designed and planned magnet \nprogram. Students enrolled in the Schools expecting to have access to project-based learning, \ndedicated spaces (such as media rooms, laboratories, podcast studios, gardens), and partnerships \nwith outside entities like the Columbia University Division of Technology and School Change, \nCarnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. High School Students at the Jacqueline \nKennedy Onassis STEAM Magnet School of Business Careers, and Esperanza Early College \nExploration and Leadership Magnet School have been planning to pursue the early completion of \ncollege credits, and receive college and career readiness support, financial literacy training, and \npaid internship opportunities. Middle schoolers attending the Magnet School of Leadership, \nExploration and the Arts in Brooklyn are expecting access to coursework associated with an \ninternational baccalaureate program. Others chose to attend the Schools to have opportunities to \nlearn from full-time, specialized engineering/STEM instructors, or to develop an active student \nnewspaper and morning news station, or to train in a state-of-the-art fabrication lab or recording \nstudio. To abruptly discontinue the grants funding the magnet Schools, mid-stream, fails to take \ninto account the reliance of these students and their families. \n127.  Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, NYCPS is \nentitled to a declaratory order and an order and judgment enjoining the Department’s \nDiscontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP grants as contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious and an \nabuse of discretion; rescinding, vacating and setting aside such Discontinuation; and enjoining \nthe Department from implementing, maintaining or reinstating such Discontinuation. \nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D) through Agency \nAction without Notice and Comment Rulemaking) \n \n128.  NYCPS incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs. \n  44 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 45 of 48\n129.  The APA requires that a reviewing court “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, findings, and conclusions found to be … without observance of procedure required by \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n130.  “The APA generally requires that before a federal agency adopts a rule it must \nfirst publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register and provide interested parties with an \nopportunity to submit comments and information concerning the proposal.” N.H. Hosp. Ass’n v. \nAzar, 887 F.3d 62, 70 (1st Cir. 2018) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553). “Failure to abide by these \nrequirements renders a rule procedurally invalid.” Id. \n131.  Under GEPA, the Department is required to follow the APA’s notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking procedure when changing rules guiding its enforcement of Title IX. See 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1221e-4, 1232. \n132.  The Department cannot purport to adopt and act upon a new interpretation of Title \nIX which guides the enforcement of Title IX with respect to discrimination based on gender \nidentity without following the proper procedures. \n133.  Without having proceeded through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the \nDepartment has purported to adopt and act upon an interpretation of Title IX with respect to \ndiscrimination based on gender identity to effectuate its Discontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP \ngrants and its actions are procedurally invalid under the APA. \n134.  Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, NYCPS is entitled to \na declaratory order and an order and judgment enjoining the Department’s Discontinuation of \nNYCPS’ MSAP grants as in violation of the procedures required by law; and rescinding, \nvacating and setting aside such Discontinuation; and an order enjoining the Department from \nimplementing, maintaining or reinstating such Discontinuation. \n \n  45 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 46 of 48\nCOUNT V \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D) through Agency \nAction Contrary to Law) \n \n135.  NYCPS incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs. \n136.  The APA requires that the Court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n137.  The Department is an “agency” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the \nDiscontinuation constituted final agency action subject to review under the APA. \n138.  An agency’s action is contrary to law in the absence of statutory authorization for \nits act. Hikvision USA, Inc. v. FCC, 97 F.4th 938 (D.C. Cir. 2024). It may not rewrite clear \nstatutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate. Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. \nEPA, 573 U.S. 302, 328 (2014). \n139.  The Department's Discontinuation of the NYCPS's MSAP grants is contrary to \nlaw because it is based on a novel interpretation of Title IX, is entirely unsupported by any law, \nand contravenes the findings of several federal circuit courts that Title IX at the very least allows \nschools to permit transgender students to use facilities consistent with their gender, and in some \ncases actually requires such. See, e.g., Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586 (4th \nCir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020), reh’g en banc denied, 976 F.3d 399 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (June 28, 2021) (affirming a grant of summary judgment that a \nschool district policy that prohibited a transgender boy from using the boy’s bathroom violated \nTitle IX); A.C. v. Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th 760 (7th Cir. 2023) (affirming a \npreliminary injunction preventing the application of a policy denying a transgender student \naccess to the bathroom consistent with their gender identity). \n  46 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-08547     Document 1     Filed 10/15/25     Page 47 of 48\n140.  In matters of statutory interpretation, courts are required to exercise independent \njudgment rather than deference to administrative agencies’ interpretations. Loper Bright \nEnterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 391, 412-13 (2024). \n141.  The Department's determination that the NYCPS Guidelines violate Title IX is \ncontrary to the decisions from multiple Circuit Courts that gender-inclusive policies for \nrestrooms and other facilities are, at the very least, permitted, if not required. conforming \nfacilities is required by Title IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination. See Doe v. Boyertown Area \nSch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518 (3d Cir. 2018) (affirming denial of preliminary injunction to plaintiff \nstudents who challenged policy permitting transgender students’ access to gender-conforming \nbathrooms, in decision issued from the bench); Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210 (9th \nCir. 2020) (affirming the dismissal of similar claims).  \nVI.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff NYCPS prays that the Court: \na.  Declare and order that the Department’s Discontinuation of NYCPS’ MSAP grants be \nrescinded, vacated and set aside as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and an abuse \nof discretion, and as having been undertaken without observance of procedures required \nby law; \nb.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Department from implementing, maintaining, \nor reinstating the Discontinuation, or otherwise taking any other action to suspend, \nterminate, or refuse to continue the NYCPS’ MSAP grants for the FY25 and FY26 \nperiods; \nc.
