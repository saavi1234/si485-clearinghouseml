RUBIO, in his official capacity \nas Secretary of State \n2201 C Street, NW  \nWashington, D.C. 20520, \n \nDefendants. \n \nCOMPLAINT \nPlaintiff the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America brings this action for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and alleges as follows:  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 2 of 49\nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The United States is unique in its ability to attract the brightest talent from across \nthe globe. For more than 70 years, what is now known as the H-1B visa program has enabled the \nUnited States to harness this magnetic draw. Tens of thousands of highly skilled people in special-\nized fields boost the American economy each year after obtaining H-1B status. These workers \nallow businesses of all sizes, in industries across the economy, to innovate and grow. The resulting \ninnovations lead to more American jobs, higher wages, and new products and services that im-\nprove the quality of life for all Americans.  \n2.  The H-1B program is a creature of statute, which Congress has meticulously main-\ntained and modified over decades. The goal, from the start, has been to maximize the benefits of \nthe program for the American people while also ensuring that American workers do not face a \ncompetitive disadvantage in the national workforce. That is, Congress has focused on making this \nprogram available to employers seeking workers with specialized skills not available in the United \nStates while preventing H-1B abuse and the displacement of American workers. To that end, it has \nstruck an intricate, thoughtful balance by specifying how fees for the program should be calculated, \nhow many visas may be issued annually, and what requirements the executive branch should en-\nforce to ensure that H-1B workers do not displace American workers or undercut wages.  \n3.  The presidential proclamation at issue in this action, Restriction on Entry of Certain \nNonimmigrant Workers (Sept. 19, 2025) (the Proclamation), upends that carefully crafted congres-\nsional balance. The centerpiece of the Proclamation is the imposition of a $100,000 fee on all new \npetitions filed by United States employers intending to hire foreign workers through the H-1B \nprogram. By comparison, prior to the Proclamation, most H-1B petitions cost less than $3,600.  \n4.  If implemented, that fee would inflict significant harm on American businesses, \nwhich would be forced to either dramatically increase their labor costs or hire fewer highly skilled \nemployees for whom domestic replacements are not readily available. While Congress made the \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 3 of 49\nprogram generally available for domestic employers, this new fee would make it no longer eco-\nnomically viable for many, primarily smaller businesses. Indeed, a fee of $100,000 would signifi-\ncantly reduce participation in the program, resulting in fewer employers being able to access the \nhighly skilled workers they need to continue to innovate and create American jobs.  \n5.  These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America’s economic \nrivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States. That \nis a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back.   \n6.  The Proclamation is not only misguided policy; it is plainly unlawful. The President \nhas significant authority over the entry of noncitizens into the United States, but that authority is \nbounded by statute and cannot directly contradict laws passed by Congress. \n7.  The Proclamation does precisely that: It blatantly contravenes the fees Congress \nhas set for the H-1B program and countermands Congress’s judgment that the program should \nprovide a pathway for up to 85,000 people annually to contribute their talents to the United States \nfor the betterment of American society. As fully set forth herein, other problems abound.  \n8.  Because the Proclamation exceeds the President’s lawful authority, it must be en-\njoined as to Plaintiff and its members, and any implementing agency action must be held unlawful \nand set aside.  \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America (the U.S. \nChamber) is the world’s largest business federation. It represents approximately 300,000 direct \nmembers and indirectly represents the interests of more than 3 million companies and professional \norganizations of every size, in every industry sector, and from every region of the country. An \nimportant function of the U.S. Chamber is to represent the interests of its members before Con-\ngress, the executive branch, and the courts. To that end, the U.S. Chamber regularly litigates on \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 4 of 49\nbehalf of its members in federal court. The U.S. Chamber is a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization \nheadquartered in Washington, D.C. \n10.  Defendant the United States Department of Homeland Security is the federal de-\npartment with substantial responsibility for immigration policy and enforcement. The Proclama-\ntion charges the Department of Homeland Security with certain aspects of its implementation. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security is integral to execution of the Proclamation’s imposition of a \n$100,000 fee on new H-1B visas. The Department of Homeland Security is headquartered in \nWashington, D.C. \n11.  Defendant the United States Department of State is the federal department charged \nwith conducting foreign relations, including by issuing visas to noncitizens. The Proclamation \ncharges the Department of State with certain aspects of its implementation. The Department of \nState is integral to execution of the Proclamation’s imposition of a $100,000 fee on new H-1B \nvisas. The Department of State is headquartered in Washington, D.C.  \n12.  Defendant Kristi L. Noem is the Secretary of Homeland Security. She is sued in \nher official capacity. \n13.  Defendant Marco A. Rubio is the Secretary of State. He is sued in his official ca-\npacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  Plaintiffs bring this suit under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-\n2202, the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq., the Administrative Procedure \nAct, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., and this Court’s inherent equitable power. \n15.  It is within this Court’s inherent equitable power to enjoin actions by federal offic-\ners in excess of their lawful authority, including when acting pursuant to a presidential directive. \nChamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“We think it is now well \nestablished that ‘[r]eview of the legality of Presidential action can ordinarily be obtained in a suit \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 5 of 49\nseeking to enjoin the officers who attempt to enforce the President’s directive.’”) (quoting Franklin \nv. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 828 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part)); id. (“[C]ourts have \npower to compel subordinate executive officials to disobey illegal Presidential commands.”) (quo-\ntation marks omitted); see Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as this case arises under the \nlaws of the United States.  \n17.  Venue lies in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(e)(1)(A)-(C) be-\ncause this action seeks relief against federal agencies and officials acting in their official capacities, \nat least one defendant is located in this district, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the \nclaim occurred in this district, and plaintiff resides in this district and no real property is involved.   \n18.  The U.S. Chamber has standing to bring this action under the doctrine of associa-\ntional standing. See, e.g., Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 333 (1977). \nMany of the U.S. Chamber’s members of all sizes, and across a wide spectrum of economic sec-\ntors, use the H-1B program. They count H-1B visa holders among their valued employees, and \nplan to continue sponsoring future hires for visas through the H-1B process, including in the next \nannual H-1B visa lottery, which will occur in March 2026 and therefore is encompassed within \nthe Proclamation’s effective period. U.S. Chamber members use the H-1B program to access em-\nployees with specialized, often technical skills that are in high demand—and therefore in short \nsupply—domestically.   \n19.  The imposition of a new $100,000 fee to continue using that program is thus a \nconcrete harm suffered by the numerous U.S. Chamber members who participate in the program. \nSome members are unable to pay that fee and therefore must either reduce or entirely forgo their \nplanned entries into the March 2026 lottery—thereby giving up the benefits of the program in \nterms of access to specialized talent and likely leaving difficult-to-fill positions empty. That creates \nripple effects across the business, including forgone opportunities and loss of competitiveness. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 6 of 49\nOther members who find a way to pay a $100,000 per-employee fee will be harmed too, incurring \nthe “classic pocketbook injury” (Tyler v. Hennepin Cnty., 598 U.S. 631, 636 (2023)) of paying \nmoney to the government. And paying the fee will require members to divert resources and de-\ncrease investments in other areas. \n20.  Either way, the U.S. Chamber’s members who intend to sponsor H-1B employees \nthis year are the object of the Proclamation’s $100,000 fee requirement—as they are the parties \nnow required to pay the fee—and therefore would have standing to sue in their own right. See, \ne.g., Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 606 U.S. ___, 145 S. Ct. 2121, 2134 \n(2025) (“[I]f a plaintiff is ‘an object of the action (or forgone action) at issue,’ then ‘there is ordi-\nnarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury, and that a judgment prevent-\ning or requiring the action will redress it.’” (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561-\n562 (1992))). \n21.  This action is also germane to the U.S. Chamber’s purpose of representing the in-\nterests of American business in court. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 333; see also, e.g., Healthy Gulf v. U.S. \nDep’t of Interior, __ F.4th ___, 2025 WL 2486119, at *5 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 29, 2025) (“Germaneness \nrequires ‘pertinence between litigation subject and organizational purpose.’”) (indirectly quoting \nHumane Soc’y of U.S. v. Hodel, 840 F.2d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. 1988)); Hodel, 840 F.2d at 58 (ger-\nmaneness requirement is “undemanding”).  \n22.  The U.S. Chamber frequently represents members in both advocating business-\nfriendly policies and challenging executive actions that will negatively affect business, including \nagency action that imposes unreasonable costs on doing business or that impedes a company’s \nability to hire well-qualified employees, innovate, and create jobs. The U.S. Chamber, through its \nLitigation Center, “fights for business at every level of the U.S. judicial system, on virtually every \nissue  affecting  business.”  Chamber  Litigation  Center,  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce  (2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/WH3T-JXRP. And the supply of highly qualified labor is one of the fundamental \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 7 of 49\ninputs to any business; ensuring that supply is therefore well within the U.S. Chamber’s advocacy \nmission. See generally U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Topics: Immigration (describing the U.S. \nChamber’s efforts in advocating for immigration policies that allow businesses to flourish), \nhttps://perma.cc/S4TA-3ZJD; U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Major Initiatives: America Works In-\nitiative (describing the Chamber’s major initiative to address the “worker shortage crisis” by “help-\ning employers across the country develop and discover talent,” including through the “related \ntopic[]” of “immigration”), https://perma.cc/EG35-52F9.  \n23.  Thus, for example, the U.S. Chamber has brought several successful lawsuits (along \nwith other business associations) on behalf of its members, challenging executive action that \nthreatened to undermine the H-1B program. See generally Chamber of Com. of the U.S. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 4:20-cv-7331 (N.D. Cal. 2020); Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Homeland Sec., No. 4:20-cv-4887 (N.D. Cal. 2020). And the U.S. Chamber regularly partici-\npates in the notice-and-comment process when DHS or other agencies conduct rulemaking relating \nto business-relevant immigration policies in general, and to the H-1B program in particular. See, \ne.g., U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Comment on Modernizing H-1B Requirements, Providing Flex-\nibility in the F-1 Program, and Program Improvements Affecting other Nonimmigrant Workers \n(Dec. 22, 2023), https://perma.cc/FK9V-9RT2; U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Comment on Estab-\nlishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant \nAcademic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Media (Sept. 26, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/B2RV-EUA2. \n24.  Finally, the participation of the U.S. Chamber’s individual members is unnecessary, \nas this action seeks only declaratory, injunctive, and vacatur relief. See, e.g., United Food & Com. \nWorkers Union Loc. 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 546 (1996) (“[I]ndividual participation \nis not normally necessary when an association seeks prospective or injunctive relief for its mem-\nbers” as opposed to “an action for damages to an association’s members.”) (quoting Hunt 432 U.S. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 8 of 49\nat 343); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

Legal background. \n1.  The H-1B Program. \n25.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) governs the admission of noncitizens \ninto the United States. See generally 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq. Among other things, the INA pro-\nvides for various categories of nonimmigrant visas for noncitizens planning to enter the United \nStates temporarily and for a specific purpose. See id. §§ 1101(a)(15), 1184. Nonimmigrant visas \nare distinct from immigrant visas, which are issued to those intending to become permanent resi-\ndents of the United States. \n26.  First enacted in 1952, what is today known as the H-1B visa program makes avail-\nable a nonimmigrant visa for a noncitizen “who is coming temporarily to the United States to \nperform services . . . in a specialty occupation.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). A “specialty \noccupation” is one that requires “theoretical and practical application of a body of highly special-\nized knowledge, and . . . attainment of a bachelor’s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or \nits equivalent).” Id. § 1184(i)(1); see also 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(ii). \n27.  The process of applying for an H-1B visa is governed by 8 U.S.C. § 1184 and re-\nlated regulations. \n28.  The INA provides that the “importing employer” must submit a petition for a \nnonimmigrant visa “in such form and contain[ing] such information as the [Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity] shall prescribe.” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(c)(1). \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 9 of 49\n29.  An employer must also complete the labor condition application process. The em-\nployer must certify to the Department of Labor that (among other things) the company will pay its \nH-1B employee, at a minimum, the greater of “the actual wage level paid by the employer to all \nother individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in ques-\ntion” or “the prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of employment.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(n)(1)(A)(i); see generally 20 C.F.R. part 655 (DOL regulations governing labor \ncondition application process). \n30.  The “prevailing wage” is calculated by assessing the “skill level” of the proposed \nH-1B worker and corresponding wages for workers in the occupation and location in which the \nemployer is seeking to employ the H-1B worker, based on statistics compiled by the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics. See Strengthening Wage Protections for the Temporary and Permanent Employ-\nment of Certain Aliens in the United States, 85 Fed. Reg. 63,872, 63,875-63,876 (Oct. 8, 2020); \nsee also 8 U.S.C. § 1182(p)(4).  \n31.  Since 1990, Congress has maintained a cap on the total number of available H-1B \nvisas that may be issued each year. Presently (with some exemptions),1 the statutory cap allows \n65,000 noncitizens to obtain H-1B nonimmigrant status per year, with an additional 20,000 visas \nper year available to individuals with an advanced degree from a U.S. higher education institution. \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1184(g). \n32.  Because demand for H-1B visas far outstrips the number of visas available—for \nfiscal year 2026, more than 336,153 people registered against a cap of 85,000—the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) traditionally has implemented a lottery system to \n \n1   Universities and their affiliated nonprofit entities (such as university health systems) and non-\nprofit and government research organizations are exempt from the numerical cap, and may submit \nH-1B petitions outside of the lottery procedure discussed below. See 8 U.S.C. § 1184(g)(5)(A), \n(B). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 10 of 49\ndetermine which petitions would be processed. If the number of H-1B petitions filed exceeded the \nnumerical quota for that year in the first five business days of the designated petition submission \nwindow, USCIS would select randomly among all petitions filed on those first five days. See 8 \nC.F.R. § 214.2(h)(8)(ii)(B) (prior to Apr. 1, 2019). \n33.  In 2019, USCIS implemented a “registration” system that requires a U.S. employer \nto register electronically for each person for whom they intend to file an H-1B petition. 8 C.F.R. \n§ 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(1). If USCIS receives more registrations than the number of available visas, \nthe agency runs a lottery among the registrations to determine who can file an H-1B petition. After \nUSCIS notifies an employer that its registration has been selected, the employer has 90 days to file \nits H-1B petition. \n34.  The lottery occurs every March. The next lottery to follow the implementation of \nthe Proclamation will occur in March 2026.  \n35.  The fees associated with H-1B petitions are set by USCIS through notice-and-com-\nment rulemaking and are governed by statutory provisions. Relevant statutory provisions include \n8 U.S.C. § 1356(m), which says that “fees for providing adjudication and naturalization services \nmay be set at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing all such services, \nincluding the costs of similar services provided without charge to asylum applicants or other im-\nmigrants. Such fees may also be set at a level that will recover any additional costs associated with \nthe administration of the fees collected.” Presently, fees that USCIS has assessed under its Section \n1356(m) authority include a registration fee to enter the H-1B lottery (8 C.F.R. § 106.2(c)(11)), a \nfiling fee for the form (I-129) used to submit an H-1B petition (id. § 106.2(a)(3)), and an asylum \nprogram fee (id. § 106.2(c)(13)). Depending on the size of the employer, these fees can add up to \nas much as $1,595.  \n36.  In addition to the fees set by USCIS through notice-and-comment rulemaking pur-\nsuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m), Congress has also set multiple specific fees for H-1B petitions by \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 11 of 49\nstatute, including a $1,500 fee for most employers to file the petition (8 U.S.C. § 1184(c)(9)(A)-\n(C)) and an additional $500 fee to fund fraud prevention measures (id. § 1184(c)(12)(A)-(C)). \n37.  Additionally, in 2010, Congress imposed by statute an additional fee of $2,000 on \ncertain H-1B petitions. Pub. L. No. 111-230, § 402(b), 124 Stat. 2485, 2487 (2010). The fee was \nincreased to $4,000 in 2015. Pub. L. No. 114-113 § 402(g), 129 Stat. 2242, 3006 (2015) (codified \nat 49 U.S.C. § 40101 note, Airline Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, Sec. 411).2 \nEmployers covered by this fee are those that employ more than 50 workers in the United States, \nand more than half of whose U.S. workforce is composed of H-1B or L-1 employees (a visa cate-\ngory used for intracompany transferees). Id. \n38.  Congress also has provided for “premium processing” fees for immigration ser-\nvices—currently $2,805 for H-1B petitions—under which sponsoring employers can have peti-\ntions processed within a shorter timeframe. 8 U.S. § 1356(u)(3); See USCIS Fee Schedule (Aug. \n29, 2025) at 32, https://perma.cc/U7D4-5VS9.  \n39.  Prior to the Proclamation, the total fees associated with filing an H-1B petition, \nincluding both USCIS-set fees and statutory fees, generally amounted to approximately $3,600 \n(excluding the optional premium processing fee and the additional $4,000 fee for H-1B-reliant \nemployers). See USCIS Fee Schedule, supra, at 6, 39-40.  \n40.  After USCIS approves an H-1B petition, if an applicant is outside the United States, \nhe or she must apply for an H-1B visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad before traveling to \nthe United States. If granted, an H-1B visa is good for three years and is eligible for one extension \nof the same duration. See U.S.C. § 1184(g)(4); 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(A). \n \n2   This $4,000 additional fee was initially set to sunset in 2025, but Congress later extended the \nsunset date until September 30, 2027. See Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-123, \n§ 30203(b), 132 Stat. 64, 126. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 12 of 49\n41.  Congress has carefully calibrated the H-1B visa system to the needs of the domestic \neconomy. For example, as noted, the law contains labor protections designed to ensure that H-1B \nvisas do not become a vehicle for displacing well-qualified Americans.  \n42.  Before hiring a noncitizen through the H-1B program, a company must make vari-\nous certifications to the Department of Labor regarding prevailing labor conditions. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(n)(1)(A)-(D). An employer must attest, among other things, that the position pays prevail-\ning wages, that the position will not adversely affect other workers, and that the employer has \nprovided to existing employees certain forms of notice regarding the petition, including by physi-\ncal posting. These certification requirements are backed up by monetary fines and bans on further \nvisa applications. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(n)(2)(C). \n43.  Employers with a history of willful certification violations or a large percentage of \nworkers already on H-1B visas must additionally certify that the company has tried and failed to \nfill the position with a domestic worker, and that it has not and will not displace a U.S. worker \nwithin the 180-day period surrounding the date of the application. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(n)(1)(E), \n(n)(1)(G), (n)(3)(A); see also 20 C.F.R. § 655.736.  \n44.  For example, an employer with 51 or more U.S. employees must make these addi-\ntional certifications—that U.S. workers were not available to fill the position and that it has not \nand will not displace U.S. workers in a 6-month period—if 15 percent or more of its employees \nare in H-1B status. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(n)(1)(E), (n)(1)(G), (n)(3)(A)(iii). \n45.  Since 1990, the law also has imposed an annual cap on the total number of new H-\n1B visas that can be issued each year, to prevent the American workforce from being overwhelmed \nwith highly competitive noncitizen workers. See 8 U.S.C. § 1184(g). \n46.  At the same time, Congress has been attuned to “the need of American business for \nhighly skilled, specially trained personnel to fill increasingly sophisticated jobs for which domestic \npersonnel cannot be found and the need for other workers to meet specific labor shortages.” H.R. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 13 of 49\nRep. 101-723, pt. 1, at 41 (Sept. 19, 1990). It enacted the modern H-1B statute based on the con-\nviction “that immigration can and should be incorporated into an overall strategy that promotes \nthe creation of the type of workforce needed in an increasingly competitive global economy with-\nout adversely impacting on the wages and working conditions of American workers.” Id. \n47.  In other words, the relevant statutory provisions struck an intentional balance be-\ntween the hiring needs of businesses and protections for American workers. Indeed, the govern-\nment itself has recognized that “the broad intent of the Act is clear. . . . [It] seeks to make the \nimmigration system more efficient and responsive to the needs of employers experiencing labor \nshortages, while at the same time providing greater safeguards and protections for both U.S. and \nalien workers.” Alien Temporary Employment Labor Certification Process, 56 Fed. Reg. 11,705, \n11,706- 11,707 (Mar. 20, 1991). \n48.  Congress’s repeated statutory amendments adjusting the H-1B program—without \nchanging its essential nature—reaffirm this fundamental principle. \n49.  In making one such statutory adjustment—instituting a temporary increase in the \ncap on H-1B visas—the Senate Report accompanying the American Competitiveness in the \nTwenty-First Century Act expressly noted that H-1B visas are essential to growing the number of \nAmerican jobs: \nCritics of H-1B visas claim that they result in taking away jobs from Americans \nand giving them to foreigners. In fact, however, failure to raise the H-1B ceiling is \nwhat will deprive Americans of jobs. This is because artificially limiting compa-\nnies’ ability to hire skilled foreign professionals will stymie our country’s economic \ngrowth and thereby partially atrophy its creation of new jobs. . . . Many of the con-\ncerns about H-1B visas revolve around the fear that individuals entering on H-1B \nvisas will ‘‘take’’ a job from an American worker. This fear arises from the premise \nthat there is a fixed number of jobs for which competition is a zero-sum game. But \nthis premise is plainly flawed[.] \nS. Rep. 106-260, at 11-12 (Apr. 11, 2000). \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 14 of 49\n50.  In 2004, Congress specifically addressed appropriate limitations on the H-1B visa \ncategory via the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004. 118 Stat. 2809, 3353-61 §§ 421-430. This Act, \namong other things, revised prevailing wage requirements, adjusted the number of visas available \nby adding a set-aside for individuals completing U.S. graduate degrees, and otherwise calibrated \nthe program to meet the needs of the domestic economy. \n51.  Most recently, as noted, Congress in 2010 and again in 2015 responded to the po-\ntential for H-1B visa abuse by imposing a temporary surcharge fee of $4,000 on certain employers \nwith a high proportion of H-1B visa holders as employees. Pub. L. No. 111-230, § 402(b), 124 \nStat. 2485, 2487 (2010); Pub. L. No. 114-113 § 402(g), 129 Stat. 2242, 3006 (2015). \n52.  These recent and ongoing congressionally enacted adjustments to the program re-\nflect Congress’s active and engaged decisionmaking about how the program is designed and ought \nto operate, as well as Congress’s reaffirmation of the program’s fundamental goals and purpose.   \n2.  The President’s authority under the INA. \n53.  Congress, in the INA, provided the President certain authority. Under Section \n212(f) of the INA:  \nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens \ninto the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he \nmay by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the \nentry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose \non the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). \n54.  And Section 215(a) of the INA provides that it is unlawful “for any alien to . . . enter \nthe United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such \nlimitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.” 8 U.S.C. § 1185(a)(1). Any policy-\nmaking authority stemming from this provision “substantially overlap[s]” with the President’s au-\nthority under Section 212(f). Trump v. Hawaii, 85 U.S. 667, 693 n.1 (2018). \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 15 of 49\nB.  Factual Background. \n1.  Importance of H-1B workers. \n55.  H-1B visas are critical to the success and growth of American businesses. \n56.  It is estimated that as many as 730,000 H-1B visa holders currently work in spe-\ncialized fields across the American economy. These workers contribute enormously to American \nproductivity, prosperity, and innovation.  \n57.  Meanwhile, the United States suffers from a well-documented labor shortage. As \nrecent research by the U.S. Chamber has shown, “[n]early every state is facing an unprecedented \nchallenge finding workers to fill open jobs.” Understanding America’s Labor Shortage: The Most \nImpacted States, U.S. Chamber of Commerce (Dec. 13, 2024), https://perma.cc/ZMJ6-BNF5. In \nthe most-affected states, for example, the number of job openings is more than double the number \nof unemployed workers. Id.; see also, e.g., Arturo Castellanos Canales, America's Labor Shortage: \nHow Low Immigration Levels Accentuated the Problem and How Immigration Can Fix It, National \nImmigration Forum (February 28, 2022), https://perma.cc/B9UA-KA3M.  \n58.  The skilled labor shortage is even more acute in certain industries. For example, the \nUnited States faces a serious shortage of doctors: One report estimated that the United States will \nface a shortage of between 54,100 and 139,000 physicians by 2033. See Association of American \nMedical Colleges, The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: Projections From 2018 to \n2033 (June 2020), https://perma.cc/36P9-PS2R). The H-1B program helps fill that gap. See, e.g., \nPeter A. Kahn & Tova M. Gardin, Distribution of Physicians With H-1B Visas By State and Spon-\nsoring Employer, JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association (June 6, 2017) (noting \nthat there are roughly 10,000 H-1B approvals annually for physicians), https://perma.cc/3FN5-\nFLE9.  \n59.  Individuals entering the United States via H-1B visas also are integral to the land-\nscape of higher education. In 2020, more than 28,000 H-1B-related labor condition applications \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 16 of 49\nwere filed for higher education, confirming the central importance of these programs. Alex \nNowrasteh, Don’t Ban H-1B Workers: They Are Worth Their Weight in Innovation, Cato at Liberty \n(May 14, 2020) (summarizing and linking to several leading studies), https://perma.cc/SMW4- \nUUJT; see ¶¶ 29-30, supra (describing labor condition application process). \n60.  American firms, particularly in manufacturing and certain STEM (science, technol-\nogy, engineering, and mathematics) fields, also face a shortage of domestic workers qualified and \navailable to fill the roles needed for the companies to perform. For example, in 2016, “13 STEM \njobs were posted online for each unemployed worker that year—or roughly 3 million more jobs \nthan the number of available, trained professionals who could potentially fill them.” New Ameri-\ncan Economy Research Fund, Sizing Up the Gap in our Supply of STEM Workers: Data & Analysis \n(Mar. 29, 2017), https://perma.cc/4BZR-ED9S.3 \n61.  And “having the workers to fill such jobs” through nonimmigrant visa programs \nlike H-1B “allows American employers to continue basing individual operations or offices in the \nUnited States, a move that creates jobs at all levels—from the engineers and computer program-\nmers based in American offices to the secretaries, HR staff, and mailroom employees that support \nthem.” Partnership for a New American Economy, The H-1B Employment Effect: H-1Bs awarded \nbetween 2010-2013 will create more than 700,000 jobs for U.S.-born workers by 2020 1-2 (2015), \nhttps://perma.cc/C6T2-6TKZ. \n62.  One comprehensive study evaluating the productivity impacts from H-1B visas in \n219 American cities showed that an increased number of H-1B visa holders in a city resulted in \n \n3   See also, e.g., Deloitte & The Manufacturing Institute, The jobs are here, but where are the \npeople?: Key findings from the 2018 Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute skills gap and future \nof work study 2 (2018) (“[R]esearch reveals an unprecedented majority (89 percent) of executives \nagree there is a talent shortage in the US manufacturing sector.”), https://perma.cc/W2ND-RRLB; \nid. at 3 fig. 2 (“[The p]ersistent skills shortage could risk US$2.5 trillion [in] economic output over \nthe next decade.”).  \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 17 of 49\nproductivity gains.

Those productivity gains translate into jobs created. A recent study demonstrated \nthat, at the individual firm level, each H-1B lottery win resulted not just in increased noncitizen \nemployment, but a corresponding increase in native-born employment at the lottery-winning firm \nas well. Parag Mahajan et al., The Impact of Immigration on Firms and Workers: Insights from the \nH-1B Lottery 25 (May 2025) (“H-1B hires seem to crowd-in other workers, such as non-college \nworkers of all nativities, as lottery-winning firms expand their usage of workers outside of the \nimmigrant college group.”), https://perma.cc/F9AE-BEJC. \n64.  H-1B visa petitions are associated with higher rates of new product innovation. \nGaurav Khanna & Munseob Lee, High-Skill Immigration, Innovation, and Creative Destruction, \nNat’l Bureau of Economic Research (2018), perma.cc/QE87-KDAC. Across the country, H-1B \nworkers “directly increase the production of knowledge through patents, innovation, and entrepre-\nneurship.”  Alex Nowrasteh, Don’t Ban H-1B Workers: They Are Worth Their Weight in Innova-\ntion, Cato at Liberty (May 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/SMW4-UUJT.  \n65.  That innovation is a boon to the American economy, and ultimately American \nworkers. One 2019 study found that between 2000 and 2015, the foreign-born share of STEM \nprofessionals in the United States—many of them attributable to the H-1B program—created an \nestimated benefit of $103 billion for American workers, largely due to the development of new \ntechnologies that increase the productivity and wages of U.S.-born workers. Christian Gunadi, An \ninquiry on the impact of highly-skilled STEM immigration on the U.S. economy, 61 Labour Eco-\nnomics (2019), https://perma.cc/U39W-P2SZ. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 18 of 49\n66.  As a result, the H-1B program has empowered tremendous growth and value crea-\ntion in American firms. Indeed, a 2025 analysis of H-1B data from 2008 to 2020 showed that “H-\n1B workers contribute to firm value creation” through forces including “innovation” and “enhanc-\ning operational efficiency.” Jiang, et al., Skilled Foreign Labor, Urban Agglomeration, and Value \nCreation, working paper at 22 (February, 19, 2025), https://perma.cc/9VWK-592B. Accordingly, \nafter 12 years, “the nominal value of a dollar invested in [firms with high H-1B applications]” had \ngrown by 1000%, three times the value created by firms with no H-1B applications. Id.  \n67.  The H-1B program is vital to the success of American manufacturing—the largest \nworkforce sector in the United States. A 2021 analysis focusing on the manufacturing industry \nconcluded that the H-1B program, by promoting a “qualified educated labor force,” is critical for \nthe manufacturing sector to “be competitive on the global stage.” Eron Gjoci, Empirical evidence \nagainst U.S. H1-B visa restrictions, the case of employment in the manufacturing industry, work-\ning paper at 21 (Nov. 16, 2021), https://perma.cc/7356-6W44. \n68.  Relatedly, research shows that “participation of foreign-born workers in the Amer-\nican labor market has a positive effect on American trade with foreign nations.” Nadia Almasalkhi, \nHigh-Skilled Immigration Workers Benefit American Industry, But U.S. Policies Threaten Them, \nBerkely Interdisciplinary Migration Initiative 1 (September 11, 2023) https://perma.cc/RUY2-\nGER6. That is attributable to, among other factors, the “language skills, cultural competency, and \ntransnational personal networks of foreign-born high skilled workers,” which are a “boon for busi-\nnesses operating in fast-moving and competitive industries like technology,” as well as the ability \nof high-skilled foreign-born workers to “facilitate the international flow of knowledge.” Id.  \n69.  Research shows that at least three factors explain the link between robust high-\nskilled immigration and economic growth—first, individuals likely to be hired under an H-1B visa \nhave an overabundance of entrepreneurship and innovative talent; second, high-skilled temporary \nworkers tend to focus in “quantitative skills and STEM fields,” which are specialties that fuel \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 19 of 49\ngrowth; and third, high-skilled temporary workers are often instrumental in the creation of new \ntechnologies.

Davis Global Migration Center Policy Brief 2 (July \n2020), https://perma.cc/3B6B-25YU. \n70.  For precisely these reasons, many of the U.S. Chamber’s members rely on the H-1B \nprogram and have benefited enormously from the program in ways that have allowed those com-\npanies to create better well-paying jobs for American workers.  \n2.  The Proclamation. \n71.  The President issued the Proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmi-\ngrant Workers, on September 19, 2025.  \n72.  The preamble of the Proclamation cites an alleged “large-scale replacement of \nAmerican workers through systemic abuse of the [H-1B] program.” It alleges that certain employ-\ners “have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages resulting in a \ndisadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more diffi-\ncult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact \nseen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.”  \n73.  The Proclamation points to a doubling of “foreign STEM workers,” the “key facil-\nitator” of which, it claims, has been “abuse of the H-1B visa.” In particular, the Proclamation \naccuses “Information Technology (IT) firms” of “manipulat[ing] the H-1B system, significantly \nharming American workers in computer-related fields.”  \n74.  Citing rising unemployment rates of IT workers overall, the Proclamation asserts \nthat H-1B visas “are not being used to fill occupational shortages or obtain highly skilled workers \nwho are unavailable in the United States.” Instead, the Proclamation charges H-1B employers with \n“undercut[ting] the integrity of the program” to the “detriment[] [of] American workers’ wages \nand labor opportunities,” “prevent[ing] American employers in other industries from utilizing the \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 20 of 49\nH-1B program in the manner in which it was intended,” and creating “a national security threat” \nby encouraging fraud and discouraging Americans from pursuing STEM careers. \n75.  The preamble concludes that it is “therefore necessary to impose higher costs on \ncompanies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while \nstill permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.” \n76.  Section 1(a) of the Proclamation, citing Sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, \nstates that “the entry into the United States of aliens as nonimmigrants to perform services in a \nspecialty occupation under [the H-1B program] is restricted, except for those aliens whose peti-\ntions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment of $100,000,” subject to certain exceptions.  \n77.  Section 1(b) states that “[t]he Secretary of Homeland Security shall restrict deci-\nsions on petitions not accompanied by a $100,000 payment for H-1B specialty occupation work-\ners,” and further directs the Secretary to “issue guidance, as necessary and to the extent permitted \nby law, to prevent misuse of B visas by alien beneficiaries of approved H-1B petitions that have \nan employment start date beginning prior to October 1, 2026.” \n78.  Section 1(c) states that the $100,000 fee requirement “shall not apply to any indi-\nvidual alien, all aliens working for a company, or all aliens working in an industry, if the Secretary \nof Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary’s discretion, that the hiring of such aliens to be \nemployed as H-1B specialty occupation workers is in the national interest and does not pose a \nthreat to the security or welfare of the United States.”  \n79.  Section 2(b) of the Proclamation requires the Secretary of State to “verify receipt” \nof the $100,000 fee and “approve only those visa petitions for which the filing employer has made \nthe payment.”  \n80.  Section 2(c) states that “[t]he Department of Homeland Security and the Depart-\nment of State shall coordinate to take all necessary and appropriate action to implement this \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 21 of 49\nproclamation and to deny entry to the United States to any H-1B nonimmigrant for whom the \nprospective employer has not made the payment described in section 1 of this proclamation.”  \n81.  The effective date of the Proclamation was September 21, 2025, and it expires 12 \nmonths thereafter. Within 30 days of the upcoming March 2026 H-1B lottery, however, Section \n3(b) of the Proclamation directs the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of \nLabor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly submit to the President a recommenda-\ntion on whether to extend the $100,000 fee.   \n3.  The Proclamation’s devastating effect on businesses using the H-1B program. \n82.  Moments after the announcement of the Proclamation, panic rippled through the \nUnited States economy. With the Proclamation set to take effect days later, H-1B visa-holders \ntraveling abroad scrambled to make emergency trips back to the United States for fear of losing \ntheir legal status. Companies employing H-1B workers sought to understand the far-ranging im-\nplications for their present and future workforces.  \n83.  Though the White House eventually clarified that the Proclamation’s imposition of \na $100,000 fee applies only to future petitions for new H-1B visas, and thus does not affect current \nvisa-holders or petitions for H-1B renewal, the thunderbolt of the Proclamation had already had \nits effect: The American business community was on notice that soon one of the best tools at its \ndisposal for recruiting high-skilled workers when American workers are not readily available \nwould be prohibitively expensive.  \n84.  For many members of the U.S. Chamber, the Proclamation will have far-reaching \neffects.  \n85.  American businesses use programs like the H-1B program because the domestic \nsupply of highly skilled workers is not large enough to keep apace with the demands of innovation. \nCertainly, the United States is home to many high-skilled workers. But it is also home to much of \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 22 of 49\nthe world’s innovation and knowledge generation. And as a result, the domestic supply of high-\nskilled workers is frequently insufficient to meet employers’ needs. See, e.g., ¶ 60 & n.3, supra. \n86.  U.S.-based employers turn to the H-1B visa to make up the difference. \n87.  With prohibitive limitations on such workers, employers in STEM-focused indus-\ntries will be hit especially hard. Many of the largest tech companies in the United States currently \nhave thousands of H-1B employees and hire new employees through the program each year. Mean-\nwhile, highly innovative start-ups and small businesses are particularly reliant on the program and \nwill be especially hard-pressed to afford a $100,000 fee. \n88.  In an interview after the Proclamation’s announcement, one Silicon Valley-based \ntech startup founder offered this somber assessment:  \nIt diminishes our innovative capacity in the United States. It tells other brilliant \npeople around the world that we are not open for innovation.  \nI can say that as long as this is in place, we’re not going to be able to afford to do it \nanymore. It’s a catastrophe. This additional fee is a non-starter for start-ups and \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses.  \nBay Area Tech Leaders Warn New $100,000 H-1B Visa Fee Could Impact Innovation, KPIX (Sept. \n21, 2025) https://perma.cc/2SMX-RF3S.  \n89.  A prominent venture capitalist investing in start-ups offered a similar assessment: \n“There is not a single company that I have invested in the last 10 years that could afford to pay \nthis.” Madeline Ngo et al., Trump’s $100,000 Visa Fee Spurs Confusion and Chaos, New York \nTimes (Sept. 20, 2025), https://perma.cc/6F9G-NUS4. \n90.  That sentiment is widespread. Indeed, many members of the U.S. Chamber are \nbracing for the need to scale back or entirely walk away from the H-1B program, to the detriment \nof their investors, customers, and their own existing employees.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 23 of 49\n91.  That is to say nothing of the many universities, health systems, and other non-profit \nresearch-driven institutions that also rely on H-1B visas and certainly cannot afford a new \n$100,000 fee per H-1B employee. \n92.  Employers that do continue to use the program will do so at a steep cost that sharply \nincreases the price of labor and correspondingly reduces the company’s ability to invest resources \nelsewhere, including in new innovations.  \n93.  Ultimately, Americans would pay the heaviest price. Shuttered or scaled-back do-\nmestic innovation means far fewer U.S.-based jobs, less demand for American workers, and, as a \nresult, lower wages. It also means fewer ground-breaking innovations available to improve the \nlives of U.S. consumers.  \nDISCUSSION \nA.  The Proclamation exceeds the President’s authority. \n94.  The Proclamation intends to radically alter the H-1B program. Though purporting \nto impose a mere “payment,” the new $100,000 fee for employers will dramatically reduce the \nnumber of H-1B petitions being filed: It drastically increases prospective labor costs, and basic \neconomics dictates that companies will therefore hire fewer H-1B workers. Indeed, that is the \nstated intent of the Proclamation, which is aimed at reducing the pool of H-1B applicants to “the \nbest of the best,” as measured by the imperfect analogue of their employers’ ability and willingness \nto pay the government a six-figure sum.  \n95.  That result—and the means taken to implement it—is flatly contrary to Congress’s \ndirectives, as stated throughout the INA. Congress has created, long maintained, and periodically \nmodified the H-1B program based on its judgment that bringing highly skilled noncitizen workers \nto the United States benefits the Nation by driving innovation and creating jobs. That has proven \nundoubtedly true. See ¶¶ 55-70, supra.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 24 of 49\n96.  Congress has meticulously defined how the H-1B program is to be implemented. \nFor instance, it has detailed the principles USCIS should use to set fees associated with H-1B \npetitions, and just recently amended the law to impose a fee on the heaviest users of the H-1B \nprogram that is twenty-five times smaller than the blanket fee the President now aims to impose.  \n97.  Congress also has defined by statute how many people should be able to enter the \nUnited States under the program via cap-subject visas: in total, 85,000 annually—a carefully cali-\nbrated statutory cap calculated to maximize the program’s benefits for the American people while \nensuring that highly skilled U.S.-based workers remain competitive in the workforce. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1184(g). Congress arrived at this figure through titration over multiple pieces of legislation, \nagainst the background knowledge that demand for visas vastly exceeds that amount. Most re-\ncently, Congress temporarily increased the cap to 195,000 annually for fiscal years 2001-2003 via \nthe American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act. Pub. L. 106-313, § 102(a), 114 \nStat. 1251 (2000); see 8 U.S.C. § 1184(g)(1)(A).4 And Congress did so knowing that demand for \nH-1B visas exceeds supply. See S. Rep. 106-260, at 2 (“Despite the increase in the H-1B ceiling \nin 1998, a tight labor market, increasing globalization and a burgeoning economy have combined \nto increase demand for skilled workers even beyond what was forecast at that time. As a result, \nthe 1998 bill has proven to be insufficient to meet the current demand for skilled professionals.”). \nCf., e.g., United States v. Wilson, 290 F.3d 347, 354 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (considering “the contextual \nbackground against which Congress was legislating” as an interpretive aide). \n98.  Relatedly, Congress established elaborate standards to protect American workers, \nsuch as the statutory cap and the labor condition application process, designed to ensure that H-1B \n \n4   This law also established that universities and their nonprofit affiliates are exempt from the \ncap. Pub. L. 106-313, § 103, 114 Stat. at 1252. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 25 of 49\nvisas do not become a means to undercut wages or put Americans at a competitive disadvantage. \nSee ¶¶ 29-31, 41-45, supra. \n99.  The Proclamation upends that careful balancing. It fundamentally alters the H-1B \nprogram by tacking on a plainly disproportional fee that expressly contradicts the more modest \nfees Congress has sought to impose, which are aimed explicitly at recovery of costs. And it re-\nplaces Congress’s determination of the optimal annual number of new noncitizen workers (85,000, \nplus additional cap-exempt workers) with an onerous fee that will cause a significant reduction in \nparticipation in the program and may leave many H-1B spots unclaimed.  \n100.  Although the President has authority under the INA, that authority does not, and \ncannot, empower him to override existing statutory provisions and programs. Nor does it authorize \nthe President to create new visa conditions in general—nor new fees in particular—under the guise \nof a restriction on “entry” under Section 212(f).  \n1.  The Proclamation expressly overrides provisions of the INA that govern the H-1B pro-\ngram.  \n101.  The President’s authority under Section 212 of the INA to restrict noncitizens from \nentering the United States, while broad, is not unlimited. Specifically, the Supreme Court has “as-\nsume[d] that § 1182(f) does not allow the President to expressly override particular provisions of \nthe INA.” Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 689 (2018). And other courts have extended that as-\nsumption into an express holding: A Section 212(f) proclamation cannot “effectively rewrit[e] \nprovisions of the INA” or “eviscerate[] the statutory scheme.” Doe #1 v. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, \n1064, 1067 (9th Cir. 2020). \n102.  In other words, Section 212(f) “cannot plausibly be read to authorize the President \n… to supplant” the express provisions of the INA. Refugee & Immigrant Ctr. for Educ. & Legal \nServs. v. Noem, 2025 WL 1825431, at *20 (D.D.C. 2025). The President lacks “authority to alter \nthe rules” created by Congress or render other INA provisions “dead letters.” Id. at 32, 35. Indeed, \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 26 of 49\neven Congress cannot provide the President authority to override prior statutory enactments. See, \ne.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 447 (1998) (Line Item Veto Act was unconstitu-\ntional because it “g[ave] the President the unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted \nstatutes.”); Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524, 525 (1838) (“[V]esting \nin the President a dispensing power”—that is, “clothing the President with a power to control the \nlegislation of congress”—“has no countenance for its support in any part of the constitution.”). \n103.  At bottom, the President may not use his control over entry into the United States \nto supplant or nullify Congress’s statutorily enacted immigration policy. Doing so is an ultra vires \nact, and one over which courts have inherent authority to order injunctive relief. See, e.g., Trudeau \nv. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 456 F.3d 178, 189-190 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Fleming v. Moberly Milk Prods. \nCo., 160 F.2d 259, 264 (D.C. Cir. 1947); Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585.   \n104.  The H-1B program is the product of careful congressional balancing, reflecting \nseveral core policy determinations by Congress. Most obviously, Congress itself has set what it \nfelt were the appropriate fees for the H-1B program and has delegated authority to the executive \nbranch to impose additional fees only under certain conditions, including a cost-recovery principle \nand a requirement of notice-and-comment rulemaking. Plainly, the Proclamation’s new $100,000 \nper-petition fee meets neither condition.   \n105.  Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, Congress has concluded that the program \nshould exist, and in the robust form it prescribed. Congress statutorily created the H-1B program \nin order to allow employers to bring a certain number of highly skilled, specialized noncitizen \nworkers to the country. That is good for American business, and it is good for American workers, \nwho benefit from the well-paying jobs that result from economic growth and productivity. And \nthe program’s maximum benefit is realized when enough specialized workers can enter the United \nStates to deliver those economic benefits but sufficient protections exist to ensure that Americans \nare not disadvantaged by the hiring of those workers.    \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 27 of 49\n106.  The Proclamation overrides that balance. It replaces Congress’s design—expressed \nin duly enacted statutory text—with an altogether different approach that undercuts the very exist-\nence of the program. \n107.  These clashes between the statutory design of the H-1B program and the Proclama-\ntion are reflected in the Proclamation’s direct contradiction of the fees authorized by Congress, as \nwell as its conflict with other aspects of the program.  \na.  Explicit fee provisions. \n108.  To begin, the Proclamation directly contradicts express provisions of the INA—\nmost obviously, the specific fees that Congress deemed to be appropriate and therefore set for the \nH-1B program.  \n109.  Congress has set a clear baseline rule governing fees for immigration programs: \nThe executive may charge fees for visas and related services sufficient to fund its activities related \nto those services, but no more than that. See 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m) (also known as INA § 286(m)). \n110.  Prior to 1988, the immigration functions of the Department of Justice, carried out \nby the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, were funded from appropriations. See gen-\nerally U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule, 75 Fed. Reg. 58,962, 58,966 (Sept. \n24, 2010). That year, Congress enacted Section 1356(m) “to provide an alternative to appropria-\ntions.” Id.; see Pub L. No. 101-459 § 209(a), 102 Stat. 2186 (1988).  \n111.  The statute therefore empowers the agency to impose “adjudication fees” by “reg-\nulation[.]” 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m). And as Congress shortly thereafter clarified in a 1990 amendment, \nthose “fees for providing adjudication and naturalization services may be set at a level that will \nensure recovery of the full costs of providing all such services, including the costs of similar \nservices provided without charge to asylum applicants or other immigrants.” Id. (emphasis added); \nsee Pub. L. No. 101-515 § 210(d), 104 Stat. 2101 (1990) (adding this provision).  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 28 of 49\n112.  In other words, the fee for filing an H-1B petition or other request for an immigra-\ntion benefit “may” be set at an amount that allows USCIS to recover its costs for processing H-1B \npetitions and similar services related to programs that cannot generate user fees in their own right. \nBy clear implication, the fee may not be set at a level that bears no relationship whatsoever to those \ncosts and indeed would dwarf them. See, e.g., Heating, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration Distribs. \nInt’l v. EPA, 71 F.4th 59, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (“When draftsmen mention one thing, like a grant \nof authority[,] it necessarily, or at least reasonably, implies the preclusion of alternatives.”) (quo-\ntation marks omitted; alterations incorporated); cf. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 208-209 \n(2007) (statute and federal rule providing that a district court “may” reopen the time for filing a \nnotice of appeal “for a period of 14 days” created a jurisdictional bar on reopenings lasting longer \nthan 14 days). \n113.  The legislative history is in accord. As the conference report on the bill that first \nestablished Section 1356 provided, “[t]he conferees expect that funds generated by this Account \nshall not be used for any purpose other than enhancing naturalization and adjudication programs.” \nH.R. Rep. No. 100-979, at 38 (1988); see also Depts. of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judici-\nary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 1991, Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the \nCommittee on Appropriations, 101st Cong., at 74 (1990) (“The resources to be made available will \nbe used to adjudicate applications and petitions for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality \nAct and to provide necessary support to adjudications and naturalization programs.”). And the \nconference report accompanying the 1990 amendment makes plain that the bolded language above \n(see ¶ 111, supra) clarified that the fees are to be set at a level that allows USCIS to recoup all of \nits costs (as opposed to being strictly tied to the benefit provided to each individual petitioner)—\nnot that the “may” in the clause makes the connection between fee levels and USCIS’s actual costs \nsomehow optional. See H.R. Rep. No. 101-909 (1990) (the provision “allows the Department to \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 29 of 49\nestablish adjudications and naturalization fees at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs \nof the program.”).  \n114.  The government has agreed. Even while resisting the notion that USCIS’s fee re-\nceipts for a given year must precisely match its costs for that year, the government recently affirm-\natively argued that Section 1356(m) “afforded USCIS flexibility to set fees at a level that bears \n‘some relationship’ to its costs such that USCIS can carry out its statutory mandate to recover its \nfull costs. That this flexibility encompasses the possibility that USCIS’s fees collected might, from \ntime to time, exceed its costs spent, makes sense where USCIS must set fees prospectively to \nguarantee future recovery of its yet-to-be-determined full costs.” Reply Mem. of Law in Supp. of \nMot. to Dismiss at 10, Tang v. United States, No. 23-cv-9885 (S.D.N.Y. Oct 3, 2024), Dkt. 65. In \nother words, the government took the position that, although Section 1356(m) permits current fee \nreceipts to exceed current costs “from time to time” in order to make the program administrable, \nthe statute requires fees to at least “bear[] a “‘relationship’ to [USCIS’s] costs” in carrying out its \nstatutory functions. \n115.  Elsewhere, the government has interpreted its authority even less flexibly: DHS \nrecognized in a recent fee rulemaking that “INA section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m) requires \nUSCIS fees to be based on total costs for USCIS to carry out adjudication and naturalization ser-\nvices.” USCIS Fee Schedule and Changes to Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements, 89 \nFed. Reg. 6,194, 6,288 (Jan. 31, 2024); see also id. at 6,287 (stating that a particular fee collected \nunder separate statutory authority “will . . . effectively supersede section 286(m)” by “go[ing] be-\nyond normal cost recovery”). \n116.  In sum, Section 1356(m) provides that fees for benefit applications like H-1B peti-\ntions may be set only at the level necessary for USCIS to adjudicate those applications and perform \nits other functions.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 30 of 49\n117.  Pursuant to that congressional command, until now, H-1B fees have been set by \nUSCIS through notice and comment rulemaking, with close attention paid to justifying the fee \nbased on administrative expenses. See, e.g., U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Sched-\nule and Changes to Certain Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements, 88 Fed. Reg. 402, \n501 (Jan. 4, 2023) (recognizing that an “increase from $10 to $215” in the lottery registration fee \n“may appear to be exorbitant” but arguing that it is necessary to “cover the expenses of the H-1B \nregistration program”).  \n118.  The Proclamation offers no such justification. It baldly conditions H-1B petitions \non a $100,000 payment.  \n119.  Where the most recent H-1B petition fee of $780 was tied to administrative costs \n(see USCIS Fee Schedule, supra, at 39), the new $100,000 figure cannot bear any such relationship \nto costs. Rather, it is a punitively high exaction meant to deter use of the H-1B program.  \n120.  Moreover, Congress explicitly determined that notice-and-comment rulemaking—\nwith the attendant protection for the public via arbitrary-and-capricious review—is requisite to set \nthe appropriate fee. 8 U.S.C. § 1356(m). The President cannot disregard these requirements and \nchange the mechanism by which fees are set, drastically reducing protections for the regulated \npublic.  \n121.  In addition to the baseline requirement under Section 1356(m) that visa fee levels \nmust be tied to the cost of administering visa and related programs, Congress itself has explicitly \nset additional fees for the H-1B program. The imposition of these fees demonstrates that Congress \nknows how to depart from the cost-recovery principle of Section 1356(m) when it wishes to do so.  \n122.  First, Congress has specified that the fee for the H-1B “petition” (either an initial \npetition, a renewal, or a request for an H-1B visa-holder to change employers) “shall be $1,500 for \neach such petition.” 8 U.S.C. §§ 1184(c)(9)(A)-(C); see also id. § 1184(c)(9)(B) (fee is halved for \nsmaller employers).  \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 31 of 49\n123.  Second, Congress has required payment of a $500 “fraud prevention and detection \nfee” from all employers filing an initial H-1B petition or seeking authorization for an H-1B visa-\nholder to change employers. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1184(c)(12)(A), (C); see Pub. L. No. 104-447 § 426, 188 \nStat. 2809, 3357 (2004) (enacting this requirement).  \n124.  Third, Congress has imposed an additional $4,000 fee on certain employers. See \nPub. L. No. 114-113 § 402(g), 129 Stat. 2242, 3006 (2015) (codified at 49 U.S.C. § 10101 note, \nAirline Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, Sec. 411). This additional fee applies \nto employers with more than 50 employees, over half of whom are foreign, nonimmigrant workers. \nId.; see also Pub. L. No. 111-230, § 402(b), 124 Stat. 2485, 2487 (2010) (earlier imposing a smaller \n$2,000 fee on these same employers).  \n125.  And fourth, Congress provided for “premium processing” fees for immigration \nbenefits—currently $2,805 for H-1B applicants—under which sponsoring employers can have pe-\ntitions processed within a shorter timeframe.  8 U.S.C. § 1356(u)(3). The statute specifically limits \nthe circumstances in which premium processing can be suspended. Id. § 1356(u)(5). Congress thus \ndetermined that, if employers are willing to pay extra, they should receive an expedited decision, \ncontrary to the Proclamation’s determination that employers cannot submit a petition at all unless \nthey pay a vastly greater fee. \n126.  In sum, Congress itself has set—and repeatedly adjusted—the appropriate fees for \nH-1B petitions, and the fees set by Congress reflect its policy judgment concerning the design of \nthe H-1B program. Congress structured the fees for visa programs generally to be tied to adminis-\ntrative costs (and to be determined by notice and comment rulemaking), with additional flat fees \n($1,500 and $500) imposed on H-1B petitioners in particular to fund specific initiatives, and an-\nother flat fee ($4,000) on those employers who are most reliant on nonimmigrant workers.  \n127.  The $100,000 fee, imposed with no procedure whatsoever, dramatically upends \nCongress’s deliberate decisions about how much a visa (and in particular, an H-1B visa) should \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 32 of 49\ncost and flouts the cost-recovery principle of Section 1356(m). It also distorts which businesses \ncan afford to participate in the program. Whereas Congress set fees that are attainable by compa-\nnies large and small, the imposition of a $100,000 fee is likely prohibitive to many businesses, \nparticularly small businesses across the country that hire H-1B workers. \n128.  Put differently, the INA permits the executive branch to charge immigration fees in \ntwo circumstances: (a) where the fee is adopted via notice and comment rulemaking and set at a \nlevel necessary to recoup USCIS’s costs (8 U.S.C. § 1356(m)), or (b) where Congress itself has \nexpressly authorized the fee through statute. The Proclamation’s exorbitant $100,000 application \nfee falls into neither category.  \n129.  Because the Proclamation “expressly override[s] particular provisions of the INA” \n(Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 689), it is not a lawful exercise of Section 212(f) power. \nb.  Other INA provisions.  \n130.  The Proclamation also sits uneasily with other specific congressional determina-\ntions regarding the H-1B program.  \n131.  For one, the imposition of a $100,000 fee—which is intended to, and surely will, \nreduce the number of petitions received—will result in significantly fewer H-1B visas. This dra-\nmatic change cannot be squared with Congress’s expectation that the high demand for H-1B visas \nwould warrant imposing a statutory cap on the number of new H-1B visas.  \n132.  Congress decided that employers should be able to sponsor up to 85,000 people—\n65,000 plus up to 20,000 more who must have advanced degrees from American universities—on \nH-1B visas. 8 U.S.C. § 1184(g). Although Congress’s goal in imposing a cap was, in part, to assure \nthat no more than this number of noncitizens could obtain visas under this pathway, its imposition \nof a cap also reflects Congress’s considered policy view of roughly the right number of people to \nbe able to obtain visas through the H-1B program each year. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 33 of 49\n133.  That is, Congress legislated the 85,000-person annual cap against the background \nknowledge that demand for visas under the program vastly exceeded that amount. It was well \naware that by imposing an 85,000-person annual cap, it also was deciding that approximately \n85,000 people would obtain non-cap-exempt H-1B visas annually.  \n134.  Congress arrived at this number by weighing the clear benefits and possible draw-\nbacks of the program. It wanted to ensure that employers were able to bring enough workers into \nthe United States for the Nation to reap the benefits of innovation and economic growth stimulated \nby the H-1B program, while ensuring that the workforce was not overwhelmed by new, highly \nskilled foreign workers. For Congress, 85,000 new visas each year reflected the proper balance. \n135.  For reasons explained above, the Proclamation upsets that balance by surely caus-\ning the number of new H-1B visas to plummet and making the program accessible only to a subset \nof employers. Most companies that rely on H-1B visas will reduce the number of petitions they \nsubmit. Employers who submit few petitions to begin with, or entities like small businesses and \nnonprofits that cannot possibly afford a $100,000 fee, will be unable to participate at all.    \n136.  Moreover, insofar as the Proclamation suggests that the purpose of imposing a \n$100,000 fee is to protect American workers, the use of such a blunt tool to achieve those ends \ncontravenes the intricate labor protections that Congress established and instructed the executive \nto use instead to achieve that goal.  \n137.  Congress has established a carefully reticulated regime to ensure that American \nworkers are not harmed by the H-1B program. The centerpiece of this scheme is the Labor Condi-\ntion Application, which requires any company seeking to hire an H-1B worker to make various \ncertifications to the Department of Labor regarding prevailing labor conditions. See 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1182(n)(1)(A)-(D).  \n138.  Among other requirements, employers must certify that the position pays prevailing \nwages (or higher), that the position will not adversely impact other workers, and that the employer \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 34 of 49\nhas provided certain forms of notice to existing employees in the same occupational classification \nregarding the position. These provisions are designed to ensure that (a) H-1B workers are not hired \nat a rate that undercuts the wages American workers are willing to accept; (b) the creation of an \nH-1B position does not directly result in the elimination of a job held by an American worker; and \n(c) American jobseekers have the ability to compete for and obtain positions that might ultimately \nbe filled by H-1B workers.  \n139.  The executive is not toothless in enforcing these requirements. Employers who vi-\nolate them are subject to monetary fines and bans on filing future H-1B petitions. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(n)(2)(C). And certain employers—including those who have violated the certification re-\nquirement in the past or have a high percentage of H-1B workers already—must specifically certify \nthat they tried and failed to fill the position with an American worker and that the employer has \nnot and will not displace any American worker within 180 days before or after the date of the \napplication. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(n)(1)(E), (n)(1)(G), (n)(3)(A).  \n140.  The predominant concern expressed in the Proclamation is that certain employers \nare abusing the H-1B system to undercut American workers. That is, no doubt, a serious issue, \nwhich is why Congress carefully considered that problem and equipped the executive with various \nmeasures both to prevent such abuse from occurring—such as the labor condition application pro-\ncess—and to penalize employers who do abuse the system.  \n141.  In other words, when Congress created the H-1B program—and in its continued \nmaintenance of and modifications to that program—it was aware of the potential for abuse and \nauthorized the executive to take certain measures to prevent and remediate abuse. What Congress \ndid not authorize is disincentivizing the use of the program by imposing a fee many times the \namount of fees set by Congress. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 35 of 49\nc.  Practical availability of the H-1B program. \n142.  At bottom, the Proclamation and its practical impact are difficult to square with \nCongress’s basic determination that domestic employers should be able to access a program for \nadmitting highly skilled nonimmigrant workers from specialized fields.  \n143.  Indeed, calling what the Proclamation institutes a “payment” is something of a mis-\nnomer. Contrary to the Proclamation’s preamble, instituting a new $100,000 price tag on H-1B \npetitions does not merely impose “higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program \nwhile still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.” Rather, \nthe fee renders the H-1B program practically unavailable for many companies, particularly small \nbusinesses, depriving them of a talent pipeline that is critical to innovation and productivity. \n144.  Although the Proclamation suggests that employers still may hire “the best of the \nbest,” it fails to appreciate the economic reality that many employers, particularly small businesses, \nsimply cannot pay the $100,000 fee, regardless of how talented a prospective employee may be. \nFor example, innovative startups typically compensate even their highest performing employees \nlargely with equity compensation rather than cash precisely because cash is scarce, making a \n$100,000 per-hire outlay impracticable. The filter imposed by the new fee is therefore less about \nthe quality and promise of the prospective employee, and more about the financial circumstances \nof the employer. \n145.  Moreover, even to the extent the Proclamation could be successful in admitting \nonly “the best of the best,” it distorts Congress’s design for the H-1B program. There are already \nseparate provisions in the INA enabling companies to sponsor visas for prospective employees \nwith “exceptional ability,” “extraordinary ability,” or other comparable qualities, and those noncit-\nizens are eligible for immigrant visas. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1153(b)(1)(A), (b)(2)(A). The H-1B program \nis different. By congressional design, employers need not show that their prospective workers are \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 36 of 49\nthe best of the best, but merely highly skilled. The statutory tradeoff is that workers on H-1B status \nare only eligible for a temporary stay in this country.  \n146.  Thus, even assuming that employers willing and able to pay a $100,000 fee corre-\nlated precisely with the “best of the best” talent, the imposition of such a “best of the best” require-\nment on the H-1B program would trample Congress’s duly enacted policy choices. \n147.  Although the President has broad authority to ensure that those entering the United \nStates under the H-1B program align with the national interest, the President cannot nullify the \nprogram altogether by making it infeasible for a subset of employers to use, nor fundamentally \namend the program Congress crafted. So long as the Proclamation is in effect, that is the result. \n2.  The Proclamation exceeds the President’s authority by misapplying or failing to fulfill \nstatutory requirements. \n148.  The Proclamation also exceeds the scope of the President’s statutory authority in \nseveral other respects. \na.  The $100,000 payment is not an entry restriction.  \n149.  First, the Proclamation relies on a statute that permits the President to “suspend” or \n“restrict[]” “entry” (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)), but the Proclamation relates to entry only tangentially. \nCf. Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 694-695 & n.4 (discussing “the basic distinction” between “the concepts \nof entry and admission,” on the one hand, and “issuance of a visa,” on the other). A true entry \nsuspension, such as the proclamation at issue in Hawaii, flatly bars the entry of all nationals from \ncertain countries or restricts the entry of other countries’ citizens to certain statuses or certain clas-\nses. See id. at 679-680. Here, by contrast, the Proclamation seeks to change the terms of an existing \nvisa program under the INA while continuing to admit the very same noncitizens, so long as they \ncomply with the new terms.  \n150.  That is a “restriction” on “entry” (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)) only in the most superficial \nsense. Taken to its extreme, the same logic would permit the President to promulgate an entirely \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 37 of 49\nnew shadow-INA—that is, an entirely new extra-statutory system setting the terms and conditions \nof immigration to the United States—giving the President blanket authority to create completely \ndifferent classifications, rules, and procedures, and deny “entry” to any noncitizen who did not \ncomply with them. Section 212(f)’s delegation of entry-suspension power to the President should \nnot be read so broadly, for a whole host of reasons: It would find the proverbial elephant in a \ntextual mousehole, given the lack of any text naturally read as empowering the President to create \nnew immigration programs (see Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001)); it \nruns afoul of the major questions doctrine for similar reasons (see W. Va. v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n723 (2022) (Congress does not “typically use oblique or elliptical language to empower an agency \nto make a radical or fundamental change to a statutory scheme”) (quotation marks omitted)); and \nit raises serious constitutional questions about Congress’s ability to empower the President to dis-\nregard or override “duly enacted statutes” (Clinton, 524 U.S. at 447; see, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 \nU.S. 289, 299-300 (2001) (“[I]f an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise seri-\nous constitutional problems, and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is ‘fairly possi-\nble,’ we are obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problems.”) (citation omitted)).  \n151.  Instead, the text is best read as permitting the President to either “suspend the entry” \nof a “class of aliens” or to “impose on the entry of aliens” a “restriction[]” (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) \n(emphasis added)) in the natural, negative sense of that word. See, e.g., Restrict, Webster’s New \nInternational Dictionary 2125 (2d ed. 1947) (“To restrain within bounds; to limit; to confine.”); \nRestrict, Oxford English Dictionary (Rev. 2010) (“To limit (a person or thing); to confine to or \nwithin certain limits. . . . To prohibit or prevent from.”). It does not empower the executive to \ncondition a noncitizen’s entry on the noncitizen’s compliance with affirmative, non-statutory man-\ndates. By doing so, the Proclamation exceeds the power conferred by Section 212(f). \n152.  Elsewhere in the statute, by contrast, Congress expressly used the language of “con-\nditions,” not restrictions, when that is what it meant to authorize. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1184(a)(1) \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 38 of 49\n(“The admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and \nunder such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, including when he \ndeems necessary the giving of a bond.”) (emphases added); Pub. L. 82-414, § 214, 66 Stat. 163, \n189 (enacting this language, like Section 212(f), in the original 1952 INA). That language, unlike \n“restrictions” in Section 212(f), naturally does encompass requiring affirmative action from a \nnoncitizen in order to enter. See Condition, Webster’s New International Dictionary 557 (2d ed. \n1947) (“Something established or agreed upon as a requisite to the doing or taking effect of some-\nthing else.”). “That Congress used different language in these two provisions strongly suggests \nthat it meant for them to work differently.” Stanley v. City of Sanford, 145 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2025). \nIf “Congress had wanted” to authorize the President to impose conditions, rather than restrictions, \n“it knew exactly how to do so—it could have simply borrowed from the statute next door.” SAS \nInst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 364 (2018).  \n153.  Additionally, whatever authority Section 212(f) may confer, it certainly does not \nauthorize the President to institute new payments as conditions of entry. After all, because raising \nrevenue is a core power reserved for Congress (see, e.g., U.S. Const. art. I § 7, cl. 1; id. § 8, cl. 1), \n“Congress must indicate clearly its intention to delegate to the Executive the discretionary author-\nity to” impose “‘fees’ or ‘taxes’” (Skinner v. Mid-Am. Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 224 (1989) \n(quoting Fed. Energy Admin. v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 559 n.10 (1976))); see also \nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 631 (“The President has no power to raise revenues. That power is in the \nCongress by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.”).  \n154.  Section 212(f) contains no such “clear[]” “indicat[ion].” Skinner, 490 U.S. at 224. \nYet, as discussed, elsewhere in the INA, Congress has been clear in enumerating certain specific \nH-1B fees, and it has provided a limited, well-defined “delegat[ion]” (id.) of fee-setting power \nunder Section 1356(m) for USCIS to recover its costs. Courts have not hesitated to block executive \naction that strains the text of Section 212(f) in similar ways. See, e.g., Refugee & Immigrant Ctr., \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 39 of 49\n2025 WL 1825431, at *4 (rejecting the use of Section 212(f) to create a non-statutory repatriation \nsystem), stay denied in part and granted in part by No. 25-5243 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 1, 2025); Presi-\ndent and Fellows of Harvard College v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2025 WL 1737493, at *1, \n*9-10 (D. Mass. June 23, 2025) (rejecting use of Section 212(f) to bar noncitizens from entering \nthe country to study at a particular institution).  \n155.  Moreover, certain of the Proclamation’s provisions go beyond any possible con-\nception of an entry restriction. Section 1(b) of the Proclamation orders the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to “restrict decisions on petitions not accompanied by a $100,000 payment.” Though in \nsome sense related, the concept of “entry” is separate from the H-1B petitioning and “visa issu-\nance” process. Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 694-695 & n.3. Section 212(f) does not provide authority to \ncategorically deem certain petitions acceptable or unacceptable. Cf. Refugee & Immigrant Ctr., \n2025 WL 1825431, at *32, 33 (“[T]he authority to ‘impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions \nhe may deem to be appropriate’ does not mean that the President has the authority to alter the rules \nthat apply to those who have already entered,” and “statutory grants of authority to the executive \nbranch do not carry with them a sweeping, implied authority analogous to Congress’s power under \nthe Necessary and Proper Clause.”) (citation omitted) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)). \n156.  Likewise, Section 2(b) of the Proclamation orders the Secretary of State to “approve \nonly those visa petitions for which the filing employer has made the [$100,000] payment.” Again, \nthe President has broad authority concerning entry into the United States but does not have author-\nity to singlehandedly direct the issuance or non-issuance of visas created by statute. Hawaii, 585 \nU.S. at 694-695 & n.3; Refugee & Immigrant Ctr., 2025 WL 1825431, at *32. Indeed, as courts in \nthis district have held, the State Department has a nondiscretionary duty to process visa applica-\ntions presented to it, even if the visa applicant is currently barred from entry by a Section 212(f) \nproclamation. See Filazapovich v. Department of State, 60 F. Supp. 3d 203, 235 (D.D.C. 2021) \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 40 of 49\n(rejecting the argument that a Proclamation banning an immigrant from entry renders her ineligible \nfor a visa,”) rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Goodluck v. Biden, 104 F.4th 920 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \n157.  Sections 1(b) and 2(b), in directing federal agencies to take actions that lie outside \nthe President’s purview under Section 212(f), are therefore plainly beyond the power conferred by \nthe statute. \nb.  The Proclamation lacks the statutorily required finding necessary to pro-\nclaim a restriction on entry.  \n158.  As a prerequisite to instituting any restriction on entry, the INA requires that the \nPresident “find[] that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would \nbe detrimental to the interests of the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). But, while the Proclama-\ntion purports to follow this “find[ing]” requirement, the findings within the Proclamation are seri-\nously deficient.  \n159.  For one thing, much of the data underlying the preamble’s conclusions is mislead-\ning. For instance, the preamble cites a supposed “36 percent discount for H-1B ‘entry-level’ posi-\ntions as compared to full-time, traditional workers.” But that figure pits the prevailing wage of \nentry-level H-1B workers—that is, workers with specialized skills primarily due to their academic \ntraining, yet with few years of professional experience—against the median wage for all workers \nin the pertinent industry and region. It is entirely unsurprising that entry-level workers—who by \ndefinition lack experience and skills gained on the job—would command a lower wage than the \nmedian of all employees in the relevant industry, quite apart from their immigration status.  \n160.  Likewise, the Proclamation references an unnamed “2017 study” showing that \n“wages for American computer scientists would have been 2.6 percent to 5.1 percent higher and \nemployment in computer science for American workers would have been 6.1 percent to 10.8 per-\ncent higher in 2001.” The Proclamation notably does not cite the actual study. It is clear why: \nnotwithstanding that specific finding, the study broadly concludes that “immigration increased the \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 41 of 49\noverall welfare of US natives.” See Bound et al., Understanding the Economic Impact of the H-1B \nProgram  on  the  U.S.,  National  Bureau  of  Economic  Research  Working  Paper  23153, \nhttps://perma.cc/N9KF-XH3Y.  \n161.  Additionally, the Proclamation makes no finding about the putative “class of al-\niens” (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)) that is ultimately the subject of the restriction implemented. See Hawaii, \n585 U.S. at 687-688 (acknowledging that “properly identify[ing] a ‘class of aliens’” is a “textual \nlimit[]” imposed by Section 212(f)). \n162.  The class of noncitizens identified in the Proclamation whose entry would be det-\nrimental to the United States is noncitizens “whose petitions are [not] accompanied or supple-\nmented by a payment of $100,000.” For one thing, this curious grouping strains the statutory term \n“class” beyond recognition. See, e.g., Class, Black’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) (“A group of \npeople . . . that have common characteristics or attributes.”); cf. Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 688 (holding \nthat “the word ‘class’ comfortably encompasses a group of people linked by nationality”).  \n163.  Indeed, historically speaking, this grouping includes all H-1B applicants. Going \nforward their petitions will either include a $100,000 fee or exclude it, but the presence or absence \nof that fee will have nothing to do with the noncitizens themselves. It will not, for example, bear \nany relationship to their respective qualifications for employment in the United States, the eco-\nnomic value they might generate by working in the United States, the implications on national \nsecurity or foreign policy of their entry into the United States, the industry in which they work, \nand so on.  \n164.  In fact, the presence or absence of the $100,000 payment will have nothing to do \nwith the noncitizen at all, since it will be the employer filing the petition who either agrees or \nrefuses to include a $100,000 payment.  \n165.  In any event, the Proclamation makes no findings about any noncitizens, let alone \nthe specific class of noncitizens whose petitions are not accompanied or supplemented by a \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 42 of 49\npayment of $100,000. The preamble is directed entirely at employers who purportedly abuse the \nH-1B system, particularly in the IT field, and the concomitant impact on workers in that industry \nfrom that alleged abuse. It says nothing at all about the noncitizens actually targeted by the re-\nstriction nor why noncitizens whose H-1B petitions include a $100,000 payment are any less det-\nrimental to workers than noncitizens whose petitions do not.  \n166.  There is, by the same token, no connection between the findings made in the Proc-\nlamation, the class of noncitizens identified for exclusion, and the specific restriction adopted. For \ninstance, the Proclamation draws no connections between the broad trends it identifies—a rising \nproportion of foreign-born workers in the IT industry and rising unemployment for Americans \ngraduating with degrees in that field—and the existence of a class of noncitizens whose H-1B visas \nlack a $100,000 fee.  \n167.  The Proclamation does not include any findings that noncitizens within the class \nare less likely to be hired by companies in the IT industry or by employers who abuse the H-1B \nsystem. There is also no connection drawn between the imposition of a $100,000 fee and the cur-\ntailing of H-1B abuse. Nor is there any mention of why the existing statutory tools for preventing \nand penalizing abuse are inadequate to accomplish that goal.  \n168.  In all, the Proclamation exceeds the President’s statutory authority. It directly con-\nflicts with the INA multiple times over, it extends to areas beyond the scope of the President’s \nauthority to restrict entry, and it fails to make the threshold findings required by law.  \n169.  As an act exceeding the President’s lawful authority, the Proclamation must be de-\nclared unlawful and its enforcement must be enjoined as to the U.S. Chamber and its members. \nSee Reich, 74 F.3d at 1328 (“[R]eview of the legality of Presidential action can ordinarily be ob-\ntained in a suit seeking to enjoin the officers who attempt to enforce the President’s directive.”) \n(quotation marks omitted). \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 43 of 49\nB.  Agency action implementing the Proclamation must be declared unlawful and set \naside under the APA. \n170.  For many of the reasons described above, implementation of the Proclamation by \nany agency of the United States will also violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  \n171.  The APA requires a court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right,” or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n172.  Agency action taken to implement a presidential proclamation or executive order \nis subject to review under the APA. See Chamber of Com. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1327 (D.C. Cir. \n1996) (agency action based on an executive order is not “insulate[d]” from “judicial review under \nthe APA, even if the validity of the [executive order] [is] thereby drawn into question”).  \n173.  Many aspects of the Proclamation are not self-executing but, rather, require imple-\nmentation by executive branch agencies. For example, Section 1(b) of the Proclamation expressly \ndirects the Secretary of Homeland Security to “restrict decisions on petitions not accompanied by \na $100,000 payment,” but Section 1(c) authorizes the Secretary to waive that requirement, for a \nsingle noncitizen or a class, on grounds of “the national interest.” Likewise, Section 2(b) directs \nthe Secretary of State to “approve only those visa petitions for which the filing employer has made \nthe [$100,000] payment.”  \n174.  In accordance with these commands, immediately after the Proclamation, USCIS \nissued a memorandum, Proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers, H-\n1B, which states that, effective September 21, 2025, “[t]he entry into the United States of aliens as \nnonimmigrants to perform services in a specialty occupation” under the H-1B program “is re-\nstricted, except for those aliens whose petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment \nof $100,000.” The memorandum further provides that it “applies to H-1B employment-based \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 44 of 49\npetitions filed after” the effective date. The document also directs “[a]ll officers of United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services” to “ensure that their decisions are consistent with this guid-\nance.” Id. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued a memorandum to similar effect. And \nthe Department of State “has posted guidance to all consulate offices, consistent with” the other \nagencies’ memoranda.5 \n175.  As fully described above, agency actions taken to implement the Proclamation are \nsubstantively invalid and must be set aside under the APA, for numerous reasons.  \n176.  First, the $100,000 payment called for in the Proclamation was not set by notice-\nand-comment rulemaking, but by presidential fiat—violating both Section 1356(m)’s express re-\nquirement of such rulemaking and the fundamental rule that existing notice-and-comment regula-\ntions (such as DHS’s existing fee schedule, see 8 C.F.R. §§ 106.1(a), 106.2) may be amended or \nrescinded only through additional notice-and-comment rulemaking. See, e.g., Friends of Animals \nv. Bernhardt, 961 F.3d 1197, 1205 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (“It is, of course, black-letter administrative \nlaw that ordinarily an agency that promulgates a rule [using notice and comment] must use the \nsame procedure to revoke that rule.”). Indeed, the government previously has taken the position \nthat “[a]fter the fee schedule is effective, fees cannot be adjusted until the next fee schedule notice-\nand-comment rulemaking.” USCIS Fee Schedule, 88 Fed. Reg. at 447.  Notice-and-comment rule-\nmaking both “helps to prevent mistakes” and “also helps ensure that regulated parties receive fair \ntreatment, a value basic to American administrative law.” Ivy Sports Med., LLC v. Burwell, 767 \n \n5   The informality of these documents does not detract from their finality. See, e.g., Nat’l Ev’tl \nDev. Ass’n’s Clean Air Project v. EPA, 752 F.3d 999, 1006-1007 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (document was \nfinal agency action where it “provides firm guidance to enforcement officials about how to handle \npermitting decisions”); Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2000) \n(same, where purported guidance document “reads like a ukase. It commands, it requires, it orders, \nit dictates.”). \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 45 of 49\nF.3d 81, 87-88 (D.C. Cir. 2014). The failure to follow that process here was both unlawful and \narbitrary and capricious.  \n177.  Second, agency action implementing the Proclamation will not be done pursuant to \na valid exercise of the President’s authority to exclude noncitizens from the United States under \nSection 212(f). Specifically, Section 212(f) is limited to restrictions on entry and does not authorize \nthe President, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary of State to direct approvals or \ndisapprovals of H-1B petitions or H-1B visas.  Despite instructions in the Proclamation to restrict \ndecisions on petitions and the issuance of visas to applicants who have paid the $100,000 fee, the \nPresident has no statutory authority under Section 212(f) to direct USCIS’s action on any H-1B \npetition or the State Department’s issuance of visas. These subjects are not committed to the Pres-\nident’s discretion by law. Rather, the President’s authority under Section 212 is limited to entry \ninto the United States by a noncitizen or class of noncitizens. Refugee & Immigrant Ctr., 2025 WL \n1825431, at *32-33. And in any event, the President’s restriction-of-entry authority depends on \nthe President making findings that he has not made.  \n178.  Third, such actions directly conflict with other elements of the INA, supplanting \ncarefully considered congressional judgments regarding the H-1B program. Specifically, imposing \na $100,000 fee on H-1B petitions will conflict with other provisions in the law relating to the \nappropriate fees for the H-1B program; Congress’s decision to make the program available to a \nwide cross-section of employers; and the law’s carefully reticulated scheme of labor protections.  \n179.  Finally, such actions are, and will be, arbitrary and capricious. The imposition of a \n$100,000 fee on H-1B petitions has nothing to do with the stated goals of that action, as expressed \nin the Proclamation, and the Proclamation rests on arguments and data referred to in the preamble \nthat are conclusory, directly contradicted by the underlying sources quoted, and fail to consider all \naspects of the problem, among other fundamental procedural defects. \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 46 of 49\n180.  Because agency action implementing the Proclamation will be done in violation of \nthe APA, the court must set aside any such action and declare it unlawful.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nTHE PROCLAMATION AND ANY IMPLEMENTING ACTION UNDER IT ARE IN \nEXCESS OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH AUTHORITY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION \nAND LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES  \n181.  The U.S. Chamber incorporates and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as though \nfully set forth herein. \n182.  Federal courts possess inherent authority to enjoin executive action that is in excess \nof lawful authority.  \n183.  For the reasons set forth in the foregoing paragraphs, the Proclamation is in excess \nof the President’s authority under Sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, and any executive action \nimplementing it is therefore in excess of executive branch authority under the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States.  \n184.  Specifically, among other things, the imposition of a $100,000 fee for H-1B peti-\ntions directly contravenes Congress’s statutory enactments related to the H-1B visa programs. \nThese enactments include the much lower fees that Congress deemed appropriate—largely related \nto the direct costs USCIS incurs in reviewing H-1B petitions and providing similar services. The \nenactments also include the statutory cap on the number of visas that may be issued under the H-\n1B program each year and the labor protections incorporated into the law.  \n185.  Moreover, the imposition of a $100,000 fee for H-1B petitions will fundamentally \nalter the program, diminishing a program that Congress has said should exist, and should provide \na pathway for employers to bring highly skilled noncitizens to work in the United States.  \n186.  The Proclamation also exceeds the President’s authority under Section 212(f) by \ndirecting agency action that is beyond the scope of the President’s authority to restrict entry into \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 47 of 49\nthe United States; is not rationally related to a “class” of noncitizens targeted for restriction on \nentry; and does not contain “find[ings]” pertaining to that class of noncitizens required by law.  \n187.  Accordingly, the Proclamation and any implementing actions under it (including \nany not subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act) are ultra vires executive action, \nfor which there is no adequate remedy other than an injunction pursuant to this Court’s inherent \nequitable power. The implementation of the Proclamation must be enjoined. \nCOUNT II \nTHE PROCLAMATION’S IMPLEMENTATION VIOLATES  \nTHE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2) \n188.  The U.S. Chamber incorporates and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as though \nfull set forth herein.  \n189.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right,” or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n190.  Final agency action implementing the Proclamation is subject to review under the \nAPA. See Chamber of Commerce, 74 F.3d at 1327. \n191.  The Proclamation is not entirely self-executing but requires independent implemen-\ntation by agencies and authorizes agencies to make independent judgments. Indeed, it expressly \ndirects agency action.  \n192.  As fully described in the foregoing paragraphs, agency action implementing the \nProclamation is, and will be, contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.  \n193.  Specifically, among other things, agency action implementing the Proclamation \nwould impose an unlawful $100,000 fee for H-1B petitions, in direct contravention of Congress’s \nstatutory enactments related to the H-1B visa program, including the fees set by law, the statutory \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 48 of 49\ncap on H-1B visas, and the labor protections existing in the law, all of which reflect careful con-\ngressional balancing aimed to implement a robust and active H-1B program while protecting \nAmerican workers.  \n194.  Agency action taken to implement the Proclamation also would be unlawful be-\ncause it would be taken pursuant to directions from the President made in excess of his lawful \nauthority under Section 212(f).  \n195.  Action implementing the Proclamation also would be procedurally arbitrary and \ncapricious, as the imposition of a fee on H-1B petitions by the executive branch must be done via \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking.  \n196.  Additionally, such action would be unlawful and arbitrary and capricious because \nthere are no “find[ings]” related to the targeted class of noncitizens, as required under Section \n212(f), and the Proclamation rests on arguments and data citations that are conclusory, manifestly \ninaccurate, and fail to consider important aspects of the problem.  \n197.  Because agency action implementing the Proclamation violates the APA, it must \nbe vacated and set aside. \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03675     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 49 of 49\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment in its favor \nand that the Court: \n1.
