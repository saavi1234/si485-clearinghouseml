INTRODUCTION \n2  1.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has \n3  unilaterally and illegally terminated a multi-billion-dollar program designed to bring low-\n4  cost distributed solar energy to over 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged \n5  communities. \n6  2.  The Plaintiffs (“States”) bring this action to challenge EPA’s abrupt \n7  termination of this program, known as “Solar for All” (“SFA” or “SFA Program”). In 2022, \n8  Congress amended the Clean Air Act to establish a program called the “Greenhouse Gas \n9  Reduction Fund.” Public Law 117-169, Sec. 60103, 136 Stat. 2065-66 (formerly codified at \n10  42 U.S.C. § 7434 (2024), hereinafter “Clean Air Act Section 134”). Congress directed EPA \n11  to make competitive grants to states, local governments, Tribes, and non-profits “to enable \n12  low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission \n13  technologies, including distributed technologies on residential rooftops, and to carry out \n14  other greenhouse gas emission reduction activities.” Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(1). \n15  Congress appropriated $7 billion to fund these grants, and directed that the funding be \n16  obligated by September 30, 2024.  \n17  3.  On April 22, 2024, after a rigorous application process, EPA announced it \n18  had selected sixty qualified recipients (“SFA Recipients”) and awarded the $7 billion \n19  appropriated by Congress to carry out the SFA Program. Plaintiffs were SFA Recipients \n20  selected to partner with EPA and carry out Congress’s mandate.  \n21  4.  By August 16, 2024, EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion appropriated for \n22  the SFA Program, in accordance with Congress’s statutory requirement.  \n23  5.  Plaintiffs executed Assistance Agreements with EPA and received their \n24  awards in their Automated Standard Application for Payments (“ASAP”) accounts. \n25  Plaintiffs got to work building out their state SFA programs and doing their part to fulfill \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 3 of 39\n \n1  Congress’s mandate to make solar energy accessible to all, including low-income and other \n2  disadvantaged communities.  \n3  6.  On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” \n4  or H.R. 1, into law. In H.R. 1, Congress repealed Section 134 of the Clean Air Act. In H.R. \n5  1, Congress expressly rescinded only “the unobligated balances of amounts made available \n6  to carry out [Section 134] (as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act).”  \n7  Pub. L. 119-21, § 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 154 (2025) (emphasis added).  \n8  7.  Congress did not, however, rescind any funds that had been obligated by “the \n9  day before the date of enactment” of H.R. 1, which is July 3, 2025. All of the funds awarded \n10  to Plaintiffs were obligated by August 16, 2024, long before H.R. 1’s enactment. Thus, H.R. \n11  1 did not affect Plaintiffs’ obligated funds, nor did it affect the continuation of EPA’s \n12  administration of the state SFA programs already funded and underway. \n13  8.  Upon information and belief, on or before August 7, 2025, Defendants \n14  erroneously interpreted H.R. 1 to eliminate the statutory basis for the SFA Program (“H.R. 1 \n15  Interpretation”) and, based on that interpretation, decided to terminate the entire SFA \n16  Program (“Program Termination Directive”). On August 7, 2025, for the first time, EPA \n17  Administrator Lee Zeldin publicly announced on X and on EPA’s YouTube channel that \n18  “we are ending Solar for All for good!”  \n19  9.  That same day, EPA issued a substantively identical termination \n20  memorandum to each SFA Recipient (“Termination Memorandum”), including Plaintiffs, \n21  explaining that it “has made the decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants \n22  because EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering \n23  and overseeing the program.” See, e.g., Memorandum from Devon Brown, EPA Official, to \n24  Amy Wheeless, Federal Policy and Program Alignment Manager, Washington State \n25  Department of Commerce (Aug. 7, 2028), a true and accurate copy of which is attached \n26  hereto as Exhibit A. \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 4 of 39\n \n1  10.  Upon information and belief, on or after August 7, 2025, EPA also directed \n2  staff to immediately commence deobligation of all remaining SFA funds (“Deobligation \n3  Directive”). Within one week of the Program Termination Directive, Defendants illegally \n4  and arbitrarily liquidated and removed from Plaintiffs’ ASAP accounts approximately 90% \n5  of the funds that were obligated to Plaintiffs before August 16, 2024, despite the fact that \n6  H.R. 1 explicitly limited rescission to funds that were unobligated as of July 3, 2025. \n7  11.  As set forth below, EPA’s H.R. 1 Interpretation is contrary to H.R. 1’s plain \n8  meaning, and the Program Termination Directive was therefore unlawful, arbitrary and \n9  capricious, in excess of Defendants’ statutory authority, and in violation of the \n10  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). And because the Executive \n11  Branch has no authority to unilaterally terminate a program that Congress has funded, \n12  Defendants’ actions are also unconstitutional.  \n13  12.  Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed by Defendants’ executive \n14  overreach. By arbitrarily terminating a program in which Plaintiffs participated and which \n15  was expected to bring substantial benefits to Plaintiffs and their residents, Defendants have \n16  illegally eliminated Plaintiffs’ ability to participate in and benefit from the SFA Program.  \n17  13.  Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court: 1) declare that the H.R. 1 \n18  Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and the Deobligation Directive are \n19  unlawful and should be vacated; 2) grant injunctive relief prohibiting EPA from \n20  implementing the H.R. 1 Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and Deobligation \n21  Directive; and 3) order EPA to reinstate the SFA Program and perform the necessary \n22  administrative support to the Program and SFA Recipients. \n23  / / / \n24  / / / \n25  / / / \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 5 of 39\n \n1  II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n21  I.  Congress Establishes the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \n22  42.  On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into \n23  law. Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818.  \n24  43.  One key provision of the Act was the $27 billion “Greenhouse Gas \n25  Reduction Fund,” which Congress added as Section 134 of the Clean Air Act. Public Law \n26  117-169, Sec. 60103, 136 Stat. 2065-66. Congress established the Greenhouse Gas \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 9 of 39\n \n1  Reduction Fund “to mobilize financing and private capital to address the climate crisis, \n2  ensure our country’s economic competitiveness, and promote energy independence while \n3  delivering lower energy costs and economic revitalization to communities that have \n4  historically been left behind.”1  \n5  44.  Congress did not simply create a $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction \n6  Fund for EPA to administer without restriction. Instead, Congress made four individual \n7  appropriations to EPA and gave EPA specific instructions about how to administer those \n8  funds. \n9  45.  One of those individual appropriations was a $7 billion appropriation for \n10  “zero-emission technologies,” which funded the SFA Program. More specifically, Congress \n11  directed EPA to operate the program by making competitive grants to “eligible \n12  recipients”—including states—“for the purposes of providing grants, loans, or other forms \n13  of financial assistance, as well as technical assistance, to enable low-income and \n14  disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies, including \n15  distributed technologies on residential rooftops, and to carry out other greenhouse gas \n16  emission reduction activities[.]” Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(1).  \n17  46.  Congress also appropriated to EPA $30 million for the “administrative costs \n18  necessary to carry out activities under [Section 134].” Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(4). This \n19  $30 million appropriation was “[i]n addition to amounts otherwise available.” Id.  \n20  47.  The SFA appropriation was a time-limited, multi-year appropriation \n21  beginning in fiscal year 2022 and expiring on September 30, 2024, meaning EPA had just \n22  over two years to design and build the SFA Program and to award the funds that Congress \n23  had appropriated. Congress further directed that EPA begin its grantmaking “not later than” \n24  February 13, 2023. See, e.g., Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(1). \n25 \n \n1 U.S. Env’t Prot.

EPA Creates and Implements the SFA Program \n2  48.  Beginning in October 2022, EPA undertook a months-long public \n3  stakeholder engagement process to inform its implementation of the Greenhouse Gas \n4  Reduction Fund appropriations, including how to design the competitive grant programs that \n5  Congress directed EPA to create.2   \n6  49.  In April 2023, EPA announced a final framework for the three grant \n7  competitions EPA would administer under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including \n8  the $7 billion SFA Program. This framework included details such as “preliminary \n9  descriptions of key parameters, application requirements, and anticipated reporting \n10  obligations.”3 \n11  50.  On June 28, 2023, EPA published its initial Notice of Funding Opportunity, \n12  or “NOFO,” outlining the SFA grant application requirements. EPA explained in the NOFO \n13  that it had designed the SFA Program to encourage the deployment of “residential \n14  distributed solar energy to lower energy bills for millions of Americans” and to “catalyze \n15  transformation in markets serving low-income and disadvantaged communities.”4  \n16  51.  The SFA grant application period closed in October 2023, and EPA \n17  commenced a rigorous, six-month application review process. According to EPA, “[o]ver \n18  200 federal experts in climate, power markets, affordable housing, state energy policy, \n19  Tribal energy, labor, and consumer protection from across the interagency participated in \n20  the [SFA] review and selection process.”5 In all, SFA applicants underwent at least three \n21   \n2 Richard K.

Between April 22 and August 16, 2024, EPA worked with each of the \n7  selected applicants to finalize how each SFA Recipient would operate its SFA program, \n8  which was memorialized in a signed Assistance Agreement. EPA contemplated that the \n9  SFA Recipients would “expand[] existing solar programs for low-income and disadvantaged \n10  communities and launch[] new ones, which will collectively deliver residential solar to over \n11  900,000 low-income households nationwide.”7  \n12  54.  By August 16, 2024, EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion appropriated \n13  under Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(1) (“SFA Funds”) and entered into grant agreements \n14  with Plaintiffs.  \n15  55.  EPA designed the SFA Program to provide programmatic support to SFA \n16  Recipients. That support included EPA and SFA Recipients working hand-in-hand in the \n17  initial months of the program to finalize program workplans and budgets before beginning \n18  to implement their programs and funding projects in early 2025.8 Other aspects included \n19  reporting, procuring services and tools that support recipients in program design, and \n20  establishing and convening advisory councils. \n21  56.  Relying on Congress’s authorization of the Solar for All program, and EPA’s \n22  creation and implementation of the Solar for All program beginning in October 2022, the \n23 \n \n6 U.S. Env’t. Prot. Agency, Biden-Harris Administration Announces $7 Billion Solar for All Grants to \n24 \nDeliver Residential Solar, Saving Low-Income Americans $350 Million Annually and Advancing Environmental \nJustice Across America (Apr. 22, 2024), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-\n25 \nannounces-7-billion-solar-all-grants-deliver-residential.  \n7 Id. \n26 \n8 Id. \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   11  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 12 of 39\n \n1  SFA Recipients, including Plaintiffs, negotiated work plans and proposed budgets with \n2  EPA. The work plan process included identifying program areas for funding, detailing how \n3  funds would be allocated, and outlining terms and conditions. Until the work plans were \n4  approved, Plaintiffs could only access up to two percent of their total obligated funds. \n5  57.  On or about December 2024, the SFA Recipients finalized their work plans \n6  with EPA’s approval and EPA lifted the two percent funding restriction, allowing the SFA \n7  Recipients to proceed with implementation of their work plans with the benefit of all their \n8  obligated funds. \n9  58.  Some States opted to take advantage of a “Program Planning Period” or \n10  “Year”, during which they could continue developing and refining their state SFA programs \n11  with EPA’s support and guidance. States were able to collaborate with their colleagues at \n12  EPA to develop plans that would best serve their individual populations, while also \n13  achieving the overarching goals of the SFA Program: to “enable low-income and \n14  disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies.” Clean \n15  Air Act Section 134(a)(1).  \n16  59.  The States that opted for a Program Planning Period took concrete steps to \n17  develop their programming during this time. For example, in Washington, staff at the \n18  Washington State Department of Commerce spent more than 5,000 employee hours \n19  developing state SFA programming, meeting with community members and stakeholders, \n20  and negotiating and entering into agreements with contractors and subcontractors to \n21  implement Washington’s SFA programming. Likewise, in Arizona, the Governor’s Office \n22  of Resiliency consulted with local governments and utility companies to develop its \n23  application and Work Plan. Many States, including Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, \n24  Minnesota, and California, used the Program Planning Period to collaborate with tribal \n25  governments to ensure that SFA programs would benefit those communities, too.  \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 13 of 39\n \n1  60.  Other States were able to implement their SFA programs immediately, \n2  without taking a full Program Planning Period. For example:  \n3  a.  Michigan received EPA approval to exit the Program Planning Period \n4  in early February 2025 and released a pilot funding opportunity soon \n5  thereafter, selecting thirteen pilot awardees by August 2025; \n6  b.  Illinois exited its planning period in January 2025 and, with EPA’s \n7  approval, promptly withdrew $11 million in funds to expand Illinois’s \n8  existing Community Solar Program and issued NOFOs for residential \n9  solar and community solar sub-grant programs; and \n10  c.  Following EPA’s approval to exit the planning period and commence \n11  program implementation, Massachusetts hired or reallocated 14.5 \n12  full-time employees to implement the program; secured $8,300,000 in \n13  complementary state funding to support program administration \n14  costs; negotiated and entered into subaward agreements, obligating \n15  $96,625,388 to subrecipients; and through subrecipients, issued \n16  requests for proposals and selected and notified vendors for contracts \n17  totaling $4,895,205 to support the administration of its state SFA \n18  program. \n19  B.  President Trump Issues Executive Orders Targeting Clean Energy \n20  61.  Immediately after his inauguration on January 20, 2025, President Trump \n21  issued an Executive Order instructing executive agencies to “immediately pause the \n22  disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public \n23  Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58).” Exec. \n24  Order No. 14154, Unleashing American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8354 (Jan. 29, 2025) at \n25  § 7 (“Unleashing EO”).  \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   13  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 14 of 39\n \n1  62.  Consistent with the President’s pronouncement and a subsequent directive \n2  from the Office of Management & Budget (“OMB”), EPA unlawfully froze all SFA Funds, \n3  along with funding for other programs under both the Inflation Reduction Act and the \n4  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  \n5  63.  For a period following OMB’s directive, Plaintiffs were unable to draw down \n6  their duly obligated SFA Funds. EPA’s unlawful and arbitrary funding freeze was ultimately \n7  enjoined by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island on March 6, 2025. See \n8  New York v. Trump, 769 F. Supp. 119 (D. R.I. Mar. 6, 2025). \n9  64.  Concurrent with the unlawful Unleashing EO, President Trump issued a \n10  second Executive Order purporting to declare a “National Energy Emergency.” Exec. Order \n11  14156, Declaring a National Energy Emergency, 90 Fed. Reg. 8433 (Jan. 29, 2025) \n12  (“Energy Emergency EO”). One of the energy-related problems that the Energy Emergency \n13  EO purports to address is that “our Nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure \n14  causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those \n15  living on low- and fixed-incomes.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 8434.  \n16  65.  While the Energy Emergency EO announced the need for emergency \n17  measures to encourage development of “a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of \n18  energy,” it arbitrarily excluded solar energy from the list of resources that executive \n19  agencies could deploy to combat the alleged “energy emergency,” without offering any \n20  justification for that exclusion. 90 Fed. Reg. at 8434, § 8(a). \n21  C.  EPA Targets the SFA Program \n22  66.  On January 29, 2025, the Senate confirmed Defendant Lee Zeldin as EPA \n23  Administrator.  \n24  67.  In late February, Administrator Zeldin appeared on Fox News and discussed \n25  the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. He stated that EPA was working to “re-establish \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   14  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 15 of 39\n \n1  accountability and oversight” over the grant programs and that the “entire scheme, in [his] \n2  opinion, is criminal.”9 \n3  68.  Later in the appearance, Administrator Zeldin acknowledged that “agencies \n4  should not be coming up with their own interpretations of what law is” and instead should \n5  be “following our obligations under the law.”10 \n6  69.  On March 2, EPA asked its Office of Inspector General to initiate an \n7  investigation into the entire Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, citing “alleged \n8  misconduct, waste, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud.”11  \n9  70.  On March 19, EPA’s Office of Inspector General announced an audit of the \n10  SFA Program, stating that its “objective [was] to describe the status of funds, top recipients, \n11  and potential risks and impacts of EPA’s [SFA] program within the Office of the \n12  Administrator’s Office of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.”12 \n13  71.  Upon information and belief, EPA’s Office of Inspector General’s SFA audit \n14  has not been completed. \n15  D.  Congress repeals Clean Air Act Section 134 and rescinds unobligated funds \n16  72.  On July 3, 2025, Congress passed its budget reconciliation bill, H.R. 1. \n17  Section 60002 of H.R. 1 provides:  \n18  Section 134 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7434) is repealed and the \nunobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section (as \n19  in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act) are rescinded. \n20 \n73.  Section 60002 of H.R. 1 contains two operative clauses. \n21 \n \n22  9 Sunday Morning Futures, Partnership with DOGE ‘has been outstanding,’ EPA Administrator Zeldin \nsays, (FOXNEWS television broadcast Feb. 23, 2025), https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369222506112.  \n23  10 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47), X (Feb. 23, 2025), \nhttps://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1893689799254356000.  \n11  Letter from W.C.

First, Congress directed that Clean Air Act Section 134 “is repealed.” This refers \n2  to the portion of Section 134 authorizing EPA to establish and administer the SFA Program. \n3  This means that no future Congress can appropriate funds for the purpose of making \n4  competitive grants under Section 134 without first enacting a new authorizing statute. This does \n5  not mean, however, that EPA is without authority to administer the SFA Program as to the \n6  current SFA Recipients.  \n7  75.  Second, Congress directed that any “unobligated balances of amounts” \n8  previously appropriated to perform the activities described in Clear Air Act Section 134 “are \n9  rescinded.” This means that no Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund funds that were obligated as of \n10  July 3, 2025 were rescinded.  \n11  76.  Plaintiffs’ SFA Funds were all obligated well before Clean Air Act Section \n12  134(a)(1)’s September 30, 2024 deadline, and were, therefore, not rescinded by H.R. 1. EPA is \n13  authorized to continue to administer the SFA Program as to the SFA Recipients, including \n14  Plaintiffs.   \n15  77.  Legislative history and materials confirm this plain meaning of H.R. 1.  \n16  78.  The  bill  summary  explains  that  Section  60002  of  H.R.  1  “repeals  and \n17  rescinds unobligated funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund . . . .”13  \n18  79.  In committee meetings in May, Representative Morgan Griffith (R-VA), \n19  then-Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on the \n20  Environment, affirmed the following regarding the effect of H.R. 1:  \n21  •  Congress “can’t rescind expenditures that have already been obligated. . . .”14 \n22  •  “[I]f a grant was already given, as far as this bill is concerned, then that \n23  would still be going forward.”15  \n \n24 \n13 H.R. 1., 19th Cong.

Representative Brett Guthrie (R-KY), Chair of the House Energy and \n4  Commerce Committee likewise explained that H.R. 1 “does not close the grants on any \n5  obligated funds.”17 \n6  81.  Before H.R. 1 was enacted, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) \n7  “scored” the bill and estimated that repealing and rescinding unobligated funds from all \n8  three of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grant programs would only net $19 million in \n9  savings, none of which included the appropriation under Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(1). \n10  Upon information and belief, the $19 million in savings refers to approximately the \n11  remaining balance of the funds appropriated for EPA’s administrative costs under 42 U.S.C. \n12  § 7434(a)(4), and is far less than the total obligated funds. This estimate was known to \n13  Congress prior to passing H.R. 1.   \n14  82.  The Republican Senate Majority accepted CBO’s $19 million savings \n15  estimate as evidenced by an August 14, 2025 letter from thirty Senators.18 \n16  83.  It was also accepted by the House. “The budgetary significance of this \n17  provision is questionable, as only $19 million is available out of the entire $27 billion \n18  appropriated. This remaining money is allocated for administrative purposes.” H.R. Rep. \n19  No. 119-106(I) at 627 (2025). \n20  84.  After H.R. 1’s enactment, CBO issued a July 21, 2025 report reiterating its \n21  assessment that repealing and rescinding unobligated funds from all three of the Greenhouse \n22  Gas Reduction Fund grant programs would only net $19 million in savings.  \n \n23 \n15 Id. at 5:40:22-5:40:29. \n16 Id. at 5:40:34-5:40:40. \n24 \n17 Id. at 5:41:55-5:42:02. \n18 Letter from Sen.

The $19 million in unobligated funds rescinded under H.R. 1 did not \n2  eliminate EPA’s ability to fund its administration of the SFA Program because Congress’s \n3  original $30 million appropriation was not the exclusive source of funding for EPA’s \n4  Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund administrative costs. To the contrary, Congress expressly \n5  appropriated $30 million for administrative costs “in addition to amounts otherwise \n6  available.” Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(4). \n7  86.  Alternative sources of administrative funding were available to EPA on \n8  August 7, 2025.  For example, on March 15, 2025, Congress passed a continuing resolution \n9  for Fiscal Year 2025 appropriating $3,195,028,000 in funding for “Environmental \n10  Protection Agency—Environmental Programs and Management,” which was unaffected by \n11  H.R. 1 and could be used by EPA to fund its administration of the SFA Program.19  \n12  87.  Upon information and belief, Defendants did not immediately understand \n13  H.R. 1 to terminate the SFA Program or the administration of it. Rather, EPA staff \n14  continued to administer the SFA Program for a period of time following the enactment of \n15  H.R. 1.  \n16  E.  EPA Terminates the SFA Program Based Solely on the H.R. 1 Interpretation \n17  88.  On or before August 7, 2025, ignoring the plain text of Section 60002, the \n18  wealth of legal authority instructing against rescission by implication, and pre- and post-\n19  enactment legislative materials confirming the limited, prospective effect of Section 60002, \n20  Defendants devised the H.R. 1 Interpretation. \n21  89.  Defendants then relied on the erroneous H.R. 1 Interpretation in issuing the \n22  Program Termination Directive on August 7, 2025. \n23 \n \n24 \n19 Full Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, Pub. L. No. 119-4, § 1802(3), 139 Stat. 9, \n30 (2025).

Administrator Zeldin articulated the Program Termination Directive in a post \n2  on X in which he disparaged the SFA Program as a “boondoggle”:  \n3   \n4   \n5   \n6   \n7   \n8   \n9   \n10   \n11 \n12  91.  Along with the X post, Administrator Zeldin posted a video20 on EPA’s \n13  verified YouTube account in which he referred to the SFA Program as a “grift” and made a \n14  series of baseless accusations about the Program:   \n15  •  “[O]ne of the more shocking features of Solar for All was with regards to the \n16  massive dilution of the money, as many grants go through pass through after \n17  pass through after pass through after pass through with all of the middlemen \n18  taking their own cut—at least 15% by conservative estimates;” \n19  •  the SFA Program is “exempted” from federal laws requiring “federal \n20  agencies to use American workers, American Products, and American \n21  infrastructure for projects using American taxpayer dollars;” and \n22  •  “very little money has been spent.” \n23  92.  Shortly after this announcement, each SFA Recipient, including each \n24  Plaintiff, received a nearly identical Termination Memorandum from EPA Award Official \n25 \n \n20 U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, Administrator Lee Zeldin Announces EPA Is Ending Solar For All, \n26 \nYOUTUBE (Aug. 8, 2025), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfU3bYKmBOA.  \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   19  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 20 of 39\n \n1  Devon Brown. The Termination Memorandum explained that Defendants had “made the \n2  decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants because the EPA no longer has a \n3  statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering and overseeing” the Program. \n4  See Exh. A. The Termination Memorandum purported to implement the Program \n5  Termination Directive and explained that the justification for doing so was the H.R. 1 \n6  Interpretation.  \n7  93.  The Termination Memorandum identified the following components of \n8  Defendant’s H.R. 1 Interpretation: \n9  a.  The “grant appropriations . . . are rescinded;” \n10  b.  EPA lacks “substantive legal authority [and] the financial \n11  appropriations needed to continue implementation, oversight, or \n12  monitoring . . . of these grants or of Solar for All;” \n13  c.   “[T]he SFA Program is no longer to operate;” and  \n14  d.  “Any attempt to continue to program’s administration . . . is no longer \n15  legal permissible.” Id. \n16  94.  The Program Termination Directive, and the H.R. 1 Interpretation on which \n17  it is based, are contrary to H.R. 1’s plain language, for several reasons.  \n18  95.  First, Congress did not direct Defendants to terminate the SFA Program or \n19  prohibit Defendants from administering the SFA Program as to existing SFA Recipients.   \n20  96.  Second, not only did Congress not expressly state that “the grant \n21  appropriations . . . are rescinded,” it stated the opposite: only the unobligated balances of \n22  any amount “made available to carry out” Clean Air Act Section 134 are rescinded.   \n23  97.  Third, while it is true that Section 60002 rescinds the unobligated balance of \n24  funds previously appropriated for “administrative costs,” the rescission of these funds did \n25  not deprive Defendants of the “financial appropriations needed to continue implementation, \n26  oversight or monitoring” of the SFA Program, particularly when Congress originally \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 21 of 39\n \n1  appropriated the funds “in addition to amounts otherwise available.” Clean Air Act Section \n2  134(a)(4).  \n3  98.  Fourth, “courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has \n4  unambiguously instructed retroactivity.” Vartelas v. Holders, 566 U.S. 257, 266 (2012). \n5  H.R. 1 Section 60002 contains no express or implied direction that its requirements be \n6  applied retroactively.   \n7  99.  Finally, the Program Termination Directive, and the H.R. 1 Interpretation on \n8  which it relies, are also in significant tension with 1 U.S.C. § 109, which provides that: “The \n9  repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, \n10  or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, \n11  and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any \n12  proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.”  \n13  100.  Members of Congress swiftly told Defendants that the Program Termination \n14  Directive was contrary to H.R. 1.   \n15  101.  For example, on August 11, three members of Congress wrote to \n16  Administrator Zeldin that he had “falsely claimed that passage and enactment of \n17  H.R. 1 . . . gives [him] the authority to take back obligated funds.” Contrary to this claim, \n18  “grant funding awarded before [H.R. 1] was enacted . . . does not constitute unobligated \n19  funds subject to H.R. 1.”21   \n20  102.  On August 14, thirty-two Senators wrote to Administrator Zeldin to \n21  emphasize that all awarded SFA grants had been obligated for a year, and that EPA’s attacks \n22  on SFA “continued a pattern of false statements” about Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \n23  programs.22  \n \n24 \n21 Letter from Rep.

Similarly, on August 14, members of Arizona’s Congressional delegation \n2  and Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs told Administrator Zeldin and OMB Director Russell \n3  Vought that “[r]etracting obligated Solar for All funds is an encroachment on Congress’s \n4  fiscal authority and a violation of established federal regulations.” They demanded “a full \n5  and immediate disbursement” of Arizona’s SFA funds.23  \n6  104.  Thus, Defendants’ categorical termination of the SFA Program is \n7  incompatible with Congress’s express directive that only funds that were unobligated prior \n8  to H.R. 1’s enactment should be rescinded. \n9  F.  EPA’s Termination of the SFA Program Includes Cutting Off Funds to the SFA \nRecipients \n10 \n11  105.   EPA’s form Termination Memorandum assured Plaintiffs that they “may \n12  request payment from [ASAP] system for allowable costs incurred up to the date of this \n13  memo provided that such costs were contained in the approved workplan.” See Exh. A.  \n14  106.  Despite these assurances, on or before August 8, 2025, Defendants devised \n15  the Deobligation Directive, and upon information and belief, directed EPA staff to claw \n16  back all remaining SFA Funds previously obligated and made available to the SFA \n17  Recipients, including Plaintiffs. \n18  107.  Defendants’ implementation of the Deobligaton Directive was hasty, \n19  inconsistent, and unexplained. For example, beginning on August 8, Defendants \n20  “suspended” many (but not all) Plaintiffs’ ASAP accounts. This prevented many Plaintiffs \n21  from drawing down any of their obligated SFA Funds, even for allowable costs incurred \n22  prior to August 7.  \n23 \n \n24 \n655d295fc0e2/D93F6E6E26805AFA241C4D39073BED3B75A6F496F4350B82CC4D782AAE9BC35C.8.14.2\n5-letter-to-epa-re-solar-for-all.pdf. \n25 \n23 Letter from Gov. Katie Hobbs, et al., to Hon. Russell Vought & Hon. Lee Zeldin, Env’t Prot.

Seemingly in response to outreach from some Plaintiffs, between August 11 \n2  and August 18, Defendants changed (or caused to be changed) many of (but again, not all) \n3  Plaintiffs’ ASAP account statuses from “suspended” to “liquidated,” making the SFA Funds \n4  in these accounts available for drawdowns again. \n5  109.  Concurrent with the change in account statuses, Defendants also reduced \n6  Plaintiffs’ available account balances to ten percent or less of what the balance was on \n7  August 7, 2025. For example, on August 8, 2025, Arizona’s SFA ASAP Account had an \n8  available balance of $155,678,188.41. On August 18, Arizona’s SFA ASAP Account had an \n9  available balance of $10,891,908.14. Likewise, Michigan’s ASAP account had an available \n10  balance of $154,709,215.59 on August 6, which had dropped to just $10,148,931.94 by \n11  August 11. And California’s ASAP account dropped from $249,045,222.95 on August 7 to \n12  just $17,422,106.08 on August 11. \n13  110.  Defendants did not provide and have not provided Plaintiffs with any \n14  explanation for why Defendants removed the funds from Plaintiffs’ accounts.   \n15  111.  Upon information and belief, Defendants removed the vast majority of the \n16  remaining SFA Funds from all recipient accounts based on the flawed H.R. 1 Interpretation \n17  in a calculated effort to enforce the erroneous Program Termination Directive and \n18  Deobligation Directive.   \n19  112.  As of the date of this filing, many Plaintiffs’ ASAP accounts remain in a \n20  “liquidated” status and Defendants have not restored Plaintiffs’ available balances to August \n21  7, 2025 levels.  \n22  G.  Plaintiffs Timely Submitted Administrative Disputes to EPA Challenging the \nTermination of Their Individual Grants and Challenging the Termination of the \n23  SFA Program \n24  113.  Defendants’ form Termination Memorandum outlined a dispute process \n25  pursuant to 2 C.F.R. 1500.15 with a deadline of 30 days to submit a dispute to EPA. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 24 of 39\n \n1  114.  Plaintiffs timely submitted disputes to EPA pursuant to Part 1500 and \n2  thereby challenged EPA’s termination of their individual grants and the Program \n3  Termination Directive. \n4  115.  2 C.F.R. 1500.15 does not establish a jurisdictional exhaustion requirement.  \n5  116.  Even if it did, Plaintiffs are not required to exhaust available administrative \n6  remedies because agency review is plainly futile in light of EPA’s H.R. 1 Interpretation. \n7  117.  Upon information and belief, the Dispute Decision Official responsible for \n8  resolving each Plaintiff’s Part 1500 dispute lacks authority to overturn or disregard either \n9  the agency-wide H.R. 1 Interpretation or the Program Termination Directive.  \n10  118.  Without this Court’s order vacating the Program Termination Directive and \n11  the underlying H.R. 1 Interpretation, Plaintiffs’ Part 1500 disputes are futile.  \n12  H.  The Deobligation of the SFA Funds Is Unlawful and Must Be Enjoined by the \nCourt to Preserve the Availability of Those Funds for the SFA Program \n13 \n14  119.  As stated supra, Congress’s SFA appropriation was a time-limited, multi-\n15  year appropriation. EPA obligated all $7 billion of the funds that Congress appropriated \n16  pursuant to Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(1) by August 16, 2024, before the appropriation \n17  expired on September 30, 2024. Therefore, at the close of the Fiscal Year 2024, these \n18  obligated funds were placed in an “expired” treasury account, where they retain their 2024 \n19  fiscal-year identity.24    \n20  120.  This means that, so long as the SFA Funds retain their “obligated” status, the \n21  SFA Funds remain available to fund the SFA Program for five years after those funds \n22  expire, i.e., until September 30, 2029.25   \n23  / / / \n24  / / / \n \n25 \n24   U.S. Gov’t Accountability Off., Principles of Federal Appropriations Law (“GAO Redbook”) \nat 5-72, available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/2019-11/202437. \n26 \n25   GAO Redbook at 5-72.  \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   24  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 25 of 39\n \n1  121.  However, if the SFA Funds become deobligated, they will generally no \n2  longer available for EPA to obligate for non-SFA purposes because they expired at the end \n3  of Fiscal Year 2024.26  \n4  122.  EPA has no lawful authority to deobligate any of Plaintiffs’ funds because \n5  (1) Congress directed EPA to appropriate the SFA Funds, EPA obligated the  SFA Funds, \n6  and Congress did not direct that the SFA Funds be deobligated; (2) Defendants’ H.R. 1 \n7  Interpretation and Program Termination Directive are unlawful; and (3) proper deobligation \n8  by an executive agency can only occur after the natural end of the grant period or a lawful \n9  termination of the grant agreement and, even then, only upon compliance with the closeout \n10  procedures identified in 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.344, .345. \n11  123.  Because Defendants had no legal basis to terminate the SFA Program, \n12  Defendants cannot lawfully take any steps to deobligate the SFA Funds.  \n13  124.  A Court order enjoining the Deobligation Directive is necessary to ensure \n14  that the SFA Funds remain available to be restored or redistributed to the SFA Recipients if \n15  this Court vacates the Program Termination Directive. \n16  II.  PLAINTIFFS’ HARMS \n17  125.  Defendants’ implementation of the unlawful H.R. 1 Interpretation, Program \n18  Termination Directive, and Deobligation Directive has harmed and will continue to harm \n19  Plaintiffs and their respective residents. \n20  126.  Plaintiffs committed resources, launched programs, entered into agreements, \n21  and moved forward in reliance on EPA’s continued administration of the SFA Program. \n22  After months of cooperation, coordinated planning and reliance, Defendants’ wholesale \n23  programmatic termination not only upended Plaintiffs’ efforts and reasonable reliance, but \n24  also stripped away the promised climate and community benefits – clean energy access, cost \n25 \n \n26 \n26   GAO Redbook at 5-71.  \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   25  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 26 of 39\n \n1  savings, and equity investments – that the Congressionally mandated SFA Program was \n2  designed to deliver.  \n3  127.  Plaintiffs relied upon the SFA Program to meet benchmarks for clean energy \n4  production, to create jobs, to limit environmental damage caused by pollutants, and to \n5  generate energy cost savings for households, including in low-income and disadvantaged \n6  communities. \n7  128.  The Program Termination Directive and Deobligation Directive also harm \n8  Plaintiffs and their residents, who relied upon SFA participation in meeting statutory clean \n9  energy and climate goals, completing projects that would have qualified for federal tax \n10  credits expiring on December 31, 2025, achieving sustainability standards, crafting policy \n11  initiatives, and implementing clean energy programs as part of the work plan process.  \n12  129.  The Program Termination Directive and Deobligation Directive terminate \n13  and defund the SFA Program. Even if Plaintiffs successfully appeal the termination of their \n14  SFA grants through administrative procedures, they may not be able to access any SFA \n15  Funds because of the Deobligation Directive, meaning SFA Funds will become or have \n16  already been rendered unavailable, and may indeed expire. \n17  130.  The underlying unlawful H.R. 1 Interpretation also makes the Plaintiff’s \n18  ability to challenge their individual grant terminations likely futile. Thus, vacatur of the \n19  H.R. 1 Interpretation may increase Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on any direct challenges \n20  to the individual grant terminations in other forums.   \n21  III.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n22  Count I \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \n23 \nContrary to Law/In Excess of Statutory Authority \n24 \n131.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations.  \n25  / / / \n26  / / / \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   26  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 27 of 39\n \n1  132.  The H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and the \n2  Deobligation Directive are each a final agency action, taken separately and/or in \n3  combination. 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \n4  133.  Under the APA, a reviewing court must set aside a challenged agency action \n5  if the action is “not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or “in excess of statutory \n6  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” id. § 706(2)(C). \n7  134.  An agency may not take any action that exceeds the scope of its statutory or \n8  constitutional authority or is otherwise contrary to law.  \n9  135.  Agency action is not in accordance with the law if the action contravenes or \n10  otherwise fails to implement the statutory directives of Congress consistent with the \n11  statute’s text, structure, and purpose.  \n12  136.  Here, Congress appropriated $7 billion for the SFA Program and directed \n13  that Defendants obligate those funds to qualified recipients by September 30, 2024.  These \n14  funds were timely obligated to the SFA Recipients, including to Plaintiffs. \n15  137.  Section 60002 of H.R. 1 did not authorize or direct Defendants to terminate \n16  the SFA Program.  \n17  138.  Section 60002 of H.R. 1 did not authorize or direct Defendants to rescind any \n18  funds that were obligated prior to the date that H.R. 1 was enacted.  \n19  139.  Section 60002 expressly excluded Plaintiffs’ awards from rescission because \n20  Plaintiffs’ awards were fully obligated months prior to “the day before the date of enactment \n21  of [the] Act.” \n22  140.  The H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and the \n23  Deobligation Directive unlawfully exceed Defendants’ statutory authority under H.R. 1, \n24  which only authorizes the rescission of unobligated funds.  \n25  141.  The H.R. 1 Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and Deobligation \n26  Directive are contrary to law because, among other things: \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   27  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 28 of 39\n \n1  a.  They affect already-obligated funds, not unobligated funds;  \n2  b.  Congress did not direct or otherwise authorize Defendants to \n3  terminate the SFA Program;  \n4  c.  Section 60002 of H.R. 1 does not apply retroactively; and  \n5  d.  Section 60002 of H.R. 1 does not extinguish prior liabilities.  \n6  142.  Plaintiffs are entitled to (1) a declaration that Defendants’ H.R. 1 \n7  Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and Deobligation Directive are contrary to \n8  law, in excess of Defendants’ statutory authority, and violate the APA; (2) vacatur of \n9  Defendants’ H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and the Deobligation \n10  Directive, and (3) injunctive relief preventing Defendants from implementing or enforcing \n11  the H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and the Deobligation \n12  Directive.  \n13  Count II \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n14 \nArbitrary and Capricious \n15  143.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations.  \n16  144.  The H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and the \n17  Deobligation Directive are each a final agency action, taken separately and/or in \n18  combination. 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \n19  145.  The APA requires that a court “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . \n20  found to be . . . arbitrary [or] capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n21  146.  An agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has “relied on \n22  factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an \n23  important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to \n24  the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a \n25  difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the \n26  U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). In other words, agency \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   28  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 29 of 39\n \n1  action is arbitrary or capricious where it is not “reasonable and reasonably explained.” \n2  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).  \n3  147.  An agency must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons \n4  that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New \n5  York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019). Agencies may not rely on explanations that are “contrived” \n6  or “incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and \n7  decisionmaking process.” Id.  \n8  148.  Agency action taken on pretextual grounds violates the APA’s requirements \n9  of reasoned agency decision-making.  \n10  149.  Agency action is also arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails to consider \n11  reasonable alternatives or other important factors, such as legitimate reliance interests.  \n12  150.  Defendants have identified nothing other than the H.R. 1 Interpretation to \n13  support the Program Termination and Deobligation Directives.  \n14  151.  Defendants’ sole stated rationale for the Program Termination Directive is \n15  the H.R. 1 Interpretation that “EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to \n16  continue administering and overseeing the nearly $7 billion outlay to approximately 60 \n17  grant recipients.” Exh. A. The H.R. 1 Interpretation is an incorrect, irrational, and \n18  insufficient explanation and thus not a reasoned basis for that action.  \n19  152.  Defendants’ prior statements and actions demonstrate that their reliance upon \n20  the H.R. 1 Interpretation was pretextual and that the real basis for the Program Termination \n21  Directive was their desire to eliminate a “boondoggle” and implement an anti-solar energy \n22  agenda. \n23  153.   Defendants instructed EPA’s Office of Inspector General to undertake an \n24  audit of the SFA Program but terminated the SFA Program without waiting to see whether \n25  the results of the audit confirmed any of Defendants suspicions regarding “misconduct, \n26  waste, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud” within the SFA Program.  \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   29  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 30 of 39\n \n1  154.  Defendants’ H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and \n2  the Deobligation Directive are arbitrary and capricious because, among other things: \n3  a.  Defendants provided no reasoned basis for the actions; \n4  b.  Defendants ignored Plaintiffs’ and subrecipients’ substantial reliance \n5  interests, and the harmful impact of an abrupt and complete \n6  termination of the SFA Program before deciding to terminate the \n7  program; and \n8  c.  Defendants failed to consider reasonable alternatives to terminating \n9  the entire program, including whether it could continue administering \n10  the SFA Program as to the existing grants by using some of the \n11  $3,195,028,000 that Congress appropriated to EPA in March 2025 to \n12  pay for “Environmental Programs and Management.” \n13  155.  Plaintiffs are entitled to (1) a declaration that Defendants’ H.R. 1 \n14  Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and Deobligation Directive are arbitrary and \n15  capricious and violate the APA; (2) vacatur of Defendants’ H.R. 1 Interpretation, the \n16  Program Termination Directive, and the Deobligation Directive, and (3) injunctive relief \n17  preventing Defendants from implementing or enforcing the H.R. 1 Interpretation, the \n18  Program Termination Directive, and the Deobligation Directive.  \n19  Count III \nU.S. Constitution; \n20 \n Appropriations Clause, Separation of Powers Doctrine \n21 \n156.

The U.S. Constitution’s Appropriations Clause, art. I, § 9, cl. 7, provides that \n2  “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made \n3  by Law.” \n4  159.

Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. \n9  2018). \n10  160.  Congress also possesses the power to legislate. Article I, Section 1 of the \n11  U.S. Constitution states “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n12  Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of \n13  Representative. U.S. Const., art. I, § 1.  \n14  161.  The Executive’s powers are limited to those specifically conferred by “an act \n15  of Congress or from the Constitution itself.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 \n16  U.S. 579, 585 (1952). The Executive has no power “to enact, to amend, or to repeal \n17  statutes.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998).  \n18  162.  The Constitution further provides that the executive must “take Care that the \n19  laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. Given these principles, where the \n20  Executive Branch overrides a statute or the legislative intent of Congress, it violates the \n21  separation of powers doctrine. \n22  163.  Here, Congress appropriated $7 billion for the SFA Program and directed \n23  that Defendants obligate those funds to qualified recipients by September 30, 2024.

EPA’s H.R. 1 Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and \n9  Deobligation Directive contravene H.R. 1’s plain language and Congress’s legislative intent \n10  by purporting to terminate and deobligate funds that were obligated to Plaintiffs prior to the \n11  September 30, 2024 deadline.  \n12  168.  Defendants violated constitutional separation-of-powers constraints because, \n13  through the H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and the Deobligation \n14  Directive, Defendants have overridden Congress’s considered judgments by attempting to \n15  terminate the SFA Program and rescind obligated SFA Funds.  \n16  169.  Plaintiffs are entitled to (1) a declaration that Defendants’ H.R. 1 \n17  Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and Deobligation Directive violate the \n18  Constitution’s Appropriations Clause and constitutional separation of powers principles; \n19  (2) vacatur of Defendants’ H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and \n20  the Deobligation Directive, and (3) injunctive relief preventing Defendants from \n21  implementing or enforcing the H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, \n22  and the Deobligation Directive.  \n23  Count IV  \nNon-Statutory Review Ultra Vires - Executive Action in Excess of  \n24 \nStatutory Authority \n25  170.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 33 of 39\n \n1  171.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief with \n2  respect to violations of federal law by federal officials. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \n3  Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015). \n4  172.  Congress did not authorize or direct Defendants’ categorical termination of \n5  the SFA Program. \n6  173.  The H.R. 1 Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and Deobligative \n7  Directive are incompatible with Congress’s directive that only funds that were unobligated \n8  prior to H.R. 1’s enactment should be rescinded.  \n9  174.  Defendants have no other constitutional or statutory authority to terminate \n10  the SFA Program or rescind or deobligate funds lawfully obligated to Plaintiffs.  \n11  175.  Defendants’ H.R. 1 Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and \n12  Deobligation Directive Termination Directive are ultra vires acts because no act of \n13  Congress authorizes Defendants to rescind the SFA Program’s obligated funds or otherwise \n14  terminate the SFA Program.  \n15  176.  Plaintiffs are entitled to (1) a declaration that Defendants’ H.R. 1 \n16  Interpretation, Program Termination Directive, and Deobligation Directive are ultra vires; \n17  (2) vacatur of Defendants’ H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, and \n18  the Deobligation Directive, and (3) injunctive relief preventing Defendants from \n19  implementing or enforcing the H.R. 1 Interpretation, the Program Termination Directive, \n20  and the Deobligation Directive.  \n \n21  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n22    WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n23  a.  Declare unlawful Defendants’ H.R. 1 Interpretation, Program \n24  Termination Directive, and Deobligation Directive; \n25  b.  Vacate and set aside Defendants’ H.R. 1 Guideline, Program Termination \n26  Directive, and Deobligation Directive;  \n \nCOMPLAINT – No.   33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nEnvironmental Protection Division \n800 Fifth Avenue STE 2000 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:25-cv-02015     Document 1     Filed 10/16/25     Page 34 of 39\n \n1  c.  Order Defendants to reinstate the SFA Program; \n2  d.  Enjoin Defendants from reobligating, using, expending, or otherwise \n3  placing beyond the Court’s jurisdiction any funds appropriated by \n4  Congress for the SFA Program except for purposes of the SFA Program;  \n5  e.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable fees, costs, and expenses, including \n6  attorneys’ fees; and  \n7  f.  Grant all other relief as this Court deems appropriate.  \n8  RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 16th day of October, 2025. \n \n9  KRISTIN K. MAYES  NICHOLAS W.
