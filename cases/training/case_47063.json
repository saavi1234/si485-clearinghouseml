LYONS, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, and ROBERT GUADIAN, in his official capacity as Director \nof the Denver Field Office of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  \n    Defendants. \n \nCLASS COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  \n1.  Militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents – often with \nmasks, body armor, and long guns – are showing up in neighborhoods across Colorado \nand indiscriminately stopping and arresting people with brown skin in their mission to \nmeet the Administration’s ramped-up enforcement demands. They are going door-to-\ndoor, sweeping apartment parking lots, and confronting residents and neighbors walking \nnear their homes or jobs. They are pulling over workers and college students going about \ntheir daily lives. ICE agents are then arresting Latine people without warrants, without \nprobable cause, and without assessing legal status and flight risk as required by law. \n2.  But immigration enforcement agents do not have unfettered authority to \nmake warrantless arrests. Section 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) requires that an agent have \nprobable cause to believe that the person being arrested is (1) in the United States in \n  -1- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 2\nof 48\nviolation of immigration laws and (2) likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. \nThis  means  an  arresting  immigration  officer  must  make  two  probable  cause \ndeterminations pre-arrest; otherwise, the arrest is unlawful. \n3.  ICE agents are ignoring the law’s clear requirement to assess flight risk \nbefore making a warrantless arrest. Instead, they are scrambling to fill arbitrary quotas \nset  by  the  Administration,  causing  chaos  and  terror  in  neighborhoods  throughout \nColorado. This lawsuit seeks to enjoin Defendants’ ongoing pattern and practice of \nflouting federal law in connection with their mass immigration arrests in Colorado. \n4.  Following President Trump’s second inauguration in January 2025, the \nAdministration set out to increase immigration enforcement, even if doing so required \n“push[ing] the envelope” of its authority.1  \n5.  The impact of that directive is being felt across the country and our state.  \n6.  Federal data suggest that by early March 2025, immigration enforcement \nofficers made nearly 23,000 arrests nationwide.2 By the summer, that number rose to \napproximately 60,000.3  \n \n1 Jose Olivares, US Immigration Officers Ordered to Arrest More People Even Without \nWarrants, The Guardian (June 4, 2025), https://perma.cc/4SSK-EQUC.  \n2 Albert Sun, et al., What the Data Shows About Trump’s Immigration Enforcement So \nFar, The New York Times (Mar. 4, 2025), https://perma.cc/5SCU-P38Z.    \n3 TRAC Immigration, https://perma.cc/X97P-7UMV.  \n  -2- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 3\nof 48\n7.  In Colorado alone, ICE arrested almost 2,000 people in the first half of the \nyear.4  \n8.  In late May, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) recast their goals as a quota: immigration enforcement agents must make 3,000 \nimmigration-related arrests per day or face “consequences for not hitting arrest targets.”5 \n9.   To  reach  that  number,  top  White  House  aide  Stephen  Miller  directed \nimmigration enforcement agents to change their approach to arrests in the field. These \nagents,  according  to  the  White  House,  should  no  longer  conduct  targeted  and \ninvestigation-based operations. Instead, they should “just go out there and arrest” in \npublic spaces.6  \n10.  The Administration also encouraged immigration agents to “turn the creative \nknob up to 11” when it comes to enforcement, including through arrests collateral to \nanyone actually identified in a warrant.7  \n \n4 Alayna Alvarez, et al., ICE Arrests of Noncriminals Spike in Colorado Under Trump, \nAxios (July 18, 2025), https://perma.cc/4X3N-J42B; Sandra Fish, et al., Most people \narrested by ICE in Colorado and Wyoming this year did not have a criminal history, The \nColorado Sun (July 18, 2025) https://perma.cc/Z2Z7-423D.  \n5 David J.

Migrant \nCrackdown, The Wall Street Journal (June 9, 2025), https://perma.cc/H9RU-BJNX.  \n6 Elizabeth Findell, et al., The White House Marching Orders That Sparked the L.A. \nMigrant Crackdown, The Wall Street Journal (June 9, 2025), https://perma.cc/H9RU-\nBJNX. \n7 Jose Olivares, US Immigration Officers Ordered to Arrest More People Even Without \nWarrants, The Guardian (June 4, 2025), https://perma.cc/4SSK-EQUC.  \n  -3- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 4\nof 48\n11.  Agents  effect  these  collateral  arrests  without  the  probable  cause \ndeterminations that federal law requires. \n12.  In the weeks following the White House’s 3,000-arrests-per-day directive, \ndaily arrests of noncitizens in Colorado increased by 300% compared to the prior year.8 \n13.  And there is no sign the Administration is slowing down. The Administration \nnow has tens of billions of newly appropriated dollars for expanded immigration detention \nfacilities, including tripling detention capacity in Colorado, that will provide additional \nincentive for Defendants to expand their illegal arrest scheme.9  \n14.  Our state’s 169,000 undocumented immigrants, and hundreds of thousands \nmore Latine Coloradans, now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration \nagents’  indiscriminate  practices.  ICE’s  arrest  scheme  is  tearing  families  apart  and \nterrorizing communities.  \n \n8 Sandra Fish, et al., Most people arrested by ICE in Colorado and Wyoming this year did \nnot have criminal history, The Colorado Sun (July 18, 2025), https://perma.cc/AA5D-\nUMUM; Seth Klamann, Immigration arrests in Colorado have surged under the Trump \nadministration.

The  individual  Plaintiffs’  experiences  are  representative.  ICE  agents \narrested each of them without a warrant and without any evaluation that they were likely \nto flee before a warrant could be obtained. If they had, they would have learned that each \nindividual  has  lived  in  their  respective  communities  for  years,  has  deep  family  or \ncommunity ties, has a long history of local employment or schooling, and presents no \nlikelihood  of  escape,  let  alone  probable  cause.  Plaintiffs  and  their  families  were \ndevastated by the unlawful captures and now live every day in a heightened state of fear \nof again being separated.   \n16.  Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to enjoin these unlawful and harmful \npractices in Colorado on a class-wide basis.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  Jurisdiction is proper and relief is available under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 706 (Administrative Procedure Act), 28 U.S.C. §1651 (All \nWrits Act), and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02 (Declaratory Judgment Act). \n18.  Defendants are not immune. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 702; Larson v. Domestic \n& Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689–90 (1949); Normandy Apartments, Ltd. \nv. U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev., 554 F.3d 1290, 1298 (10th Cir. 2009); Simmat v. \nU.S. Bur. of Prisons, 413 F.3d 1225, 1233 (10th Cir. 2005), abrogated on other grounds \nby Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 216 (2007).   \n19.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because at least one Plaintiff \nresides in this district and/or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claims occurred in this district. \n  -5- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 6\nof 48\nPARTIES \n20.  Plaintiff Refugio Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father who has lived in \nColorado for 20 years with his wife and four U.S.-citizen children. His children attend \nschool in the community and his family attends church together every Sunday. He is a \nlong-tenured employee who works as a finisher in construction. On May 19, 2025, \nMr. Ramirez was pulled over near his home as he was driving to work. The agents did not \ntell him why they had pulled him over. Instead, they arrested him without a warrant after \nmaking no inquiry into his ties to the community or otherwise evaluating his flight risk. An \nICE  agent  later  admitted  that  they  had  been  looking  for  someone  else  and  that \nMr. Ramirez was arrested by mistake. Mr. Ramirez was detained in ICE’s Denver Contract \nDetention Facility in Aurora, Colorado (Aurora Detention Facility) for over three months \nbefore finally securing relief in his immigration case, receiving his lawful permanent \nresidency, and being released to return home. \n21.  Plaintiff Caroline Dias Goncalves is a 19-year-old University of Utah \ncollege student and Dreamer who has lived in the United States since she was brought \nto this country at age seven. On June 5, 2025, Ms. Dias was driving along the highway \nfrom Utah to Colorado to visit a friend. Near the town of Fruita, Colorado, a Mesa County \nSheriff’s  Office  deputy  pulled  her  over  and  claimed  that  she  had  been  following  a \nsemitrailer truck too closely. The deputy released her with a warning, but secretly (and \nillegally) alerted ICE agents of Ms. Dias’ whereabouts through a Signal message. ICE \nagents then stopped her a few miles down the highway and arrested her without a warrant \n  -6- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 7\nof 48\nand without evaluating her flight risk. ICE agents took Ms. Dias to the Aurora Detention \nFacility, where she was detained for 15 days.  \n22.  Plaintiff J.S.T.10 is a 36-year-old man and asylum seeker who has lived in \nColorado for 15 years—all his adult life. For almost a decade, J.S.T. has worked for the \nsame employer, his local restaurant and community grocery store. On February 5, 2025, \nfederal immigration and law enforcement agents raided Whispering Pines Apartments, \nwhere J.S.T. lived, along with other locations in Aurora and the Denver metro area. ICE \nagents stopped J.S.T. as he was leaving the apartment parking lot to drive to his job. ICE \nagents arrested him without a warrant and without evaluating his likelihood of escape \nbefore a warrant could be obtained. ICE transported J.S.T. to the Aurora Detention \nFacility, where he languished for four weeks. \n23.  Plaintiff G.R.R. is a 32-year-old father and business owner who has lived \nin  the  United  States  for  11  years.  G.R.R.  lives  in  Colorado  Springs  and  works  in \nconstruction. On April 27, 2025, hundreds of federal agents and immigration officers \nraided a nightclub in Colorado Springs where G.R.R. was waiting as a designated driver \nfor a friend. During the raid, immigration officers arrested G.R.R. without a warrant and \nwithout evaluating his likelihood of escape before a warrant could be obtained. Officers \ntook him to the Aurora Detention Facility, where he suffered for over six weeks. \n24.  Defendant Kristi Noem is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity,  which  oversees  the  component  agencies  responsible  for  enforcing  U.S. \n \n10  Plaintiffs  J.S.T.  and  G.R.R  seek  to  proceed  under  pseudonyms  and  are \ncontemporaneously filing a motion to request that relief.  \n  -7- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 8\nof 48\nimmigration  law,  including  ICE  and  Customs  and  Border  Protection.  Plaintiffs  sue \nDefendant Noem in her official capacity for declaratory and injunctive relief only. \n25.  Defendant Todd M. Lyons is the Acting Director of ICE, an agency of the \nUnited States within DHS. Among other things, ICE is responsible for the stops, arrests, \nand custody of individuals believed to be in violation of civil immigration law. Plaintiffs sue \nDefendant Lyons in his official capacity for declaratory and injunctive relief only. \n26.  Defendant Robert Guadian is the Director of ICE’s Denver Field Office. \nPlaintiffs sue Defendant Guadian in his official capacity for declaratory and injunctive relief \nonly. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  ICE Relies on Illegal Warrantless Arrests to Meet Administration Demand \n27.  Across the state, whether during individual stops or larger-scale raids of \nplaces where predominantly Latine people live, work, and socialize, ICE has stopped and \narrested people without a warrant and without probable cause to believe the individuals \nwere in the United States in violation of the law and posed a flight risk. \n28.  For example, during raids of multiple apartment complexes in the Aurora \nand Denver metro area in early 2025, heavily armed ICE agents knocked on every door, \nasking tenants to provide identification and questioning tenants about their immigration \nstatus without presenting a warrant or explaining why they were there.11  \n \n11 Janet Oravetz, et al., ICE Raids Target at least 7 Locations in Denver, Aurora, Thornton, \n9  News  (Feb.  5,  2025), https://perma.cc/M2GG-AVL5; Kevin  Beaty,  et  al.,  ICE  and \nFederal Agents Raid Multiple Metro Denver Apartments Early Wednesday, Denverite \n(Feb. 5, 2025), https://perma.cc/L9T7-ZY4K/; Sam Tabachnik, ICE Raids Hit Buildings in \n \n  -8- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 9\nof 48\n29.  Tenants felt fear and terror when faced by yelling agents with guns in hand. \n30.  ICE agents made several warrantless arrests of people they encountered \nwhile going door-to-door. \n31.  On February 5, 2025 alone, ICE agents conducted raids in at least seven \napartment complexes and communities across Denver, Aurora, and Thornton.12 \n32.  On April  27,  2025,  federal  immigration  enforcement  officers  flooded  a \nnightclub in Colorado Springs with tear gas to funnel patrons out and stop as many people \nas  they  could.13  Without  performing  any  flight  risk  analysis,  these  officers  made \nwarrantless arrests and filled buses with people to send to the Aurora Detention Facility. \n33.  As recently as late September 2025, ICE has been active in Colorado’s \nFront Range, mountain towns and the Western Slope, making warrantless arrests.14  \n \nAurora and Denver; Feds Say they Targeted Tren de Aragua Gang, The Denver Post \n(Feb. 5, 2025), https://perma.cc/PP7W-D5TS; Allison Sherry, et al., As ICE Expands its \nColorado Efforts, Many Without Criminal Records Are Caught in a Wide Net, CPR (Apr. \n7, 2025), https://perma.cc/M2GT-RNBJ (describing ICE practice of arresting “people who \nwere in the wrong place at the wrong time when ICE agents descended on an area to \nmake targeted arrests of accused or convicted criminals also in the country without \nauthorization”); Kevin Beaty, What we saw from inside ICE’s raid at Aurora’s Edge \napartments, Denverite (Feb. 6, 2025), https://perma.cc/E663-K7VS; Jeffrey Cook, With \nICE Agents going door-to-door in Colorado, residents are on edge: Reporter’s notebook, \nABC News (Feb. 7, 2025), https://perma.cc/R76C-KJDH. \n12 Janet Oravetz, et al., ICE Raids Target at least 7 Locations in Denver, Aurora, Thornton, \n9 News (Feb. 5, 2025), https://perma.cc/M2GG-AVL5.  \n13 Joe Hernandez, The DEA says 114 immigrants in the U.S. illegally were arrested at a \nColorado nightclub, NPR News (Apr. 27, 2025), https://perma.cc/UR9V-HNUU. \n14 Ryan Fish, ICE activity reported in Colorado mountain towns, sparking community \nconcerns, ABC News (Sept. 25, 2025),https://perma.cc/F2D8-NDHC.  \n  -9- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 10\nof 48\n34.

Stop and Arrest of Refugio Ramirez Ovando \n35.  Plaintiff Refugio Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father of four U.S.-citizen \nchildren. He has lived in Colorado for the past twenty years, currently near Grand \nJunction. He has worked in the construction concrete industry as a finisher and is one of \nthe longest-tenured employees (over 18 years) at his company.  \n36.  Mr. Ramirez’s children are all enrolled in school, and his oldest daughter is \nin her senior year of the prestigious International Baccalaureate program at her high \nschool. She plans to attend college after graduation.  \n37.  Mr. Ramirez is an active member of his church and attends most Sundays \nwith his family.  \n38.  At around 6:10 a.m. on May 19, 2025, Mr. Ramirez left his home to go to \nwork.  \n39.  When Mr. Ramirez got into his car, he saw two unmarked vehicles driving \non  his  street;  both  had  emergency  lights  inside  them  like  the  kind  used  by  law \nenforcement.  \n \n15 Kevin Beaty, Immigration arrests have quintupled in Denver under Trump, Denverite \n(Aug. 20, 2025), https://perma.cc/28RQ-2XVU.  \n  -10- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 11\nof 48\n40.  One  of  the  vehicles, a  black SUV,  began following  him  as he  left  his \nneighborhood.  \n41.  The second vehicle, a gray car, followed behind the black SUV.  \n42.  Once Mr. Ramirez left his neighborhood and reached a stoplight, the black \nSUV turned on its emergency lights and signaled to Mr. Ramirez to pull over.  \n43.  Mr. Ramirez quickly complied. Both the black SUV and the gray car parked \nbehind him.  \n44.  A man wearing a vest marked “POLICE” got out of the black SUV and \nwalked around to the driver’s side of Mr. Ramirez’s car.  \n45.  The man also had a badge marked “ICE” clipped to his pants and was visibly \narmed with a handgun.  \n46.  A man from the gray car approached the passenger’s side of Mr. Ramirez’s \ncar. This  agent  was also dressed  in  civilian  clothes under a tactical  vest  that  said \n“POLICE” and was visibly armed. \n47.  The agent from the black SUV, speaking Spanish, ordered Mr. Ramirez to \nturn off his car, place the keys on the dashboard, and roll down his window. He ordered \nMr. Ramirez to provide identification.  \n48.  Mr. Ramirez handed him his valid Colorado driver’s license, which showed \nhis address in the neighborhood close by.  \n49.  The agent nevertheless asked Mr. Ramirez for his consular ID and passport. \nMr. Ramirez replied that he did not need a consular ID because he had a driver’s license \nand that his daughter could bring his passport. The agent said that was not necessary. \n  -11- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 12\nof 48\n50.  The agent took Mr. Ramirez’s license back to the black SUV, while the other \nagent continued to stand at the passenger side of Mr. Ramirez’s car without speaking.  \n51.  The first agent came back and gave Mr. Ramirez’s license to him. He asked \nwhere Mr. Ramirez was from, whether he had permission to be in the United States, and \nwhether he had any papers to show his legal status.  \n52.  Mr. Ramirez stayed quiet but asked the agent if he was under arrest or free \nto leave. The agent continued to ask the same questions and Mr. Ramirez again remained \nquiet, except to ask if he was under arrest. The agent then responded, “Okay, well now \nyou are [under arrest].” The Spanish-speaking agent opened Mr. Ramirez’s driver’s side \ncar door and ordered him to get out.  \n53.  The agents did not have a warrant for Mr. Ramirez’s arrest.  \n54.  The agents did not ask Mr. Ramirez any questions about his potential flight \nrisk, including his ties to the community, how long he had lived in the United States, his \nemployment, his family, or whether he had any criminal history.  \n55.  The Spanish-speaking agent handcuffed Mr. Ramirez and directed him to \nget into the back of the black SUV. The agent began to drive and did not tell Mr. Ramirez \nwhere  they  were  going.  While  in  the  car,  the  agent  asked  if  anyone  else  was  at \nMr. Ramirez’s home. Mr. Ramirez explained that his wife and U.S.-citizen children were \nhome.  \n56.  Mr. Ramirez was processed at a DHS Office in Grand Junction. While there, \nhe was asked about where he was born and how long he had been in the United States. \n  -12- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 13\nof 48\nHe answered and explained that the very day he was arrested was his 20th anniversary \nof his arrival in the United States.  \n57.  Mr. Ramirez overheard the Spanish-speaking agent on the phone talking \nand laughing about the coincidence that they had arrested Mr. Ramirez on the 20th \nanniversary of his arrival to the United States. Mr. Ramirez felt humiliated.  \n58.  During the processing, one of the agents told Mr. Ramirez that he had not \nbeen the person they were originally looking for, but they arrested him anyway. \n59.  At around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m., ICE agents transferred Mr. Ramirez to the \nAurora Detention facility. Mr. Ramirez was detained from May 19, 2025, until August 26, \n2025.  \n60.  During that time, some of the guards blocked detainees’ phone calls, even \nwith attorneys – and some days, Mr. Ramirez was not permitted to make calls at all.  \n61.  The air conditioning was often broken, and it became unbearably hot in the \ncells.  \n62.  When elected officials came to visit the facility, the facility would be cleaned \nand staged for those visits to make it look better than it was in reality. Mr. Ramirez \nexperienced significant anxiety, feeling frustrated and helpless. \n63.  During Mr. Ramirez’s detention, his family suffered. Mr. Ramirez had been \nthe primary earner for his family. His wife, who had stayed home to care for their children, \nbegan selling food to pay the bills. The family had to rely on the kindness of their \ncommunity to provide food and donations for legal expenses. They sold a truck and \nborrowed money, incurring roughly $20,000 in loans and debts. Mr. Ramirez’s oldest \n  -13- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 14\nof 48\ndaughter’s mental health declined. She was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, \nGeneralized  Anxiety  Disorder,  an  Exfoliation  Disorder,  and  Post  Traumatic  Stress \nDisorder during his detention. Mr. Ramirez’s sons also began showing symptoms of \nanxiety and depression, and all of his children began attending therapy. \nii.  Stop and Arrest of Caroline Dias Goncalves  \n64.  Plaintiff Caroline Dias Goncalves is a University of Utah college student who \nhas lived in the United States since she was seven years old. She attends college on a \nmerit scholarship.16 \n65.  On the afternoon of June 5, 2025, Ms. Dias was driving on the highway from \nUtah to Colorado to visit a friend and was pulled over by a Mesa County Sherriff’s Office \ndeputy. That deputy, Alexander Zwinck, stopped her in Fruita, Colorado, claiming that she \nfollowed a semitrailer truck too closely.17 \n66.  Upon Officer Zwinck’s request, Ms. Dias gave him her driver’s license and \nother necessary paperwork. Strangely, he then asked Ms. Dias to leave her own car and \naccompany him to his patrol car. She complied.18 \n67.  Officer  Zwinck  continued  to  interrogate  Ms.  Dias  while  she  sat  in  the \npassenger seat of his patrol car. He asked her multiple questions about her road trip, \n \n16 Courtney Tanner, University of Utah student is being held at Colorado immigration \ndetention center, The Salt Lake City Tribune (June 12, 2025), https://perma.cc/SXC6-\nMQN8.  \n17 Courtney Tanner, University of Utah student is being held at Colorado immigration \ndetention center, The Salt Lake City Tribune (June 12, 2025), https://perma.cc/SXC6-\nMQN8.  \n18 McKenzie Diaz, From a road trip to ICE detention, ABC4 News (June 25, 2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/SZR6-GPJ9.  \n  -14- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 15\nof 48\nincluding whether she had “fun plans for the weekend” and if her friend was expecting \nher.19 He also asked Ms. Dias personal questions, including whether she was a college \nstudent and what she was studying. Ms. Dias shared she was studying nursing and \napplying for nursing school next spring. Officer Zwinck praised her plans, noting the \ndifficulty of her career choice. \n68.  At one point during the interrogation in Officer Zwinck’s patrol car, he asked \nMs. Dias, “Where are you from?” suggesting that she had “a bit of an accent” (she does \nnot believe she does). Ms. Dias told Officer Zwinck, “I’m from Utah.” After Officer Zwinck \npressed if she was born and raised in Utah, Ms. Dias responded that she was born in \nBrazil and moved to Utah with her parents as a child. Id.  \n69.  Officer Zwinck assured Ms. Dias. that “everything came back good” and \nsaid he would let her go with a “warning.” Officer Zwink informed her, “You’re good to go, \nyou have safe travels, OK.” Id.  \n70.  Officer  Zwinck  then  used  Signal  messaging  to alert ICE agents  about \nMs. Dias’ whereabouts.  \n71.  ICE agents stopped Ms. Dias a few miles down the highway near Grand \nJunction, Colorado.  \n72.  The agents did not wear uniforms, badges, name tags, or tactical vests.  \n73.  They did not show Ms. Dias any identification or provide their names.  \n \n19  Mesa  County  Sheriff’s  Office,  Body  Cam  Footage,  YouTube  (June  5,  2025), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IyuTMNug6E.  \n  -15- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 16\nof 48\n74.  They did not ask Ms. Dias any questions about flight risk including how long \nshe had been in the United States, her ties to the community, if she had a fixed address, \nher educational history, employment, or whether she had any criminal history.  \n75.  ICE agents arrested her, saying she had violated U.S. immigration laws and \n“We’re going to take you.”20  \n76.  They handcuffed Ms. Dias and placed her in the passenger seat of their \ntruck. Ms. Dias told the agents that she had her driver’s license and Social Security card. \nThey responded that she could have a Social Security card but still be “illegal” in the \nUnited States. \n77.  The agents drove her to the DHS Office in Grand Junction and processed \nher, taking her fingerprints and asking her to sign paperwork.  \n78.  While she was sitting in a cell, an ICE agent told her he could not release \nher—even though he preferred to arrest “criminals” and she had “never caused any \ntrouble.”  \n79.  He explained “under this president and under this presidency, we have to \narrest anyone who is not a citizen.” \n80.  The agents transported Ms. Dias “to a warehouse, chained her feet, and \nthen transferred her” to the Aurora detention facility.21  \n81.  ICE imprisoned Ms. Dias at the detention facility for 15 days.  \n \n20 McKenzie Diaz, From a road trip to ICE detention: Caroline Dias Goncalves story, ABC4 \nNews (June 25, 2025), https://perma.cc/SZR6-GPJ9.  \n21 McKenzie Diaz, From a road trip to ICE detention: Caroline Dias Goncalves story, ABC4 \nNews (June 25, 2025), https://perma.cc/SZR6-GPJ9.  \n  -16- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 17\nof 48\n82.  She felt “scared, alone, and heartbroken.”22 In a statement following her \nrelease from the unlawful detention, she shared: “The past 15 days have been the hardest \nof my life.”23 She had been “placed in a system that treated [her] like [she] didn’t matter.” \nId. While detained, she was “given soggy, wet food” and forced to keep “confusing \nschedules.” Id. She felt like her life had been “ripped away.”24 She and other detainees \nwere often forced to choose between going outside for recreation or eating breakfast; if \nthey chose to go outside, food would not be saved for them. Ms. Dias met another 19-\nyear-old woman who had been transferred to the same dormitory after receiving a death \nthreat while in detention. This left an impression on Ms. Dias as it was so frightening.  \n83.  During Ms. Dias’ detention, her family suffered too. A relative commented, \n“We can’t do anything,” and “We’re scared. We’re not in jail with her but we feel like it.”25 \nMs. Dias’ parents and siblings have started therapy to process their ongoing trauma \nrelated to her detention and have problems sleeping.  \n84.  Even after her release, Ms. Dias’ detention continues to have a profound \nimpact on her life.

As a result, she has moved to taking part-time classes \nonline, which is delaying her progress in completing her degree.  \n85.

Around 6:00 a.m. on February 5, 2025, J.S.T. left his apartment and, as was \nhis routine, got into his car to drive to work.  \n91.  That morning, federal immigration officials and law enforcement agents in \ntactical gear and armored vehicles swarmed the Whispering Pines apartment complex.  \n92.  White vans blocked the exits to the complex’s parking lot.  \n93.  Agents were conducting an enhanced immigration enforcement operation \nto meet the Administration’s ramped-up arrest quotas.  \n94.  Whispering  Pines  was  one  of  many  apartment  complexes  immigration \nagents raided in the Denver metro area that day. \n95.  An ICE officer stopped J.S.T. while he was in his vehicle and asked for \nidentification. J.S.T. provided his Colorado driver’s license.  \n96.  The officer asked J.S.T. whether he had “problems with immigration or past \ncriminal violations.” J.S.T. replied “no.” \n97.  The officer took J.S.T.’s driver’s license to a white unmarked van and never \nreturned it to J.S.T. \n98.  The officer ordered J.S.T. to step out of his car. J.S.T. complied. Immediately \nafter that, a second immigration officer ordered him to turn around and put his hands on \nthe car. That officer searched J.S.T. and took his car keys, billfold wallet, and telephone, \nnone of which he returned.  \n  -19- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 20\nof 48\n99.  The first officer, who had taken J.S.T.’s driver’s license, returned a few \nminutes later and informed J.S.T. that he “would have to go with them.” \n100.  The officer zip-tied J.S.T.’s hands.  \n101.  The officer did not have a warrant for J.S.T.’s arrest. \n102.  The officer did not ask J.S.T. any questions about his ties to the community, \nfamily, church, job at the grocery store, residence at Whispering Pines, or anything else \nregarding flight risk.  \n103.  J.S.T. asked if he could call his family. The officer refused his request and \nplaced J.S.T., hands still bound, in a van in the parking lot. \n104.  During this time, ICE officers were going door-to-door in the Whispering \nPines apartment complex and knocking on the doors of many apartments.26  \n105.  ICE officers then began questioning people inside.  \n106.  At least eight other people from the Whispering Pines apartment complex \nwere detained that day.  \n107.  The  immigration  officers  transferred  J.S.T.  to  a  smaller  vehicle  for \ntransportation, and two ICE agents took him to the ICE field office in Centennial. J.S.T. \nwas processed at the Centennial ICE office: agents took his fingerprints and biographical \ninformation and asked him questions about his prior contacts with border patrol.  \n \n26  Kevin  Beaty,  What we  saw  from  inside  ICE’s  raid  at Aurora’s  Edge  apartments, \nDenverite  (Feb.  6,  2025),  https://perma.cc/E663-K7VS  (stating  immigration  agents \n“seemed to knock on every door they could find” in other Aurora-area apartment buildings \ntargeted the same day as Whispering pines); Jeffrey Cook, With ICE Agents going door-\nto-door in Colorado, residents are on edge: Reporter’s notebook, ABC News (Feb. 7, \n2025), https://perma.cc/R76C-KJDH.  \n  -20- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 21\nof 48\n108.  ICE agents still did not ask J.S.T. about his community ties, his family, or his \nemployment. \n109.  Once J.S.T. was processed, an ICE officer chained his hands and feet \ntogether and put him on a bus for transport to the Aurora Detention Facility. While in \ndetention, J.S.T. spoke to other people who had been detained from his apartment \ncomplex. His neighbors shared that ICE did not have arrests warrants for them, nor did \nhis neighbors have criminal records.  \n110.  ICE imprisoned J.S.T. at the Aurora Detention Facility for over a month. \nDuring that time, J.S.T. was given minimal food and milk that was often spoiled. Sleeping \n“felt impossible” because the lights were always on, and guards were constantly pointing \nflashlights in J.S.T.’s face. The beds were made of metal and hard to sleep on.  \n111.  J.S.T. was only given two uniforms to wear, which were often dirty because \nthey were washed only once per week. \n112.  Eventually, J.S.T. was released on bond. But he has suffered and continues \nto suffer significant harm. J.S.T. lost his apartment and many of his belongings because \nhe could not pay rent while he was in detention.  \n113.  J.S.T., his family, and his community live in constant fear due to these \nevents. Because of the temporary living situation after losing his apartment, he cannot \nspend as much time taking care of his niece.

Stop and Arrest of G.R.R. \n114.  Plaintiff G.R.R. is a 32-year-old father and business owner who has lived in \nthe United States for more than a decade. G.R.R. currently resides in Colorado Springs. \nHe shares an apartment with his 9-year-old son (“M.R.”), ex-wife and co-parent (“A.R.”), \nboth of whom are U.S. citizens.  \n115.

G.R.R. takes pride in his work and reputation. \n116.  G.R.R. attends church most Sundays, and his church community is close-\nknit. He received many letters from his church community while he was unlawfully \ndetained. G.R.R. cares for the well-being and safety of his friends and family.  \n117.  One day, G.R.R. agreed to be his friend’s designated driver. In the early \nmorning hours of April 27, 2025, G.R.R. pulled up to a nightclub in Colorado Springs to \npick up his friend, so that his friend would not have to drive home after drinking. When \nG.R.R. arrived, his friend wasn’t answering the phone, so G.R.R. went inside to look for \nhim.  \n118.  Moments later, the nightclub was flooded with tear gas.  \n119.  Federal agents had locked the side doors from the outside of the nightclub \nto funnel all patrons out through the front. \n120.  When G.R.R. went out the front doors, he saw law enforcement officers with \nbulletproof vests, helmets, and uniforms.  \n  -22- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 23\nof 48\n121.

The armed officers were yelling and pointing assault weapons at patrons \nstreaming out of the club trying to avoid the tear gas. \n123.  G.R.R. was terrified. He had no idea what was going on. The raid was loud. \nThere were drones in the sky. G.R.R. sought safety from the officers pointing guns by \nhiding under a car in the parking lot where he stayed for ten to fifteen minutes. An officer \nin tactical gear and pointing a long gun ordered G.R.R. to get out from under the car. \nG.R.R. complied.  \n124.  As G.R.R. stood up, the officer shoved him to the ground. When G.R.R. fell, \nhe sliced his hand open on the ground and was in pain. The officer zip-tied G.R.R.’s \ninjured and uninjured hands together anyway and patted him down.  \n125.  The officer did not ask G.R.R. any questions. He simply reached into \nG.R.R.’s pockets and removed his wallet and phone. \n126.  The officer rifled through G.R.R.’s wallet and found a Colorado driver’s \npermit, Colorado state identification, and a Mexican consular card. The officer kept \nG.R.R.’s  wallet  and  phone.  He  threw  them  in  a  large  bag  along  with  belongings \nconfiscated from others.  \n127.  Later, another officer took G.R.R. to an on-site EMT to look at his hand. The \nEMT counseled that G.R.R. “probably needed stitches.” The officer disregarded the \nEMT’s advice. Instead, he instructed the EMT to “put a Band-Aid on it.” Once the EMT \n  -23- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 24\nof 48\nbandaged G.R.R.’s injury, the officer shackled G.R.R.’s feet, handcuffed his wrists, and \nconnected them to a chain on his waist. These restraints were painful.  \n128.  Up to this point, no one asked G.R.R. about his ties to the community, \nemployment,  living  circumstances  in  Colorado  Springs,  or  anything  else  to  assess \nwhether he posed a flight risk. \n129.  Hours later, around 6:00 a.m., the officer took G.R.R. to a large bus bound \nfor ICE’s Aurora Detention Facility. The bus was mostly full of nightclub goers, and \neveryone on it was a Spanish speaker. \n130.  ICE officers initially placed G.R.R. and all his bus-mates in a single holding \ncell.  \n131.  Approximately  sixty  individuals  were  in  the  cell  with  him,  all  from  the \nColorado Springs raid.  \n132.  When ICE interviewed G.R.R. at the Aurora Detention Facility, officers \nasked his name, how he came to the United States, and where he was from. They did not \nask about why he was at the nightclub or any questions about guns or drugs.  \n133.  ICE held G.R.R. at the Aurora Detention Facility for 50 days.  \n134.  The conditions in the Detention Facility were terrible.  \n135.  The beds were so hard that they hurt his back, and it took two days to see \na doctor after G.R.R. complained about his back pain.  \n136.  G.R.R. also caught a severe cold because of the low temperatures, as did \nothers.  \n  -24- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 25\nof 48\n137.  G.R.R. had to use the bathroom and showers together with the other \ndetainees. The entire situation was “extremely degrading and scary.”  \n138.  No one ever returned G.R.R.’s government-issued identifications.  \n139.  The ordeal has been extremely hard on his ex-wife A.R. and his son. His \nson M.R. has acted out behaviorally at school, and fears separation from G.R.R., refusing \nto leave G.R.R.’s side. \n140.  G.R.R.’s  detention  has  also  caused  harm  to A.R.  and  A.R.’s  mother \nbecause G.R.R. could not earn income during his detention. G.R.R.’s family depends on \nhis income for their costs of living.  \n141.  G.R.R. was (and is) terrified about what will happen to him, his son, and his \nfamily. He has constant fear of re-arrest by ICE. Members of G.R.R.’s Bible study group \nare also afraid to congregate in each other’s homes and have reduced the frequency of \ntheir meetings.  \nv.

In addition to the individual Plaintiffs, many others in Colorado have suffered \nfrom ICE’s same unlawful warrantless arrest practice over the course of the year. \na.   On the morning of February 5, 2025, J.P.P. was in his Aurora \napartment with his wife and stepdaughters, aged 12 and 16. They heard a commotion in \nthe hallways, followed by one loud bang and three loud explosions. After the explosions, \nseveral ICE officers raided the apartment, pointing long guns, and yelling in English.

At the time of his arrest, J.P.P. had a pending asylum application, had attended \nall his immigration court proceedings, and had recently provided all of his biometric data \nto ICE at a check-in appointment. J.P.P. describes the ICE raid and grenade bombs being \nthrown into his apartment as one of the most horrifying things he had ever experienced, \nand this included being tortured by police officers in Venezuela. \nb.   On March 28, 2025, O.M.R. was arrested by ICE without any \nwarrant and with no determination of likelihood of flight. O.M.R. was simply a passenger \nin a vehicle that was pulled over by ICE. At the time ICE arrested him, O.M.R. had an \nApplication  for  Temporary  Protected  Status  pending  with  the  U.S.  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Services. O.M.R. has been detained at the Denver Contract Detention Center \nin Aurora, Colorado, since his warrantless arrest on March 28, 2025. Since his detention, \nO.M.R.’s partner and children have faced eviction, and O.M.R. suffers from skyrocketing \nanxiety and a painful physical condition that is exacerbated by living at the Detention \nCenter. \nc.  J.C.C. is a 53-year-old man who has lived in the United States \nsince 1996. He has four U.S.-citizen children and owns his own concrete and landscaping \nbusiness. On the morning of July 18, 2025, J.C.C. went to the Home Depot near South \nParker, Colorado, where he bought supplies and was driving to his job. Two immigration \nofficers  pulled  him  over  and  demanded  legal  documentation.  Without  asking  any \nquestions regarding flight risk or any warrant, one of the officers arrested J.C.C., who has \nbeen in the Aurora Detention Center ever since. He and his family have experienced \n  -26- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 27\nof 48\nimmense stress and trauma and have been forced to use up nearly all of their financial \nsavings. \nd.

She describes the chaotic aftermath of ICE’s February 5, \n2025 raid at Cedar Run apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, where more than two \ndozen people were arrested without warrants and with no flight risk determinations. In the \nmonths that followed the Cedar Run raid, ICE agents have returned to those apartments \nand  others  with  a  substantial  Latine  population  where  DMTU  works,  terrifying  the \ncommunity and disrupting basic life functions. \ne.  Arturo  Vazquez  is  an  immigration  attorney  practicing  in \nDenver, Colorado. During the past few months, he has consulted with at least 15 people \nwho have been stopped, arrested, and then detained by ICE agents without a warrant in \nAurora. These warrantless arrests follow a similar pattern: ICE agents in unmarked \nvehicles pull over Latine person and obtain a suspect’s driver’s license. The driver’s \nlicense was obtained pursuant to the Colorado Road and Community Safety Act, SB13-\n251, which allows people who cannot provide proof of lawful presence in the United States \nto obtain a particular type of driver’s license. Once the ICE agent sees the SB251 license, \nwhich contains markings denoting it as such, the ICE agent orders all occupants out of \nthe car and arrests them, telling them that they are being detained for being in the country \nwithout authorization. The ICE agents do not have warrants for these arrests, and do not \nask any questions that would establish any of them were flight risks. \n  -27- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 28\nof 48\nf.  Mary  Jo  Highland  and  Daniel  Herrera  are  also  local \nimmigration attorneys who practice in Denver, Colorado. During the past two months, Ms. \nHighland has consulted with at least five people who were pulled over by ICE agents in \nunmarked  cars  then  arrested  by  ICE  without  a  warrant  and  without  any  inquiry  or \ndetermination of flight risk in Dillon, Silverthorne, and Fort Collins. Mr. Herrera has \nconsulted with at least seven people who were arrested under similar circumstances \nwithout a warrant or any assessment of flight risk in Aurora, Dillon, and Silverthorne. \ng.

During  the  past  few  months,  she  has  spoken  with \napproximately 15 people who have been stopped, arrested, and then detained by ICE in \nthe Roaring Fork Valley—all without a warrant or any determination of flight risk. During \nsome of the arrests, people were told “a warrant exists” but agents refused to produce it. \nImmigration agents engage in regular coordinated surges in activity, spending about a \nweek conducting enforcement in the Roaring Fork Valley before returning about two \nmonths later. \nh.  Shaleen Morales is a senior staff attorney with the Rocky \nMountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (RMIAN), a nonprofit legal services provider that \nrepresents detained noncitizens before the Aurora Immigration Court in Colorado. She \ndescribes numerous people locked up in the Aurora Detention Facility. For these people, \nICE’s pattern and practice has been the same: stop and arrest without a warrant or \nprobable cause that the person is in the country illegally or poses a flight risk. A few \nexamples of unlawful stops and warrantless arrests are as follows: \n  -28- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 29\nof 48\ni.  ICE arrested Individual A.A. at his workplace in Aurora. Officers arrived \nwithout  a  warrant  to  arrest  another  individual.  In  searching  for  that \nindividual, ICE also collaterally arrested A.A. when he left the workplace. He \nwas not shown a warrant for his arrest and officers did not ask him for \ninformation related to flight risk or community ties. Since his arrest this \nsummer, he is still detained.  \n \nii.  Individual E.E. was working at a restaurant in Evergreen, Colorado, when \nconfronted  by  ICE.  When  he  responded  to  questions  regarding  his \nimmigration status, ICE arrested E.E. without a warrant and without any \ndiscussion concerning flight risk or connections to the community. E.E. was \ndetained this summer and is still litigating his removal case in front of the \nImmigration Court. \niii.  Individual  F.F.  was  arriving  to  work  in  Denver,  Colorado,  when  a  law \nenforcement officer, who he thought was the local police, stopped him. ICE \nasked for F.F.’s driver’s license and asked for his “papers.” When F.F. \nconfirmed he did not have lawful status, the ICE officer arrested him and \ntwo others in the vehicle. F.F. was not asked questions concerning flight risk \nor  connections  to  community.  F.F.  is  still  detained  and  litigating  his \nimmigration case. \nB.  ICE’s Policy and Practice of Effecting Warrantless Arrests Without Making \nIndividualized Determinations of Legal Status and Flight Risk Violates \nFederal Law and ICE’s Own Policies \n143.  In the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), Congress placed restrictions \non the ability of immigration agents to conduct warrantless arrests. Section 287(a)(2) of \nthe INA, codified as 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2), imposes two conditions that must be met \nbefore an agent makes a warrantless arrest: the agent must have “reason to believe” both \nthat (1) the individual “is in the United States in violation of any [immigration] law or \n  -29- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 30\nof 48\nregulation,” and (2) the individual “is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for \nhis arrest.” Id.28 \n144.  Immigration officers have long understood that they do not have unfettered \nauthority to make warrantless arrests in the interior of the United States. The requirement \nto determine legal status and flight risk before arresting an individual without a warrant \npredates the original 1952 INA and was enacted to constrain warrantless arrests after \nimmigration officers in the 1940s were regularly effecting arrests without warrants in \nexcess of their statutory authority. \n145.  “Reason to believe,” as used in the statute, equates to the constitutional \nrequirement of probable cause, which requires an individualized inquiry particular to the \nperson at issue. \n146.  ICE agents may not make categorical assumptions about likelihood of \nescape based on a person’s apparent race and assumed immigration status. If probable \ncause to believe somebody did not have lawful presence in the country were sufficient, \nthere would be no reason to separately require probable cause that the individual also \nposed  a  flight  risk.  Instead,  §  1357  requires  agents  to  make  an  individualized \ndetermination of both status and flight risk before they can lawfully conduct a warrantless \narrest.  \n \n28 Federal regulations track the prohibition on conducting a warrantless immigration arrest \nwithout establishing likelihood of escape. See 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(ii). The federal \nregulations further require immigration officers to identify themselves and state the reason \nfor the arrest. Id. (c)(2)(iii). \n  -30- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 31\nof 48\n147.  In other words, ICE does not have authority to arrest Coloradans without a \nwarrant unless they have probable cause to believe that the person is in this country in \nviolation of immigration law and is a flight risk.  \n148.  ICE previously understood this and said as much in its own policies, even \nthough they have been ignoring the requirements on a widespread basis since at least \nJanuary 2025.  \n149.  In 2022, DHS adopted explicit requirements for agents in the field when they \nconduct any warrantless arrest under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2).  \n150.  In 2022, as part of a lawsuit settlement that applied to the Chicago ICE office \narea  of  responsibility,  DHS  issued  a  “Broadcast  Statement  of  Policy”  outlining \nrequirements for evaluation and documentation of flight risk that constitute “the underlying \nlaws and policies applicable to all arrests effected under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2).” Castañon \nNava v. DHS, No. 1:18-cv-03757, Dkt. 15-1 (Broadcast Statement of Policy), at ¶ 27.29  \n151.  Under  this  “Broadcast  Statement  of  Policy,”  immigration  officers  were \nrequired  to  consider  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  in  evaluating  an  individual’s \n“likelihood of escape,” including an individual’s community ties (such as their family, \nhome, or employment) and an individual’s prior attempts to escape or evade immigration \nauthorities. Id. at ¶ 1.  \n \n29 https://perma.cc/J8HP-VGL2.  \n  -31- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 32\nof 48\n152.  The policy further required that immigration officers who have made a \nwarrantless arrest document the facts and circumstances surrounding the warrantless \narrest “as soon as practicable.” Id. at 2.  \n153.  The  documentation  was  required  to  include,  among  other  things,  “the \nspecific, particularized facts supporting the conclusion that the alien was likely to escape \nbefore a warrant could be obtained.” Id. \n154.  In May 2025, DHS and ICE claimed that the settlement had expired and \nthen immediately rescinded the Broadcast Statement of Policy and encouraged its agents \nto engage in warrantless arrests.30 \n155.  And  even  before  DHS  rescinded  its  guidance,  ICE  was  violating  the \nrequirements of § 1357(a)(2) and facing motions to enforce in the Castañon-Nava case. \nThat Court recently found that, under the current Administration, ICE committed repeated, \nmaterial violations of the settlement by engaging in warrantless arrests in violation of the \nrequirements of § 1357(a)(2).  The Court extended the settlement agreement to February \n2,  2026,  and  ordered  ICE  to  reissue  the Broadcast  Statement of  Policy  to all  ICE \nofficers.31  \nC.

Mr. Homan has “said [] from Day 1,” that arresting any person in the U. S. \nwithout lawful presence is “not off the table” because the Administration and DHS are \n“opening th[e] aperture [of immigration enforcement policy] up.”33 \n159.  Mr. Homan has publicly stated that DHS has a new “mandate” to make \ncollateral arrests to increase their arrest numbers.34 He explained that “unlike the last \nadministration,” President Trump’s DHS is not “going to tell ICE officers not to arrest an \nillegal alien” if that noncitizen is found with others targeted by the agency.35  \n \n32 X, ICE Denver (@ERODenver) Feb. 5, 2025 9:40 AM, https://perma.cc/9UXU-7W7J \n(describing “very real public safety threat” solved by raid).  \n33 Hamed Aleaziz, Under Pressure From the White House, ICE Seeks New Ways to Ramp \nUp Arrests, The New York Times (June 13, 2025), https://perma.cc/E3RE-RK7S.  \n34 Hamed Aleaziz, Under Pressure From the White House, ICE Seeks New Ways to Ramp \nUp Arrests, The New York Times (June 13, 2025), https://perma.cc/E3RE-RK7S.  \n35 Adam Shaw, Trump border czar Tom Homan reveals ICE teams are already arresting \n‘public safety threats’, Fox News (Jan. 21, 2025), https://perma.cc/VW65-PPZ9.  \n  -33- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 34\nof 48\n160.

Mr. Ramirez, Ms. Dias, J.S.T., and G.R.R.’s experiences are not unique. \nThey reflect an unlawful practice that immigration officers rely on in their enforcement \noperations across the country and throughout Colorado: make warrantless arrests without \nthe requisite probable cause determinations regarding legal status and flight risk.  \n174.  For each Plaintiff, immigration agents never assessed anyone’s flight risk, \nnor did they obtain a warrant before making an arrest.  \n175.  These agents instead indiscriminately arrested people, including people \nwith pending immigration applications, no criminal history, established residences in the \ncommunity, steady employment, family in the United States, and other community ties \ncontradicting any purported flight risk. And agents targeted high-density locations like \napartment complexes and nightclubs where many Latine people lived or gathered but \nconducted no individualized analysis about their status or likelihood of escape. \n176.

ICE’s  Illegal  Practices  Have  Terrorized  the  Community  and  Sowed \nDistrust in Police \n177.  Because of ICE’s policy and practice of conducting unlawful warrantless \narrests, Plaintiffs and community members are terrified to leave their homes, afraid that \ngoing out in public could result in another ICE encounter. \n178.  Plaintiff G.R.R. feels nervous leaving his home and fears going to public \nplaces. He is afraid of law enforcement officers. Similarly, Plaintiff J.S.T. is afraid of going \nout in public. Ms. Dias also feels anxious when leaving home. Community members \nO.M.R. and J.P.P. experienced severe anxiety after their encounters with and warrantless \narrests by ICE. \n179.  Plaintiffs and community members also experienced physical injuries, pain, \nand hunger due to ICE’s unlawful arrests and the ensuing events. G.R.R.’s hand was cut \non the ground when an immigration agent violently pushed him to the ground while \narresting him. G.R.R. and Ms. Dias suffered the pain of tight shackles on their wrists and \nankles. All Plaintiffs received only poor-quality, sometimes spoiled food in inadequate \nportions while detained. Community member O.M.R. experienced pain from the sleeping \nconditions in the Aurora Detention Center, which J.P.P. described as “unbearable.” All \nPlaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, experienced emotional and dignitary harms \nbecause ICE targeted them for enforcement and arrest in violation of federal law. \n180.  Because  ICE  made  these  arrests  without  a  warrant,  Plaintiffs  and \ncommunity members live with the fear that they could be arrested and detained again at \nany time regardless of whether they are a flight risk. Each of the Plaintiffs lives, works, \ntravels, and socializes in communities where ICE agents have been active, and where \n  -38- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 39\nof 48\nICE has made repeat visits and unlawful warrantless arrests. ICE is making warrantless \narrests in the Front Range, the I-70 mountain corridor, and the Western Slope of people \nbased only on the type of their driver’s license without proper statutory inquiry. Given the \nAdministration’s stated objectives, and their systematic violation of § 1357(a)(2), the \nPlaintiffs and class members face high risk of additional unlawful arrests. \n181.  ICE’s actions have also stoked intense anxiety and fear of future harm \namong Plaintiffs, community members, and their families.  \n182.  Community members with young children are terrified of being swept up in \na raid and separated from their children. Plaintiff G.R.R.’s young son is acting out at \nschool, and G.R.R. constantly worries about being separated from his American-born son. \nJ.S.T.’s young niece, a U.S. citizen, fears being separated from her beloved uncle, who \nhas helped raise her.  \n183.  And Plaintiffs fear financial and economic repercussions from ICE’s actions. \nWhile detained, Plaintiffs were unable to work. J.S.T. lost his home; Mr. Ramirez and \nG.R.R. were unable to provide financially for their children and families. Ms. Dias lost one \nof her jobs and was forced to move back home – she has had to reduce her courseload \nat  college  due to financial  strain,  transportation  difficulties,  and ongoing  stress and \ntrauma.  \n184.  Elected  leaders  in  Colorado,  both  Democrats  and  Republicans,  have \nsounded the alarm about the widespread harmful effects of immigration enforcement by \nICE and other federal agency immigration practices. \n  -39- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 40\nof 48\n185.  Community leaders in Colorado are also raising concerns about ICE’s \ntactics. “‘The impact has been profound on families. The community has been put into a \nreally precarious position,’ said [Raquel] Lane-Arellano, from the Colorado Immigrant \nRights Coalition.”48 Residents in mountain towns in Colorado have high rates of suicide \nand substance abuse disorders, partially due to fluctuations in income, which can cause \nstress for the local workforce. Latine communities in these towns, who make up a large \nportion of the population, are particularly vulnerable. Yirka Díaz Platt, a bilingual social \nworker who resides in Silverthorne, Colorado, said “a pervasive fear of deportation has \ncaused many Latino workers and residents to retreat into the shadows. People are \ncancelling in-person meetings and avoid applying for government services that require \nsubmitting personal data, according to local health workers and advocates.”49 \n186.  ICE’s unlawful arrests have sent shockwaves of terror across the state of \nColorado, including in mountain towns, which traditionally have many migrant workers. \nVoces Unidas de las Montañas, a nonprofit focused on advocacy and policy on behalf of \nimmigrants, stated they have received over 100 phone calls or messages via their social \nmedia platforms or to their direct hotline from people who are on heightened alert because \n \n48  Seth  Klamann,  Immigration  arrests  in  Colorado  have  surged  under  the  Trump \nadministration.

Those are the conversations we’re \nhaving or we were having that week at an unprecedented level,” stated the CEO and \nPresident of Voces Unidas de las Montañas, Alex Sanchez. Id. Across the country \nincluding Colorado, immigrants are afraid and retreating into the shadows.51 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n187.  Individual Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of individuals who have been \nor will be subjected to the unlawful practices this lawsuit challenges: arrests regardless \nof probable cause of flight risk. \n188.  Plaintiffs Mr. Ramirez, Ms. Dias, J.S.T., and G.R.R. seek to represent a \nclass under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) consisting of: \nAll persons since January 20, 2025, who have been arrested or will \nbe arrested in this District by ICE without a warrant and without a \npre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the \nperson poses a flight risk. \n189.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(1) because it is sufficiently numerous as to make joinder impracticable. \nIn the first six months of this year, ICE data shows that its agents arrested almost 2,000 \n \n50 Spencer Wilson, Fear grips Colorado mountain towns amid rumors of increased patrols \nby  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement,  CBS  News  (June  5,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/84JZ-UG4T.  \n51 Catherine E. Scholchet, et al., ‘It’s like one day everyone left’: How immigration \ncrackdowns are reshaping America, CNN (Aug. 26, 2025), https://perma.cc/LP5F-HYKR.  \n  -41- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 42\nof 48\npeople in Colorado.52 At large-scale raids alone, upwards of 150 people have been swept \nup—most pursuant to collateral, warrantless arrests. ICE has publicly stated that it intends \nto continue making warrantless arrests regardless of an individual’s circumstances. \n190.  The proposed class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23(a)(2) because all members of the class are subject to ICE’s policies \nand practices regarding warrantless arrests, as well as the absence of policies relating to \nhow an agent should make a probable cause determination of unlawful status and flight \nrisk. There are questions of law and fact common to the class, including: \na.  Whether  ICE  has  a  policy,  pattern,  or  practice  of  conducting \nwarrantless arrests without proper probable cause including whether \nan individual is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for \nthe arrest; \nb.  Whether ICE’s policy, pattern, or practice of conducting warrantless \narrests  without  proper  probable  cause  including  whether  that \nindividual is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for the \narrest violates 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) and 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(ii). \n191.   The proposed class meets the typicality requirement of Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(a)(3). Individual Plaintiffs’ legal claims are typical to all members of the \nproposed class. Individual Plaintiffs have no interests separate from those of the class \n \n52 Sandra Fish, et al., Most people arrested by ICE in Colorado and Wyoming this year \ndid not have a criminal history, The Colorado Sun (July 18, 2025) (citing Deportation Data \nProject’s  compilation  of  ICE  data  on  immigration  arrests  in  Colorado) \nhttps://perma.cc/Z2Z7-423D. \n  -42- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 43\nof 48\nthey seek to represent and seek no relief other than the relief sought on behalf of the \nclass. Defendants have acted and intend to act in a manner adverse to the rights of the \nmembers of the class, making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate regarding \nthe class as a whole.  \n192.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(a)(4). Each putative class representative has committed to fairly and \nadequately representing the interests of the class. \n193.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  are  experienced  in  class  action,  civil  rights,  and \nimmigrants’ rights litigation. Plaintiffs’ counsel have the requisite level of expertise and \nresources to adequately prosecute this case on behalf of Plaintiffs and the proposed \nclass. Plaintiffs’ counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \n194.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \nthe class, so that final injunctive or declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class \nas  a  whole.  The  relief  requested  –  constraining  Defendants’  practice  of  effecting \nwarrantless arrests without making the probable cause determinations required by law –\nwill provide relief to the class as a whole.  \n195.  Plaintiffs Mr. Ramirez, Ms. Dias, J.S.T., and G.R.R. and the class have been \ndirectly injured by Defendants’ statutory and regulatory violations and are at risk of future \nharm from continuation of their acts and omissions in failing to adhere to their obligations \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) and 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(ii). \n196.  In United Farm Workers v. Noem, the Eastern District of California issued \nits April 29, 2025 Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Provisional Class Certification and \n  -43- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 44\nof 48\nGranting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction which issued a similar injunction for \nthe class proposed in this case.  785 F.Supp.3d 672, 742-3 (E.D. Cal. 2025).  The Court \nnoted that the government “shows a pattern and practice of warrantless arrests without \n[immigration] agents performing individualized flight risk assessments to have probable \ncause for the arrest as required.” Id. at 735. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) and 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706(2)(C): \n197.  Plaintiffs repeat, re-allege, and incorporate by reference each and every \nallegation in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth here. \n198.  Defendants arrested Plaintiffs Mr. Ramirez, Ms. Dias, J.S.T., and G.R.R. \nwithout  warrants.  Before  each  arrest,  Defendants  failed  to  make  the  required \nindividualized findings including flight risk. \n199.  Defendants made these arrests without a warrant and without “reason to \nbelieve” that Plaintiffs were “in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws” and “likely to \nescape before a warrant can be obtained for [their] arrest” in violation of 8 U.S.C. § \n1357(a)(2). These arrests were part of Defendants’ policy, pattern, and/or practice of \nusing warrantless arrests during sweeps of areas where people of Latine descent live, \nwork, drive, and gather. \n200.  Defendants  do  not  have  a  policy  or  practice  that  adequately  ensures \ncompliance  with  the  statutory  limits  of  ICE’s  warrantless  arrest  authority.  While \nDefendants did previously and nominally have guidance on how to make an individualized \ndetermination of both unlawful immigration status and likelihood of escape before a \nwarrant can be obtained, including through their now-rescinded Broadcast Statement of \n  -44- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 45\nof 48\nPolicy, Defendants now not only permit, but encourage their agents to make warrantless \narrests carte blanche in violation of law.  \n201.  Based on ICE’s public statements that it will continue making “unintended \narrests” in jurisdictions like Colorado, along with statements from “Border Czar” Tom \nHoman making clear that mass warrantless arrest operations are consistent with agency-\nwide policy, Defendants will continue to arrest individuals without regard to whether there \nis reason to believe both that the individuals are in the country illegally and are likely to \nescape before an arrest warrant can be obtained, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2). \n202.  Defendants’ policy, pattern, and/or practice of making warrantless arrests \nwithout the required individualized status determination and flight risk analysis is “final \nagency action” that is ultra vires and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations” under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2). 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706(2)(C). \n203.  Individual  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  have  no  plain,  adequate,  or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. The injunctive and \ndeclaratory  relief  sought  by  Plaintiffs  is  necessary  to  prevent  continued  and  future \nirreparable injury. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(ii) and 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706(2)(C): \n \n204.  Plaintiffs repeat, re-allege, and incorporate by reference each and every \nallegation in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth here. \n205.  Defendants arrested Plaintiffs Mr. Ramirez, Ms. Dias, J.S.T., and G.R.R., \nwithout  warrants.  Before  each  arrest,  Defendants  failed  to  make  the  required \nindividualized findings including flight risk. \n  -45- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 46\nof 48\n206.  Defendants made these arrests without a warrant and without “reason to \nbelieve” that Plaintiffs were “likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for [their] \narrest” in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(ii). These arrests were part of Defendants’ \npolicy, pattern, and/or practice of using warrantless arrests during sweeps of areas where \npeople of Latine descent live, work, drive, and gather. \n207.  Defendants do not have a policy or practice for ensuring compliance with \nthe statutory limits of ICE’s warrantless arrest authority and do not provide any meaningful \nguidance to ICE personnel on how to make an individualized determination of both \nimmigration status or likelihood of escape before a warrant can be obtained. Defendants \npermit their agents to make warrantless arrests carte blanche in violation of law.  \n208.  Based on ICE’s public statements that it will continue making “unintended \narrests” in jurisdictions like Colorado, along with statements from “Border Czar” Tom \nHoman making clear that mass warrantless arrest operations are consistent with agency-\nwide policy, Defendants will continue to arrest individuals without regard to whether there \nis a reason to believe both that the individuals are in the country unlawfully and likely to \nescape before an arrest warrant can be obtained, in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(ii). \n209.  Defendants’ policy, pattern, and/or practice of making warrantless arrests \nwithout the required individualized status determination and flight risk analysis is “final \nagency action” that is ultra vires and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations” under 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(ii). 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706(2)(C). \n210.  Individual  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  have  no  plain,  adequate,  or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. The injunctive and \n  -46- \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-03183-RBJ     Document 1     filed 10/09/25     USDC Colorado     pg 47\nof 48\ndeclaratory  relief  sought  by  Plaintiffs  is  necessary  to  prevent  continued  and  future \nirreparable injury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:  \n1.   Assume jurisdiction over this matter;  \n2.   Certify  this  action  as  a  class  action  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2);  \n3.   Appoint the undersigned counsel as class counsel pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23(g);  \n4.   Declare under 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) that Defendants’ actions violate the \nrights of Plaintiffs and the Class under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2), 8 C.F.R. \n§ 287.8(c)(2)(ii), and 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); \n5.   Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining further violations of \nPlaintiffs’ and the Class’s rights under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) and 8 C.F.R. \n§ 287.8(c)(2)(ii);  \n6.
