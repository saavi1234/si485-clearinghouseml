Following its investigation, the DOJ issued its findings letter on September 12, 1988.  The findings letter detailed the unconstitutional conditions revealed by the investigation, which included Los Lunas' failure (1) to provide minimally adequate training programs sufficient to ensure that residents were free from undue bodily and chemical restraints, (2) to provide minimally adequate medical staff and medical care and (3) to provide minimally adequate resident supervision to protect residents from unreasonable risks to their health and safety.</p><p>On October 27 . 1989, the DOJ filed a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA in United States District Court for the District of New Mexico regarding the conditions at the Los Lunas Hospital and Training School, Los Lunas, New Mexico.  The case was settled shortly thereafter.  A formal Settlement Agreement was signed and entered as a formal order of the District Court on February 1, 1988. The Agreement called for implementation of various reforms at Los Lunas. The implementation period followed with the parties filing quarterly compliance reports thereafter until 1997.</p><p>On September 22, 1997, the District Court (Judge James A. Parker) granted the parties' joint motion to terminate consent decree and dismiss case.</p><p></p>",

N.M.\nAEP:VH:PSL:pmw MR NM-002-001\nDJ  168-49-7\nSubject Date\nRecommendation to Investigate JAN  I 3 I987\nLos Lunas Hospital and Training\nSchool, Los Lunas, New Mexico\nTo From\nWm. Bradford Reynolds Arthur E. Peabody, Jr.\nAssistant Attorney General Chief\nCivil Rights Division Special Litigation Section\nIntroduction\nPursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons\nAct,  (CRIPA) 42 U.S.C. §1997-1997j, we recommend initiation of\nan investigation into conditions of confinement at the Los\nLunas Hospital and Training School in Los Lunas, New Mexico.\nThe information which we have compiled indicates a pattern or\npractice of egregious or flagrant conditions which violate the\nconstitutional rights of the persons residing at Los Lunas.\nThese practices include inadequate medical care, misuse\nof medications, abuse of residents, neglect of residents,\nimproper food services, inadequate numbers of qualified staff,\nsubstandard physical conditions and the denial of minimally\nadequate training required by Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307\n(1982).  These practices continue at Los Lunas despite the fact\nthat the Health Care Financing Administration certified Los\nLunas in October, 1986. JL/ However, certification came after\nthe institution failed to meet HCFA standards following two\nprior inspections. 2/\nBackground 3_/\nThe Los Lunas State Hospital was established in 1925 by\nthe New Mexico State Legislature to care for \"mental defectives\"\nand received its first patient in 1929.  In 1955 the legislature\nXT  Albuquerque Journal, Oct. 30, 1986 at A3.  Although HCFA\ncertification might be considered prima facie evidence of a\nfacility's adequacy, certification does not conclusively determine\nwhether a facility meets all constitutional standards. See,\nWoe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96 (2nd Cir. 1984), cert, denied, 105 S.\nCt. 339 (1984).\n2/  Albuquerque Journal, Oct. 30, 1986 at A3.\n3/  Ij3. All the information in the Background section comes\nfrom this source.\n\n- 2 -\nexpanded the scope of the hospital's responsibilities by adding\na training school for \"trainable mental defectives.\" In the\nsame session, the hospital was also opened to those who were\nbedridden and needed 24-hour supervision and care.  Currently,\nthe facility serves approximately 350 severely mentally retarded\nand physically handicapped patients.  The hospital has about\n650 employees.\ni\nSources of Information\nWe have obtained our information from various sources\nincluding an Executive Summary of a Task Force Report compiled\nby the New Mexico Health and Environment Department  (HED), the\nAlbuquerque Office of Protection and Advocacy  (P and A), a\nseries of local newspaper articles, telephone interviews with a\nformer Protection and Advocacy attorney, Betsy Church, a former\nLos Lunas Special Education Director, Paul Wirth and a professor\nat the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, Ruth Luckasson.\nVarious other local attorneys were also contacted.\nFactual Allegations\nThe information we obtained  indicates that numerous\ndeficiencies exist throughout the Los Lunas Hospital and Training\nSchool.  Recently, Los Lunas was the defendant in a New Mexico\nstate court lawsuit brought by local attorneys on behalf of\n45 residents of one cottage at the facility in which two deaths\nand one rape occurred in September, 1986.  On October 29, 1986\na New Mexico District Court Judge, following three days of\nclosed-door testimony, ruled that Los Lunas has failed to\nproperly care for its residents. 4/  Valencia County District\nCourt Judge Tibo Chavez ruled Los Lunas has failed \"to provide\nthe level of medical care required by law and some patients\nhave been abused and neglected.\" 5/  Following the ruling Judge\nChavez forbade any of the attorneys or Los Lunas staff members\ninvolved to reveal specifics about the testimony. 6/\nThe hearing which produced the ruling followed a series of\nincidents, including the rape and death of a 19-year-old female\nresident in September. ]_/ Hospital administrators, members of\n4/Id.  at p. 1.\n6/  October 30, 1986 telephone conversation with P and A attorney\nAnn Harvey.\n7/  Albuquerque Journal, Oct. 30, 1986 at p. 1.\n\n- 3 -\nthe medical staff, at least five other hospital employees and\nparents of residents of Los Lunas testified at the hearing. 8/\nJudge Chavez ordered increased security at the hospital, independent\nmedical examinations for residents to screen for abuse and\nrequired Los Lunas staff to notify a resident's attorney of any\nabuse reports. 9/  Despite the fact that Judge Chavez's order appears\nto be in the best interest of Los Lunas residents, HED is bitterly\nopposing entry of the order.  Following the hearing, HED asked the\nNew Mexico Supreme Court for a Writ of Prohibition, challenging the\nDistrict Court's jurisdiction to enter the order.  On December 10,\n1986 the Supreme Court denied HED's request. 10/\nThe next day, December 11, 1986, HED filed notice with the\nstate appellate court that it will formally appeal the Chavez\nruling. JL_1/  While the appeal process continues, HED refuses to\nproceed with medical tests to determine whether residents have\nsufffered any mental, physical or sexual abuse. \\2J  Local\nattorneys expect the appeal process to take over a year, 13/\nduring which time the Chavez order is automatically stayed and\nLos Lunas residents will be subjected to continuing deprivations\nof their constitutional rights.\nThus, the fact that a New Mexico state court judge has\nsought to alter certain procedures at Los Lunas should not\npreclude a CRIPA investigation for several reasons.  First, the\nChavez order is limited in its scope.  The order does nothing\nto address problems of inadequate medical care, misuse of\nmedication, improper food services, inadequate numbers of\nqualified staff, substandard physical conditions, and the denial\nof Youngberg training. L4_/  Second, the order pertains to only 45\nLos Lunas residents, all of whom reside at the same cottage.  The\norder does not pertain to the majority of Los Lunas patients.  Over\n8/  :id.\n9/  Harvey interview.\n10/ Albuquerque Journal, Dec. 11, 1986 at p. 1.\n11/ Albuquerque Journal, Dec. 12, 1986.\nV2/ Id.\n13/ id.\n14/ See infra pps. 4-10 and accompanying notes.\n\n- 4 -\n300 residents are excluded from the protection offered by the Chavez\norder.  Third, as noted earlier, the appeal process is expected\nto take over a year and there is, of course, no guarantee that\nthe Chavez order will survive appeal.  Fourth, the state has shown\nits animosity toward instituting any of the reforms covered in\nthe Chavez order by opposing entry of the order and refusing to\nproceed on its own with matters suggested by the Chavez order,\nsuch as the independent medical examinations to screen for\nabuse.  Finally, our sources have stated that there is some question\nas to whether the court order would be fully and effectively\nimplemented and whether there would be sufficient local resources\navailable to be continually seeking enforcement of the Chavez\norder.  15/\nThe abuse, neglect and lack of proper medical care cited\nby Judge Chavez as well as the existance of other conditions at\nLos Lunas, including the lack of minimally adequate training\nrequired by Youngberg, deprive Los Lunas residents of their\nconstitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. 16/\nI.  Abuse\nLos Lunas residents are being subjected to physical and\nsexual abuse from staff and fellow residents.  Judge Chavez, in\nhis October 29, 1986 ruling said, \"I have found that Mark\nDelgado, the director of the institution, has instituted reforms\nwhich will correct deficiencies.  Not withstanding the tightening\nof the procedures, I also found there has been abuse and neglect\nof certain residents.\" 17/\n15/ Telephone interviews conducted with Betsy Church, December 2,\n1986 and Ruth Luckasson, December 15, 1986.\n16/  See, Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  Youngberg held\nthe Fourteenth Amendment's liberty interest protects the right\nto reasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from\nunreasonable bodily restraints and such minimally adequate\ntraining as reasonably may be required by these interests.\n17/ Albuquerque Journal, Oct. 30, 1986 at p. 1.\n\n- 5 -\nJudge Chavez's ruling came on the heels of two deaths at\nthe hospital.  As noted earlier, a 19-year-old female resident\ndied September 26, 1986.  She had been raped two days earlier\nand died as a result of internal wounds. ^8/  A 27-year-old\nmale patient died at the facility the same day the woman died,\nSeptember 26, 1986, when he choked to death. 19_/ The New Mexico\nState Police, the Valencia County District Attorney's Office\nand the New Mexico Health and Environment Department are investi-\ngating the deaths, but no charges have yet been filed. 20/\nThere have been six other deaths at the hospital before\nthose in September and three of those deaths occurred at the\nsame cottage  (Bashein) as did the September deaths. Zl/  One\nother patient at the cottage received head wounds and three\nothers received puncture wounds in August and early September. 22/\nMs. Luckasson described Los Lunas as a \"terrible, vindictive\nplace.\" 22./ Many Los Lunas patients who require a blended diet\nare often fed simply ground-up garbage by the kitchen staff. 24/\nStaff will feed patients \"by filling their mouths with mush,\nthrowing a towel over their faces and holding their heads back.\" 25/\nThe tremendous danger such a feeding procedure possesses to medically\nfragile or immobile patients who experience difficulty in chewing\nand swallowing  is obvious.  This feeding procedure is medically\nunacceptable for the type of patients residing at Los Lunas.\n18/ Id. at A3.\n19/ Id.\n20/ Albuquerque Journal, Oct. 30, 1986 and Harvey interview.\n11/  IS*.\n22/ id.\n23/ Luckasson interviews.\n2±/ Id.\n25/ Id.\n\n- 6 -\nLos Lunas residents are also denied prompt and appropriate\nmedical care due to the callousness of staff physicians.  In one\ninstance, a patient had slipped and fallen, knocking out several\nof his front teeth.  The patient was taken to the staff doctor\nwho said the patient \"doesn't need those teeth.  Anyway, mentally\nretarded people don't feel anything.\" 2j>/  The patient went\nunattended all day and. at the evening meal was fed hot cereal,\ncausing the patient to' begin screaming in pain.  A university\nstudent working part-time at the hospital eventually took the\npatient in the student's own car to a local doctor. 27/\nThe September rape and death of the 19-year-old woman drew\na good deal of local media attention.  However, many more rapes\ntake place at the facility than ever draw notice. 2%_/ The\nattitude of the staff is to \"look the other way\" when it comes\nto client-on-client rape or homosexual rape. 29/\nMs. Church told a Section attorney that Los Lunas residents are\n\"definitely being abused.\" y§J  She said one resident, George Chavez,\nwho is afflicted with Parkinson's Disease, has been \"abused and\nbeaten\" by the staff in the year he has been there. _3J./ Another\ninstance involved the parents of one resident who became concerned\nthat their child was being overmedicated and possibly sexually\nabused.  The boy had been transferred to Los Lunas from a boys'\nhome where he was being sexually abused.  For a time the boy's\nbehavioral problems abated but resurfaced later indicating a\nrecurrence of abuse.  The boy developed patterns of rectal\nbleeding, indicating he was again being sexually abused. 32/\n26/ II.\n11/ Id.\n28/ ld_.\n29/ Id.\n30/ Church interview.\n3_1/ Id.\n32/ Id.\n\n- 7 -\nNot only are Los Lunas residents being physically and\nsexually abused but patients are often simply neglected by\nstaff.  One summer day several non-ambulatory patients\nwere discovered sitting on the concrete outside one of the\ncottages.  Besides being on the hot concrete, the patients were\n\"covered with flies.\" 33/\n,  II.  Staffing\nLos Lunas has an inadequate number of trained and qualified\nstaff to provide the proper levels of care and services to\nhospital residents.  The HED Task Force noted staffing shortages\nin several areas of the institution. _3_i/  Tne  Report's Executive\nSummary states the shortage \"was determined to be especially\nacute in the direct care areas where the turnover rate is very\nhigh, salaries are low, absenteeism  is high, and there is an\nexcessive amount of overtime work and double shifting.\" 35/\nThe Summary also notes staff shortages in Psychological Services,\nin the Housekeeping and Dietary Departments and cites \"[s]evere\nproblems of recruitment and retention in professional specialities\nsuch as Physical Therapy. J36/  The Task Force also determined\nstaff training at all levels to be of inadequate quality and\nquantity. 37/\nMs. Church described Los Lunas as having an \"incredible\nstaff shortage.\" 3JL/  This shortage results in a variety of\ndangerous conditions to patient health and well-being.  Staff\nwill often feed patients too quickly in order to feed all\n33/ Luckasson interview.\n34/ The Los Lunas Task Force was appointed during the first\nweek of October, 1984 by former HED Secretary Joseph Goldberg.\nThe nine-member Task Force issued its Report December 12, 1984.\nThe Special Litigation Section received a copy of the Report\nfrom an attorney at the Albuquerque Protection and Advocacy Office\nI5/ Id.\n21/ id.\n38/ Church interview.\n\n- 8 -\npatients within a given time, thus exposing medically fragile\npatients to the unacceptable risks involved in not having\nsufficient time to intake and digest food. 39/\nThe lack of training for staff at Los Lunas also leads to\nan overuse of undue bodily restraints which is caused primarily\nby the lack of a qualified staff.  The staff is also insufficient\nto provide basic care.  For example, there is a \"severe lack\" of\nphysical therapists at the facility. A0_/ Bed-ridden patients will\noften develop painful contractures and will lose use of limbs\nbecause \"there is no one to train the staff in what to do with\nbed-ridden patients.\" £1/  As a probable result of an under-trained\nstaff, two mentally retarded men were mistakenly served oven\ncleaner instead of fruit juice in October, 1985. 42/\nThe lack of staff numbers has also created unsanitary\nconditions at the facility.  Los Lunas has been described as\na facility where the \"whole place reaks of urine and patients\nare frequently lying around in dirty diapers.\" 4_3_/  Thus, the\nlack of adequately trained staff poses an ongoing and continuous\ndanger to the health and safety of Los Lunas residents.\nIll.  Medications\nPatients at Los Lunas are improperly and overly medicated.\nThe approach to medication is a \"shotgun method.\" £4/  Ms. Church\nstated that staff will \"try a little of this and a little of that;\nsome Valium, some Thorazine.\" 4_5/  Thus, there is a substantial\nquestion whether medication is being prescribed and monitored\nconsistent with the exercise of professional judgment.\n£0/ Id.\n_41/ Id.\n42/ United Press Internal, October 8, 1985.  Southwest Regional\nNews Briefs.  An Albuquerque private attorney, Lynn Eby,\nrepresents the two patients fed the oven cleaner and expects to\nbring a suit on their behalf in the near future.\n43/ Church interview.\n44/ ^d.\n45/ Id.\n\n- 9 -\nThe heavy use of drugs at Los Lunas is in lieu of training\nand is done strictly \"for the convenience of the staff.  What\nyou have is basically a bunch of drugged people sleeping all\nday.\" 4_6/  Numerous parents have approached the Protection and\nAdvocacy Office concerned about the effects drugs were having\non their children.  Cases of Tardive Dyskinesia, the result of\nan over-use of psychot,ropic drugs, also exist at the facility. 47/\nThe medication review procedure is also abused at Los Lunas.\nStaff physicians are supposed to review patient medication every\n30 days.  However, these reviews often amount only to a nurse\nrewriting an order and a doctor initialing the order or the\nnurse forging the doctor's initials. 48/\nIV.  Training\nLos Lunas residents are not provided sufficient training\nto protect their Youngberg established rights to the minimal\ntraining necessary to ensure a reasonably safe environment and freedom\nfrom undue bodily restraint.  Mr. Luckasson told Section personnel\nthat there was no programming to deal with the behavioral or\nemotional problems of the mentally retarded. 49/  For example,\nthere is nothing done to assist residents witTT~problems such as\nsleep disorders and thus a patient's health will deteriorate. 50/\nMs. Church stated that there was \"absolutely no training going\non.\"  ^1/  Paul Wirth, a former director of education at Los\nLunas, agreed with our other sources that the lack of training for\nthe residents directly contributed to the use of undue bodily\nrestraints and created conditions posing undue risks to the physical\nsafety of residents. 52/\n47/ Id.\n48/ Church interview and Luckasson interview.\n49/ Luckasson interview.\n50/ Id.\n51/ Church interview.\n52/ Telephone interview with Paul Wirth conducted December 3, 1986,\nMr. Wirth resigned from Los Lunas in July, 1985.  He has worked\nthere for three and one-half years prior to his resignation.\n\n- 10 -\nWirth stated that, during his tenure, the most training any\nLos Lunas resident received was during the daytime hours of the\nfacility's 190-day school year for those residents under 21 years\nof age. 53/  However, nothing is done for any resident after school\nhours. 547  There are no programs and no activities for the residents\nafter school hours. J_5/  Compounding these problems is again the\nlack of adequately trained staff and the lack of any coordinated\nefforts between teachers and direct care staff. 56/\ni\nThus, the lack of training afforded Los Lunas residents\nviolates their rights established  in Youngberg by not providing\nthe minimal training necessary to ensure a reasonably safe\nenvironment and freedom from undue bodily restraints.\nConclusion\nConditions at Los Lunas Hospital and Training Center subject\nresidents to deprivations which violate their Constitutional\nrights under Youngberg.  We believe that the facts stated above\nshow a facility which poses a substantial risk to the safety of\nits residents, and justifies an investigation of the facility.\nTherefore, we recommend that an investigation of Los Lunas be\ninstituted under our CRIPA authority.\nAccordingly, we have attached for your signature the\nappropriate letters notifying state and federal officials of\nour inteqrt«d investigation.\nApproved:  ( ,\nDisapproved:\nComments:",

      "text": "U.S. v. N.M.  U.S. Departmen  . Justice\nII III IIIII ill II\nMR-NM-002-003\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney  General  Washington, D.C.  20530\nG(\\) r, n  SEP-\nHonorable Garrey Carruthers  / U  O^\nGovernor\nState of New Mexico\nState Capitol Building\nSanta Fe, New Mexico  87504\nRe:  Notice of Findings Regarding the Los Lunas Hospital\nand Training School. 42 U.S.C. Section 1997b(aWl)\nDear Governor Carruthers:\nOn January 21, 1987, we informed you that, pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Person Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C.\nSection 1997, we were commencing an investigation into\nconditions at the Los Lunas Hospital and Training School (Los\nLunas) in Los Lunas, New Mexico.  As contemplated by the statute,\nwe are writing to inform you of the findings of our investigation\nand of the remedial measures required to remedy the\nunconstitutional conditions at Los Lunas.\nDuring our investigation of Los Lunas, Special Litigation\nSection attorneys conducted tours of Los Lunas with three private\nconsultants.  Our consultants examined resident records,\ninterviewed the facility superintendent and numerous staff\nmembers and spoke with residents.  We also reviewed numerous\ndocuments provided by the facility, concerning a wide range of\nprocedures and activities.  During our investigation we were\ntreated graciously by Los Lunas staff and attorneys from the\nHealth and Environment Department and from the Attorney General's\nOffice.\nOur extensive investigation reveals that conditions exist at\nLos Lunas which deprive residents of their constitutional rights.\nInstitutionalized mentally retarded persons have a constitutional\nright to adequate medical care and such training as an\nappropriate professional would consider reasonable to ensure\ntheir freedom from undue risks to personal safety and\nunreasonable bodily restraints.  Younaberg v. Romeo. 457 U.S.\n307, 324  (1982).\n\n- 2 -\nSet out below are our findings and recommendations.  The\nunconstitutional conditions revealed by our investigation include\nLos Lunas' failure to provide minimally adequate training\nprograms sufficient to ensure residents are free from undue\nbodily and chemical restraints, failure to provide minimally\nadequate medical -staff and medical care and failure to provide\nminimally adequate resident supervision to protect residents from\nunreasonable risks to their health and safety.\nINADEQUATE TRAINING PROGRAMS\nLos Lunas fails to provide professionally designed and\nimplemented training programs sufficient to ensure that residents\nare not subjected to unreasonable bodily restraints.  Following a\ncareful review, our consultant psychologist concluded that Los\nLunas staff are using physical restraints, isolation and\npunishment (e.g., forced inhalation of ammonia) to control the\nbehavior of residents in lieu of necessary training programs.\nLos Lunas staff do not identify and eliminate circumstances\nwhich provoke problem behaviors in residents.  Staff intervene\nonly after the onset of a maladaptive episode by restraining the\nresident.  Our consultant noted that certain procedures used in\nrestraining residents are substantial departures from accepted\nprofessional practice.  Specifically, the use of \"papoose boards\"\nas restraint devices are commonplace at Los Lunas;\nstraightjackets and ammonia inhalants are used as a consequence\nfor antisocial behavior.  Restrained individuals are in some\ncases isolated in a room with a closed door out of sight of\nstaff.  This practice, absent adequate surveillance, places\nseverely handicapped residents at great risk of injury and is not\nprofessionally justifiable.\nFurther, the use of restraint on individual residents is\ncontinued for unacceptable periods of time without any monitoring\nof the restraint.  The lack of appropriate monitoring is the\nresult of insufficient tracking and recordkeeping procedures.\nLos Lunas lacks an effective system to evaluate the use of\nrestraints, the need for, or the need to, modify a training\nprogram.\nFinally, Los Lunas lacks a data gathering system necessary\nto provide information upon which professional decisions can be\nbased regarding all aspects of training for residents who\nrequire training programs.\nINADEQUATE MEDICAL STAFFING\nLos Lunas does not have adequate nursing, physical therapy\nor occupational therapy staff to adequately meet the needs of\nLos Lunas residents or to provide sufficient supervision of\nresidents to ensure their safety.\n\n- 3 -\nThe number of nursing staff at Los Lunas is inadequate to\nmeet the heavy demands placed upon them.  For example, there is\nonly one nurse on the night shift responsible for providing\nnursing coverage for 18 cottages.  This nursing coverage .is\nunacceptable for -the type of resident population at Los Lunas.\nHaving only one nurse at night exposes residents to unreasonable\nrisks to their health and safety because the signs of incipient\n-illness which may not be noticed by non-nursing staff and hence\nmay not be reported to a physician in a timely fashion.\nPartially as a result of the lack of adequate staff, the\nsafety and security of residents has not always been maintained.\nThe most flagrant case is that of a woman who was raped,\ndeveloped peritonitis and died.  Improved resident supervision\nmay have prevented both the abuse and the subsequent delay in\nrecognizing the developing peritonitis.\nPatient safety is also compromised by staffing patterns\nwhich expose residents to unreasonable risks.  For example,\nduring a visit to Bashein Cottage prior to breakfast, our\nconsultants observed 32 wheelchair bound, profoundly retarded,\nmultiply-handicapped residents lined up in two groups of 16 in\nthe hallway outside the eating area without any staff member in\nvisual contact. Given the constant risk of seizures and other\nproblems generated by medical conditions exhibited by these\nresidents, such a practice places clients at an extreme risk to\ntheir health and safety.  Again, the need for improved resident\nsuperversion is heightened by the large number of\nmultiply-handicapped and physically and medically fragile\nresidents at Los Lunas.\nThe physical therapy and occupational therapy staffs at Los\nLunas consist of one person each.  These individuals are unable\nto meet the health related needs of residents.  Physical therapy\nis necessary at Los Lunas, especially in light of the large\nnumber of body deformities present among the resident population,\nin order to prevent muscular or skeletal breakdown.  Occupational\ntherapy is necessary to assist residents with eating disorders.\nThe two individuals currently assigned to physical and\noccupational therapy duties are spending the majority of their\ntime on wheelchair maintenance rather than resident care.\nFinally, the ability of Los Lunas to deliver adequate\nmedical care to its residents is hindered by inadequate\nrecordkeeping practices at the facility.  A resident's diagnosis\nand reasons why certain procedures and medications are proscribed\nare seldom written into a resident's record.  When changes are\nmade, there is little indication in the record as to the reasons\nfor such a change.  The medical section of a resident's record\nshould reflect this information.  Without such information,\nprofessional medical decisions can not be made.\n\n- 4 -\nINADEQUATE PSYCHIATRIC CARE\nThe administration of psychotropic medications at Los Lunas\nis_ not sufficiently monitored to protect resident from se'rious\nrisks to their health from the overuse of these medications.\nNumerous residents of Los Lunas have received neuroleptic or\npsychotropic medications, for years in some instances, absent\nadequate monitoring.\nIn addition, while dosages are often increased in an\nattempt to control maladaptive behaviors, there are often no\nsimilar attempts to decrease medications nor is there a\ndemonstration in the record to support the increased dosages.\nFurther, the records lacked evidence that such drugs are used in\nconjunction with a training program.\nMINIMALLY NECESSARY REMEDIES\nThe administration and staff at Los Lunas appear committed\nto providing residents with appropriate care, however the unique\npopulation of Los Lunas, combined with deficiencies in behavior\nmanagement, medical staffing and psychiatric practices have\nresulted in the creation of an environment which is violative of\nthe constitutional rights of Los Lunas residents.  The above-\nnoted conditions and deficiencies are both egregious and\nflagrant and are pursuant to a pattern or practice which is\ncausing Los Lunas residents grievous harm.\nTo rectify the deficiencies at Los Lunas and ensure that\nconstitutionally adequate conditions are maintained thereafter,\nthe following measures, at a minimum, must be undertaken. The\nState is free, of course, to implement measures beyond those\nlisted below.\n1)  Design and implement training programs in order to\neliminate the use of undue bodily and chemical restraints.  Such\nprocedures must include improvements in the current tracking and\nrecordkeeping systems to monitor the effectiveness of behavior\nmanagement programs and allow programs to be re-evaluated, as\nappropriate.\n2)  Increase nursing staff in order to provide adequate\nresident supervision and detect illness among the resident\npopulation.\n3)  Increase physical and occupational therapy staff to\nensure that residents are not at risk from muscular or skeletal\nbreakdown or eating disorders, and associated risks to their\nhealth and safety.\n\n- 5 -\n4)  Develop and implement side-effect monitoring procedures\nfor residents on neuroleptic and psychotropic medication to\neliminate undue risks of harm due to medication side effects.\n-  We are -willing to make our experts available to the State of\nNew Mexico to provide technical assistance in remedying the\ndeficiencies we have identified.  Information about federal\nfinancial assistance which may be available to assist with the\nremediation process can be obtained through the United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Regional Office and\nthrough the United States Department of Education by contacting\nthe individuals listed in the attached information guide.\nOur attorneys will be contacting counsel for the State of\nNew Mexico shortly to arrange a meeting to discuss this matter in\ngreater detail.  To date, we have been able to conduct this\ninvestigation in the spirit of cooperation intended by the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act, and look forward to\ncontinuing to work in the same manner with state officials in\nthat spirit toward an amicable resolution of this matter.\nSincerely\nWm.
