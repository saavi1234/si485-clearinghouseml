Mohawk Valley, Binghamton and Hutchings, as psychiatric\ncenters, are not currently staffed or otherwise prepared to\nprovide services, programs or training to persons with mental\nretardation.\n4.  Once plaintiffs were admitted to state custody, the\ndefendants obligated themselves to protect their constitutional\nand other rights.\n5.  Plaintiffs do not seek to compel the defendants to exer-\ncise their discretion in a particular way.  Plaintiffs seek\nrelief mandating that defendants implement the judgment of their\nown professionals with regard to the plaintiff class.  Plaintiffs\nseek injunctive relief mandating that the defendants provide\nplaintiffs with care, treatment and training suitable for persons\nwith mental retardation, either in a facility for persons with\nmental retardation or by providing appropriate services at the\npsychiatric center.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n6.  The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. §1331, 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. §1391(b), the venue for this action lies in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of New York\n-2-\n\nbecause the claims arose there and it is the judicial district\nwhere all the defendants reside.\n7.  Plaintiffs have joined pendent claims under state law\narising  from the same factual situation.  Plaintiffs  invite\ndefendants not to assert any Eleventh Amendment privilege, if\nany exists, so as to resolve all issues between the parties in\nthis action and to avoid duplicative actions in federal and state\ncourts.\nPARTIES\n8.  Plaintiff, John R. is 32 years old and was admitted\nto Binghamton Psychiatric Center  in September, 1978.  He is\ndisabled by reason of moderate mental retardation with behavioral\nsymptoms.  He brings this action by Bonnie H. Shoultz as guardian\nad litem.  John R. brings this action anonymously to avoid\ninvasion of his privacy.  His true name will be filed under seal\nwith this Court.\n9.  Plaintiff John S. is 56 years old and was admitted to\nMohawk Valley Psychiatric Center in 1971.  John S. has been a\nresident of state psychiatric centers since 1954 when he was\nadmitted to Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center.  John S. has been\n\"dually diagnosed\" with schizophrenia as his primary mental\nimpairment, with a secondary diagnosis of moderate mental retar-\ndation.  He brings this action by Bonnie H. Shoultz as guardian\nad litem.  John S. brings this action anonymously to avoid\n-3-\n\ninvasion of his privacy.  His true name will be filed under seal\nwith this Court.\n10.  Plaintiff Patricia R. is 33 years old and was first\nadmitted  to Hutchings Psychiatric Center  in 1975.  Patricia R.\nhas been \"dually diagnosed\" with schizophrenia and mild mental\nretardation.  She brings this action by her sister, Mary Alice B.\nPatricia R. brings this action anonymously to avoid invasion of\nher privacy.  Her true name will be filed under seal with this\nCourt.\n11.  Bonnie H. Shoultz serves herein as guardian ad litem to\nplaintiffs, John S. and John R.  These plaintiffs are moderately\nmentally retarded and are not capable of making  informed deci-\nsions with regard to their care or treatment or prosecution of\nlegal claims.  John S. does not have parents or other relatives\nactively supervising or participating  in decisions being made\nconcerning his care or treatment.  John R.'s mother  is also\ndisabled by reason of mental retardation and, therefore, a\nguardian ad litem is necessary to adequately protect John R.'s\ninterests in this action.\n12.  Defendant Mario Cuomo, the Governor of the State of New\nYork, is sued here in his official capacity.  Governor Cuomo has\noverall responsibility to ensure that the agencies of the execu-\ntive department of the New York State government, including the\nOffice of Mental Health and the Office of Mental Retardation and\n-4-\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities, act in full compliance with the New\nYork and United States Constitutions, the laws of New York, and\nagency regulations.  Specifically, Governor Cuomo has the overall\nresponsibility to ensure that all persons in \"state-custody\" are\nsafe and receive care, treatment, programs and services suited to\ntheir individual needs as recommended by defendants' pro-\nfessionals and as required by state law and regulations.\n13.  Defendant Richard C. Surles, the Commissioner of New\nYork State Office of Mental Health (OMH) is sued here in his\nofficial capacity.  Commissioner Surles is the chief  executive\nofficer responsible for the overall operation of the Mohawk\nValley, Binghamton and Hutchings Psychiatric Centers, and for\nensuring that all residents of these facilities/ including plain-\ntiffs, are safe, and receive care, treatment, programs and ser-\nvices suited to their individual needs as recommended by\ndefendants' professionals and as required by state law and regu-\nlations.\n14.  Defendant Elin Howe, the Commissioner of the New York\nState Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities\n(\"OMRDD\"), is sued here in her official capacity.  Commissioner\nHowe is the chief executive officer responsible for ensuring that\nplaintiffs, who are persons with mental retardation in state\ncustody, are safe and receive care, treatment, programs and ser-\nvices suited to their individual needs as recommended by defen-\n-5-\n\ndants' professionals and as required by state laws and\nregulations.\n15.  Commissioners, Surles and Howe, pursuant  to New York\nState Mental Hygiene Law, its implementing  regulations, and a\ncooperative agreement between OMH and OMRDD, are authorized and\nexpected to work together to ensure that the care, treatment,\nprograms and services provided by the State's psychiatric  centers\nto plaintiffs are planned, developed and implemented comprehen-\nsively, that gaps in services to the multiply disabled are elimi-\nnated, and that no plaintiff  is denied treatment and services\nj\nbecause he or she suffers from more than one disability.  N.Y.  '\nMental Hygiene Law §5.05(b).\n16.  Defendant Richard M. Heath, the Director of Mohawk\nValley Psychiatric Center,defendant Dwight Rhodes, the Director\nof Binghamton Psychiatric Center, and John R. Scott, the Director\nof Hutchings Psychiatric Center, are sued here in their official\ncapacity.  Richard M. Heath is the chief executive officer\nresponsible for the operation of Mohawk Valley Psychiatric\nCenter, Dwight Rhodes is the chief executive officer  responsible\nfor the operation of Binghamton Psychiatric Center, and John R.\nScott is the chief executive officer responsible for the\noperation of Hutchings Psychiatric Center.  Specifically, Mssrs.\nHeath, Rhodes, and Scott have the duty to ensure that all plain-\ntiffs are safe, and receive care, treatment, programs and ser-\n-6-\n\nvices suited to their  individual needs as recommended by\ndefendants' professionals and as required by federal and state\nlaw and regulations.\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS\n17.  Plaintiffs John S.   John R. and Patricia R. bring this\n#\naction on their own behalf and as a class action pursuant to Rule\n23(a) and 23 (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n18.  The Plaintiff class consists of all current and future\npatients at Mohawk Valley Psychiatric Center, Binghamton\nPsychiatric Center, and Hutchings Psychiatric Center who are men-\ntally retarded, and/or diagnosed as mentally retarded, and/or who\nhave been regarded as mentally retarded, and (a) who never have\nbeen evaluated by defendants' professional staff to determine\nwhether they require treatment, habilitation and services to\nrespond to that impairment, or (b) who have been evaluated and\ndetermined to require treatment, habilitation or services but who\nhave not received such treatment, habilitation or services, or\n(c) who have been evlaluated and determined  to require treatment,\nhabilitation or services but whose programs and services are not\nin accordance with accepted professional judgment, practice or\nstandards.\n19.  Upon information and belief, the class is so numerous\nthat joinder of all members is impractical.\n20.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class,\n-7-\n\nspecifically:  whether  the defendants have failed or refused to\nprovide appropriate care and treatment to individuals residing ir.\npyschiatric centers who are mentally retarded, and/or diagnosed\nas mentally retarded, and/or who have been regarded as mentally\nretarded.\n21.  The claims or defenses of the plaintiffs are typical of\nthe claims of the class.  Plaintiffs are class members and have\nno conflict of interest with other members of the class, all of\nwhom would benefit from the ruling sought.  The named plaintiffs\nhave a significant stake in the outcome of the action, identical -.:\nthat of all class members.\n22.  The representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.  Plaintiffs are represented\nby Legal Services of Central New York, Inc. which is experienced\nin class actions and litigation involving persons with\ndisabilities.  Legal Services of Central New York, Inc. has been\ndesignated by the New York State Commission on Quality of Care to\nprovide protection and advocacy services to persons with\ndisabilities in Central New York.\n23.  Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable\nto the class by violating their constitutional and statutory right\nto appropriate care and treatment.\n24.  This common conduct makes injunctive or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief as to the class appropriate under Rule\n-8-\n\n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  If class  i\ncertification  is not granted, individuals must bring separate  j\nactions, thereby causing a waste of judicial and governmental  ;\nj\nresources.  Further, the very nature of the plaintiffs1 mental  '\nretardation and their institutionalization makes the bringing of  j\nindividual suits unlikely.  Upon information and belief, many  i\ni\npatients do not have parents or guardians actively in contact\n!\nwith them, making joinder difficult.  Without class\ncertification, these individuals' rights would go unprotected.\nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND\n25.  The type of facility and range of services appropriate\nfor persons with mental retardation meet the standards applicable\nto Intermediate Care Facilities for the Developmentally Disabled\n(\"ICF\").  ICF level care is appropriate for persons who have,\ninter alia, mental retardation, and habilitative and/or rehabili-\ntative needs, evidenced by a moderate or severe deficit in their\ncommunication, learning, mobility, ability to live independently,\nself-control or behavior.  ICF level care provides training to\npermit the maximal development of skills that will enable its\nrecipients to function as independently as their handicapping\nconditions will permit.\n26.  The standards for care and treatment of mentally\nretarded persons in an ICF are set for in the 42 C.F.R. §§442.400\net. seq. and in the New York Mental Hygiene regulations at Part\n\n681.  Among other things, these standards restrict  the persons\nwho may live together, and state the intensity and type of\nprograms that must be offered and the size and qualifications of\nthe facilities' staff.  42 C.F.R. §§442.434-35 and 442.446 and\n14 N.Y.C.R.R. §§681.6 and 681.7(b) also require defendants to\ndevelop an individual program plan for each plaintiff, and to\ndevelop sufficient programs and services to carry out each\nplaintiff's program plan.\n27.  Persons in need of ICF level care must be placed with\nother persons who have similar ages and functioning  levels.  42\nC.F.R. §442.444 and 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §681.4(c)(3) (xii)(a) prohibit\nhousing persons who are of widely divergent ages, developmental\nlevels and social needs in close proximity to one another unless\nthere is a written plan stating how such a grouping will promote\nthe growth and development of all the persons living together.\nOne purpose of this requirement  is to allow these persons to\nparticipate jointly in programs, recreation and other activities,\nand to allow them to serve as role models for, and to learn from\neach other.\n28.  Persons in need of ICF level care must receive\n\"active treatment.\"  The Mental Hygiene regulations state\nthat active treatment requires an individual program  that\nprescribes an integrated program of activities, experiences or\ntherapies necessary for the client to reach program goals or\n-10-\n\nobjectives with the overall purpose to help the client  function  !\nat the greatest physicial, intellectual, social or vocational  j\nI\nlevel he or she can presently or potentially  receive.  14  j\ni\nN.Y.C.R.R. §681.13 and 42 C.F.R. §442.435.\nt\n29.  Active treatment must be delivered  in a manner which is  \\\ni\ni\nnormalizing and conducive to individual growth.  Individual  |\nprogram plans are required to reflect this goal.  42 C.F.R.\n§442.456 and 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §681.l(b).  i\n30.  Among the programs and services that constitute active  j\ntreatment are a specific \"core\" of services that must be provided\n  ;\ni\non a daily basis.  The Mental Hygiene regulations identify these\nservices which include inter alia, nutrition, recreation,\nself-care, and vocational training and habilitation services.  14\nN.Y.C.R.R. §§681.7, 681.13(dd) and 42 C.F.R. §442.435 and\n§443.464.\n31.  Nutrition services are required to make meals a time for\nlearning rather than simply for eating.  Recipients of these ser-\nvices must be given utensils appropriate for their  functioning\nlevels, receive training on how to use those utensils and to eat\nappropriately, and be supervised by an adequate number of speci-\nfically trained staff who will promote proper eating habits and\nskills.  42 C.F.R. §442.472 and 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §681.7(d)(2).\n32.  Recreation must be a time for learning.  Each person\nrequiring ICF level care must have the opportunity to participate\n-11-\n\nin planned programs of leisure or recreation activities on a\ndaily basis.  This recreational time must be in addition  to the  :\ntime spent in active treatment.  42 C.F.R. §442.491 and  14\nN.Y.C.R.R. §681.7(d)(3).  Each facility is required  to have ade-\nquate capacity to provide transportation to and from recreation  !\ni\nprograms.  42 C.F.R. §442.491 and 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §681.7(d)(6).  i\n33.  Self-care training  is required to improve the person's  '\nability to independently perform routine activities of daily  •\nliving.  The regulations require residents to receive training ir. j\nbathing, brushing teeth, shampooing and grooming hair, shaving\nand nail care.  14 N.Y.C.R.R. §681.7(d)(4); and 42 C.F.R.\n§442.494, §§442.433, 442.478 and 442.494.\n34.  Habilitation services and vocational training  programs\nare required to teach skills that will be necessary for living\nand working in the community.  This training and services must be\nappropriate to the person's chronological age and his or her\nlevel of functioning, and designed to meet the objectives of the\nperson's individual treatment plan.  It may include  training\nrelated to performing household chores, as well as vocational or\npre-vocational skills that will be needed for participation in\nday-training or employment in a sheltered workshop or in the com-\npetive economy.  14 N.Y.C.R.R. §681.7(d)(5); §681.13(dd ) (1) (v).\n35.  In addition to the core services, the regulations iden-\ntify services that must be provided on a \"routine\" basis.\n-12-\n\nRoutine services must be provided regularly, but not necessarily\non a daily basis.  They include social services, which must be\ndesigned  to maximize the person's social functioning.  The regu-\nlations also identify \"special\" services, which must be provided\nwhen they are specified  in a person's treatment plan, including\nspeech, physical and occupational therapy.  42 C.F.R.  §§442.486\n- 442.498 and 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §§681;7(e) and (f).\n36.  The regulations identify the types of staff and staff\nratios that must be present to provide the required programs and\nservices.  The number of staff for each core, routine and special\nservice as well as direct care staff is stated in the regula-\ntions, and is dependent upon the mix of characteristics present\namong persons who are mentally retarded and persons who are\nmultiply-handicapped persons.  The regulations also mandate that\nall staff must undergo periodic training programs to update and\nimprove their skills.  42 C.F.R. §§442.431, 442.445, 442.462,\n442.464, 442.480, 442.490, 442.493, 442.498 and 14 C.F.R.  §§681.2\nand 681.8.\n37.  All mentally retarded and multiply handicapped persons\nwho are patients in facilities operated by the Office of Mental\nHealth (\"OMH\"), including plaintiffs, have a right to\n11 individualized care and treatment.  The Mental Hygiene Law\n(\"MHL\") at §33.03(a) states \"[ejach patient in a facility and\neach person receiving services for mental disability shall\n-13-\n\nreceive care and treatment that is suited to his needs, and\nskillfully, safely and humanely administered  \"\n38.  The New York State Mental Hygiene Law  (MHL) and Mental\nHygiene regulations  (14 New York Code, Rules and Regulations)\nmandate that OMH work cooperatively with OMRDD to plan for,\ndevelop and implement a comprehensive system of programs and\nservices to meet plaintiffs' identified needs.  MHL at §§7.07(a)\nand  13.07(a).  Their  joint efforts are to ensure both the\ncomprehensiveness and quality of the programs and services that\nare provided.  Mental Hygiene Law at §§7.09(a) and 7.15(b) and\n13.09(a) and 13.15(b) authorizes Commissioners Surles and Webb,\nrespectively, to enter into agreements for the conduct and\nprovision of services.  The Mental Hygiene regulations at\n§561.l{a) authorize the two Commissioners to allow OMRDD to\noperate programs for the mentally retarded and developmentally\ndisabled  in OMH facilities.  Mental Hygiene Law at §5.O5(a)\ndirects the Commissioners of OMH and OMRDD to jointly visit and\ninspect all facilities providing care and treatment to the\nmentally disabled.  Mental Hygiene Law §5.05(b); 5.07; 7.05; and\n13.05, directs the Commissioners of OMH and OMRDD to work\ntogether to develop long range plans for the care and treatment\nof the mentally disabled.  The Mental Health regulations at\n§27.3(d) require OMRDD to ensure that service plans for the\nmentally disabled are periodically evaluated.  OMH and OMRDD have\n-14-\n\nentered  into agreements to carry out these statutory\nresponsibilities.\n39.  The Mental Hygiene Law at §29.13(a) and the Mental\nHygiene regulations at §27.3(aa) direct defendant Richard M.\nHeath, as Director of Mohawk Valley Psychiatric Center, defendant\nDwight Rhodes, as Director of 3inghamton Psychiatric Center, and\nJohn R. Scott as Director of Hutchings Psychiatric Center to\ndevelop a written individualized  treatment plan for every\nplaintiff  in the three facilities.\n40.  The Mental Hygiene regulations at §27.1(b),  implementing\nthe MHL provisions, state that the purpose of the individual\ntreatment plan is to provide all mentally disabled persons with\nan \"individualized program of services which will maximize their\nability to cope with their environment/ will foster social and\nvocational competence and will enable them to live as indepen-\ndently as possible.\"  Under Mental Hygiene regulations §27.3(c),\nthe plan's contents must describe the plaintiffs' treatment\ngoals, and the methods, procedures, techniques and activities to\nbe used to meet those goals.  Both the plaintiffs and their plans\nmust be re-assessed at regular intervals, to ensure the adequacy\nof the programs, treatment and therapies employed.  14 N.Y.C.R.R.\n§27(d).\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nA.  Plaintiff Class Has Been Denied Care and Treatment\nAppropriate for Person With Mental Retardation.\n-15-\n\n1.  Plaintiff class members do not reside with\npersons who are of similar ages and\nfunctional levels\n41.  At Binghamton Psychiatric Center, Mohawk Valley\nPsychiatric Center, and Hutchings Psychiatric Center, adult\npatients are not placed in a particular ward because of their\nparticular developmental levels, ages or social needs.  Plaintiff\nclass members do not reside with other persons who have similar\ndevelopmental levels and social needs.  The mix of persons who\nreside with the plaintiffs is too divergent to promote\nplaintiffs' functional growth or development or maintain their\nlevel of skill and functioning at the time of their entry into\nthe institution.\n42.  At Binghamton Psychiatric Center, John R. resides on a\nward with long-term chronic patients of widely divergent ages\nwhose primary diagnosis is mental illness.  John R. is 32 years\nold.  John R. is not mentally ill.\n43.  At Mohawk Valley Psychiatric Center, John S. resides on\na unit where, upon information and belief, the majority of per-\nsons have a primary diagnosis of mental illness.  John S. has\nbeen \"dually diagnosed\" with impairments of both mental retar-\ndation and mental illness.\n44.  Plaintiff John S. has resided in a geriatric unit,\ndesigned for older persons, since age 52.\n-16-\n\nI\n\\\nI\n45.  Plaintiff Patricia R. age 33, resides on a unit where\nupon information and belief, the majority of patients do not have '\nmental retardation.  Patricia R. has been \"dually diagnosed\" with !\nimpairments of both mental retardation and mental  illness.  j\nPatricia R. currently resides on a unit where the patients are of I\nwidely divergent ages.  ;\ni\n46.  Upon information and belief, class members do not reside\nwith persons who are of similar ages and developmental  levels in\naccordance with federal and state regulations.  42 C.F.R.\ni\n§442.444 and 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §681.4(c)(3)(xii)(a).  I\n2.  Plaintiff class members do not receive  !\nprograms and services appropriate to  |\ntheir individual needs\n47.  Binghamton Psychiatric Center, Mohawk Valley Psychiatric\nCenter, and Hutchings Psychiatric Center fail to provide programs\nand services that are appropriate to class members' individual\nneeds, or that are necessary to maintain the level of skill and\nfunctioning of the class members at the time of their entry into\nthe psychiatric center.  Instead, upon information and belief,\nthe lives of the class members' are marked by an unchanging daily\nroutine largely filled with idle time.  None of the plaintiffs\nreceives care and treatment that will permit achievement of the\nfunctional goals stated in the federal and state regulations.\n48.  \"Active treatment\" required by the Mental Hygiene regu-\nlations is not provided to plaintiffs.  14 N.Y.C.R.R.§681.13(a).\n-17-\n\n49.  The failure to provide sufficient programs and services\nto constitute \"active treatment\" also deprives plaintiffs of the\n\"core\" services to which they are entitled.  Plaintiffs do not\nreceive nutrition, recreation, self-care, or training and habili-\ntation programs and services to meet their individual needs.\nNutrition services which train plaintiffs in appropriate\neating habits and use of utensils are not provided.  OMH\nstaff at times assist plaintiffs in eating, but class members\nhave no structured learning programs for developing proper eating\nskills.\n50.  Appropriate recreation services are not provided.\nClass members' participation in community activities through\nrecreation activities is not encouraged. Recreation, when\nprovided, is not part of a program to achieve behavorial goals in\nplaintiffs' program plans.  At Mohawk Valley, it is noted in his\nclinical record that John S. spends his days wandering the ward.\n51.  At Hutchings Psychiatric Cneter, it is frequently noted\nin Patricia R.'s clinical record that she spends her time pacing\nand wandering about the wards.\n52.  Class members do not receive self-care training which\nteaches them to maintain their skills in performing daily living\nactivities such as bathing, grooming, and dressing or to achieve\ngreater independence.  These skills are necessary  for class\nmembers to attend programming and live in the community away from\n-18-\n\nthe institution.\n53.  All of the class members require, but do not receive,\nself-care training suited to their individual needs.  Their\nindividual needs vary, but as to all of the plaintiffs, the\nBinghamton, Mohawk Valley and Hutchings Psychiatric Center staff\nare only able to supervise and at times assist plaintiffs with\nthese tasks.  These staff efforts do not provide training that\nwill lead to achieving the behavorial goals stated in any of the\nplaintiffs' program plans or to maintain their level of skill and\nfunctioning.\n54.  Habilitation and vocational training programs, which\nshould teach class members the skills they will require to live\nin the community away from the institution are not provided.\nThese include training related to performing household chores, as\nwell as vocational or pre-vocational tasks that plaintiffs will\nrequire to participate in community based day programming,\nsheltered workshop employment, or employment in the competitive\neconomy.  None of the plaintiffs receives habilitation and\nvocational training programs that are designed to achieve\nbehavioral goals in their program plans.\n55.  In addition to not providing the core services,\nBinghamton, Mohawk Valley, and Hutchings do not provide the\n\"routine\" and \"special\" services to which plaintiffs are\nentitled.  Class members require extensive social services to\n-19-\n\nmodify and improve their inappropriate behaviors and their\n  ;\nisolation on the wards.  !\ni\n56.  At Mohawk Valley Psychiatric Center, plaintiff John S.  '\nI\nexhibits the problem of pica.  John S. eats cigarette butts and  |\nashes, eats and plays with feces, drinks from urinals, and eats\npaper and other waste basket items.  OMH staff note that coun-  j\nseling has been ineffective in reducing pica.  However, John S.  |\ni\nis not engaged  in an active program to modify this behavior.  1\n57.  Plaintiff John R. exhibits self-abusive and aggressive  j\nbehavior and is teased and injured by other patients.  However,  |\nnone of these behaviors is being addressed by a behavior modifi-\ncation program.\n58.  It is noted in Plaintiff Patricia R.'s clinical record\nthat she exhibits inattention to hygiene, poor dining habits,\nscavenging for cigarette butts and probable polydipsia as a\nresult of her long-term  institutionalization.\n59.  Upon information and belief, plaintiff class members are\nisolated on their wards, with little or no interaction with\nresidents on other wards.  Upon information and belief, the class\nmembers' isolation on the wards is reinforced by their  limited\ncommunication skills, yet none receive communication training as\na special service to address these deficits.\n60.  It is noted in Plaintiff Patricia R.'s clinical record\nthat her speech is slurred at frequent intervals, and that as an\n-20-\n\napparent result of her mental retardation she appears to have\ndifficulty understanding  the staff.\n61.  Upon information and belief, the defendants' failure to\ni\nprovide appropriate programs and services to class members has  I\nresulted in a deterioration  in each class member's level of skill\nand functioning.\n3.  Plaintiff class members are not provided\nwith care and treatment that will enable\nthem to become de-institutionalized\n62.  In total, Binghamton Psychiatric Center, Mohawk Valley\nPsychiatric Center, and Hutchings Psychiatric Center do not\nprovide care, treatment, programs and services to the plaintiffs\nin a manner which is normalizing and conducive to their\nindividual growth as required by the Mental Hygiene  regulations\nat §§25.l(b) and 681.l(b).  Plaintiffs are not being taught the\nskills and behaviors they will need to live in the community away\nfrom the psychiatric centers.  In several instances it is noted\nin the clinical records that plaintiffs John S. and John R., and\nPatricia R. have adopted  institutionalized behavior and\n\"culture\".\n63.  None of the plaintiff class members is so handicapped as\nto require lifelong institutionalization.  Persons with a degree\nof mental retardation equal to that of any of the class have been\nsuccessfully placed in community-based  residential settings.  But\n-21-\n\nj\nabsent the programs and services necessary to teach plaintiff  !\nI\nclass members the essential skills for community  living, they\nwill be forced to remain in institutional settings.\n4.  Binghamton Psychiatric Center, Mohawk Valley\nPsychiatric Center, and Hutchings Psychiatric\nCenter do not have sufficient numbers of\nappropriately trained staff to provide plaintiff\nclass members with care, treatment, programs\nand services they require to maintain their\nskills and developmental levels, and protect\nthem from bodily harm.\n64.  Binghamton, Mohawk Valley, and Hutchings do not have\nsufficient staff to provide care and treatment suited to\nplaintiff class members' individual needs.  Upon information and\nbelief, for much of the training plaintiff class members require,\nstaff must work individually with each plaintiff class member,\nwhile providing verbal and physical assistance, or hand-over-hand\ndemonstrations of activities, and extensive repetition of each\nactivity.  The Mental Hygiene regulations at §681.12 identify the\nstaff-to-patient ratios that are required for these programs and\nservices.  Upon information and belief, the staff-to-patient\nratios in the plaintiff class members' wards at Binghamton,\nMohawk Valley, and Hutchings do not meet the criteria required by\nthe regulations.  OMRDD does not generally make its staff\navailable to the psychiatric centers, and neither OMH nor OMRDD\nhas contracted to have the staff of a community based  service\n-22-\n\nprovider work with plaintiff class members at the psychiatric\ncenter.\n65.  The Binghamton, Mohawk Valley, and Hutchings staff also\nare not trained to provide the full range of programs and\nservices that the plaintiff class members require.  Ongoing staff\ntraining programs are required by the Mental Hygiene regulations\nat §681.8(b)(13);(14) but upon information and belief, there is\nno training in the care and treatment of persons with mental\nretardation for the staff at these facilities.\n66.  Defendants have failed to provide the environment and\nthe training for plaintiff class members that protects them\nagainst physical harm and preserves their basic self-care skills.\n67.  Since August, 1989, plaintiff Patricia R. has suffered a\nbroken arm, an assault by fellow patients and a broken leg.  Upon\ninformation and belief, the lack of sufficient numbers of staff\nwas a contributing factor in these occurences.\n68.  The lack of sufficient numbers of staff to provide\nprograms and services to mentally retarded persons makes it\nimpossible for the members of the plaintiff class to receive care\nand treatment that is suited to their individual needs or needed\nto maintain their level of skill and development, and to protect\nthem from bodily harm.\n5.  Plaintiffs have been denied care and treatment\nas recommended by defendants' professionals.\n69.  The professional staff at Binghamton Psychiatric Center,\nMohawk Valley Psychiatric Center and Hutchings Psychiatric Center\n-23-\n\nwho are involved with plaintiffs' care have stated that they\nrequire care and treatment that addresses the learning and\nindependent  functioning deficits caused by plaintiffs' mental\nretardation and that they require care, treatment and programs\nappropriate for persons with mental retardation.\n70.  In the case of plaintiffs John S., John R. and Patricia\nR., it is the judgment of defendants' professionals that\ncontinued residence at facilities operated by OMH is detrimental\nto those plaintiffs, and that a placement providing .care,\ntreatment and programs appropriate for persons with mental\nretardation is necessary to prevent further deterioration in\ntheir skills and development.\n71.  The professional staff at Binghamton Psychiatric Center\nand Hutchings Psychiatric Center has sought to obtain care and\ntreatment for John R. and Patricia R. by referring these\nplaintiffs to OMRDD.  OMRDD is the New York State government\nagency responsible for the care and treatment of persons who are\nmentally retarded.\n72.  The professional staff at Mohawk Valley Psychiatric\nCenter has recommended that John S. be placed in a setting\nspecifically designed for the implementation of behavior\nmodification programs.\n73.  Defendants have not transferred plaintiffs, John S.,\nJohn R. and Patricia R. to settings with programs appropriate for\n-24-\n\npersons with mental retardation and/or to settings with behavior\nmodification programs as recommended by defendants'\nprofessionals.  Defendants have continued the plaintiffs in\npsychiatric  facilities lacking the staff, programs and ability to\nprovide appropriate care and treatment to persons with mental\nretardation.\n74.  Defendants have failed to provide to plaintiffs John R.,\nJohn R. and Patricia services and programs suitable to their\ndiagnosis of mental retardation at the psychiatric  facilities\nwhere they now reside.\n75.  Upon information and belief, the defendants have engaged\nin and continue to engage in a pattern and practice of failing to\nimplement the recommendations of their own professionals with\nregard to the care, treatment, programs and services provided to\nplaintiff class members.\n8.  Plaintiff Class Members are not Receiving\nCare and Treatment Required by State\nLaw and Regulations\n76.  Plaintiff class members have not received care and\ntreatment suited to their needs, and have not received  treatment\nin a skillful or safe manner.\n77.  Upon information and belief, Binghamton, Mohawk Valley\nand Hutchings Center do not have written plans stating how\nplaintiffs' functional growth or development will be further\n-25-\n\nenhanced either by the services they currently  receive or by\ntheir current residential placement.\n78.  The class members' treatment plans do not meet the\nrequirements of the Mental Hygiene regulations.  The plans do not\ncomprehensively describe how each of plaintiffs' functional\ndeficits will be addressed, or identify the goals that are to be\nachieved.\n79.  The OMH staff at Binghamton Psychiatric Center, Mohawk\nValley, and Hutchings Psychiatric Center have not been trained tc\nwrite a treatment plan or provide services adequate to address\nthe individual needs of the class members.  The OMH staff at the\npsychiatric centers is trained to evaluate, plan for and provide\ncare, treatment and rehabilitation to persons with acute and\nchronic mental illnesses.  The Mental Hygiene regulations at\n§82.Kb) governing the operation of the psychiatric centers\nstates the methods, procedures and practices used to provide\ncare, treatment and rehabilitation to persons with mental\nillness.  Mental illness is an impairment distinct and different  j\nfrom mental retardation.  The treatment provided  in response to\nmental illness is not the same as those used to provide training  |\ni\nand rehabilitation to persons with mental retardation.\nDeveloping a treatment plan for plaintiffs requires  specialists\nI\nin mental retardation with training experience in that field;  j\ni\nsuch specialists are not present at Binghamton, Mohawk Valley or  !\n-26-\n\nHutchings Psychiatric Center.\n80.  OMRDD has not provided training  to the OMH staff so that\nthey will be able to evaluate and write treatment plans for the\nclass members.  Upon information and belief, OMRDD has not sent\nits own staff to Binghamton, Mohawk Valley or Hutchings\nPsychiatric Centers to perform these tasks directly.  Neither OMH\nnor OMRDD has contracted for the class members to be evaluated\nand have their treatment plans written by a qualified  community\nbased service provider.\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n81.  Defendants have violated plaintiffs' right under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of\nthe United States and 42 U.S.C. §1983 by failing to provide\nservices and programs and/or placements to which members of the\nplaintiff class are entitled.\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n82.  Defendants have violated plaintiff class members' rights\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nConstitution of the United States and 42 U.S.C. §1983 by failing\nto provide adequate care and treatment to keep plaintiff class\nfree from bodily harm.\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n83.  Defendants have violated plaintiff class members' rights\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United\n-27-\n\nStates and 42 U.S.C. §1983 by engaging in a pattern and practice\nof failing to provide care and treatment which defendants'\nprofessionals have determined to be necessary for the adequate\ntraining and habilitation of said class members.\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n84.  Defendants have violated plaintiff class members' rights\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United\nStates and 42 U.S.C. §1983 by failing to provide the care and\ntreatment necessary to preserve plaintiff class members basic\nself-care skills and to prevent deterioration thereof.\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n85.  Defendants have violated plaintiff class members' rights\nguaranteed by the New York Mental Hygiene Law and regulations\nthereunder by:\n(a)  failing to provide plaintiff class members with the\ncare and treatment stated in their individual treatment plans;\n(b)  failing to provide care, treatment programs and\nservices appropriate to persons with mental retardation;\n(c)  failing provide the care and the treatment\ndefendants' professionals determined that plaintiff class members\nrequire, and\n(d)  failing to provide appropriate numbers of\nadequately trained staff to provide the programs and services\nrequired  to implement plaintiff class members' individual\n-28-\n\ntreatment plans.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs request that the Court grant the\nfollowing relief:\n1.  Certify this action as a class action, and certify a  j\nclass consisting of all current and future patients at Mohawk  •\nValley Psychiatric Center, Binghamton Psychiatric Center, and  j\nHutchings Psychiatric Center who are mentally retarded, and/or  !\ndiagnosed as mentally retarded and/or who have been regarded as  !\nmentally retarded;  and (a) who never have been evaluated by  '\ni\ndefendants' professional staff to determine whether they require  {\ntreatment, habilitation and services to respond to that impair-\nment, or (b) who have been evaluated and determined  to require\ntreatment, habilitation or services but who have not received\nsuch treatment, habilitation or services, or (c) who have been\nevlaluated and determined to require treatment, habilitation or\nservices but whose programs and services are not in accordance\nwith accepted professional judgment, practice or standards;  and\n2.  Declare that defendants' failure to provide such training\nand placement as is necessary to implement the judgment of\ndefendants' professional staff concerning plaintiff class\nmembers' training and placement needs violates their  liberty\ninterest which is guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42\n-29-\n\nU.S.C. S1983 and 28 U.S.C. §2201 and §2202;  and\n3.  Declare defendants failure to provide training and an\nenvironment  for class members that protects them against physical\nharm and preserves their basic self-care skills violates\nplaintiffs liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and 42\nU.S.C. §1983;  and\n4.  Direct, through a permanent injunction, that defendants\nprovide to plaintiffs services and programs in the psychiatric\ncenters suited to diagnosis of mental retardation or, that they\nbe placed in another facility where they will receive programs\nand services that will provide them with appropriate care and\ntreatment;  and\n5.  Direct, through permanent injunction, that defendants\nprovide class members with the training and environment necessary\nto protect class members from physical harm and to preserve their\nbasic self-care skills;  and\n6.  Declare that defendants have failed to provide plaintiff\nclass members with care and treatment suited to their  individual\nneeds, based upon an individualized treatment plan, and that\ndefendants have failed to provide the staff, programs and\nservices required to meet the goals and objectives stated in\nthose plans, and that such failures violate plaintiff  class\nmembers' rights to care and treatment guaranteed by the New York\n-30-\n\nI\nMental Hygiene Law and regulations; and\n7.  Permanently enjoin defendants immediately to commence to\nprovide all class members with care and treatment suited to their !\nindividual needs based on an individualized assessment and treat-\nment plan; and immediately to commence providing the staff,\nprograms and services required to meet the goals and objectives\nstated in those plans; and\n8.  Direct defendants to pay to plaintiffs' their  litigation\ncosts and reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988;\nand\n9.  Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem\njust and proper.\nDated:  Syracuse, New York\nMarch 14, 1990\nRespectfully  submitted,\nW  !A\nStfSAN  M.
