    "summary": "<p>On June 13, 1984, ten residents of the Letchworth Village Development Center (LVDC) in Thiells, New York, along with a parents/representatives organization called Rights, Equality Always at Letchworth, Inc. (REAL), filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the State of New York in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging  that their constitutional rights had been violated by the defendants' failure to provide plaintiffs with constitutionally and statutorily mandated levels of care, habilitation, training, education, and treatment, as well as maintaining the plaintiffs in a setting where such services cannot properly be provided.  </p><p>On September 3, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Charles E. Stewart) dismissed REAL as a party to the lawsuit for lack of standing and certified the plaintiffs as a class.  Rights Equality Always at Letchworth v. Cuomo, No. 84-4163, 1985 WL 129 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 1985).  On November 14, 1985, the district court (Judge Stewart) appointed REAL guardian ad litem to assist the plaintiffs in representing the interests of absent class members.</p><p>On November 25, 1986, the defendants asked the court to dismiss the case for lack of standing of the remaining plaintiffs.  On October 14, 1986, the district court denied the motion for dismissal.</p><p>On November 14, 1988, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, which was adopted by the court on November 19, 1991.  On March 3, 1993, the district court ordered the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with a comprehensive implementation plan for the closure of LVDC.  The closure was to take place by March 31, 1996, and the plan was to specify the number of community placements to be made out of LVDC.  This is where our docket information, accurate as of 4/18/07, ends.</p><p></p>",

Sosna v.  Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402 n.11 (1975). \n \n \n2  The quoted section is from Rule 23(b)( 2). As plaintiffs believe this to be “the achetypical 23(b)(2 ) class action” and therefore have \nrelegated their Rule 23(b)(1) argument to a footnote in their Memorandum in Support of Class Certification (Memorandum in \n \nSupport, pg. 15), the Court sees no reason to address plaintiffs’ (b)(1) argument further as it believes certification pursuant to (b)(2) \nis warranted. \n \n3  It is noted that while the Second Circuit in Societyfor Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (1984) “relied on \n[Youngberg ] extensively” :n reviewing the district court’s substantive rulings, it did not cite to You ngberg where affirming the \n \ncertification of plaintiffs’ class. And in Woe v. Cuomo, 709 F.2d 96, cert. denied,105 S.Ct. 339 (1984) the Second Circuit cites \nwhere stating that decertification was an abuse of discretion. \n \n4  The only case cited by the State defendants factually similar to the present action is Burnham v. Dept of Public Health of Georgia, \n349 F.Supp. 1335 (N.D.Ga.1972). That Court’s statement that the adequacy of treatment should not be considered on a c1asswide \n \nbasis shou1d be considered mere dicta inasmuch as only a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction was before the \nCourt, and not a motion for class certification. Only after ruling that there was no federal constitutional right to treatment, and that \ntherefore the action, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983, should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, did the court brief1y \nconcern itself with the adequacy of classwide relief. Furthermore, as to the jurisdictional issue the court subsequently was reversed \n(502 F.2d 1319). \n \n5  According to the affidavit of Jack Bernstein, President of the Welfare League, his organization is the “official parent group at \nLetchworth,” having been founded by parents of Letchworth residents in 1939. \n \n \n6  Though the effect of the decertification decision on the action’s ultimate disposition i s of no concern to this Court, it is noted that \n“loss of HHS certification may signal inadequate institutional conditions Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 106 n.11. \n  5 \n \n\nRights Equality Always at Letchworth, Inc. v. Cuomo, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1985)   \n \n   \n7  For example, of 359 responses to the question, “Has your resident been subjected to any major incidents or accidents?” there were \n109 eyes’ responses and 24 ‘don’t know.’ Similarly, as to a general question concerning whether “you are satisfied with the care \n \nand treatment your resident is current1y receiving,” of 355 responses 67 answered in the negative with an additional 22 stating they \nhad insufficient knowledge of the situation. \n \n8  Albert P. Robidoux, the Director of Letchworth Village, testified that “similar deficiencies” to those documented in the March \n1984 Federal survey were found in a State study (Plaintiffs’ Supp. Declaration, Ex. B). \n \n \n9  The irony of the situation in class certif icatior motions where defendants are concerned with the adequacy of plaintiffs’ \nrepresentation of the class is duly noted. See Foxv. Prudent Resources Trust, 69 F.R.D. 74 (E.D.Pa.1975). \n \n \n10  See Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 574 F. Supp. 994, 996 where Chief Judge Jack B. Weinstein noted that \n“[b]oth Mr. Schneps and Mr. Lottman represented their clients with extraordinary skill and tenacity.” \n \n \n11  While the Court acknowledges the concern expressed by Jack Bernstein, President of the Welfare League, that the lawsuit will \ncause the State to divert “finite resources available for the treatment and habilitation of the residents,” and that possible gains may \n \ntake years to achieve, these problems are not peculiar to the current plaintiffs but affect anyone who attempts to change the status \nquo through litigation. These are not reasons to deny class certification. \n \n12  REAL is an organization of parents and representatives of residents, and thus no residents are members. Obviously residents have \nalleged sufficient injury for purposes of standing. \n \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  6 \n ",
