    "summary": "<p>On August 23, 1978, the Society for Good Will to Retarded Children filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of residents of the Suffolk Developmental Center (later called Long Island Developmental Center), an institution for people with intellectual disabilities in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The lawsuit sought to improve conditions at the facility and provide small residential facilities for most of its clients.</p>\r\n<p>A lengthy trial was held in 1982. On February 24, 1983, the district court (Judge Jack B. Weinstein) issued an interim memorandum and order requiring the Director of the facility to provide the court with a written four-year plan for improvement of the institution. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 572 F. Supp. 1298 (E.D.N.Y. 1983).</p>\r\n<p>On August 10, 1983, the court (Judge Weinstein) issued an opinion outlining the constitutional violations within the facility in the areas of food, shelter, clothing, and medical care. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 572 F. Supp. 1300 (E.D.N.Y. 1983). The court noted that its opinion in <a href=\"../../../../case/478/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York State Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey</a>&nbsp;was used as guidance in determining the standards of care for individuals in developmental centers. The court found conditions at Suffolk Developmental Center to be lacking in many areas, including staffing, training, physical environment, and community programs. The court also found that the written plan provided by the center lacked detailed steps to remedy the constitutional violations and made changes to it.</p>\r\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decision, holding that the district court failed to specify which parts of its order were designed to remedy federal constitutional violations and which were addressing state constitutional violations. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir. 1984). It noted that some of the district court's findings could only be supported by state law and federal courts could not grant injunctive relief based on state constitutional violations. On remand, the district court (Judge Weinstein) held that the defendants voluntarily agreed to continue to implement its plan for improving the state facility following the August 10, 1983 court order and the issue was therefore moot. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 103 F.R.D. 168 (E.D.N.Y. 1984).</p>\r\n<p>In 1986, plaintiffs moved to reinstate the case, alleging continued violations of federal constitutional law. Judge Weinstein denied the motion and granted plaintiffs sixty days to file a new complaint. The Second Circuit reversed and remanded so the district court could reinstate the case and enforce those parts of the 1983 order that were based in federal constitutional law. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 832 F.2d 245 (2d Cir. 1987). On remand, the district court (Judge Weinstein) found that although there were improvements, there remained constitutional violations in the center. Society for Good Will for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 718 F. Supp. 139 (E.D.N.Y. 1989). It ordered the state to implement a plan to make improvements. The Second Circuit reversed and remanded because the district court's findings were not adequate to review the case. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 902 F.2d 1085 (2d Cir. 1990). Litigation regarding attorneys' fees continued throughout this period.</p>\r\n<p>On September 26, 1990, Judge Weinstein entered a memorandum, stipulation and order, approving the settlement of the lawsuit. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 745 F. Supp. 879 (E.D.N.Y. 1990). The court noted that conditions at the facility had greatly improved and many residents had been moved to community-based homes. The stipulation was to remain in effect until March 31, 1993 and required defendants to continue meeting constitutional standards.</p>\r\n<p>The Long Island Developmental Center closed in June of 1993 and transitioned to a community-based service system. The case was closed on June 24, 1993.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

CUOMO, as Governor of the State of New York, et al., Defendants.\nNo. 78-CV-1847 (JBW).\nUnited States District Court, E.D. New York.\nSeptember 26, 1990.\nMurray B. Schneps, Riverhead, N.Y., Michael S. Lottman, New York City, for plaintiffs.\nCaren S. Brutten, Asst. Atty. Gen., New York City, Alan M. Adler, Deputy Counsel, New York State Office of\nMental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, Albany, N.Y., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM, STIPULATION AND ORDER\nWEINSTEIN, District Judge.\nThe stipulation set out below settles a class action on behalf of mentally-retarded residents of the Long Island\nDevelopmental Center filed some twelve years ago. At the time the action was brought visits by the court to the\nCenter revealed a deplorable situation. Clients lay half-naked and unattended in their own urine and feces on\ncold floors in dismal surroundings while untrained attendants watched television. The facility's inadequate\nprofessional personnel failed to provide suitable training or educational programs for residents. Entry into the\ninstitution often led to swift physical and emotional deterioration and loss of skills. The huge population of some\nfifteen hundred clients made effective management and control impossible.\nSince that time, observations during visits by the court as well as witnesses and documents reveal a substantial\nimprovement in conditions at the Center. Many clients have been moved to small community-based homes,\n880 personnel are generally suitably trained and the professional staff *880 has been expanded. Clients, in the main,\nare appropriately dressed, live in tastefully-decorated quarters, receive useful instruction, and are beginning to\ndevelop their capacity to live with as much dignity as their conditions allow.\nDuring this litigation an extensive dialogue between the trial and the appellate court judges has emphasized\nsubstantial theoretical and practical limits on the power of federal courts to order changes in state institutional\npractices. See Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 572 F.Supp. 1298 (E.D.N.Y. 1983), 572\nF.Supp. 1300 (E.D.N.Y.1983), vacated,737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984),on remand, 103 F.R.D. 168 (E.D.N.Y.1984),\n652 F.Supp. 515 (E.D.N.Y.1987), rev'd, 832 F.2d 245 (2d Cir.1987), on remand, 718 F.Supp. 139 (E.D.N.Y.1989), \naff'd without opinion, 891 F.2d 278 (2d Cir.1989), rev'd, 902 F.2d 1085 (2d Cir.1990); see also 574 F.Supp. 994\n(E.D.N.Y.1983) (attorneys' fees), rev'd, 737 F.Supp. 1253 (2d Cir.1984), on remand, 103 F.R.D. 169\n(E.D.N.Y.1984).\nNevertheless, cooperation by courts, federal administrative agencies with power to set standards and enforce\nthem by cutoff of funds, dedicated professionals and staff, together with conscientious supervising state agencies\nprovided with adequate funds, can yield significant improvements in state institutions for the developmentally\ndisabled. The constant pressure of a federal suit driven by devoted plaintiffs' counsel and sensitive defense\ncounsel can help accomplish more to enhance the living conditions of confined disabled persons than a black\nletter statement of the law would suggest is possible. The settlement reads as follows:\nWHEREAS, this class action for injunctive relief has been pending since 1978 and has once again been\nremanded by the Court of Appeals for further proceedings which are likely to be extensive and time-consuming;\nand\n\nWHEREAS, the parties are desireous of finally bringing this action to a close without the need for another trial\nand likely appeals,\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, by and between the plaintiffs and defendants,\nthat all of the claims set forth in the complaint are hereby settled and resolved, without any determination or\nconcession of liability, as follows:\n1.(a) The defendants shall maintain substantial compliance with the Federal Medicaid regulations (42 C.F.R.\n483.410 et seq) at Long Island Developmental Center (LIDC), including the Sagtikos, Sagamore and the small\nresidential units, and shall maintain the facility's certification as an ICF/MR.\n(b) Substantial compliance with Federal Medicaid regulations means, for the purposes of the Stipulation,\ncompliance with the active treatment condition of participation (42 C.F.R. 483.440) and with at least 210 of the\nfollowing 252 specific survey standards:\n  W107-109    Health, safety, sanitation\n  W122-139    Client rights\n  W143-148    Communication\n  W149-157    Abuse and neglect\n  W164-181    Professional program services\n  W182-185    Facility staffing\n  W186-188    Direct care staffing\n  W189-194    Staff training\n  W196-197    Active treatment\n  W206-248    Individual program plan\n  W249-251    Program implementation\n  W252-254    Program documentation\n  W255-265    Program monitoring and revision\n  W274-290    Behavior management\n  W295-309    Physical restraints\n  W310-318    Drug therapy\n  W319-328    Physician services\n  W331-342    Nursing services\n  W348-350    Dental services\n  W362-366    Drug regimen review\n  W407-408    Client living environment\n  W409-421    Client bedrooms\n  W422-423    Storage space\n  W424-426    Client bathrooms\n  W427-430    Heating and ventilation\n  W435-437    Space and equipment\n  W438-439    Emergency procedures\n  W452-453    Lead-free paint\n  W454-458    Infection control\n  W467-476    Meal service\n  W482-489    Dining areas\n(c) If LIDC or any unit thereof is decertified, or if the active treatment condition of participation is \"NOT MET\", or if\nnoncompliance is found in 43 or more of the standards listed in 1(b) above in any Federal or State Medicaid\nsurvey, plaintiffs may apply to this Court, upon notice and hearing, for any form of relief and the defendants may\noppose such application.\n881\n\n*881 (d) Defendants shall mail copies of all Federal or State ICF/MR deficiency reports and plans of correction,\nas well as notifications of adverse action with respect to any LIDC unit to the plaintiffs within three (3) working\ndays of their receipt or preparation by the facility.\n2. Defendants shall maintain an overall staff to client ratio at LIDC of at least 2 to 1.\n3.

The report shall also set forth the same information regarding each failed placement, the causes for\neach such failure and the plans for the amelioration of the cause and re-placement of each such person.\n4. Appropriate services, benefits, accommodations and programs, including but not limited nevertheless, to\nvocational and pre-vocational programming and community placement opportunities, shall not be denied to any\nclass member or group of class members on the basis of the nature or degree of their handicapping conditions or\non the basis of generalized assumptions that they are unable to benefit from certain activities or services.\n5. (a) Defendants shall protect the class of residents of LIDC from undue physical harm, preventable loss of\nskills, and other forms of preventable regression.\n(b) The defendants shall retain the services of Ms. Ronnie Cohn, or another person acceptable to plaintiffs'\ncounsel should Ms. Cohn be unavailable, as an independent expert consultant to inspect the facility and report\nand make recommendations to the parties as to all aspects of conditions, services, care, treatment, education,\ntraining, habilitation staffing and other related matters at LIDC (all units) which in her judgment may adversely\naffect defendants' ability to comply with 5(a) hereof. The independent expert consultant shall issue such a report\nwithin 6 months after the execution of this Stipulation and every 12 months thereafter. Additional reports, other\nthan those conducted pursuant to 5(e) below, shall be scheduled by agreement of the parties or by order of the\nCourt.\n(c) The independent expert consultant shall have full and complete access to all areas of the institution, all\nresidents, all staff, and all records, documents and reports of any nature she may require or request, and all staff\nshall be directed, permitted and required to answer all of her questions and requests for information freely,\npromptly and truthfully without fear of any retribution or disciplinary action.

Unless the court orders otherwise the\ncase will be deemed closed on April 30, 1993.\n9.

Adler, Deputy Counsel, State of N.Y., Albany, N.Y., for\ndefendants.\nMEMORANDUM, INTERIM FINDINGS AND ORDER\nWEINSTEIN, Chief Judge:\nThe Suffolk Developmental Center is a state institution in Melville, Long Island, housing some 1,200 clients 00\n97\nmost of them profoundly retarded 00 ranging from young children to adults in their sixties. This class action,\n97\ncommenced in August 1978, seeks, on constitutional and various statutory grounds, to improve conditions at the\nCenter and to provide small residential facilities for most of the clients.\n1299 *1299 Pending the issuance of a full opinion, the court makes the following interim findings of fact and law:\n1. In 1978 the care provided in the Center failed to meet the minimum standards required by the\nConstitution, thus depriving many clients of their basic constitutional rights.\n2. In the last four years conditions at the Center have improved markedly. In part favorable\nchanges have been due to fine institutional leadership, devoted professional and lay staff, lessons\nlearned from the Willowbrook experience (see, e.g., New York State Association for Retarded\nChildren, Inc. v. Carey, 393 F.Supp. 715 (E.D.N. Y.1975)), help from volunteers and relatives, and\nstate and federal assistance. In large measure, however, the current positive situation results from\nthe pressure of this lawsuit and evidence adduced by experts and other witnesses.\n3. The constitutional rights of many of the Center's clients are still being denied. Further\nsubstantial progress is required as a matter of law.\nThe United States Supreme Court has recently described the minimum standards for institutions of this type\nmandated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307,\n102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). A state must provide each client with conditions of reasonable safety and\nfreedom from undue restraint, adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care, and \"such training as an\nappropriate professional would consider reasonable to ensure his safety and to facilitate his ability to function free\nfrom bodily restraints.\" Id.102 S.Ct. at 2462.\nThe Court specified that these standards are to be determined by the judgment of \"appropriate\" qualified\nprofessionals; \"courts must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional\" as long as it is\nreasonable. Id. at 2461. The decision made by a qualified professional in charge of the institution \"is\npresumptively valid....\" Id. at 2462. The Court noted that\n\ntreatment decisions normally should be made by persons with degrees in medicine or nursing, or\nwith appropriate training in areas such as psychology, physical therapy, or the care and training of\nthe retarded.\nId. at n. 30.\nThis substantive rule of deference to on-the-scene professionals may present substantial difficulty in application\nat the trial level. Experts disagree. More important, perhaps, experts charged with administration of the institution\nmay not feel free to exercise untrammeled professional judgment since they are part of a team and statewide\nstructure. The desire to comply with budgetary pressures and statewide standards may cause a yielding of\nprofessional judgment to personal career perspectives. Should these pressures cause the professional in charge\nto neglect his professional duty to his clients, the court will step in and provide guidance. As the Supreme Court\nnoted, the trial court may impose its own plan\nwhen the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional\njudgment, practice or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not\nbase the decision on such a judgment.\nId. at 2462.\nThis case has already been long in resolution. Rather than delay it further while clients continue to suffer\nconstitutional deprivations, the court issues this interim memorandum and order.\nFred A. McCormack, Director of the Suffolk Developmental Center and Director of the Long Island\nDevelopmentally Disabled Services Office, is a competent professional. Within sixty days he shall provide the\ncourt with a written four year plan for improvement of the Center to the point where every client receives at least\n1300 the minimum *1300 care required by the Constitution. The plan shall specify for each year commencing\nSeptember 1, 1983, a program indicating the following in sufficient detail to permit appropriate budgeting,\npersonnel, training and other decisions:\n1. An increased rate of transfer from the central Suffolk Developmental facilities to residential or\nother small community facilities.\n2. An increased direct care staff ratio at the ward and dormitory care level, as well as in various\nprofessional specialties.\n3. An improved training program for those charged with care of clients so that necessary program\nactivities are incorporated in the context of the clients' daily living.\n4. Proper repairs to buildings particularly as to heating and air-conditioning, and provision of\nadequate recreational and rest facilities for clients and staff.\n5. Adequate prosthetic devices; special clothing where required; specially designed wheel chairs\nand carts where required, and sufficient numbers of vehicles equipped to transport them; and\nfurniture necessary and appropriate for clients with disabilities of the types involved here.\n6. Proper programming, particularly for those over 21 who are not being educated in the public\nschool systems.\nThe plan shall not be limited by budgetary restraints presently in effect or proposed. The Director may consult\nwith counsel, supervisory personnel, experts or others. The court desires a plan to be embodied in a decree\nwhich will insure compliance with the professional standards required by the Supreme Court. This is essentially a\nmedical-managerial judgment, not one for lawyers. See id. at 2461-62.\nWithin thirty days of receipt of the plan, the court will schedule a further hearing and argument. At that time any of\nthe parties may submit oral or written materials supporting or opposing the plan generally or in any of its details.\nNo further oral testimony will be taken. Experts, if any, will give their opinions by written statements.\n\nSo ordered.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Brutten, Stephen Mendelsohn, New York City, for\ndefendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nFINAL JUDGMENT\nWEINSTEIN, District Judge.\nThis litigation seeking relief for alleged unconstitutional conditions and violations of state and federal statutes at\nthe Long Island Developmental Center for profoundly mentally and otherwise disabled persons has been before\nthe court for more than ten years. See Society for Good Will for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 572 F.Supp.\n1300 (E.D.N.Y.1983); 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984); 103 F.R.D. 168 (E.D.N. Y.1984); 832 F.2d 245 (2d Cir.1987).\nThe court has continued to visit the institution and some of its small residential satellites, review reports of\ncertifying agencies and of the institution, hold evidentiary hearings and discuss ongoing problems with counsel\nand administrative staff.\nEnormous improvements in conditions at the Center have resulted from the dedicated efforts of staff; support by\nthe state; and pressure of governmental agencies, including the courts, and counsel for both plaintiffs and\ndefendants. Nevertheless, severe institutional problems revealed in earlier opinions continue. As reflected in the\nmost recent hearings and reports of certifying agencies, the constitutional rights of clients to adequate physical\nand medical support are being violated. According to expert testimony credited by the court, there is loss of\ncapacity in residents as a result of inadequate facilities, treatment and habilitation. The institution fails to provide\nreasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints and minimally adequate\ntraining that credible expert testimony and the court find to be reasonably required. These failures constitute a\nviolation of the rights of clients. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 327, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2464, 73 L.Ed.2d\n28 (1982) (Blackmun J., concurring) (constitution requires training \"reasonably necessary to prevent a person's\npreexisting self-care skills from deteriorating because of his commitment (emphasis in original)); Clark v. Cohen,\n794 F.2d 79, 95-96 (3d Cir.1986),cert. denied,479 U.S. 962, 107 S.Ct. 459, 93 L.Ed.2d 404 (1986); Society for\nGoodwill to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1250 (2d Cir.1984).\n141 The court credits findings of various state and federal certifying agencies determining *141 that the institution is\nnot complying with applicable federal regulations designed to protect clients physically and medically. These\nexpert reports are trustworthy. See Rule 803(8)(B), (C) of the Federal Rules of Evidence; Beech Aircraft Corp. v.\nRainey, ___ U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988). These findings confirm the evidence received in\ncourt and the court's own observations that constitutional rights to minimum housing, food, medical treatment and\nhabilitation necessary to prevent client deterioration have not been met. In view of these findings of constitutional\nviolations and supporting oral findings made on the record, it is not necessary to determine whether specific\nfederal statutes are being violated.\n\nIt has been suggested by the Court of Appeals that prior consent by the state to a decree in this case may have\nconstituted a waiver of its eleventh amendment immunity under Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman,\n465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (eleventh amendment prohibits federal courts from imposing\ninjunctive relief against state officials for violations of state law). See Society for Goodwill for Retarded Children,\nInc. v. Cuomo, 832 F.2d 245, 246 (2d Cir. 1987). See also Kozlowski v. Coughlin, 871 F.2d 241, 244 (2d Cir.1989)\n. This court respectfully declines to follow that suggestion. As a matter of fact, no intentional waiver occurred.\nImplied waivers are not desirable in circumstances such as are reflected in the present litigation because they\nwould make cooperative stipulations by the state less likely, reduce the number of consent decrees and induce\nlitigation to the death by the defendant in an increased number of cases.\nThe plaintiffs have sought a master to supervise the institution. Such an appointment is not desirable under the\ncircumstances of this case. The director and staff of the institution are fully committed to improvement and need\nno supervision. The state has been relatively forthcoming in its budgetary allocations, considering all the other\nfiscal demands it must meet.\nThe administrative limitations on the institution make it apparent that the constitutional rights of clients cannot be\nprotected without further reduction of the client population. All agree that this reduction should, for generally\naccepted professional reasons, be accomplished by transferring as many clients as is practicable to small home-\nlike cottages, houses and apartments; if possible these small residences should be off-campus, in the\ncommunity. Community placement to the extent reasonable under the circumstances is a necessary remedial\nmeasure to vindicate the clients' constitutional entitlements. The court has the power and obligation to require\nremedial steps designed to overcome the effect of years of severe constitutional deprivations experienced by\nclients of the Center. Cf. United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 1073, 94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987)\n(\"`Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable powers to remedy past\nwrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.'\") (quoting Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1275, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); United States v. Yonkers\nBd. of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1235-36 (2d Cir.1987),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 108 S.Ct. 2821, 100 L.Ed.2d 922\n(1988).\nThe following is ordered after detailed consultation on terms among counsel, administrative staff of the institution\nand the court:\n1. The policies and actions of the defendants in the operation of the Long Island Developmental Center are\ndeclared to be in continuing violation of the plaintiff class members' rights under the due process and equal\nprotection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n2. Defendants shall implement the following plan at LIDC (including the Sagtikos and Sagamore units):\n142 *142\nGOAL I: To Assure Proper Programming, Particularly for those Over the Age of 21\n         Not Educated in the Public School System\n        -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n              OBJECTIVE                                       ACTIONS\n1.

Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 572 F.Supp. 1300\n(E.D.N.Y.1983). They now move for counsel fees pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976.\n42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n996 Although a hearing on this matter would have provided helpful insights into the relevant *996 realities of current\nlaw practice and its economics, this motion is decided on written submission on the request of all parties. Cf. \nWilliams v. Alioto, 625 F.2d 845, 849 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (no requirement of evidentiary hearing for section\n1988 fee determination), cert. denied,450 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981); Konczak v. Tyrrell,\n603 F.2d 13, 19 (7th Cir.1979) (affidavits and briefs are adequate to decide fee issue), cert. denied,444 U.S.\n1016, 100 S.Ct. 668, 62 L.Ed.2d 646 (1980); City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 469-70 (2d Cir.1974) (\nGrinnell I) (in equitable fund cases the \"court should typically take pains to allow a complete airing of all\nobjections to a petitioner's fee claim\").\nI. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs filed this action in August of 1978. There followed numerous motions and hearings and a twenty-one\nday trial in 1982. See Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, 572 F.Supp. at 1353, for a detailed procedural\nhistory. The docket sheet's 296 entries provide some indication of the enormous work required of counsel. More\nthan fifty witnesses were heard and over 300 exhibits received.\nDuring the entire litigation Mr. Murray B. Schneps has represented plaintiffs. He was plaintiffs' sole counsel until\nMarch 1982, approximately one month before the start of trial. At that time Mr. Michael S. Lottman joined him as\ntrial counsel.\nMr. Schneps is a sole practitioner with his office in Manhattan. He has been practicing law for twenty years. For\nthe last fourteen years he has worked extensively in litigation involving the legal rights of the handicapped.\nAmong other cases, Mr. Schneps participated in the Willowbrook litigation. New York State Association for\nRetarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 393 F.Supp. 715 (E.D.N.Y.1975).\nMr. Lottman is also experienced in this type of litigation. He serves as a hearing master for the Federal District\nCourt in Philadelphia for the Penhurst case. Halderman v. Penhurst State School and Hospital, 612 F.2d 84 (3rd\n\nCir.1979),rev'd and remanded,451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981),on remand, 673 F.2d 647\n(3rd Cir.1982). He was admitted to the bar in 1969 and for the past ten years has concentrated his practice in the\nfield of the legal rights of the handicapped, especially mentally disabled persons.\nBoth Mr. Schneps and Mr. Lottman represented their clients with extraordinary skill and tenacity. This case was\nstrongly contested by the State of New York. In the preliminary stages the state was represented by the well\nknown New York firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby and MacRae. During the trial defendants were represented by\nthree or more Assistant Attorney Generals.\nII. PREVAILING PARTY\nIn civil rights actions \"the Court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee as\npart of the costs.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \"The purpose of section 1988 is to ensure `effective access to the judicial\nprocess' for persons with civil rights grievances.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 76\nL.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 1 (1976)). Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties. They have\nobtained substantial relief from this Court on almost all issues. See Society for Good Will to Retarded Children,\n572 F.Supp. 1352 (E.D.N.Y.1983). The threshold statutory requirement that they prevail on some aspect of their\nclaim for relief has been met. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, 103 S.Ct. at 1939.\nIII. COMPUTATION OF FEES\nThe statute requires fixing of a \"reasonable attorney's fee\". 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Computation begins with a\ndetermination of the number of hours reasonably expended by the prevailing party's counsel; that number is then\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40; \n997 Cohen v. West Haven Bd. of Police Commissioners, 638 F.2d 496, *997 505 (2d Cir.1980); City of Detroit v.\nGrinnell Corp., 560 F.2d 1093 (2d Cir.1977) (Grinnell II) (\"lodestar\" approach); City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp.,\n495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir.1974) (Grinnell I). See generally 2 M. Derfner & A. Wolf, Court Awarded Attorney Fees ¶ 16\n(1983). The Court may then adjust this figure to compensate counsel for factors such as risk, quality of\nrepresentation and results obtained. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 103 S.Ct. at 1940; New York Association for\nRetarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, (\"NYSARC\"), 711 F.2d 1136, 1153 (2d Cir.1983).\nBased on the legislative history of section 1988 the Supreme Court has indicated that the following factors should\nbe considered in determining a fee:\n(1) the time and labor required;\n(2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions;\n(3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;\n(4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case;\n(5) the customary fee;\n(6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent;\n(7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances;\n(8) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n(9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys;\n(10) the \"undesirability\" of the case;\n(11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and\n(12) awards in similar cases.\n\nHensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937 n. 3, 76 L.Ed.2d 40. While all these factors have not\nbeen referred to separately below, each has been considered in arriving at the final award.\nA. Hours\nPlaintiffs have submitted detailed affidavits in support of their claim for 3406.89 hours. Most of those hours\nrepresent work by Mr. Schneps (2747.89), with the remainder being hours of Mr. Lottman (659). In general the\naffidavits of both attorneys identify the date, nature of the work done, and hours worked in conformity with this\ncircuit's requirements. See NYSARC,711 F.2d 1136, 1147-48.\nFor the period May through June of 1978, Mr. Schneps does not provide a breakdown for the work done. He\nclaims 20.5 hours to \"review questionnaires, information and documents, research and general organization of\ncomplaint.\" Again for July of 1978, he claims 38.5 hours for \"research, telephone calls, drafts and preparation of\ncomplaint.\" The NYSARC requirement of specific documentation, however, applies only to work done after the\ndate of that opinion, June 15, 1983. Moreover, this amount of time, 59 hours, is negligible. It is entirely\nreasonable as measured by the documents and other preparatory work required during this period.\nAt all stages of this case plaintiffs' lawyers have kept their hours remarkably low. They were able to proceed with\nonly one or two lawyers. The total number of hours claimed, 3406.89, is entirely reasonable, especially in\ncomparison to those in similar class action cases challenging conditions at institutions for the mentally disabled. \nSee NYSARC,711 F.2d 1136, 1147-48 (in similar class action challenging conditions at state facility for the\nmentally retarded district court allowed 11,034 hours and denied 5377 hours for work of eight lawyers; Second\nCircuit upheld with exception of 322 hours); Association for Retarded Citizens v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. 495, 501,\n502, 508 (D.N.D.1982) (allowing over 5000 hours in class action challenging conditions and treatment of mentally\nretarded persons). As the Supreme Court has noted, \"[c]ases may be overstaffed\". Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___\nU.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40. This one was not.\n1. Travel Time\nPlaintiffs seek compensation for 104.75 hours for time Mr. Lottman spent traveling from Washington, D.C. and\nPhiladelphia to New York. Mr. Lottman resides in Washington, D.C. and conducts most of his business in\n998 Philadelphia. His participation *998 in this case as trial counsel along with Mr. Schneps required travel. The\ndefendants urge that this time is not properly charged to them.\nThere is no consensus on the point. One court has allowed full compensation for time spent in travel. See \nChrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., 509 F.Supp. 442, 454-55 (N.D.Ind.1981) (Title VII class action), aff'd in relevant part,\n670 F.2d 760 (7th Cir. 1982),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 2428, 77 L.Ed.2d 2428 (1983). Some courts\nhave refused to award any time for travel. See Thomas v. Board of Education, 505 F.Supp. 102, 104\n(N.D.N.Y.1981); NAACP v. Bell, 448 F.Supp. 1164, 1168 (D.D.C. 1978),rev'd on other grounds, 609 F.2d 514\n(1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 922, 100 S.Ct. 3012, 65 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1980). Several courts have granted\ncompensation, but at a lower rate than that allowed for activities such as court appearances and research. See \nDunten v. Kibler, 518 F.Supp. 1146, 1152 & n. 5 (N.D.Ga.1981); McPherson v. School District No. 186, 465\nF.Supp. 749 (S.D.Ill.1978); Keyes v. School District No. 1, 439 F.Supp. 393 (D.Colo.1977). The Second Circuit\nhas not addressed this issue.\nThe legislative history of section 1988 supports allowing compensation for lawyer's travel time. The Senate\nReport states that \"[i]n computing the fee, counsel for prevailing parties should be paid, as is traditional with\nattorneys compensated by a fee-paying client, `for all time reasonably expended on a matter.'\" S.Rep. No. 1011,\n94th Cong., 2d Sess. 6, reprinted in 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 5908, 5913 (1976) (quoting Stanford Daily\nv. Zurcher, 64 F.R.D. 680, 684 (N.D.Cal.1974)). Law firms generally bill their clients for travel time. Moreover, in\norder to effectuate the guiding purpose of the act, to enable private citizens to \"have a meaningful opportunity to\nvindicate\" their rights, S.Rep. No. 1011 at 2, 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News at 5910, plaintiffs must be able to\nhire experienced attorneys. Mr. Lottman is a specialist in the field of the legal rights of the mentally disabled. His\n\nparticipation enabled plaintiffs to obtain necessary expertise in the area. Using such out-of-town specialists may\nsave money since the expert will not waste time pursuing fruitless theories. See Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., 509\nF.Supp. 442, 455 (granting attorneys fees for travel time \"will allow attorneys of special skill ... to provide their\nskills in areas not within their immediate geographical reach\").\nThe court takes judicial notice of the fact that current practice is for lawyers to charge their clients for travel time\nrequired by their legal work. See Rule 201, Federal Rules of Evidence. Generally the lawyer will spend time in\ntransit working on the litigation. See Chrapliwy, 509 F.Supp. 442, 454-55. The Court assumes that Mr. Lottman,\nas do most lawyers, spends his time traveling preparing for his court appearances. It is said that a lawyer argues\nthree cases: one while traveling to court reflecting on what he or she will do, one while actually in court, and\nanother after leaving court, ruminating on what should have been said and deciding how to repair any errors.\nNevertheless, to grant the full amount for the time Mr. Lottman spent in traveling is unreasonable. The time he\nspent in transit may have been beneficial, but it probably was not as productive as time at the office or in court. \nSee Keyes v. School District No. 1, 439 F.Supp. 393, 409; cf. Cohen v. West Haven Board of Police\nCommissioners, 638 F.2d 496, 505 (2d Cir. 1980) (\"a different rate of compensation may well be set for different\ntypes of litigation tasks\"). Although attorneys may well charge private clients for all travel time, in view of the\ninefficiencies involved, the award in this civil rights case will be for 50% of the travel hours at the full rate. See \nKeyes, 439 F.Supp. at 409-10.\n2. Press Conferences\nPlaintiffs claim 9 2/6 hours for communications with newspapers and television stations and for press\nconferences. There is no precedent for awarding fees for such work. These are not hours \"expended on the\n999 litigation.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart,*999 ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 40. Although press\ncoverage may have helped plaintiffs' case, this was not legal work recoverable under section 1988. Accordingly,\ncompensation for the 9 2/6 hours spent in communication with the press is denied.\n3. Filing, Delivery and Service\nPlaintiffs include in their request for attorney's fees, 23 hours for filing, delivery, and service of papers. As with the\npress contacts, this time does not properly belong in the category of legal work for which a premium rate may be\nsought. It does not require a highly skilled lawyer to file papers. See Rajender v. University of Minnesota, 546\nF.Supp. 158, 166 (D.Minn.1932). This work is normally subsumed within an attorney's overhead. These 23 hours\nare denied.\n4. Excessive Time\nDefendants object to several of Mr. Schnepps's daily claims as containing an excessive amount of hours. They\nspecifically point to several days when Mr. Schneps seeks compensation for over fourteen and up to eighteen\nhours. These days are close to the March 1982 trial. The amount of time is not unreasonable for a conscientious\nlawyer, especially when that lawyer does not have assistance of associates, but must do all the preparatory work\nhimself. Mr. Schneps's courtroom work clearly revealed that he was working long hours.\nDefendants also assert that plaintiffs should not be compensated for hours spent pursuing unsuccessful\ndiscovery motions and rearguing a few court rulings. Plaintiffs have obtained excellent results in the case and\nshould not be penalized for a few minor tactical losses along the way. In Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103\nS.Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, the Court held that\n[w]here a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory\nfee. In these circumstances the fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff\nfailed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit.\n\nDefendants request trimming of \"the fat\", see NYSARC,711 F.2d 1136, 1146, from plaintiffs' claim by reducing\nthe total number of hours by a percentage. Their request assumes there is fat to be trimmed. In NYSARC, the\nSecond Circuit approved Judge Bartels's use of percentage cut as a realistic way of eliminating excessive hours\nfrom a voluminous fee application. Id. In this case, the few troublesome claims have been eliminated or reduced.\nThere is no basis for further reductions.\nThe contentions of defendants raise once again the serious reservations which have been entertained by trial\ncourts and others about excessive reliance upon the lodestar approach. Perhaps it is time to reconsider the\nmatter in light of recent developments in law and practice which tend to minimize the importance of the total\nhours worked in favor of other factors. In Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d\n40, for example, the Court emphasized that a party submitting a claim under section 1988 should use \"billing\njudgment\" in assessing his or her total hours. The Court also emphasized the importance of \"results obtained\" in\ndetermining the final fee award. Id. at 1940.\nThe 1983 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure put attorneys on notice that excessive discovery\nhours should not be permitted. See generally, Communication from the Chief Justice of the United States, House\nDoc. No. 54, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); P. Rothstein, The New Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure (1983); National Conference on Discovery Reform, Conference Proceedings, 3 Rev. of Litigation 1\n(1982). It is now understood that discovery procedures using associates and paraprofessionals without adequate\ncontrol by senior litigation partners can build up cost of litigation unnecessarily. Computation of fees on an hourly\nbasis may encourage wasteful inflation and abuse of discovery. Clients are increasingly becoming more\n1000 sophisticated *1000 about the costs of legal services and are paying more attention to the results they obtain\nthan hours logged. Billing practice is beginning to reflect that return to older virtues and good sense. See, e.g.,\nBrill, Fickle Fees, American Lawyer 1 (September 1983).\nAs this case demonstrates, attorneys with great expertise may obtain excellent results without running up an\ninordinate number of hours with the aid of large staffs. Their fee should reflect their ability to save hours; they\nshould not be penalized for being efficient.\nB. Rate\nPlaintiffs seek compensation at $175 per hour for the time of both Mr. Schneps and Mr. Lottman. The proper\nhourly rate to be applied in a section 1988 attorneys fees application is one \"normally charged for similar work by\nattorneys of like skill in the area.\" Cohen v. West Haven Board of Police Commissioners, 638 F.2d 496, 505 (2d\nCir.1980) (quoting City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 560 F.2d 1093, 1098 (2d Cir.1977)). That amount should not\nproduce a windfall to the attorneys. See New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d\n1136, 1149. In the case of non-profit organizations, fees should be calculated under the like skill standard up to\nthe \"break point\" when a higher fee would provide such a windfall. Id. at 1152.\nDefendants claim that to compensate the lawyers in this case at $175 an hour would provide a windfall and in\naddition they assert that Mr. Lottman falls into the category of a public interest lawyer governed by the standards\nset forth in NYSARC. NYSARC, however, dealt with non-profit organizations, the Legal Aid Society, and the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union. Id. at 1154. Mr. Lottman was not employed by such an organization for work on\nthis case. He was associated with an independent attorney. He paid his secretary separately and did much of his\nwork out of Mr. Schneps's office. For purposes of this case, he must be deemed a sole practitioner.\nMr. Schnepps's regular hourly rate was $100 in 1978, $125 in 1980, and currently it is $150. He seeks\ncompensation at the rate of $175 per hour because of the contingent nature of this litigation and because of its\ncomplexity. Mr. Lottman does not have a \"regular\" rate. He works as a court-appointed hearing master in\nPhiladelphia at a salary of $50,000 a year. He too seeks compensation at $175 per hour.\nPlaintiffs submitted affidavits asserting that $175-225 per hour is the rate lawyers of comparable skill to that of Mr.\nSchneps and Mr. Lottman would command. For the period 1978 through March 31, 1980 defendants paid LeBoef\n\npartners at the rate of $100 per hour and associates at $75 per hour; for the remaining period of 1980 they billed\nrespectively at $135 and $95 per hour. Since then rates have risen.\nThe court has considered all the information provided by the parties as well as general knowledge of prevailing\nrates in the New York legal community. The current reasonable rate of compensation for both Mr. Schneps's and\nMr. Lottman's time is $150 per hour.\nPlaintiffs' lawyers did not have the assistance of associates or paralegals, but did all the work themselves. It is\nurged that not all of their time should be compensated at the relatively high $150 per hour rate because they\ncould have used assistants at lower rates.\nWere this a large firm submitting a claim for legal services under section 1988, smaller per hour fees for\nassociate and paralegal services would be expected. Use of such assistants does sometimes reduce litigation\ncosts. Legal publications and court decisions increasingly recognize the important role the use of\nparaprofessionals plays in reducing legal costs. See, e.g., Pacific Coast Agricultural Export Association v. Sunkist\nGrowers, Inc., 526 F.2d 1196, 1210 (9th Cir.1975),cert. denied,425 U.S. 959, 96 S.Ct. 1741, 48 L.Ed.2d 204\n1001 (1976) (\"As a matter of policy, the use of paralegal help ... greatly reduces the cost of legal services *1001 to the\npublic and is thus a practice to be encouraged.\"); Pollack, How Paralegals Pay Off Big, American Lawyer (March\n1983) (\"Using paralegals instead of associates for ... routine assignments will help hold client bills down, and ...\nmay be the key to competing successfully during difficult economic times.\"); Use of Paralegals Makes Good\nBusiness Sense, 69 A.B.A.J. 1626 (1983); see generally 2 M. Derfner & A. Wolf, Court Awarded Attorney Fees ¶\n16.02 (1983).\nArguing against a reduction of average hourly rates is the fact that utilizing highly skilled individual practitioners\nmay have time-savings benefits. With expert knowledge, a lawyer can go directly to material it might take a junior\nassociate or paralegal many hours to find. In this case the Court's own observation of plaintiffs' counsel suggests\nthat they were able to substantially reduce time expenditures by calling on their extensive experience gained by\nparticipating in similar large class actions challenging conditions of institutions for the mentally retarded.\nEach case must be decided on its own facts. In this case the actual costs of litigation were reduced by plaintiffs'\nattorneys expertise and by their doing all the work without assistance.\nIn New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136 (2d Cir.1983), the Second Circuit\nheld that in some cases lasting over three years, a court must analyze the case in two phases, awarding historic\nrates for the early phase. Id. at 1153. This case began in 1978.\nAccordingly, this Court awards $100 per hour for Mr. Schneps's time from the filing of the complaint through the\nend of 1980, and $150 per hour for his remaining time. See id. ($50 per hour for 1972-1977 and $75 per hour for\n1977-1983). Mr. Lottman's work was all done in 1982 and 1983; all his time is compensated at the $150 per hour\nrate.\nC. Multiplier\nIn a civil rights case, the court may adjust the prevailing party's fee upward to compensate counsel for \"`the risk\nand complexity of the case, the results achieved and the superior advocacy of counsel.'\" NYSARC,711 F.2d\n1136, 1153 (quoting NYSARC, 544 F.Supp. 330, 342 (E.D.N.Y.1982)). See also Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S.\n___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (results obtained); Beazer v. New York City Transit Authority, 558 F.2d\n97, 100 (2d Cir.1977) (complexity and benefits to clients), reversed on other grounds,440 U.S. 568, 99 S.Ct.\n1355, 59 L.Ed.2d 587 (1979). The Supreme Court recently has emphasized the factor of \"results obtained\" in\nadjusting a fee award under section 1988. Eckerhart, 103 S.Ct. at 1940.\nApplying these criteria, plaintiffs' counsel plainly deserve a bonus. Initiation of the suit itself improved conditions\nat the Suffolk Developmental Center. See Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, 572 F.Supp. 1351\n(E.D.N.Y.1983). The Court's final decree granted plaintiffs extensive relief and the plan implemented by the\ndecree will result in better treatment and care for the members of the plaintiff class.\n\nUnder the risk and complexity factor, plaintiffs are also entitled to some increase in their base fee. As in the\nWillowbrook case, see NYSARC,711 F.2d at 1153, this case involved difficult and novel questions of\nconstitutional law. Finally, plaintiffs' lawyers are not non-profit lawyers subject to NYSARC's prohibition of a bonus\nfor risk. See id. at 1154-55.\nMr. Schneps is an attorney for whom compensation for risk is particularly appropriate. He is a sole practitioner\nwho has spent much of his time during the past five years on this case. Undoubtedly he had to forego other\nemployment while all his energies were so engaged. He risked a great deal in prosecuting this matter.\nBased on these considerations a multiplier of 1.25 is equitable. Such an award comports with those in\ncomparable cases in this circuit. See NYSARC,711 F.2d at 1154 (1.10); Vulcan Society v. Fire Department, 533\n1002 F.Supp. 1054, 1066 (S.D.N. *1002 Y.1982) (1.5); Ross v. Saltmarsh, 521 F.Supp. 753, 770-72 (S.D.N.Y.1981),\naff'd without opinion,688 F.2d 816 (2d Cir. 1982) (1.25); Stenson v. Blum, 512 F.Supp. 680, 685 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd\nwithout opinion,671 F.2d 493 (2d Cir.1981),cert. granted, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 2426, 77 L.Ed.2d 1314 (1983)\n(1.5); Population Services International v. Carey, 476 F.Supp. 4, 12 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (1.5).\nA 1.25 multiplier is quite modest in light of the excellent work done by plaintiffs' attorneys, the results they\nobtained, and the risks they undertook. While somewhat unfair to plaintiffs' counsel, it is appropriate to consider\nthat indirectly litigation funds are deductible from funds available for actual treatment and care of the mentally\nretarded. A court should not reduce an attorney's fee award because one party is a governmental agency, but it\nmay consider the wealth of the parties in setting the fee. See Cohen v. West Haven Board of Police\nCommissioners, 638 F.2d 496, 505 (2d Cir.1980). The defendant is not without resources, but the many demands\non its funds for public purposes suggest that litigation costs should be reduced to the minimum consonant with\nfairness to plaintiffs' counsel. Those lawyers who become involved in cases such as this one do not do so for\neconomic gain; rather their work reflects compassion for those in plaintiffs' position. They need and deserve to be\npaid for their efforts. But a balance must be struck between compensating the attorneys for their excellent work\nand refraining from exhausting available state monies.\nD. Expenses\nIn civil rights cases the prevailing party may recover all reasonable expenses. Jones v. Diamond, 636 F.2d 1364,\n1382 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. dismissed,453 U.S. 950, 102 S.Ct. 27, 69 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1981); Northcross v.\nBoard of Education, 611 F.2d 624, 639-40 (6th Cir.1979),cert. denied,447 U.S. 911, 100 S.Ct. 2999, 64 L.Ed.2d\n862 (1980); cf. Keyes v. School No. 1, 439 F.Supp. 393, 416-17 (D.Colo.1977) (only allow those costs provided\nfor under 28 U.S.C. § 1920).\n1. Travel, meals, hotels\nDefendants assert that plaintiffs' expense claims are unreasonable, pointing specifically to Mr. Lottman's train\nfares, and some meal, hotel and taxi bills. The train fares are reasonable for the same reason Mr. Lottman's\ntravel time is billable. See supra. See also Northcross, 611 F.2d at 639; McPherson v. School District No. 186,\n465 F.Supp. 749, 763 (both allowing travel expenses). In general the meal and hotel expenses fall into the same\ncategory as travel expenses. Several claims are, however, somewhat high 00 though no higher than that usually\n97\ncharged to clients by senior attorneys. Rather than reexamine each individual meal, hotel or taxi claim, the Court\nfinds that a reduction of 10% from the travel, meal and hotel claims eliminates any possible excessive expenses. \nSee McPherson, 465 F.Supp. at 763 (15% cut in travel and phone expenses); cf. NYSARC,711 F.2d 1136, 1146\n(percentage cut in hours).\n2. Secretarial expenses\nPlaintiffs seek reimbursement for special secretarial services in the amount of $384. Secretarial services are part\nof overhead expenses and are not generally charged to clients. Part of the reason lawyers receive a premium\n\nrate is to pay for such expenses. NYSARC,711 F.2d 1136, 1150. See also Hild v. Bruner, 496 F.Supp. 93, 100\n(D.N.J.1980) (clerical expenses \"must be subsumed under counsel's hourly rate for services\").\nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs are prevailing parties and are entitled to attorney's fees. They are to submit a judgment for fees and\ncosts in accordance with this opinion with 5 days notice to the defendants.\nSO ORDERED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Defendants.\nNo. 78-CV-1847 (JBW).\nUnited States District Court, E.D. New York.\nJanuary 27, 1987.\n551167 *516*517 Scheinberg, Schneps, DePetris & DePetris, Riverhead, N.Y. by Michael S.

Adler, Albany, N.Y., for the Office of Mental Retardation & Developmental Disabilities.\nMEMORANDUM and ORDER\nWEINSTEIN, Chief Judge.\nI. HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS\nA class action was commenced in 1978 by the Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc., the parents'\norganization at Suffolk Developmental Center (the Center), and by thirteen mentally retarded individuals on\nbehalf of themselves and more than 1,500 other persons then in residence at, or on the rolls of, the Center.\nPlaintiffs sought, on various federal constitutional and state and federal statutory grounds, (1) the improvement of\nconditions at the Center, (2) the expansion of community resources and support services in Nassau and Suffolk\ncounties for the mentally retarded and for their families and (3) transfer of most of the clients at the Center to\nsmall community residences.\nDefendants, sued in their official capacity, are the Governor of the State of New York and the personnel of the\nNew York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. Jurisdiction is not disputed. 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343.\nThe Center is a state-run residential institution for the mentally retarded on 465 acres in Melville, Long Island,\nNew York. The history of the Center and its problems are fully described in published opinions. See, e.g., Society\nfor Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 572 F.Supp. 1298, 572 F.Supp. 1300 (E.D.N.Y.1983), vacated\nand remanded,737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984). While the census at the Center has been reduced by a variety of\nmeans, including setting up small community residences, it remains one of the largest in the nation.\nIn February of 1983 the Court, after an extensive trial and repeated visits to the institution, issued an interim\nmemorandum finding that conditions and treatment at the Center failed to meet the minimum standards required\nby the Constitution and statutes. As modified that plan was embodied in this court's decree of August 3, 1983. \nSociety for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 572 F.Supp. 1300 (E.D.N.Y.1983),vacated and remanded,\n737 F.2d. 1239 (2d Cir.1984).\nWhile the case was on appeal, the Supreme Court sharply curtailed the power of federal courts to require\nchanges in state institutions based upon the enforcement of state law. See Pennhurst State School & Hospital v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v.\nCuomo, 737 F.2d at 1252. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for further consideration and,\n\nmore particularly, for findings on the particular federal 00 not state 00 statutes and constitutional violations present. \n97 97\nSee Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984).\nSuch findings proved unnecessary since after remand the state voluntarily agreed to enforce the plan already\napproved by the court. The case was therefore dismissed as moot. The court noted, however, that \"[i]f the\ndefendants substantially depart from the implementation of the plan and conditions at the facility violate federal\nlaw, this Court will reinstate the case since the issues remanded by the Circuit would no longer be moot.\" Society\nfor Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 103 F.R.D. 168, 169 (E.D.N.Y.1984). Annual reports by the\ninstitution to the court were required.\nIn 1985, the court revisited the institution. Being satisfied of reasonable and largely successful efforts to carry out\nthe plan, the court terminated the obligation for further reports.\n518 *518 Plaintiffs now move to reinstate the case. They allege continuing serious violations of federal constitutional\nand statutory rights. More particularly, they point to an order of the New York Department of Social Services\nimposing sanctions on the institution for what plaintiffs characterize as \"extensive and continuing violations of the\nFederal requirements for participation in the Medicaid program as an intermediate case facility for the mentally\nretarded....\" See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, 1396d(c), 1396d(d), 42 C.F.R. §§ 442.400 et seq. Plaintiffs also move for the\nappointment of a master to oversee implementation of the plan.\nUpon argument of the motions the court orally expressed the view that the motions should be denied. It was the\ncourt's then view that the decision in Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct.\n900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), required that it either bifurcate the case to exclude all state issues, or that it abstain\nfrom exercising jurisdiction over the federal claims in order that a single action on both state and federal claims\nmight be brought in state court. Since complex issues of fact underly both the state and federal issues, bifurcating\nthe case would, the court then believed, result in wasteful duplication of scarce federal and state judicial\nresources and unnecessarily burden the administrators of the Center with the defense of possible multiple\nlawsuits, thereby draining their time and energies away from the urgent task of implementing the plan. Moreover,\nbifurcation might unduly delay effective relief, as the case would have to wind its way consecutively through two\ncourt systems, with the distinct possibility of reversals, remands and bouncing back and forth between two sets of\ncourts and a variety of administrative agencies 00 both state and federal.\n97\nFurther reflection suggests that while abstention has substantial benefits in meeting the dilemmas posed by \nPennhurst, the dangers of this approach may be too great. The most important of these dangers is posed by the\nclosing 00 even temporarily 00 of federal courthouses to those in state institutions who claim a violation of both\n97 97\nfederal and state rights; state courts are now the only forum in which all claims 00 state and federal 00 can be tried\n97 97\nin one proceeding. If federal courts have any overriding reason for being, it is as a source of protection to any\nperson who believes there is a serious violation of his or her federal constitutional rights 00 particularly by\n97\ngovernment officials. The institutionalized mentally disabled are especially prone to abuse unless they can turn to\nthe federal courts for protection. See, e.g., Bowen v. City of New York, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d\n462 (1986); City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313\n(1985).\nIt is doubtful whether the New York State courts, overburdened as they are, can operate with sufficient speed and\nefficiency to protect the federal rights of these plaintiffs and simultaneously protect their state rights. The choice\nby plaintiffs of the federal court 00 even though the state court could in one suit enforce both state and federal\n97\nrights 00 suggests that they believe that the federal courts provide them with some advantages over the state\n97\ncourts. Finally, in this case, the long relationship of this court to the litigation and to the institution provides some\nhope for a reduction of the fact and law finding burdens of this new phase of the litigation.\nTo understand the difficult jurisdictional choices posed by a litigation of this kind, it is necessary to briefly review\nthe pre- and post-Pennhurst situation. It is to this history that we now turn.\nII. PENDENT JURISDICTION AND ABSTENTION DOCTRINES\n\nEffect and Background of Pennhurst\nIn Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), the Court\nheld that the Eleventh Amendment was a bar to federal courts hearing claims against state officials based upon\n519 state law. \"[A] federal suit against state officials on the basis of *519 state law contravenes the Eleventh\nAmendment when 00 as here 00 the relief sought and ordered has an impact directly on the State itself.\" \n97 97\nPennhurst, 465 U.S. at 117, 104 S.Ct. at 917. Accepting federal funds to run the institution does not constitute a\nwaiver of this constitutional bar. Atascadero v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3149-50, 87 L.Ed.2d 171\n(1985).\nPendent Jurisdiction\nWhen this case was tried in 1983 it was appropriate, based upon the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, for this\ncourt to hear both state and federal claims. Since the state and federal claims were intertwined and based upon\nthe same factual issues, taking jurisdiction was appropriate. A federal court has the power to exercise jurisdiction\nover state claims when they are close enough to a substantial federal question claim that the court \"would\nordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\" United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715,\n725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).\nThe doctrine of pendent jurisdiction flows from Osborn v. Bank of United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 6 L.Ed.\n204 (1824). Relying on Article III of the Constitution, the Court there held that federal courts have authority to\ndetermine all questions of fact or law which arise in a suit, even those that go beyond the particular issue which\ngave rise to federal jurisdiction. See also Greene v. Louisville & Interurban Railroad Co., 244 U.S. 499, 508, 37\nS.Ct. 673, 677, 61 L.Ed. 1280 (1917) (federal court exercising federal question jurisdiction may decide state law\nquestions regardless of its determination of the federal question). Essentially this line of cases is based upon the\nneed for judicial efficiency and the avoidance of multiple litigation.\nExercise of pendent jurisdiction is, however, restricted by the Eleventh Amendment, which prohibits suits against\nstates. The Supreme Court has upheld exceptions to the Eleventh Amendment bar in cases of waiver and of\nabrogation of the states' immunity by Congress under its fourteenth amendment enforcement clause powers. A\nstate may explicitly waive its immunity. See, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1361, 39\nL.Ed.2d 662 (1974); Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447, 2 S.Ct. 878, 883, 27 L.Ed. 780 (1883). A finding of\nconstructive consent to be sued is not favored in Eleventh Amendment cases. See, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415\nU.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1361, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974); Employees of Department of Public Health & Welfare\nv. Missouri, 411 U.S. 279, 285-87, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1618-19, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973). The Court did find, however, a\nwaiver by implication from the commerce clause in Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Dep't,\n377 U.S. 184, 190-91, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 1212, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964).\nJurisdiction to hear claims against a state may be conferred on the federal courts by Congress when it abrogates\nthe states' immunity in legislation enacted pursuant to the enforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nSee Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 2771, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976). Abrogation of the\nEleventh Amendment requires \"unmistakable language in the statute itself.\" Atascadero State Hospital v.\nScanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3148, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985).

Feder).\nBefore Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), the\nEleventh Amendment bar was limited to a claim against a state as the named defendant, see, e.g., Missouri v.\nFiske, 290 U.S. 18, 26, 54 S.Ct. 18, 20-21, 78 L.Ed. 145 (1933),Osborn v. United States Bank, 22 U.S. (9\nWheat.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824), or where \"the state is the real, substantial party in interest.\" Ford Motor Co. v.\nDepartment of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 350, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945).\n520\n\n*520 The hand of the federal courts was strengthened with Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed.\n714 (1908), which held that the district court had jurisdiction to hear an action against a state official where the\nofficial acted ultra vires. Based on this notion the Eleventh Amendment issue was eroded to the vanishing point in\nmodern federal institutional reform litigation. Invariably it would be alleged that the state official was not acting\nwithin his statutory authority.\nThe federalism balance began to swing back to the state courts in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct.\n1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). There the Young doctrine was restricted to prospective actions for injunctive relief\nagainst state officials. Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d\n67 (1984), further restricted Young, calling it a \"fiction,\" needed only when it is necessary to promote the\nvindication of federal rights. 465 U.S. at 105, 104 S.Ct. at 911. The Court concluded in Pennhurst that\n[a] federal court's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of state law, whether\nprospective or retroactive, does not vindicate the supreme authority of federal law. On the\ncontrary, it is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court\ninstructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law. Such a result conflicts directly\nwith the principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.\n465 U.S. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911. Since Pennhurst, it has been clear that 00 absent an unambiguous\n97\nCongressional mandate under its Fourteenth Amendment powers 00 a federal district court does not have\n97\njurisdiction to hear the state claims in a case such as the one before us.\nPart of the problem with applying the Pennhurst decision lies in the fact that the law on the Eleventh Amendment\nhas so recently shifted that practice has not yet adjusted. The ground is still trembling from aftershocks. See,\ne.g., Bartels, Exceptional Circumstances: Quo Vadis? 60 St. John's L.Rev. 415 (1986); Address by Paul J.\nMishkin, Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley, Federal Judges Seminar (June 16, 1986) (judicial\nnotice taken; on file in Clerk's Office, U.S. D.C., E.D.N.Y.); Brown, Beyond Pennhurst: Protective Jurisdiction, the\nEleventh Amendment, and the Power of Congress to Enlarge Federal Jurisdiction in Response to the Burger\nCourt, 71 Va.L.

Halderman, 34 DePaul\nL.Rev. 515 (1985).\nPennhurst represented a sharp break with the prior practice in federal courts. In a case where federal\nconstitutional and state statutory issues were intertwined, pre-Pennhurst it was usual to rely upon state law rather\n521 than upon the federal constitution *521 in order to avoid the constitutional issue. As Justice Brandeis stated the\nSupreme Court's policy:\nThe Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record,\nif there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has\nfound most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one\ninvolving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law,\nthe Court will decide only the latter.\nAshwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring) (citations omitted).\n\nChoices for the District Court\nAs a result of Pennhurst, federal trial courts are left with the choice either to bifurcate the federal and state\nclaims, hearing only the federal claims in federal court, or to abstain. A practical equivalent of abstention is to stay\nthe federal proceedings while state proceedings (pending or prospective) go forward. The plaintiff, then, would\nhave the choice in state court of relying only on the state claims or of seeking to have all claims 00 both state and\n97\nfederal 00 heard together. Under the Supremacy Clause state courts would have to enforce both the state and\n97\nfederal claims. The Pennhurst Court recognized that \"[i]t may be that applying the Eleventh Amendment to\npendent claims results in federal claims being brought in state court, or in bifurcation of claims.\" 465 U.S. at 122,\n104 S.Ct. at 919-20.\nAbstention\nAn alternative to bifurcation is abstention. The federal court could refuse to hear the federal claim leaving the\nmatter for the state court. A possible option of plaintiff then would be to ask the state court to adjudicate only the\nstate claims. Following rejection of the state claims 00 and subject to res judicata and collateral estoppel bars\n97\ntouched upon below 00 the plaintiff could conceivably return to the federal courts for adjudication of the federal\n97\nclaim. There are difficulties with these approaches.\nThe federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise jurisdiction given to them.\" Colorado River\nWater Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1246, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). As\nChief Justice Marshall put it:\nIt is most true, that this court will not take jurisdiction if it should not: but it is equally true, that it\nmust take jurisdiction, if it should. The judiciary cannot, as the legislature may, avoid a measure,\nbecause it approaches the confines of the constitution.... With whatever doubts, with whatever\ndifficulties, a case may be attended, we must decide it, if it be brought before us. We have no\nmore right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not\ngiven. The one or the other would be treason to the constitution. Questions may occur, which we\nwould gladly avoid; but we cannot avoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our best judgment and\nconscientiously to perform our duty.\nCohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 404, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1824).\nPragmatic considerations of judicial efficiency as well as reasons of comity between court systems and\nfederalism principles led to some erosion of the Cohens rule and an expanding abstention doctrine. See Railroad\nCommission of Texas v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). Abstention is a \"judge-made\ndoctrine.\" Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 248, 88 S.Ct. 391, 395, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967). \"The doctrine of\nabstention, under which a District Court may decline to exercise or postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction, is an\nextraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.\" \nAllegheny v. Frank Mashuda Company, 360 U.S. 185, 188-89, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 1063, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959).\n522 *522 The Court of Appeals for this circuit has synthesized the Supreme Court's abstention adjudications as\ndelineating \"four relatively well-defined circumstances\" where abstention is appropriate. Texaco v. Pennzoil, 784\nF.2d 1133, 1147 (2d Cir.1986),rev'd,___ U.S. ___, 107 S.Ct. 1519, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (1987). See also, e.g., Law\nEnforcement Insurance Company, Ltd. v. Corcoran, 807 F.2d 38, 40 (2d Cir.1986); C.A. Wright, Law of the\nFederal Courts 303 (4th ed. 1983) (absention \"recognized: (1) to avoid decision of a federal constitutional\nquestion where the case may be disposed of on a question of state law; (2) to avoid needless conflict with the\nadministration by a state of its own affairs; (3) to leave to the states the resolution of unsettled questions of state\nlaw; and (4) to ease the congestion of the federal court docket\" when a similar action is pending in a state court).\n\n1. Pullman Abstention\nIn Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Company, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), the\nplaintiff sued to enjoin an order of the Texas Railroad Commission as discriminatory against blacks in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. A three judge district court enjoined enforcement of the order. The Supreme Court\nreversed, holding that the district court should have abstained or stayed the case pending proceedings in the\nTexas state courts to determine the meaning of the statute relied upon by the Commission. The Court stated:\n[The complaint] touches a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not\nto enter unless no alternative to its adjudication is open. Such constitutional adjudication plainly\ncan be avoided if a definitive ruling on the state issue would terminate the controversy.\n312 U.S. at 498, 61 S.Ct. at 644.\nThe Pullman doctrine rests on the desirability of avoiding unnecessary decisions of constitutional issues where\nthere is present an unclear issue of state law that, once decided, may make it unnecessary to decide a federal\nconstitutional question. See Harris County Commissioners Court v. Moore, 420 U.S. 77, 83, 95 S.Ct. 870, 875, 43\nL.Ed.2d 32 (1975); Lake Carriers' Association v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 509-512, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 1756-58, 32\nL.Ed.2d 257 (1972). The three essential conditions for Pullman abstention are:\nthat the state law be unclear or the issue of state law be uncertain, that resolution of the federal\nissue depend upon the interpretation to be given to the state law, and that the state law be\nsusceptible of an interpretation that would avoid or modify the constitutional issue.\nMcRedmond v. Wilson, 533 F.2d 757, 761 (2d Cir.1976) (citations omitted). See also Weiser v. Koch, 632 F.Supp.\n1369, 1383 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (abstention in a suit involving shelters for the homeless where federal court would\nhave had to determine state law currently undergoing development).\nNone of the essential elements for Pullman abstention are met in the case at bar. First, the state law is not\nunsettled. Second, resolution of the federal issues is not logically dependent on resolution of the state law issues.\nSee Accident Fund v. Baerwaldt, 579 F.Supp. 729, 730 (W.D. Mich.1984) (abstention where state law upon which\nfederal jurisdictional issue depended unclear). Whether plaintiffs are being denied their due process rights, as\nwell as whether conditions at the Long Island Developmental Center violate federal statutes are questions\nthat may be decided independently of any decision as to plaintiffs' rights under state law. It is not\nlogically necessary to decide the state law issues first, before reaching the constitutional claim; the\nconstitutional claim is alternative to, rather than dependent upon, the state law claims.\nCanaday v. Koch, 608 F.Supp. 1460, 1467 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub. nom. Canaday v. Valentin, 768 F.2d 501 (2d\nCir.1985). In this very litigation the Court of Appeals on its remand ordered the trial court to separate the state\n523 and federal issues and to decide the federal question without regard *523 to state law. See Society for Good Will\nto Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1252 (2d Cir.1984). Since the state law issues are not logically\npreliminary to the federal constitutional issue, the second requirement of the test for abstention is missing.\nThe third essential element is also not present: Resolution of the state claims will not necessarily preclude the\nnecessity to decide the federal issues. It is possible that no state laws are infringed upon, but that the federal\nconstitution or statutes are violated.\n2. Burford Abstention\nIn Burford v. Sun Oil Company, 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943), plaintiff Sun Oil brought a\nfederal court suit attacking an order of the Texas Railroad Commission which granted Burford the right to drill on\ncertain land for oil. The Court held that abstention was appropriate in these circumstances: The federal\ngovernment had left the responsibility for regulating the industry to the states; there was an effective state\nadministrative system; the legislature \"ha[d] established a system of thorough judicial review by its own State\n\ncourts\"; 319 U.S. at 325, 63 S.Ct. at 1103, and the state law on the issue was unsettled. The Court noted that the\n\"federal courts can make small contribution to [a] well organized [state] system of regulation and review....\" 319\nU.S. at 327, 63 S.Ct. at 1104.\nFederalism and comity concerns are reflected in Burford abstention. This type of abstention enables federal\ncourts to refrain from becoming involved with state policymaking and enforcement procedures in complex areas\nwhich are primarily the state's concern. In Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 79\nS.Ct. 1070, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1959), the Court held abstention by the district court proper in a case concerning the\nscope of the eminent domain power of municipalities under state law since the state law was unsettled. See also \nKaiser Steel Corp. v. W.S. Ranch Co., 391 U.S. 593, 88 S.Ct. 1753, 20 L.Ed.2d 835 (1968); Hawks v. Hamill, 288\nU.S. 52, 53 S.Ct. 240, 77 L.Ed. 610 (1933); but see County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U.S. 185,\n195, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 1067, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959) (abstention inappropriate where state law of eminent domain\nsettled). These cases primarily involve financial concerns, not life and liberty. Burford abstention is not useful in\nthe case at bar.\nEven the broad view of Burford abstention in Levy v. Lewis, 635 F.2d 960 (2d Cir.1980), cannot override the clear\nduty of federal district courts to protect the federal constitutional rights of incompetents held in a state institution. \nSee Quinn v. Aetna Life and Casualty Co., 616 F.2d 38, 41 (2d Cir.1980) (\"abstention cannot be ordered simply to\ngive state courts the first opportunity to vindicate\" a claim); cf. Naylor v. Case and McGrath, Inc., 585 F.2d 557,\n565 (2d Cir.1978) (abstention not proper where rendering federal decision will not \"be disruptive of the even\ndevelopment of state law\"). In Levy v. Lewis, 635 F.2d 960 (2d Cir.1980), plaintiff filed a claim in federal court\nagainst the state superintendent of insurance alleging misfeasance in the state's handling of an employee welfare\nbenefit plan. The federal court had jurisdiction under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1381. Affirming the district court's dismissal of the case, the Second Circuit held\nthat rather than dismiss for failure to state a claim, the court should have invoked the Burford abstention doctrine.\nThe Court of Appeals stated that Burford applies even when complex issues of state law are not present:\nAppellant argues, however, that this case is not governed by those decisions in which abstention\nwas ordered under Burford because most decisions applying Burford have involved complex\nissues of state law. We disagree. In Burford itself, violations of federal law were alleged. The\nclaims there amounted to an attack on the reasonableness of the state administrative action. Thus\nfederal review, while involving decision of a federal question, would have entailed a\n524 reconsideration *524 of the state administrative decision, carrying with it the potential for creating\ninequities in the administration of the state acheme. Burford thus suggests that proper respect for\nthe expertise of state officials and the expeditious and evenhanded administration of state\nprograms counsels restraint on the part of the federal courts.\nLevy v. Lewis, 635 F.2d 960, 964 (2d Cir. 1980).\nIn the instant case, where the lives and welfare of incompetents are involved, the Levy case is not controlling. We\nare not, as in Levy, concerned with \"the proper respect for the expertise of state officials and the expeditious and\nevenhanded administration of state programs.\" Id. at 964. Involved here are the futures of people incapable of\ncaring for themselves. \"Federal Courts have been reluctant to abstain when fundamental rights ... are involved.\" \nQuilici v. Village of Morton Grove, 695 F.2d 261, 265 n. 2 (7th Cir.1982).\nLevy is also distinguishable from the instant case because there both federal and state jurisdiction were invoked.\nHere only federal jurisdiction is relied upon.\n3. Younger Abstention\nIn Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), the Court held that, absent bad faith,\nharassment, or a patently invalid state statute, federal jurisdiction should not be invoked for the purpose of\nrestraining state criminal proceedings. This form of abstention also has been applied to cases involving state\nnuisance prosecutions which are directed at obtaining the closure of places exhibiting obscene films, see \nHuffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975) and to cases involving the\n\ncollection of state taxes. See Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed.\n1407 (1943). Abstention under Younger is inappropriate in the instant civil case brought to improve the lives of\nthe developmentally disabled.\n4. Colorado River Abstention\nColorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483\n(1976), involved the concurrent exercise of jurisdiction by both federal and state courts. The United States\nbrought an action in federal court against water users for a declaration of the government's rights to water in\ncertain rivers. The suit was brought under both federal and Colorado law. After the federal suit had been started,\none of the defendants filed another suit in Colorado state court on the same claims. Defendants then filed a\nmotion in federal court to dismiss on the ground of the McCarran Amendment, 43 U.S.C. § 666, which grants the\nUnited States' consent to be joined as a defendant in a suit for the adjudication of water rights. The Supreme\nCourt found that although this case did not fall within previously enumerated abstention doctrines, the district\ncourt's refraining from hearing the case was appropriate. However, the Court warned:\n[T]here are principles unrelated to considerations of proper constitutional adjudication and regard\nfor federal-state relations which govern in situations involving the contemporaneous exercise of\nconcurrent jurisdiction, either by federal courts or by state and federal courts. These principles rest\non considerations of \"[w]ise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation of judicial\nresources and comprehensive disposition of litigation.\"\nColorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1246, 47 L.Ed.2d\n483 (1976) (citations omitted).\nWhile declining to prescribe a hard and fast rule for dismissals in cases involving the exercise of concurrent\njurisdiction, the Court described the factors relevant to its decision:\n[T]he court first assuming jurisdiction over property may exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion\n525 of other courts.... [A] federal court may also consider ... the inconvenience of the federal forum; \n*525 the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation; and the order in which jurisdiction was\nobtained by the concurrent forums. No one factor is necessarily determinative; a carefully\nconsidered judgment taking into account both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the\ncombination of factors counselling against that exercise is required.\n424 U.S. at 818-19, 96 S.Ct. at 1246-47 (citations omitted). In Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury\nConstruction, 460 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983), the Supreme Court noted that its primary\nconcern in Colorado River was the narrow circumstance in which there is a clear indication of congressional\nintent that the federal and state issues be tried jointly by one court. See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v.\nMercury Construction, 460 U.S. 1, 16, 103 S.Ct. 927, 937, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).\nAbstention in the instant case does not come within the Colorado River abstention doctrine. There is neither a \nres, nor is there the concurrent exercise of federal and state jurisdiction.\nEach of the four abstention doctrines outlined above has been carefully circumscribed. None seriously erodes the\nclear policy that a federal court should not decline to accept cases within its jurisdiction. While not decisive, we\nnote that abstention in the instant case might cause serious issue preclusion and claim preclusion problems.\nClaim and Issue Preclusion\nOn the same day that Pennhurst was handed down, the Supreme Court ruled on a claim of the preclusive effect\nof a state-court judgment in the context of a subsequent federal suit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985. In Migra\nv. Warren City School District Board of Education, 465 U.S. 75, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984), the plaintiff\nfirst brought suit in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas where she did not litigate her federal claim. The Supreme\nCourt affirmed the district court's holding that her federal suit was barred by the state court judgment since her\n\nfederal claim could have been litigated in the state court proceeding. The court held that in section 1983 cases,\nas in other federal actions, the federal full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, gave the state-court\njudgment \"the same claim preclusive effect in federal court that the judgment would have\" in state court. 465 U.S.\nat 85, 104 S.Ct. at 898. See also University of Tennessee v. Elliott, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 3226-27, 92\nL.Ed.2d 635 (1986) (federal common law rule of preclusion bars relitigation of facts found by \"state administrative\nbodies acting in a judicial capacity\" when \"the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate\").\nAfter Pennhurst a litigant who wishes to join state law claims against a state official with federal claims must file in\nstate court. Procedurally, the litigant who wishes to preserve his federal claims for hearing in federal court must\nfirst file in federal court and, after that court abstains,\ninform the state courts that he is exposing his federal claims there only for the purpose of\ncomplying with [the requirement to inform the state court of his federal claims, so that the state law\ncan be construed in light of the federal claims], and that he intends, should the state courts hold\nagainst him on the question of state law, to return to the District Court for disposition of his federal\ncontentions. Such an explicit reservation is not indispensable; the litigant is in no event to be\ndenied his right to return to the District Court unless it clearly appears that he voluntarily did more\nthan [inform the court] and fully litigated his federal claims in the state courts. When the\nreservation has been made, however, his right to return will in all events be preserved.\nEngland v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 421-22, 84 S.Ct. 461, 468, 11 L.Ed.2d\n526 440 (1964). Unless this procedure is followed the litigant *526 can be precluded from bringing the action in\nfederal court. See Fay v. South Colonie Central School District, 802 F.2d 21, 28-31 (2d Cir.1986) (injunctive relief\non constitutional claims barred by res judicata because they could have been litigated in previous state court\nproceedings); see also Address by Paul J. Mishkin, Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley, Federal\nJudges Seminar (June 16, 1986) (judicial notice taken; on file in Clerk's Office, U.S.D.C., E.D.N.Y.) (discussing\npreclusive effects as a consequence of Pennhurst); Smith, Pennhurst v. Halderman: The Eleventh Amendment,\nErie and Pendent State Law Claims, 34 Buffalo L.Rev. 227, 272-88 (1985) (discussing problems of claim and\nissue preclusion when concurrent jurisdiction is exercised); Chemerinsky, State Soverignty and Federal Court\nPower: The Eleventh Amendment After Pennhurst v. Halderman, 12 Hastings Const.L.Q. 643, 658-59 (1985)\n(same); Shapiro, Wrong Turns: The Eleventh Amendment and the Pennhurst Case, 98 Harv.L. Rev. 61, 80-82\n(1984) (claim preclusion problems caused by confluence of Pennhurst and Migra). In effect, this procedural\nnecessity results in delays and additional use of court time.\nIssue preclusion occurs when an issue of fact or law was actually litigated and determined by a valid and final\njudgment. The determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a\ndifferent claim. In Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980), the Court held that the\nfederal full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, required that issue preclusion be applied in a federal section\n1983 suit to bar reconsideration of a state court's determination of the constitutionality of a search and seizure.\nSimilarly, when a federal court stays proceedings or abstains, forcing the case to be litigated first in state court,\nshould the federal claims thereafter come before a federal court, that court may be barred from relitigating issues\nalready heard by the state court.\nPower of Bifurcation\nBifurcation of claims between the federal and state courts is within the district court's discretionary power. As the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit has put the matter:\nIn exercising its discretion [to bifurcate a case] the district court will undoubtedly keep in mind that\na portion of [the] action must be brought in the federal court, that the district court and the parties\nhave already devoted considerable time and effort to the other incidents of alleged wrongdoing,\nthat bifurcation of the claims may be wasteful and that success on the pendent claims may afford\nplaintiffs substantially complete relief.\n\nMorrissey v. Curran, 567 F.2d 546, 549 (2d Cir.1977). Numerous post-Pennhurst courts have found the\nalternative of bifurcation acceptable, or even preferable, to abstention in Eleventh Amendment cases. See, e.g., \nAlmendral v. New York State Office of Mental Health, 743 F.2d 963, 968-69 (2d Cir.1984) (summary judgment on\nfederal claim reversed; pre-Pennhurst dismissal of state law claims affirmed on the basis of Pennhurst); Woe v.\nCuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 102, 106 (2d Cir.1984) (all claims dismissed by district court prior to decision in Pennhurst;\nfederal due process claim reinstated by Court of Appeals), cert. denied,469 U.S. 936, 105 S.Ct. 339, 83 L.Ed.2d\n274 (1985); Beaver v. Bridwell, 598 F.Supp. 90 (D.Md.1984); Hayward v. Thompson, 593 F.Supp. 57, 58-59\n(N.D.Ill. 1984); Wylie v. Kitchin, 589 F.Supp. 505, 510-11 (N.D.N.Y.1984); Everett v. Schramm, 587 F.Supp. 228,\n234-35 (D.Del. 1984),aff'd,772 F.2d 1114 (3d Cir.1985); Gelber v. Rozas, 584 F.Supp. 902, 904 (S.D. Fla.1984); \nJones v. Singer Career Systems, 584 F.Supp. 1253, 1258 (E.D.Ark. 1984); Diotte v. Blum, 585 F.Supp. 887, 897\n(N.D.N.Y.1984).\nThe court has considered the importance of the federal claims to members of the plaintiff class; the fact that the\n527 Court of Appeals has already held, in effect, that bifurcation here is practical when it demanded *527 a decision\non federal issues only; and the extensive experience of the court with the institution. These \"factors are `to be\napplied in a pragmatic, flexible manner with a view to the realities of the case at hand'\". Law Enforcement\nInsurance Co., Ltd. v. Corcoran, 807 F.2d 38, 44 (2d Cir. 1986). Weighing these and other relevant\nconsiderations, on balance, bifurcation is less objectionable than abstention.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs' claims should not be precluded. The federal courts are open to them.\nThe case should be conducted as a litigation independent from the case already in effect long closed.\nAccordingly, the clerk is directed to open a new file temporarily entitled \"In re Long Island Developmental Center\"\n00 the new name of the former Suffolk Developmental Center. No payment of fees shall be required since the\n97\ncourt takes judicial notice that the individual plaintiffs are substantially without funds.\nPlaintiffs' application for appointment of a special master to oversee implementation of the 1984 consent decree\nis denied. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits district courts in non-jury cases to name a\nspecial master in \"any action ... upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it.\" Since we deem\nplaintiffs' motion to reopen the complaint in a new action, a finding that exceptional conditions require the\nappointment of a special master would be premature. Cf., e.g., Levine, The Role of Special Master In Institutional\nReform Litigation, 1986 Law and Policy 275, 317 (collecting references).\nPlaintiffs shall have sixty days to serve a complaint. Defendants shall be deemed served with a summons and\ncomplaint in this new action by service of plaintiff's motion in 78 C 1847 returnable October 29, 1986. All papers\nfiled in 78 C 1847 on and after September 29, 1986 shall be transferred to the new file.\nSo ordered.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Basing its decision on\nNew York state law and the federal Constitution, the court found that the defendant officials of the State of New\nYork had maintained living conditions at the Suffolk Developmental Center (SDC) that failed to meet statutory and\nconstitutional standards. It ordered extensive changes in the operations and facilities at SDC and the community\nplacement of 400 SDC residents by 1987.\nIn Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984), we vacated the district\ncourt's order. We held that parts of the order could not be justified on federal constitutional grounds. We could not\ndiscern whether the remainder of the order was predicated on federal constitutional grounds or state law\ngrounds. Because the Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from granting state law relief in actions against\nstate officials, see Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67\n(1984), we remanded so that the district court could determine which parts of its order were mandated by the\n\nfederal Constitution. Finally, because the district court did not consider any of the plaintiffs' federal statutory\nclaims, we held that it was free to consider those claims on remand.\nThe instant appeal and cross-appeal concern the district court's November 30, 1983 award of attorney's fees\nbased on its August 10 order. Because we vacated the entire order in Society for Good Will to Retarded Children,\nInc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984), plaintiffs have not yet prevailed on the merits in any way. An award\nof attorney's fees is available under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (Supp. IV 1980) \"only to a party who has established his\nentitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims.\" Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 757, 100 S.Ct. 1987,\n1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980) (per curiam). While our earlier opinion may make it seem likely that plaintiffs will be\nentitled to some relief, it is impossible to be certain how much 00 if any 00 will eventually be granted. Therefore, an\n97 97\naward of attorney's fees at this point would be premature. The order of class certification which we affirmed does\nnot constitute \"relief on the merits,\" and cannot be the basis of an award of attorney's fees.\nDefendants are not entitled to attorney's fees, as plaintiffs' action was not groundless. Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S.\n5, 14-15, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178-179, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) (per curiam).\nThe order of the district court, 574 F.Supp. 994, is vacated. The case is remanded with instructions to deny the\nmotion for attorney's fees, without prejudice to its subsequent renewal.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

It concerns the welfare of a few of the more than seven million mentally\nretarded individuals in this country. It also concerns the constitutional powers and constraints of federal courts\nthat are asked to grant relief when state political branches of government are perceived as too slow in improving\nindividual welfare. The district court painstakingly conducted a thorough trial and issued a decree which would\nresult in vast changes in the lives of the mentally retarded individuals involved. While the changes embodied in\nthe district court's decree may be commendable, we hold that some of those changes were requested from the\nwrong branch of government and some of them are beyond the court's constitutional power to order.\nMario Cuomo, the Governor of the State of New York, and his co-defendants appeal from a judgment of the\ndistrict court ordering changes in the living environment and training for the mentally retarded residents of the\nSuffolk Developmental Center and ordering the placement of 400 Center residents into the community by 1987.\nPlaintiffs, a class representing Center residents, cross-appeal the decision to place only 400 residents in the\n\ncommunity rather than all 1,209. We hold that part of the district court's order cannot be supported on federal\nconstitutional grounds. Because the district court did not base any relief on federal statutory grounds, we vacate\nthe order and remand for reconsideration in light of this opinion.\nI\nFacts and Procedure\nThe Suffolk Developmental Center (SDC), a state operated school for the mentally retarded on Long Island, was\nopened in 1965. At the time of trial, it housed 1,221 individuals. Of those individuals, 933 (seventy-seven percent)\nwere considered profoundly retarded (IQ below 20), 147 (twelve percent) severely retarded (IQ 20 to 35), 73 (six\npercent) moderately retarded (IQ 36 to 51), 40 (three percent) mildly retarded (IQ 52 to 69) and the remainder\neither of normal intelligence or not categorized. The population at SDC had dwindled since the mid-1970s\nbecause many of the less severely retarded individuals had left the Center; as a result, SDC in 1983 housed a\nmuch greater percentage of highly retarded individuals than it did in the 1970s.\nThe instant action was filed on August 23, 1978. The fourteen named plaintiffs-appellees are the organization of\nparents of SDC residents and thirteen mentally retarded SDC residents. Defendants-appellants are the Governor\nof New York, two state officials in the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities and the\n[1]\nDirector of SDC.  The action was brought on behalf of the named plaintiffs and all mentally retarded individuals\nresiding at SDC as well as most of those on SDC's rolls. It sought various forms of declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, including (1) improvement of conditions at SDC and of the training and education provided to SDC\nresidents, so that the residents could have \"a meaningful opportunity to improve [their] condition in the least\nrestrictive environment possible,\" and (2) transfer of SDC residents into community settings (community\nplacement) and the development of community residences and support services. The district court certified the\nplaintiff class on May 15, 1980.\nThe bench trial consumed over twenty-one court days in March, April, September and October 1982. At the trial,\n1243 more than *1243 fifty witnesses were called, 300 exhibits received and 4,000 pages of transcripts recorded. The\ncourt also visited SDC three times, once in 1978 and twice shortly after the trial. Following the trial, the court\nordered SDC's director, Fred McCormack, to submit a written four year plan for the improvement of SDC and the\nliving conditions of its residents. The plan was submitted on April 22, 1983 and public hearings were held on the\nplan in June of that year. On August 10, 1983, the district court issued its opinion and order. It predicated its order\non both the federal Constitution and New York law and declined to adjudicate any of the class' claims under\nvarious federal statutes.\nThe district court's order was a modified version of the plan submitted by McCormack. It mandated extensive\nimprovements in the facilities, care and living environment at SDC, as well as the community placement of 400\nSDC residents by 1987. Defendants appealed the class certification and the entire order. Plaintiffs cross-\nappealed the decision to place only 400 residents in the community, contending that all SDC residents should\nhave been granted community placement.\nInitially, we must review the propriety of the district court's certification of the plaintiff class. The district court has\nbroad discretion in certifying classes and we cannot say here that it has abused its discretion. Cf. Pennhurst\nState School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 5-6, 101 S.Ct.1531, 1534, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981); Woe v.\nCuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 107 (2d Cir.1984). We thus affirm the district court on its class certification.\nDuring the pendency of the trial and well before the district court's opinion and order, the United States Supreme\nCourt issued its decision in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). \nYoungberg was the first Supreme Court decision dealing with the substantive due process rights of mentally\nretarded individuals in state institutions. The district court's opinion relied heavily on its interpretation of \nYoungberg. This Court has also considered the effect of Youngberg in determining the substantive rights of SDC\nresidents and how those rights may be enforced by the federal courts, and it has relied on that decision\nextensively in its review of the district court's opinion and order.\n\nII\nThe District Court's Findings\nA. Food, Shelter, Clothing and Medical Care\nIt cannot be disputed that SDC residents have a constitutional right to adequate food, shelter, clothing and\nmedical care. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. at 316, 102 S.Ct. at 2458 (state conceded that involuntarily\ncommitted had above rights). Prison inmates have a constitutional right to decent and humane conditions, Estelle\nv. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); and residents of schools for the mentally\nretarded, who cannot be punished as can prison inmates, have rights at least as great as those of inmates. \n[2]\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. at 2458.  Appellants essentially concede that SDC residents have\nthese rights under the Due Process Clause. Br. for Appellants at 49.\nWith this in mind, we discuss whether SDC residents have been provided with constitutionally adequate food,\nshelter, clothing and medical care.\n1. Food\nAppellees stipulated that the quality and quantity of food served at SDC was adequate. J.App. at 2240-41. The\ndistrict court, however, found that SDC residents sometimes do not receive a constitutionally adequate amount of\n1244 food. It so held not because the amount of food served was inadequate, but because it found that more *1244\naggressive SDC residents grabbed the food actually served to other residents.\nAlthough there is evidence that food grabbing did occur, see J.App. at 886 (testimony of Kathy Schwaninger), we\nfind insufficient support for a holding that the food provided at SDC fails to meet constitutional minimums because\nof food grabbing. The district court has only provided two isolated examples of residents who might have been\ndenied proper food because of the behavior of other residents. Even in those two isolated instances, which\noccurred seven and sixteen years before the testimony regarding the incidents, the evidence that other residents\nmight have been to blame was highly circumstantial. We find nothing in the record to indicate that it is common\nfor residents to receive inadequate food because of the behavior of other residents.\nNevertheless, none of the district court's order is aimed at correcting the claimed constitutional deficiencies in the\nfood at SDC. Therefore, even though we hold that the district court's finding of fact was clearly erroneous, our\nholding does not affect the relief granted by the district court.\n2. Shelter\nThe district court's finding that the quality of the shelter at SDC did not meet constitutional minimums was not\nclearly erroneous. For example, in an October 1981 survey by the state Office of Health Systems Management,\nthe survey team found conditions of filth in residential areas of the building as well as flea and cockroach\ninfestations. See J.App. at 269, 274-75 (testimony of Fred McCormack). The survey team found more filth and\ninsects, as well as ample evidence of rodent infestation, during its May 1982 visit. Pl. Ex. 33; J.App. at 1256-59\n(testimony of Joseph Ryan). There was also evidence tending to show that rooms and medication cabinets were\nsometimes inordinately hot, Pl. Ex. 33, that heating sometimes did not work, J.App. at 474-77 (testimony of Fred\nMcCormack), and that various diseases such as shigella and hepatitis had been transmitted through unsanitary\nconditions, J.App. at 2418-19 (testimony of Judy Walker). In short, there was sufficient evidence for the district\ncourt to conclude that problems in the living conditions at SDC were either not being corrected or were arising on\n[3]\na recurring basis and that these problems caused the living environment to fall below constitutional standards.\n\n3. Clothing\nWe affirm the district court's finding that the provision of clothing to SDC residents violated constitutional\nstandards. There was testimony to the effect that clothing often was not clean or properly fitting. See J.App. at\n891 (testimony of Kathy Schwaninger). Appellants attempt to rebut the district court's finding partly by attempting\nto discredit a witness who the district court obviously found credible. See Br. for Appellants at 22-23, 42. We must\naccord \"great deference\" to the district court on matters such as assessing the credibility of witnesses and\nweighing conflicting testimony, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), see, e.g., Sweeney v. Research Foundation of the State\n1245 University of New York, 711 F.2d 1179, 1185 (2d Cir.1983), and we see *1245 no reason to disturb that court's\nfindings of fact. Because none of the district court's order was aimed at providing cleaner or better fitting clothing\nfor SDC residents, our holding does not affect the relief granted.\nThere was also testimony tending to show that \"adaptive\" clothing, or clothing modified to suit a client's peculiar\nphysique or to help him learn how to dress himself properly, was not being provided at SDC. See J.App. at\n891-92 (testimony of Kathy Schwaninger). The failure to provide adaptive clothing may deny SDC residents an\nopportunity to retain basic self-care skills such as dressing and toileting themselves, which would be a separate\nconstitutional violation. See infra Part II-C.\n4. Medical Care\nThe district court's finding that there was inadequate medical care at SDC was clearly erroneous. The district\ncourt erred by stating that there was a constitutional violation because there were only one or two doctors on call\nfor a 1,200 resident center, cf. Burks v. Teasdale, 492 F.Supp. 650, 677 (W.D.Mo.1980) (constitutionally adequate\nfor 2,300 inmate prison to have only one doctor on call); the unrebutted testimony was that there were physicians\nand nurses on the SDC grounds around the clock and that SDC had contracts with area hospitals for the\nprovision of medical services when residents became ill. J.App. at 2352-54 (testimony of Judy Walker). While\nthere have been occasions when patients' specific medical problems have been treated improperly, the district\ncourt's decision should not have been based on isolated instances of improper treatment, but on a finding that\nmedical care was inadequate on a class-wide basis. Isolated instances of inadequate care, or even of\nmalpractice, do not demonstrate a constitutional violation. Cf. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285,\n292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).\nIt appears, however, that no part of the district court's order is geared toward improving medical care. Therefore,\nthe error in this finding should not affect the order.\nB. Right to Safe Conditions and Freedom From Undue Bodily\nRestraint\nIn Youngberg, the Supreme Court held that involuntarily committed residents of mental institutions have a right to\nsafe conditions and to freedom from undue bodily restraint. 457 U.S. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. at 2458. Here,\nappellants contend that SDC residents do not have these rights because, with one exception, the residents are\nnot classified as \"involuntary\" and were not admitted to the Center with a court order. Br. for Appellants at 48-50.\nWe need not decide whether SDC residents are at SDC \"voluntarily\" or \"involuntarily\" because in either case they\n[4]\nare entitled to safe conditions and freedom from undue restraint.  First, prior Supreme Court holdings suggest\nthat there is a due process right to freedom from governmentally imposed undue bodily restraint for anyone at\n1246 any time. See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673-74, 97 *1246 S.Ct. 1401, 1413-14, 51 L.Ed.2d 711\n(1977); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed.1042 (1923); see also Parham v. J.R.,\n442 U.S. 584, 601, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2503, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979). Furthermore, Youngberg's reasoning and\nreliance on Supreme Court precedent also suggest that anyone in a state institution has a right to safe\nconditions. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315, 102 S.Ct., at 2458 (right to safe conditions) (citing Ingraham v.\n\nWright, 430 U.S. at 673, 97 S.Ct. at 1413 (\"Among the historic liberties [protected by the Due Process Clause]\nwas a right to be free from, and to obtain judicial relief for, unjustified intrusions on personal security.\")).\nSecond, Youngberg stated that even prison inmates who are being punished by incarceration have a right to safe\nconditions and freedom from undue restraint. Thus, the Youngberg Court reasoned, involuntarily committed\nmental patients must have those rights because they cannot constitutionally be punished. 457 U.S. at 315-16,\n102 S.Ct. at 2458. Analogously, voluntary residents of schools for the mentally retarded cannot be punished and\nare entitled to rights of personal freedom at least as great as those of prison inmates.\nAppellants place great emphasis on the fact that virtually none of SDC's residents was placed at SDC by court\norder. We find this irrelevant. Even granting that the State of New York was not required to build schools for the\nmentally retarded or admit voluntary residents, once it chose to house those voluntary residents, thus making\nthem dependent on the state, it was required to do so in a manner that would not deprive them of constitutional\nrights. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 317, 102 S.Ct. at 2459; cf., e.g., Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92\nS.Ct. 2694, 2697, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (\"[E]ven though a person has no `right' to a valuable governmental\nbenefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons ... [i]t may not deny\n[the] benefit ... on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests ....\").\nThus, SDC residents are entitled to safe conditions and freedom from undue bodily restraint whether they are\nvoluntary or involuntary residents. Our analysis cannot end there, however. The controlling standard for\ndetermining whether those rights have been violated is given in Youngberg. There, the Supreme Court held that\nwhether the state has provided the necessary safe conditions and freedom from undue restraint is determined by\nascertaining whether \"`professional judgment in fact was exercised.'\" 457 U.S. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461\n(quotation omitted). The constitutional norm is violated \"only when the decision by the professional is such a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the\nperson responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\" Id. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.\n(footnote omitted).\nWe thus analyze whether SDC residents' rights to safe conditions and freedom from undue restraint have been\nviolated, keeping in mind that the conditions to which SDC residents are subjected cannot deviate from the\n\"professional judgment\" standard.\n1. Right to Safe Conditions\nThe district court found that SDC residents' right to safe conditions was violated. It based its findings largely on\n(1) insufficient supervision to prevent SDC residents from injuring themselves or being injured by others; (2)\nsafety hazards at SDC; (3) the practice of feeding SDC residents in a supine position (which can lead to\naspiration of food); and (4) diseases transmitted to SDC residents through unsanitary conditions. There is ample\nevidence to support each of the factual findings and we agree with the district court's conclusion. Appellants'\ncontention that even more serious injuries occur when mentally retarded individuals remain at home or live in\ncommunity settings is misplaced. The question is not what setting would be most unsafe, but whether the state\n1247 must *1247 bear responsibility for unsafe conditions in its schools. We hold that it must.\n2. Right to Freedom From Undue Restraint\na. Physical Restraints\nWe agree that excess locking of doors, locking of otherwise ambulatory persons into wheelchairs and failing to\nput on leg braces for individuals who can walk with their assistance violates SDC residents' freedom from undue\nrestraint. We do not, however, agree with the district court's conclusion, 572 F.Supp. at 1346, that there is a\nliberty interest in visiting shops, restaurants and recreational facilities in the outside community. But see \nAssociation for Retarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. 473, 486 (D.N.D.1982),aff'd on other\ngrounds,713 F.2d 1384 (8th Cir.1983). The \"freedom from restraint\" with which Youngberg was concerned was\n\nNicholas Romeo's freedom from being unnecessarily shackled. We are unwilling to extend Youngberg to apply to\nsituations in which the state has done nothing to place undue physical restraints on individuals; we cannot say\nthat the state deprives an individual of a liberty interest when it fails to provide enough field trips.\nb. Community Placement\nThe district court found that \"[b]y failing to provide enough community placements ... the defendants have unduly\nrestrained many residents for whom institutional life precludes the exercise of basic liberties.\" 572 F.Supp. at\n[5]\n1347. It thus ordered that 400 SDC residents be released into community settings by the year 1987.  We hold\nthat the district court erred and that no SDC resident is deprived of freedom from undue restraint or of any other\nconstitutional right merely because he or she lives at SDC. Therefore, the order of community placement was in\nerror.\nYoungberg in no way suggests that mere residence in a school for the mentally retarded violates constitutional\nrights; there were no such allegations in the case. The Supreme Court's opinion stated that liberty from undue\nbodily restraint \"must ... survive involuntary commitment.\" 457 U.S. at 316, 102 S.Ct. at 2458. This implies that\ninvoluntary commitment by itself is not undue bodily restraint. Our conclusion is buttressed by Youngberg's\nstatement that \"decisions made by [a] professional are entitled to a presumption of correctness ... to enable\ninstitutions [such as Pennhurst] 00 often, unfortunately, overcroweded and understaffed 00 to continue to function.\" \n97 97\n457 U.S. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. This clearly implies that mere residence in an institution or school for the\nmentally retarded, without more, does not violate due process.\nThe district court's community placement order was based on the court's belief that SDC residents had a legal\nright to live in a setting that provided them with training, see infra Part II-c, while being least restrictive of their\nliberties. See, e.g., 572 F.Supp. at 1346-47 (\"[For residents who] are capable of much freer and more productive\nactivities in small group community homes ... the Constitution mandates placement in a group home, or in some\nother situation in the community, where they can effectively exercise their proven ability to live independently.\"). It\n1248 based its \"least restrictive environment\" analysis on the *1248 testimony of the experts at trial and on a state law\nright to care and treatment. We cannot affirm the community placement order on either ground.\nAfter the district court decision, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Pennhurst State School & Hospital v.\nHalderman, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). Under Pennhurst, appellees are barred by the\nEleventh Amendment from obtaining relief in federal court based on allegations that the state or its officials have\nviolated state law. See also Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d at 102. Thus, any relief granted to plaintiffs in this action\nmust be based on either federal statutes or the federal Constitution. Because the district court refrained from\nbasing its ruling on federal statutes, we may consider only whether there is an entitlement to community\nplacement or a \"least restrictive environment\" under the federal Constitution. We hold that there is no such\nentitlement.\nYoungberg held that due process is satisfied if restraints are imposed on mentally retarded individuals in\naccordance with the judgment of qualified professionals and that courts should defer to this professional\njudgment. 457 U.S. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. The district court erred in assuming that the Youngberg\nprofessional judgment standard is not met if experts at trial disagree with care or treatment decisions that were\nactually made, or think another course of conduct would have been better:\nAll experts, both defendants' and plaintiffs', agreed that many clients of the Center could be safer,\nhappier and more productive outside the institution in small community residences. Their\nprofessional judgment was that transfers should be made as soon as the facilities could be made\navailable .... The Constitution mandates community placement for those who have been adjudged\nby qualified professionals to require a community setting ....\n572 F.Supp. at 1347.\nYoungberg expressly stated that federal courts should not engage in this type of analysis. First, \"professional\njudgment\" has nothing to do with what course of action would make patients \"safer, happier and more\n\nproductive.\" Rather, it is a standard that determines whether a particular decision has substantially met\nprofessionally accepted minimum standards. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 (\"[T]he\ndecision, if made by a professional, is presumptively valid; liability may be imposed only when the decision by the\nprofessional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to\ndemonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\") (emphasis\nadded). Expert testimony is thus relevant not because of the experts' own opinions 00 which are likely to diverge\n97\nwidely 00 but because that testimony may shed light on what constitutes minimally accepted standards across the\n97\nprofession. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323 n. 31, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 n. 31 (expert testimony \"may be relevant to\nwhether [institutional] decisions were a substantial departure from the requisite professional judgment\"). While a\ncourt must ascertain what the professional standard is, it must also remember that the ultimate issue is whether\npatients' basic liberty interests are being safeguarded, not whether the optimal course of treatment as determined\nby some experts is being followed.\nSecond, Youngberg did not hold that constitutional norms are to be determined by the \"professional judgment\" of\nexperts at trial. Rather, it held that constitutional standards are met when the professional who made a decision\nexercised \"professional judgment\" at the time the decision was made. The role of the experts is only to assist the\ncourt in ascertaining what the minimum professional standard is; the ultimate question is whether \"`professional\njudgment in fact was exercised.'\" 457 U.S. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461 (quotation omitted) (emphasis added). Even\n1249 if every expert testifying at trial agrees that another type of treatment or residence setting *1249 might be better,\nthe federal courts may only decide whether the treatment or residence setting that actually was selected was a\n\"substantial departure\" from prevailing standards of practice. Id. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. See id. at 321, 102\nS.Ct. at 2461 (\"[i]t is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several professionally acceptable choices\nshould have been made\"). See also Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d at 105 (\"The question suggested by Youngberg,\nthen, is not what treatment was actually provided, but whether the treatment decision was professionally made\nand falls within the scope of professional acceptability.\") (footnote omitted).\nTherefore, we may not look to whether the trial testimony established the superiority of a \"least restrictive\nenvironment\" in general or of community placement in particular. Instead, we may rule only on whether a decision\nto keep residents at SDC is a rational decision based on professional judgment. Experts appear to disagree on\nthe appropriateness of institutionalization and we cannot say that it is professionally unacceptable. See, e.g.,\nJ.App. at 2048-50, 2082-83 (testimony of Dr. Hugh Sage). Thus, we hold that retaining residents at SDC is not\n\"such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice or standards as to demonstrate that\nthe person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment,\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323, 102\nS.Ct. at 2462, and thus that it satisfies minimum professional standards. Accord Phillips v. Thompson, 715 F.2d\n365, 368 (7th Cir.1983) (where state denied community placement to mentally retarded individuals and instead\nplaced them in state institution, decision was effectuated pursuant to professional judgment and did not violate\ndue process right to liberty of movement).\nOur conclusion that there is no constitutional right to community placement is supported by other courts. See \nPhillips v. Thompson, 715 F.2d at 368 (no denial of liberty of movement to deny community placement to several\nhundred higher functioning mentally retarded adults and to place those individuals in institutions; post-Youngberg\ndecision); Garrity v. Gallen, 522 F.Supp. 171, 237-39 (D.N.H.1981) (pre-Youngberg decision not based on\nprofessional judgment standard). More generally, post-Youngberg courts have held that there is no constitutional\nright to a \"least restrictive environment.\" See Rennie v. Klein, 720 F.2d 266, 269, 271 (3d Cir.1983) (en banc)\n(plurality and concurring opinions); Johnson v. Brelje, 701 F.2d 1201, 1210 (7th Cir.1983); Association for\nRetarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. 473, 486 (D.N.D.1982),aff'd on other grounds,713 F.2d\n1384 (8th Cir.1983). Cf. Sanchez v. New Mexico, 396 U.S. 276, 90 S.Ct. 588, 24 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970),dismissing\nfor want of a substantial federal question State v. Sanchez, 80 N.M. 438, 441, 457 P.2d 370 (1969) (appellant's\nargument that institutionalization of mentally ill persons was unconstitutional because it deprived mentally\nretarded individuals of personal liberties rejected by New Mexico Supreme Court).\n\nC. Right to Training\nThe majority opinion in Youngberg concluded that involuntarily committed mentally retarded individuals have a\ndue process right to \"such training as may be reasonable in light of [their] liberty interests in safety and freedom\nfrom unreasonable restraints.\" 457 U.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. This is \"such training as an appropriate\nprofessional would consider reasonable to ensure [their] safety and to facilitate [their] ability to function free from\nbodily restraints.\" Id. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. Thus, the Youngberg majority implied that training rights only\nexisted to safeguard other rights.\nThe Youngberg majority, however, declined to rule on whether involuntarily committed mentally retarded\nindividuals had a constitutional right to any more training than was necessary to secure freedom from undue\nrestraint and the right to safe conditions, because plaintiff Romeo had abandoned any such claims to training. \n1250 457 U.S. at 318 & n. 23, 102 S.Ct. at 2459 & *1250 n. 23. Justice Blackmun's concurrence, joined by Justices\nBrennan and O'Connor, suggested that the state may be required to provide training necessary to preserve basic\nself-care skills (such as dressing and toileting oneself) that an individual possessed when he or she entered a\nfacility for the mentally retarded. 457 U.S. at 327-29, 102 S.Ct. at 2464-65 (Blackmun, J., concurring). The\nconcurrence, however, acknowledged that the question was \"unresolved.\" Id. at 325, 102 S.Ct. at 2463. Chief\nJustice Burger, concurring alone, would have held that there was no constitutional right to any sort of training. Id.\nat 329-30, 102 S.Ct. at 2465. See also O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 580-89, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2496-2500,\n45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975) (Burger, C.J., concurring).\nWe agree with the result suggested by Justice Blackmun's concurrence, that an individual has a due process\nright to training sufficient to prevent basic self-care skills from deteriorating. As Youngberg itself reasoned,\nresidents of state schools for the mentally retarded cannot be punished and are therefore entitled to have their\nliberty interests protected at least as well as are prison inmates. Prison inmates are protected by the Eighth\nAmendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment, a provision which is designed to protect civilized\nstandards of humanity and decency. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 102, 97 S.Ct. at 290. Just as prison\nofficials cannot deprive inmates of a humane and decent existence, so SDC officials, who presumably know what\nskills each SDC resident has and whether he or she is in constant danger of losing them, cannot deprive the\nmentally retarded residents of their liberty interest in a humane and decent existence. We conclude that such\ndeprivation exists when institution officials fail to exercise professional judgment in devising programs that seek\nto allow patients to live as humanely and decently as when they entered the school, i.e., when there is no\nindividually oriented, professionally devised program to help SDC residents maintain the fundamental self-care\nskills with which they entered the Center. Cf. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 327, 102 S.Ct. at 2464 (Blackmun, J.,\nconcurring) (self-care is \"as much liberty as [many retarded individuals] ever will know\").\nFurthermore, we hold that SDC residents are entitled to such training whether they are \"voluntary\" or\n\"involuntary\" residents. The right to training exists in order to safeguard basic liberty interests. As discussed in\nPart II-B above, SDC residents are entitled to have their basic liberty interests protected irrespective of their\nclassification.\nOur holding, however, does not include a right to such training as will improve a resident's basic self-care skills\nbeyond those with which he or she entered SDC and does not encompass skills that are not basic to self-care.\nWe do not find a due process right to a specific type of treatment or training beyond that geared toward\nsafeguarding basic liberty interests. The Due Process Clause only forbids deprivations of liberty without due\nprocess of law. Where the state does not provide treatment designed to improve a mentally retarded individual's\ncondition, it deprives the individual of nothing guaranteed by the Constitution; it simply fails to grant a benefit of\noptimal treatment that it is under no constitutional obligation to grant. Because the district court declined to issue\nany rulings on federal statutory grounds, federal statutory rulings are unwarranted on appellate review. Therefore,\nwe may not find that federal statutes mandate any particular type of treatment. Moreover, even if state law\nrequires some particular type of treatment, we are precluded from determining that the treatment actually given\ndoes not live up to state standards. See Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. ___, 104\n[6]\nS.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). See also Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d at 102.\n1251\n\n*1251 The district court made the following findings of fact with regard to the type of training afforded SDC\nresidents:\nThe record contained numerous examples of precisely the sort of regression condemned in\nJustice Blackmun's concurring opinion. Loss of skills was caused by programming and other\ndeficiencies.... The record proves that while at the Center many clients have developed harmful or\ninappropriate habits (such as head-banging, feces eating, eye-gouging, and biting) .... The Center\nlacks resources to deal adequately with these and other inappropriate behaviors.\n572 F.Supp. at 1348 (emphasis added). While there may have been programs designed to deal with such\nbehavior, see Br. for Appellant at 37-40, these programs could rationally be found to have been inadequate in\nquantity or quality, or unspecific and not geared toward individual clients' needs. See, e.g., 572 F.Supp. at\n1320-21, 1348; J.App. at 786-87 (testimony of Kathy Schwaninger). Based on our holding above and the district\ncourt's findings of fact, we agree that constitutionally adequate training was not being provided to SDC residents.\nIII\nThe District Court's Order\nA. Community Placement\nWe have held that SDC residents are not unduly restrained by residing at SDC. Because of this, the portion of\nthe district court's decree ordering the community placement of 400 SDC residents by 1987 must be vacated.\nInjunctive relief should be narrowly tailored to fit the specific legal violations adjudged. See, e.g., Hartford-Empire\nCo. v. United States, 323 U.S. 386, 409-10, 65 S.Ct. 373, 385, 89 L.Ed. 322 (1945); Consolidation Coal Co. v.\nDisabled Miners of Southern West Virginia, 442 F.2d 1261, 1267 (4th Cir.) (injunction \"should be tailored to\nrestrain no more than what is reasonably required to accomplish its ends\"), cert. denied,404 U.S. 911, 92 S.Ct.\n228, 30 L.Ed.2d 184 (1971). Here, the district court should not have imposed on appellants the burden of making\ncommunity placements when the failure to do so has not been determined to violate any constitutional provisions.\nSee also Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319 n. 25, 102 S.Ct. at 2460 (\"A federal court, of course, must identify a\nconstitutional predicate for the imposition of any affirmative duty on a State.\").\nThe community placement order also cannot be justified as a remedy to correct the unconstitutional conditions\nfound at SDC. While a court order that individuals in state facilities be released may be an appropriate remedy\nwhen overcrowding is the constitutional violation, see, e.g., Benjamin v. Malcolm, 495 F.Supp. 1357\n(S.D.N.Y.1980), there has been no showing that the constitutional violations at SDC were the specific result of\nconstitutionally impermissible overcrowding. Appellants have not yet been subject to any court orders regarding\nconditions at SDC; they should first be given a chance to comply with an order geared toward remedying specific\nconstitutional violations before anything more drastic is tried.\n1252  B. Other Portions of the Order\n*1252\nBecause the district court issued its opinion before the Supreme Court's decision in Pennhurst, it did not specify\nwhich portions of its decree were based on state law and which on the federal Constitution, although it did\nexplicitly decline to rule on federal statutory grounds. Some portions of the order cannot be supported on federal\nconstitutional grounds. For example, the federal Constitution does not mandate twelve month schooling for\nmentally retarded individuals. Also, nothing in the federal Constitution would require stipends to twelve families\n\"which would cost less than the equivalent of 1.78 staff per client.\" 572 F.Supp. at 1363. And the portion of the\norder requiring a 1.78 to 1 staffing ratio appears geared toward state law considerations. See 572 F.Supp. at\n1311, J.App. at 503 (testimony of Edward Jennings) (1.78 to 1 ratio is \"adequate to obtain minimal opportunity to\nreach a six-hour programming for the clients\"); 572 F.Supp. at 1319 (New York law requires six hours of formal\nprogramming per day). Because the district court's remedy should have been narrowly tailored to remedying\n\nconstitutional violations, these portions of the order and all other portions not based on the federal Constitution\nmust be vacated.\nMost of the order may at least arguably be supported by the federal Constitution. However, because the district\ncourt could not have known about Pennhurst, which was decided over five months after its order in this case, it\ndid not specify which portions of the order were tailored to remedying federal constitutional violations and which\nwere geared toward state law violations. On remand, the district court may again order any remedy, including\nthose which were part of the original order and have not been vacated by this Court, that is intended to cure\nconstitutional deficiencies. Because a future reviewing court may not find the constitutional basis of every remedy\nself-evident, the district court should specify which protected liberty interest is implicated in each portion of a\nsubsequent order. Finally, because the district court refrained from deciding federal statutory questions, it may on\nremand consider the appropriateness of any form of relief, including community placement, under any federal\nstatutory provision specified in the complaint.\nWe vacate the district court's order and remand for further consideration in light of this opinion.\n[1] The district court deemed plaintiff's complaint amended to strike the defendants in their individual capacities.\nDocket Entry of February 17, 1982, J.App. at iv. Shortly thereafter, the court substituted for the named state\nmental health officials their successors in office: Zygmond L. Slezak (for Thomas Coughlin), Elin M. Howe (for\nJennifer Howse), and Fred A. McCormack (for Alan Sutherland). Docket Entry of March 8, 1982, J.App. at iv.\n[2] For this holding we are not required to decide whether patients reside at SDC \"voluntarily\" or \"involuntarily.\" \nSee infra Part II-B.\n[3] Both parties cite Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 106 (2d Cir.1984). In Woe, this Court held that accreditation by\nthe Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH), a national organization of psychiatric and medical\nprofessionals, constitutes prima facie proof of the adequacy of care and treatment. Woe, however, only dealt with\nJCAH accreditation; the adequacy of JCAH procedures and standards was litigated in the lower court in that\ncase. See Woe v. Cuomo, 559 F.Supp. 1158, 1162-65 (E.D.N.Y.1983),aff'd,729 F.2d 96 (2d Cir.1984). There has\nbeen virtually no litigation over the adequacy of state inspection procedures in this case. Even if Woe were\napplicable here, however, that case only held that JCAH accreditation was prima facie proof of adequate care.\nBecause the district court held here that adequate shelter was not being provided, it obviously accepted the\ntestimony of plaintiffs' experts who rebutted the prima facie case. As a reviewing court, we cannot weigh the\ntestimony differently and we do not conclude from the record that the district court's eventual findings of fact were\nclearly erroneous.\n[4] The district court called the residents of SDC \"technically voluntary.\" 572 F.Supp. at 1342. It is likely, however,\nthat if over 75 percent of SDC residents are \"profoundly or severely retarded,\" id. at 1304, they are best\ncategorized as \"non-objecting residents\" because they are unlikely to have sufficient understanding to recognize\nthat they are being admitted to a school for the mentally retarded and to understand the distinction between\nvoluntary and involuntary status or the provisions governing release. See N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law §§ 15.15, 15.25\n(McKinney 1978). While we do not decide whether SDC residents are voluntary or involuntary, we do note that\nnon-objecting residents have the right to be released on request (unless there is reason to convert them to\ninvoluntary status), while involuntary residents may be retained against their will by court order. See N.Y. Mental\nHyg. Law §§ 15.25(c), 15.33(a) (McKinney 1978). Also, the procedures for admitting and discharging \"non-\nobjecting\" residents resemble similar procedures for \"voluntarily\" admitted minor mental patients that the\nSupreme Court found constitutional in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 588 & n. 3, 606-17, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2497 &\nn. 3, 2506-2511, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979). See also N.Y.Admin.Code tit. 14, § 15.4(b)(1) (1980) (voluntarily\nadmitted minors who were admitted by application of parent or guardian may be converted to non-objecting\nstatus when they reach 18).\n[5] The order is virtually inconsistent with the district court's findings of fact. At the time of trial, there were 1,221\nSDC residents, only 271 of whom were not classified as \"profoundly retarded (IQ below 20).\" 572 F.Supp. at\n1304. We thus question how there could be 400 SDC residents \"for whom institutional life precludes the exercise\nof basic liberties.\" Id. at 1347. The district court's example of one such resident appears to be an exceptional\n\ncircumstance, as it appears that this resident may not belong in an institution at all. Compare id. at 1346-47\n(\"Some residents, such as Laura Knapp, are unduly physically restrained by living in the Center.\") with, e.g.,\nJ.App. at 2397 (testimony of Judy Walker) (\"[I]t is an awful shame that [Ms. Knapp] has been in an institution all\nthese years.\"). Moreover, the district court did not identify which 400 residents (or what subclass of residents) it\nconsidered unduly restrained by mere residence at SDC.\n[6] We are mindful that \"due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable\nrelation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\" Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738, 92 S.Ct.\n1845, 1858, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972). But even though SDC residents are to be provided with \"care and treatment,\"\nN.Y. Mental Hyg. Law § 33.03(a) (McKinney 1978), this does not mean that SDC residents have a constitutional\nright to treatment that will cure or even improve their condition. The Supreme Court appears to have accepted\nthat the training given to a mentally retarded individual is his or her \"treatment.\" See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 309\nn. 1, 311 n. 5, 313 n. 12, 319, 102 S.Ct. at 2454 n. 1, 2455 n. 5, 2456 n. 12, 2460. We agree, and hold that the\nonly constitutional right of \"treatment\" to which SDC residents are entitled is that which we have held is the\nconstitutionally mandated minimum level of training. When we also consider that patients are placed at SDC by\ntheir relatives as a last resort because the relatives cannot take care of them, see 572 F.Supp. at 1343, we\ncannot find that there is any due process expectation of treatment designed to cure or improve mental\nretardation. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320-21 n. 27, 102 S.Ct. at 2460 n. 27 (this factor distinguishes cases\nsuch as the one at bar from Jackson, a procedural due process case). See also Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 330 n. *, \n102 S.Ct. at 2466 n. * (Burger, C.J., concurring).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

(collectively \"appellants\" or \"LIDC officials\") and appellees/cross-\nappellants Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc., et al. (\"the Society\") appeal from an order and\njudgment entered August 3, 1989, 718 F.Supp. 139, in the Eastern District of New York, Jack B. Weinstein, \nDistrict Judge, finding constitutional violations in conditions and treatment at the Long Island Developmental\nCenter (\"LIDC\") and ordering population reduction and community placement as remedial measures.\nBoth sides find fault with various aspects of the district court's judgment. On appeal, appellants contend that the\ncourt (1) clearly erred in finding that housing, food, medical treatment and habilitation at LIDC were\nconstitutionally inadequate; and (2) exceeded its authority in ordering population reduction and community\nplacement as remedial measures to correct constitutional deficiencies. On cross-appeal, the Society contends\nthat the court erred in (1) refusing to address its federal statutory claims; (2) ordering placement of patients in\nsmall residential units (known as \"SRUs\"); (3) increasing the average bed size of community residences; and (4)\nrefusing to appoint a special master to oversee LIDC. The Society also appeals from the court's denial of its Rule\n60(b) motion to resettle the court's order entered August 3, 1989 with respect to the bed size of community\nresidences.\nFor the reasons which follow, we reverse the order and judgment of the district court and we remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI.\nWe summarize only those facts and prior proceedings believed necessary to an understanding of the issues\nraised on appeal. This eleven-year old class action comes before us for the third time. We assume familiarity with\nprior opinions of this Court and the district court. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 572\nF.Supp. 1300 (E.D.N.Y.1983),vacated and remanded,737 F.2d 1239 (2 Cir.1984) (\"Good Will I\"); 103 F.R.D. 168\n(E.D.N.Y.1984); 652 F.Supp. 515 (E.D.N.Y.1987), rev'd., 832 F.2d 245 (2d Cir.1987) (\"Good Will II\").\nThe Long Island (formerly Suffolk) Developmental Center is a state-operated school for the mentally retarded. On\nAugust 23, 1978, the Society (the parents' organization at LIDC) and thirteen mentally retarded LIDC residents\n\ncommenced a class action on behalf of themselves and all other mentally retarded LIDC residents. Appellants,\nsued in their official capacities, are the Governor of New York, two state officials in the Office of Mental\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities, and the Director of LIDC. This action challenged conditions at LIDC\nand sought various forms of declaratory and injunctive relief. On May 15, 1980, the district court certified the\nplaintiff class.\n1087 *1087 Following a bench trial in 1983, the district court found that conditions and treatment at LIDC fell below\nconstitutionally-required minimums. It ordered LIDC officials to develop a detailed plan to improve the facility.\nAppellants complied and submitted a written four-year plan for improvement of LIDC and the living conditions of\nits residents.\nBy order of August 10, 1983, the district court issued a decree which embodied a modified version of the plan\nsubmitted by appellants (known as the \"McCormack Plan\"). Society for Good Will, supra, 572 F.Supp. at 1352-64.\nThe decree was based on federal constitutional and state law grounds. In view of its holding, the court declined to\nadjudicate any of the class' claims under various federal statutes. Id. at 1349.\nOn appeal and cross-appeal, we vacated the district court's order of August 10, 1983. Good Will I, supra,737\nF.2d at 1239. We held that that part of the order which required community placement could not be justified on\nfederal constitutional grounds. Id. at 1247-49. We further held that there is no entitlement to community\nplacement or a \"least restrictive environment\" under the federal Constitution. Id. at 1248-49. Specifically, we held\nthat the district court misapplied the Youngberg \"professional judgment\" standard, Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S.\n307 (1982), in holding that \"[t]he Constitution mandates community placement for those who have been adjudged\nby qualified professionals to require a community setting.\" Good Will I, supra,737 F.2d at 1248 (quoting Society\nfor Good Will, supra, 572 F.Supp. at 1347). Since LIDC's decision to retain residents was not a \"substantial\ndeparture\" from prevailing standards of practice, see Youngberg, supra, 457 U.S. at 323, we concluded that that\ndecision satisfied minimum professional standards. Good Will I, supra,737 F.2d at 1249.\nMoreover, we held that \"the community placement order also cannot be justified as a remedy to correct the\nunconstitutional conditions found at [LIDC].\" Id. at 1251. We observed, however, that, apart from the community\nplacement part of the order, most of the court's order arguably could be supported under the federal Constitution.\nSince the Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from granting state law relief in actions against state officials, \nPennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), decided after the district court's decision in\nGood Will I, we remanded the case for reconsideration so that the district court could determine which parts of its\norder were supported by federal law. We further instructed the district court that on remand it might consider the\nSociety's federal statutory claims.\nOn remand, appellants volunteered to implement the McCormack Plan, as modified by the district court's order of\nAugust 10, 1983. In light of this action, Judge Weinstein dismissed all remaining claims as moot. Society for\nGood Will, supra, 103 F.R.D. at 169. In 1986, the Society moved to reinstate its action, contending that LIDC\nofficials had not implemented the McCormack Plan. Judge Weinstein denied the motion, but allowed the Society\nto file its motion as a new complaint. Society for Good Will, supra, 652 F.Supp. at 527. The Society instead\nappealed to our Court from the order denying its motion to reinstate the action. We reversed and remanded,\ndirecting (1) that the original action be reinstated; (2) that the court consider whether the state had waived\nsovereign immunity; and (3) that further proceedings be conducted to allow the Society to obtain any relief to\nwhich the plaintiff class may be entitled. Good Will II, supra, 832 F.2d at 246.\nFollowing this latest remand, the district court held seven days of hearings in May and June, 1988. At these\nhearings, LIDC officials testified to planned renovations at LIDC, including the restoration of small cottages and\nconstruction of small residential units, which would accommodate a total of 488 residents. Judge Weinstein\nrevisited LIDC. He toured the site of the new SRUs being developed on the grounds of LIDC. LIDC officials and\ntheir expert witnesses testified to improvements at LIDC in housing, food, sanitary conditions, and resident care.\n1088 The Society and its experts, *1088 on the other hand, introduced federal and state surveys showing that\nconditions and treatment at LIDC were less than acceptable and did not comply with applicable federal\nstandards.\n\nBy its order and judgment entered August 3, 1989, 718 F.Supp. 139, the district court held that the constitutional\nrights of LIDC residents under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment were\nbeing violated. Although it noted that there had been \"[e]normous improvements in conditions at the Center\", the\ncourt found a constitutionally intolerable \"loss of capacity\" in LIDC residents as a result of inadequate facilities,\ntreatment, and habilitation. Id. at 140. In view of these findings, the court held that it was not necessary to reach\nany of the Society's federal statutory claims. It declined to find any waiver by the state of its sovereign immunity. It\nalso held that appointment of a special master to supervise the institution was not necessary, since LIDC officials\n\"are fully committed to improvement\" and had been \"relatively forthcoming in [the state's] budgetary allocations.\" \nId. at 141. As a remedial measure, the court ordered reduction of the client population by transferring patients to\nsmall residential settings in the community. Subsequently, the court denied the Society's Rule 60(b) motion to\nresettle the order with respect to the size of community facilities.\nThis appeal and cross-appeal followed.\nII.\n(A)\nWe turn first to appellants' contention that the district court's findings of constitutional deficiencies in conditions\nand treatment at LIDC were clearly erroneous. LIDC officials assert that those findings are not supported by the\nweight of the evidence. They urge us to reverse. We agree that the case must be reversed, but for a different\nreason.\nThe district court found violations of constitutional magnitude in six respects at LIDC: safe conditions, bodily\nrestraints, training (or \"habilitation\"), housing, food, and medical treatment. In its order and judgment of August 3,\n1989, the court referred to \"oral findings made on the record.\" 718 F.Supp. at 141. A review of the record, and in\nparticular the oral findings at the hearing of June 8, 1989, however, discloses only conclusions of law 00 not\n97\nspecific findings of fact. At that hearing, Judge Weinstein stated:\n\"Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of constitutional violation and a violation of federal\nstatutes.... [T]he standards laid down by the Court of Appeals, I think, at least from a prima facie\npoint of view, have been shown to be violated. The testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses shows\nregression which is the key to the constitutional violation and the very extensive state and federal\nlistings of lack of compliance with standards shows a prima facie violation of the statutes.\"\nWe hold that these conclusory findings, read along with the district court's order and judgment of August 3, 1989,\nfail to satisfy the fact finding requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).\nRule 52(a) requires that a trial court \"find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\" \nSee Inverness Corp. v. Whitehall Laboratories, 819 F.2d 48, 50 (2 Cir.1987) (per curiam) (\"Rule 52(a)'s\nrequirement that the trial court find facts specially and state its conclusions of law is mandatory and cannot be\nwaived.\"). The requirement that the district court find facts \"specially\" serves two purposes: \"to aid the trial court\nby requiring it to marshal the evidence before it and, more importantly, to aid us in our review.\" Republic of\nPhilippines v. New York Land Co., 852 F.2d 33, 37 (2 Cir.1988) (emphasis added). On the record before us, we\nsimply cannot appropriately review the district court's findings of constitutional deficiencies to determine whether\nthey are clearly erroneous.\nMoreover, Judge Weinstein's oral statements at the June 8 hearing cannot justify the sweeping relief granted. On\n1089 the prior appeal, we agreed with Justice *1089 Blackmun's concurrence in Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 327-29\n(Blackmun, J. concurring), that an individual has a due process right to training sufficient to prevent basic self-\ncare skills from deteriorating. Good Will I, 737 F.2d at 1250. There, we upheld findings of \"`numerous examples of\nprecisely the same sort of regression condemned in Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion [in Youngberg],'\" 737\nF.2d at 1251 (emphasis added) (quoting 572 F.Supp. at 1348). We concluded that \"constitutionally adequate\ntraining was not being provided to [LIDC] residents.\" Id. In the record on the instant appeal, no particular\n\ninstances of regression (i.e., that a resident's basic self-care skills had deteriorated since entering the institution)\nwere shown. We cannot uphold the district court's remedial order and judgment on that basis.\nWe are aware that in Good Will I, we upheld certain of the findings of constitutional violations here involved. 737\nF.2d at 1244 (housing); 1246-47 (safe conditions); 1247 (bodily restraints); 1249-51 (training). But we cannot\nuphold the district court's findings here 00 made in 1989 00 based on our decision on the prior appeal. The court's\n97 97\noriginal findings of deficiencies were made in 1983. We upheld those findings in 1984. Furthermore, at the June 8\nhearing, and in its August 3 order and judgment, the district court acknowledged that since 1978 or 1979 there\nhave been \"[e]normous improvements in conditions at the Center.\" 718 F.Supp. at 140. The passage of time,\ncombined with the court's observation that there have been improvements at LIDC, makes it improper for us to\nrely on our decision in Good Will I as a basis for upholding findings of deficiencies made in 1989. We are not\nadvised as to which, if any, of the 1984 findings remain valid.\nWe hold that the district court failed to find facts \"specially\" as required by Rule 52(a). The court's order and\njudgment, together with its oral findings, do not support the sweeping grant of relief. Its summary and conclusory\nfindings are simply inadequate to allow for satisfactory review by us. We therefore remand the case with\ninstructions that the district court find facts \"specially\" in accordance with Rule 52(a).\n(B)\nEven if we were to disregard the district court's failure to comply with Rule 52(a) 00 which we do not 00 the court\n97 97\nmisapplied the Youngberg professional judgment standard in determining that the constitutional rights of LIDC\nresidents were being violated.\nIn Youngberg, the Supreme Court held that \"liability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional\nis such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate\nthat the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such judgment.\" 457 U.S. at 323 And we\nexplained in Good Will I, 737 F.2d at 1248, that the issue is not whether the optimal course of treatment as\ndetermined by some experts was being followed, but whether \"`professional judgment in fact was exercised.'\" \nYoungberg, supra, 457 U.S. at 321, (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In this respect, the district court in the\ninstant case failed to heed the requirements of Youngberg and our decision in Good Will I.\nRelying on expert testimony, the district court concluded that there was \"loss of capacity in residents\" due to\nLIDC's failure to \"provide reasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints\nand minimally adequate training.\" 718 F.Supp. at 140. The court held that these failures amounted to\nconstitutional violations. In so holding, the court failed to determine whether the conditions and treatment at LIDC\nsubstantially departed from accepted professional judgment, as required by Youngberg. The court instead\nmisused expert testimony by treating it as evidence of alternative choices against which the institution's treatment\nshould be compared.\nWe stated in Good Will I that \"the role of the experts is only to assist the court in ascertaining what the minimum\n1090 professional standard is....\" 737 F.2d at 1248. Expert reports and testimony should be used *1090 only to\nestablish the general parameters of acceptable, constitutional activity, and not whether the exercised professional\njudgment was indisputably correct and unassailable 00 or for that matter even a better approach to the problem.\n97\nThe district court's role in this respect was not to evaluate different choices and determine which of these choices\nwere better; rather, the court was required to evaluate the challenged treatment to determine whether such\ntreatment had substantially met professionally accepted minimum standards. The court failed to comply with such\nrequirement.\nWe hold that the district court erred in finding constitutional violations, without first determining whether the\nconditions and treatment at LIDC substantially departed from accepted professional judgment. On remand, we\ninstruct the district court, in determining the existence of constitutional violations, to identify specifically any ways\nin which the institution's treatment was \"a substantial departure from the requisite professional judgment,\" \nYoungberg, supra, 457 U.S. at 323 n. 31, and therefore unconstitutional. In its inquiry, the district court should\n\nuse expert testimony to identify \"substantial departures\", but not to choose from among several professionally\nacceptable remedies.\nIII.\nThis brings us to appellants' contention that the district court exceeded its authority in ordering population\nreduction and community placement as remedial measures to correct the constitutional violations found by the\ncourt. Appellants assert that the court's decree was not narrowly tailored to remedy constitutional violations and\nthat the court erred in granting injunctive relief without first identifying the specific constitutional violations that\neach part of the ordered remedy would cure. We agree.\nAfter finding constitutionally inadequate conditions and treatment at LIDC, the court ordered LIDC officials to take\na number of remedial steps, including the \"necessary remedial measure\" of community placement. 718 F.Supp.\nat 141. The court ordered reduction of the resident population at LIDC through transfers to community programs\n\"to the extent reasonable\" (moving some 400 individuals over four years), and by placing patients in community\nresidences averaging 12 beds in size. Id.\nIn framing its decree, the district court disregarded our decision in Good Will I, supra,737 F.2d at 1239. On the\nprior appeal, we held that \"there is no constitutional right to community placement,\" id. at 1249, and that\ncommunity placement \"could not be justified as a remedy to correct the unconstitutional conditions found at\n[LIDC].\" Id. at 1251.\nWe cautioned that \"[i]njunctive relief should be narrowly tailored to fit the specific legal violations adjudged.\" Id.\nMoreover, we held that the district court \"should not have imposed on appellants the burden of making\ncommunity placements when the failure to do so has not been determined to violate any constitutional\nprovisions.\" Id. We further instructed the district court that LIDC officials \"should first be given a chance to comply\nwith an order geared toward remedying specific constitutional violations before anything more drastic [i.e.,\ncommunity placement] is tried.\" Id. In issuing its decree, the district court failed to comply with our instructions.\nThe court summarily attempted to justify its remedy by reasoning that \"[t]he administrative limitations on the\ninstitution make it apparent that the constitutional rights of clients cannot be protected without further reduction of\nthe client population.\" 718 F.Supp. at 141. The \"administrative limitations\" were not identified. Presumably they\nare lack of resources 00 people and funds 00 rather than any technical administrative regulation. If that is the case,\n97 97\nthen the district court should frame a decree that obliges appellants to devote sufficient resources to cure the\nparticular constitutional violations, giving appellants the choice, if they wish, to move residents into community\nplacement rather than increase resources at the institution.\n1091 *1091 On remand, we instruct the district court, if it finds particular constitutional violations, to tailor any relief it\norders narrowly to cure the violations, not simply to optimize conditions at LIDC. In particular, the district court\n\"should specify which protected liberty interest is implicated in each portion of a subsequent order.\" Good Will I,\nsupra,737 F.2d at 1252. We further instruct the district court that community placement may be ordered only as a\nremedy of last resort and only when intra-institutional remedies are inadequate to cure the \"substantial\ndepartures\" required by Youngberg.\nIV.\nAfter finding that conditions and treatment at LIDC violated the residents' constitutional rights, Judge Weinstein\nconcluded that \"it is not necessary to determine whether specific federal statutes are being violated.\" 718 F.Supp.\nat 141. On the cross-appeal, the Society asserts that the district court erred in failing to consider whether there\nhave been statutory violations. The Society asserts that the Medicaid statute and regulations, 42 U.S.C. § 1396\n(1988), and 42 C.F.R. § 483.400 et seq. (1988), and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988), offer\nalternative bases for upholding the relief awarded by the district court and for granting significant additional relief\nas well.\n\nIn Good Will I, we vacated the order and remanded the case so that the court could determine which parts of the\norder were supported by federal law. 737 F.2d at 1252. We stated that \"because the district court refrained from\ndeciding federal statutory questions, it may on remand consider the appropriateness of any form of relief,\nincluding community placement, under any federal statutory provision specified in the complaint.\" Id.\nNormally it would be preferable for a court to consider statutory claims first before proceeding to constitutional\nclaims. But this case may well be the unusual one where that traditional sequence is inappropriate. The\nconstitutional standards in this area are reasonably clear, yet the theories of statutory violations advanced by the\nSociety would require adjudication of novel and complex issues. Under these circumstances, we will require the\ndistrict court to adjudicate the statutory issues only in the event that it concludes that plaintiffs would be entitled to\nsome forms of relief as a remedy for statutory violations beyond whatever relief the court may order for\nconstitutional violations. We of course express no opinion at this time on the merits of such statutory claims.\nV.\nIn view of our disposition of this case, the question whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\nappoint a special master is moot. Moreover, since we are remanding the case, we find it neither necessary nor\nappropriate to address the merits of the Society's other contentions on its cross-appeal, including the denial of its\nRule 60(b) motion.\nVI.\nTo summarize:\nWe hold that the district court erred in failing to find facts \"specially\" as required by Rule 52(a), in failing to\ndetermine whether conditions and treatment at LIDC substantially departed from accepted professional judgment,\nand in ordering community placement to remedy the constitutional violations found by the court.\nOn remand, we instruct the district court to find facts \"specially\", and to identify specifically any ways in which\nconditions and treatment at LIDC were \"substantial departure[s] from accepted professional judgment.\" If the\ncourt finds constitutional violations, the relief it orders should be narrowly tailored to cure those violations and not\naimed at optimizing conditions at LIDC. The court should identify the specific constitutional violation at which\neach remedial measure is directed. We instruct the district court to consider and make specific findings on the\nSociety's statutory claims in the event that it determines that the plaintiffs would be entitled to some form of relief\n1092 as a remedy for statutory *1092 violations beyond whatever relief the court may order for constitutional violations.\nWe reverse the order and judgment of the district court and we remand the case to the district court for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\nReversed and remanded.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

CUOMO, as Governor of the State of New York, et al., Defendants.\nNo. 78-Civ.-1847.\nUnited States District Court, E.D. New York.\nAugust 10, 1983.\n11330012 *1301*1302 Murray B. Schneps, Michael S. Lottman, New York City, for plaintiffs.\nRobert Abrams, Atty. Gen. of the State of N.Y., New York City by Caren S. Brutten, William J. Caplow, Frederick\nK. Mehlman, Asst. Attys. Gen., New York City, Alan M. Adler, Deputy Counsel, State of N.Y., Albany, N.Y., for\ndefendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nWEINSTEIN, Chief Judge:\nThis litigation plumbs the despair and guilt of society and of the parents of profoundly retarded children. Mothers\nand fathers, after courageous struggles to care for their offspring at home, overwhelmed by lack of respite and\nassistance, felt compelled to turn over responsibility for them to the state. They acted reluctantly in order to save\na modicum of sane living for their families and because they believed the state could do more for their deprived\nyoungsters than they could.\nSome twelve hundred clients are housed at the Suffolk Developmental Center. Their dismal lives are relieved by\nthe love and devotion of many of the parents and members of the Center's staff. New York (aided by the federal\ngovernment), while doing less than the Constitution and laws require, has made many millions of taxpayers'\ndollars available.\nThe substantial efforts on behalf of these disabled people remind us that ours is fundamentally a compassionate\nand caring community. Once such people would have been exposed on a mountainside to die or would have\nbeen hidden in shame. Now they are kept alive and in view. But the law, expressing the concern of the state and\nnation for each person, requires that more than existence be preserved. It insists that some degree of humanity\n1303 and dignity be safeguarded. As indicated below, the state *1303 has done less than the Constitution mandates.\nAccordingly, the courts are compelled to order that it do more.\nI. PROCEDURE\nA class action was commenced on August 23, 1978 by the Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc., the\nparents' organization at Suffolk Developmental Center (the Center), and 13 mentally retarded individuals on\nbehalf of themselves and more than 1,500 other persons then in residence at, or on the rolls of, the Center.\nPlaintiffs seek, on various constitutional and statutory grounds, 1) the improvement of conditions at the Center, 2)\nthe expansion of community resources and support services in Nassau and Suffolk counties for the mentally\nretarded and for their families and 3) transfer of most of the clients at the Center to small community residences.\nDefendants, sued in their official capacity, are the Governor of the State of New York and the personnel of the\nNew York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. Jurisdiction is not disputed. 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343.\n\nThe Center was opened in 1965. It is a state-run residential institution for the mentally retarded on 465 acres in\nMelville, Long Island, New York. 1,209 individuals now reside there. Most of the buildings house severely\nhandicapped individuals in wards that generally contain between 20 to 25 beds. Many of the clients are non-\nambulatory and physically disabled. There are also eight or nine \"cottages\" with somewhat smaller wards for less\nseverely retarded clients capable of walking and taking care of some of their own functions. The Center has a\n\"medical-surgical\" building (number 16) with one \"acute\" and three \"chronic\" wards, as well as two wards housing\nnon-ambulatory clients and a pulmonary unit for 25 clients with upper respiratory problems (building 19). Four\nbuildings (4, 9, 20 and 21) are used exclusively for program activities.\nAdministrative responsibility for the Center rests with defendant Fred McCormack who, as Director of the Long\nIsland Developmental Disabilities Services Office, is also in charge of the state's community placement in Nassau\nand Suffolk counties. Mr. McCormack reports to defendant Elin Howe, Associate Commissioner of the New York\nState Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities for the Southeastern County Service Group,\nanswerable (through Deputy Commissioner Samuel Kawola) to defendant Commissioner Zygmond Slezak, who\nreports ultimately to the defendant Governor. [Extensive references to pages in the record and exhibits as well as\nappendices are in the typescript copy on file in the clerk's office.]\nCertified as a class action on May 15, 1980, the case was tried without a jury. Court proceedings included over\n21 trial days during March, April, September and October, 1982 in addition to numerous conferences and\nmotions. The Court has heard more than 50 witnesses and received over 300 exhibits. Some 4,000 pages of\ntranscripts were recorded.\nOn February 24, 1983, following the last of its three visits to the Center, the first in November 1978, and the\nsecond and third in February of this year, the Court issued an interim memorandum finding that conditions and\ntreatment at the Center failed to meet the minimum standards required by the Constitution. It ordered the Director\nto prepare a written four year plan that would meet constitutional standards. That plan was submitted to the Court\non April 24, 1983.\nPublic hearings on the plan were held by the Court in June 1983 at the District's Brooklyn and Uniondale\ncourthouses. Parents and spokespersons for private and governmental agencies as well as unions representing\nworkers at the Center appeared. During those hearings the Court issued oral orders to amend the Director's plan.\nAs modified, that plan is now embodied in this Court's decree.\nII. MENTAL RETARDATION\nA. Definition\n1304 Mental retardation, the basis for residence at the Center, is defined as 1) significantly *1304 sub-average\nintellectual functioning (i.e., two standard deviations below the mean on an intelligence test), 2) combined with\nsignificant deficiencies in adaptive behavior (i.e., appropriate exercise of personal independence and social\nresponsibility), and 3) manifested in the individual's developmental period.\nOf 1,204 Center residents assessed as of March 1982, 11 were considered to be of normal intelligence, 40 to be\nmildly mentally retarded (IQ 52 to 69), 73 to be moderately retarded (IQ 36 to 51), 147 to be severely retarded (IQ\n20 to 35), and 933 to be profoundly retarded (IQ below 20); the functioning level for 17 clients was unknown.\nReduction in population has resulted in leaving the most difficult cases at the Center. Whereas the client\npopulation of the Center in 1974 (total 1,774) was 4% borderline or normal, 7% mildly retarded, 13% moderately\nretarded, 22% severely retarded, and 52% profoundly retarded, the comparable percentages at present are 1%\nnormal, 3% mildly retarded, 6% moderately retarded, 18% severely retarded and 68% profoundly retarded.\nApproximately 55% of the current population is male; 1% is under age 12; 14% are between ages 13 and 20;\n58% between ages 21 and 34; 24% between ages 35 and 64; and 2% are over age 65. Those who are of\n\"normal\" intelligence appear to have been sent to the Center as a result of historical mistakes in classification as\nin the case of a deaf mute who was thought to be retarded. Many of the clients were kept at home by their\nparents until, in their early adolescence, they became hyperactive and overwhelmed their families.\n\nB. History\nIn post-medieval times the retarded, together with imbeciles, idiots, madmen, the feeble-minded and the insane,\nfrom whom they were not generally distinguished, were viewed as the progeny of the supernatural, and in the last\nseveral centuries as agents of the devil. See L. Kanner, A History of the Care and Study of the Mentally Retarded\n5-7 (1964); W. Wolfensberger, The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models, in Changing Patterns in\nResidential Services for the Mentally Retarded (President's Committee on Mental Retardation, 1976) 36.\nVestiges of that attitude may be found today. Recently, a 14 year old retarded boy was discovered who had been\nkept a virtual prisoner in his home from birth. The boy's father apparently feared that his son's condition would\nshame or embarrass the rest of his family. N.Y. Times, October 9, 1982, at 8, col. 6.\nImpetus for the institutionalization of the mentally retarded may be traced to the reform impulse in Western social\nthought accompanying political upheavals at the end of the eighteenth century. The revolutionary legacy resulted\nin new perceptions of both the potential for human improvement and of the role of the state in providing the\nnecessary services. Compare B.W. Tuchman, A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century 108\n(Ballantine ed. 1979) (\"cure being left to God\").\nIn nineteenth century America the movement to institutionalize the mentally retarded arose in response to several\ninteracting factors. The theoretical groundwork had been laid in France in the mid-eighteenth century when Jacob\nRodrigues Pereire had shown that deaf mutes, thought completely uneducable until then, could be taught to read\nand communicate through sign language. See L. Kanner, supra, at 11. This led to the view that others, such as\nidiots who had likewise been thought to be incapable of responding to education, could benefit from it. Jean Marc\nGaspard Itard's subsequent work with Victor, the \"wild boy of Aveyon,\" further intensified professional interest in\nthe education of idiots. Victor, an apparently severely retarded child was found in the forest, where he had\nroamed \"wild\" for some years, probably after his family had abandoned him. Gaspard taught him to walk upright,\nspeak, feed and dress himself. See L. Kanner, supra, at 12-16; Mason and Menolascino, The Right to Treatment\nfor Mentally Retarded Citizens: An Evolving Legal and Scientific Interface, 10 Creighton L.Rev. 124, 127-28\n(1976).\n1305 *1305 The first school for the feeble-minded was established in Abendburg, Switzerland in the 1840's by Johann\nJakob Guggenbuhl. See L. Kanner, supra, at 17-26. It was visited by Samuel Gridley Howe who shortly thereafter\nbegan the first publicly supported school for retarded children in Massachusetts in 1848. L. Kanner, supra, at 25,\n41. Itard trained the French-born Edouard Onesimus Seguin, who spent 18 months in 1837-38 educating an idiot\nboy so that he could \"make better use of his senses, could remember and compare, speak, write and count.\" L.\nKanner, supra, at 35. Seguin later came to the United States as a general consultant on the education of idiots. L.\nKanner, supra, at 37.\nThe emphasis accorded education as a means of treatment for the mentally retarded was predicated on an\nassumption that mental retardation was a disease, like other similarly perceived problems of the mind, such as\ninsanity, and of the spirit, such as criminality. The social reformers' vision of institutionalization of the mentally\nretarded melded this faith in the curative potential of education, and concomitant assumption that retardation was\ncurable, together with the view that such diseases derived from defects in the environment.\nItard's and Guggenbuhl's work was thought to have demonstrated that the environment could be both the cause\nof and cure for mental defects. See D. Rothman, The Discovery of the Asylum 131 (1971). Thus, by altering or\nmodifying the environment to purge noxious elements, the mentally retarded person, it was supposed, could be\nmade well. See D. Rothman, supra, at 111. The notion underlying temporary confinement was removal of those\nunable to cope with the strains and uncertainties of life in the community. Rehabilitation would occur by providing\nsuch individuals with an environment of calm and regular routine. D. Rothman, supra, at 133. The first\ninstitutions, like many of the later ones, were built away from urban centers and with an architectural emphasis on\norder and regularity. D. Rothman, supra, at 137-138, 142, 152-153.\nThe founders' fundamental belief in their institutions as forums of cure was rooted in a vision of their function as\none of education, not of custody. During the second half of the nineteenth century, however, it became apparent\n\nthat the idiocy and feeble-mindedness for which institutional treatment had been prescribed was neither being\ncured nor made better by the institutions. D. Rothman, supra, at 282. The rationale of rehabilitation gave way to\none of custody. D. Rothman, supra, at 265; W. Wolfensberger, supra, at 52. Since institutional residence became\npermanent rather than temporary, the number of residents grew dramatically. State legislatures' appropriations,\nhowever, did not keep pace with the increase in institutional populations resulting in the overcrowding,\nunderstaffing, and lack of workshop and programming materials that continue to characterize many large\ninstitutions, including the Center. See D. Rothman, supra, at 269-270; W. Wolfensberger, supra, at 53-54.\nA parallel pattern of optimism replaced by pessimism characterized the hope for cure that led to the\ninstitutionalization of criminals. That vision, however, has left a legacy of overcrowded and often brutal prisons\nwhere hope for rehabilitation is almost abandoned. D. Rothman, supra, at 79.\nIn the twentieth century the environmental theory of the origin of mental defects was replaced by a social\nDarwinism that recycled the trappings of the reform ideology. D. Rothman, supra, at 260-295. Thus, confinement\nand physical isolation from the community were perpetuated under a new rationale that sought to protect society\nfrom the retarded, and the retarded from society, rather than to educate them for entry into it. See D. Rothman, \nsupra, at 285-286; W. Wolfensberger, supra, at 51-53; L. Kanner, supra, at 85-86.\nFear of the mentally retarded was embodied in the eugenics scare that followed Goddard's publication of the\nKallikak monograph in 1912. It traced social immorality and criminality to genetically inherited feeble-mindedness.\n1306 See L. Kanner, supra, at 130-132; W. Wolfensberger, supra, at 54-58. *1306 Politically, that fear was manifested\nin the enactment of various state statutes preventing marriage with the feeble-minded and insane, see W.\nWolfensberger, supra, at 59, and providing for compulsory sterilization to prevent the procreation of more\n\"confined criminals, idiots, imbeciles, and rapists.\" L. Kanner, supra, at 136; W. Wolfensberger, supra at 59. See\ngenerally Cynkar, Buck v. Bell: \"Felt Necessities\" v. Fundamental Values?, 81 Col.L.Rev. 1418 (1981). In the view\nof some, the institution became the guardian of preventive segregation. See W. Wolfensberger, supra, at 60.\nC. Current Theory\nIt has now been recognized, both by experts in the field and by Congress, that the premises underlying the\nreform ideology which gave rise to institutionalization have not proven sound. Mental retardation is not solely the\nproduct of social environmental forces gone astray, as the Jacksonians once believed. It is no longer regarded as\na disease, curable or otherwise.\nThe medical model of treatment by passive care is generally being replaced throughout the country by the\ndevelopmental model. Emphasis is placed upon training to maximize potential for adjusting to as close to a\nnormal existence as is practicable. See D. Rothman, supra, at 11, 115-116, 122. Yet, the Jacksonian intuitions\nwere not entirely unfounded. While today education is not regarded as a total panacea for the mentally retarded,\nit has been recognized\nthat retarded persons, regardless of the degree of handicapping conditions, are capable of\nphysical, intellectual, emotional and social growth, and ... that a certain level of affirmative\nintervention and programming is necessary if that capacity for growth is to be preserved, and\nregression prevented.\nNew York State Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v.

Human Services, 89 N.J. 234, 445 A.2d 704 (1982).\nThe new consensus among experts, including those employed by the State of New York, recognizes the priority\nof the principle of normalization to the extent practicable. See N.Y. Office of Mental Retardation and\nDevelopmental Disabilities, Handbook of Staff Training Instructional Material, defining normalization as \"...\nmaking available to the mentally sub-normal, patterns and conditions which are as close as possible to the norms\nand patterns of the mainstream of society.\" Most modern authorities envision the placement of mentally retarded\nindividuals in a variety of residential and programmatic settings, selected in accordance with a determination of\neach person's needs and potential for living as independently and as \"normally\" as possible.\nIncreased public attention to the condition of the mentally retarded has led to marked advances in the quality and\n1307 delivery of services to them. Advocacy efforts *1307 of parents' and concerned citizens' organizations such as the\nNational Association for Retarded Children, established in 1950, see H.R.Rep. No. 694, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., \nreprinted in 1963 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad. News 1054, 1060, together with the recommendations of the President's\nCommittee on Mental Retardation, see generally H. Cohen, Trends in Service Delivery and Treatment of the\nMentally Retarded, 11 Pediatric Annals 458 (1982), have led Congress to appropriate millions of dollars for\nresearch on the causes and prevention of mental retardation, see H.R.Rep. No. 1188, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., \nreprinted in 1978 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 7312, 7358-59, to provide access for the handicapped to federally\nsubsidized programs, see Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and to codify findings\nrespecting appropriate treatment and habilitation of persons with developmental disabilities and specify\nconditions for funding state plans. See the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 6010, 6063.\nIn New York State, there has been similar concern about provision of services for the mentally retarded. The\nLegislature has specified:\n... it shall be the policy of the state to conduct research and to develop programs to further the\nprevention and early detection of mental retardation and developmental disabilities; to develop a\ncomprehensive, integrated system of services to serve the full range of needs of the mentally\nretarded and developmentally disabled by expanding the number and types of community based\nservices for the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled by serving persons in the\ncommunity as well as those in developmental centers, by improving the conditions in\ndevelopmental centers, and by establishing accountability for carrying out the policies of the state\nwith regard to the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled.\nTo accomplish these goals and meet the particular needs of the mentally retarded and\ndevelopmentally disabled, a new autonomous agency to be known as the office of mental\nretardation and developmental disabilities has been established. The office and its commissioner\nshall plan and work with local governments and voluntary organizations and all providers of\nservices to the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled to develop an effective, integrated,\ncomprehensive system for the delivery of all services to the mentally retarded and\ndevelopmentally disabled and to create financing procedures and mechanisms to support such a\nsystem of services to ensure that mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals in\nneed of service receive appropriate care and treatment close to their families and community. In\ncarrying out these responsibilities, the office and its commissioner shall make full use of existing\nservices in the community including those provided by voluntary organizations.\nAdded L.1977, c. 978, § 11, N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law § 13.01. See also N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law § 13.07\n(providing that state Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities is responsible for \"the\ndevelopment of comprehensive programs and services in the areas of research, prevention, and care, treatment,\nrehabilitation, education, and training of the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled.\"); Id. § 13.23\n(providing for education and training programs for the mentally retarded); Id. § 13.24 (providing for the funding of\nsheltered workshops, work activity and day training services); Id. § 33.03 (\"each person receiving services for\nmental disability shall receive care and treatment that is suited to his needs and skillfully, safely, and humanly\n\nadministered with full respect for his dignity and human integrity\"); Id. § 33.11 (retarded children to be provided\nthe same education \"they would otherwise be entitled to receive in their local school districts\").\nNew York has given particular attention to the concept of normalization in the least restrictive environment\npracticable. Thus,\n1308 *1308 The legislature hereby finds and determines that mentally disabled individuals have the\nright to attain the benefits of normal residential surroundings. It is further found that the\nopportunities for mentally disabled individuals will be enhanced, and the delivery of services\nimproved, by providing these individuals with the least restrictive environment that is consistent\nwith their needs, and that such environment will foster the development of maximum capabilities.\nIt is the intention of this legislation to meet the needs of the mentally disabled in New York state by\nproviding, wherever possible, that such persons remain in normal community settings, receiving\nsuch treatment, care, rehabilitation and education, as may be appropriate to each individual.\nLegislative Findings and Intent, L.1978, c. 468, § 1, quoted in N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law § 41.34. See also id. §\n41.01 (law designed to develop and expand local community programs and services).\nD. Continuing Problem\nTesting technologies, such as prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling have become increasingly refined as\npublic awareness of mental retardation grows. Yet most of the causes of retardation are still unknown.\nApproximately three percent of the population is believed to be affected; of these, 75 percent are mildly retarded,\n20 percent moderately retarded, and 5 percent severely or profoundly retarded. Acquired (non-hereditary)\ncauses, such as infection, trauma, toxins, hormonal deficiencies, severe socio-cultural deprivation, protein\nmalnutrition, and various unknown and known environmental hazards such as radiation, and lead poisoning,\naccount for at least five percent of mental retardation. See Lorincz, Perspectives on Planning for Prevention of\nMental Retardation, in Planning for Services for Handicapped Persons 78-79 (1979); Taft and Cohen, Mental\nRetardation, in Pediatrics 1769 (16th Ed.1977). Genetic causes, both those known to be due to chromosomal\nabnormalities, such as Downs syndrome, or genetically determined metabolic disorders, such as Tay-Sachs\ndisease, or endocrine disorders, of which there may be more than a thousand, are probably responsible for\nanother 20 percent. The remainder are classified as polygenic disorders, such as the fairly common neural tube\ndefects in the fetus; they may be caused by some interaction of environmental and genetic factors. See id.\nResearch in prevention has grown. Close attention is now being accorded prenatal diagnosis, through such\nmeans as amniocentesis, pulse-echo sonography (ultrasound), fetoscopy/placental aspiration (analysis of a fetal\nblood sample), and measurement of fetal protein in the amniotic fluid, particularly with mothers under age 20 and\nover age 35. See generally Antenatal Diagnosis, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, April 1979,\nat 1-10. Emphasis is also being placed on care of the unborn child by discouraging the taking of drugs, smoking\nand drinking alcohol during pregnancy; the anticipation of \"at-risk situations\" for women who have previously\nborne babies with a chromosome abnormality or with an open spine defect, or where one of the parents has a\nchromosome abnormality; and genetic counseling and screening of the newborn to prevent various retardation-\ncausing diseases, such as hypothyroidism. See Mental Retardation: Prevention Strategies That Work, Report to\nthe President (1980); Mental Retardation: The Leading Edge, Staff Report of the President's Committee on\nMental Retardation 68-71 (1978). See generally Prevention Plan, Preliminary Report, New York State, Governor's\nConference for the Prevention of Developmental Disabilities and Infant Mortality, May 1981.\nGenetic counseling, contraception, abortions and medical advances may, the testimony indicated, reduce\nsomewhat the number of retarded children in the future. But this advance may be more than counterbalanced, it\nwas suggested, by increasing chemical or radiological environmental hazards, as well as by other factors such as\n1309 the increasing tendency toward child bearing by the very young and by older women. *1309 The potential\ninterplay of these demographic, environmental and medical facts is difficult to predict. There was no\ndisagreement, however, that retardation of children will continue to be a problem. With better medical treatment\nof the retarded, their age span increases.\n\nThe result of all these developments is the likelihood that the percentage of mentally retarded and\ndevelopmentally disabled will probably not decline absolutely or as a percentage of our population. Thus, the\nlegal issues presented by this case are by no means transient or peculiar to the Center. They will be with us for\nthe foreseeable future in many guises.\nLitigations of this kind create difficult dilemmas for legislatures, executives and courts. Aiding one group may\nfurther disadvantage others. The chairman of the Mental Hygiene Committee of the New York Senate, for\nexample, noted\nmost of those [severely retarded in boarding schools] should be going to group homes. Instead,\nthese residences are being filled as soon as they open, with adults who have been living in large\ninstitutions. Many of these adults are moved because of court orders.\nBill to Help Retarded at Age 21, N.Y. Times, July 24, 1983, § 1, at 23, col. 1. With such problems in mind, the\ndecree has been formulated to permit improved services to those in the Center as well as those outside of it.\nWhat is also clear is that present professional views are not forever fixed. Home or community care is not a\npanacea, only an improvement in a difficult situation. It follows that professionals and the political system must be\nafforded considerable flexibility in meeting the new problems that undoubtedly will result from the depopulation of\nlarge institutions built when different theories prevailed.\nIII. FACTS\nA. Conditions at Suffolk Developmental Center\nThe Willowbrook Consent Decree requiring major improvements at the Staten Island Developmental Center\nbecame final in 1975. See New York State Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 393 F.Supp. 715\n(E.D.N.Y.1975). After the decree was signed, plaintiffs' witness Edward Jennings became Associate Director of\nthe Willowbrook task force organized to monitor implementation of that decree. In Jennings' words, the decree\nwas accepted by New York State \"as a guidepost to [be extended to] all of our clients across the state.\" Jennings\nis currently Director of the State Developmental Disabilities Services Office at Letchworth Developmental Center,\nresponsible for all services for the mentally retarded in Rockland, Orange and Sullivan Counties; included in his\ncharge are community-based day and residential programs. His job is equivalent to that of the Director of Suffolk\nCenter.\nIn August 1978, following the filing of the complaint in this case, Thomas Coughlin, then the State Commissioner\nof the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, asked Mr. Jennings to prepare a report\nevaluating \"problems\" then existing at the Suffolk Center. That report was issued in October 1978. While the\nreport is not in evidence, Mr. Jennings, as a witness, did describe his findings.\nJennings' testimony serves as an introduction to those problems that made conditions at the Center\nunacceptable in 1978, when this suit was commenced. He found all areas he observed deficient and concluded\nthat the Center was not \"appropriate\" for its residents. Although at the time Jennings' investigation was conducted\neach developmental center in New York State was required to use an Operational Plan for both management and\nprogrammatic purposes, the task force found that the Suffolk Developmental Center's operational plan was not\nbeing implemented. Jennings recommended that the plan be scrapped because \"[i]t wasn't a workable document\nat that time.\" Failure of the Suffolk Operational Plan in 1978 was indicative of substantial \"management\n1310 deficiencies.\" Those deficiencies suggest far more significant *1310 problems that made and continue to make\nenvironmental and programming conditions at the Center constitutionally unacceptable.\n1. Staffing\na. Direct Care Staff\n\n(1) Lack of Interaction With Clients\nIn 1978, Jennings observed a substantial lack of interaction between the clients and the direct care staff. He\nacknowledged the frequency of scenes in which residents were found sitting, rocking, lying on the floor, and\ngenerally doing nothing in front of a blaring television set in the dayroom, while the staff watched television.\nSimilarly, the federal inspection team described in their May 25, 1978 survey:\nWeekend of May 20, 21, acute care residents were in day rooms with no organized activities 00\n97\nmerely listening to ball-games on the T.V. with one staff member present.\nTo the survey team's charge that understaffing was responsible for this deficiency (and its recommendation of\nadditional staff and training programs) Center officials responded: \"Because of budget limitations, additional\nstaffing beyond what is allocated for each ward, is an impossibility.\"\nLack of interaction between staff and clients still exists. Dr. James Clements, a pediatrician and an expert in\nmental retardation, who has had responsibility for all mental retardation services in Georgia, first visited the\nCenter in the summer of 1976 as Chairman of the Willowbrook Review Panel. On February 6 and 7, 1981, and\non March 5 and 6, 1982, a few days before his testimony in this case, he visited the Center again. Clements\ndescribed his impression from his tours as follows:\nI guess the most, all pervasive feeling, impression that I got at Suffolk during this past visit and the\nother times that I had been there is that it is a place of idleness. In almost every area at Suffolk in\nwhich I visited people were sitting and waiting or lying in bed and waiting. There was virtually no\norganized activity going on in any area of Suffolk Development Center that I visited .... It is a place\nin my opinion that is harmful to every resident who resides there.\nSee photographs taken during Clements' February 1981 and March 1982 tours showing barren dayrooms;\nresidents, sometimes unclothed or partially clothed, are lying on bare floors, apparently doing nothing.\nGeorge Fearing, whose 36 year old son, Donald, has lived at the Center since 1969, testified that generally when\nhe arrived on Sundays to take Donald out for the day,\nI would find him either walking around stark naked, or walking around with a pair of dirty pants.\nThe staff were not doing anything with Donald; they were \"[s]itting in the dayroom watching television.\"\nMildred Karp, another parent who frequently visits her 30 year old daughter, Barbara, on the weekends, had\nsimilar observations of her daughter's dayroom in Ward A of Building 21:\n... there is very little activity other than sitting 00 most of the time I find my daughter sitting on the\n97\nfloor, no shoes or socks on Sometimes there are partially disrobed children, adults, they are\nadults, really most of them. Partially disrobed, doing nothing....\nThe staff \"are sitting sometimes, sometimes they are doing paperwork in the office within the ward, sometimes\nthey are doing the laundry or just sitting and watching the television.\"\nDominica Moses related that when she went to visit her sister, Nicolina Coster, at Building 4 on an August\nevening in 1981:\nAs I got out of my car at the building I heard screaming, very very loud screaming.... As I entered\nthe room, one of the residents was beating my sister. The woman who was on duty was in the\nfront of the room watching television; she never turned her head.\nLyn Rucker, an expert in mental retardation and Director of Retardation Services for sixteen counties in\nSoutheast Nebraska, visited the Center on August 27 and 28, 1982. She observed that:\n1311\n\n*1311 In the majority of the buildings, the staff were sitting, or standing away from the clients.\nThere were no, or very few contacts between staff and clients.\nBrian Lensink, another mental retardation expert who has directed Arizona's programs and services for the\nmentally retarded and developmentally disabled for seven years, visited the Center on February 14, 15 and 16,\n1982 and on September 2 and 3, 1982. Describing various residential buildings he visited during his February\n1982 tour, he found the Clients:\ngenerally sitting around the peripheries of the room rocking, self-stimulating in one way or another.\nThey were seeking a tremendous amount of attention, coming up to you, wanting to touch and\nhold. But the idleness was what affected me the most.\nThis lack of interaction has an adverse effect on clients. If there were greater staff attention they would be\nexposed to far less risk of injury. Negative behavior often continues uninterrupted, permitting the clients with\nbehavior problems to harm themselves, as well as other clients around them.\nMental retardation expert Kathleen Schwaninger, formerly responsible for all services to the mentally retarded in\nMassachusetts and now executive director of a voluntary agency providing programmatic and residential services\nto the retarded in New York City, testified at length. She most recently inspected the Center on March 17 and\nApril 2, 1982. While there she observed inappropriate behavior in the lunchroom such as clients \"getting up from\nthe table and moving around,\" and \"grabbing food.\" During the meal, \"the staff did not interrupt the clients or\ndirect them to a positive meal time behavior....\"\nClients are denied the opportunity to learn to relate to other human beings. Thus, Brian Lensink noted that the\nresidents\nhave no opportunity to meet normal people. One of the best training devices we know of is\nmodeling, observing other people's behavior and modeling it, doing it yourself. And we give the\npeople in a large setting like that every opportunity to model inappropriate behavior ... and very\nfew opportunities to model appropriate behavior.\nA number of factors explain this problem: particularly the insufficient number of staff, the use of a staffing system\nbased on \"critical minimum\" requirements, and the lack of adequate staff training. One symptom of lack of trained\nstaff is the excessive use of direct care aides known as floaters. They are shifted from ward to ward as shortages\nof staff develop. The result is that they often do not know the client's needs and it becomes more difficult to\nmaintain any consistent training program. For retarded children, to a far greater extent than in the case of normal\nchildren, uniform patterns of conduct and predictable relationships with people that care for them are essential.\nThese criticisms should not obscure the genuine love, concern, and commitment which a great many of the direct\ncare staff have for the clients and their welfare. Like Margie Grant, many of the staff are hooked on the clients.\nConsidering the obstacles they face, staff members are to be commended for doing as well as they do.\nNevertheless, even the most well-meaning staff cannot be expected to perform adequately when they are\ninsufficient in number, poorly trained and supervised, and unfamiliar with the plans developed for the clients.\n(2) Insufficient Number of Staff\n(a) The Number of Direct Care Staff\nEdward Jennings testified that a minimum staffing ratio of 1.78 to 1 overall was necessary to provide the state-\nmandated six hours of programming each day to each resident and to insure adequate and appropriate care.\nAccording to Mr. Jennings, an optimal ratio would be 2.2 or 2.1 to 1. Fred A. McCormack, Director of the Center,\ntestified that 1.83 \"is professionally desirable.\" He pointed out, however, that the state provided only the 1.78\n1312 level. In 1978 the *1312 staffing ratio at the Center was only 1.56 to 1, substantially below what defendants and\n\ndefendants' experts have testified to be the minimum required for adequate care. And in March 1982, the ratio\nwas 1.72 00 still below that minimum.\n97\nThese ratios are more than abstract numbers. An increase of .1 in the staffing ratio translates into an additional\n120 staff members since the population presently is roughly 1,200 clients. This number of added workers can\nhave an enormous impact on client care.\nZygmond Slezak, Acting Commissioner of the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities for the\nState of New York, acknowledged that no developmental center in the State of New York has a lower staff ratio\nthan the Suffolk Center and many have a higher one.\nPlaintiffs' experts, all of whom are qualified professionals in the field of mental retardation, each spent at least two\ndays, usually more, visiting the Center in 1982. They found insufficient direct care staff to meet the needs of the\nclients, thereby increasing the likelihood of injuries and of the acquisition or aggravation of self-stimulating or\nother negative behavior. Maria Saracino, a direct care staff worker at the Center agreed:\nI feel greatly that the amount of staff that has been allocated to us is not sufficient to take care of\nthe amount of residents.... They should be receiving better care, and more staff is definitely one\nway it could be accomplished.\nFor example, Lisa Gorelick, one of the named plaintiffs, a profoundly retarded resident of the Center, has a pair of\nexpensive orthopedic braces, without which she cannot attempt to learn to walk. She is not able to wear her\nbraces because there is not enough staff to make sure she does not fall over when she wears them. The result is\nthat Lisa remains in a wheelchair though she should not.\nJoseph Ryan, the Deputy Director of the Center, responsible for its daily operations, acknowledged that more\nstaff is needed to maintain an acceptable level of care. See 1982-83 Budget Request for Suffolk Developmental\nCenter made by the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disability as Submitted to Executive\nDepartment.\n(b) Impact on the Clients\nDirect care staff must often devote their limited time to various housekeeping tasks such as laundry and making\nbeds, so that even though they are present on the wards, they are prevented from interacting with the clients.\nThe result is that staff does not have the time to actively teach clients self-care skills such as toileting and how to\nwash, dress and feed themselves. As Margie Grant, a mental hygiene therapy aide testified, rather than teaching\na client to brush his or her teeth, the staff person does it, because there is no time for the patient training that is\nrequired. She testified as follows:\nQ Have you ever been trained in techniques to teach residents who can't dress themselves, to do\nany of those skills?\nA No.... We don't have time with the number of staff to give the clients time to learn, or even to do\nit.... How can you do that in a given time, hand him the toothbrush, and give him the toothpaste,\nand wait. You must be patient in this job. But what you do, you end up brushing the teeth\nthemselves, because they get brushed that way....\nQ Is that the same situation with bathing them, combing their hair?\nA Absolutely. There is not sufficient time to do that....\nQ You indicated that you knew of some goal plans?\nA Yes, but they were never worked on.\nThe staff's role is generally to do for the clients, rather than to teach and help the clients do for themselves. As\nexpert Kathleen Schwaninger testified:\n\n1313 Q Is there a difference between training or programming on the one hand and *1313 doing for the\nclient on the other hand, dressing the client, feeding the client?\nA There is much difference between that, and it is probably best described as analogous as to\nhow we raise our own infants.... That same kind of teaching pattern applies to mentally retarded\nindividuals....\nQ If retarded people are not divided into the kind of programming that you just described, in your\nopinion what would be the effect on them?\nA They will not develop to their full capacity.... Typically they will lose skills.\nThus, the lack of enough staff often denies the clients the most effective kind of learning experience for the\nacquisition of self-care skills in such basic areas as toileting, eating, washing and dressing. Such opportunities\nare particularly crucial in the learning process of mentally retarded persons, said Ms. Schwaninger,\nbecause the symptomology of mental retardation is that the individuals learn much slower.... In\nother words, if you put one shoe on a mentally retarded individual and he learns to tie that\nparticular shoe and a week later you place a different shoe on his foot, most of the time the\nindividual will not make the association with being able to tie his shoe....\nBecause, one of the symptoms of mental retardation is the presence of short-term memory. In\norder to compensate for these folks not being able to remember as well as we do, and retain it,\npractice and a great deal of practice for retention purposes is necessary.\nWithout consistent reinforcement in the residential context of the skills acquired at day programs, the skills are\ngenerally lost. As Joel Levy, director of a private voluntary agency providing residential and day program services\nto the mentally retarded, including the multiply handicapped and profoundly retarded, in New York City and\nWestchester County, put the matter:\nWithout the day treatment program the residential program would be doomed to failure. Without\nsome support at home, whether it is in the home with the parents or within the residential program\n[the day program] also would be doomed to failure. Such opportunities for consistent practice of\nself-care skills are built into the community living environment.\nPhyllis Killigrew, a member of the direct care staff at the Center since the spring of 1981, described the work of\nthe direct care staff generally as \"... more like custodial care 00 babysitting.\"\n97\nWhen Kathleen Schwaninger spoke to the direct care staff on her visits to the Center, they \"reported consistently\nthat their job is to take care. In other words, wash people. Clean people up. Toilet them. Not train them.\" Ms.\nSchwaninger attributed this custodial view to a number of factors: 1) staff members are not given training that will\nequip them to teach the clients; 2) insufficient staff leaves no free time to devote to teaching clients; 3) staff does\nnot recognize that it is expected to teach; 4) there is a widespread perception that only the professional staff are\ncapable of training the clients; and 5) there is a natural inhibition against communicating with clients who\nthemselves are non-verbal.\nThere is also the self-fulfilling prophecy of client incapability. As Brian Lensink commented,\nI looked at a lot of residents and I was informed that the vast majority of the people there were\nprofoundly retarded. The numbers, in fact, were 900 profoundly retarded; 250 severely retarded;\n100 moderately; and 50 mildly.... I felt most of those folks had more potential than what was\nindicated from the figures. [But t]he staff has expectations established for them that I think are\nmuch lower than could be established.\nOn many occasions even the custodial function goes unfulfilled. This is evident in Lyn Rucker's description of the\nlunchroom in Building 28 on a Saturday in late August, 1982:\n\nI think this is one of the hardest experiences for me on this particular tour, in that you had 84\n1314 individuals in a lunchroom *1314 trying to eat, staff that were trying to assist as best they could;\nbut I saw no active feeding programs.... And there were other people making attempts to feed\nthemselves, and the staff person was standing there doing nothing. And then they grab the hand\nand shove it up to their mouth and say eat.... I felt sorry for everybody in that room, and especially\nthe gentleman with the pureed food being slapped into his face.\nMs. Rucker also described another scene, in Building 27, in which she observed and heard through a glass wall a\nsixteen year old hydrocephalic resident in a cart with wooden sides banging her head, very severely, against the\ncart. The staff did nothing to stop this potentially very harmful behavior until the official with whom Ms. Rucker\nwas touring interceded.\nUntil recently, psychotropic drugs and various kinds of physical restraints were used, and misused, to control\nbehavior since there was not enough staff to work with clients on behavior modification programs. Judy Walker,\nwho has worked at the Center for over fifteen years, and is currently the nursing program coordinator, testified\nthat in 1978 residents were being regularly given thorazine and other drugs for behavior control purposes. Drugs\nwere used she said, \"because we had no other alternatives. Right now we can afford and we do take clients off\nmedication because we have treatment plans. Then we didn't have treatment plans. We didn't have intervention.\"\nToday there are still between 600 and 900 Center clients out of a population of 1,200 who receive some form of\npsychotropic drug. Liver damage has been detected in several residents due to the large amounts of medication\ngiven them.\nAmbulatory clients are still locked into wheelchairs or confined in them by tabletop lap boards. Lyn Rucker\ntestified, based on her visit to the Center in late September 1982, that clients are subjected to an unnecessary\ndegree of physical restriction. Brian Lensink agreed with Ms. Rucker and added:\nYou probably would not need the medications or the other kinds of restraint programs if you were\nto give the person the programming in the first place. Occupy his time and give him something\nproductive with his time. Many of these behaviors are for the opportunity to get attention. They\nbecome quite well learned and extremely difficult to deal with when they have been reinforced or\nnot dealt with in the appropriate manner in the first place.\n(c) Use of the \"Critical Minimum\" and of \"Floating\" Staff\nThe Center Policy Manual defines \"Critical Staffing Numbers\":\nEach ward has been assigned a specific number of employees that must be on duty to maintain\nlife and safety standards of the clients. When staffing falls below this critical number, pool staff\nand/or overtime shall be used.... No unit shall schedule staff at or below critical numbers.\nMarian Ball, who was Acting Director of the Center from February through August 1980 understood that\nthe critical number was to be that number of employees on duty at any particular building or ward,\nit would be the bottom line, no more no less. That is the least amount of employees that should be\non duty.\nThough intended only for emergency situations, or as a last resort, the wards at the Center are often staffed only\nby the critical minima. Brian Lensink testified that \"[m]ost cottages were at critical minimum when we asked.\"\nDeputy Director Ryan agreed that the Center often has a hard time providing the requisite critical numbers. Use\nof 16 hour shifts were, as a result, not uncommon. He claimed that those who work such shifts \"are not\ncompletely exhausted.\" Nevertheless, it can come as no surprise that there are substantial morale problems\namong the direct care staff at the Center. As Kathleen Schwaninger observed,\n\n1315 [t]he staff gets very tired. Staff has to work overtime, can work two shifts, or *1315 are asked to\nwork two shifts. Consequently, their interest and their desire for their effectiveness in working with\nclients is compromised. Sometimes staff will even fall asleep....\nThe director, Mr. McCormack, referred to the continuing problems of staff attendance and overtime. Defendants'\nexperts, all qualified professionals, testified that the use of critical numbers staffing for extended periods of time is\nharmful.\nCritical minima were not always met. Two or three staff workers for 24-30 residents was a situation observed by\nseveral of the clients' relatives who testified. This low ratio was noted by some of the experts, including\ndefendants' expert Hugh Sage, superintendent of a state developmental center in Nebraska, who asserted that\nthere was not enough staff to provide even minimal care.\nStaff absences and high turnover continue to be a significant problem. Floating staff, that is staff that is not\nassigned to the particular ward and is unfamiliar with the residents, must frequently be employed to make up the\ncritical minimum. Use of floating staff is almost constant in some wards.\nThe effect of such transient workers can be dangerous, leading to situations in which floating staff, unfamiliar with\na ward's residents, will mistakenly give medications intended for one client to another. Since floaters are usually\nunfamiliar with the ward's residents, client interaction and effective implementation of programming becomes\nmore difficult and less likely to occur. As Margie Grant, a member of the Center's direct care staff for three and a\nhalf years, testified, floating\nis demoralizing, because you go on a ward where you don't know the clients, and they don't know\nyou.... They get, like, hyper if you have floats.... The work is not kept up.\nUse of floating staff makes it difficult to create an environment in which learning can occur. The practice generally\nundermines any possibility of effective programming or reinforcement of skills. Brian Lensink commented\nadversely on the use of floaters to make up the critical minimum:\nThere is no way they will have the time to brief themselves on a plan if they can find a plan on\nwhat they should be doing with those residents.... There is no way that they [the critical minimum\nstaff] can spend any time trying to stimulate or educate or train or even attend the residents when\nthere are that many.\nAs noted, the mentally retarded have a greater need for consistency in the way they are taught. Brian Lensink\nexplained that \"the retarded person has a harder time picking it up in the first place, and could forget it much\neasier if it's not reinforced.\" Not only does this require residential reinforcement of what is taught at the day\nprogram, but it also necessitates consistency of staffing so that in carrying out the hands-on training by which\nmany self-care skills are taught, hands are laid on in the same way. Floaters generally cannot work with the\nclients on reinforcement of the skills taught in the day programs because they are not familiar with those\nprograms, or the goals and methodologies described in each client's developmental plan.\n(3) Inadequate Staff Training\nMost programming is devised by clinicians such as psychiatrists, doctors, physical therapists, speech therapists\nand occupational therapists. Implementation, especially in the most basic areas 00 toileting, eating, washing and\n97\ndressing 00 is largely the responsibility of the direct care staff. When direct care staff lacks the time, the familiarity\n97\nwith residents and the interest to effectively implement such programming, it cannot succeed.\nAn equally critical factor undermines staff efforts at programming, even among those who care about the clients\nfor whom they are responsible and who would like to work with them. Simply put, many, if not most, direct care\nstaff have not received sufficient training.\n1316 All newly-hired direct care staff at the Center now receive some 200 hours of classroom *1316 orientation. That\ntraining, according to direct care worker Phyllis Killigrew, who recently received it, includes \"very, very little\"\n\nhands on training. Although she characterized her classwork as \"adequate,\" she felt that it did not prepare her for\nthe reality on the ward.\nEverything was not the way it was supposed to be. I wasn't able to do all the things that I was\ntaught in orientation.... I was being frustrated at every turn. These people that I work with on ten-B\n00 need a spokesman, someone to say that the quality of life and conditions on this ward 00 and I\n97 97\nspeak for this ward, are horrendous.\nMargie Grant, another direct care staff person who spoke positively of the orientation, described it \"like fantasy\"\ncompared to what she later found on the ward. Ms. Grant who has worked on Ward C, Building 28 for the last two\nyears, and who has been at the Center for four years, testified that she had never been trained to teach residents\nto dress themselves, or to perform any other basic self-care skills. Judy Walker, the nursing program coordinator,\nagreed that the direct care staff has never been taught to institute toilet training programs.\nNor is there any requirement of in-service staff training, despite the defendants' seemingly impressive array of\ncourse offerings. See Suffolk Developmental Center 1981 Catalogue of Education and Training Programs. As the\n1980 Bureau of Staff Development & Training Management Plan put it:\nPerhaps the major flaw in defining the legal basis of training is the total absence of a rational,\ncomprehensive organizational policy regarding staff development. The policy directives cited in\nthe report deal with two isolated issues. There is no written policy(s) regarding: (a) the scope of\nresponsibility for training both at the central office and facility level, (b) the procedures and\nmechanisms to be utilized in order to properly carry out these responsibilities, and (c) the\ncoordination of central office and local level activities for staff development. Such a policy is\nessential and should be written.... The lack of a rational, overall OMRDD policy regarding staff\ndevelopment is an extremely unfortunate situation.\nOnly thirteen Center employees have actually availed themselves of in-service courses.\nIn any event, it is questionable whether an institution already as understaffed as the Center could actually spare\nits badly needed staff for in-service training. As Judy Walker commented:\nWe are a big institution and we can't stop and freeze and say to a group of old employees and\nnew employees we will take you out as a group and sit and train you.... Who is going to take care\nof the client?\nFor those members of the direct care staff who either received no training or were trained under the \"medical\nmodel,\" using physiological therapy and designed to keep the client relatively passive, programming, intended to\nactively train the client for as normal a lifestyle as possible, may be an unfamiliar concept and, therefore, even\nmore difficult to implement. Judy Walker who has trained therapy aides and the nursing staff for fifteen years at\nthe Center noted:\n... We have some problems with [staff training] ... We have therapy aides who have been with us a\nvery long time 00 since we first opened.... We have a core of therapy aides who started out in the\n97\nvery beginning when we had this medical [model] knowledge.... I never trained them in this\ndevelopmental model and then we have some who came halfway between when we were making\nthe change. And we have some new therapy aides who come out of class fully convinced that the\ndevelopmental model is the only one and they are right....\nMark Davis, Deputy Director for Treatment Services of the East Campus at the Center, admitted that it will take at\nleast two more years to sufficiently train the staff in new methods of programming. Fred McCormack, the Director,\n1317 similarly acknowledged *1317 that staff attitudes, though improving, still have some way to go:\nThey're doing more things for clients at this point. They're still not where they would like to be.\nThere is more interaction. There's more expectation of people participating in programming. And\nthey're beginning to do more things.... They're still not there.\n\n(4) Lack of Adequate Staff Supervision\nThe effect of inadequate staff training is intensified by a lack of adequate staff supervision. As a new staff\nmember, Phyllis Killigrew testified:\nQ. Since the completion of your orientation, have you had additional training from any supervisor\nor anyone else at S.D.C.?\nA. Not really no.\nQ. What about supervision? Are you supervised by team leader or mid-level supervisor on a\nregular basis in the ward?\nA. No.\nQ. Are you shown what to do or told what to do?\nA. No.\nThis failure is probably due in part to the inadequate number of mid-level supervisors and clinicians. Like the\ndirect care staff, clinicians' responsibilities are spread thin, leaving them little time for staff supervision and\ntraining. Maria Saracino, a direct care staff person in Building 28, Ward C, testified:\nQ. Do you have a supervisor that works with you on a regular basis in your ward?\nA. No....\nQ. How frequently would you say a team leader or therapist is with you ... on the ward?\nA. A few minutes maybe, on a given day; sometimes not that much.\n(5) Lack of Staff Familiarity With, or Access to, Individual Plans of\nClients\nWhen particular programs (DVPs) and strategies of goal-implementation have been devised for individual clients,\nmany direct care staff workers are unaware of them. Expert Lyn Rucker testified that,\nWhen asking the direct care staff, what type of programmatic interventions ... were taking place, or\nif they had access in one particular case to a physical therapist, whether a person should be\nwearing the orthopedic shoes, the response in both those cases, it was, no; they did not have\naccess and there were no programs.\nAnd even when the staff did know that specific programs for certain clients existed, the programs were frequently\ninaccessible and thus of little value. Brian Lensink testified,\n[W]hen I was in the workshops I asked could I see a copy of the client's DVP so I knew what was\nsupposed to be working in the workshop environment, and except for on a rare occasion they\nalways said the DVP is in the residence and we don't have a copy of it here, and therefore you will\nhave to go to the residence to find out what the person's goals were.\nWell, it didn't do very much good in the residence because a program that was being operated\nwas in the workshop or the educational program...., but when I ask the direct care staff [in the\nresidence], almost without exception they didn't know what the plans were anyway. If they did,\nthey said they were carrying it on in the workshop. It was a very confusing process that seemed to\nbe of little benefit to either location.\n\nStaff that is not trained in programming cannot work with the clients to develop basic skills. This failure, in turn,\nincreases the risk of harm to the client. Defendants' expert Richard Blanton testified that the implementation of\nprogramming for some clients \"is a life or death matter.\" Without the necessary programming, clients may\ndevelop destructive behaviors. Rose Maggio's son, Michael, who was never provided a program to curb his pica\nbehavior 00 an abnormal craving to eat non-foods 00 died from ingesting plastic gloves left around the ward.\n97 97\n1318 Without a staff that has been *1318 trained and has the time to implement such programs, they cannot be\nimplemented.\nb. Inadequate Clinical Staff\nThe inadequacy of the direct care staff training is in part explained by the fact that there is not enough clinical\nstaff to train them. Both plaintiffs' and defendants' experts, as well as the clients' parents, agreed on the shortage\nof clinical staff, and particularly of physical, occupational, and speech therapists.\nBased on interviews with staff, Kathleen Schwaninger testified that the shortage of physical and occupational\ntherapists prevented many clients who needed various therapies from receiving them. Even defendants' expert,\nHugh Sage, noted, \"In some instances there were staff shortages and critical deficiencies in some kinds of\ndisciplines.\"\nLyn Rucker never saw any doctors or therapists on the wards in visiting nine buildings over two days in August,\n1982. Judy Walker, the head of nursing at the Center, stated that there is only one doctor on call for the entire\nCenter at night; only two on weekends. For many years there was only one dentist. Only recently was a second\ndentist added to care for the 1,200 client population.\nAnthony Mariano, a treatment team leader in Building 28, said there was an inadequate ratio of one psychiatrist\nfor 82 clients in Building 28 and that no more had been requested. Despite this, the Director, Fred McCormack,\nacknowledged that there are immediate plans to terminate at least nine psychiatrists currently working at the\nCenter. Lack of speech therapists is a serious problem. See infra.\nc. Hiring Process\nCrucial to the staffing problems at the Center are the hiring administrative procedures and policies. These are\ndevised by the state.\nFunds for hiring become available in the following way: The Director of the Center submits a budget request to\nthe Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities in Albany which forwards that request as part of\nits own to the state legislature according to the testimony of Robert Norris, First Deputy Commissioner of the New\nYork State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. Once the appropriations are made, the\nState Division of the Budget, which is part of the Governor's Office, has some control over expenditures\naccording to testimony of Zygmond Slezak, Acting Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities.\nJoseph Ryan, Deputy Director of the Center testified that the Center required more staff to maintain an\nacceptable level of care. He also admitted that there are areas which had no physical therapy staff. See Draft\nPolicy Memorandum on \"Physical Therapy Service 00 Evaluation Procedure,\" February 1982. Yet, according to\n97\nMarvin Colson, Deputy Director of Institutional Administration, there is a hiring freeze in effect. Director Fred\nMcCormack denied that during his tenure there has been a state-imposed hiring freeze 00 he referred to the\n97\nsituation as a restriction on hiring he has imposed himself. The effect, however, is the same as a freeze since the\npurpose of Mr. McCormack's restriction is to avoid the state bureaucracy's penalties for overstepping stringent\nand apparently inadequate state staffing ratios.\nWe haven't been able to hire.... I impose it 00 very simply the reason for imposing it, the freeze,\n97\nwas that if you go over two pay periods in a row over your authorized staffing basis of 1.78, you\n\nget a Division of Budget freeze enforced. And I'd rather have my own restrictions on hiring than\nhave to go through the tremendous bureaucratic procedure to overcome that.\n2. Programming\nAs already indicated, it is generally accepted among professionals in the field that constant and consistently\n1319 reinforced programming is necessary for the mentally retarded to acquire those self-care skills essential *1319 to\nthe most basic kind of development and human interaction. The clients' lack of long-term memory requires\nconstant practice of skills in the ward residential setting as well as in the more structured educational sessions.\nConsistency must be maintained seven days a week, twelve months a year. Every staff and professional person\nmust work towards defined behavior goals if habit patterns are to be formed.\nThe formal aspect of client education and training is mandated by state law. In New York, all clients in state\ninstitutions for the mentally retarded are entitled to six full hours of formal programming a day, unless they are\nspecifically designated as medically exempt. There are between 20 and 50 medical exemptions among the\napproximately 1,200 clients currently at the Center.\nClients under age 21 must be provided \"a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education\nand related services designed to meet their unique needs.\" Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400\n(c) (Supp.1983). See Sherry v. New York State Education Department, 479 F.Supp. 1328, 1335 (W.D.N.Y.1979). \nSee also Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794. At the Center 135 of those clients under age\n21 go to county-wide programs for the disabled in the local Half Hollow School District. 94 clients under age 21\ncannot go off the grounds for programs.\nThe majority of Center clients are over age 21 and rely on the Center to place them in programs either on or off\nthe grounds. The stated goal of the administration is to get all of the clients out of their wards and into a different\nenvironment for programming. Yet more than 300 clients remain in their wards during the day as well as at night.\nWhatever the goals of the institution and the requirements of law, programming at the Center falls short. Margie\nGrant testified that in Building 28, Ward C, where she works, approximately 14 (out of 20) clients that do not\nleave the building for programming receive no program at all. Brian Lensink said that he saw no programs in any\nof the residential units. He noted that the direct care staff with whom such residents remain on the wards, as well\nas those who accompany the residents to their on-ground programs in other buildings, are not trained in\neducational programming.\nBoth on and off the wards, there are simply not enough programs to accommodate all of the residents. Such\nprogramming was not available to all residents of the Center in 1978 when this lawsuit began. It is not available\nto all the residents today.\nHalf of the adult residents were not getting six hours per day, on or off campus, in 1980. Half were not getting six\nhours when the trial began 00 unless they were members of the \"Willowbrook class.\" In March 1982, including\n97\nthose involved in the central workshop program, \"satellite\" workshops, the Building 9 educational and workshop\nprograms, and the living unit classrooms, fewer than 400 of the 1,000 adult residents were participating in any\nformal program at the facility.\nPerhaps 70 to 100 adults went off-campus for day programming. While this practice is recognized as desirable in\nitself and as preparation for community living, opportunities for such programming are rare in part because of the\nfacility's transportation problems. A lack of community resources also contributes to off-campus programming\nfailures.\nParents and relatives who testified unanimously indicated that once their children or siblings passed the age of\npublic school eligibility (if not before), any programming they received was sporadic, inconsistent, and therefore\nineffective. What little these clients did receive was often due to their families' efforts, not the institution's. Several\nparents used their own or client's funds to hire a tutor to work with the residents.\n\nResident Laura Knapp went without a program for five years after reaching the age of 21, until suddenly being\nenrolled in a workshop during the trial. Additionally, she pays for a tutor out of her own funds.\n1320 *1320 In some cases, the Center, as representative payee for the client's Supplemental Security Income or other\nbenefits, makes the decision to use client funds for tutoring programs. When the client or his or her family lacks\nthe funds, no tutor is available.\nThere is no objection to stretching the institution's resources with private funds. But those without funds or caring\nrelatives cannot be denied programming. Differences in affluence which may be acceptable in an open society\ncreate severe inequities when imposed on those confined to institutions, with no power or capacity to aid\nthemselves. This is neither equality in fact nor equality of opportunity.\nThe quality of existing formal programs at the Center may be described as uneven to inadequate. For example,\nDr. Clements saw a program in Building 3 in March 1982, in which six staff tried to work with 21 residents in an\natmosphere of noise and confusion, using reinforcement techniques that might have been appropriate for some\nof the clients but certainly not for all of them. It could not be immediately determined which approaches would be\nappropriate for which clients, since the relevant plans and records were inaccessible. The Building 3 activities\nobserved by Dr. Clements were examples of group exercises, not the individually designed programs that the\nclients needed.\nIn the Building 16 units, housing \"acute\" and \"chronic\" clients, the written program for most consisted of physical\ntherapy. The staff was said to be trained in physical therapy techniques, but when asked for a demonstration, it\nevinced no familiarity with proper procedure.\nThe experts agreed that in too many cases the lack of programming has resulted in injury to the clients.\na. Toileting\nBoth plaintiffs' and defendants' experts testified to the overwhelming need for toileting programs. Brian Lensink\nsaw no toilet training programs during his five days of visits to the Center in February and September, 1982. Lyn\nRucker was surprised by the great number of individuals in diapers. Marian Ball testified that while she was at the\nCenter many of those who required toileting programs did not receive them.\nThe Center's \"Daily In Patient Census Summary,\" dated March 5, 1982, shows that of the approximately 1,200\nclients, 800 were in need of, and not receiving, toileting programs. Phyllis Killigrew, a member of the direct care\nstaff, testified that she never knew of any \"official\" toileting programs. When toileting programs did exist, they\nwere implemented sporadically and without the accompanying reinforcement on the ward necessary for them to\nbe effective. The graphic testimony of parents confirms this failure.\nThe case of Dennis Silverman illustrates the need for consistent, continued training. He is a 37 year old resident\nof Building 16, who has gone to a community day program for seven years. He is trained to tell someone when\nhe needs the toilet, and does tell someone at the day program. Yet there is often no one on the ward to hear him\nso he wets himself. Recently, his parents in an evening visit found Dennis, wet, near the nurses' station, \"sitting\non a bed of cockroaches.\" Silverman's situation is thus not much better than that of Tommy Czerniewicz, and\nothers who have never been in any toileting program. Ironically, the widespread implementation of toilet training\nwould benefit the staff, as well as the clients, since it would free them from some of the housekeeping tasks they\nmust now engage in, and give them more time to work with clients.\nSkills once acquired are lost at the Center. Several parents testified that clients who were continent at the time\nthey were admitted lost control during the course of their continued residence at the Center.\nb. Behavior Modification\nBehavior modification programs at the Center for the large number of clients who require them are inadequate. In\n1321 1978, Edward Jennings found that provision of behavior *1321 modification programs for residents \"was grossly\n\ninadequate.\" He agreed that the absence of such programs, particularly for those residents with self-abusive and\nself-stimulating behaviors \"could be very injurious.\"\nMarian Ball testified that not all of those who required behavior modification programs received them, and that\nbecause programming was insufficient, drugs were often used to control behavior. Barbara Karp, who has been\nat the Center since 1972, never received any programming for her hair-pulling and head-banging. Instead, in her\nmother's words, she was given \"more and more drugs\" and thus \"is, to this day, addicted to valium, and they\ncould not take her off it because she had such tremors you could not touch this child.\"\nAccording to defendants' expert Richard Blanton, who is responsible for residential programs for the\ndevelopmentally disabled in Illinois, without adequate training clients can easily develop or aggravate harmful\nbehaviors. That consistent and reinforced programming is, in fact, crucial, is made plain by the death, already\nadverted to, of Rose Maggio's son, Michael, one of a number of Center residents who demonstrated pica\nbehavior. Michael was not consistently trained to avoid eating foreign objects.\nKathleen Schwaninger testified that the Center was not providing sufficient training for those with self-abusive\nbehavior. Often the staff did not even interrupt the clients' negative behaviors. Janet Stutz, who screams and\nbangs her chin, has never received any programming for either behavior. Lisa Gorelick has lost all sight in one\neye due to a cataract caused by head-banging.\nA few clients identified as having behavior problems that would be likely to result in harm to themselves and to\nother clients, have a direct care staff worker assigned to them on a one-to-one basis. Incredibly, staff assigned to\nthis one-to-one duty may not know of the specific behavior problems of their clients; rarely are they informed of\nany program designed to overcome the problem.\nJulie Mary Dean, who throws chairs and otherwise acts in a disruptive manner, has a staff member assigned to\nher on a one-to-one basis. Expert Brian Lensink testified:\nI asked her [the one-to-one] what her responsibility was and she said it is to 00 she is supposed to\n97\nstop the behavior.\nShe was not trained in how to work with Julie May. She did not know what she was to do for sure\nother than she was to stop that obnoxious behavior.... Even though [Julie] was assigned to the day\nprogram her behavior was too obnoxious to allow her to attend and when she did attend [the\ndirect-care staff] didn't know what she did.... It is injurious in that she is not getting the training or\nthe benefit in relation to the expenditure that is being made.\nThe testimony of Maria Saracino, a member of the direct care staff in Building 28, Ward C, confirmed the dangers\nto clients created by lack of programming and failure to train staff:\nWe have two particular clients that have been constant behavior problems.... They have to be\nunder very constant supervision because they are hitters, they're scratchers, they are biters....\nthey have caused a problem on the ward, because our other clients are ... small in stature, and\nunable to defend themselves against them.... We have repeatedly, every single day, brought this\nto the attention of the doctor, the nurse, the team leader, the chief of service.... Quite often the\nother clients are bitten to a point that the skin is broken and they have received a bad bruise.\nThey are hit against the wall or knocked off a chair where they are badly bruised.\nThey have been scratched where the skin has been opened up, and badly hurt in that manner....\nBecause we have brought it to the attention of the psychologist and the previous team leader, a\nprogram was begun to be worked out.\nIt did not come about because we had a change of team leader, and it has not been yet\nactivated....\n1322 *1322 Q Were you folks trained in how to implement what was written on paper?\n\nA No. We were not.\nLyn Rucker found that staff \"were not aware of any active programming going on to eliminate those [self-abusive]\nbehaviors.\"\nEven for those clients who began without them, lack of programming may lead to behavior problems according to\ntestimony of Brian Lensink. Direct care staff person Elle Ambrose acknowledged that Russell Cohen is not self-\nabusive when he is kept occupied. Many clients have developed harmful or inappropriate habits, such as head-\nbanging, eye-gouging and biting themselves, which may be caused by boredom, and an unstimulating\nenvironment.\nThe environment of a large institution may exacerbate dangerous behavior because of an \"inability to provide\nenough attention to people and the way people get the attention they seek is acting out behaviors ...,\" according\nto Kathleen Schwaninger. Moreover, clients will pick up each other's inappropriate behaviors in order to receive\nattention that would otherwise not be forthcoming. Thus, the failure to provide a behavior modification or other\nprogram for one client with negative behavior, may encourage the acquisition of such behavior by other clients.\nPractically every parent or relative that testified described the serious injuries they found when visiting. For\nexample, Lisa Gorelick, said her mother,\nhas had two broken collarbones, she has had one broken finger when the residents slammed the\ndoor on her finger, and she had another finger injury.... She was once bitten on the buttocks when\nthe children were showered in an assembly line fashion and she was through being showered....\nShe has had black eyes, she almost always has bruises on her forehead from banging her\nhead....\nWhen Donald Fearing visits the Center, he checks his son's body.\nI have found that invariably he is scratched from head to foot.... He ... had a terrible wound on his\nelbow.... he had a broken nose twice.... He has had at least six injuries ... requiring stitches ...\nmainly around his head area.... [as a result of] personal attacks by another resident.\nBarbara Karp's mother reported Barbara has\nsuffered a broken upper arm.... She has had head injuries, she has had stitches on her head and\nforehead, scratches around the eyes, bleeding from the ear.... and bites.\nBefore Michael Maggio died he had a fractured wrist, and many bites on his body. Once Mr. and Mrs. Maggio\nsaw their son naked, being choked by another boy as an attendant sat by and watched.\nThe scene of Nicolina Coster being beaten by a resident while the person on duty watched television has already\nbeen described. Nicolina was again hit by a resident the following month. When Mrs. Moses went to see her\nsister two days later,\nHer face was covered with black and blue marks. Her chest, upper chest and her back were black\nand blue. Her front tooth was missing.... She was pulling the hair out of her head.\nAs I came in, she jumped up in the seat and she said, \"Help me, help me. Please help me.\" She\nwas also doing that to one of the other workers.\nHer leg was ... as big as my entire body. A worker told me that she had not slept since the\nbeating....\nSince then, Nicolina has also had her nose broken.\nRobert Stutz, who \"was constantly being pushed and shoved,\" has had 31 stitches over his eyes, and now \"has\nso much scar tissue here, that he has lumps over his eyes....\" Thus, the result of the lack of appropriate\n\nprogramming is that many clients, whose negative behaviors harm both themselves and other clients, live in an\nenvironment that cannot protect them from harm.\n1323 Even when a good program is begun it often ends abruptly when funds for personnel *1323 are cut back. Where\nprograms do exist, they are often sporadic; they have \"started and ended rather abruptly.\"\nc. Feeding\nEqually crucial to safeguarding the life of a client are feeding programs in which appropriate chewing and\nswallowing behaviors are taught. Without such programs, there is an increased probability that clients will choke.\nThis risk is increased by staff feeding supine clients. When Kathleen Schwaninger visited Wards 3-A and B of\nBuilding 16,\nStaff were not stimulating any swallowing or chewing techniques with clients. They were putting\nthe food in the clients mouths.\nOne client was being fed in a supine position and that is significantly inappropriate for a client with\nthese types of physically disabling conditions.... A person is flat on their back, and if they do not\nswallow or have trouble swallowing they begin choking on their food.... A client can aspirate and\ndie, choke and die.... What happens is that either the food doesn't go down or the food goes\npartially down or the food comes back up and starts getting in the client's breathing apparatus.... It\nleads to choking, it leads to the client not being able to get oxygen to breathe.\nNeither did Lyn Rucker see any active feeding programs.\nThere are not enough feeding programs being carried out at the Center. Even in Building 9, one of the buildings\nspecially reconverted for use for education, Kathleen Schwaninger found that mealtimes are not learning\nexperiences. She observed one exception in which a teacher was working with one client during lunch in the\nschool building to overcome food-grabbing and food-shoveling behaviors. When this same client was observed\neating in her residence, Building 26, however, she grabbed and shoveled. Inappropriate eating behaviors are not\ninterrupted by the staff. Without coordination on the ward, the school program is practically meaningless.\nThere is only one family style eating program at the Center. It involves seventeen clients in Building 2. Only in a\nfew of the buildings do the clients eat off plates. Plates and silverware were first used in Building 30, which\nhouses high-functioning residents, only about a year ago. Most Center residents are fed from compartmentalized\ntrays in which the various foods are often mixed.\nd. Speech Therapy\nThere are insufficient speech therapy programs at the Center. Neither Robert nor Janet Stutz has ever had any\nspeech therapy. Janet screams, though she is not verbal. Robert has also tried unsuccessfully to communicate.\nThough Robert is ambulatory, and \"can walk perfectly by himself,\" he spends much of his time sitting, locked into\na chair, with a restraining lapboard, in the dayroom of Building 14, Ward 3. As his parent testified:\nQ Is there any reason that you know of why Robert ought to be locked into a chair?\nA None.... Robert is not verbal but at one time in another ward he picked up his entire chair and\nput it on his back and proceeded to walk with it on his back. He was trying to tell the staff there I\nwant to get out of his chair but who listened. When I walked in a couple of days later they said to\nme the first thing 00 \"You know what you son did?\" \"No, what?\" \"He picked up the chair and walked\n97\naround with it on his back.\"\nI said, \"Well, he is trying to give you a message, that he wanted to get out of that chair.\"\nBarbara Karp, a resident since 1969, has never received any speech therapy. When her mother specifically\nrequested it for her, she was told \"there were very few therapists.\"\n\nBecause of the environment and lack of training, speech skills formerly acquired are lost. Tommy Czerniewicz,\n1324 who was able to talk and sing before he was institutionalized, now \"is virtually mute,\" in the words *1324 of his\nfather. In the thirteen years that Tommy has lived at the Center he received no training of any sort until two weeks\nbefore his father testified at the trial.\nWhen Dennis Silverman was admitted to the Center he could speak. Nevertheless he was placed in a ward in\nBuilding 15 with non-verbal residents. His speech ability declined markedly during the six or seven years he lived\nthere. His mother testified that the doctor in that ward did not even know Dennis could speak.\nHe was in an area where nobody spoke or said anything and had no reason to talk.\nOne day I came into Building 15 and I greeted all the men and I said good morning boys and my\nchild came forward and I said good morning Dennis and he said good morning mommy.\nAnd a doctor said to me, Mrs. Silverman, I didn't know he knew how to speak.\nAnd I said, Doctor, if you said good morning or good night you might know who could speak in this\nward.\nDonald Fearing who can speak single words, had speech therapy for an hour once or twice a week 00 not\n97\nenough, according to his father, to lead to any improvement in his speech. That his speech has now improved is\ndue to Donald's work with a private tutor, paid for out of his social security money, and arranged for by his father.\nMr. Fearing believes that Donald's behavior problems are due to \"his inability to express himself adequately.\"\nWith sufficient speech therapy or training in communication skills, this father believes many of his son's problems\nwould be alleviated.\nThomas Amorillo, the Chief of Speech and Hearing at the Center, conceded that while 600 clients are presently in\nspeech therapy, not all of those who require this work are receiving it. Amorillo acknowledged that a lack of\ncommunication skills may make a client appear to be less capable than he or she really is. The result is reduced\nexpectations and less attention to the client.\nThe absence of work on speech of clients is undoubtedly due in part to the lack of therapists at the Center. From\n1976 to 1979 when Mr. Amorillo was a staff speech therapist in Building 23, there were generally two speech\ntherapists for about 98 clients. As the Chief, Mr. Amorillo now supervises 28 speech pathologists for a client\npopulation of 1,200 00 not a significantly different ratio. At the time he testified Amorillo acknowledged there were\n97\ntwo vacancies for speech pathologists at the Center, for which he was trying to obtain an exemption from the\nhiring freeze.\nThe lack of enough clinically trained staff adversely affects the clients, who are denied the therapy and evaluation\nthey require. It also has a negative impact on the direct care staff, who \"are primarily responsible for the\nimplementation\" of speech programs; they are denied the training they need.\ne. Physical Therapy\nPhysical therapy programs are inadequate. Edward Jennings recalled that in 1978 very few residents were\nreceiving required positioning, necessary to the maintenance of body flexibility for those with severe muscular\nproblems. Generally, without such positioning or other physical therapy, muscle problems become worse. As\nexpert Brian Lensink put it:\nWell, if you have a physical disability and you are sat on a mat, hopefully on a mat, many other\ntimes on the floor of a cottage with 30 other people who have the same disabilities with one or two\nstaff persons, with no orientation to training, ... there is no way to exercise and to stimulate those\nlimbs in order to prevent the atrophy and the contractures which will become more and more\nsevere the older that person gets.... [I]f you take that same child and you start moving those limbs\nevery single day on a regular routine basis, and you start moving the joints and you start getting\n\nthat person to start standing up and straighten their spine and using the limbs ... you don't need to\n1325 have those kinds of *1325 crippling disabilities that occur from neglect.\nNow, once a person has already established that severe handicap it becomes exceedingly difficult\nto try to correct it. They can be improved over a period of time, but it is very unlikely that it will be\ncorrected.\nBoth plaintiffs' and defendants' experts reported on the shortage of physical therapists. Hugh Sage, one of the\ndefendants' experts, specifically mentioned the \"critical deficiency\" of physical therapists. He noted that the\nphysical therapy treatment activities at the Center met neither minimal federal standards nor current professional\nstandards. Dr. Sage warned,\nthat the existence of those deficiencies, were they not to be corrected, would have the effect of\npreventing the development of more normal behavior.... I do concede that it probably would\nprevent the development of a good deal of human behavior which ... the standards required.\nKathleen Schwaninger also observed many clients in need of physical and occupational therapy; she attributed\nthe fact that they were not receiving treatment to the shortage of physical therapy staff. Joseph Ryan, the Deputy\nDirector of the Center, acknowledged the difficulty the Center has had in recruiting physical therapists. He cited\nthat problem as the explanation for the numerous deficiencies in physical therapy found by various survey teams.\nResponding to this deficiency, the Center drafted a policy memorandum, dated February 1982; it has not\nalleviated the situation.\nThe impact of the lack of physical therapy and physical therapists on some clients has been disastrous. For\nexample, Dennis Silverman who could walk before he was institutionalized had to have major surgery to release\none of his legs. Following the operation, his doctor ordered certain post-operative physical exercises to enable\nDennis to move his legs performed at the Center. That therapy was never provided and Dennis' legs remain\nparalyzed.\nLyn Rucker saw no physical therapists at all in her tour of the Center. She was told of a formerly ambulatory\nresident whose hip was not pinned properly following a fracture, and for whom neither corrective surgery nor\ntherapy was planned. She also mentioned Audrey Rothstein, a resident of Building 26, for whom orthopedic\nshoes had been prescribed to enable her to walk. However,\nThe indication from the staff, is that she did not have her orthopedic shoes on, for her mother had\npurchased the shoes for her at a cost of $300, and since she is not toilet trained, she did not have\nthe shoes on because otherwise she would get the shoes messy. She was barefoot.\nI asked, wasn't it the opinion of the physical therapist, that she be wearing shoes at all times. The\nindication was that she did not have a physical therapist. They did not know whether she should\nbe wearing them all the time or not....\nAnother client, Barbara S., who had been mistakenly identified as non-ambulatory, spent 13 years in a wheelchair\nat the Center without any therapeutic intervention, before she began to learn to walk again. As a result, she has\nsuffered \"significant muscular atrophy.\"\nSeveral parents testified to the deterioration in their children's ability to walk. Russell Cohen, Tommy Czerniewicz\nand Susan Feibusch, who were ambulatory, were placed for a time in non-ambulatory wards. For Tommy, this\n\"meant that he was indoors all of the time and had absolutely nothing to do. He was virtually a prisoner.\" Although\nLisa Gorelick\nwalked into Suffolk Developmental Center fifteen and a half years ago with straight legs, she now\nis walking on bent legs, unless she has on a pair of full-length braces which [her mother] never\nsees her wearing.\nRestraints which prevent walking reduce the need for supervision, and allow the small number of staff to be\n1326 spread more thinly. According to mental health therapy and Phyllis Killigrew, staff *1326 feel it is easier to have a\nchild in a wheel chair [than] running around, because they are going to hurt themselves, because the biggest\n\nthing in the institution [is] that the child should never get hurt, because they don't want to explain how it\nhappened.\nf. Education\n(1) Prevocational and Workshop\nVocational habilitation consists of training clients, by stages, to perform work requiring simple skills. During its\nvisits, the Court was struck by the marked improvement of the Center's vocational program between the time of\nthe Court's first visit in November 1978 and in its later visits in February 1983. At trial, however, several experts\nemphasized continuing substantial deficiencies in the vocational programs.\nSome problems are attributable to conditions at the Center. Many, it seems, result from a lack of client workshop\nfacilities in the Long Island community.\nAs described by staff members and visiting experts and as seen by the Court in its later visits to the Center, the\nvocational program is divided into phases of increasing ability levels. A multi-handicapped client may begin with\npre-vocational skill training taught in Buildings 4 and 9. This consists of socialization, body awareness, color\ndiscrimination, and various tabletop learning games. Clients who have attained simple skills in packaging\nmaterials are placed in an upper pre-vocational program, such as that conducted in Building 20.\nMore advanced clients are placed in workshop programs in Building 17 and various satellite workshops around\nthe campus. In these workshops the clients perform assembly and packaging of materials under contracts with\nprivate industry. The tasks require from one to six simple and repetitive operations. For example, one contract\nconsisted of putting face sheets on the cover of notebook binders and then boxing the binders for shipment.\nAnother contract had clients assembling ball point pens for a hotel chain. Clients doing this kind of relatively\nadvanced work earn token piece-work wages.\nThe goal of the workshop program at the Center is to train clients for placement in community workshops.\nCommunity workshops are operated by private not-for-profit organizations and perform contract work for private\nindustry. The community workshops are subsidized both by the contract work and by the state Office of Mental\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities. To a greater degree than the Center these outside workshops are\nproduction oriented. In these shops clients earn income according to their production output.\nExpert Brian Lensink on his visit to the Building 20 program in the summer of 1982 noted \"a terrible shortage of\nwork.... The clients were sitting at the table without any work waiting for something....\" At no time did the staff\nmember present leave his desk or otherwise interact with the clients. Lensink was therefore skeptical when staff\nmembers told him that they had little time to teach work skills because of the pressure to get work out.\nLaura Knapp, an impressively articulate young woman with cerebral palsy who lives at the Center, testified that\nher program began only two weeks prior to her testimony and consisted of three hours a day, though \"on and off,\"\nof placing nuts and bolts in plastic bags. For someone like Ms. Knapp, who plainly should be living in the\ncommunity, such a program is unquestionably insufficient and fails to develop her potential.\nA serious continuing problem is the lack of community workshops and the restrictive eligibility criteria of those that\ndo exist. The paucity of workshops in the community forces Center residents to remain in the Center. Some\nclients residing in the community must return to the Center workshops for their day programs, an undesirable\nsituation. The back-up extends down the line to the prevocational programs, where the clients who are ready to\nmove on to the workshops must remain due to the lack of openings. The result is that at every level there are\n1327 some clients engaged *1327 in inappropriate vocational activity in inapposite settings.\nThe lack of community facilities has been attributed in part to the opposition of Nassau and Suffolk county\nofficials. Commissioner Slezak testified that these officials refused to give approval to various workshop and\nresidential proposals made by voluntary agencies, pursuant to state regulatory procedures. See 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §§\n51, 53. The director of the Young Adult Institute, a private agency with extensive experience in serving New York\n\nCity clients with severe handicaps and behavior problems, testified to the opposition of defendants and other\ncommunity agencies in Nassau when his organization attempted to establish day and residential programs on\nLong Island.\nA problem with the existing community workshops is apparently that, with their orientation towards production,\nthey will not accept clients who may need major training in order to work or who may exhibit inappropriate\nbehavior. By contrast the Center workshops are able to provide some training and deal with behavioral problems\nand still get some work out. Expert Kathleen Schwaninger criticized the private agencies and the state office that\nfunds them for not having the community workshops assume more responsibility for education and training. The\ncourt is not in a position to evaluate these criticisms since the focus of the suit was the Center. Much good work\nis done in community workshops and other institutions operated by private agencies.\nThe vocational program as it is currently conducted at the Center is a positive and hopeful sign, indicative of the\nimprovements that can be implemented at the Center with a dedicated leadership and staff. It also demonstrates\nhow some of the problems in developing community resources may possibly be traced to parochial attitudes and\neconomic and social circumstances in the Long Island community as a whole, not just to the deficiencies at the\nCenter.\n(2) School\nBuilding 9 houses an on-grounds school program, with 18 classrooms, that serves about 165 clients 00 most of\n97\nwhom are over age 21, and therefore no longer eligible for the local public school county-wide program. The\nbuilding is divided into two wings, with a gymnasium in the center. The clients are grouped by functioning level,\nso that, in Kathleen Schwaninger's words,\nOne wing houses classrooms for lower functioning clients with emphasis on social skills, training,\neating, developing eating skills, developing personal care skills, learning how to dress, comb the\nhair, wash their hands, go to the bathroom, brush their teeth.\nWing B individuals [are a] higher-functioning group of clients, including three vocational and\nprevocational clients.\nA similar program in Building 21 serves 110 clients.\nOne hundred thirty five Center residents, all under age 21, attend public school programs. 35 Center residents\nattend community day programs operated by United Cerebral Palsy and the Association for the Help of Retarded\nChildren.\nBuilding 4 opened as a program building on September 15, 1982 00 while this trial was in progress. It serves\n97\nprimarily profoundly retarded, multiply handicapped individuals. The program there, as described by Rosalind\nBurke, Deputy Director of Treatment Services at the Center,\nvaries with the different groups. From my multi-handicapped group, who are non-ambulatory, we\nwould [do] primarily prevocational skilled training. We do socialization, body awareness, color\ndiscrimination. We are also incorporating into this program, this task for these clients. Some of\nthem ... are not transported, they go by themselves with a staff member with them to the building\nfour program. This means crossing the road.\nSo what we have been trying to do and we are in the process of establishing goals for training so\n1328 they will learn to look both ways when crossing the road, watch *1328 out for traffic. We are\nworking on a signal being placed in that area so they can be aware of stop signs, etc.\nDespite the defendants' belief that all residents ought to leave their residential buildings for programming\nbecause \"a change in environment is good for everybody,\" more than 300 clients, particularly those in\nwheelchairs, continue to receive their training, if any, in the same buildings in which they live. The experts\ntestified that the educational programs do not accommodate all of the residents who should attend them. Some of\n\nthe classrooms, particularly those for clients with orthopedic equipment, in the medical-surgical building, are\nneither large enough nor adequately equipped with appropriate teaching materials to effectively accomplish the\nteaching intended. Kathleen Schwaninger reported only short teaching schedules in inadequately furnished\nclassrooms:\nThere is not room in those classrooms for the respective teachers to be able to take the clients out\nof their orthopedic equipment and work with them in a motor-development kind of way.\nIt is crowded .... [I]n each classroom the way the clients were being worked with was by the\nteacher placing a different kind of toy or material in front of the clients and then rotating from client\nto client and working with 00 in working with that particular toy.\n97\nA second classroom had been set up within the three weeks previous to my visit.\nThat classroom was barren. It was bare. The teacher really didn't have an adequate supply of\nmaterials at all.\nThe teacher didn't have a desk.... It is a very limited period of time. It is only approximately an\nhour. There are not enough materials.\nThe teachers are really to be commended for their commitment. They really want to work with the\nclients and do something for them.\nBut, ... the teacher, himself, responds to a barren environment.... And the clients are not provided\nwith stimulation.\nNeither the school program nor the workshops or prevocational programs provide the full six hour complement of\nprogramming, accepted as standard by professionals in the mental retardation field. Yet Brian Lensink pointed\nout that eight hours is the accepted standard for workshop programs.\nBrian Lensink testified that Richie, one of the workshop participants in Building 9, could have received at best a\nmaximum program day of \"five hours and that was not every day.\" In Building 9, the program day ends at two\no'clock, though it is scheduled to end at three o'clock. Ms. Schwaninger testified that other clients in Building 10\ncould be receiving no more than 2-3½ hours of schooling.\nPrograms do not operate over the summer. This, said Kathleen Schwaninger, results in clients losing \"skills they\npossess when school lets out in May, ... [so] when the students come back in the fall, there is a significant period\nof time spent in recapping what the clients had when they left the classroom program.\" The summer hiatus is\napparently due, at least in part, to a bureaucratic entanglement which would require teachers 00 who work only\n97\nduring the school year 00 in the educational program to be reclassified as Developmental Disability Specialists in\n97\norder to work during the summer.\ng. Deaf and Blind Clients\nThe Center has no special programs for deaf and blind clients. Staff members testified that they are badly\nneeded.\n3. Individual Developmental Plans\nCenter policy as well as federal and state law requires that a written individualized treatment plan setting forth\ndetermined goals, with specific programs and therapies to achieve those goals, be developed and maintained,\nwith current records of progress, for each client. An adequately detailed and up-to-date developmental plan is\n1329 crucial. It is the means by which staff learn what programs have been specifically *1329 designed for each client,\nand how those programs are to be implemented.\n\nIn the prior discussions of \"staffing\" and \"programming,\" failures were traced in part to lack of programs, lack of\nstaff familiarity with what programs did exist, and inadequate staff training in the implementation of programs.\nAdditionally, the inadequate programming at the Center may be attributed to the deficient condition of many\nindividual plans. Of the 32 plans that Brian Lensink randomly examined during his visit to the Center, none\nreflected the client's specific or important needs. For example, in September 1982, Mr. Lensink reviewed Russell\nCohen's plan and found a goal that stated \"Russell will not imbibe any unusual liquids from 6/4/82 to 12/4/82.\"\nWhen he mentioned it to the staff, no one knew of any unusual liquids Russell was imbibing. In many of the\nplans, the goals had not been adequately documented, and were out of date.\nOften, the goals were broadly stated and poorly described, so that they were of no use to the direct care staff\ncharged with carrying them out. Lensink found percentage goals, though the staff had no means of measuring\nthem. The same goals, on xeroxed forms, were used for many clients even when this uniformity appeared to be\ninappropriate. In Lensink's view, identical plans did not \"appear to be the best way to establish individualized\ngoals.\"\nMany of the individual treatment plans at the Center are useless. In the case of Richie S., for instance, Brian\nLensink found that\nThere really was no program in the [Individual Developmental Plan]. There was lots of papers but\nno specific program to be worked on. There was no program information available to the [Direct\nCare Staff person] to follow.\nThough Richie's school teacher had written goals for him they \"were kept in a file cabinet in the school and they\nwere not going to the residence and they were not in the plan.\" The plans are often descriptive of staff activity\nrather than client achievement. For example, a typical statement is: \"will receive individual care with respect to\nbathing, feeding, dressing, to maximize health and comfort,\" with no indication of how these general goals were\nto be accomplished. Even the widely used \"canned\" plans introduced at trial by defendants contained goals that\nwere vague, non-behavioral, unmeasurable, and stated in a negative manner 00 all contrary to the Center's own\n97\ntraining manual.\nVery few individual development plans, moreover, set forth step-by-step procedures for the staff to follow; they\nare written so broadly and generally that the staff cannot tell what to do. The result is an enormous amount of\npaper, but not a specific program for the client focused on his or her most important needs. Thus, defendants'\nambitious goal plan for correction of one client's \"pica\" behavior turned out to be nothing but a goal 00 the\n97\nnecessary baseline information had never been compiled because of a lack of staff. There were no instructions to\nthe staff as to when various activities should occur, and in fact, the plan had never been implemented.\nFederally mandated independent peer reviews of the Center, including that of May 1982, have consistently\ncriticized the institution's deficiencies in program evaluation, documentation, and record-keeping. The most\nrecent survey found that half of the psychological evaluations of Building 28 residents had not been updated.\nBoth the State's own expert, Dr. Hugh Sage, and Joseph Ryan, the Deputy Director of the Center, agreed that\nadequate documentation was lacking.\nThe most serious problem with the Center's developmental plans is that almost nobody uses them for their\nintended purpose. As noted above, the plans are inaccessible to the staff who might make use of them. Almost\ninvariably, when plaintiffs' experts asked employees about the plans for clients in their charge, the staff was\nunaware of the goals and methods they supposedly contained. As mental health therapy aid Margie Grant\n1330 explained, even those employees who are aware of the clients' goals are generally so busy with other duties that \n*1330 they have no time to work on them. The plans, however good or bad they are, are almost never\nimplemented or even understood by staff.\nThis widespread failure to make use of individual development plans is harmful to the clients. The experts agreed\nthat the resulting lack of consistent clues and responses from all staff confuses the clients and inhibits their\nlearning.\n\n4. Environmental Conditions\na. Wards\nThere are 25 residential buildings at the Center. Aside from the smaller cottages which house higher-functioning\nclients, they are generally divided into wards of 18 to 25 clients. Each has a dormitory or bedroom area, often\nkept locked during the day, a dayroom, and a dining area.\nIn order to comply with federal requirements, necessary to continued receipt of federal funds, some of the larger\ndayrooms have been subdivided to function as residential sleeping areas, as well as dayrooms. Partial dividers\nhave been used to separate the dayroom area from eight-bed groupings. This increases the square footage per\nclient bedroom space, and conforms to the eight-bed federal limitation on residential groupings of clients.\nWhen Fred McCormack assumed the post of Director in August 1981, he closed three buildings that had been\nresidences because they were not suitable 00 the last in May, 1982.\n97\nOver and over, the same words appear in the trial record to describe the environment in which residents must\nlive: barren, unstimulating, empty, prison-like, and harmful. These observations were made by experts, parents,\nand some of Center's own direct-care staff about every residential building throughout 1982, and earlier.\nResidents spend many hours in large dayrooms with few furnishings, toys, personal belongings or decorations.\nThey wander, sit, rock or lie on hard uncarpeted terrazzo floors which magnify the din caused by constantly\nblaring television sets, radios, and record players, often all going at once.\nThe painfully high noise level frustrates any effort that might be made at communication. Toys and the like are\nrarely in evidence because of the overextended staff's fear that some residents would take them apart and\nperhaps try to eat them.\nThe dayrooms are usually sparsely furnished, with few, if any chairs. Furniture where available is usually\ninappropriate. For example, in its visit of February 21, 1983, the court observed metal furniture, with sharp edges,\nused to separate part of a dayroom in Building 11 that had been converted to a bedroom in order to meet federal\nrequirements.\nAlmost without exception, the doors are locked to buildings, to dayrooms within the buildings, to bathrooms, and\nto sleeping areas. Thus clients cannot go to the bathroom on their own, even if they are otherwise able to. They\ncannot relax on their own bed or escape from the tumult of the dayroom. There simply is not enough staff\navailable on the living units to supervise the clients in more than one place at a time.\nIn the bathrooms the toilets often lack partitions between them, as well as toilet paper, towels and soap. And in\nadult wards, the sinks are designed for use by children, so that the residents cannot be taught how to use them.\nIn the East Campus, there are no bathtubs in the residential buildings. Many clients are subjected to congregate\nor \"gang\" showers because of the shortage of staff.\nSeveral of defendants' witnesses, including Dr. Stanley Slawinsky, Deputy Director for Quality Assurance at the\nCenter, admitted that the situation is not satisfactory. Dr. Richard Blanton, one of defendants' experts commented\nthat, \"[a] lot of doors need to be unlocked, a lot of normalized things need to happen at Suffolk ...\" And Laurie\nSchwartz, a Speech Pathologist Supervisor at the Center, agreed that it is inappropriate for both the television set\nand record player to be on at the same time.\n1331 *1331 Other witnesses testifying for the defendants acknowledged the constant problems with vermin. There was\na serious rodent infestation noted by the survey team in its May 1982 inspection. Such problems continue today.\nSome units are not cooled in summer and the hot sun beating down on the unshaded brick buildings raises the\ntemperature to a dangerous level. By contrast, in the winter, the heat in some buildings is insufficient, creating\nspecial problems for poorly clothed clients sitting on the terrazzo floors.\n\nThe most recent independent survey of the Center contained 19 pages of life safety code violations and 58 pages\nof related environmental, maintenance, sanitation, safety, and programmatic violations. Included were such\nproblems as timely completion of only 18% of scheduled preventive maintenance. The facility's performance on\nthis review, conducted by the State Office of Health Systems Management, was a slight improvement over the 64\npages of deficiencies in October, 1981, and was considerably better than the 99 pages in the 1980 survey.\nPlaintiffs' witnesses concluded that physical conditions alone rendered the Center an unsafe environment for\nsome of its residents. Dr. Hugh Sage, one of the defendants' experts, testified that, while in his opinion \"overall\nSDC met minimum requirements,\" the \"substantial physical deficiencies\" kept the residences from meeting\ncertain federal standards, to the extent of preventing the clients' development of more normal behavior. He\ntestified that conditions at the Center have the potential to be detrimental. Sage noted that the Center has been\ndenied accreditation by several boards. While another of defendants' witnesses concluded that Center is safe, he\ndid note the risk of harm to which it exposed clients in wheelchairs.\nThe aspect of the Center's ward environment that was agreed upon by both plaintiffs' and defendants' witnesses\nwas the general idleness and lack of human interaction already referred to which permeates the dayroom areas.\nParents consistently testified that clients are herded together in groups of twenty or more, with two or three staff\nat a time who pay little attention to the residents. They are rarely allowed to go out of doors, even on weekends\nwhen the weather is good and there is nothing else to do. Particularly for those who remain in the wards all day,\nthe lack of the ability to go outside their locked buildings compounds the effect of the bleak and barren wards.\nb. Lack of Personal Belongings\nSeveral parents and relatives of clients, regular visitors to the Center, testified that they had never observed any\nclients' personal belongings, either with the client or in the client's private chest of drawers. Belongings, such as\nitems of clothing, which they brought to their children or relatives disappeared. In its tour of Building 28, the\nmorning of February 21, 1983, the court observed nothing in the identical chests of drawers assigned to many of\nthe clients.\n5. Inadequate Equipment\na. Adaptive Equipment\nAppropriately adapted and maintained equipment, particularly wheelchairs and orthopedic carts, is generally\nlacking at the Center. There has been a five-month delay in repairing broken wheelchairs. Some Suffolk residents\nspend their days, not in adapted wheelchairs, but in orthopedic carts 00 the use of which was condemned by\n97\ndefendants' own expert, Dr. Blanton, as preventing the clients from progressing appropriately and impeding their\nmovement into the community.\nSince the Center lacks sufficient vehicles to transport carts, the lack of adaptive wheelchairs prevents many\nresidents from leaving their wards. At least 284 non-ambulatory clients (in addition to those in Building 19 and the\nupper floors of Building 16) remain confined to their residential buildings for the entire day, primarily because of\ntransportation problems.\n1332  b. Motor Vehicles\n*1332\nSome of the buses and ambulances owned and operated by the Center, and used to transport the clients are not\nsafely equipped or properly maintained. Anthony Adams, a bus driver, told of being ordered to drive a bus which\nlacked working seat-belts to secure the residents' wheelchairs, and of an ambulance with emergency lights that\ndid not function for six months.\n\nWith maintenance problems left unattended for so long, the vehicles frequently break down. The result is that\nsome clients receive a short programming day because they arrive late.\nAn even greater risk of harm arises when breakdowns delay transportation to the emergency room of the\nhospital. At the public hearing of June 20, 1983 many parents of Suffolk residents expressed grave concern\nabout the insufficient number and condition of the ambulances.\nc. Adaptive Clothing\nAdaptive clothing is specifically constructed either for those whose physical handicaps require accommodation,\nor for those who require clothing modifications such as large buttonholes with oversize buttons, or a strip of\nvelcro in place of a zipper, so that they may dress themselves. Kathleen Schwaninger saw no such clothing at\nSuffolk. If there is adaptive clothing at the Center, there is not enough of it to meet the needs of clients who could\nprobably dress themselves, and more easily engage in other self-care tasks such as toileting were such clothing\nprovided.\nApart from special clothing problems, many residents are not provided with clean, adequate, and appropriate\nclothing. Sometimes, they are not fully clothed. There are few examples of properly dressed residents in the\nmany photographs submitted to the court. At the public hearing held June 20, 1983, one mother showed the court\na pair of shoes her son had been given; there were many sharp nails sticking far out in the insides of one shoe\nand the instep was missing. Dennis Silverman, who wears size 42 trousers, has been given clothing so tight, that\nit was necessary to cut it from him with a scissors. Unlike normal children and adults, many of the clients cannot\ncomplain. They must mutely suffer this pain and indignity.\nParents and relatives testified that they have spent substantial sums of their own money to buy clothing for the\nSuffolk residents, only to have it disappear. What clothing there is has not been stored in dressers or chests or\notherwise made accessible to the clients. There has been little opportunity for Center residents to learn to dress\nthemselves appropriately or to learn to choose their own apparel.\n6. General Problems in Institutional Environments\nHardly unique to the Center, but nevertheless affecting substantially the lives of some of the residents are\nenvironmental problems endemic to large, congregate-care institutions. Much of the testimony produced by both\nsides supported a professional consensus in favor of smaller facilities. Fred McCormack, the Director of the\nSuffolk Developmental Center, concurred.\nThe necessities of managing an institution which has more than a thousand clients and thousands of employees\npreclude many desirable changes. For example, plaintiffs' experts noted that when a few workers attempt to\nfollow and control twenty-four residents, the staff get so involved in simply running after the clients, that ordinary\ncommon communication and interaction with them may not occur. Even with improved staffing and programming,\nand a warmer, more personal physical environment, residents of the Center are likely to pick up each other's\nnegative behavior.\nThe chaos of this institutional environment makes any growth difficult, inhibits the learning process of the\nmentally retarded, and provides them with little opportunity to meet \"normal\" persons, or develop close\nrelationships with them. Where friendships do take root, as between resident Laura Knapp and a staff worker,\n1333 they are inhibited by institutional policies such *1333 as that at the Center which prohibits clients from visiting the\nhomes of staff.\nCentralization of certain tasks such as cooking and laundering, necessary to the effective operation of a large\nfacility, precludes the clients' opportunities to learn the rudiments of cooking and laundering. Supplies such as\ntoilet paper, soap, linens and toothpaste are often hard to obtain because they are centrally located and kept\nlocked up.\n\nBrian Lensink summed up the matter by stating that living in a large institution\n... takes away an awful lot of the natural training environment that would be available to people if\nthey were in smaller settings. It is rather overwhelming to deal with your laundry in large\ncommercial type laundry facilities or when there are thirty clients' clothing all sitting there ready to\nbe washed. If you can go into the laundry room or the laundromat with only six residents from a\ngroup home you have an environment in which to train a person. That environment is not readily\navailable on one of the wards.\nIt is even more particular with food preparation. All the food preparation is done centrally, brought\nin in carts. You really have no opportunity to learn how to use any kind of kitchen equipment, how\nto even return your plates properly to the kitchen after you have eaten. You take away their whole\ntraining environment which is necessary for a person to live in a community. There are numerable\ntraining environments like that, mowing the lawn, maintaining the yard. Those are not only things\nthat are important to teach a person so they can live in a community, it is also an activity to occupy\ntime in a productive way rather than wandering or occupying a ward, if you could go out and mow\nthe lawn, rake the leaves, shovel the sidewalk, trim the lawn, if you can do those kinds of activities\nin your home you then occupy your hours with meaningfulness rather than with nothingness. And\nso you both have a better life in my opinion as well as a better training ground for those people\nwho are learning to do those activities.\nThe restrictive rules of the Center, required by the huge number of people living there, make it impossible for the\nresidents ever to acquire the skills necessary for success in a less restrictive environment. According to Kathleen\nSchwaninger:\n... to maintain control over a population that size, over a campus that large, over 900 clients, 1300\nclients, to try to meet your obligation to keep people safe, what ends up happening is that people\ncan't be kept safe, first of all, but secondly, restrictions are imposed.\nNo state, including New York, builds large institutions for its mentally retarded citizens any longer. Other states\nare depopulating their large institutions. See Bogin, Group Homes for Persons with Handicaps: Recent\nDevelopments in the Law, 5 W. New Eng.L.Rev. 423, 424 (1983). All experts agree that small, community-based\nresidences are better for the client and perhaps cheaper and more efficient for the state. This issue is discussed\nmore fully below under Reduction of Population.\n7. Lack of an Internal Monitoring System\nLess than two months before the trial in this case, an internal monitoring system was finally implemented at the\nCenter. Until that time, there had been no internal monitoring so that many of the problems already discussed 00\n97\nparticularly regarding client care and environmental factors 00 were exacerbated. For example, the Incident\n97\nReview Committee investigates specific instances of client abuse, injury and death, and makes recommendations\nabout them. Until September 1, 1982, there was no specific procedure to follow-up the cases, to determine if\nrecommendations had been carried out. The result, acknowledged by the Deputy Director for quality assurance\nat the Center as \"an ongoing problem,\" was that the Incident Review Committee had to make the same\nrecommendations over and over again.\n1334  8. Funding\n*1334\nFunds for the Center are obtained from a number of sources, all of which are channeled through the state. The\nprocess calls for the Director of the developmental center to submit a budget request to the state Office of Mental\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities in Albany, which in turn uses the information to prepare its own\nbudget request. That budget is submitted through the Governor to the legislature. The legislature then makes its\nappropriations on the basis of specific requests. There are limitations on the use of monies so that, for example,\n\nfunds appropriated for physical renovations to bring the Center into compliance with federal standards may not\nbe used to develop community resources for the mentally retarded on Long Island.\nCompliance with federal safety and treatment standards is particularly important because the federal government\nthrough the Medicaid program pays fifty percent of the cost per client of those who reside in developmental\ncenters which are certified as meeting federal standards. Federal reimbursement is made to the state, rather than\nto the individual institution, on the basis of a statewide average rate. In New York in 1982 the federal\nreimbursement rate per client was over $140 per day, or more than $40,000 a year. Since the per capita\nexpenditure at the Center for fiscal 1981-82 was $32,100, it appears that the state expends virtually none of its\nown funds for client care there and that, in fact, some of the federal monies generated by Center residents are\nused for the benefit of individuals in other institutions. At Willowbrook, the Staten Island Developmental Center,\nfor example, $48,400 was spent per client in fiscal 1981-82. In 1982-83, the per capita cost at the Suffolk Center\nwas anticipated at $34,700 while at Willowbrook, the Staten Island Developmental Center, it was estimated at\n$60,800.\nOther federal Medicaid funds are available under what is known as the Title 19 waiver provision for family care\nplacements, which can include maintaining the mentally retarded person in his or her own home. See 42 U.S.C. §\n1396n(c) (Supp. 1983). The Title 19 waiver also provides for a fifty percent federal reimbursement of funds, and\nmay be used to fund case management, rehabilitation, respite, personal care, and homemaker services. New\nYork State, however, does not participate in the waiver program. State appropriations for community placements\nand services for the mentally retarded have been cut back.\n9. Reduction of Population\nThe defendants are aware of professional skepticism regarding the effectiveness of treatment at large\ninstitutions. Both plaintiffs' and defendants' experts supported community programming for virtually all retarded\nindividuals. Direct testimony on this point was given by Edward Jennings, a professional with vast experience in\nthe New York State system:\nTHE COURT: [G]iven adequate functioning of [personnel,] management, physical facilities and the\nlike, can you set up an institution for 900 people in Suffolk on these premises that can do a decent\njob for people in the institution?\nTHE WITNESS: I don't believe that there is any historical record at all that that kind of resource, a\nfacility of that kind, can be managed properly.\nYou know, again, I don't believe that we have a record of where a facility of that size, given all that\nit needs, can be operated successfully.\nTHE COURT: I take it, then, to sum up your view, you think that the probabilities of a more\neffective treatment are greater in the community-based facility than in a large institution of even\n900 beds?\nTHE WITNESS: Without question.\nOf primary importance is the fact that most mentally retarded people cannot generalize sufficiently well to learn in\nan institutional setting the skills they need to enjoy a more normal and less restrictive existence. According to Ms.\nSchwaninger:\n... Part of the symptomatology of mental retardation is that the mentally retarded person, in his\n1335 brain, doesn't have *1335 the same kind of skills that we have, symbolically in our brains.\nSo it is not easy for a mentally retarded person to see a fake stop sign, walk out onto a real street,\nsee a real stop sign, and realize that that's just like the fake one that the teacher was talking to me\nabout.\n\nPart of the symptomology is incapacity when it comes to symbolization and generalization and\ntransference from an artificial learning experience to a real experience.\nA small setting is also beneficial to retarded individuals because they have difficulty in integrating and\ndiscriminating among a large number of impressions or sensations. When there are large numbers of other\nclients and staff moving in and out of the picture, a retarded person may withdraw from the confusion and turn\ninward. The effects of size explain in part the higher staff morale and retention rates often seen in small\ncommunity programs.\nCommunity placement of mentally retarded individuals is further supported by the principle of normalization, a\ntheory particularly attributed to N.E. Bank-Mikkelson in Denmark in 1959, Bengt Nirje in Denmark in 1969, and\nWolf Wolfensberger in the United States in 1972. It is now accepted around the world and imparted to all\nappropriate state employees as part of their training. The essence of normalization is the integration of retarded\npeople into society at large by ending their segregation and isolation in large-scale institutions.\nAccording to the State training manual, normalization means, among other things,\n[l]iving in a normal neighborhood[,] not in a large facility with 20, 50, or 100 other people because\nyou are retarded, and not isolated from the rest of the community. Normal locations and normal\nsize homes will give residents better opportunities for successful integration with their\ncommunities.\nDefendants generally share the plaintiffs' view that for the majority of Center residents, placement in some form\nof a small community based living situation would be more appropriate. Commissioner Slezak testified that New\nYork is committed to \"moving towards the community based system of care, and to reducing the populations at its\ninstitutional facilities.\" Judy Walker, the Director of Nursing at the Center said simply, \"I don't think any client\nbelongs at the Suffolk Developmental Center. If ... I could do anything to keep any client from having to be\nplaced, I would be the first one to do it.\"\nPerhaps the testimony of Fred McCormack, the Director of the Center, was most telling on this point:\n\"We all want the same thing. We ... would want to place as many possible people as we can. And\nwe're trying like heck to do it. And it takes the Legislature and the State of New York to find the\nresources to do it.\"\nMr. McCormack also noted that often those placed in the community function at a much higher level than at the\nCenter.\nThis point is dramatically illustrated by the testimony of Philip Feibusch. His daughter, Susan, spent eleven years\nat the Center before moving to a group home in Greenport, Long Island. The contrast between the Center where\nstaffing problems and anonymity create difficulties in training and the small community residence is striking.\nBut the change that has come over Susan, it's like night and day. In six weeks there was a big\nchange. She does things there that I never thought were ... possible. I didn't think that Susan\ncould make her bed.... She was learning how to dress herself.... And she places her clothes and\neverything away. She takes her own showers. She washes her own hair.... She is living like a\nhuman being. She even makes her own sandwich and helps with the cooking....\nQ What about toilet accidents, does she have those any longer?\nA Not in the house any more, no. She knows where to go....\n1336 Q Did Susan ever have an opportunity to practice those skills that she may have *1336 learned in\nthe day program at AHRC while she was living in the Suffolk County Developmental Center?\nA .... No....\n\nThe population at the Center has not been reduced to the extent all agree it should be. Community residential\nplacements, day programs, and necessary clinical and support services have not been provided in numbers\nsufficient to meet the needs of those currently at the Center. Nor has adequate aid been given to those mentally\nretarded persons in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and their families who are not in state custody, but are often\nwithout adequate resources.\nUnder the original five-year plan devised by New York State to comply with federal Medicaid requirements, the\nCenter's population was to have been reduced to 907 by March, 1982. Yet, on October 21, 1982, the day the trial\nin this case ended, the Center cared for more than 1,200 clients 00 300 more than it should have had.\n97\nNot only have the defendants failed to comply with their own five-year plan, they have developed no new plan to\nreplace it. Though Deputy Commissioner Robert Norris mentioned a plan to bring the Center's population to 900\nby March 31, 1984, he acknowledged that no written document exists reflecting this goal. There is no plan to\nreduce the population below 900.\nThe testimony of Dr. George E. Smith, Director of the Office of Community Services for the Long Island\nDevelopmental Disabilities Services Office, revealed that there was no program to place Center residents in the\ncommunity, other than studies of projected need. Though he too testified that there was no specific written plan\nfor reducing the Center's population, on the last day of trial, Director Fred McCormack produced a table showing\nprojections reducing the population to 1070 by April, 1984; and to 810 by April, 1987. Those figures were\nsupported by no documents, explaining where and how those placements out of the Center would be\naccomplished.\nAt the hearings in June on the Director's plan to comply with the court's interim order, a schedule of projected\nnew community centers was revealed for the first time. It reads as follows:\n    PROJECTED SUFFOLK DEVELOPMENTAL\n           CENTER PLACEMENTS\n    -------------------------------\n  Fiscal Year 83/84 (Based on actual\n         census 1,194, 4/1/83)\n  ----------------------------------\n                 No. of            No. of\nLocation       SDC Clients    Community Clients\nLattingtown        10                0\nEast Northport     12                0\nGarden City Park    8                0\nUpper Brookville    4                4\nEastport            7                0\nFarmingdale        10                0\nWesthampton         8                0\nPlainview           9                0\nWading River A      8                2\nWading River B      8                2\nRiverhead           4                4\nSetauket            1                0\nMelville            1                0\nFamily Care        27                0\n                  ___                __\n   Total          117                12\n       Fiscal Year 84/85 (Based on projected\n\n               census 1,077, 4/1/84)\n       -------------------------------------\n                 No. of            No. of\nLocation       SDC Clients    Community Clients\nBayville           0                 48\nWantagh            4                  4\nWoodbury           5                  5\nCoram              8                  4\nSmithtown          5                  4\nCommack A          4                  4\nCommack B         14                 14\nRockville Center   5                  5\nDix Hills          4                  4\nOakdale            4                  4\nFamily Care       24                  0\n                  __                 __\n   Total          77                 96\n         Projected Census 1,000, 4/1/85\n         ------------------------------\nThe following is a listing of potential sites presently\nunder review that may yield additional placements\nduring FY 84/85:\nHolbrook       8      North Bellmore   8\nYaphank        8      Syosset          8 to 10\nMedford       10      Wantagh          8 to 10\nMiddle Island 48\n  (5 acres)\nThese projections are probably the most that can realistically be expected. Dr. Smith, who is responsible for the\ndevelopment of community resources for the retarded in Long Island, testified that he could not plan to develop\ncommunity sites beyond 1983 because of lack of money:\n1337 *1337 [W]e have experienced cut-backs in that funding. The result is that at present we have no\nacquisition money for the purchase of new property, and that the first instance money, that is the\nmoney that would go to start up or renovations of 00 of houses that we could purchase has been\n97\ndrastically reduced. Therefore, ... we don't really know what the picture looks like. And it's very,\nvery difficult for us to make any kind of firm plans beyond next year.\nPlanning is requisite both to guide the placement effort, and to secure adequate funding from the legislature and\ncooperation from local private and public agencies and private citizens. What is called for is a comprehensive\nlong-term plan which includes an assessment (in the aggregate) of individual client needs, a description of the\nprograms and services required to meet those needs, an inventory of available programs and services and a\ncatalogue of those that must be developed, a description of the administrative measures and procedures that\nmust be followed in order to develop the needed programs and services and a specification of responsibilities for\ncarrying out such measures and procedures, an analysis of potential obstacles and their possible solutions, a\nstatement of the means by which required programs and services will be funded, and a timetable indicating when\nall necessary events are scheduled to occur. No single one of the defendants' plans, or even all of them, taken\ntogether, contained all of the necessary elements.\n\nB. Lack of Adequate Services and Programs in the Community\nThe state is doing relatively little to encourage the development of small-scale settings and to provide the\nnecessary home and community support facilities.\n1. The Retarded at Home\nThe overwhelming majority of the approximately 18,000 mentally retarded and developmentally disabled in\nNassau and Suffolk Counties live at home. The Long Island agency of the state Developmental Disabilities\nServices Office whose responsibilities include coordination of all services to this constituency is housed at the\nSuffolk Developmental Center. Retarded citizens living at home are not members of the certified class.\nNevertheless, some appreciation of their problems is necessary for an assessment of realistic remedies for the\ncertified class in this case.\nAt the trial, parents who have chosen to keep their severely handicapped children at home testified to the lack of\navailable local community residences and day programs and the extraordinary strains placed on the other\nmembers of the family by keeping the child at home. One father asserted, however, that he would rather see his\nson dead than at the Center. Others, parents and relatives of current Center residents testified that they felt\ncompelled to institutionalize their children or siblings because no community services or programs were available\nthat would permit them to remain at home.\nAs noted above, the professional consensus endorsed by the defendants is that residence in the community is\nthe most effective, appropriate form of treatment for most mentally retarded individuals, including those with\nsevere psychological and physiological disorders. It would be expected then that the defendants would support\nall efforts to maintain those already living in the community, in their homes 00 the most \"normal\" situation of all 00\n97 97\nby making available the necessary doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, case workers, social workers, physical\ntherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and respite and homemaker services for the families. As\nBrian Lensink pointed out, many families do not need to place their retarded children outside the home if they are\nprovided appropriate support.\nNevertheless, the state provides almost no funds to maintain clients in their own homes. It has not, as pointed out\nabove, applied for federal funds to do so under the Title 19 waiver provision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), which\n1338 provides funding for a wide variety of habilitation services for *1338 mentally retarded individuals in any type of\ncommunity setting, including their own homes, with 50% federal reimbursement.\n2. Existing Community Residential Alternatives\nCommunity residences are operated by the state and by private not-for-profit voluntary agencies, with whom the\nstate contracts. In Long Island, the state provides four types of community residential alternatives00supportive\n97\nliving arrangements, family care placements, community residences, and intermediate care facilities.\nSupportive living arrangements are for generally high functioning individuals who can live independently in an\napartment with little supervision. Currently, there are 59 clients in Nassau and Suffolk counties in supportive living\narrangements.\nIn a family care situation, a family, called a provider, takes a mentally retarded or developmentally disabled\nindividual into its home to live as a family member. The providers are given a 16-hour training session, after\nwhich they are licensed by the state. There are 212 clients in Long Island in family care. In 1982, only 15 family\ncare placements were made in Long Island.\nIn explaining the low number of Long Island family care placements, Dr. Smith mentioned that his office had\nencountered recruitment problems in locating family care providers. There may be other explanations as well. For\nexample, New York has no system of variable rates for family care providers, so that those providing for more\n\nhandicapped individuals receive the same rate, about $300 per client per month, as those providing for the less\nhandicapped, though the former may well require more time and attention. The rate for family care in Arizona, by\ncontrast, ranges from $200 to $900 per month. Defendants' expert, Dr. Blanton, uses a variable rate structure in\nIllinois and would recommend it for New York as well.\nDefendants acknowledge that it is harder to place the more handicapped clients in the community. New York's\nuse of a flat rate may therefore account in part for the low number of family care placements in Long Island.\nPersonal care providers give services to more handicapped clients, who have both medical and behavioral\nproblems. They function much like family care providers, but receive additional training and a supplementary\nreimbursement. There are no personal care placements on Long Island.\nA community residence is generally a single family dwelling with 4 to 14 clients. Although clients are supervised,\neither by live-in house parents, or by rotating shifts of staff, clients usually prepare their own meals, keep their\nown belongings and go out together to shop for food and clothing.\nThere are 177 clients from Nassau and 135 from Suffolk in community residences. By contrast, in Westchester\nCounty, which is roughly comparable to Nassau in size, population and socioeconomic factors, there are 606\nretarded individuals living in community residences. N.Y. Times, June 26, 1983, § 11 (Westchester Weekly), at 4,\ncol. 3.\nAll community residences on Long Island are run by private, voluntary agencies. None are presently operated by\nthe state. The residences house only ambulatory clients, even though nonambulatory clients who can maneuver\ntheir own wheelchairs could be accommodated in a community residence setting.\nA fourth type of community setting found on Long Island is the intermediate care facility. This is similar to a\ncommunity residence, but provides greater supervision for those clients with more substantial medical and\nbehavioral needs. There are 333 clients in intermediate care facilities on Long Island. Seven such facilities are\noperated by the state. Others are operated by private agencies. The state also runs several free-standing\nintermediate care facilities that adjoin the Suffolk Developmental Center.\nAll residents of the state-run intermediate care facilities have come from the Center. Clients housed in the state\n1339 facilities are those with the more serious problems *1339 because the private agencies are hesitant to assume\nthe care of clients with severe behavioral problems.\nAs the experience with community residences and intermediate care facilities indicates, the voluntary agencies\nthat now operate residence programs on Long Island do not, with the possible exception of the United Cerebral\nPalsy Association, serve clients who are severely or profoundly retarded and wheelchairbound, or difficult to\nmanage behaviorally. There was testimony that non-Nassau-Suffolk voluntary agencies wishing to open\nresidences and operate programs that would service the more handicapped clients were not welcomed.\nTo sum up, a total of 916 Nassau-Suffolk County clients have been placed in some community residential\nalternative as follows:\n  Placements             Alternative\n     59                  supportive living\n    212                  family care\n      0                  personal care\n    312                  community residences\n    333                  intermediate care facilities\n    ___\n    916\n\nWhile these figures seem impressive many of them reflect placements of Willowbrook class members mandated\nby the terms of the Consent Judgment. Also included are placements of other clients who were never at the\nCenter.\nBoth state and privately operated community residences are funded by a combination of federal social security\nand state payments; each theoretically accounts for about 50% of the cost. Intermediate care facilities are funded\non a rate system, under which federal Medicaid monies pay for 50% of the cost, and state and local funds each\ncontribute 25%. For those clients who have lived in a state institution for five or more years, the state pays a\nlarger share of the cost.\nAccording to all the testimony on the point, the overall cost of care for a client living in the community was never\nmore than, and is generally significantly less than, that in an institution such as the Center. Defendants' expert,\nDr. Blanton, testified that ninety percent of the current Center population could be readily moved into the\ncommunity within five years, and that the cost of maintaining them there would be less than if they stayed at the\nCenter. A letter from Commissioner Slezak to the Deputy Majority Leader of the New York State Senate, states\nthat \"the overall costs for all community residential options is about 50% the cost of a developmental center.\" The\nletter, dated October 14, 1981, gave the following overall per client cost figures:\n  Voluntary operated community\n    residences                              $22,700\n  State operated community residences       $33,000\n  Voluntary operated intermediate care\n    facilities                              $46,400\n  Developmental Centers                     $53,200\n  Family Care Homes                         $14,200\n  Family Care, personal care                $16,200\n(Emphasis supplied.) These disparities in cost, while striking, probably do not fully reveal overall costs including\ncapital, support facilities and administrative supervision. Moreover, it must be remembered that the most difficult\ncases, on the average, remain at the Center. The figures do suggest, however, that compelling a reduction in\nCenter population will not place an impossible financial burden on the state.\n3. The Process of Developing Community Sites and Services\nThe bureaucratic maze, community pressures and practical problems all present barriers to providing community\nresidences for the mentally retarded. The Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities works\ndirectly with nineteen voluntary agencies in Long Island. Before a voluntary agency opens a community\nresidence or program, it first sends a letter of intent to the Associate Commissioner. The agency must then\ncomply with the state determination of need, called a Part 51 process for establishing day treatment programs,\nand a Part 53 process for the development of community residences. See 14 N.Y.C.R.R. §§ 51, 53. This calls for\n1340 proof of need for the program, of the competence of the agency to operate it, of financial *1340 responsibility, and\nof conformity to state and federal standards. A 60-day review period follows the agency's filing of a Part 51 or\nPart 53 application, during which representatives of the county certify it; if it does not receive county certification,\nthe application is returned to the agency for modification. Once certified by the county, the application is reviewed\nby the regional office of the federal Health Planning Commission, and again by the County Mental Health\ndepartment, both of which must also approve the application.\nIf the application is disapproved by the County, the Commissioner has the power to override the disapproval,\nthough there has never been an override in Nassau or Suffolk. Both Nassau and Suffolk have denied approval on\nnumerous occasions.\nNeed may also be established through the state's initiative. It publishes a request for a proposal, making known\nthe need for programs or services to serve a certain category of the handicapped.\n\nIf the plan for a community residence or intermediate care facility is approved, the state Facility Development\nCorporation works with a local site development unit to locate an appropriate house. When a potential site is\nfound, the town receives notice of the intent to establish a residence. See N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law, § 41.34. At\nthat point, the town has three options: it may either approve the site, offer an alternative site, or reject the site but\nonly on the basis of saturation. See N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law § 41.34.\nWith purchase negotiations, physical construction and renovations, and medical-safety certification, it takes about\n19 months from the time of the initial site selection for a home to open. Purchase negotiations may be\ncomplicated and drawn out. Unlike some other states, New York does not guarantee mortgages for the voluntary\nagencies so that they can more easily secure mortgages and purchase the home themselves.\nDefendants relied heavily on community opposition to community residences in explaining their lack of success in\ndeveloping community placements in Long Island. To counter such opposition, the state maintains offices of\nPublic Education and of Public Relations which staff various speakers bureaus throughout the state's twenty\nregional Developmental Disabilities Services Offices. In Long Island there are two full-time people assigned to\npublic education. They rely on various forms of the media as well as on speeches and face-to-face discussions\nwith opponents.\nThough community opposition has apparently led to three instances of arson in Long Island, no client has ever\nbeen harmed. A state study indicated that community resistance derives from, first, fear that a neighborhood's\nproperty values would be diminished if a community residence were established, and, second, from fear of the\nmentally retarded 00 as violent, dangerous, unfriendly persons. Both of these fears appear to be unfounded.\n97\nOne state study demonstrated that the presence of a community residence in a neighborhood had no effect on\nproperty values. \"Group Homes for the Mentally Retarded: An Investigation of Neighborhood Property Impacts.\"\nFear of mentally retarded persons may in part be attributed to the public's confusion of the mentally ill with the\nmentally retarded. As Gary Shaw, who once led the opposition to a community residence that was established in\nhis neighborhood in Valley Stream, Long Island, explained:\nWe were afraid of any sort of mental handicap. We didn't know that there was any difference. We\nwere thinking of child molesting; I have eight nieces and nephews and I swore that the first one\nwho ever came through the bushes in my parents' yard, I would shoot.\n[The community residence] is directly across the street from a school, and we were afraid, being\nadult bodies with children's minds, they would have problems of playing with kids.\nBoth plaintiffs and defendants agreed that such fear is best refuted by the community's experience with their\n1341 retarded neighbors. Gary Shaw now regards his retarded *1341 neighbors as his friends; he visits them in their\nhome, and they visit him in his. The property value in his neighborhood has increased. Moreover, Shaw works\nwith other communities in Nassau and Suffolk who are resisting group homes. \"I would tell the people, I know\nwhere you are coming from, I know what you are afraid of, I went through it, and you don't have to worry.\"\nJulia Benjamin, who lives next door to a group home in Greenport, Long Island, considers the home a benefit to\nher community. She testified because she thought\nthis case would affect people that are at Suffolk Developmental Center now, possibly, and I see\nthe way that the people next door are, and I feel that they have a nice life, and they have\nimproved, and [are] doing well, and I think everybody should be able to.\nIV. LAW AND ITS APPLICATION\nPlaintiffs based their claims on several legal theories, invoking the federal and New York State constitutions, the\nDevelopmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6011 et seq., Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and various provisions of the New York Mental Hygiene Law. They argue that\ndeficiencies in the physical environment, number and training of staff, substance and implementation of therapies\n\nand of developmental plans, and in the amount and nature of the programming make the Center incapable of\nproviding adequate care, treatment and habilitation to its residents, of protecting them from harm, and of\npreventing their regression. For these reasons, they maintain that community placement of all the residents of the\nCenter is the most appropriate form of relief.\nA. Due Process Right to Minimally Adequate Care and Treatment\nIn Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), the Supreme Court held that the\n\"liberty interests\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provide mentally retarded\npersons in state institutions substantive rights to conditions of reasonable care and safety, freedom from undue\nrestraint, and to that level of \"minimally adequate or reasonable training [necessary] to ensure safety and\nfreedom from undue restraint.\" 102 S.Ct. at 2458-2463.\nConstitutionally \"reasonable care\" requires that the state provide adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical\ncare. 102 S.Ct. at 2462. The right to freedom from undue restraint means that the state \"may not restrain\nresidents except when and to the extent professional judgment deems this necessary to assure such safety or to\nprovide needed training.\" Id.\nThe level of training required places the state under a duty to provide a retarded client \"such training as an\nappropriate professional would consider reasonable to ensure his safety and to facilitate his ability to function free\nfrom bodily restraints.\" Id. Although the Court found that no question of a general constitutional right to\n\"habilitation\" was presented, 102 S.Ct. at 2459, and thus declined to address the issue, it noted that \"[i]t may well\nbe unreasonable not to provide training when training could significantly reduce the need for restraints or the\nlikelihood of violence.\" Id. at 2462-2463. Specifically it indicated that respondent Romeo had been denied\ntraining, including self-care programs, that professional experts agreed were needed to reduce his aggressive\nbehavior. Id. at 2459.\nJustice Blackmun's concurrence, joined by two other members of the Court, elaborated on the minimal level of\ntraining called for. It pointed out that the Constitution requires that an institutional resident be provided with \"such\ntraining as is reasonably necessary to prevent a person's pre-existing self-care skills from deteriorating because\nof his commitment.\" Thus,\nThe Court makes clear ... that even after a person is committed to a state institution, he is entitled\nto such training as is necessary to prevent unreasonable losses of additional liberty as a result of\n1342 his confinement 00 for example, unreasonable bodily restraints or unsafe institutional *1342\n97\nconditions. If a person could demonstrate that he entered a state institution with minimal self-care\nskills, but lost those skills after commitment because of the State's unreasonable refusal to\nprovide him with training, then, it seems to me, he has alleged a loss of liberty quite distinct from\n00 and as serious as 00 the loss of safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints. For many\n97 97\nmentally retarded people, the difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within\nan institution and total dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as\nthey ever will know.\n102 S.Ct. at 2464.\nInherent then in the Supreme Court's vision of that level of training to which mentally retarded residents of state\ninstitutions are constitutionally entitled is a recognition that such basic self-care skills as the ability to dress\noneself and attend to one's own hygiene needs are requisite to any exercise of those \"liberty interests\" protected\nby the Due Process Clause. 102 S.Ct. at 2464. All of the qualified professionals, both plaintiffs and defendants,\nwho testified in this case agreed that the denial to a resident with the capacity to do so of the opportunity to learn\nto speak and to toilet, to dress and feed himself would constitute a professionally unacceptable restraint.\nIn accordance with the Court's instruction in Romeo that deference be paid to the judgment of qualified\nprofessionals, 102 S.Ct. at 2461-62, the testimony and other proof dictate that training in basic self-care skills be\n\nprovided as a constitutional right. See Association for Retarded Children of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp.\n473, 487 (D.N.D.1982):\n... training in walking or basic communication would be required if the resident could benefit\ntherefrom, since these skills enable the exercise of basic liberties.\nFurther, the right to minimally adequate training can be reasonably construed to grant a right to\nreasonable training which enables the resident to acquire or maintain minimum self-care skills 00\n97\nskills in feeding, bathing, dressing, self-control, and toilet training.... Given the great difference that\nminimum self-care skills make in the life of most mentally retarded persons, this court regards the\nacquisition and maintenance of those skills as essential to the exercise of basic liberties.\n(Emphasis in original.) Cf. O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 569, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2490, 45 L.Ed.2d 396\n(1975)\n(finding unconstitutional confinement of nondangerous individual capable of surviving safely on own where\n\"confinement was a simple regime of enforced custodial care, not a program designed to alleviate or cure his\nsupposed illness\"); Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1858, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972) (\"At the\nleast, due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the\npurpose for which the individual is committed.\").\nCourts \"must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.\" Romeo, 102 S.Ct. 2452,\n2461. Such judgments by those qualified through training \"or experience,\" 102 S.Ct. at 2462, are to be treated as\npresumptively valid; \"liability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a substantial\ndeparture from accepted professional judgment, practice or standards as to demonstrate that the person\nresponsible actually did not base the decision on the judgment.\" Id. at 2462.\nAlthough Romeo was decided in the context of an involuntarily committed mentally retarded person, the\nconstitutional protections it describes embrace residents of state institutions for the retarded, including those\nwhose commitment may have been technically voluntary. See Association for Retarded Citizens of North Dakota\nv. Olson, 561 F.Supp. at 485 (\"An individual's liberty is not less worthy of protection merely because he has\nconsented to be placed in a situation of confinement.\"); Garrity v. Gallen, 522 F.Supp. 171, 239 (D.N.H.1981); \n1343 Philipp v. Carey, 517 F.Supp. 513, 518-519 (N.D.N.Y.1981); Kentucky Association for*1343Retarded Citizens v.\nConn, 510 F.Supp. 1233, 1248 (W.D.Ky.1980); New York State Association for Retarded Children v. Carey, 393\nF.Supp. 715, 718 (E.D.N.Y.1975).\nParticularly where, as in this case, those unable to care for their retarded relatives at home have no real option\nbut to place their children and siblings at the Center, the distinction between the voluntarily and involuntarily\ncommitted is meaningless. The defendants do not disagree. As the Director of the Center stated at the close of\nthe trial, \"the role of the state residential facility is to be the court of last resort for those people who can't be\nserved any place else.\" So far as the client is concerned, he or she has no say in the matter. The mentally\nretarded client's stay in the institution must be deemed involuntary.\nRomeo interprets the Fourteenth Amendment as guaranteeing four specific sets of rights to the residents of the\nCenter. These may be characterized as follows:\n1. A right to adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care;\n2. A right to reasonably safe conditions;\n3. A right to freedom from restraint, except insofar as professional judgments determine such restraints necessary\nto assure a resident's safety or to provide needed training; and\n4. A right to such training as professional judgment determines is reasonable to ensure a resident's safety and to\nfacilitate his or her ability to function free from bodily restraints.\nFrom 1978 when this case began through the present, these rights have been and continue to be denied the\nresidents at Suffolk Developmental Center.\n\n1. Right to Adequate Food, Shelter, Clothing and Medical Care\na. Adequate Food\nIn some cases, the Center has not provided constitutionally adequate food to its residents. The problem,\ngenerally, is not the quality of the food itself, but understaffing and program deficiencies which effectively permit\ncertain residents with aggressive behaviors to grab food from others, who thus do not receive enough. Russell\nCohen, for example, developed regurgitating behavior while a resident of Building 26, Ward B, because,\naccording to the diagnosis of an outside hospital, he was not receiving enough food. Since food was being\nserved, the staff in that ward concluded that the grabbers took Russell's food. After Lisa Gorelick was admitted to\nthe Center, her parents found her \"about half the weight she was and completely limp.\" They immediately brought\nher to an outside hospital, which diagnosed her condition as dehydration, and kept her for treatment for two\nweeks.\nb. Adequate Shelter\nIn the most recent report of May 1982, the survey team found 58 pages of environmental, maintenance,\nsanitation, safety, and programmatic violations, and timely completion of only 18% of scheduled preventive\nmaintenance. The Center is faced with constant problems with its air conditioning and heating systems; with\nrecurrent invasions of rodents and cockroaches; with transportation and equipment breakdowns; with shortages\nof supplies such as bed linens and toothpaste; and with periodic outbreaks of shigella, hepatitis and other\ninfectious diseases.\nOne of the defendants' experts admitted that with regard to the physical plant, \"there are substantial deficiencies\nwhich don't quite reach the minimal standards that are now in effect by the Federal Government.\" For substantial\nperiods and for substantial numbers of residents, defendants are not providing constitutionally required adequate\nshelter.\nc. Adequate Clothing\nResidents are not consistently provided with clean, adequate and appropriate clothing. Occasionally, they are not\nclothed at all.\nWith some exceptions such as the residents of Building 19 (the pulmonary unit), clients seen by plaintiffs' experts\n1344 were not dressed appropriately, but rather *1344 wore dirty, torn and ill-fitting garments. Nor is enough adaptive\nclothing currently provided at the Center to meet the constitutional minimum. Not only does the failure to provide\nsuch clothing contravene the state's constitutional duty, but it also denies to those clients needing such clothing\nthat level of training constitutionally required for the maintenance or acquisition of such fundamental self-care\nskills as dressing and toileting.\nIn some cases, the failure to supply special clothing, or to provide access to that special clothing provided by the\nresident's parent or relative, may endanger the resident's health. Nicolina Coster, for example, a 50 year old\nresident of Building 2, suffers from lymphatic anemia, a blockage of the lymph glands, in her right leg. As a result,\nif she does not wear orthopedic shoes and special bandages, her leg becomes infected. Although Ms. Coster\ncame to the Center with two pairs of the shoes and several bandages, she does not wear them.\nd. Adequate Medical Care\nThere are not enough doctors, dentists and nurses to provide adequate medical care to all of the residents. One\nor two doctors on call at night and on the weekends for a population of 1,200, many of whom have substantial\nmedical problems, are not enough to meet constitutional minima. Lack of sufficient dental care caused Susan\n\nFeibusch's gums to deteriorate, necessitating the surgical removal of nine of her teeth. It is plain that resident\nDennis Silverman's right to adequate care was violated when the post-operative therapy ordered by his doctor to\nprevent the paralysis of his legs was not performed. The continued failure to repair ambulances prevents the\nprovision of adequate medical care outside the institution.\nThe inability of the clinical staff to provide adequate medical care is compounded by the general shortage of\ndirect care staff. Staff on the wards may be so overburdened, or tired due to long shifts, that they may not know a\nresident has been injured, and thus be unable to provide necessary medical care. Use of floating staff, who are\nnot familiar with the clients, necessitated by the staffing shortage, as well as by administrative staffing policies,\nhas led to certain residents, mistaken for others, being given the wrong medications.\n2. Right to Reasonably Safe Conditions\nThe state's denial of adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care has the effect of violating the residents'\nconstitutional right to safe conditions. These factors in combination with the problems of understaffing, floating\nstaff, lack of programs and adequate treatment plans, and lack of staff familiarity with such plans, create an\nenvironment that cannot protect, within constitutional minima, residents from harm.\nWithout direct care staff that is adequately trained in programming, or aware of treatment plans, that level of\ntraining which is necessary to preserve the physical safety of the residents, cannot be provided. The absence of\nprograms and adequate treatment plans for those with negative behavior that cause injury both to themselves,\nand to other residents, and lack of staff familiarity with, or access to, such plans or programs where they do exist,\ntogether with the fact that clients often receive little attention due to general understaffing and concomitant staff\nfatigue, the use of a critical minimum policy and of floating staff, and lack of adequate staff training and\nsupervision, have led to many incidents, accidents, and epidemics at the Center, often resulting in serious injury\nand, occasionally, death. Michael Maggio died from swallowing plastic gloves; Eileen S., 26, died of scalding\nburns; Wayne W., nine years old, died of bilateral pneumonia; Robert M., 34, was dead from an apparent seizure\nafter an abnormal brain wave pattern was ignored; James P., 30 years old, who was placed in a locked \"time-out\"\nroom alone in violation of Center policy, fell out of a first-floor window, breaking his arm; Teresa, 27 years old,\nbanged her head on unprotected cribs or carts without any intervention by nearby staff; Lisa Gorelick, 22, was\n1345 blinded in one eye because of uncontrolled *1345 head-banging; Robert Stutz, a 36 year-old man, required 17\nstitches over one eye and 14 over the other because of injuries inflicted by himself or other inmates; Nicolina\nCoster, 50, was repeatedly beaten by another resident while the staff person on duty continued to watch\ntelevision; and Dennis Silverman, 37, was found sitting on a bed of vermin.\nOther types of safety hazards include defective fire alarms. At the June hearing the Director admitted that the hot\nwater safety valves were not operating properly, increasing the possibility of scalding in showers.\nThe persistent practice of feeding nonambulatory residents in a supine position is an improper and dangerous\ntechnique that can cause aspiration of food into the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, scarring, decreased lung\nvolume, reduced life span and even death. In one month, November 1981, three of the four deaths occurring at\nthe Center were linked to aspiration or pneumonia, while the fourth was traced to intestinal obstruction and fecal\nimpaction, related to ingestion of inedible objects or neglect of client needs.\nPrevalent at the Center are epidemics of such serious diseases as shigella, hepatitis, diarrhea, pneumonia,\nchicken pox, measles, and mumps. Shigella, which results in diarrhea, bloody stool, and fever, is transmitted by\nfecal contamination; hepatitis, a liver infection, can be airborne or, in the case of hepatitis B, spread through fecal\nmatter or some type of intimate contact such as biting. Both can be prevented by basic sanitary and\nhousekeeping measures and by proper supervision of clients. Such diseases are less likely to be found in small\ncommunity residences serving the same type of clients.\nThe Center's system for reviewing and preventing incidents and injuries by the Incident Review Committee has\nadmittedly been ineffective. Until September 1, 1982, there was no formal system consistently monitoring the\nfollow-up recommendations made by the Incident Review Committee. Thus, in defendants' own example of the\noperation of the Incident Review Committee regarding a client (Joseph S.) who fell and cut his chin because of a\n\nseizure, Deputy Director Stanley Slawinski, the administrator responsible for institutional monitoring, could not\nsay, 16 months after the incident occurred, whether Joseph ever was given the chin guard or the barrel chair\nrecommended by the Committee.\nAll of the experts but one agreed that in some respects the Center is not providing its residents safe conditions.\nEven the one witness offered by defendants who testified that the Center did provide a safe environment for its\nclients, was dubious about many aspects of the Center's activities. The consensus of the qualified professionals,\nthen, is that the Center does not provide its clients conditions of reasonable safety, contrary to what is\nconstitutionally required under Romeo.\nThe long list of institutional deficiencies is not due to any professional judgment. The Director and staff are not\ncallous or indifferent. They know that they are not supplying the services their training and roles require.\nSubstantial departures from acceptable standards \"demonstrate\" that they do not base their decisions to deprive\ntheir clients on their professional \"judgment,\" 102 S.Ct. at 2462, but rather on the failure of the state to provide\nfunds and freedom of action.\nLack of personnel capable of exercising professional judgment in many individual cases itself represents a failure\nto provide constitutionally safe conditions. In Romeo, the Supreme Court specified that \"[l]ongterm treatment\ndecisions normally should be made by persons with degrees in medicine or nursing, or with appropriate [clinical]\ntraining ...\"; \"... day-to-day decisions regarding care 00 including decisions that must be made without delay 00\n97 97\nnecessarily will be made in many instances by employees without formal training but who are subject to the\nsupervision of qualified persons.\" 102 S.Ct. at 2462 n. 30. At the Center, both long-term and day-to-day decisions\n1346 are often made by persons who do not meet the Supreme Court's standard. This *1346 failure increases the\nprobability that the decisions made for and about the residents may not guarantee their constitutional level of\nsafety.\nThe lack of enough clinical staff means that long-term treatment decisions may be made by those without\nsufficient training or that such decisions may never be made. The effect is to deny residents a plan or program for\nlong-term treatment, as well as the right to adequate medical care and the right to that minimally adequate or\nreasonable training guaranteed by the Constitution.\nWithout adequately updated psychological evaluations, long-term psychological treatment decisions cannot be\nappropriately made. A recent survey found that half the records reviewed in Building 28 lacked updated\npsychological evaluations. Inadequate training and supervision of direct care staff mean that many \"day-to-day\ndecisions\" may not be made by those who are professionally competent to make them. Shortage of staff and the\ncritical number policy often result in low staff morale and fatigue, which are increased by too few breaks and\nshifts that can range up to 16 hours. These may affect client safety and may contribute to client abuse. For\nexample, there was testimony about a beating by a member of the staff observed by another member; no action\nwas taken to prosecute. In another instance, bootmarks were found on one boy's body matching boots of the\nshower attendant.\n3. Right to Freedom from Undue Restraint\nUnnecessary restraints are placed on the residents. The most obvious example is the locking of otherwise\nambulatory persons into wheelchairs with confining lapboards and failure to put on braces required for walking.\nAbsence of safely equipped vehicles to transport those who cannot walk, and are confined in wheelchairs or\ncarts, unnecessarily curtails their opportunities to participate in programming and other activities both on and off\nthe grounds of the Center. Lack of enough appropriately equipped vehicles operates as an undue restraint on\nboth the ambulatory and non-ambulatory, since it deprives them of the freedom to make personal choices of what\nto wear and what to eat by preventing them from visiting shops, restaurants, and recreational facilities. See \nAssociation for Retarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. at 486 (\"This right [to freedom from\nundue restraint] obligates the state to provide capable retarded citizens with reasonable opportunities to make\ntrips into the outside communities.\"). See also Note, Beyond Youngberg: Protecting the Fundamental Rights of\nthe Mentally Retarded, 51 Fordham L.Rev. 1064, 1072-1074 (1983). Clients are restrained by drugs, which have\n\nbeen used, according to the Director of Nursing, instead of treatment plans. The fact that there are so many\nlocked doors to buildings, to dayrooms within the buildings, to bathrooms, and to sleeping areas functions as\nanother restraint.\nPlaintiffs' experts were in agreement that the living environment at the Center had a harmful, negative effect on\nthe residents and created a situation in which learning was not possible. The very restrictiveness of the Center\nsetting, necessitated by the number of people living there, makes it impossible for the residents to acquire the\nskills necessary for success in a less restrictive environment.\nThe physical restraints that necessarily result from understaffing and those inherent in institutional life, are\nheightened by the absence of consistent reinforcing programming. If each client were receiving individual\nprogramming appropriate to his or her needs, then not all of a group of clients would need to be restrained on\naccount of a few individuals.\nSome residents, such as Laura Knapp, are unduly physically restrained by living in the Center. They are capable\nof much freer and more productive activities in small group community based homes. For these individuals, the\n1347 Constitution mandates placement in a group home, or in *1347 some other situation in the community, where\nthey can effectively exercise their proven ability to live independently. As resident Laura Knapp herself so\npoignantly put it:\nI have been living in institutions, various institutions, for most of my life and I would like to go and\nsee what it's like to live at somebody's house and be, like you know, once in a while, to get that\nkind of love that other kids get.\nIn Romeo, as noted above, the Supreme Court did not decide whether the Due Process Clause embraces a\ngeneral right to habilitation. See102 S.Ct. at 2459\n. Lower courts, however, have supported the theory of a right to a least restrictive alternative requiring some\nhabilitation. See generally Philipp v. Carey, 517 F.Supp. 513, 518 (N.D. N.Y.1981) (mentally retarded residents of\nstate-run Syracuse Developmental Center have Due Process claim \"to treatment in settings that pass muster\nunder an appropriate least restrictive alternative inquiry\"); Welsch v. Likins, 373 F.Supp. 487, 501-502\n(D.Minn.1974),vacated in part and remanded in part,550 F.2d 1122 (8th Cir.1977) (Due Process Clause requires\nstate to \"make good faith attempts to place [mentally retarded] persons in settings that will be suitable and\nappropriate to their mental and physical conditions while least restrictive of their liberties\"); cf. Wyatt v. Stickney,\n344 F.Supp. 387, 390 (M.D.Ala.1972),aff'd sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974).\nIn the case before us we need not find any abstract constitutional right to a least restrictive environment. That\nentitlement is accepted as professionally required by the testimony and is implied in the explicit right to care and\ntreatment provided by state law. See Project Release v. Prevost, 551 F.Supp. 1298, 1305 (E.D.N.Y.1982); Woe v.\nMathews, 408 F.Supp. 419, 428 (E.D. N.Y.1976); aff'd sub nom. Woe v. Weinberger, 562 F.2d 40 (2d Cir.1977);\nNew York Mental Hygiene Law §§ 15.01, 15.03, 33.03(a). Community placements for those current institutional\nresidents who can adjust outside the institution is required by New York law. See New York Mental Hygiene Law\n§ 33.03(a).\nDeference to the judgment of a qualified professional, Youngberg v. Romeo, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2641, also dictates\nthis result. All experts, both defendants' and plaintiffs', agreed that many clients of the Center could be safer,\nhappier and more productive outside the institution in small community residences. Their professional judgment\nwas that transfers should be made as soon as the facilities could be made available and, that the state was\ncapable of providing them in large numbers relatively quickly. The Constitution mandates community placement\nfor those who have been adjudged by qualified professionals to require a community setting in order to exercise\nbasic liberty interests, which would otherwise be denied them by what are for them the undue restraints inherent\nin institutional life. See Association for Retarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson, 561 F.Supp. 473, 486.\nAll of the residents of the Center have been referred for placement in the community. There was much testimony\nthat physical and behavioral handicaps are not barriers to such placements. Defendants' expert Richard Blanton\ntestified that, with the appropriate arrangements, 90% of the current Center population could be served in the\ncommunity. By failing to provide enough community placements, and accompanying educational or workshop day\n\nprograms, the defendants have unduly restrained many residents for whom institutional life precludes the\nexercise of basic liberties.\n4. Right to Minimally Adequate Training\nUnder Romeo, the Constitution requires that a state institution provide that level of training which is determined\nby a qualified professional to \"be reasonable in light of [the resident's] liberty interests in safety and freedom from\nunreasonable restraints.\" 102 S.Ct. at 2452. As noted earlier, the Court's analysis of constitutionally reasonable\n1348 training, as highlighted in Justice Blackmun's concurrence, included a requirement *1348 that minimum self-care\nskills be maintained. See102 S.Ct. at 2462-2465; Association for Retarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Olson,\n561 F.Supp. 473, 487 (D.N.D. 1982). In the case of an individual who entered an institution with self-care skills\nlost due to the state's failure to provide training, this right, Romeo indicates, would be violated. See102 S.Ct. at\n2464. Similarly, the Constitution requires the institution to provide the resident with training to acquire such self-\ncare skills, since this \"is as much liberty as they will ever know.\" Id.\nThe record contained numerous examples of precisely the sort of regression condemned in Justice Blackmun's\nconcurring opinion. Loss of skills was caused by programming and other deficiencies. The Center has not\nprovided its residents with the minimal training required by the Constitution. This conclusion is supported by the\ntestimony of the qualified professionals presented by both plaintiffs and defendants, of parents and relatives of\nresidents, as well as by numerous citations in the survey reports.\nNor has the Center provided the training to enable those capable of learning basic self-care techniques to acquire\nthem. Toilet training of many is inadequate or nonexistent. Absence of feeding and physical and speech therapy\nprograms prevents many residents from feeding and expressing themselves and moving independently 00 basic\n97\nskills essential to the exercise of the most fundamental liberties. See Note, Beyond Youngberg: Protecting the\nFundamental Rights of the Mentally Retarded, 51 Fordham L.Rev. 1064, 1080-1085 (1983).\nThe absence of behavior modification programs, and other therapies designed to treat self-abusive and other\nmaladaptive behaviors also contravenes the residents' constitutional guarantee of training under Romeo. It\ndenies to them the protection of their liberty interests in safety and freedom from undue restraint. Without\nappropriate programs individuals with such behaviors will harm both themselves and other residents, and may\nbe, as they have been, subjected to control by otherwise unnecessary psychotropic drugs which can cause or\naggravate the behaviors they are supposed to eliminate.\nThe record proves that while at the Center many clients have developed harmful or inappropriate habits (such as\nhead-banging, feces eating, eye-gouging, and biting), which at least in part may be attributed to the effects of\ntheir unstimulating environment. The Center lacks resources to deal adequately with these and other\ninappropriate behaviors. Among the other ill effects of the failure to deal with these problems, is that they can\ndelay or impede a client's movement into the community, and thereby further restrain him or her unnecessarily.\nThere were no behavior modification programs available at the Center between 1978 and 1980. None existed in\nlate 1981. Although some clients now receive one-to-one staff attention, the employees assigned to these clients\nare usually nonprofessionals who are unaware of the contents or existence of the required programs for dealing\nwith this behavior. There is a general absence of programs to deal with clients who bang their heads, bite,\nscratch, kick others, and engage in other forms of self-stimulation and self-abuse. Without a staff that knows how\nto implement such programs where they do exist, clients are denied the minimal programming to which they are\nconstitutionally entitled.\nFailure to provide adequate programming has created a vicious cycle. Clients learn inappropriate behavior in the\ninstitution. This gives rise to or increases their need for behavioral programming. When this programming is not\nforthcoming, the clients continue to deteriorate, to the point where they suffer serious intellectual, emotional, and\nphysical damage and, at some point, an irreversible loss of potential.\nThe testimony of the qualified professionals bears out the inevitable conclusion that the residents of the Center\nare denied that training requisite to the maintenance and acquisition of basic self-care skills, as well as that\n\n1349 necessary to ensure their safety and freedom from undue restraint. Conditions *1349 at the Center meet none of\nthe constitutionally minimal standards set forth in Romeo.\nPlaintiffs have argued that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment entitles them to the same\ntreatment as members of the Willowbrook class. New York State Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey,\n393 F.Supp. 715 (1975); New York State Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Rockefeller, 357 F.Supp. 752\n(1973). They note that more money is spent per capita on the Willowbrook class than on Center residents; that\nthe former class receives more programming and a higher staff ratio; and that placement of the Willowbrook class\nin community facilities is proceeding at a more rapid rate. Conditions at Willowbrook were much worse than they\nare now at the Suffolk Center. Improvements to correct the Willowbrook class' prior deprivations, do not\nnecessarily set a standard required to be followed in every state institution. See New York State Association for\nRetarded Children v. Carey, 393 F.Supp. 715, 717 (1975). It follows, therefore, that the programming and staffing\nrequirements of the Willowbrook Consent Decree need not necessarily be afforded residents of the Suffolk\nCenter.\nB. Federal Statutes\nThe plaintiffs' claims for improved conditions are supported by federal statutory law. While the Supreme Court\nheld in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981),\nthat section 6010 of the Developmentally Disabled and Bill of Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6001 et seq., setting\nforth \"Congressional findings respecting the rights of the developmentally disabled,\" did not create substantive\nentitlements, 451 U.S. at 11, 19, 101 S.Ct. at 1536, 1540, the Court's decision did not preclude the possibility of\nstatutory liability arising from violations of other sections of the act.\nThe Court's finding that the section 6010 bill of rights provisions were \"hortatory, not mandatory,\" 451 U.S. at 24,\n101 S.Ct. at 1543, was based on the absence of language specifying compliance as a condition for the grant of\nfederal funds. See451 U.S. at 22-27, 101 S.Ct. at 1542-1544 (specifically distinguishing section 6063(b)(5) from\nsection 6010 in that it imposes a \"specific condition\"; and noting that in regard to \"the well-settled distinction\nbetween Congressional `encouragement' of state programs and the imposition of binding obligations on the\nState,\" the crucial inquiry is \"whether Congress spoke so clearly that we can fairly say that the State could make\nan informed choice.\").\nOther provisions of the act, such as Section 6011 require individual written habilitation plans containing specific\nstatements of long-term and immediate objectives, expressed in behavioral or otherwise measurable terms, and\nimplementation strategies for each developmentally disabled person. Unlike Section 6010, Section 6011 was\nenacted by Congress under the Spending Power. See Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 23, 101 S.Ct. at 1542. Compliance\nwith its enumerated conditions is obligatory. See Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 27-29, 101 S.Ct. at 1545-1546. As\ndetailed in the discussion of individual treatment plans above, the treatment plans at the Center do not meet the\nstatutory requirements for individualized habilitation plans set out in 42 U.S.C. § 6011. See also Garrity v. Gallen,\n522 F.Supp. 171, 213-215 (D.N.H.1981) (holding that Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 20 U.S.C. § 794 is\n\"predicated upon the need for individualized treatment,\" and thus requires an adequately documented\nindividualized treatment plan for each resident of the state institution for the mentally retarded). Discussion of\nfunding and of inspections and certifications by federal authorities demonstrate that federal statutory authority\nand funding is intended to ensure that the rights of Center residents under federal statutes are enforceable.\nNevertheless, the decree is based upon constitutional, not statutory, rights. Thus it is not necessary to decide the\nprecise reach of federal statutes under Pennhurst.\n1350  C. State Law\n*1350\nNo state policy need be balanced against the constitutional command since the state's statutes support and go\nfurther than what the Constitution requires. The New York State Mental Hygiene Law explicitly provides mentally\nretarded and developmentally disabled citizens with a right to care and treatment. The state legislature\nspecifically delegated to the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities\n\nthe responsibility for seeing that mentally retarded and developmentally disabled persons ... are\nprovided with care and treatment, that such care and treatment is of high quality and\neffectiveness, and that the personal and civil rights of persons receiving care and treatment are\nadequately protected.\nNew York Mental Hygiene Law § 13.07(c). See Woe v. Mathews, 408 F.Supp. 419, 427-428 (E.D.N.Y.1976),aff'd\nsub nom. Woe v. Weinberger, 562 F.2d 40 (2d Cir.1977); see also Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 31, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 1546, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981) (right to treatment secured by state law\nmay provide an independent and adequate ground to support lower court's order for community placement of\nresidents of state institution for the mentally retarded).\nOther provisions of the Mental Hygiene Law require humane treatment, New York Mental Hygiene Law §§ 13.21\n(b), 33.03(a), written treatment plans with a statement of treatment goals and of the appropriate programs to be\nundertaken to meet such goals, Id. § 29.13(a), (b), and an appropriate free public education for mentally retarded\nand developmentally disabled children between ages five and twenty-one. Id. § 33.11; cf. The Education for All\nHandicapped Children Act of 1975, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401 et seq. An institutional resident's right to custody of his or\nher personal property is specified. New York Mental Hygiene Law § 33.07. The state legislature has been\nparticularly concerned about providing for the development of community residences for the mentally disabled.\nL.1978, c. 468, § 1, New York Mental Hygiene Law §§ 41.33, 41.34.\nMany of the residents of the Center are not receiving the care and treatment to which they are entitled under\nstate law. The testimony from both plaintiffs' and defendants' witnesses established that the Center does not\nprovide each resident with programming of \"high quality and effectiveness;\" some receive no programming at all.\nNor do all the treatment plans conform to the requirements of state law. Frequently, the residents' rights to\npersonal property is not respected, in contravention of state law.\nFinally, defendants' failure to develop community placements and services thwarts state legislative intent, as well\nas denying many of the state's mentally retarded citizens, what defendants say everyone should have 00 \"the\n97\nopportunity to live life to the fullest.\" As the Supreme Court once mused:\nFor the welfare of his Ideal Commonwealth, Plato suggested a law which should provide: \"That\nthe wives of our guardians are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent\nis to know his own child, nor any child his parent.... The proper officers will take the offspring of the\ngood parents to the pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a\nseparate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of the better when they chance to be\ndeformed, will be put away in some mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.\".... Although\nsuch measures have been deliberately approved by men of great genius, their ideas touching the\nrelation between individual and State were wholly different from those upon which our institutions\nrest; and it hardly will be affirmed that any legislature could impose such restrictions upon the\npeople of a State without doing violence to both letter and spirit of the Constitution.\nMeyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401-402, 43 S.Ct. 625, 627-628, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923) (emphasis added).\n1351  V. SUMMARY OF CONSTITUTIONAL FAILURES\n*1351\nThere is no doubt that the initiation of this lawsuit, together with Director Fred McCormack's stewardship of the\nfacility, has led to better conditions at the Center. The quality of life has been improved in the last few years. The\nfact remains, however, that continued residence at the Center is harmful to many of the residents. Defendants'\nfailure to expeditiously develop enough appropriate day and residential programs in the community for the current\npopulation at the Center also amounts to a constitutional deprivation of many of their rights. See Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.\nPlaintiffs and defendants are both to be commended for their efforts in improving the environment at the Center.\nYet staffing and other factors endemic to the management of a large facility make it an environment that fails to\n\nprotect the safety of its residents, to prevent their regression, and to provide an opportunity to acquire those skills\nrequisite to self protection and development.\nIn assessing remedies the court must be aware that funds necessarily expended for those who are members of\nthis class may affect funds made available to those residing in their families' home. In this case, the dilemma is\nnot as exquisite as it might have been were budgeted amounts for one group to be shifted by the executive to\nmeet the demands of a decree. In any event, lack of funds for one group is not an excuse for denying\nconstitutional rights to another. See Welsch v. Likins, 550 F.2d 1122, 1132 (8th Cir.1977),aff'g,373 F.Supp. 487,\n497-498 (D.Minn.1974); Lapeer Oakdale Parents Ass'n for Retarded Citizens v. Ochberg, 492 F.Supp. 1035,\n1037 (E.D.Mich. 1980); Lora v. Board of Education of New York, 456 F.Supp. 1211, 1292-1293 (E.D.N. Y.1978),\nvacated and remanded on other grounds,623 F.2d 248 (2d Cir.1980); Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 373, 377\n(M.D.Ala. 1972),aff'd sub nom; Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974).\nVI. PROPOSED PLAN OF DIRECTOR\nIn its interim order of February 24, 1983, the court found that conditions at the Center did not meet\nconstitutionally minimal standards. It ordered the Director to submit a plan correcting constitutional deficiencies.\nOn April 24, 1983, the plan was submitted. This plan lacked detailed steps, timetables, specific numbers of clients\nto be served, dollars involved, and explicit implementation.\nDefendant McCormack has noted that he was constrained by fiscal and other policy determinations by the state.\nSuch constraints cannot justify the continued constitutional deprivations to which New York State has subjected\nthe residents of the Center. See Arthur v. Nyquist, 712 F.2d 809 at 814 (2d Cir.1983) (\"a court is entitled to\nrequire money for programs that materially aid the success of the overall desegregation effort\"); Lapeer Oakdale\nParents Ass'n for Retarded Citizens v. Ochberg, 492 F.Supp. 1035, 1037 (E.D.Mich. 1980); Welsch v. Likins, 373\nF.Supp. 487, 498 (D.Minn.1974) (\"It does not suffice ... to show that conditions have been upgraded at [the state\ninstitution], that the situation will continue to improve in the future, and that even more achievements would be\nforthcoming were it not for the restrictions imposed by the legislature. It is the Court's duty under the Constitution,\nto assure that every resident ... receives at least minimally adequate care and treatment consonant with the full\nand true meaning of the due process clause.\"), aff'd,550 F.2d 1122 (8th Cir.1977); id. at 1132 (\"If [the state]\nchooses to operate hospitals for the mentally retarded, the operation must meet minimal constitutional standards,\nand that obligation may not be permitted to yield to financial considerations.\"). See also Sherry v. New York State\nEduc. Dep't, 479 F.Supp. 1328, 1339 (W.D.N.Y.1979); Lora v. Bd. of Educ. of New York, 456 F.Supp. 1211,\n1292-1293 (E.D.N.Y.1979),vacated and remanded on other grounds,623 F.2d 248 (2d Cir.1980).\n1352 *1352 The Director's plan was analyzed in detail at public hearings held on June 20 and 23, 1983. Witnesses\nwere heard. The court, after consultation with the parties, made line by line changes in the Director's proposals.\nThese decisions are embodied in the decree.\nVII. DECREE\nA. Supervision\nPlaintiffs ask that a master or committee on the Willowbrook model be appointed to supervise execution of the\ndecree. See, e.g., Halderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hosp., 446 F.Supp. 1295, 1326-1328 (E.D.Penn.1977)\n(appointing and specifying tasks of special master), aff'd in part and rev'd and remanded in part,612 F.2d 84 (3d\nCir.1979),rev'd and remanded,451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981),aff'd on other grounds,673\nF.2d 647 (3d Cir.1982),modified,545 F.Supp. 410 (E.D.Penn.1982); Hart v. Community School Board, 383\nF.Supp. 699 (E.D.N.Y. 1974),aff'd,512 F.2d 37 (2d Cir.1975); NYSARC, Inc. v. Rockefeller, 357 F.Supp. 752\n(E.D.N.Y.1973), 393 F.Supp. 715 (E.D.N. Y.1975). See generally Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc.\nv. Carey, 466 F.Supp. 722, 725-728 (E.D.N.Y.1979).\n\nThere is no necessity for such close supervision. New York's executive and legislative departments have\ngenerally recognized their responsibilities towards clients at the Center; there is little reason to believe they will\nflout this court's decree. The striking improvements in the Center made under the leadership of the present\nDirector in just a few years as well as his obvious competence and integrity give high promise of compliance\nwithout outside supervision. To assist the Director in monitoring the decree and in making required reports to the\ncourt, the decree directs him to appoint a high level assistant to help him comply.\nA number of factors strongly suggest that the Director must be afforded maximum flexibility in fulfilling his\nobligations under the decree. Professional standards and practice are changing; theory is still in a state of flux.\nThe Director of Suffolk Developmental Center must lead a large professional staff with many specialties and\nprerogatives. He must train lay workers in new techniques and inspire them to do demanding and often\ndemeaning work with little financial reward. He must deal with unions and rigid state-wide labor agreements. He\nmust meet the demands of officials and bureaucratic regulations at the municipal, county, state and federal\nlevels. He must gain the confidence and support of families of clients. He must overcome the understandable\nreluctance of local residents who oppose community residences out of ignorance rather than malice. He must\ninduce many private agencies to provide services throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties. Moreover, he must\nconsider not only the needs of those at the Center, but the much larger group of retarded persons living with their\nfamilies who should be supported in their homes or who should go directly to community centers. Having lawyers\nand the court constantly looking over his shoulder is one burden that should be minimized. Cf. Arthur v. Nyquist,\n712 F.2d 809 at 812, 814 (2d Cir.1983) (reliance upon \"good faith\" of officials in charge of program and\n\"deference\" to them). Having been given the power and facilities he sought, there is no reason the Director of the\nCenter should not comply with the decree in all particulars.\nThe court retains jurisdiction to make further orders in enforcing the decree. It urges the parties to work with each\nother in a spirit of helpfulness in order to avoid the need for further litigation. The primary responsibility for\noperating the Suffolk Developmental Center and for caring for the welfare of its clients must rest with the state\nand its officials, not the courts. The Director has been given the maximum possible authority and aid to enable\nhim to do his constitutional and professional duty. He should be allowed to do his important and difficult work with\na minimum of interference from the law.\nB. Terms\n1. Defendants shall implement the annexed Plan; and\n1353 *1353 2. In order to advise plaintiffs, defendants and the Court as to defendants' progress with compliance and\nfailures to comply with the annexed Plan, defendants shall hire a reporting officer and one secretary forthwith.\nThe reporting officer shall be an appropriate professional in the field of Mental Retardation and Developmental\nDisabilities and shall regularly report to the Director of Suffolk Developmental Center and the defendants. The\nreporting officer shall issue written reports to the Court, with copies to counsel for plaintiffs and defendants on\nSeptember 1, 1983, and every April 1 and September 1 for the years 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. These written\nreports shall address defendants' compliance and failures to comply with each of the items set forth in the\nannexed Plan. The reporting officer shall be accessible to plaintiffs, but need not furnish plaintiffs with any written\nmaterials other than the biannual written reports specified herein, and\n3. The Court retains jurisdiction until further order.\nGOAL I: To Assure Proper Programming, Particularly for those Over the\n        Age of 21 Not Educated in the Public School System\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 OBJECTIVE                                              ACTIONS\n1.

Gen. of the State of New York (Robert Abrams, Atty. Gen. of the State\nof New York, Lawrence S. Kahn, Deputy Sol. Gen., New York City, of counsel), for defendants-appellees.\nBefore PRATT and ALTIMARI, Circuit Judges, and FRANK A. KAUFMAN, District Judge, United States District\nCourt for the District of Maryland, sitting by designation.\n246 *246 PER CURIAM:\nIn Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc., v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984), this court vacated the\ndistrict court's order of August 10, 1983, 572 F.Supp. 1300 (Weinstein, Chief Judge), and held that, while most of\nthat 1983 order might be supported by federal law, parts of it could not. Because, after the district court's order,\nthe United States Supreme Court had decided in Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), that the eleventh amendment bars a federal court from granting state law\nrelief in actions against state officials, we remanded for reconsideration so the district court could determine\nwhich portions of its 1983 order were supported by federal law.\nOn remand, when defendants informed the court that they would voluntarily implement the entire plan required by\nthe 1983 order, Judge Weinstein noted that \"[i]n light of the defendants' representation that they are now\nimplementing and will continue to implement the plan, the issues presented on remand are moot.\" 103 F.R.D.\n168, 169 (E.D.N.Y.1984). Contemplating that the state would comply with the requirements of the plan, but\nresponding to the plaintiffs' request for some means to enforce compliance with the plan, the district court stated,\n\"[i]f the defendants substantially depart from the implementation of the plan and conditions at the facility violate\nfederal law, plaintiffs may move to reinstate the case.\" Id.\n\nAlleging continued violations of federal law as well as departures from the plan, plaintiffs, on September 26,\n1986, moved to reinstate the case. Judge Weinstein denied the motion on the erroneous assumption that \"the\ncase [was] already in effect long closed\", and he granted plaintiffs sixty days in which to serve a complaint in a\n\"new action\", which he deemed to have been commenced by the filing of plaintiffs' motion. This was in error and\nan abuse of discretion. In light of the state's voluntary undertaking to carry out the entire plan embodied in the\n1983 order, whether required by state law or by federal law, or by neither, it was not improper for Judge Weinstein\nand the parties to defer consideration of the issues on remand since full compliance with the plan as offered by\nthe defendants would have rendered unnecessary the separation of federal from state law that we had required\nin our order of remand. Now that the defendants' compliance with the plan has been challenged, however, the\nissues on remand are no longer moot and the district court must comply with our remand order with a view\ntoward enforcing those portions of its 1983 order that under Pennhurst may be granted by a federal court.\nIt may be that the entire 1983 order can now be enforced against the state, including the portions based on state\nlaw. In this connection the district court should consider, with due regard to Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,\n473 U.S. 234, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985), whether the state has waived its eleventh amendment\nimmunity in this case. The state may have done so (1) when the defendants represented to the district court that\nthey would voluntarily implement the 1983 plan in full, or (2) when the assistant attorney general conceded at oral\nargument before this court that in the reinstated case, or even in a new case, the state would be bound to carry\nout that plan.\nWe therefore reverse and remand with a direction to the district court (1) to reinstate the case, (2) to determine\nwhether and to what extent the state has waived its eleventh amendment immunity in this case, and (3) to\nconduct such further proceedings as shall be appropriate, including, if necessary, a separation of the state and\nfederal claims, in order to secure for the plaintiff class the relief to which it is now entitled.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
