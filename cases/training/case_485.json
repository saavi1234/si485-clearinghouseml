The Ohio Department of Human Services (ODHS) and its director, and other agencies and officials were subsequently added as defendants.</p><p>Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. The District Court  (Judge Alvin I. Krenzler) granted defendants' motion in part and denied it in part.  Nicoletti v. Brown, 740 F.Supp. 1268 (N.D. Ohio 1987).  A Second Amended Complaint was subsequently filed and additional plaintiffs intervened in the action.  Additional claims were made regarding conditions at the Broadview and Warrensville Developmental Centers.</p><p>The PACER docket is incomplete and is missing blocks of entries.   As a result, we do not know what substantive case activity took place in 1988 and 1989.</p><p>According to the docket, on June 19, 1990, a settlement conference was held by the District Court (Judge Alvin I. Krenzler), at which time the case was resolved.  </p><p>On August 8, 1990, the District Court (Judge Alvin I. Krenzler) entered a Consent Order, which dissolved prior court orders.  The Consent Order directed the ODMR/DD defendants to comply with Medicaid ICF/MR standards at BDC and WDC.  It further ordered that prior to the transfer of any resident the ODMR/DD was to provide them with a post discharge plan.  The Court appointed Anthony DiNuzzo as Special Master. The Court later appointed Susan Arnoczky Ph.D., as a special advisor to the Court regarding the certification of Broadview and other issues relevant to the case.</p><p>On October 12 1993, the District Court entered an order dissolving and terminating the Consent Order of 8/8/90 and dismissing the action without prejudice.  The Docket notes that the Cleveland and Broadview Developmental Centers had been closed and that the Warrensville Developmental Center had been certified under the Medicaid program as an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "740 F.Supp. 1268 (1987)\nPhillip NICOLETTI, et al., Plaintiffs,\nv.\nRobert BROWN, et al., Defendants.\nNo. C87-1456.\nUnited States District Court, N.D. Ohio, E.D.\nOctober 29, 1987.\n1269 *1269 Walter J. Gerhardstein, David G. Latanick and Grant D. Shoub, Cloppert, Portman, Sauter, Latanick &\nFoley, Columbus, Ohio, for plaintiffs.\nDavid J. Kovach, Office of the Atty. Gen., Cleveland, Ohio, for Robert Brown.\nShane Egan, Ohio Legal Rights, Columbus, Ohio, for Francis Johnson.\nMEMORANDUM OF OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND\nDENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS\nKRENZLER, District Judge.\n[1]\nThis is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988. The plaintiffs  are\ninvoluntarily committed mentally retarded persons residing at the Cleveland Developmental Center (\"CDC\"), a\nstate operated institution for the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled. Named as defendants are\nRobert Brown, Director of the Ohio Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities\n1270 (\"ODMRDD\"),[2] Patrick Rafter, Chief of *1270 the Division of Developmental Centers, and Gregory Darling,\nSuperintendent of CDC.\nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs allege that they have each been determined to be eligible for Medicaid\nintermediate care services for the mentally retarded (\"ICF/MR\" services). They also allege that they, in fact,\nreceived such services until November of 1986, at which time CDC lost its certification as an ICF/MR facility\nbecause defendant failed to maintain CDC in accordance with the standards established by Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Act (\"Title XIX\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq. (Supp. 1987). Plaintiffs contend that, since that time, they\nhave merely been \"warehoused\" at CDC, an environment which they and various mental health experts have\ncharacterized as \"hazardous\" and \"dangerous.\" Recently, plaintiffs allege, they have been informed that\noperations at CDC will be phased down over the next year; that approximately twenty (20) members of the CDC\nstaff will be laid off, thereby further diminishing the level of care and services available to CDC residents; and that\nCDC residents will be relocated to other non-Medicaid certified facilities outside Cuyahoga County. Plaintiffs\ncontend that such relocation will make it difficult for them to maintain contact with and receive visits from their\nfamilies and loved ones, and that despite the transfers, they still will not be placed in Medicaid certified facilities.\nUpon receipt of notice of the impending phase down of CDC and the threatened transfer of CDC residents,\nplaintiffs initiated this suit.\nAlthough the complaint in this case is far from a model of draftsmanship, it appears to the Court that plaintiffs\nattempt to set forth four separate, yet somewhat interrelated, claims for relief. First, plaintiffs contend that\ndefendants have violated their rights under the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 6000, et seq. (Supp.1987). Second, they contend that their rights under the Medicaid provisions of Title\nXIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq., have been violated. Third, plaintiffs allege that the\nconditions at CDC violate their fourteenth amendment due process rights to minimally adequate training, safety,\nand freedom from undue restraint as articulated in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73\nL.Ed.2d 28 (1982). Finally, plaintiffs allege that they have a protected property interest in being housed in an\n\ninstitution that meets the standards of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and that they have been\nunconstitutionally deprived of this property interest.\nIn addition to requesting a declaratory judgment declaring that their rights under the foregoing statutory and\nconstitutional provisions have been violated, plaintiffs also seek an injunction ordering that the defendants: (a)\nimmediately improve the conditions at CDC so that CDC residents can be assured of their constitutionally\nprotected liberty interests; (b) immediately seek Medicaid re-certification of the CDC; (c) allow residents to\nchoose placement in another appropriate Medicaid-certified facility; (d) cease relocating Medicaid/ICF-eligible\nresidents to non-Medicaid/ICF-certified facilities; and (e) cease laying off staff members at the CDC until the\nresident's rights can be guaranteed. Additionally, plaintiffs seek attorney fees and costs.\nFollowing an initial hearing, the Court granted plaintiffs a temporary restraining order pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65\n(b). Subsequently, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action, pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing\nthat plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In deciding such motions, the Court\nmust \"take as true the material facts alleged\" in the complaint, Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital,\n1271 425 *1271 U.S. 738, 740, 96 S.Ct. 1848, 1850, 48 L.Ed.2d 338 (1976), and may dismiss an action only when it\nappears \"beyond doubt that the plaintiff[s] can prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim which would entitle\n[them] to relief.\" Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); Conley v.\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). For the following reasons, defendants'\nmotion to dismiss is hereby granted in part and denied in part. Each of the plaintiffs' four theories will be\nconsidered separately.\nI.\nPlaintiffs' first claim for relief is predicated upon the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of\n[3]\n1975 (\"Disabled Assistance Act\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 6000, et seq. (Supp.1987).  Plaintiffs contend that the Disabled\nAssistance Act gives them an entitlement to a \"system to advance the rights of persons with developmental\n[4]\ndisabilities\" and a right to \"receiv[e] program services under an individual habilitation plan.\"  They contend that\nthese rights have been violated by the defendants, and request this Court to issue appropriate declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, ordering the defendants to implement a plan that will assure that all residents of CDC \"receive\nappropriate program services under an individual habilitation plan and have their rights as residents of CDC and\nas citizens advanced by defendants.\"\nThe defendants, in their motion to dismiss, argue that the Disabled Assistance Act does not provide the plaintiffs\nwith any substantive rights upon which to base this action. The basis of defendants' argument is that the \"rights\"\nconferred by the Disabled Assistance Act are conditioned upon the state's acceptance of funds distributed under\nthe Act. Additionally, the defendants argue that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Pennhurst State\nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981) (\"Pennhurst I\"), holding\n[5]\nthat 42 U.S.C. § 6009  did not confer substantive rights upon the mentally retarded, is controlling in this case.\nThe defendants also contend that the only relief available under the Disabled Assistance Act is the termination of\nfederal funds, which was not requested by the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs, in their memorandum in opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss, respond that the holding in\nPennhurst I covered only a narrow issue regarding the Disabled Assistance Act and does not preclude their\nclaims. The plaintiffs additionally assert that the Disabled Assistance Act creates substantive rights which are\n[6]\nenforceable through a private cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n1272 *1272 For the reasons provided below, the Court denies the defendants' motion to dismiss the claim brought\nunder the Disabled Assistance Act.\nThe Disabled Assistance Act establishes \"a federal-state program whereby the Federal Government provides\nfinancial assistance to ... participating States to aid them in creating programs to care for and treat the\ndevelopmentally disabled.\" Pennhurst I, 451 U.S. at 11, 101 S.Ct. at 1536. Congress, in 42 U.S.C. § 6000(b)(1),\nstates the purpose of the Disabled Assistance Act as being:\n\n... to assist States to (A) assure that persons with developmental disabilities receive the care,\ntreatment, and other services necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential\nthrough increased independence, productivity, and integration into the community, and (B)\nestablish and operate a system which coordinates, monitors, plans, and evaluates services which\nensures the protection of the legal and human rights of persons with developmental disabilities.\nAdditionally, in 42 U.S.C. § 6000(b)(2), Congress states that the \"... specific purposes of this chapter are 00 (A) to\n97\nassist in the provision of comprehensive services to persons with developmental disabilities, ... [and] (B) to assist\nStates in appropriate planning activities; ....\"\nThe provisions of the Disabled Assistance Act consist of several requirements which the states must meet in\norder to qualify for the funds available under this Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 6008 (affirmative action program for the\nemployment of handicapped persons, a condition of receipt of funds). Other provisions describe the\nadministrative aspects of the Disabled Assistance Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 6002 (fiscal percentages provided by the\nfederal government). Additionally, at least one provision of the Disabled Assistance Act has been held to be\nnothing more than words of encouragement from Congress, designed merely to \"nudge\" the states in the\npreferred direction. See Pennhurst I, 451 U.S. at 20, 101 S.Ct. at 1541 (interpreting congressional findings\nrespecting rights of developmentally disabled as mere precatory language).\nThe specific rights claimed by the plaintiffs under the Disabled Assistance Act are found in 42 U.S.C. §§ 6023 and\n6042 which provide as follows:\n§ 6023. Habilitation Plans\n* * * * * *\n[[7]]\nThe Secretary shall require as a condition to a State's receiving an allotment under this\nsubchapter that the State provide the Secretary satisfactory assurances that each program\n(including programs of any agency, facility, or project) which receives funds from the State's\nallotment under this subchapter (1) has in effect for each developmentally disabled person who\nreceives services from or under the program a habilitation plan meeting the requirements of\nsubsection (b)\n....\n§ 6042. System requirement\n* * * * * *\nIn order for a State to receive an allotment under subchapter II of this chapter 00\n97\n(1) the State must have in effect a system to protect and advocate the rights of persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities; ....\n(Emphasis added.)\nTo state a cause of action under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that his \"rights as secured under federal laws\"\n1273 have been violated by actions \"under color of law.\" See 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1982). The issue before *1273 this\n[8]\nCourt is whether the plaintiffs have enforceable rights under §§ 6023 and 6042 of the Disabled Assistance Act.\nThe defendants argue that the Supreme Court's holding in Pennhurst I is controlling in the present action. The\nCourt, however, strongly disagrees. The Supreme Court, in Pennhurst I, decided only that the mentally retarded\nhave no rights under § 6009 of the Disabled Assistance Act. Pennhurst I expressly declined to reach the issues\nthat are presently before this Court. Id.,451 U.S. at 28, 101 S.Ct. at 1545. Therefore, the Court must decide\nwhether the plaintiffs have stated a cause of action under the Disabled Assistance Act.\n\nIn Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980), the Supreme Court held that a cause\nof action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 exists to enforce rights secured by the laws of the United States. Id. at 8, 100\nS.Ct. at 2506. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, no cause of action exists where the statute\ndoes not create enforceable rights. See, e.g., Pennhurst I, 451 U.S. at 18, 101 S.Ct. at 1540. Second, in \nMiddlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association, 453 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69\nL.Ed.2d 435 (1981), the Court found congressional intent to foreclose a private cause of action pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 through the creation of a separate remedial scheme developed under the Acts in question. Id. at\n14, 101 S.Ct. at 2623.\nThe first question which must be addressed, therefore, is whether §§ 6023 and 6042 of the Disabled Assistance\nAct create enforceable rights for the plaintiffs in this action. The key to determining this issue is legislative intent.\n[9]\nMiddlesex, 453 U.S. at 13, 101 S.Ct. at 2622.\nIn determining the legislature's intent in enacting the Disabled Assistance Act the Court must first look to whether\nthe plaintiffs are \"of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted....\" Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78,\n95 S.Ct. 2080, 2087, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975). See also Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 689, 99\nS.Ct. 1946, 1953, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The Disabled Assistance Act expressly provides that its \"overall\npurpose\" is \"to assist States to ... assure that persons with developmental disabilities receive the care, treatment,\nand other services necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential....\" 42 U.S.C. § 6000(b)(1). See\nalso H.R.Rep. No. 473, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 42, reprinted in 1975 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 919, 961 (\"The\nrights enumerated in the Disabled Assistance Act are generally included ... in recognition ... that the\ndevelopmentally disabled, particularly those who have the misfortune to require institutionalization have a right to\nreceive appropriate treatment for the conditions for which they are institutionalized....\"); S.Rep. No. 493, 98th\nCong., 2d Sess. 10, reprinted in 1984 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 4334, 4343. (\"The ... bill retains as the overall\n1274 purpose of the program the provision, coordination, planning and monitoring of services for persons with *1274\ndevelopmental disabilities in order to enable such persons to reach their maximum potential.\") Thus, it is\napparent that if plaintiffs are \"persons with developmental disabilities,\" they are, in the words of Cort v. Ash, \"of\nthe class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted.\" Id.422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2087-2088. The term\n\"developmental disability\" is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 6001(7) as follows:\nThe term \"developmental disability\" means a severe, chronic disability of a person which 00\n97\n(A) is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical\nimpairments;\n(B) is manifested before the person attains age twenty-two;\n(C) is likely to continue indefinitely;\n(D) results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life\nactivity: (i) self-care (ii) receptive and expressive language (iii) learning (iv) mobility (v) self-\ndirection (vi) capacity for independent living and (vii) economic self-sufficiency; and\n(E) reflects the person's need for a combination and sequence of special interdisciplinary or\ngeneric care, treatment, or other services which are of lifelong or extended duration and are\nindividually planned and coordinated.\nThe defendants do not contest that plaintiffs fit within this definition. The Court therefore finds that plaintiffs are of\nthe class to which Congress intended to bestow benefits in enacting the Disabled Assistance Act.\nBefore determining, however, that the plaintiffs were given rights under the Disabled Assistance Act, the Court\nmust look to see if the language of the statute is cast in \"mandatory terms.\" See Pennhurst I, 451 U.S. at 27, 101\nS.Ct. at 1545. See also Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 433-435,\n107 S.Ct. 766, 775-776, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).\n\nIn Pennhurst I, the Supreme Court described a state's acceptance of funds under the Disabled Assistance Act as\nbeing contractual in nature. See id.,451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. at 1539-1540. (\"The legitimacy of Congress'\nspending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the `contract.'\")\nThe contractual nature of the receipt of funds under the Disabled Assistance Act forces the Court to look at\nwhether the provisions of the Act upon which the plaintiffs base their cause of action are specifically enumerated\nas requirements for the receipt of funds. In other words, if and when the State of Ohio chose to receive funds\nunder the Act, was there sufficient notice of the requirements for the State of Ohio to know \"what is expected of\nit.\" Pennhurst I, id.\nThe first provision on which the plaintiffs base their claim, 42 U.S.C. § 6042, states in part that a \"State must have\nin effect a system to protect and advocate the rights of persons with developmental disabilities.\" (Emphasis\nadded.) This provision, and the legislative history behind this provision, demonstrate conclusively that if a State\naccepts funds under the Disabled Assistance Act, it must comply with this provision. See S.Rep. 493, 98th Cong.,\n2d Sess. 28, reprinted in 1984 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 4334, 4361. (\"The Committee views State Protection\nand Advocacy systems ... to be of critical importance in an expanding effort by the congress to assure disabled\npersons both protection of their rights under law and full access to federally funded programs.\")\nThis Court, therefore, finds on the basis of both the plain language of the statute, and the legislative history\nbehind 42 U.S.C. § 6042, that the protection and advocacy system requirement is clearly mandatory upon any\nstate accepting funds under the Disabled Assistance Act. Accordingly, looking at the intent of Congress through\nthe language of the statute and through the legislative history, this Court finds that the plaintiffs do have a right to\na protection and advocacy system under 42 U.S.C. § 6042.\nThe second provision upon which the plaintiffs base their claims is located in 42 U.S.C. § 6023 which states, in\n1275 part, that the \"Secretary shall require as a condition\" *1275 of the receipt of federal funds under the Disabled\nAssistance Act that the state make \"satisfactory assurances that each program which receives funds (1) has in\neffect for each developmentally disabled person who receives services from or under the program a habilitation\nplan....\"\nA cursory reading of 42 U.S.C. § 6023 might indicate that an assurance given to the Secretary is not a sufficient\nindication by Congress to give the plaintiffs a right to an individual habilitation plan. See, e.g., Pennhurst I, 451\nU.S. at 28, 101 S.Ct. at 1545. (\"It is at least an open question whether an individual's interest in having a State\nprovide those `assurances' is a `right secured' by the laws of the United States within the meaning of § 1983.\") \nCf. id.,451 U.S. at 33, 101 S.Ct. at 1548 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (\"That private parties, the intended\nbeneficiaries of the Act, should have the power to enforce the modest legal content of [§ 6022] would not be an\nunusual application of our precedents, even for a legislative scheme that involves federal regulatory supervision\nof state operations.\").\nThe assurances given to the Secretary with respect to the individual habilitation plans are to be included in the\n\"state plan\" which a state must submit to the Secretary prior to the receipt of federal funds. 42 U.S.C. § 6022. \nSee also 45 C.F.R. § 1386.30(a) and (d). (§ 1386.30(a): \"In order to receive Federal financial assistance under\nthis subpart, ... States must prepare, submit and have in effect a State plan ...; § 1386.30(d): \"The State plan\nmust contain assurances that: ... (2) the State meets the requirements regarding individual habilitation plans....\")\nIn addition to the language of the specific statutory provisions, which requires a State to make assurances prior to\n[10]\nthe receipt of federal funds,  the Court notes that noncompliance by a state with its state plan is cause for the\n[11]\nrevocation of federal funds.  Therefore, it is clear that a State which chooses to accept funds under the\nDisabled Assistance Act is required to furnish the Secretary assurances that it is providing individual habilitation\nplans to recipients of the federal funds.\nThe question of whether a right may be derived from an \"assurance\" given to the Secretary is also answered in\nthe affirmative by this Court. First, it is a general rule in statutory construction that a court must interpret the\nlanguage of a statute so as not to \"render certain provisions superfluous or insignificant.\" Woodfork v. Marine\nCooks & Stewards, 642 F.2d 966, 970-71 (5th Cir.1981) (citing Zeigler Coal Co. v. Kleppe, 536 F.2d 398, 406\n(D.C.Cir.1976)). See also South Corp. v. United States, 690 F.2d 1368, 1374 (Fed.Cir.1982) (a court should not\n\nconstrue a statute in a way which would impute a useless act to Congress). In the present matter, unless the\nCourt construes the creation of the individual habilitation plans as a requirement for the receipt of federal funds\nunder the Disabled Assistance Act, the dictates of Congress would certainly be rendered \"superfluous\" and\n\"insignificant.\" The granting of assurances to the Secretary by the State of Ohio in the state plan means\nabsolutely nothing unless those assurances are based in fact. Therefore, the Court holds that the receipt of funds\nunder the Disabled Assistance Act is conditioned upon the state creating individual habilitation plans for those\nrecipients of funds under the Disabled Assistance Act. Accordingly, looking at the intent of the legislature, through\nthe plain language of the statute, and through the regulations as enacted pursuant to the Secretary's authority\n1276 under *1276 the Act,[12] the Court finds that the plaintiffs do have a right to an individual habilitation plan under\nthe Disabled Assistance Act.\nHowever, the findings made by this Court that the plaintiffs have rights under the Disabled Assistance Act do not\nend the inquiry as to whether the plaintiffs have stated a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The next issue\nwhich must be addressed is whether 42 U.S.C. § 1983 can be utilized to enforce these rights.\nIn determining whether the plaintiffs have an enforceable right to the provisions cited in the Disabled Assistance\nAct, this Court must look to the legislative intent to create such a remedy. Middlesex, 453 U.S. at 13, 101 S.Ct. at\n2622. This analysis must begin with the general proposition that a court should \"not lightly conclude that\nCongress intended to preclude reliance on § 1983 as a remedy for the deprivation of a federally secured right.\" \nWright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 423-424, 107 S.Ct. 766,\n770-771, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987) (quoting Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1012, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 3468, 82\nL.Ed.2d 746 (1984)). The burden of showing that there is not a remedy to enforce a \"right\" under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 is on the state actor. Wright, 479 U.S. 418 at 423-424, 107 S.Ct. 766 at 770-771. (\"... if there is a state\ndeprivation of a `right' secured by a federal statute, § 1983 provides a remedial cause of action unless the state\nactor demonstrates by express provision or other specific evidence from the statute itself that Congress intended\nto foreclose such private enforcement.\")\nIn the present matter, the Court, upon reviewing the Disabled Assistance Act, does not find any express provision\nwhich would preclude a cause of action by the plaintiffs to enforce their legal rights. Therefore, the Court must\nlook to any \"specific evidence\" which is contained within the statute or legislative history which would indicate a\ncongressional intent to foreclose a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim to enforce the provisions of the Disabled Assistance\nAct.\nThe issue of how to determine congressional intent to foreclose a private remedy under section 1983 is not a new\none for the courts. In Middlesex, 453 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981), the Court found that by\nestablishing a statutory scheme in which aggrieved persons could enforce their rights under the Water Pollution\nAct, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251, et seq., and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. §§\n[13]\n1401, et seq., Congress had foreclosed a separate cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Middlesex, 453\nU.S. at 14, 101 S.Ct. at 2623.\nMore recently, in Wright, 479 U.S. 418 at 423-424, 107 S.Ct. 766 at 770-771, the issue decided was whether low-\nincome housing tenants had a private cause of action to enforce the rental provisions of the Brooke Amendment\nto the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § 1437a (\"Brooke Amendment\"), and the regulations of the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). After finding that the plaintiffs had a \"right\" under the provisions of the\n[14]\nBrooke Amendment,  the Court analyzed whether Congress had intended that the provisions of the Act be\nenforceable only by HUD, as held by the lower court. See Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing\n1277 Authority, 771 F.2d 833, 837 (4th Cir. 1985) (\"HUD alone may, as quasi trustee, *1277 take legal action, for the\nright is explicitly tailored not to allow the beneficiaries, the low cost housing tenants, to do so\").\nThe Supreme Court of the United States found that the defendant had failed to \"overcome its burden of showing\nthat `the remedial devices provided in [the Housing Act] are sufficiently comprehensive ... to demonstrate\ncongressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under § 1983.'\" Wright, 479 U.S. 418 at 423-424, 107 S.Ct.\n766 at 770-771. The Court, in reaching this determination, looked at both the negative and the positive aspects of\ncongressional intent. The Court found that the Brooke Amendment and its legislative history was \"devoid of any\nexpress indication that exclusive enforcement authority was vested in HUD....\" Id. Additionally, the Court found\n\nthat there was a positive representation in both congressional and HUD actions indicating that enforcement\nauthority was not centralized, and that a private right of action was anticipated by Congress.\nThe Supreme Court, in analyzing the remedial scheme provided under the Housing Act and the Brooke\nAmendment, noted that HUD officials had represented to Congress during hearings that tenants had the right to\nenforce the Brooke Amendment in federal court and that a formal grievance procedure for the resolution of tenant\ndisputes had been created by HUD. Id. at 426-427, 107 S.Ct. at 772-773. Additionally, the Court found pertinent\nthe fact that the only private remedy provided for in the Housing Act itself was a local grievance procedure. Id. at\n426-432, 107 S.Ct. at 772-775.\nThe Court rejected the Court of Appeals' contention that \"HUD's authority to audit, enforce annual contributions\ncontracts, and cut off federal funds\" was sufficient to indicate that there was congressional intention to foreclose\nremedies under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. at 426-427, 107 S.Ct. at 772-773. The Court found that HUD's audits every\neight years of the many Public Housing Authorities was insufficient to demonstrate exclusive enforcement\nauthority being vested in HUD. Id. Additionally, the Court noted that the HUD regulations did not provide any\nformal mechanism for tenants to bring violations of the regulations to the attention of the HUD officials. Id.\nThe Supreme Court, after looking at all of the evidence, concluded that there was no specific evidence that\nCongress intended to foreclose a private cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Wright, 479 U.S. 418 at\n430-432, 107 S.Ct. 766 at 774-775.\nIn the present matter, this Court, following a review of all of the procedures for enforcement of the provisions of\nthe Disabled Assistance Act created by Congress and the Secretary, and viewing them in light of the presumption\nthat rights created under federal statutes are enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, holds that the plaintiffs may\nbring their cause of action under the Disabled Assistance Act, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nFirst, although the only enforcement provision explicitly provided for in the Disabled Assistance Act is action by\nthe Secretary, see 42 U.S.C. § 6022(c) (Secretary may disapprove State plan following reasonable notice and\nopportunity for a hearing), this is not dispositive of the issue of enforceability by private citizens. Wright, 479 U.S.\n418 at 423-424, 107 S.Ct. 766 at 770-771.\nFurthermore, a review of the other indicia of congressional intent does not overcome the presumption in favor of\nthe creation of an enforceable right under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Indeed, the regulations affirmatively permit \"injured\nparties\" to become parties in a state plan revocation hearing, 45 C.F.R. § 386.94(b)(1). Upon the Secretary's\ndisapproval of a state plan or amendments to a state plan, there are precise procedures which must be followed\nby the Secretary. See 45 C.F.R. §§ 1386.80-1386.112. A hearing must be held to provide the state a forum to\ndefend its state plan. 45 C.F.R. § 1386.81. At this hearing, other parties may be allowed to participate. Thus, 45\nC.F.R. § 1386.94(b)(1) provides that \"[o]ther individuals or groups may be recognized as parties if the issues to\n1278 be considered at the hearing have caused them injury and their interests are relevant *1278 to the issues in the\nhearing.\" The Court notes that the regulations do not simply give the developmentally disabled the right to be\nheard or to participate in the hearings, but to actually be \"recognized as parties.\"\nAdditionally, as in Wright, the procedures established by the Secretary to review the state plan and the advocacy\nsystem, are not sufficient to comprehensively guarantee state compliance. Thus, pursuant to 45 C.F.R. § 1386.30\n(d) \"[t]he State plan must be reviewed [by the Secretary] at least once every three years,\" but need not be\nreviewed by the Secretary more often than once every three years. Additionally, as in Wright, there is no\nmechanism by which injured parties can bring violations to the attention of the Secretary. Therefore, unless the\nbeneficiaries of the plan are afforded a private right of action to enforce it, a state could, conceivably, violate its\nown plan with impunity for three years.\nWith one possible exception the legislative history of the Disabled Assistance Act appears to be devoid of any\ncongressional statements either for or against the creation of a private cause of action. That one exception is the\nfollowing statement made in discussing the bill of rights provisions of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6009:\nThese rights are generally included ... in recognition ... that the developmentally disabled,\nparticularly those who have the misfortune to require institutionalization have a right to receive\n\nappropriate treatment for the conditions for which they are institutionalized and that this right\nshould be protected and assured by the Congress and the courts. (Emphasis added.)\nH.R.Rep. No. 473, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 42, reprinted in 1975 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad. News 919, 961. Any\ncontention that Congress intended to preclude reliance upon the courts to enforce the state plan and advocacy\nsystem is refuted by this statement in the legislative history of the Act.\nThe defendants, in their motion to dismiss, argue that the state of Ohio has the option of choosing to receive\nfederal funds under the Disabled Assistance Act, and thus the plaintiffs do not have the right to bring this action if\nthe state chooses not to meet the requirements of the Act. However, as was stated previously in Wright, 479 U.S.\n418 at 423-424, 107 S.Ct. 766 at 770-771, the ability of the Secretary to cut off funds does not preclude a private\ncause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nPresently, this Court does not have sufficient information to determine whether the State of Ohio is presently\nreceiving funds under the Disabled Assistance Act; and if the State is receiving funds, to which programs these\nfunds are alloted. Although this defect in the pleadings and motions is not to be ignored by a court, neither should\nsuch a technical defect be the basis for a decision on the merits. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181, 83\nS.Ct. 227, 229, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). (\"It is too late in the day and entirely contrary to the spirit of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure for decisions on the merits to be avoided on the basis of such mere technicalities.\")\nAdditionally, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs, even if they do have a right to bring this cause of action,\nhave not requested a proper remedy. The plaintiffs have requested that this Court declare the State of Ohio in\nviolation of the Disabled Assistance Act, and to grant an injunction ordering the state to meet the requirements as\nprovided under the Disabled Assistance Act. However, this argument is not appropriate for a motion to dismiss.\nThe inclusion in a complaint of an improper remedy does not require the dismissal of a meritorious claim. See \nHolt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 65, 99 S.Ct. 383, 387, 58 L.Ed.2d 292 (1978).\nLooking at the statutory language, the legislative history, and applying settled principles of statutory interpretation,\nthe Court finds that the defendants have failed to overcome the \"burden of showing that `the remedial devices\nprovided in [the Disabled Assistance Act] are sufficiently comprehensive ... to demonstrate congressional intent to\n1279 preclude the remedy of suits under § 1983.\" Wright, 479 U.S. at 423-424, *1279 107 S.Ct. at 770-771, 93 L.Ed.2d\nat 789 (1987).\nFor the foregoing reasons the Court concludes that the plaintiffs' complaint states a claim for relief under the\nDisabled Assistance Act.\nII.\nPlaintiffs' second theory for relief is predicated upon the Medicaid provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq. The gist of plaintiffs' claim appears to be that by allowing CDC to lose its\ncertification as a Medicaid certified facility, defendants have deprived plaintiffs of various rights under 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1396, et seq. Plaintiffs contend that the rights which accrue to them under § 1396 and its implementing\nregulations are (a) the right to receive \"active treatment,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d) and 42 C.F.R. § 435.1009; (b) the\nright to choose to be placed in an appropriate Medicaid facility, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23) and 42 C.F.R. § 431.51;\nand (c) the right to notice and a hearing prior to termination of their Medicaid services, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3)\nand 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.200, et seq.\nVirtually indistinguishable claims were rejected by the Supreme Court in O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center,\n447 U.S. 773, 100 S.Ct. 2467, 65 L.Ed.2d 506 (1980), in which the Supreme Court held that 42 U.S.C. § 1396\ndoes not create substantive rights in favor of Medicaid recipients. Id. at 786, 100 S.Ct. at 2475. O'Bannon\nteaches that:\nWhether viewed singly or in combination, the Medicaid provisions relied upon by the Court of\nAppeals do not confer a right to continued residence in the home of one's choice. Title 42 U.S.C. §\n1396a(a)(23) (1976 ed. Supp. II) gives recipients the right to choose among a range of qualified\nproviders, without government interference. By implication, it also confers an absolute right to be\n\nfree from government interference with the choice to remain in a home that continues to be\nqualified. But it clearly does not confer a right on a recipient to enter an unqualified home and\ndemand a hearing to certify it, nor does it confer a right on a recipient to continue to receive\nbenefits for care in a home that has been decertified. Second, although the regulations do protect\npatients by limiting the circumstances under which a home may transfer or discharge a Medicaid\nrecipient, they do not purport to limit the Government's right to make a transfer necessary by\ndecertifying a facility. Finally, since decertification does not reduce or terminate a patient's financial\nassistance, but merely requires him to use it for care at a different facility, regulations granting\nrecipients the right to a hearing prior to a reduction in financial benefits are irrelevant.\nId. at 785-86, 100 S.Ct. at 2475-76 (emphasis in original). In light of the foregoing, this Court is constrained to\nconclude that § 1396 does not, by itself, create rights which may be sued upon by plaintiffs as Medicaid\nrecipients and, hence, plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq.\nIn reaching this conclusion, this Court has not overlooked plaintiffs' attempt to distinguish this case from \nO'Bannon. In essence, plaintiffs argue that, in O'Bannon, the Medicaid recipients claimed that they were entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the decertification decision before certification was revoked. The instant\nplaintiffs contend that their claim in this case is different, in that they are not seeking to sue the federal or state\nagencies who decertified CDC. Rather, plaintiffs argue, this is a suit against the state officials in charge of the\nOhio Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities who allegedly allowed CDC to become\ndecertified. The Court finds this to be a distinction without merit.\nO'Bannon clearly stands for the proposition that 42 U.S.C. § 1396 does not create substantive rights which may\nbe enforced by Medicaid recipients. Although O'Bannon did state in dictum that the Medicaid-eligible nursing\nhome residents who lost their Medicaid benefits as a result of the nursing home's failure to maintain its Medicaid\n1280 certification \"might have a claim *1280 against the nursing home for damages,\" id. at 787, 100 S.Ct. at 2476, the\nCourt hastened to point out that \"[t]his would, of course, depend on the contract between the patients and the\nnursing home, if any, and the provisions of the applicable law.\" Id., at 787 n. 20, 100 S.Ct. at 2476 n. 20. Thus, to\nthe extent that Medicaid recipients do have a cause of action against the provider of Medicaid services for its\nfailure to maintain Medicaid certification, that cause of action arises by way of contract or state law, not under the\nfederal statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396. In this case, plaintiffs have alluded to no contract between themselves and\ndefendants whose terms were breached. They only cite the federal statutory provisions of the Social Security Act,\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq. Under O'Bannon, a claim predicated upon 42 U.S.C. § 1396 simpliciter will not lie.\nIII.\nFor their third claim, plaintiffs allege that defendants have:\nallowed plaintiffs and all other residents of CDC to live in ... [a] hazardous and dangerous\n[environment] ... characterized by a significant number of injuries and circumstances which\ncompromise client safety, and further characterized as an environment where residents' freedom\nof movement is restricted due to lack of training for staff and residents....\nPlaintiffs contend that these circumstances violate their liberty interests under the due process clause of the\nfourteenth amendment.\nIn Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), the Supreme Court held that an\ninvoluntarily committed retarded person has constitutionally protected liberty interests, under the due process\nclause of the fourteenth amendment, to reasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable\nbodily restraint, and such minimally adequate training as reasonably may be required by these interests. Id. at\n319, 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2459, 2462. These interests, however, are not absolute. Id. at 319-20, 102 S.Ct. at\n2459-60. To the contrary, the Court specifically noted that:\nIn operating an institution [for the mentally retarded] there are occasions in which it is necessary\nfor the State to restrain the movement of residents 00 for example, to protect them as well as\n97\n\nothers from violence. Similar restraints may also be appropriate in a training program. And an\ninstitution cannot protect its residents from all danger of violence if it is to permit them to have any\nfreedom of movement. The question then is not simply whether a liberty interest has been\ninfringed but whether the extent or nature of the restraint or lack of absolute safety is such as to\nviolate due process.\nId. at 320, 102 S.Ct. at 2460. (Footnote omitted.)\nIn making this determination, the Court must balance \"the individual's liberty interest against the State's asserted\nreasons for restraining individual liberty.\" Id. at 320, 102 S.Ct. at 2460. Moreover, Youngberg admonishes that\n\"this balancing cannot be left to the unguided discretion of a judge or jury.\" Id. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. Thus, a\njudge called upon to decide whether a particular curtailment of liberty is reasonable or unreasonable under the\ncircumstances \"must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional\" who prescribed the\nrestraint. Id. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. The Court, in Youngberg, concluded that:\nthe proper balance between the legitimate interests of the State and the rights of the involuntarily\ncommitted to reasonable conditions of freedom and from unreasonable restraints \"... only requires\nthat the courts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised. It is not appropriate\nfor the courts to specify which of several professionally acceptable choices should have been\nmade.\"\nId. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461 (quoting Romeo v. Youngberg, 644 F.2d 147, 178 (3d Cir.1980) (Seitz, J.,\nconcurring)).\n1281 The instant defendants, in their motion to dismiss, contend that plaintiffs have *1281 failed to allege conduct\nestablishing a violation of their substantive due process rights. The Court does not agree. To the contrary,\nplaintiffs' complaint alleges several specific occurrences which, if true, would indicate a total lack of judgment,\nprofessional or otherwise, on the part of defendants. For example, the complaint alleges that plaintiff Phillip\nNicoletti, a 46-year-old retarded adult, was permitted to stray from the institution's grounds and wander the public\nstreets without staff members of the CDC being aware of his absence; that plaintiff Frank Koniecdynski, a 65-\nyear-old male resident was allowed to fall through a third-floor window in one of the residential cottages at CDC\nand has also been permitted to wander unnoticed from the institution's grounds; and that plaintiff Donna Marie\nHorvath, a 51-year-old female, sustained a broken hip while residing at CDC. Additionally, plaintiffs' complaint\nquotes extensively from various studies that have been made of the conditions at CDC and other developmental\ncenters in Cuyahoga County by experts in the field such as the National Assault Prevention Center and the\nUniversity of North Carolina School of Medicine. These studies, which were commissioned by defendants\nthemselves, variously characterize the conditions at CDC as \"dangerous\" and \"hazardous\" due to a \"significant\namount of injuries and circumstances ... which compromise the safety of residents.\" Construed, as they must be,\nin the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 125-26, 95 S.Ct. 1524, 1531, 44\nL.Ed.2d 15 (1975), these allegations indicate that there has been a total failure on the part of defendants to\nexercise professional judgment where plaintiffs are concerned. The Court concludes, therefore, that plaintiffs'\ncomplaint states a claim for relief under the standards articulated in Youngberg.\nIV.\nPlaintiffs' final argument is that the complaint states a claim under § 5123.16 of the Ohio Revised Code and the\ndue process clause of the fourteenth amendment. Section 5123.16 requires institutions under the control of the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities to be in substantial compliance with the\nstandards set forth under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq. Plaintiffs argue that §\n5123.16 creates a property interest which triggers due process protections, and that defendants' actions in\npermitting the Cleveland Developmental Center (CDC) to become decertified as a Medicaid ICF/MR facility\ndeprived them of this property interest without due process.\nIn order to state a claim for relief under the due process clause, plaintiffs' complaint must allege \"both\ngovernmental action and the deprivation of a `life, liberty, or property' interest....\" Banks v. Block, 700 F.2d 292,\n\n295 (6th Cir.1983). There can be no dispute that plaintiffs' complaint satisfies the governmental action\nrequirement. The complaint alleges that plaintiffs have been deprived of various benefits by state officials acting\nunder color of law. This is a sufficient allegation of governmental action. Id. at 295. The critical question,\ntherefore, is whether the benefits referred to by plaintiffs constitute a liberty or property interest.\nIn searching for the answer to this question, the Supreme Court's decision in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S.\n564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), is perhaps the most didactic. Roth teaches that there is no precise\ndefinition of \"liberty\" or \"property\" because these terms \"are among the [g]reat [constitutional] concepts ...\npurposefully left to gather meaning from experience.\" Id. at 571, 92 S.Ct. at 2705-2706. See also, Banks v. Block,\n700 F.2d at 295-96. Both concepts have been broadly defined over the course of the Supreme Court's decisions.\nFor example, in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), liberty was\ndefined to include:\nnot merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage\nin any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home\n1282 and bring up children, to worship God *1282 according to the dictates of his own conscience, and\ngenerally to enjoy those privileges long recognized ... as essential to the orderly pursuit of\nhappiness by free men.\nThis list is far from exhaustive and, in more recent times, a variety of statutorily created rights have been held to\nbe protected liberty interests. See, e.g., Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60\nL.Ed.2d 668 (1979) (state statute establishing a parole system creates a protected liberty interest); Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (liberty interest created by statute awarding\nprisoners time off from their sentences for good behavior).\nProperty has also been defined broadly. For due process purposes, property encompasses interests that \"extend\nwell beyond actual ownership of real estate, chattels, or money,\" Roth, 408 U.S. at 572, 92 S.Ct. at 2706, and\nparalleling the expansion of \"liberty,\" has been held to include a number of intangible, statutorily created\n\"entitlements.\" See Duchesne v. Williams, No. 86-1017, slip op. at 11 (6th Cir. June 16, 1987). As stated in Perry\nv. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972):\n\"property\" interests subject to procedural due process are not limited by a few rigid, technical\nforms. Rather, \"property\" denotes a broad range of interests that are secured by \"existing rules or\nunderstandings.\" ... A person's interest in a benefit is a \"property\" interest for due process\npurposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim of\nentitlement to the benefit....\nId. at 601, 92 S.Ct. at 2699.\nYet, despite the rather broad, outer contours that have been ascribed to both liberty and property, \"the range of\n[these] interests ... is not infinite.\" Roth, 408 U.S. at 570, 92 S.Ct. at 2705. In order to establish that a claimed\ninterest is a property interest meriting due process protection, an individual must demonstrate that two\ninterrelated criteria are met. First, he must show that the claimed interest stems from an independent source of\nlaw, such as a \"statute or legal rule or ... mutually explicit understanding.\" Leis v. Flynt, 439 U.S. 438, 442, 99\nS.Ct. 698, 700-01, 58 L.Ed.2d 717 (1979). As explained by Roth:\nProperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and\ntheir dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent\nsource such as state law 00 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support\n97\nclaims of entitlement to those benefits.\nId.408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. Second, he must show that the independent source of law bestows upon\nhim a \"legitimate claim of entitlement.\" In the words of Roth, \"[t]o have a property interest in a benefit, a person\nmust have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He\nmust, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" Id. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. Illustrative cases applying\n\n[15] [16]\nthese principles to find that a particular statutory scheme created a property interest  or a liberty interest\nunder the due process clause are collected in the margin.\n1283 *1283 The plaintiffs in this case contend that Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.16 (Supp. 1986) creates a property\ninterest. Section 5123.16 provides, in pertinent part, that:\nThe department of mental retardation and developmental disabilities and any institutions under its\nsupervision or jurisdiction shall, where applicable, by July 1, 1982, be in substantial compliance\nwith standards set forth for mental retardation facilities by the accreditation council for services for\nmentally retarded and other developmentally disabled persons or medical assistance standards\nunder Title XIX of the \"Social Security Act,\" as amended, except that the department and any\ninstitution under its supervision or jurisdiction shall be in substantial compliance with standards for\nphysical facilities and equipment by January 1, 1983.\nThere can be no question that plaintiffs have satisfied the first Roth requirement. This is not a case in which\nplaintiffs have merely alleged a denial of due process simpliciter. Cf. Wilson v. Beebe, 770 F.2d 578, 585 (6th\nCir.1985) (en banc). To the contrary, plaintiffs have identified a state statute as the source of the interest they are\nclaiming. This satisfies Roth's requirement that the putative property interest stem from \"an independent source\nsuch as state law.\" Id.408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. The inquiry, therefore, must focus on whether the\nstatute in question bestows upon plaintiffs a legitimate claim of entitlement.\nThe defendants argue vigorously that it does not. They argue that while § 5123.16 \"expresses the Legislature's\nintent to have all developmental centers operated in substantial compliance with the Medicaid provisions, it\nnowhere guarantees a mentally retarded resident an entitlement to be placed in such a facility.\" They further\nargue that § 5123.16 fails to specify \"what happens if the center fails to be in substantial compliance\" with the\nMedicaid provisions.\nDefendants' argument does have some superficial appeal. There can be no dispute that § 5123.16 imposes a\nperemptory, nondiscretionary duty upon the Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities to\nmaintain its institutions in accordance with Title XIX standards. However, the statute fails to state who is\nempowered to enforce its provisions if ODMRDD fails in the performance of this duty, or what the remedy for non-\nperformance is. Thus, it could be argued that because § 5123.16 does not expressly state that an institutionalized\nmentally retarded person has the right to enforce § 5123.16's commands, the only person who may do so is the\ngovernor of the state, and that his sole remedy is to dismiss the derelict officials and appoint new ones.\nHowever, in attempting to divine the Ohio General Assembly's intent in enacting § 5123.16, this Court must not\nnarrowly focus upon the language of § 5123.16 alone. As stated in Pennhurst State School v. Halderman, 451\nU.S. 1, 18, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 1540, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981), \"In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a\nsingle sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and\npolicy.\" Id. at 18, 101 S.Ct. at 2625 (quoting Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707, 713, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44\nL.Ed.2d 525 (1975)). Thus, § 5123.16 must be \"read in the context of other more specific provisions of the Act\" of\nwhich it is a part. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 19, 101 S.Ct. at 2625.\nThe provisions presently codified as § 5123.16 of the Ohio Revised Code are merely a fractional part of a more\n1284 extensive enactment, Am.Sub. House Bill 900, *1284 passed by the Ohio General Assembly in 1980. See\nBaldwin's Ohio Legislative Service (1980) at 5-242. Among other things, the act abolished the Ohio Department\nof Mental Health and Mental Retardation, and transferred its functions to two newly created departments, the\nDepartment of Mental Health, and the Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. See\nAm.Sub. House Bill 900, § 4, Baldwin's Ohio Legislative Service (1980) at 5-318. The provisions of Am.Sub.\nHouse Bill 900 dealing with the care and treatment of the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled were\ncodified as chapter 5123 of the Ohio Revised Code. Amendments to chapter 5123 were subsequently made, and\nnew provisions were added, in 1981, 1983 and 1986.\nAs amended, chapter 5123 provides in comprehensive fashion for the care and treatment of the mentally\nretarded and developmentally disabled. Inter alia, it establishes the Department of Mental Retardation and\nDevelopmental Disabilities and defines the Department's powers and duties (§ 5123.02); provides that the\n\nDepartment shall maintain, operate, manage and govern all state institutions for the care, treatment and training\nof the mentally retarded (§ 5123.03); provides that the Department and institutions under its jurisdiction shall be\nin substantial compliance with the standards of Title XIX of the Social Security Act (§ 5123.16); and designates\nthe Department as \"the sole agency to establish and administer the statewide plans required as a condition of\nreceiving federal assistance under the `Developmental Disabilities Services and Construction Act,' ... 42 U.S.C. §\n6001, as amended.\" (§ 5123.35).\nAdditionally, chapter 5123 creates a Legal Rights Service charged with the duty of protecting and advocating the\nrights of mentally ill and developmentally disabled persons (§ 5123.60). Inter alia, the Legal Rights Service is\nempowered to receive and act upon complaints concerning conditions of institutions for the mentally retarded (§\n5123.60(A)), and to \"initiate actions in mandamus and such other legal and equitable remedies as may be\nnecessary to accomplish the purposes of\" chapter 5123 (§ 5123.60(G)).\nFinally, pursuant to the provisions added in 1986, chapter 5123 establishes a \"Bill of Rights\" for mentally retarded\nand developmentally disabled persons (§ 5123.62). Inter alia, the Bill of Rights provides that the mentally\nretarded have \"[t]he right to an appropriate, safe, and sanitary living environment that complies with local, state\nand federal standards (§ 5123.60(B)); the \"right of access to necessary ancillary services including, but not\nlimited to, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, and behavior modification and other\npsychological services (§ 5123.60(F)); and the \"right to receive appropriate care and treatment in the least\nintrusive manner (§ 5123.60(G)). If any of these rights are abridged, § 5123.64 specifically provides that the\naffected mentally retarded person may sue for enforcement. Section 5123.64(B) provides, in pertinent part, that:\nAny mentally retarded or developmentally disabled person who believes that his or her rights as\nenumerated in Section 5123.62 of the Revised Code have been violated may ... [t]ake any ...\nappropriate action to ensure compliance with sections 5123.60 to 5123.64 of the Revised Code, \nincluding the filing of a legal action to enforce rights or to recover damages for violation of rights.\n(Emphasis added.) To the extent that there is any doubt as to how these provisions are to be construed, or who\nthe intended beneficiaries are, such doubt is totally dispelled by § 5123.34 which provides, inter alia, that \"[t]his\nchapter [5123] attempts ... [t]o provide humane and scientific treatment and care and the highest attainable\ndegree of individual development for mentally retarded persons admitted to state institutions.\" Ohio Rev.Code\nAnn. § 5123.34(A) (1981) (emphasis added).\n[17]\nThis Court is of the opinion that when these provisions are construed in pari materia, as they must be,  it\n1285 becomes *1285 clear that mentally retarded persons admitted to state institutions have a legitimate claim of\nentitlement to be cared for in an institution that meets the standards of Title XIX of the Social Security Act.\nSection 5123.16 of the Revised Code imposes a peremptory, non-discretionary duty upon ODMRDD to maintain\nall state institutions in accordance with those standards. Section 5123.34(A) indicates that the mentally retarded\nare the intended beneficiaries of the duties imposed by § 5123.16, and in addition thereto, § 5123.60(B)\nexpressly guarantees that the mentally retarded have the right to \"an appropriate, safe, and sanitary living\nenvironment that complies with local, state, and federal standards.\" Finally, §§ 5123.60(G) and 5123.64(B)\nspecifically provide that mentally retarded persons may sue to enforce these rights. Indeed, the statutory scheme\ninvolved here presents a far more compelling case for finding a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" than those\n[18]\nanalyzed in any of the reported decisions found by this Court.\nThis, however, does not end the inquiry. Having found that Ohio's statutory scheme creates a legitimate claim of\nentitlement meriting due process protection, it is now necessary to determine what process is due. In most cases,\nlitigants seek some kind of procedural protections, arguing that they are entitled to some form of notice and\nhearing before the state can take away the property interest involved. The instant plaintiffs, however, make no\nsuch claim in this case. Rather, they seek a mandatory injunction directing the defendants to bring CDC back into\ncompliance with Title XIX requirements. In essence, they argue that § 5123.16 creates substantive rights which\ncannot be taken from them no matter what procedural protections are afforded. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S.\n517, 541 n. 4, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3207-3208 n. 4, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (separate opinion of Stevens, J.); Wilson v.\nBeebe, 770 F.2d at 586.\n\nThe due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is comprised of both procedural and substantive\ncomponents. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 677-78, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring); Harrah Independent School District v. Martin, 440 U.S. 194, 197-99, 99 S.Ct. 1062, 1063-64, 59\nL.Ed.2d 248 (1979). Procedural due process accords an individual the right to a fair hearing before being\ndeprived of a liberty or property interest. See, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557-58, 94 S.Ct. 2963,\n2975-76, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Substantive due process, on the other hand, protects the individual from being\ndeprived of liberty or property except for legally recognized, legally justified reasons.\nThe distinction between substantive and procedural due process can be illustrated by an examination of \nCleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). In that case, a\nsecurity guard for the Cleveland, Ohio, Board of Education (a \"classified civil servant\") was fired when it was\ndiscovered that he failed to disclose on his job application the fact that he had been previously convicted of a\nfelony. Ohio's statutes provided that classified civil servants were entitled to hold their jobs \"`during good behavior\nand efficient service,'\" and could not be discharged \"`except ... for ... misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance\n1286 in office ...'\" 470 U.S. at *1286 538-39, 105 S.Ct. at 1491 (quoting Ohio Rev.Code Ann. §§ 124.11, 124.34\n(1984)). The Court found that these statutes created a substantive right which could not be taken away without\ndue process. 470 U.S. at 540-41, 105 S.Ct. at 1492-93. The Court went on to hold that the procedural component\nof the due process clause was violated because the employee had been fired without being afforded \"a\npretermination opportunity to respond\" to the charge against him. 470 U.S. at 548, 105 S.Ct. at 1492. By way of\ncontrast, the substantive component of the due process clause would have been violated if the employee had\nbeen fired for reasons other than \"misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office,\" because these were the\nonly legally recognized, legally justified reasons for discharge under the statutes creating the substantive right.\nThus, if the employee had been fired, for instance, because of a personal dispute with his supervisor that was\nunrelated to his job, his discharge would have violated substantive due process. See Hearn v. City of Gainesville,\n688 F.2d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.1982) (discharge of public employee on pretextual grounds, unrelated to proper\nreasons for layoff, violates substantive due process). Several recent decisions have stressed the fact that\nsubstantive due process can be violated even when all procedural requirements have been scrupulously\nobserved. See, e.g., Daniels v. Williams, 106 S.Ct. at 665; Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 541 n. 4, 104 S.Ct.\n3194, 3207-08 n. 4, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (separate opinion of Stevens, J.); Franklin v. Aycock, 795 F.2d 1253,\n1259 (6th Cir.1986). For example, in Nishiyama v. Dickson County, Tennessee, 814 F.2d 277 (6th Cir.1987), the\nSixth Circuit stated:\nIn Wilson v. Beebe, 770 F.2d 578, 583 (6th Cir.1985), this Court recognized that section 1983\nprovides a remedy for both procedural and substantive due process violations, and the Supreme\nCourt made clear in Daniels v. Williams ... that there are certain types of government acts that\nviolate the Due Process Clause regardless of the procedures used to implement them. When the\ngovernment engages in such conduct, there is a remedy under section 1983.\nId. at 281, emphasis added.\nNumerous cases state, as a general proposition, that for a plaintiff to establish a substantive due process\n[19]\nviolation, he must prove that the state or its agent acted arbitrarily.  An analysis of these cases discloses that,\nin each instance, the act complained of was a discretionary act, and the actor (state official) was vested with\nsome degree of discretion. Obviously, a state official does not violate any individual's rights so long as he acts\nwithin the scope of his discretion. In order to violate substantive due process, there must be an abuse of official\npower. Daniels v. Williams, 106 S.Ct. at 664-65; Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 549, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1919, 68\nL.Ed.2d 420 (1981) (Stewart, J., concurring). Thus, it is only when an official exceeds his discretion or abuses it\nthat substantive due process is violated.\nFor this reason, this Court perceives the requirement of \"arbitrariness\" to be tantamount to a requirement that a\nstate official vested with discretion do something to clearly exceed or abuse that discretion. Since state officials\nalmost always have some, if not broad, discretion, the vast majority of cases reviewing state action on\nsubstantive due process grounds have involved the review of discretionary acts. Hence, the reported decisions\nhave routinely required a showing of arbitrary action to establish a substantive due process violation.\n\nThis case, therefore, presents a somewhat unique situation because the instant defendants have no discretion.\n1287 To the contrary, *1287 Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.16 imposes a mandatory duty upon DMRDD to maintain the\ninstitutions under its control in compliance with Title XIX standards. This statutory duty is peremptory in nature\nand admits of no discretion. Since arbitrariness is an element of a substantive due process claim only when the\naction complained of is action committed to the discretion of state officials, and since the defendants here have\nno discretion, the requirement of pleading and proving arbitrariness is inapplicable. Accordingly, this Court holds\nthat to establish a violation of substantive due process under the circumstances of this case, plaintiffs need only\nplead and prove that defendants failed to perform their statutory, mandatory duty under § 5123.16, and that this\nfailure harmed the plaintiffs.\nIn the alternative, this Court holds that where, as here, a state official fails to perform a mandatory,\nnondiscretionary statutory duty, such failure is ipso facto arbitrary. The Court arrives at this conclusion by two\nseparate routes. First, action has traditionally been deemed arbitrary if it is not rationally related to a legitimate\ngovernmental purpose, Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 525, 54 S.Ct. 505, 510, 78 L.Ed. 940 (1934); lacks\nreasonable justification, Canty v. Board of Education, 312 F.Supp. 254, 256 (S.D.N.Y.1970); or \"is taken without\nany authority of law or upon a misconstruction of the statutory authority under which it purports to be taken....\" \nAntilles Industries, Inc. v. Virgin Islands, 388 F.Supp. 315, 322 (D.V.I.1974) (quoting In re Hooper's Estate, 359\nF.2d 569, 575 n. 7 (3d Cir.1966)). The statute under which action is purportedly taken is the starting point for\ndetermining whether the action has a reasonable justification or legitimate governmental purpose. For example,\nin Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, the statutory scheme created a property interest in employment\nwhich could be taken away only for \"misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office.\" 470 U.S. at 538-39,\n105 S.Ct. at 1491-92. Thus, under the statute, the only reasonable justification or legitimate governmental\npurpose for state action terminating employment was \"misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office.\"\nTermination of employment for any other reason, e.g., for personal animosity between the employee and his\nsupervisor, would be outside the scope of legitimate governmental purpose and, hence, would be arbitrary. Hearn\nv. City of Gainesville, 688 F.2d at 1332-33.\nUnlike the statutory scheme involved in Loudermill, the statute involved in this case (Ohio Rev.Code Ann. §\n5123.16), articulates no reasons or circumstances justifying termination of the benefits it bestows. To the\ncontrary, it imposes a mandatory duty on ODMRDD to bring its institutions in compliance with Title XIX standards\nand, correspondingly, bestows an absolute right upon plaintiffs to be placed in such an institution. Since there can\nbe no reasonable justification or legitimate governmental purpose for ODMRDD's failure to perform this duty, its\nfailure is ipso facto arbitrary.\nThe same result is obtained by pursuing a more recent line of judicial analysis. Recent decisions have indicated\nthat a state official acts arbitrarily if he acts with something more than mere negligence, e.g., if he acts\ndeliberately or intentionally, Daniels v. Williams, 106 S.Ct. at 665, 667 n. 3, or with gross negligence, Nishiyama v.\nDickson County, Tennessee, 814 F.2d at 282. In this case, defendants would be deemed to act intentionally if\nthey had a conscious desire to allow the state institutions under their control fall below Title XIX standards, or if\nthey knew that their action (or inaction) would be substantially certain to have that result. See ALI Restatement of\nthe Law, 2d, Torts, § 8A. As stated by the Restatement:\nIntent is not ... limited to consequences which are desired. If the actor knows that the\nconsequences are certain, or substantially certain, to result from his act, and still goes ahead, he\nis treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result.\nId., Comment b.\n1288 Even if the defendants in this case had no conscious desire to deprive the plaintiffs *1288 of their right to be\nplaced in an institution meeting Title XIX standards, it seems apparent that they knew with substantial certainty\nthat this would result from their failure to perform the duty imposed upon them by section 5123.16. Hence, their\naction (or inaction) must be deemed intentional and, thus, arbitrary.\nFor all of these reasons, the Court concludes that the complaint states a claim for violation of fourteenth\namendment substantive due process.\n\nV.\nFor the reasons set forth in Part II of this decision, defendants' motion to dismiss the claim predicated upon the\nMedicaid provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq., is hereby granted. In all other\nrespects, defendants' motion to dismiss is hereby denied.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] The named plaintiffs are (a) Phillip Nicoletti, a 46-year-old mentally retarded male resident of CDC, through\nhis parents, Michael (also legal guardian) and Nancy Nicoletti; (b) Frank Koniecdynski, a 65-year-old mentally\nretarded male resident of CDC, through his sister and legal guardian, Claire Gondiek; (c) Donna Marie Horvoth, a\n51-year-old mentally retarded female, through her mother, Nancy Horvoth; and (d) Wayne and Wanda Cook, 31-\nyear-old mentally retarded brother and sister, through their parents, Mary Ann (also legal guardian) and Andrew\nCook. The named plaintiffs seek to bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated\npersons at the CDC, and have requested the Court to certify this case as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.\n23.\n[2] The authority and duties of the ODMRDD are found in Ohio Rev.Code Ann. §§ 5123.01, et seq. Ohio\nRev.Code Ann. § 5123.03 states that \"The department shall: (A) Maintain, operate, manage, and govern all state\ninstitutions for the care, treatment, and training of the mentally retarded....\" Additionally, the ODMRDD is given\npowers not expressly enumerated in the statutes in the areas of executive, administrative, and fiscal supervision\nof the state institutions. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.03(H). \nDefendant Robert Brown, Director of the ODMRDD, derives his authority from Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 5123.04.\nIncluded in his duties are the adoption of rules for the proper execution of the duties of the ODMRDD and the\nappointment of employees. Additionally, the director is given general supervisory powers over the two divisions of\nthe ODMRDD, the division of administrative services and the division of mental retardation and developmental\ndisabilities. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.05.\n[3] A major revision of the Disabled Assistance Act occurred in 1984 with the enactment of Pub.L. No. 98-527,\nOctober 19, 1984, 98 Stat. 2662. All citations in this opinion are to the current sections of the Disabled Assistance\nAct. Where the Court makes references to sections of the Act mentioned in cases decided before the\namendments, the Court has substituted the current statutory citations for the previous citations.\n[4] The plaintiffs state in their complaint and briefs that the rights which they allege have been denied them arise\nout of 42 U.S.C. §§ 6009 and 6011(a). The Court takes notice that these provisions of the Disabled Assistance\nAct have been amended and that the \"rights\" cited by the plaintiffs are not contained within the statutory citations\ngiven by them. 42 U.S.C. § 6009, entitled \"Congressional finding regarding rights of the developmentally\ndisabled,\" is the same statutory provision that was construed in Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman,\n451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). The Court finds that any arguments by the plaintiffs regarding\n§ 6009 are controlled by the decision of the Supreme Court in Pennhurst. The Court, therefore, interprets the\nplaintiffs' arguments as being based on 42 U.S.C. §§ 6023 (habilitation plan) and 6042 (advocacy system).\n[5] The statutory provision construed in Pennhurst I is presently codified as 42 U.S.C. § 6009. At the time \nPennhurst I was decided, however, this provision was codified as 42 U.S.C. § 6011. See supra note 3.\n[6] The Court distinguishes the present cause of action brought pursuant to the Disabled Assistance Act, from the\ncause of action brought pursuant to the provisions of the Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.16. (See section IV of this\nOpinion.) The enabling legislation which gives the ODMMR the authority to dispense funds received under this\nAct does not include the type of mandatory language contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 5123.16. Compare\nOhio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.35 (\"The director of mental retardation and developmental disabilities may receive\nand administer any funds granted to this state under such federal acts.... The department may take any action\nnecessary to comply with such federal acts....\") with Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.16 (\"The department of mental\n\nretardation and developmental disabilities ... shall ... be in substantial compliance with standards set forth ...\nunder Title XIX of the `Social Security Act'....\") (emphasis added).\n[[7]] The term \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 42 U.S.C. § 6001(14).\n[8] The Court holds, and the defendants to not contest, that the defendants' alleged action committed pursuant to\ntheir statutory authority, are actions \"under color of law\" for purpose of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n[9] Legislative intent is the controlling factor in the interpretation of statutes. United States v. N.E. Rosenblum\nTruck Lines, Inc., 315 U.S. 50, 53, 62 S.Ct. 445, 447-448, 86 L.Ed. 671 (1942). Despite this well-known fact,\nlegislators frequently fail to express their intent in the statutory language or elsewhere. Such silence is difficult to\njustify, not only because it forces courts to resort to tedious methods of statutory divination, but also because it\nrisks abortion of the entire statutory agenda if the court is less than a proficient mindreader. This is such a case.\nNowhere in the language of the Disabled Assistance Act did Congress state whether it intended to create rights\nenforceable by the disabled. A refreshing contrast is Ohio's own version of the Disabled Assistance Act, Ohio\nRev. Code Ann. §§ 5123.62, et seq. So as to leave no doubt that it intended to create rights which could be\nenforced through private lawsuits, the Ohio General Assembly expressly provided that, \"[a]ny mentally retarded\nor developmentally disabled person who believes that his or her rights ... have been violated ... may file ... a legal\naction to enforce [those] rights or to recover damages....\" Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 5123.64(B) (Supp.1986).\n[10] The state plan, with the proper assurances, must be approved by the Secretary prior to the receipt of federal\nfunds. 45 C.F.R. § 1386.31(b). (\"Failure to submit an approvable state plan or amendment prior to the Federal\nfiscal years for which it is applicable may result in the loss of Federal financial participation. Costs resulting from\nobligations incurred during the period of the fiscal year for which an approved plan is not in effect are not eligible\nfor Federal financial participation.\")\n[11] Noncompliance with the state plan can result in the termination of funds under the Disabled Assistance Act.\n45 C.F.R. § 1386.30(b). (\"Failure to comply with State plan requirements may result in loss of Federal funds....\")\n[12]See Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 426-427, 107 S.Ct. 766,\n772-773, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987) (using Housing and Urban Development regulations to determine whether\nplaintiffs had private cause of action under the Brooke Amendment to the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § 1437\n(a)).\n[13] The plaintiffs, in Middlesex, had failed to comply with a specific requirement contained in the separate citizen\nsuit provisions.
