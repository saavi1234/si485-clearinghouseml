While Therap may indeed be a third party provider to DSPDI, this was as a result of the JCC finding Therap and convincing DSPDI, USDOJ and ultimately the Court, that such services were essential and necessary. It is inconceivable that at this juncture into FY 2020-21 the Therap contract is still not perfected. If the matter is not resolved affirmatively by October 22, the Court will not hesitate in taking the necessary action. Moreover, DSPDI must explain why it has underutilized Therap's services even when these have been available. This it shall do in its pre-hearing memorandum. Signed by Judge Gustavo A.

This is an initial meeting intended for the benefit of DSPDI and the participants. It is no adversarial meeting as the JCC is not a party, but rather a collaborative one, as the JCC and DSPDI have done in the past for many years. More so, the Court notes that DSPDI after almost twenty years of being subjected to a federal consent decree calling for court monitoring would now want to reexamine how matters are coordinated, run and by whom, to wit, under its own terms and conditions. If DSPDI wants to litigate the matter it should do so with USDOJ who is the other party to this consent decree case, and not the JCC, who is simply acting on the Court's behalf as he had done so for two decades without issue. The Court notes DSPDI's continued objections at Docket No. 3206. The same, however, are not reason for not complying with the Court's directives in enforcing the consent decree before it.

From the Court's perspective, thus, all positive momentum in this consent decree has long since ceased and the Commonwealth is backtracking to 1999. This is the second occasion in weeks that USDOJ has asked the Court to take remedial action (something that has never before occurred). Moreover, USDOJ -more than once in its motion- posits that DSPDI has ignored court orders, as well as its recommendations. This case finds itself at a crossroads. If the Commonwealth cannot effectively act, drastic remedial action is looming in the horizon. Justice Ginsburg's legacy in Olmstead is a civil rights beacon of hope to all participants, whom the United States Department of Justice and this Court have been called to protect.

Moreover, the JCC, as an officer of the Court, may also (as in the past) submit directives at the meeting itself, or in advance and in writing, as to the mode, manner and order of each meeting. The parties, their experts and staff, as well as counsel, are expected to fully cooperate with the JCC. All are reminded as well that following each meeting or series of meetings, the JCC is tasked with issuing a corresponding report to the Court. Moreover, such meetings are collaborative exercises and not litigious ones. The Court moreover in these meetings is giving DSPDI the opportunity to resolve the many issues that have arisen, rather than have to take the immediate remedial action it has advanced may ultimately be the only necessary alternative.

Second, the Court grants DSPDI until July 29, 2020 to translate the documents. However, if USDOJ requests an earlier uncertified and/or unofficial translation it must immediately be provided, even if verbally. Third, DSPDI documents such as the reopening plan are frequent in this case. They must diligently be translated and submitted in English. Otherwise prompt resolution of any matter is stalled. Thus, DSPDI needs to have a translator on call at all times as this is a federal court proceeding where the applicable and only language is English. This norm, going on forward, will apply not only to pleadings filed, but also to all matters where USDOJ counsel is present. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 7/16/2020.

The Commonwealth's arguments deflect attention away from its many missteps, while focusing a negative spotlight on the Court, the JCC, and the USDOJ all purportedly acting in concert as if conspiring to harm the DSPDI program. Granting the request for more time on said grounds would constitute carte blanche so DSPDI can continue to act with impunity in violation of the consent decree.

Cannot the same be held virtually? The Court, for example, remains closed until at least February 11, 2020, upon consulting with its own epidemiologist and other experts. Even the judges meet virtually for most matters requiring multiple persons to gather. All of this, in an abundance of the utmost caution. DSPDI shall inform the Court this afternoon by 6:00 PM its position as to whether it will postpone the event, or otherwise hold the same virtually. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 11/20/2020.

The Commonwealth is hereby ordered, on or before 3/25/18, to provide in a restricted motion all of the information requested by USDOJ at page 7 of its motion. The Court advances that it will set a hearing as to this matter at a date to be announced. If warranted, the Court will explore all possible remedies for the JCAP MRC non-compliance.

A final tally shall be made and the Commonwealth will then be required to pay the total sanction. Although nominal, orders are orders and these must be complied with for the reasons stated by the Court. Just last night -- the Sunday before the public hearing -- the JCC informed that he was continuing to receive information from DSPDI. This cannot occur again. Judge Lopez, if warranted, may modify the order of Health Department Officials who appear, and also extend the hearing past Tuesday. These late submissions have highly burdened the Court, for example requiring that the undersigned last night request assistance from a second magistrate judge for duty matters that Judge Lopez would attend to during breaks during public hearings, and also having the JCC, Judge Lopez, and the undersigned to communicate at bedtime.

The Court then forewarned that a receivership limited to the matter could ensue if not resolved. Judge Lopez shall issue deadlines, which if not strictly complied with result in further action by the Court. Given the Commonwealths financial woes, the Court would not like to have to consider thus the prospect of contempt and sanctions. Finally, the JCC and staff need to urgently have office space. The work of the JCC has increased over the last half decade and it is no longer feasible for the Court nor parties to expect him to provide his private office for meetings, document storage and all other matters. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 7-5-19. (Gelpi, Gustavo) (Entered: 07/05/2019)"

The Court notes the comprehensive COVID-19 protocol submitted by the JCC, prepared following the submission of the Commonwealth's draft protocol. This protocol contains the several crucial items addressed by the DSPDI COVID-19 Task Force, and now has the benefit of adding the recommendations made by the JCC's team of expert consultants from the U.S. Mainland, and also takes into account observations of the participants, relatives and providers, as well as any related court order. It is thus perhaps the most comprehensive document that can be prepared in such a short time frame with an imperative call to action from all. The Commonwealth/DSPDI will inform by tomorrow March 30, 2020 before 5:00 p.m. whether the protocol is acceptable to is as an initial working tool during this pandemic. Time is of the very essence as the pandemic number of infected persons and deaths is on the rise. More so, the protocol as it is now presented may be readily amended as conditions change. SO ORDERED.

In addition, the Court has carefully reviewed the red lined version of the Protocol submitted this afternoon by the Commonwealth (Docket No, 2764). USDOJ has not voiced any concerns as to the JCCs Protocol. Having considered the suggested modifications in the red lined document, the Court finds that at this moment, the same do not alter significantly the JCCs Protocol. As such, the Court ADOPTS the JCCs Protocol in its entirety and will immediately make the same public and effective. As the Court stated in its Order at Docket No. 2762, this Protocol constitutes a working document, which may be modified by the Court upon agreement of the parties. The Court is fully aware that unforeseen circumstances will arise and will require the joint collaboration of all. More so, the Court is also aware that the Protocol will result in financial readjustment by the Health Department. However, the emergency requires it when countless lives are at stake. The Court commends the parties and JCC for their Herculean effort to the benefit of the several hundred participants. The JCC will proceed to monitor and assist the Commonwealth in the the Protocols implementation. Signed by Judge Gustavo A.

This is a matter that the Court addressed at Thursday's conference when Hacienda Don Luis was compromised due to the 41 transfers from Fundacion Modesto Gotay, several of these to the Hacienda. Due to this most current emergency, the Court thus instructs the DSPDI Director Dr. Joan Rivera and JCC Alfredo Castellanos to immediately confer as to this matter and agree to a solution within the established Covid-19 protocol. This is a most urgent matter which needs to be attended to now, and indeed DSPDI may be in the process of doing so. However, the JCC needs to be informed now. At the conference on Thursday the Court has asked all to exchange telephone numbers. At this time the JCC still does not have a manner in which to contact the Director directly (something that was never an issue in the past). The JCC shall inform via motion the outcome of the isolation issue on Monday. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 8/15/2020.(MET) (Entered: 08/15/2020)"

However, while the Court has not addressed the multiple points and recommendations made by the JCC, it nonetheless has issued two very specific directives regarding the Ama de Llaves program. Notwithstanding, the Court again must insist that instead of an all out nuclear war between DSPDI and JCC the entire gamut of these issues should be resolved without any court intervention. This is the never ending story; one issue after another. As noted in the previous order (Docket No. 2979 ), the JCC is entitled to access information about the DSPDI program, its participants and providers. The litany of issues raised just in 2020 countervails the quintessential essence and purpose of a consent decree such as this (versus a contested injunction). While at this time, the Court is not ruling on any meritorious matters, this is a draining, time consuming and unnecessary litigious process. Moreover, the Court can only fathom that it must be a most enigmatic puzzlement to USDOJ how this case keeps revolving on the Monitor's actions and continues to get more complicated by the minute. DSPDI does not control the Court nor JCC's ability to monitor effectively. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 7/29/2020. (CRH) (Entered: 07/29/2020)"

          "description": "ORDER: Noted 3157 Motion In Compliance as to 3156 Order on Informative Motion. Once more, the Court finds itself with a situation wherein DSPDI is in complete disagreement with the JCC inasmuch as to what exactly has transpired and as to the mode and matter communicated. At this time, the Court shall not dwell on the matter of flow of information between DSPDI and the JCC, since its primary concern is the health and well being of the participants, who themselves constitute a more vulnerable population group. Moreover, again, DSPDI disagrees entirely with the medical recommendations of UMass conveyed by way of the JCC in this instance. It would seem, thus, that there are two entirely different medical standards of care and to DSPDI that of UMass is never correct. The Court is hence placed in the unenviable position of again having to intervene. Having considered both the starkly contrasting positions of UMass and DSPDI, as well as the health and safety of the participants at both homes, the Court hereby ORDERS that all participants at both homes be administered molecular Covid-19 tests tomorrow, September 30, 2020. The cost and burden to DSPDI is minimal, and it will either put all matters at rest, or require (upon positive results) that DSPDI take further immediate action. Moreover, at this time, the Court is not ordering DSPDI to do anything beyond this simple matter. The JCC will immediately be informed of the molecular test results. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 9/19/2020. (CRH) (Entered: 09/29/2020)"

The meeting(s) of medical experts shall take place as ordered by the Court outside the presence of counsel as well as the JCC (whose limited role is to coordinate the same as per Court order). The meeting of medical experts is not a court proceeding. As in the past, the expert consultants of the JCC are simply to meet with those of DSPDI in good medical faith to discuss and address issues as to which ultimately the participants will benefit from. To simplify matters, the Court hereby amends its order at Docket No. 3165 to limit the discussions to polypharmacy. The Court is not ordering that DSPDI reach a legal settlement nor a binding agreement with the JCC. The JCC's experts have been retained to help DSPDI. Indeed, in the past, they have effectively met with those from DSPDI (i.e., Dr. Maria T. Margarida-Julia provided capacitation to DSPDI personnel as to how to conduct evaluations to change participant diagnostics). In sum, what the Court is directing is a joint collaborative effort between DSPDI and JCC experts. USDOJ has not objected to the Court's order at Docket No. 3165 . Moreover, at Docket No. 3142 USDOJ asked the Court to \"direct the Commonwealth to implement remedial actions necessary to resolve outstanding polypharmacy issues among participants.\" The Court's Order at Docket No. 3165 is hence an opportunity for DSPDI to collaborate with the JCC so that remedial court-ordered action as to polypahramacy be the least drastic possible, or even perhaps unnecessary.

The situation meticulously detailed by the JCC is a systemic and recurring problem within DSPDI generated by the Commonwealth's bureaucratic organization. This, however, is a problem as to which the Court cannot idly sit and wait for the Commonwealth to eventually resolve. At stake are the lives and mental, as well as physical, well-being of numerous participants, who may be severely affected if the provider homes are unable to operate due to lack of contractual payment for essential services rendered. Add to this predicament the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting amalgam can be lethal to one or more participants. The Court, thus, is not willing to place at risk any participant lives. Accordingly, DSPDI is given until Thursday October 29, 2020 at 5:00 pm to affirmatively resolve this matter and certify the same to the Court as to each outstanding provider. If any provider has happenstance failed to comply with Commonwealth contractual requirements, DSPDI shall so specifically indicate. This matter should have by now in any event been resolved.

The Court will not impose a sanction on DSPDI given that no participants were attending the CTS in question. Moreover, DSPDI is correct that the Court previously had not specifically issued any order directing it to inform of Covid-19 exposure as to its employees and contractors. Nonetheless, this is relevant information which should in any event be provided to the JCC. For example, at paragraph 7 of its motion, DSPDI notes that the three employees who tested positive for Covid-19, \"had not been rendering in-person services to participants since at least two weeks prior to the positive results.\" This is most fortunate. But what if the employees had indeed been in contact with participants? The JCC is indeed entitled to be aware of such matters, since he cannot effectively monitor and make recommendations without a full picture. In the past, DSPDI regularly informed the JCC of all matters affecting the program, and court orders were the exception and not the norm. It now seems that DSPDI will not inform nor update unless so ordered. Accordingly, the Court's Order at Docket No. 3228 is now likewise extended, and thus applicable to informing of, all employees and contractors with or exposed to Covid-19. Signed by Judge Gustavo A.

The Court has carefully reviewed the JCC's invoices and finds that for the work performed during October 2020 is more than reasonable. This, given the extraordinary number of distinct and important matters the JCC has had to address. The Court further reincorporates the rationale in its orders at Docket Nos. 3200 & 3216 . Moreover, the JCC is operating under an annual budget so all compensation and expenses will not exceed the same. As such, the Commonwealth is not going to be expending more than it already has deposited with the Court as the JCC's FY 2020-21 budget. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 11/10/2020.

DSPDI will also certify that these are all the available documents and that no further ones exist. The deadline is final. DSPDI's response at Docket No. 3284 is Noted. So is the confidential exhibit filed at Docket No. 3285 . These have been reviewed by the Court. The JCC in his request was meticulously clear in exactly what was sought. However, what he in fact received was not what he specifically asked for (see Docket No. 3283-1 (\"[B]ut not limited to, the dates and times of the aforementioned meetings; the names of the persons that participated in the same; and personal contact information; and any minutes or documents prepared regarding said meetings.\"). This is a proper request under a consent decree, and not a discovery dispute. Moreover, given that the confidential exhibit does not contain all of the documents and information sought, but rather constitutes an after the fact document, the JCC correctly requested the Court to issue this further order. The documents submitted by the Commonwealth are accepted provisionally in Spanish (although no leave was sought to so file), however must all be translated to English for the record on or before December 1, 2020.

It is utterly inconceivable that in December 2020, such a number of essential services providers are still without a formalized contract. Never before has the Court seen this occur. The Order at Docket No. 3259 remains in effect and applies to outstanding payments for services rendered with or without contract for the month of November, 2020. Payments will be made to all no later than December 15, 2020. Moreover, all outstanding payments for previous months (if any remain) are also due on said same date. The Court is further considering as a future remedial action to order that these service provider contracts be reviewed and approved by the Court-Appointed Special Investigator and Auditor as meeting all necessary formalities for complying with the consent decree. Accordingly, the same will be perfected under federal law and avoid all governmental bureaucracy hurdles. If it were not for the orders of this Court, under Puerto Rico law, the providers are not even entitled to compensation for the essential services provided. If the remaining contracts are not formalized by December 15, 2020, then the Court will proceed to act. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 12/2/2020. (CRH) (Entered: 12/02/2020)"

The JCC shall follow up within 30 days. Regarding the Court's remedial decision (one of several during the past months) to have Monitoring personnel within DSPDI offices, this order is hereby temporarily stayed. USDOJ shall, accordingly respond to DSPDIs several arguments on the matter. The Court notes that just yesterday in the Police Reform consent decree Case No. 12-2039 (GAG), USDOJ in fact recognized the equitable jurisdiction that a court has to enforce such agreements by crafting appropriate remedies. See Docket No. 1661. Moreover, a procedural matter also lies in DSPDI's arguments, to wit, whether at this juncture, DSPDI can now go back to January 1, 2020 (or even earlier back to 1999) to contest every finding the Court has made of non-compliance with the JCCs requests for documents and information. USDOJ will also address this point. The Court's inclination is to deny such request which would only reopen every such past finding by the Court. Moreover, it would unnecessarily convert a consent decree monitoring case into a prolonged trial-like litigation against the Monitor, who is not even a party to this action. This would derail the very purpose of the consent agreement which is the protection of the participants' federal constitutional and statutory rights. See Order at Docket No. 3428. The incoming Health Secretary, Dr Mellado, should also seriously revisit and consider this matter as well. JCC personnel are not parties to this action and their purpose is to ascertain that DSPDI be in compliance. Rather than an enemy of the state as has unfortunately been the Commonwealths perception of all consent decree monitors the JCC should be looked upon as a helping hand. More than anyone, except USDOJ counsel Farano, of course, the undersigned District Judge has been patiently handling and working in this case for fifteen years, and would very much like to see closure during this quadrennial.

    "summary": "<p>On May 15, 1996, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sent notice to the Governor of Puerto Rico that it was conducting an investigation into the conditions of confinement at Integral Services (\"CIS\") in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, pursuant to its authority under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  CIS was one of six state-operated residential facilities serving persons with developmental disabilities in Puerto Rico.  The DOJ advised the Governor that it would be examining resident safety, the adequacy of medical care, training, staffing, the use of psychotropic medication, and issues involving community placement.  The investigation included a tour of the facility in February 1994 by the DOJ and its retained expert consultants in behavioral psychology and psychopharmacology. The DOJ also interviewed Department of Health officials, facility personnel, residents and their family members.  Pertinent documents and records were collected and reviewed.</p><p>On June 11, 1997, the DOJ issued a findings letter outlining the deficiencies it uncovered at CIS, which included: inadequate food, medicine, shelter and basic care; inadequate psychological, behavioral and psychiatric care and services; inadequate health care; and lack of any integrated community setting.  The DOJ also noted that it discovered that similar conditions may have existed at the five other state-operated mental retardation facilities.  The DOJ outlined minimum remedial measures to correct the problems at CIS and the other state-operated facilities.</p><p>Apparently Puerto Rico didn't undertake those remedial measures to the satisfaction of the federal government; on April 21, 1999, the U.S. Attorney General brought this action against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, its Governor, and other state officials. The complaint alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The complaint was largely a restatement of the DOJ findings listed above. The complaint requested a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from continuing the practices described in the complaint. </p><p>Nine days later, an interim settlement agreement was reached. Under the agreement, the Commonwealth was ordered to improve living conditions at its mental health facilities (e.g. clean drinking water, adequate meals, access to medication, protection of patients' personal belongings). Each element of the agreement had a different effective date. For example, the Commonwealth was to assure immediately that its staff did not neglect or abuse patients, but the Commonwealth had 90 days to provide adequate wheelchairs. Under this agreement, the U.S. had the right to inspect facilities in Puerto Rico as well as request documents, provided that the U.S. gave adequate notice prior to any investigation. Under this agreement, the Commonwealth was also to develop a community-based service plan (CBSP) for individuals with mental disabilities. This interim agreement would be in effect until a comprehensive agreement was reached and a CBSP was filed with the court.  Three months later the defendants filed a motion to extend time to \"file with plaintiff their draft community based system plan in accordance with the settlement agreement.\"</p><p>On September 6, 2001, a the Commonwealth filed a CBSP with the court. The U.S. filed a motion in support of the agreement on October 10. This plan was created with the goal of placing qualified individuals with mental disabilities who had been previous institutionalized into \"the most integrated settings in the community\" or \"least restrictive settings.\" </p><p>According to the DOJ congressional reports filed annually under CRIPA, monitoring of conditions in the covered facilities and community-based settings continued throughout the decade.  In 2008, a \"transition order\" was entered to ensure that Puerto Rico continued making progress on its obligations during the transition of executive authority following the election. In the order, Puerto Rico was required to continue its efforts on a wide number of objectives including job training, medical care access, and payment for services. On August 17, 2009, the District Court ordered the Commonwealth to adequately fund programs and services required by persons with developmental disabilities, as required in the December 2008 Transition Order. In addition, the Court emphasized the need for the Commonwealth to address the vocational needs of such persons by hiring additional job coaches and job promoters, as well as to ensure better programs, services, and protections to persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth.  </p><p>Over the next several years, the Puerto Rican government worked with a Joint Compliance Coordinator and experts in the mental health field to make the changes listed in the previous three orders. On October 19, 2011 the parties adopted a joint compliance plan listing short terms and long-term goals for the mental health programs at issue in the suit. This plan re-affirmed the goals in the Interim Settlement Agreement, the Supplemental Interim Settlement Agreement, and the Community-Based Service Plan. In addition to this, the compliance plan dictated the defendants should re-evaluate and re-work many of their policies about patient transportation, health care, mental health care, and should work to place patients into integrated community residential settings. </p><p>In 2012, the Puerto Rican government went through a change in administration due to their gubernatorial election. The court, concerned that this change in administration may halt the efforts the Commonwealth was making toward improving their services for those with developmental disabilities, issued a supplemental transition order on November 11th of that year. This order re-affirmed past order from the court and reminded the commonwealth government to continue to provide the ordered services. After the 2016 gubernatorial election, the court did this again, issuing a second supplemental transition order on March 22, 2016.</p><p>Puerto Rico requested that the court monitor enter into a contract with the government of Puerto Rico, but the request was denied by Judge Gelpí in an order on June 27, 2014. The court was concerned that having the monitor in contract with the government of Puerto Rico would undermine the monitor's independence. The CRIPA congressional reports then show continued monitoring through 2014, the last one of them available.</p><p>Over the next two years, the court became concerned that Puerto Rico was neglecting to provide funding to community providers serving individuals with developmental disabilities. The court issued a remedial order on May 11, 2016 ordering Puerto Rico to provide “full base payments” to all these providers within 35 days. </p><p>Since 2016, the Commonwealth continued to pay tens of thousands of dollars to the Joint Compliance Coordinator, experts, and community providers of services to individuals with developmental disabilities. As of March 2019, this case was ongoing.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "Case 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1306  Filed 12/12/12  Page 1 of4 \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n) \nv.  )  Civ. No. 99 - 1435 (GAG) \n) \nTHE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO,  ) \net aZ.,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n) \nORDER APPOINTING \nA SUCCESSOR JOINT COMPLIANCE COORDINATOR AND ASSISTANT TO THE \nJOINT COMPLIANCE COORDINATOR \nSeveral weeks ago, John J. McGee, Ph.D., the Conrt-appointed Joint Compliance \nCoordinator (\"JCC\") in this case, passed away rather unexpectedly.  Dr. McGee had served as \nthe JCC since almost the beginning of this case.  He served the Conrt, the parties, and people \nwith disabilities with great distinction and integrity, bringing his considerable compassion, \ninsight, and humanity to the day-to-day work of monitoring the Commonwealth's efforts to \ncomply with existing orders in this case.  During his time as the JCC, Dr. McGee played a \ncritical role in helping to bring about meaningful and positive change that deeply impacted \ncountless vulnerable and often voiceless people with disabilities; the action taken to create an \nintegrated community-based service delivery system to replace an archaic and bleak institutional \nsystem is perhaps his greatest legacy. \nAlthough he can never be replaced, it is necessary to appoint a successor to continue his \nimportant oversight work associated with the ongoing efforts to ensure the health, safety, and \nwelfare of persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1306  Filed 12/12/12  Page 2 of4 \n2 \nA short time ago, the Court appointed Sylvia M. Fernandez Colorado, Ph.D., as the \nsuccessor JCC.  Order, Nov. 27, 2012, Doc. No. 1300.  In addition to her considerable \nindependent professional credentials, Dr. Fernandez is, as referenced in that minute order, \nuniquely and best qualified for the post given that, for the past two years, she had worked closely \nwith, and under the tutelage of, Dr. McGee as his assistant in monitoring the Commonwealth's \nefforts to comply with tlie various Court orders in this case.  See Order Appointing Assistant to \nCourt Monitor, Oct. 29,2010, Doc. No. 1049. \nAs referenced in the minute order, Dr. Fernandez is to immediately assume all of Dr. \nMcGee's duties as JCC and she shall have the same JCC authority conferred upon her as set \nforth in prior orders, including the Supplemental Interim Settlement Agreement, originally filed \non April 14, 2000 (Doc. No. 15). \nConsistent with existing orders in this case, the Court expects the Commonwealth to \nwork cooperatively with Dr. Fernandez at all tinJ:es,by facilitating the JCC's access to all \npersons, residences, facilities, programs, services, documents, and materials the JCC deems \nnecessary or appropriate to consult or utilize in performing the duties and functions ofthe JCC. \nTo that end, the Commonwealth shall provide the JCC with requested documents and other \nmaterials promptly, so as to enable the JCC to conduct reviews, to conduct interviews, and to \nissue reports in a timely manner. \nIn addition, the Commonwealth shall proactively provide the JCC with prompt notice of \nsentinel events, including:participantdeaths;~sychiatric hospitalizations, clinical \nhospitalizations and hospital visits, allegations of abuse, allegations of neglect, participant \ninjuries (such as fractures, lacerations, or bruises), significant participant behaviors (such as \naggression to staff, aggression to peers, self-injurious behavior, elopement attempts, pica, and \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1306  Filed 12/12/12  Page 3 of4 \n3 \nsexually-inappropriate behavior), use of physical, mechanical, or chemical restraint, the onset of \nWlY \ndecubitus ulcers, as well as details on  and all igdividual transitions and the closure or \nopening of any community residence. \nAs has been the practice for many months now, the Court anticipates receiving monthly \nreports from the JCC with regard to outstanding issues associated with the delivery of \nprotections, services, and supports to all persons with developmental disabilities in the \nCommonwealth's service-delivery system.  So as to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of \nthese persons and to minimize any substantive disputes between the parties, the Court expects \nthe Commonwealth to develop and implement prompt and effective remedial measures to \naddress any and all legitimate concerns set forth in the monthly JCC reports. \nIn addition, also consistent with existing' :orders in this case, the Commonwealth shall \nrcc \ncontinue to promptly reimburse the  for time spent on monitoring activities, as well as for \nreasonable associated expenses and the expense of assistants and consultants, if any.  The Court \ninstructs Dr. Fernandez to submit invoices for her work as JCC at the same $150.00/hour rate \npreviously set for Dr. McGee as JCC.  TheCouli notes that because Dr. Fernandez resides in \nPuerto Rico, the Commonwealthwill now not be billed for local rental car or U.S. travel \nexpenses typically associated with Dr. McGee's past visits to the island. \nConsistent with prior practice, the Court will authorize and direct payment from the Court \nRegistry for all reasonable invoices that the JCC'files with the Court.  To lhinimize the Court \nhaving to issue orders associated with the Court Registry account, the Commonwealth shall \nproactively replenish the funds in the Court Registry so as to ensure that there will always be \nsufficient funds available to meet JCC-invoiced expenses. \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1306  Filed 12/12/12  Page 4 of 4 \n4 \nAfter receiving input from Dr. Fernandez, the Court hereby appoints Dimaris Garcia \nMercado, Psy.D., as the assistant to the JCC.  The duties and responsibilities of this assistant \nshall be consistent with those set forth in the Court's previous order appointing an assistant to the \nJCC (Doc. No. 1049). \nSo ordered. \nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, on this 12th day of December, 2012. \ns/Gustavo A. Gelpi \nGustavo A. Gelpi \nUnited States District Judge ",

The court\npreviously denied such request in camera, noting that the JCC works for the court and\nnot the parties, notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth periodically deposits\nfunds with the Clerk of court to cover the JCC's court approved budget. Also, the\ncourt found it troubling to fathom that the JCC is under a contract with the\nCommonwealth, when the JCC works for the court; this is the equivalent of the court\ncontracting with the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding the court's ruling, the court\nwill promptly address the request for reconsideration. The United States shall respond\nto this motion by 6/16/14. In the same, the United States shall express its position.\nAlso, it shall inform if in any similar cases involving federal monitors these are under\ncontract with the state. The commonwealth in turn, shall on or before 6/5/14 advise in\nwhich other federal cases in this District the monitor is under contract with the\nCommonwealth. Finally, the court notes that this is the first time in 14 years that the\nparties to this case are litigating any matter via motion.

(Castellanos−Bayouth, Alfredo) (Entered: 04/22/2016)\n04/22/2016 1825  ORDER: The Commonwealth's motion (Docket No. 1819 ), as well as USA and the\nJCC's motions (Docket Nos. 1823 ; 1824 ) are all NOTED. Much to my chagrin, the\nCommonwealth's motion leaves very little alternative than for the Court to issue a\ngarnishment order in order to pay the providers immediately. This appears to be the\nonly manner in which the constitutional rights of the special needs population in this\ncase −− stemming back to 1999 −− can indeed be protected. Otherwise, the effect to\nthese individuals will be devastating and beyond repair. Accordingly, all parties shall\nbe available for an emergency conference on Wednesday, April 27th at 10:00 am to\ndiscuss this matter in camera with the JCC's legal counsel. The following\nCommonwealth officials MUST attend: Hon. Cesar Miranda, Attorney General, Hon.\nJuan Zaragoza, Secretary of Treasury, Hon Ana Rius, M.D., Secretary of Health, and\nMr. Luis Cruz, Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The undersigned\nhopes that in this meeting the matter will be ultimately resolved, and thus, the Court\nwill not be in the utterly uncomfortable position of having to take affirmative action in\nregards of the depleted Commonwealth coffers. The parties are invited to be as\ncreative as possible, as the Health Department has successfully done with recent\npayments in the \"330 centers\" litigation. See Rio Grande Comm. Heal. v.\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico (03−cv−01640−GAG). If the parties are unable to\nresolve the matter, they are advised that the undersigned will open Court and enter all\nnecessary orders, short and long term. If the parties agree to another date and time\nduring the week they may request a rescheduling, but in no event can the matter be\nleft unaddressed by next week. Signed by Judge Gustavo A.

(COL) (Entered: 08/10/2016)\n08/10/2016 1901  INFORMATIVE Motion regarding the Secretary of Health's limited participation on\nthe August 11th hearing, and suggestion filed by Javier Burgos−Ruiz on behalf of The\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico Suggestions in opposition/response due by 8/29/2016\n(Burgos−Ruiz, Javier) (Entered: 08/10/2016)\n08/10/2016 1902  ORDER noted and denied 1901 INFORMATIVE motion. The present hearing in the\nPonce US District Courthouse was set several months ago, and the court's directives\nclearly indicated the importance of the Health Secretary's paricipation during the two\ndays of public hearings. These hearings are devoted in great part to the Down\nSyndrome population and participants. Other topics of the utmost importance will also\nbe covered throughout the period, as indicated in the scheduling order. The JCC has\ntraveled from New Mexico for the hearing, as has counsel for the US Department of\nJustice, attorney Farano. More so, the unsigned, Magistrate Judge Lopez and court\nstaff are all in Ponce, not to mention the several participants and their families, as well\nas deponents, who have also come or will come to Ponce to address the court and also\n\nCase: 3:99-cv-1435   As of: 03/24/2019 11:50 PM AST   135 of 167\nbe heard by the Secretary in this case which dates back to 1999. Excusing the\nSecretary from participating in the hearings is counterproductive to the\nimplementation of the agreements between the Commonwealth and United States, and\nthe best interest of the participants. It also sends the wrong message to the\nparticipants, to wit that the Commonwealth does not care about their needs. In the\nPolice Reform Case before the Court the Superintendent has always been present\nthroughout the entire two days of hearings. And such presence is likewise important\nhere, so that the Secretary can react to, address any matters brought forth, and make\nrecommendations to the court as to what has taken place during the hearings.

CIVIL NO. 99-1435 (GAG)\n6\nCOMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO, et. al.\n7\n   Defendants\n8\nTRANSITION ORDER\n9\nThis is a civil action filed by the United States of America pursuant to the Civil Rights of\n10\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 1980 (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1907, against the Commonwealth of\n11\nPuerto Rico and its officers seeking that the Commonwealth defendants provide to persons with\n12\nmental retardation and other developmental disabilities in their case and custody, the rights,\n13\nprivileges and immunities of the United States Constitution and relevant federal statutes.  See\n14\nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).\n15\nThe Commonwealth defendants have entered and/or adopted various agreements and\n16\ncompliance plans to meet their legal obligations.  On April 30, 1999, the Commonwealth entered\n17\ninto an Interim Settlement Agreement (ISA) between the parties (Docket No. 2).  Thereafter, on\n18\nApril 17, 2000, the Commonwealth adopted the Supplemental Interim Settlement Agreement (SISA) \n19\nthat provided for the designation of a Joint Compliance Coordinator (JCC), Dr. John J. McGee\n20\n(Docket No. 15).  On April 23, 2001, the Commonwealth submitted a comprehensive Community\n21\nBased Service Plan (CBSP), to guide its effort in achieving compliance with Olmstead.  Said Plan\n22\nreceived the endorsement of the United States and was approved by this Court on October 9, 2001\n23\n(Docket Nos. 99 and 105).\n24\nAs a result of these agreements and the CBSP, the Commonwealth has to this date opened\n25\nfifty five (55) community homes and eight (8) developmental centers, and has equally engaged a\n26\nsignificant number of support and direct personnel that are essential to the services being provided\n27\nby to the plaintiff participants in this case by the Commonwealth defendants.\n28\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 794   Filed 12/10/08   Page 2 of 5\n1 CIVIL NO. 99-1435 (GAG) 2\n2 The Court takes judicial notice that on November 4, 2008, a general election was held in the\n3 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that produced a change in the executive branch of government.  As\n4 a result, there will be a new administration, and a new cast of Commonwealth defendants, taking\n5 office on or after January 2, 2009.  As informed by the parties during the last status conference held\n6 on December 8, 2008, there are a number of direct and support contract personnel, whose contracts\n7 will expire on December 21, 2008, by operation of state law, and not for lack of funds. These \n8 positions are fully budgeted until June 30, 2009, with state funds earmarked for this litigation.\n9 At the December 8, 2008 status hearing, the Court expressed its concern regarding the\n10 potential impact the upcoming government administration change may have on the ongoing and\n11 future operations of the Commonwealth’s Mental Retardation Program (“MRP”) and other pertinent\n12 Commonwealth agencies, and on the services provided to participants in this case through them. \n13 The Court wants to ensure the continuity of the protections, supports, and services provided to\n14 participants, that they are not interrupted or diminished, and that any progress and momentum\n15 toward meeting participants’ needs under Olmstead will not be lost.  The Court expressed similar\n16 concerns prior to the last gubernatorial administration change in 2004.  See Court Minutes of\n17 Proceedings, June 10, 2004, at 2.  (Docket No. 336).\n18 In the autumn of 2004, pursuant to the direction from the Court, the parties jointly\n19 collaborated to finalize a work plan that set forth plans and/or action steps that needed to be\n20 undertaken and/or maintained so as to ensure the continuity of protections, supports, and services\n21 to participants.  The Commonwealth filed this work plan with the Court.  See Motion Submitting\n22 Proposed Work Plan (Docket No. 398), Dec. 13, 2004.  Several days later, the United States filed\n23 papers supporting the work plan.  See United States’ Statement in Support of the Continuity Work\n24 Plan (Docket No. 401), Dec. 17, 2004.\n25 Consistent with the language of this earlier initiative, the Court similarly directs the\n26 Commonwealth to keep participants safe and to fully comply with all existing Court Orders in this\n27 case, including the Interim Settlement Agreement (“ISA”), the Supplemental Interim Settlement\n28 Agreement (“SISA”), and the Community-Based Service Plan (“CBSP”).  More specifically, the\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 794   Filed 12/10/08   Page 3 of 5\n1 CIVIL NO. 99-1435 (GAG) 3\n2 Commonwealth shall:\n3 - Provide participants with adequate and appropriate habilitation and\ntraining services in integrated community settings according to the\n4 individualized needs of each participant;\n5 - Continue  important  ongoing  efforts  to  find  employment  and/or\nvocational opportunities for qualified participants, and maintain\n6 employment and vocational opportunities for those participants that\nqualify;\n7\n- Provide necessary habilitation, training, protections, supports, and\n8 services  to  participants  at  the  community-based  Developmental\nCenters;\n9\n- Ensure that participants transitioned to community settings have a\n10 “reliable means of transportation” in order to get to health care and\nother appointments, and to participate in community life,\n11\n- Develop and implement needed supports and services for those\n12 participants that need communication assistance;\n13 - Ensure that participants with a mental illness receive adequate and \nappropriate psychiatric services;\n14\n- Ensure  that  all  participants  are  provided  with  adequate  and\n15 appropriate health care services to meet the individualized needs of\neach participant;\n16\n- Pay providers on time each month for legitimate invoices, and\n17 maintain  the  MRP’s  provider  payment  tracking,  reporting,  and\nfollow-up system;\n18\n- Maintain  the  system  of  integrated  community  homes  and  day\n19 programs to ensure that the participants are placed and served in the\nmost integrated setting;\n20\n- Ensure that all incidents are recorded promptly and fully and ensure\n21 that appropriate serious incidents are investigated thoroughly;\n22 - Ensure  that  appropriate  remedial  measures  are  developed  and\nimplemented in response to incidents and investigations;\n23\n- Maintain and enhance the MRP’s quality assurance system to track\n24 and follow-up on participants and their ongoing needs;\n25 - Emphasize the need to comply with the restraint, seclusion, and time-\nout provisions in the CBSP;\n26\n- Maintain service mediators for all participants;\n27\n- Ensure that service mediators identify unmet needs and develop,\n28 implement, and oversee remedial measures based on participant\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 794   Filed 12/10/08   Page 4 of 5\n1 CIVIL NO. 99-1435 (GAG) 4\n2 needs;\n3 - Identify ways to make daily activities, habilitation, training, and\nprogramming services meaningful for participants;\n4\n- Keep the funds in the Court Registry replenished so as to enable\n5 prompt payments to the Joint Compliance Coordinator after the\nsubmission of acceptable invoices;\n6\n- Explore  how  to  develop  and  implement  measures  to  meet  the\n7 requirements  contained  within  the  CBSP’s  “Family  Support\nProgram”, including the family subsidy program and the respite care\n8 program;\n9 - Explore how to establish a self-advocacy program for participants\nand an independent guardianship office to ensure that participants are\n10 participating in a meaningful way with regard to important life\ndecisions;\n11\n- Work with the JCC to develop and implement a compliance action\n12 plan for outstanding areas; and \n13 - Work with “J.C.” to develop and implement a short-term safety plan\nfor this participant.\n14\nThe Court also has a strong interest in ensuring that the continuity and integrity of the\n15\nprotections, supports, and services provided to participants not be compromised by the termination\n16\nof  essential  personnel.    Pursuant  to  local  law,  when  there  is  a  change  in  gubernatorial\n17\nadministrations, Commonwealth contracts automatically terminate at the end of the calendar year\n18\nbefore the inauguration of the new Governor - in this case, on December 31, 2008.  The Court\n19\nunderstands that this will impact certain contractors who provide essential protections, supports, and\n20\nservices to participants as required by existing Court Orders in this federal case.  Given the\n21\nCommonwealth Health Department’s earmarked budget for this case (in excess of $40,000,000.00)\n22\nthe Court further understands that there should be sufficient funds to pay these contractors through\n23\nthe end of the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, 2009.\n24\nGiven the essential function of these contractors, the Court hereby ORDERS the\n25\nCommonwealth Health Department to retain the services of all contract employees within the\n26\nMental Retardation Program until further order of the Court.  At the same time, the Court\n27\nalso ORDERS the Commonwealth Health Department as of this moment not to hire any\n28\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 794   Filed 12/10/08   Page 5 of 5\n1 CIVIL NO. 99-1435 (GAG) 5\n2 employees  (contract  or  otherwise)  for  the  Mental  Retardation  Program  until  the  new\n3 administration is sworn-in.  Specifically, the Court notes that there are twenty four (24) job\n4 coach positions which need to be filled and are essential to continued success of the program. \n5 The Directives set forth in this order should not be interpreted as creating any vested interest\n6 for the incumbents in any of the positions within the Mental Retardation Program.  To the contrary,\n7 the Court recognizes that the incoming administration must be allowed to exercise its widest\n8 discretion, so long as the needs and services to the program participants are duly met under\n9 Olmstead.\n10 Upon motion by the Commonwealth, filed after January 2, 2009, the Court will consider any\n11 request to modify, amend or vacate any of the directives contained in this order.\n12 The Secretary of Health, the Honorable John V. Rullán, is hereby ORDERED to\n13 deliver copy of this order to the members of the transition committee for the incoming\n14 administration during the Health Department transition meeting.\n15 SO ORDERED.\n16 In San Juan, Puerto Rico this 10th day of December, 2008.\n17\n18 S/Gustavo A.

Box 82  \nLa Fortaleza, San Juan, PR 00901  \n  \nRe: Centro de Reeducacion para Adultos in Bayamon, Centro de Servicios Multiples \nRosario Bellber in Aibonito, Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio in Cayey, Hogar de Grupo \nLas Mesas in Mayaguez, and Centro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes in Aguadilla \nDear Governor Rossello: \nOn June 11, 1997, we notified you, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1997, that we were initiating an investigation of conditions at the Centro de Reeducacion para \nAdultos in Bayamon (\"Bayamon\"), Centro de Servicios Multiples Rosario Bellber in Aibonito \n(\"Aibonito\"), Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio in Cayey (\"Cayey\"), Hogar de Grupo Las Mesas in \nMayaguez (\"Mayaguez\"), and Centro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes in Aguadilla (\"Aguadilla\"). \nFrom September 29 through October 2, 1997, we conducted an investigative tour of the facilities \naccompanied by an expert consultant in mental retardation and behavioral psychology. During our \ninvestigation, we toured each facility, interviewed Department of Health officials, facility administrators \nand staff, spoke with residents, and reviewed pertinent documents. As you may recall, earlier in the year, \nwe completed our investigation of the Centro Servicios Integrales in Caimito, and we issued our \nfindings regarding that facility on June 11, 1997.  \n   \nThe five mental retardation facilities in Bayamon, Cayey, Aibonito, Mayaguez and Aguadilla referenced \nabove, are all state-operated residential facilities, and in total, they serve approximately 103 individuals \nwith varying levels of mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. Most of the residents \nhave mental illness and maladaptive behaviors and some have physical disabilities. Bayamon serves 24 \nadult clients (17 men and 7 women), ranging in age from 22 to 50; two-thirds of the clients have severe \nor profound retardation and one-third have mild or moderate retardation. The facility is located on one \nfloor of an old building on a largely abandoned medical facility campus on the outskirts of San Juan. \nThe Commonwealth is renovating another building on campus to house the clients that is scheduled to \nbe finished next year. Cayey serves 15 adult male clients in a one-building facility that was renovated in \n1990. The clients range in age from 23 to 61; facility records did not provide sufficient documentation \nof the functional levels of all the clients, but with a few notable exceptions, most appeared to be mildly \nor moderately retarded. Aibonito serves 24 children (14 boys and 10 girls) ranging in age from 6 to 20; \nall of the children have severe or profound retardation. The facility is located in the foothills of the \nmountainous region of the central part of the island near the local town. The facility's campus includes \none building that serves as the residence with an anteroom kitchen and dining room, and an adjacent \nschool with three distinct classrooms. Mayaguez serves 18 adult clients (10 women and 8 men) ranging \nin age from 24 to 58; virtually all of the clients are listed as having severe or profound retardation. The \none-building facility is small and cramped, located just off a noisy, busy mountain road near town. The \nCommonwealth plans to move these clients to one floor of the local hospital in the near future. \nAguadilla serves 22 clients (8 men, 6 boys, 4 women, and 4 girls) ranging in age from 6 to 28; \napproximately half of the clients are mildly or moderately retarded and the other half are severely or \nprofoundly retarded. The campus compound is located on the outskirts of town and is surrounded by a \nhigh chain-link fence and barbed wire. There are two buildings housing clients and one large \nadministration complex.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 2of 11\nConsistent with our prior investigation of the facility in Caimito, in investigating the five additional \nmental retardation facilities, we evaluated whether residents were being afforded their constitutional and \nfederal statutory rights. All residents of state-operated mental retardation facilities have a Fourteenth \nAmendment due process right to adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, reasonably safe \nconditions, and training. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). In addition, the Commonwealth \nmust provide public services to individuals with disabilities that represent the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs. See, e.g., Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ \n794 et seq. and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; and the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B). Further, the Commonwealth must provide services and \nprograms that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. See 28 C.F.R. § \n35.150.  \n   \nConsistent with statutory requirements, we are now writing to inform you of the findings of our \ninvestigation of the five mental retardation facilities. During our tour, we found numerous conditions \nthat violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of residents. A major cause of many of these \ndeficiencies is that the Commonwealth has not devoted adequate resources to provide essential services \nand safe conditions to the residents. In particular, each facility has an insufficient number of adequately \ntrained staff across all disciplines, including doctors, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, therapy and \nactivity staff, and direct care staff to meet the needs of residents. The facts that support our findings of \nunlawful and unconstitutional conditions at each facility are set forth below along with the remedial \nactions that we believe are necessary to remedy these conditions.  \n   \nI. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHELTER AND \nREASONABLE SAFETY TO RESIDENTS  \n   \nIndividuals residing in a state-operated institution have a fundamental Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess right to adequate shelter and reasonably safe conditions of confinement. Youngberg v. Romeo, \n457 U.S. 307 (1982). However, the Commonwealth fails to afford residents these rights.  \n   \nTo begin with, all of the facilities, with the exception of Aibonito, have structural and environmental \ndeficiencies that pose serious risks of harm and do not provide adequate shelter to the individuals who \nlive there. Many of the buildings are dilapidated, decaying, and lack adequate plumbing and lighting. \nFor example, for years now, the facility at Bayamon has not had sufficient water pressure to provide \nadequate running water for the clients. As a result, the showers do not work, the faucets do not work, \nand the toilets do not flush properly. In order to bathe the clients, staff dump water from water tanks into \nlarge movable garbage cans from which the staff manually extract water using smaller buckets to pour it \non the residents. The Commonwealth has been aware of this unacceptable condition for years but did not \ntake any steps to remedy it until our recent tour when officials announced that they would move \nresidents at some point next year to another building that was being renovated. In the interim, the lack of \nrunning water poses a host of health hazards. For example, many of the Bayamon clients require diapers \nand regular diaper changes by staff; without running water, the staff cannot wash their hands sufficiently \nto maintain aseptic conditions. In addition to the plumbing problems at Bayamon, the overall physical \nstructure of the building is old and dilapidated. The bathrooms are mildewed with cracked and missing \ntiles and exposed pipes and metal objects.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 3of 11\nThe other facilities face similar problems. At Cayey, the roof leaks whenever it rains, creating large wet \nspots all over the facility floor and posing slippery, hazardous conditions for the residents who walk \nover the wet spots. This problem has persisted for many months without repair. In addition, one of the \nfew toilets available to residents has not worked for a prolonged period of time, and the showers do not \ndrain properly, creating additional slippery conditions. One client recently fractured his arm in a fall due \nto the water back-up. Mayaguez also has suffered from chronic and ongoing water pressure problems \nover the years and the roof leaks. In addition, the one-building facility at Mayaguez is physically too \nsmall to accommodate the number of clients it presently serves. In fact, it was designed to serve fewer \nthan half the number of clients currently residing there. As a result, the bathroom and shower facilities \nare inadequate to meet the clients' needs and the bedroom areas are very cramped and overcrowded. At \nAguadilla, one of the residential units is also seriously overcrowded, with about twice as many clients as \nit was designed to serve.  \n   \nAt all five facilities, the Commonwealth fails to provide sufficient direct care staff to protect clients \nfrom harm from self-injurious behavior or the aggression of other clients. Direct care staff absences are \nroutine at every facility we visited and exacerbate the problem of inadequate staffing patterns. The \nstaffing problems are particularly serious at Bayamon where there is sometimes only one direct care \nstaff person on duty on a given shift. It is also common for Cayey to operate with only half its normal \ncomplement of workers on any given shift. In addition, a sizable number of clients at each facility \nrequire constant supervision due to their behaviors. When there are staff shortages, the clients who need \ndirect attention suffer, or the rest of the client population suffers, or both. Each facility director showed \nus evidence of unmet, repeated requests they had made to the Department of Health and the Office of \nMental Retardation for additional staff to meet the basic needs of clients. The one exception to these \nstaffing shortages was at Aibonito where the children attend school in classrooms that are staffed with at \nleast one teacher, one or two teacher's aides, and additional direct care staff for each group of seven or \neight clients. However, as is the case with the other facilities, direct care staff absenteeism in the \nresidential units is a problem at Aibonito, compromising client safety and services.  \n   \nIn sum, the facilities are generally unsafe environments for the individuals who live there. The \nCommonwealth has failed to provide adequate shelter and protect residents from harm, in violation of \ntheir constitutional rights.  \n   \nII. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO PROVIDE ITS RESIDENTS WITH ADEQUATE \nPSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SERVICES AND TRAINING PROGRAMS OR \nWITH PROPER PSYCHIATRIC CARE AND SERVICES  \n   \nA. Psychological and Behavioral Services and Restraints  \n   \nIndividuals residing in a state-operated institution have a Fourteenth Amendment due process right to \nminimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure their safety and freedom from undue restraint, \nprevent regression, and improve their ability to exercise their liberty interests. Youngberg v. Romeo, \n457 U.S. 307 (1982). The Commonwealth is denying residents in the five facilities their right to \nadequate and appropriate training and related psychological services.  \n   \nMost of the clients have aberrant, maladaptive behaviors, such as self-injurious behavior or aggression, \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 4of 11\nthat pose a risk of harm to themselves and other clients. The Commonwealth fails to provide these \nresidents with professional services to abate or eliminate their maladaptive behaviors and replace them \nwith appropriate, functional alternative behaviors. For example, none of the five facilities has a \npsychologist on staff or even provides contract psychology hours to address clients' maladaptive \nbehaviors. Oscar Cruz, the psychologist within the Commonwealth's Mental Retardation Program, cited \nlack of funding, resources, and expertise for the Commonwealth's chronic failures.  \nAs a result, clients do not receive psychological assessments or behavior programs to address their \nindividualized needs. Moreover, the facilities do not monitor adequately the clients' progress by \ncollecting appropriate client behavioral data, nor are the staff properly trained in how to respond to \nclients' behaviors to ensure clients' safety and the safety of others, and to teach them more appropriate \nbehaviors. In many cases, this lack of proper intervention results in undue restraint of clients. As a \nresult, the clients' maladaptive behaviors are not addressed properly, and the clients suffer from the \nnegative effects of their behaviors.  \n   \nMany clients have been harmed due to the Commonwealth's failures in this regard. At Cayey, Edwin \nR.O. is perhaps the most glaring example of the harm that has resulted from allowing a client with \nmaladaptive behaviors to go untreated for prolonged periods of time. We first observed Edwin sitting on \nthe floor of the Cayey day room moaning to himself. He was wearing a soft helmet that covered his \nentire head. We noticed a stream of blood trickling down his helmet. We were disturbed that none of the \nstaff -- not even the direct care staff member that was charged with observing him on a one-to-one basis \n-- noticed this blood. We asked that the nurse immediately clean and dress his wound. When the nurse \nremoved his helmet, we discovered that Edwin's head had been severely damaged due to years of self-\nabuse and head banging. Edwin had butted and rammed his head into walls and post corners so often \nthat he had pushed back completely his hair and skin on the front half of his head. This hair and skin \nformed a marked ridge in the middle of his head. The bleeding we noticed seemed to come from this \narea.  \n   \nEdwin had just arrived at Cayey in April 1997, after having lived at the Centro Servicios Integrales in \nCaimito (the facility we investigated earlier this year). In spite of his ongoing tendency to injure himself, \nthe tangible injuries that have already stemmed from his self abuse, and the life-threatening nature of his \ncurrent condition, the Commonwealth has failed to provide Edwin with professional psychological or \nbehavioral services both at Caimito and Cayey. The Commonwealth has not provided him with a \npsychology consult, with a behavior program, or with staff properly trained in how to treat his \ndestructive behaviors.  \n   \nAt Cayey, we also met Juan R.O., whose arms were marked with dozens of long, deep scars. We learned \nthat over the years, Juan repeatedly had slit himself with razor blades during various suicide attempts. \nJuan also had been transferred recently to Cayey from the deficient conditions at Caimito. Juan is still at \ntremendous risk of harm due to self-injury, and he is in great need of ongoing, intensive professional \nhelp to address his maladaptive behaviors. Yet, as is the case with Edwin, the Commonwealth has failed \nto provide him with a psychology consult, with a behavior program, or with staff properly trained in \nhow to treat his maladaptive behaviors.  \n   \nAt every facility we visited, we noticed a number of other individuals similarly in need of such intensive \nongoing behavioral services for their maladaptive behaviors who, for years, had received inadequate \nservices from the Commonwealth.  \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 5of 11\n   \nIn addition, with the exception of Aibonito, the Commonwealth does not provide clients with sufficient \ndaily training and activities that would prevent many such maladaptive behaviors from occurring in the \nfirst place. Daily, the clients are herded from one room to another by overextended, untrained staff, who \nfocus on resident control rather than active treatment. None of the facilities provides adequate, ongoing \nactive training and habilitation to clients to teach skills, enhance functioning, promote independence, \nand prevent client regression and deterioration. As a result, the clients remain idle all day long. \nAccording to our expert consultant, this lack of meaningful activity encourages maladaptive behaviors \nstemming from boredom and leads to regression and deterioration.  \n   \nLess than a third of the male clients at Bayamon had been taught to bathe themselves and a large number \nof clients had not been trained to toilet themselves. Only three or four clients at Cayey have been taught \nto bathe themselves. Staff at Aguadilla told us that they do not even attempt to teach the clients to toilet \nthemselves or feed or bathe themselves because they supposedly lack the potential to acquire this skill. \nThis attitude runs counter to generally accepted practice in the field. Many clients who need speech \ntherapy, like Jackeline F.S. at Bayamon, and Jose N. at Aguadilla, do not receive it.  \n   \nRestraints are prevalent at many of the institutions we visited and are related to the lack of behavioral \nprogramming, training, and professional mental health intervention. At Mayaguez, a number of clients \nare restrained for much of the day because the staff do not know how to treat their behaviors properly. \nFor example, staff use a bed sheet to tie client Rosa P.L.'s waist and torso to a bench and to one of the \niron bars at the facility to keep her from walking around the building and engaging in aggressive, \nmaladaptive behaviors such as biting and hitting other clients. Staff tie Nilsa R. up in four-point \nrestraints to her bed for the entire time she is menstruating. The staff claimed that if they did not tie her \nup, she would deeply scratch her face and further injure herself. We noticed Nilsa in four-point restraints \nwith additional restraints on both of her hands. Her face was marked with fresh, bloody scratches. While \nwe were in the room with her, Nilsa was crying and moaning and pleading for help. Moreover, \nMayaguez staff place virtually all the sleeping residents in restraints by keeping the bed rails up. We \nwitnessed one client in a hazardous situation because she had caught her leg in-between the bed rails \nwhile trying to emerge from her bed after sleeping. In spite of the obvious potential danger to her limbs, \nthe staff claimed this was her \"normal\" way of communicating to staff that she wanted to be let out of \nbed.  \nAt Aguadilla, a number of clients are placed in restraints every day. For example, staff place Rene L. in \nhand restraints for at least six hours each day to prevent him from gnawing on his fingers and forcing \nhimself to vomit. Staff restrain Jose N. in his bed behind bed rails for most of the day. Jose has cerebral \npalsy, a condition characterized by marked muscular incoordination and speech disturbance. However, \nthe staff failed to realize that Jose is higher functioning than he appears. Not knowing what to do with \nhim, the staff has denied him educational opportunities with his peers and left him to languish in his bed. \nThe physical environment of all of the facilities, with the exception of Aibonito, underscores the \npunitive nature of the facilities, is unduly restrictive, and not conducive to the habilitation of individuals \nwith mental retardation. Most buildings are surrounded by high chain-link fences topped with barbed \nwire; the entrances and exits to the facilities are barred and locked with heavy metal gates; the interior \ncorridors of the buildings are routinely cordoned off by other locked, heavy metal gates. At Aguadilla, \nthe young men's ward was constructed originally as a juvenile detention facility with prison mirrors, iron \nbars on all the windows, iron gates separating the ward from the outside, and heavy metal doors on each \nclient bedroom. Virtually nothing was done to normalize this setting to accommodate the individualized \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 6of 11\nneeds of the clients with developmental disabilities. In contrast, the Aibonito residence is fully \nfunctional, clean and more homelike than any of the other institutions we visited. There is no high chain-\nlink fence with barbed wire surrounding this facility.  \n   \nIn sum, the Commonwealth is not providing clients with minimally adequate behavior and training \nprograms. Its failure to do so has resulted in undue restraint, regression, and injury.  \nB. Psychiatric Care and Services  \n   \nThe Commonwealth fails to provide residents in the five facilities with appropriate psychiatric care and \nservices. Although the vast majority of clients have mental illness, they do not receive a proper \npsychiatric assessment and diagnosis and a treatment plan to address the clients' mental health needs. \nMoreover, there is no formal mechanism to monitor the clients' progress or the effect of psychotropic \ndrugs.  \n   \nInstead, the Commonwealth medicates most of the clients with psychotropic medications to control \nthem and for staff convenience. This practice produces a host of dangers, including needlessly \nmedicating the client where there is no professionally demonstrated need for the medication, needlessly \nsubjecting the client to the risk of medication side effects and, in most cases, failing to treat the client's \nmental illness properly. As a result, the client's mental illness is left untreated, the behaviors continue \nunabated, and the client is unduly medicated with psychotropic drugs.  \n   \nThere is no staff psychiatrist or contract psychiatrist at any Commonwealth mental retardation facility. \nInstead, the Commonwealth retains psychiatrists in the community, who have little or no training in \ntreating clients with mental retardation, on an emergency, ad hoc basis, to provide brief client review, \noften based upon nothing more than cursory, anecdotal information about the client from facility staff. \nThis practice departs substantially from accepted professional standards of care and violates the clients' \nright to receive adequate and appropriate treatment for their mental illness.  \n   \nIII. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO PROVIDE ITS RESIDENTS WITH ADEQUATE \nHEALTH CARE  \n   \nAll residents of state-operated institutional facilities have a Fourteenth Amendment due process right to \nadequate health care. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). Nonetheless, the facilities fail to \nprovide residents with the health care and services they require.  \n   \nNone of the facilities we visited had a physician on staff or a contract physician to meet the health care \nneeds of clients. Instead, the facilities are forced to rely on the ad hoc availability of doctors in the local \ncommunity, usually at a local hospital, to treat the clients. This system has produced poor results in \nterms of meeting clients' health care needs. Some clients do not see a doctor every year for a routine \ncheckup; other clients with more chronic health concerns like diabetes and epilepsy, do not see a doctor \nat appropriate intervals to monitor and treat these conditions. Very few clients with seizure disorders at \nCayey actually get to see a neurologist as frequently as their medical conditions warrant.  \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 7of 11\n   \nSome facilities are well-staffed with nurses, while others are grossly understaffed. At Mayaguez -- \nwhich serves clients who are medically involved such as those with cancer, epilepsy, Hodgkin's disease, \nheart problems, and diabetes -- there are no nurses currently on staff. The Commonwealth's failure in \nthis regard has placed these clients at great risk of harm.  \n   \nThere are residents who need wheelchairs at Aibonito, Mayaguez, and Aguadilla. Still, the \nCommonwealth fails to provide the facilities with funds to purchase and repair wheelchairs. As a result, \nwhen a chair needs to be bought or modified, the facility directors must ask for funds from parents,  \nfamily members, or the private community at large. This delays procuring the chairs or needed \nmodifications and places the clients at risk of harm. Moreover, the Commonwealth fails to furnish the \nclients with professional assessments to determine if their wheelchairs are appropriate. As a result, the \nwheelchairs we observed did not fit most of the clients properly and caused them to slump down in their \nchairs, promoting scoliosis and contractures which compromise client breathing, digestion and overall \nhealth. In fact, we noticed three clients at Mayaguez whose wheelchairs were so inadequate, staff \nresorted to tying them in their chairs in order to keep them from sliding out.  \n   \nThe institutions also are in great need of physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech \ntherapists. This need was particularly acute at Bayamon, Aibonito, Mayaguez and Aguadilla. At \nAibonito, there is a need for speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy, and a need for \nadditional nursing support.  \n   \nMany facilities, notably Aguadilla, Mayaguez and Bayamon, reported deficiencies in providing dental \ncare to the clients. We noticed many clients with missing teeth or poorly cared for teeth during our tours. \n \n   \nIV. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO ENSURE THAT FACILITY RESIDENTS ARE \nBEING SERVED IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING APPROPRIATE TO THEIR \nNEEDS  \n   \nThe Justice Department has promulgated regulations pursuant to the ADA that require public entities to \nserve individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides similar protections. Nonetheless, \nthe Commonwealth has failed to assess each institutionalized client to determine whether the client is \nresiding in the most integrated setting pursuant to the ADA and Section 504.  \n   \nCommonwealth officials and the facility directors agreed that many of the clients currently residing in \nthe institutions are capable of, and would benefit from, placement in a more integrated setting. Our \nexpert consultant found that many of the clients are high-functioning and could move to the community \nimmediately given the proper services and supports.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 8of 11\nFor example, at Aguadilla, Lecet M.G. is 25 years old, has mild retardation, and could function well in a \ncommunity setting. She can speak both Spanish and English, she can write and draw, and she has the \nfull use of her hands, limbs and body. She told us that she would like to live outside the institution \nbecause the Aguadilla staff punish her, often locking her up in her small room. While we were touring \nthe facility, she expressed her dissatisfaction with her current situation by attempting to elope from the \ninstitution by climbing over the barbed wire fence. At Bayamon, Rafael M.V. spoke to us in both \nSpanish and English, and entertained us by singing a medley of songs that he had memorized and \nperformed with perfect execution. Similarly, at Aguadilla, a young male client sang a song he had \nmemorized and danced for us after plugging in his own tape player and inserting the tape. Our expert \nconsultant found that these and other clients exhibited tremendous capacity and potential to function \nmore independently in the community.  \n   \nThe Commonwealth has failed to develop sufficient community services and supports that would enable \nclients like these to transition into a more appropriate environment. The various Commonwealth \ndepartments -- Family, Social Services, Education, Housing, Mental Health, and Health -- have failed to \ncoordinate efforts to make this a reality.  \n   \nAgain, in contrast to the other facilities, Aibonito stresses the importance of the clients' involvement \nwith the community. This facility serves only children and provides residential and educational services \nfor them during the week. Over the years, the director has stressed that the children remain connected \nwith the community and with their families where possible. To that end, he has taken the positive step of \ninsisting that each child return home to his or her family or to a foster family every weekend (from \nFriday afternoon until Sunday afternoon). Moreover, he has actively involved the families in the lives of \ntheir children even when they are residing at the facility. Largely as a result of this, the children we \nobserved in school appeared happy and involved. Nonetheless, the clients are not furnished with an \neducation in an inclusive setting, where appropriate, as required by the IDEA. The facility provides the \nchildren with inclusive activities only about once a month, and they are limited to recreational, extra-\ncurricular activities. Moreover, transportation services are inadequate to drive the clients off-site, \nespecially those clients with physical disabilities.  \n   \nV. MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES  \n   \nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and to protect the rights of the facility residents, the \nCommonwealth should implement promptly, at a minimum, the following measures:  \n   \n1. Safety and Adequate Shelter  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must provide reasonable safety to all facility residents. The Commonwealth must \nensure that residents are provided with sufficient professional and direct care staff and that the residents \nare protected from harm and receive adequate and appropriate services. Moreover, the Commonwealth \nmust provide adequate shelter by ensuring that the physical buildings are properly maintained in good \nworking order, including repairing plumbing systems and leaky roofs and ridding the facilities of other \nenvironmental hazards.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 9of 11\n2. Psychological Services, Training Programs, and Restraints  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must provide adequate behavioral and training programs and needed psychological \nservices. In addition, the Commonwealth should provide an adequate array of comprehensive \nindividualized training programs for residents developed by qualified professionals consistent with \naccepted professional standards to reduce or eliminate risks to personal safety, unreasonable use of \nbodily restraints, prevent regression, and teach residents basic self-care skills. To this end, the \nCommonwealth should conduct a comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluation of each resident to \ndetermine the individual's need for training and psychological services; develop and implement a \nprofessionally based, individually appropriate data collection system to measure relevant information \nabout maladaptive behaviors; have a qualified professional develop and monitor a professionally-based, \nindividualized training program for each resident and teach direct care staff how to implement it; and \nprovide each individual with adequate training. The Commonwealth should procure adequate \npsychology consult hours to meet the needs of the residents. Moreover, the Commonwealth should alter \nthe environment of the facilities to make them less punitive and more conducive to habilitation.  \n   \nIn addition, the Commonwealth must ensure that the residents are not subjected to undue restraint. The \nCommonwealth should ensure that bodily restraints are used only pursuant to accepted professional \nstandards, and that they are never used as punishment, in lieu of training programs, or for the \nconvenience of staff.  \n   \n3. Psychiatric Care  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must provide adequate and appropriate routine and emergency psychiatric and \nmental health services in accordance with accepted professional standards to residents who need such \nservices. The Commonwealth should procure adequate psychiatric consult hours to meet the needs of the \nresidents. Psychotropic medication should only be used in accordance with accepted professional \nstandards and only where a psychiatric diagnosis supports the need for such medication. Psychotropic \nmedication should not be used as punishment, in lieu of a training program or for the convenience of \nstaff. The Commonwealth should conduct a comprehensive assessment of each resident with mental \nillness, develop an appropriate diagnosis and an overall mental health treatment plan for these residents, \nand provide ongoing monitoring of the treatment, including implementing an adequate system for \ndetecting, reporting, and responding to any drug-induced side effects of psychotropic medication. The \nCommonwealth should document that, prior to using psychotropic medication for behavior \nmodification, other, less restrictive techniques have been systematically tried as part of a training \nprogram and have been demonstrated to be ineffective.  \n   \n4. Medical Care  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must ensure that its residents receive adequate preventive, chronic, and emergency \nmedical care in accordance with generally accepted standards of care. To this end, the Commonwealth \nshould provide for comprehensive evaluations of all residents, identify any needed medical services, and \nensure that such services are timely obtained whenever necessary to evaluate or treat the individual's \nmedical problems. In concert with the steps above, the Commonwealth should provide adequate and \nappropriate routine and emergency seizure management to all individuals with epilepsy in accordance \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 10of 11\nwith accepted professional standards of care. The Commonwealth should provide the full range of \ntherapy services to meet the clients' needs, including physical, occupational and speech therapy.  \n   \n5. Nursing Care  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must ensure that its residents receive adequate nursing care. To this end, the \nCommonwealth should ensure that there are a sufficient number of nurses to perform their \nresponsibilities in keeping with accepted professional standards of care by adequately identifying health \ncare problems, notifying physicians of health care problems, monitoring and intervening to ameliorate \nsuch problems, and keeping appropriate records of residents' health care status.  \n   \n6. Wheelchairs  \n   \nThe Commonwealth should provide the clients who need wheelchairs with appropriate wheelchairs that \nmeet their individualized needs, as well as appropriate professional assessments and reassessments to \nensure that the wheelchairs fit the clients properly.  \n   \n7. Most Integrated Setting  \n   \nAppropriate professionals should evaluate each resident to determine whether the resident is being \nserved in the most integrated setting appropriate to the resident's needs. Where professionals determine \nthat a resident should be served in a more integrated setting, the Commonwealth should identify \nappropriate services and take reasonable steps to reallocate resources to meet the resident's needs. The \nCommonwealth should develop appropriate time lines for placing these residents in the community and \ndevelop and implement an adequate system to monitor the adequacy of community placements.  \n   \n8. Recordkeeping and Staffing  \n   \nThe Commonwealth should establish and maintain adequate client records to ensure adequate and \nappropriate care, services and quality assurance for each resident at the facility. The Commonwealth \nshould ensure that a sufficient number of professional and non-professional staff, including outside \nconsultants, are employed to meet the needs of the residents. The Commonwealth should ensure that the \nstaff is adequately trained to perform its duties.  \n   \n \n* * * \n \n   \n \nWe hope to be able to resolve this matter amicably and cooperatively. Nonetheless, the Attorney \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 11of 11\nGeneral may initiate a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA to correct deficiencies at an institution or otherwise to \nprotect the rights of its residents 49 days after receipt of this letter. 42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1).

No. 99 - 1435 (GAG) \n) \nTHE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO,  ) \n) \net~, \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n) \nSUPPLEMENTAL TRANSITION ORDER \n1.  Background \nSince the inception of this case, the Court has issued a number of different orders to \nensure that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico provides effective protections, services, and \nsupports to meet the individualized needs of persons with developmental disabilities in the \nCommonwealth's service-delivery system.  The Court has appointed a Joint Compliance \nCoordinator (\"JCC\"), and an assistant, to monitor the Commonwealth's compliance with the \nterms ofthe various orders, to work with the parties to minimize disputes, and to keep the focus \non the Commonwealth developing and implementing measures to ensure the health, safety, and \nwelfare ofpersons with developmental disabilities. \nIn recent years, in collaboration with the Court, the JCC, and the United States, the \nCommonwealth has taken steps to shift from an institutional model to a more integrated \ncommunity-based model of service-delivery.  These integration efforts are not only required by \ncertain orders in this case, they are also consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1299  Filed 11/12/12  Page 2 of 5 \n2 \nentities, as well as the Supreme Court's ADA decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581,597 \n(1999), where the Court held that \"[u]njustified isolation ... is properly regarded as \ndiscrimination based on disability.\" \nFor a more complete summary and description of the existing legal framework in this \ncase, see the background section of the parties' Joint Compliance Action Plan, entered as an \norder of the Court on October 19, 2011 (Docket No. 1185-1). \nII.  Need for Transition Order Protections \nAround the time ofthe last gubernatorial election in 2008, the Court issued a Transition \nOrder, with specific language intended to minimize or eliminate the potential adverse impact the \ngovernment administration change could have on the ongoing and future operations of the \nCommonwealth's Mental Retardation Program (\"MRP\") and other pertinent Commonwealth \nagencies, and on the essential services provided to persons with developmental disabilities \nthrough them.  Transition Order, Dec. 10,2008 (Docket No. 794).  Specifically, the Court's 2008 \nTransition Order contained provisions that, among other things, prevented the automatic \ntermination of contract personnel that provided needed protections, services, and supports to \npersons with developmental disabilities. \nThe Court remains concerned that, pursuant to local law, when there is a change in \ngubernatorial administrations, Commonwealth contracts automatically terminate at the end of the \ncalendar year before the inauguration of the newly-elected Governor.  Without a properly crafted \nTransition Order to ensure continuity, key contractors in the instant case would be terminated \nwithout sufficient, or any, consideration of the potentially dire consequences to the persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities who need the protections, services, and supports these contractors \nprovide.  Moreover, it could be weeks or months before officials in the new administration are \n\nCase 3:99\"cv-01435-GAG  Document 1299  Filed 11/12/12  Page 3 of 5 \n3 \nable to contract with andlor hire replacement personnel; in the interim, persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities would be vulnerable to not having their needs met and this could \nviolate existing orders in this case.  The Court notes that this is typically not a money issue - in \n2008, for example, there were sufficient budgeted funds to pay these contractors beyond the end \nof the calendar year and through the end ofthe fiscal year, which was six months into the \nadministration of the new Governor. \nIII.  Supplemental Transition Order \nThe 2012 gubernatorial election results in Puerto Rico have produced a change in \nadministrations that will prompt the automatic termination of contract employees as referenced \nabove.  As in 2008, the Court has a similar interest in mitigating circumstances associated with \nthe gubernatorial election that might impede the nninterrupted delivery of needed protections, \nservices, and supports to persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth's \nservice-delivery system.  Therefore, the Court is issuing today a Supplemental Transition Order, \nset forth below, to reinforce the importance of the safeguards set forth in the initial Transition \nOrder and to update certain provisions, as appropriate. \nA. \t The Court's 2008 Transition Order (Docket No. 794) shall remain in fnll force and \neffect to protect persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth's \nsystem from destabilizing influences that could imperil their health, safety, and \nwelfare. \nB. \t Consistent with the 2008 Transition Order and subsequent Court orders related to \nmaintaining the MRP budget, the Commonwealth shall:  ensure the continuity and \nintegrity of the protections, services, and supports provided to persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities in the Commonwealth's service-delivery system; ensure \nthat these protections, services, and supports are not interrupted or dinunished; and \nensure that any progress and momentum toward meeting the needs of these persons \nwith developmental disabilities will not be lost. \nC. \t The Commonwealth presently engages a significant number of contract personnel to \nprovide needed protections, services, and supports to persons with developmental \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1299  Filed 11/12/12  Page 4 of 5 \n4 \ndisabilities in the Commonwealth's service-delivery system.  As in 2008, the Court \ncontinues to have a strong interest in ensuring that the continuity and integrity of \nneeded protections, services, and supports not be compromised by the automatic \ntermination of these contract personnel after the election and before the inauguration \nof a new Governor. \nD. \t Given the essential function ofthese contractors, the Court hereby orders the \nCommonwealth Department of Health to retain the services of all contract employees \nthat provide protections, services, and supports to persons with developmental \ndisabilities within the Commonwealth's service-delivery system, until further order of \nthe Court. \nE. \t The Commonwealth shall ensure that there are sufficient funds to pay these \ncontractors beyond the end of the 2012 calendar year and through the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year, which ends on June 30, 2013. \nF. \t The provisions of this order should not be interpreted as creating any vested interest \nfor the incumbents in any of the positions within the Commonwealth Department of \nHealth.  To the contrary, the Court recognizes that the incoming administration must \nbe allowed to exercise its widest discretion, so long as the incoming administration \ncomplies with existing orders of the Court to provide needed protections, services, \nand supports to ensure the health, safety, and welfare ofpersons with developmental \ndi~abi1itie~ in the Commonwea1th'~ service-delivery system. \nG. \t Upon motion by the Commonwealth, filed after the inauguration of the new Governor \non January 02, 2013, the Court will consider any request to modifY, amend, or vacate \npertinent provisions, as appropriate. \nH. \t The Commonwealth Secretary ofHealth is hereby ordered to deliver a copy of this \norder to the members ofthe transition committee for the incoming administration \nduring the Department of Health transition meetings. \nPrior to the next status hearing in this case on December 5, 2012, the JCC and the parties \nshall collaborate, and then inform the Court if necessary, on the need for additional provisions to \nbetter ensure the continuity and integrity of the protections, services, and supports provided to \npersons with developmental disabilities during and after the time of transition. \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1299  Filed 11/12/12  Page 5 of 5 \n5 \nSo ordered. \n\nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, on this 12th day ofNovember, 2012. \n\ns/Gustavo A.

      "text": "Puerto Rican facilities Page 1of 11\nThe Honorable Pedro J. Rossello  \nGovernor of Puerto Rico  \nGovernor's Office  \nP.O. Box 82  \nLa Fortaleza, San Juan, PR 00901  \n  \nRe: Centro de Reeducacion para Adultos in Bayamon, Centro de Servicios Multiples \nRosario Bellber in Aibonito, Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio in Cayey, Hogar de Grupo \nLas Mesas in Mayaguez, and Centro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes in Aguadilla \nDear Governor Rossello: \nOn June 11, 1997, we notified you, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1997, that we were initiating an investigation of conditions at the Centro de Reeducacion para \nAdultos in Bayamon (\"Bayamon\"), Centro de Servicios Multiples Rosario Bellber in Aibonito \n(\"Aibonito\"), Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio in Cayey (\"Cayey\"), Hogar de Grupo Las Mesas in \nMayaguez (\"Mayaguez\"), and Centro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes in Aguadilla (\"Aguadilla\"). \nFrom September 29 through October 2, 1997, we conducted an investigative tour of the facilities \naccompanied by an expert consultant in mental retardation and behavioral psychology. During our \ninvestigation, we toured each facility, interviewed Department of Health officials, facility administrators \nand staff, spoke with residents, and reviewed pertinent documents. As you may recall, earlier in the year, \nwe completed our investigation of the Centro Servicios Integrales in Caimito, and we issued our \nfindings regarding that facility on June 11, 1997.  \n   \nThe five mental retardation facilities in Bayamon, Cayey, Aibonito, Mayaguez and Aguadilla referenced \nabove, are all state-operated residential facilities, and in total, they serve approximately 103 individuals \nwith varying levels of mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. Most of the residents \nhave mental illness and maladaptive behaviors and some have physical disabilities. Bayamon serves 24 \nadult clients (17 men and 7 women), ranging in age from 22 to 50; two-thirds of the clients have severe \nor profound retardation and one-third have mild or moderate retardation. The facility is located on one \nfloor of an old building on a largely abandoned medical facility campus on the outskirts of San Juan. \nThe Commonwealth is renovating another building on campus to house the clients that is scheduled to \nbe finished next year. Cayey serves 15 adult male clients in a one-building facility that was renovated in \n1990. The clients range in age from 23 to 61; facility records did not provide sufficient documentation \nof the functional levels of all the clients, but with a few notable exceptions, most appeared to be mildly \nor moderately retarded. Aibonito serves 24 children (14 boys and 10 girls) ranging in age from 6 to 20; \nall of the children have severe or profound retardation. The facility is located in the foothills of the \nmountainous region of the central part of the island near the local town. The facility's campus includes \none building that serves as the residence with an anteroom kitchen and dining room, and an adjacent \nschool with three distinct classrooms. Mayaguez serves 18 adult clients (10 women and 8 men) ranging \nin age from 24 to 58; virtually all of the clients are listed as having severe or profound retardation. The \none-building facility is small and cramped, located just off a noisy, busy mountain road near town. The \nCommonwealth plans to move these clients to one floor of the local hospital in the near future. \nAguadilla serves 22 clients (8 men, 6 boys, 4 women, and 4 girls) ranging in age from 6 to 28; \napproximately half of the clients are mildly or moderately retarded and the other half are severely or \nprofoundly retarded. The campus compound is located on the outskirts of town and is surrounded by a \nhigh chain-link fence and barbed wire. There are two buildings housing clients and one large \nadministration complex.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 2of 11\nConsistent with our prior investigation of the facility in Caimito, in investigating the five additional \nmental retardation facilities, we evaluated whether residents were being afforded their constitutional and \nfederal statutory rights. All residents of state-operated mental retardation facilities have a Fourteenth \nAmendment due process right to adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, reasonably safe \nconditions, and training. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). In addition, the Commonwealth \nmust provide public services to individuals with disabilities that represent the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs. See, e.g., Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ \n794 et seq. and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; and the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B). Further, the Commonwealth must provide services and \nprograms that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. See 28 C.F.R. § \n35.150.  \n   \nConsistent with statutory requirements, we are now writing to inform you of the findings of our \ninvestigation of the five mental retardation facilities. During our tour, we found numerous conditions \nthat violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of residents. A major cause of many of these \ndeficiencies is that the Commonwealth has not devoted adequate resources to provide essential services \nand safe conditions to the residents. In particular, each facility has an insufficient number of adequately \ntrained staff across all disciplines, including doctors, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, therapy and \nactivity staff, and direct care staff to meet the needs of residents. The facts that support our findings of \nunlawful and unconstitutional conditions at each facility are set forth below along with the remedial \nactions that we believe are necessary to remedy these conditions.  \n   \nI. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHELTER AND \nREASONABLE SAFETY TO RESIDENTS  \n   \nIndividuals residing in a state-operated institution have a fundamental Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess right to adequate shelter and reasonably safe conditions of confinement. Youngberg v. Romeo, \n457 U.S. 307 (1982). However, the Commonwealth fails to afford residents these rights.  \n   \nTo begin with, all of the facilities, with the exception of Aibonito, have structural and environmental \ndeficiencies that pose serious risks of harm and do not provide adequate shelter to the individuals who \nlive there. Many of the buildings are dilapidated, decaying, and lack adequate plumbing and lighting. \nFor example, for years now, the facility at Bayamon has not had sufficient water pressure to provide \nadequate running water for the clients. As a result, the showers do not work, the faucets do not work, \nand the toilets do not flush properly. In order to bathe the clients, staff dump water from water tanks into \nlarge movable garbage cans from which the staff manually extract water using smaller buckets to pour it \non the residents. The Commonwealth has been aware of this unacceptable condition for years but did not \ntake any steps to remedy it until our recent tour when officials announced that they would move \nresidents at some point next year to another building that was being renovated. In the interim, the lack of \nrunning water poses a host of health hazards. For example, many of the Bayamon clients require diapers \nand regular diaper changes by staff; without running water, the staff cannot wash their hands sufficiently \nto maintain aseptic conditions. In addition to the plumbing problems at Bayamon, the overall physical \nstructure of the building is old and dilapidated. The bathrooms are mildewed with cracked and missing \ntiles and exposed pipes and metal objects.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 3of 11\nThe other facilities face similar problems. At Cayey, the roof leaks whenever it rains, creating large wet \nspots all over the facility floor and posing slippery, hazardous conditions for the residents who walk \nover the wet spots. This problem has persisted for many months without repair. In addition, one of the \nfew toilets available to residents has not worked for a prolonged period of time, and the showers do not \ndrain properly, creating additional slippery conditions. One client recently fractured his arm in a fall due \nto the water back-up. Mayaguez also has suffered from chronic and ongoing water pressure problems \nover the years and the roof leaks. In addition, the one-building facility at Mayaguez is physically too \nsmall to accommodate the number of clients it presently serves. In fact, it was designed to serve fewer \nthan half the number of clients currently residing there. As a result, the bathroom and shower facilities \nare inadequate to meet the clients' needs and the bedroom areas are very cramped and overcrowded. At \nAguadilla, one of the residential units is also seriously overcrowded, with about twice as many clients as \nit was designed to serve.  \n   \nAt all five facilities, the Commonwealth fails to provide sufficient direct care staff to protect clients \nfrom harm from self-injurious behavior or the aggression of other clients. Direct care staff absences are \nroutine at every facility we visited and exacerbate the problem of inadequate staffing patterns. The \nstaffing problems are particularly serious at Bayamon where there is sometimes only one direct care \nstaff person on duty on a given shift. It is also common for Cayey to operate with only half its normal \ncomplement of workers on any given shift. In addition, a sizable number of clients at each facility \nrequire constant supervision due to their behaviors. When there are staff shortages, the clients who need \ndirect attention suffer, or the rest of the client population suffers, or both. Each facility director showed \nus evidence of unmet, repeated requests they had made to the Department of Health and the Office of \nMental Retardation for additional staff to meet the basic needs of clients. The one exception to these \nstaffing shortages was at Aibonito where the children attend school in classrooms that are staffed with at \nleast one teacher, one or two teacher's aides, and additional direct care staff for each group of seven or \neight clients. However, as is the case with the other facilities, direct care staff absenteeism in the \nresidential units is a problem at Aibonito, compromising client safety and services.  \n   \nIn sum, the facilities are generally unsafe environments for the individuals who live there. The \nCommonwealth has failed to provide adequate shelter and protect residents from harm, in violation of \ntheir constitutional rights.  \n   \nII. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO PROVIDE ITS RESIDENTS WITH ADEQUATE \nPSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SERVICES AND TRAINING PROGRAMS OR \nWITH PROPER PSYCHIATRIC CARE AND SERVICES  \n   \nA. Psychological and Behavioral Services and Restraints  \n   \nIndividuals residing in a state-operated institution have a Fourteenth Amendment due process right to \nminimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure their safety and freedom from undue restraint, \nprevent regression, and improve their ability to exercise their liberty interests. Youngberg v. Romeo, \n457 U.S. 307 (1982). The Commonwealth is denying residents in the five facilities their right to \nadequate and appropriate training and related psychological services.  \n   \nMost of the clients have aberrant, maladaptive behaviors, such as self-injurious behavior or aggression, \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 4of 11\nthat pose a risk of harm to themselves and other clients. The Commonwealth fails to provide these \nresidents with professional services to abate or eliminate their maladaptive behaviors and replace them \nwith appropriate, functional alternative behaviors. For example, none of the five facilities has a \npsychologist on staff or even provides contract psychology hours to address clients' maladaptive \nbehaviors. Oscar Cruz, the psychologist within the Commonwealth's Mental Retardation Program, cited \nlack of funding, resources, and expertise for the Commonwealth's chronic failures.  \nAs a result, clients do not receive psychological assessments or behavior programs to address their \nindividualized needs. Moreover, the facilities do not monitor adequately the clients' progress by \ncollecting appropriate client behavioral data, nor are the staff properly trained in how to respond to \nclients' behaviors to ensure clients' safety and the safety of others, and to teach them more appropriate \nbehaviors. In many cases, this lack of proper intervention results in undue restraint of clients. As a \nresult, the clients' maladaptive behaviors are not addressed properly, and the clients suffer from the \nnegative effects of their behaviors.  \n   \nMany clients have been harmed due to the Commonwealth's failures in this regard. At Cayey, Edwin \nR.O. is perhaps the most glaring example of the harm that has resulted from allowing a client with \nmaladaptive behaviors to go untreated for prolonged periods of time. We first observed Edwin sitting on \nthe floor of the Cayey day room moaning to himself. He was wearing a soft helmet that covered his \nentire head. We noticed a stream of blood trickling down his helmet. We were disturbed that none of the \nstaff -- not even the direct care staff member that was charged with observing him on a one-to-one basis \n-- noticed this blood. We asked that the nurse immediately clean and dress his wound. When the nurse \nremoved his helmet, we discovered that Edwin's head had been severely damaged due to years of self-\nabuse and head banging. Edwin had butted and rammed his head into walls and post corners so often \nthat he had pushed back completely his hair and skin on the front half of his head. This hair and skin \nformed a marked ridge in the middle of his head. The bleeding we noticed seemed to come from this \narea.  \n   \nEdwin had just arrived at Cayey in April 1997, after having lived at the Centro Servicios Integrales in \nCaimito (the facility we investigated earlier this year). In spite of his ongoing tendency to injure himself, \nthe tangible injuries that have already stemmed from his self abuse, and the life-threatening nature of his \ncurrent condition, the Commonwealth has failed to provide Edwin with professional psychological or \nbehavioral services both at Caimito and Cayey. The Commonwealth has not provided him with a \npsychology consult, with a behavior program, or with staff properly trained in how to treat his \ndestructive behaviors.  \n   \nAt Cayey, we also met Juan R.O., whose arms were marked with dozens of long, deep scars. We learned \nthat over the years, Juan repeatedly had slit himself with razor blades during various suicide attempts. \nJuan also had been transferred recently to Cayey from the deficient conditions at Caimito. Juan is still at \ntremendous risk of harm due to self-injury, and he is in great need of ongoing, intensive professional \nhelp to address his maladaptive behaviors. Yet, as is the case with Edwin, the Commonwealth has failed \nto provide him with a psychology consult, with a behavior program, or with staff properly trained in \nhow to treat his maladaptive behaviors.  \n   \nAt every facility we visited, we noticed a number of other individuals similarly in need of such intensive \nongoing behavioral services for their maladaptive behaviors who, for years, had received inadequate \nservices from the Commonwealth.  \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 5of 11\n   \nIn addition, with the exception of Aibonito, the Commonwealth does not provide clients with sufficient \ndaily training and activities that would prevent many such maladaptive behaviors from occurring in the \nfirst place. Daily, the clients are herded from one room to another by overextended, untrained staff, who \nfocus on resident control rather than active treatment. None of the facilities provides adequate, ongoing \nactive training and habilitation to clients to teach skills, enhance functioning, promote independence, \nand prevent client regression and deterioration. As a result, the clients remain idle all day long. \nAccording to our expert consultant, this lack of meaningful activity encourages maladaptive behaviors \nstemming from boredom and leads to regression and deterioration.  \n   \nLess than a third of the male clients at Bayamon had been taught to bathe themselves and a large number \nof clients had not been trained to toilet themselves. Only three or four clients at Cayey have been taught \nto bathe themselves. Staff at Aguadilla told us that they do not even attempt to teach the clients to toilet \nthemselves or feed or bathe themselves because they supposedly lack the potential to acquire this skill. \nThis attitude runs counter to generally accepted practice in the field. Many clients who need speech \ntherapy, like Jackeline F.S. at Bayamon, and Jose N. at Aguadilla, do not receive it.  \n   \nRestraints are prevalent at many of the institutions we visited and are related to the lack of behavioral \nprogramming, training, and professional mental health intervention. At Mayaguez, a number of clients \nare restrained for much of the day because the staff do not know how to treat their behaviors properly. \nFor example, staff use a bed sheet to tie client Rosa P.L.'s waist and torso to a bench and to one of the \niron bars at the facility to keep her from walking around the building and engaging in aggressive, \nmaladaptive behaviors such as biting and hitting other clients. Staff tie Nilsa R. up in four-point \nrestraints to her bed for the entire time she is menstruating. The staff claimed that if they did not tie her \nup, she would deeply scratch her face and further injure herself. We noticed Nilsa in four-point restraints \nwith additional restraints on both of her hands. Her face was marked with fresh, bloody scratches. While \nwe were in the room with her, Nilsa was crying and moaning and pleading for help. Moreover, \nMayaguez staff place virtually all the sleeping residents in restraints by keeping the bed rails up. We \nwitnessed one client in a hazardous situation because she had caught her leg in-between the bed rails \nwhile trying to emerge from her bed after sleeping. In spite of the obvious potential danger to her limbs, \nthe staff claimed this was her \"normal\" way of communicating to staff that she wanted to be let out of \nbed.  \nAt Aguadilla, a number of clients are placed in restraints every day. For example, staff place Rene L. in \nhand restraints for at least six hours each day to prevent him from gnawing on his fingers and forcing \nhimself to vomit. Staff restrain Jose N. in his bed behind bed rails for most of the day. Jose has cerebral \npalsy, a condition characterized by marked muscular incoordination and speech disturbance. However, \nthe staff failed to realize that Jose is higher functioning than he appears. Not knowing what to do with \nhim, the staff has denied him educational opportunities with his peers and left him to languish in his bed. \nThe physical environment of all of the facilities, with the exception of Aibonito, underscores the \npunitive nature of the facilities, is unduly restrictive, and not conducive to the habilitation of individuals \nwith mental retardation. Most buildings are surrounded by high chain-link fences topped with barbed \nwire; the entrances and exits to the facilities are barred and locked with heavy metal gates; the interior \ncorridors of the buildings are routinely cordoned off by other locked, heavy metal gates. At Aguadilla, \nthe young men's ward was constructed originally as a juvenile detention facility with prison mirrors, iron \nbars on all the windows, iron gates separating the ward from the outside, and heavy metal doors on each \nclient bedroom. Virtually nothing was done to normalize this setting to accommodate the individualized \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 6of 11\nneeds of the clients with developmental disabilities. In contrast, the Aibonito residence is fully \nfunctional, clean and more homelike than any of the other institutions we visited. There is no high chain-\nlink fence with barbed wire surrounding this facility.  \n   \nIn sum, the Commonwealth is not providing clients with minimally adequate behavior and training \nprograms. Its failure to do so has resulted in undue restraint, regression, and injury.  \nB. Psychiatric Care and Services  \n   \nThe Commonwealth fails to provide residents in the five facilities with appropriate psychiatric care and \nservices. Although the vast majority of clients have mental illness, they do not receive a proper \npsychiatric assessment and diagnosis and a treatment plan to address the clients' mental health needs. \nMoreover, there is no formal mechanism to monitor the clients' progress or the effect of psychotropic \ndrugs.  \n   \nInstead, the Commonwealth medicates most of the clients with psychotropic medications to control \nthem and for staff convenience. This practice produces a host of dangers, including needlessly \nmedicating the client where there is no professionally demonstrated need for the medication, needlessly \nsubjecting the client to the risk of medication side effects and, in most cases, failing to treat the client's \nmental illness properly. As a result, the client's mental illness is left untreated, the behaviors continue \nunabated, and the client is unduly medicated with psychotropic drugs.  \n   \nThere is no staff psychiatrist or contract psychiatrist at any Commonwealth mental retardation facility. \nInstead, the Commonwealth retains psychiatrists in the community, who have little or no training in \ntreating clients with mental retardation, on an emergency, ad hoc basis, to provide brief client review, \noften based upon nothing more than cursory, anecdotal information about the client from facility staff. \nThis practice departs substantially from accepted professional standards of care and violates the clients' \nright to receive adequate and appropriate treatment for their mental illness.  \n   \nIII. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO PROVIDE ITS RESIDENTS WITH ADEQUATE \nHEALTH CARE  \n   \nAll residents of state-operated institutional facilities have a Fourteenth Amendment due process right to \nadequate health care. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). Nonetheless, the facilities fail to \nprovide residents with the health care and services they require.  \n   \nNone of the facilities we visited had a physician on staff or a contract physician to meet the health care \nneeds of clients. Instead, the facilities are forced to rely on the ad hoc availability of doctors in the local \ncommunity, usually at a local hospital, to treat the clients. This system has produced poor results in \nterms of meeting clients' health care needs. Some clients do not see a doctor every year for a routine \ncheckup; other clients with more chronic health concerns like diabetes and epilepsy, do not see a doctor \nat appropriate intervals to monitor and treat these conditions. Very few clients with seizure disorders at \nCayey actually get to see a neurologist as frequently as their medical conditions warrant.  \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 7of 11\n   \nSome facilities are well-staffed with nurses, while others are grossly understaffed. At Mayaguez -- \nwhich serves clients who are medically involved such as those with cancer, epilepsy, Hodgkin's disease, \nheart problems, and diabetes -- there are no nurses currently on staff. The Commonwealth's failure in \nthis regard has placed these clients at great risk of harm.  \n   \nThere are residents who need wheelchairs at Aibonito, Mayaguez, and Aguadilla. Still, the \nCommonwealth fails to provide the facilities with funds to purchase and repair wheelchairs. As a result, \nwhen a chair needs to be bought or modified, the facility directors must ask for funds from parents,  \nfamily members, or the private community at large. This delays procuring the chairs or needed \nmodifications and places the clients at risk of harm. Moreover, the Commonwealth fails to furnish the \nclients with professional assessments to determine if their wheelchairs are appropriate. As a result, the \nwheelchairs we observed did not fit most of the clients properly and caused them to slump down in their \nchairs, promoting scoliosis and contractures which compromise client breathing, digestion and overall \nhealth. In fact, we noticed three clients at Mayaguez whose wheelchairs were so inadequate, staff \nresorted to tying them in their chairs in order to keep them from sliding out.  \n   \nThe institutions also are in great need of physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech \ntherapists. This need was particularly acute at Bayamon, Aibonito, Mayaguez and Aguadilla. At \nAibonito, there is a need for speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy, and a need for \nadditional nursing support.  \n   \nMany facilities, notably Aguadilla, Mayaguez and Bayamon, reported deficiencies in providing dental \ncare to the clients. We noticed many clients with missing teeth or poorly cared for teeth during our tours. \n \n   \nIV. THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO ENSURE THAT FACILITY RESIDENTS ARE \nBEING SERVED IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING APPROPRIATE TO THEIR \nNEEDS  \n   \nThe Justice Department has promulgated regulations pursuant to the ADA that require public entities to \nserve individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides similar protections. Nonetheless, \nthe Commonwealth has failed to assess each institutionalized client to determine whether the client is \nresiding in the most integrated setting pursuant to the ADA and Section 504.  \n   \nCommonwealth officials and the facility directors agreed that many of the clients currently residing in \nthe institutions are capable of, and would benefit from, placement in a more integrated setting. Our \nexpert consultant found that many of the clients are high-functioning and could move to the community \nimmediately given the proper services and supports.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 8of 11\nFor example, at Aguadilla, Lecet M.G. is 25 years old, has mild retardation, and could function well in a \ncommunity setting. She can speak both Spanish and English, she can write and draw, and she has the \nfull use of her hands, limbs and body. She told us that she would like to live outside the institution \nbecause the Aguadilla staff punish her, often locking her up in her small room. While we were touring \nthe facility, she expressed her dissatisfaction with her current situation by attempting to elope from the \ninstitution by climbing over the barbed wire fence. At Bayamon, Rafael M.V. spoke to us in both \nSpanish and English, and entertained us by singing a medley of songs that he had memorized and \nperformed with perfect execution. Similarly, at Aguadilla, a young male client sang a song he had \nmemorized and danced for us after plugging in his own tape player and inserting the tape. Our expert \nconsultant found that these and other clients exhibited tremendous capacity and potential to function \nmore independently in the community.  \n   \nThe Commonwealth has failed to develop sufficient community services and supports that would enable \nclients like these to transition into a more appropriate environment. The various Commonwealth \ndepartments -- Family, Social Services, Education, Housing, Mental Health, and Health -- have failed to \ncoordinate efforts to make this a reality.  \n   \nAgain, in contrast to the other facilities, Aibonito stresses the importance of the clients' involvement \nwith the community. This facility serves only children and provides residential and educational services \nfor them during the week. Over the years, the director has stressed that the children remain connected \nwith the community and with their families where possible. To that end, he has taken the positive step of \ninsisting that each child return home to his or her family or to a foster family every weekend (from \nFriday afternoon until Sunday afternoon). Moreover, he has actively involved the families in the lives of \ntheir children even when they are residing at the facility. Largely as a result of this, the children we \nobserved in school appeared happy and involved. Nonetheless, the clients are not furnished with an \neducation in an inclusive setting, where appropriate, as required by the IDEA. The facility provides the \nchildren with inclusive activities only about once a month, and they are limited to recreational, extra-\ncurricular activities. Moreover, transportation services are inadequate to drive the clients off-site, \nespecially those clients with physical disabilities.  \n   \nV. MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES  \n   \nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and to protect the rights of the facility residents, the \nCommonwealth should implement promptly, at a minimum, the following measures:  \n   \n1. Safety and Adequate Shelter  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must provide reasonable safety to all facility residents. The Commonwealth must \nensure that residents are provided with sufficient professional and direct care staff and that the residents \nare protected from harm and receive adequate and appropriate services. Moreover, the Commonwealth \nmust provide adequate shelter by ensuring that the physical buildings are properly maintained in good \nworking order, including repairing plumbing systems and leaky roofs and ridding the facilities of other \nenvironmental hazards.  \n   \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 9of 11\n2. Psychological Services, Training Programs, and Restraints  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must provide adequate behavioral and training programs and needed psychological \nservices. In addition, the Commonwealth should provide an adequate array of comprehensive \nindividualized training programs for residents developed by qualified professionals consistent with \naccepted professional standards to reduce or eliminate risks to personal safety, unreasonable use of \nbodily restraints, prevent regression, and teach residents basic self-care skills. To this end, the \nCommonwealth should conduct a comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluation of each resident to \ndetermine the individual's need for training and psychological services; develop and implement a \nprofessionally based, individually appropriate data collection system to measure relevant information \nabout maladaptive behaviors; have a qualified professional develop and monitor a professionally-based, \nindividualized training program for each resident and teach direct care staff how to implement it; and \nprovide each individual with adequate training. The Commonwealth should procure adequate \npsychology consult hours to meet the needs of the residents. Moreover, the Commonwealth should alter \nthe environment of the facilities to make them less punitive and more conducive to habilitation.  \n   \nIn addition, the Commonwealth must ensure that the residents are not subjected to undue restraint. The \nCommonwealth should ensure that bodily restraints are used only pursuant to accepted professional \nstandards, and that they are never used as punishment, in lieu of training programs, or for the \nconvenience of staff.  \n   \n3. Psychiatric Care  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must provide adequate and appropriate routine and emergency psychiatric and \nmental health services in accordance with accepted professional standards to residents who need such \nservices. The Commonwealth should procure adequate psychiatric consult hours to meet the needs of the \nresidents. Psychotropic medication should only be used in accordance with accepted professional \nstandards and only where a psychiatric diagnosis supports the need for such medication. Psychotropic \nmedication should not be used as punishment, in lieu of a training program or for the convenience of \nstaff. The Commonwealth should conduct a comprehensive assessment of each resident with mental \nillness, develop an appropriate diagnosis and an overall mental health treatment plan for these residents, \nand provide ongoing monitoring of the treatment, including implementing an adequate system for \ndetecting, reporting, and responding to any drug-induced side effects of psychotropic medication. The \nCommonwealth should document that, prior to using psychotropic medication for behavior \nmodification, other, less restrictive techniques have been systematically tried as part of a training \nprogram and have been demonstrated to be ineffective.  \n   \n4. Medical Care  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must ensure that its residents receive adequate preventive, chronic, and emergency \nmedical care in accordance with generally accepted standards of care. To this end, the Commonwealth \nshould provide for comprehensive evaluations of all residents, identify any needed medical services, and \nensure that such services are timely obtained whenever necessary to evaluate or treat the individual's \nmedical problems. In concert with the steps above, the Commonwealth should provide adequate and \nappropriate routine and emergency seizure management to all individuals with epilepsy in accordance \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 10of 11\nwith accepted professional standards of care. The Commonwealth should provide the full range of \ntherapy services to meet the clients' needs, including physical, occupational and speech therapy.  \n   \n5. Nursing Care  \n   \nThe Commonwealth must ensure that its residents receive adequate nursing care. To this end, the \nCommonwealth should ensure that there are a sufficient number of nurses to perform their \nresponsibilities in keeping with accepted professional standards of care by adequately identifying health \ncare problems, notifying physicians of health care problems, monitoring and intervening to ameliorate \nsuch problems, and keeping appropriate records of residents' health care status.  \n   \n6. Wheelchairs  \n   \nThe Commonwealth should provide the clients who need wheelchairs with appropriate wheelchairs that \nmeet their individualized needs, as well as appropriate professional assessments and reassessments to \nensure that the wheelchairs fit the clients properly.  \n   \n7. Most Integrated Setting  \n   \nAppropriate professionals should evaluate each resident to determine whether the resident is being \nserved in the most integrated setting appropriate to the resident's needs. Where professionals determine \nthat a resident should be served in a more integrated setting, the Commonwealth should identify \nappropriate services and take reasonable steps to reallocate resources to meet the resident's needs. The \nCommonwealth should develop appropriate time lines for placing these residents in the community and \ndevelop and implement an adequate system to monitor the adequacy of community placements.  \n   \n8. Recordkeeping and Staffing  \n   \nThe Commonwealth should establish and maintain adequate client records to ensure adequate and \nappropriate care, services and quality assurance for each resident at the facility. The Commonwealth \nshould ensure that a sufficient number of professional and non-professional staff, including outside \nconsultants, are employed to meet the needs of the residents. The Commonwealth should ensure that the \nstaff is adequately trained to perform its duties.  \n   \n \n* * * \n \n   \n \nWe hope to be able to resolve this matter amicably and cooperatively. Nonetheless, the Attorney \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007\n\nPuerto Rican facilities Page 11of 11\nGeneral may initiate a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA to correct deficiencies at an institution or otherwise to \nprotect the rights of its residents 49 days after receipt of this letter. 42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1). Therefore, \nwe will contact you soon to discuss any actions you may have taken or intend to take to address the \ndeficiencies we have identified with respect to the five facilities referenced above and at the Centro \nServicios Integrales pursuant to our letter of June 11, 1997. We would like to integrate the remedial \nsteps needed for all six facilities into one agreement to provide system-wide relief at all of the \nCommonwealth's mental retardation facilities.  \n   \nWe look forward to working with you to resolve these matters in a reasonable and practical manner. If \nyou or your staff has any questions, please contact Richard Farano at 202-307-3116.  \n   \nSincerely,  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nIsabelle Katz Pinzler  \nActing Assistant Attorney General  \nCivil Rights Division  \n   \ncc: The Honorable Pedro Pierluisi  \nSecretary  \nPuerto Rico Department of Justice  \nThe Honorable Carmen Feliciano  \nSecretary  \nPuerto Rico Health Department  \nMs. Mercedes Perez Rivera  \nDirector, Centro de Reeducacion para Adultos  \nMs. Ivette Fernandez  \nDirector, Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio  \nMr. Francisco Espada Bernardi  \nDirector, Centro de Servicios Multiples Rosario Bellber  \nMs. Nilsa Curet  \nDirector, Centro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes  \nDirector, Hogar de Grupo Las Mesas  \nGuillermo Gil, Esquire  \nUnited States Attorney  \nDistrict of Puerto Rico  \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/prmrfind.htm 5/15/2007",

The  parties  enter  into  this  Interim Settlement Agreement \nwith  the  understanding  that  this  Interim Settlement  Agreement \nprovides  interim remedial  relief  to  address  the  most  imminent \ndeficient  conditions  and  practices  at  the  institutional \nfacilities  identified below  while  the  Commonwealth  carries  out \nits decision  to  establish a  community-based  service  system plan \nfor  individuals  with  developmental  disabilities. \nB.  This  case  was  instituted by  the  United  States  pursuant \nto  the  Civil  Rights  of  Institutionalized Persons  Act  (\"CRIPA\"), \n42  U.S.C.  §  1997. \nC.

The  United  States  is  authorized  to  institute  this  civil \naction by  42  U.S.C.  §  1997a  and  has  met  all prerequisites  for  the \ninstitution of  this  civil action prescribed by  the  statute. \nF.  The  Defendants.are  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico, \nPedro  J.  Rossello,  Governor  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico, \nDr.  Carmen  Feliciano Vda.  de  Melecio,  Secretary,  Department  of \nHealth,  Jose  de  Leon,  Director,  Mental  Retardation  Program.  All \nindividual Defendants  are  sued  only  in their official  capacities. \nG.  In  1997,  the  United  States  investigated  six Commonwealth \nfacilities:  Centro  Servicios  Integrales  in Rio  Piedras,  Puerto \nRico  (IIRio  Piedras\"),  Centro  Reeducacion Adultos  Minusvalidos  in \nBayamon,  Puerto  Rico  (\"Bayamon\"),  Facilidad de  Cuidado  Intermedio \nin Cayey,  Puerto  Rico  (\"Cayey\"),  Centro  Rosario  Bellber  in \nAibonito,  Puerto  Rico  (\"Aibonito\"),  Centro  Cuidado  Gentil  Las \n( \nMesas  in Mayaguez,  Puerto, Rico  (\"Mayaguez\"),  and  Centro  Servicios \nMultiples  Camaseyes  in Aguadilla,  Puerto  Rico  (\"Aguadilla\"). \nSince  the  time  the  United  States  conducted  its  investigations, \nthe  Commonwealth  moved  the  residents  living  in Rio  Piedras  to \nCentro  de  Servicios  Integrales  para Adultos  con  Retardacion \nMental  (\"CSIARM\")  located  at  the  MEPSI  Medical  Center  in Bayamon, \nPuerto  Rico,  and  moved  the  residents  living  in the  Mayaguez \nfacility  to  the  Mayaguez  Regional  Hospital  Health  Care  Center in \nMayaguez,  Puerto  Rico  (\"Mayaguez  Hospital\").  The  Commonwealth \noperates  CSIARM  but  does  not  own  the  building.  Mayaguez  Hospital \nserves  the  Commonwealth's  residents  pursuant  to  a  contract  with \nthe  Commonwealth.  The  Commonwealth moved  the  residents  living  in \n\" \n- 2  -\nJ \n::J \n-j \n'\\ \n\nCentro  Reeducation Adultos  Minusvalidos  in Bayamon  to  another \nbuilding on  the  same  campus  and  retained  the  same  name  of  the \nfacility.  The  facility  in Bayamon  has  remained  a  state  owned  and \noperated  facility. \nH.  The  Commonwealth  has  responsibility for  the  care  of  and \nservices  provided  to  residents  of  the  aforementioned  facilities \nin Bayamon,  Cayey,  Aibonito  and Aguadilla,  and  at  CSIARM  and \nMayaguez  Hospital  (hereinafter  \"residents\"). \nI.

The  parties  entering \ninto  this  Interim Settlement  Agreement  recognize  these  federal \nrights,  and  for  the  purpose  of  avoiding protracted and \nadversarial  litigation,  agree  to  the  provisions  set  forth  hdrein. \nL.  In entering  into  this  Interim Settlement  Agreement, \nCommonwealth'officials  do  not  admit  any  violation of  law  and  this \nInterim Settlement Agreement  may  not  be  used  as  evidence  of \nliability in any  other  civil proceeding. \nM.  The  provisions  of  this  Interim Settlement  Agreement  are \na  lawful,  fair  and  appropriate  interim resolution of  this  case. \nN.  The  parties  shall  request  that  this  Interim Settlement \nAgreement,  vOluntarily  entered into,  be  entered by  the  United \nStates  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Puerto  Rico  and  be \nenforceable  as  an  order  of  the  Court. \nO.

INTRODUCTION \nIn April 1999, pursuant to the Civil Rights ofInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIP A\"), 42 \nU.S.C. § 1997, the United States filed this civil action against the Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico \nand pertinent officers, alleging violations of the constitntional and legal rights of a group of \npersons  with developmental disabilities  served  by the Commonwealth's Mental Retardation \nProgram (\"MRP\").  Near the time of the fiUng of the action, the parties entered into a remedial \nsettlement agreement, which set forth preliminary requirements for the Commonwealth to better \nmeet the needs of hundt'eds ofthen-institutionaUzed participants with developmental disabilities. \nIn subsequent years, the parties entered into  several  other agreements, including one which \nprovided for a Joint Compliance Coordinator (\"JCC\") to monitor compliance efforts, as well as an \nextensive plan to transition the participants from institutional settlngs to integrated community \nplacements.  The Court has entered each ofthese agreements as an Order ofthe Court.  \n. While  the  Commonwealth has made notable progress iti certain areas,  there  remain \npending goals to be fully achieved in certain other areas.  In light ofthis, the Court has .mandated \ncollective efforts to try to reach agreement on an action plan to discipline and structure future \nCommonwealth efforts towards  achieving compliance.  After much  collaboration,  including \ninput from the ICC, the parties have agreed upon a plan, hereinafter called the \"Compliance Action \nPlan,\" that is consistent with the parameters and framework of the existing remedial docnments \nalready agreed upon by the patties and adopted by the Court. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Existing Legal Framework on Substantive Issues \nThere. are  three  primary  substantive  Court  Orders  in·  this  case  that  define  the. \nCommonwealth's obligations to MRP P31iicipants:  the Interim Settlement Agreement (\"ISA\"), \nthe Supplemental Interim Settlement Agreement (\"SISA\"), and the Community-Based Service \nPlan (\"CBSP\").  Before this case may be closed, the Commonwealth needs to adequately comply \nI \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 2 of 18 \nwith each provision ofthese three existing Court Orders.  Set forth below is a summary outline of \nthese three primary substantive Court Orders. \n(1) The interim Settlement Agreement was adopted by the Court on May 4,1999.  In the ISA, the \nparties recognized that the rights of the participants that are part of this lawsuit \"are secured and \nprotected by the Constitution and laws ofthe United States.\"  The parties entered into the ISA \"for \nthe purpose  of avoiding protracted and adversarial litigation.\"  The ISA generally outlines \nspecific remedial measures for the institutions open at that time.  However, it also provides \nongoing obligations on the Commonwealth to meet MRP participant needs going forward.  Three \nof the most important requirements of the ISA mandate that the Commonwealth provide lv1RP \nparticipants with adequate health care, psychiatric care, and safety: \na.  With regard to health Care, the ISA requires that the Commonwealth \"ensure that [MRP \nparticipants] receive adequate preventive, chronic, routine, acute, and emergency medical \nand nursing care in accordance with generally accepted standards of care.\"  ISA § II. G; \nb.  With regard to psychiatric care, the ISA requires that the Commonwealth \"provide \nadequate and appropriate routine and emergency psychiatric and mental healt~ services in \naccordance with accepted professional standards to [MRP participants] who need such \nservices.\"  ISA § rr.F.; and \nc.  With regard to safety, the ISA requires that the Commonwealth \"ensure that [MRP \nparticipants] are provided with reasonably safe conditions and that they are free from staff \nabuse and neglect.  The Commonwealth shall prevent undue risk of harm associated with \nthe aggression or other maladaptive behaviors of other [participants].\"  ISA § II.D. \n(2) The Supplemental Interim Settlement Agreement was adopted by the Court approximately a \nyear later in 2000, and installed Dr. John J. McGee as the Court's agreed-upon monitor (called the \n\"Joint Compliance Coordinator or 'JCC''').!  The SISA also re-asserted the ongoing viability of \nthe ISA:  \"The Interim Settlement Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\"  SISA § 1. \nThe SISA recognized that \"despite defendants' efforts to achieve remediation pursuant to the terms \nof the Interim Settlement Agreement, full  compliance with its terms  in accordance with the \nprescribed time deadlines has not been achieved.\"  SISA at I. \n(3) The Community-Based Service Plan was jointly agreed upon by both parties, and then filed \nwith the COUlt by the Commonwealth in September 2001.  The Court entered the CBSP as an \nOrder of the Court in October 2001.  The CBSP is a much more extensive and detailed set of \nrequirements that requires the Commonwealth to:  (i) provide conimunity-based placement and \n___ \ttrealmen1Jllpartiojp-\"lntdu_th-<Un0st integrllteilBeJting_wheneYeLappropriate, _ancLto_llffectively __ _ \nfoster their independence and participation in the local community in a manner consistent with \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999); ~nd (ii) provide participants with adequate protections, \n1 A few months ago, the Court appointed an assistant to the JCC, who is to work exclusively under the direct \nsupervision and lnstruction ofDt'. McGee.  Order Appointing Assistant to Court Monitor, Oct. 29, 2010 (Doc. 1049). \n2 \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 3 of 18 \nservices, and supports to meet their individualized needs in the community at all times.  Among \nmany other detailed provisions, the CBSP requires the Commonwealth to: \n-ensure that each participant's individualized plan is appropriate and implemented fully to \nmeet the ongoing needs of each participant; provide the type, quantity, duration, and level \nof  support  in  the  community  for  each  participant  according  to  the  participant's \nindividualized needs, capabilities, and desires; and ensure :that each participant receives \nneeded care in the areas of health, safety, and personal and social needs as set forth in each \nparticipant's individualized plan; see, e.g., CBSP at 10-11 (the Commonwealth shall ensure \nthat \"the type, quantity, and duration of supported-living services received by the MRP \nparticipants  [is]  detennined  on  an  individualized  basis,  according  to  each  MRP \nparticipant's needs and capabilities\" as established in each participant's annual plan; the \nCommonwealth shall \"assure that each MRP participant receives support services in \naccordance to his/her needs\" pursuant to each participant's annuai plan); \n- provide  clinical  services  that  attend  to  personal  objectives  regarding  community \nintegration, mental health, behavioral considerations, physical health considerations, and \n'other individualized clinical needs; see, e.g., CBSP at 15-16 (the Commonwealth shall \n\"attend to any physical, psychological and behavioral considerations and foster the MRP \nparticipants' full community integration; the Commonwealth shall provide \"habilitation \nand  clinical  services  to  MRP  participants  in  the  least  restrictive  community-based \nsettings\";

the Commonwealth shall \"establish a quality \nassurance  component  to  ensure  that  [each  participant's  plan]  is  appropriate  and \nimplemented fully to meet the ongoing needs of each MRP participant\"); \n- provide an adequate and appropriate nun;ber of community staff, including adequate \nservice mediators, who wili ensure that the community placements are appropriate and that \nthey meet the individualized needs of each participant;

 the  Commonwealth  \"will  alTange  with  each  supp0l1ed-living-service \nprovider  to assure  available  and  appropriate  transportation  for  participation  in  the \ncommunity life\"); \n- expand  community services  and  supports  to  meet the  needs  of participants in the \ncommunity; see, e.g., CBSP at 13 (the Commonwealth \"will evaluate currently available \ncommunity resources and expand community residences, services and supports to meet the \npersonal needs ofMRP participants recommended for community ... and will establish a \nschedule to develop such settings and services\"); \n- ensure that participants are free from abuse and neglect in the community and that any \nidentified deficiencies are remedied promptly; and for all other incidents, ensure that direct \ncare and supervisory community staff follow up appropriately to protect the participants \nfrom harm, prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future, and develop  and \nimplement plans to protect participants from risk offurtber halm; see, e.g., CBSP at 9-10 \n(the Commonwealth \"will review and implement its protocol on abuse and neglect to \nensure  that  MRP  participants  al'e  free  from  abuse  and  neglect  in  their  neW \ncommunity-based treatment or placement,\" such that this  \"protocol will  ensure that \nidentified deficiencies are remedied promptly\";

the Commonwealth \"will identify potential victims of \nassault and frequent aggressors,\"  and for potential victims, the Commonwealth \"will \ndevelop and implement plans to protect them from risk offurtber harm\"); \n- provide services to enable participants to successfully and securely achieve independent \nliving  skills  such  as  feeding, mobilization, dressing, personal hygiene,  and  all  other \nself-help activities;

and \n•  provide  participants  with vocational  and joh  experiences,  such  as  supported  and \ncompetitive employment opportunities, that will encourage the development ofappropriate \nwork habits, attitudes, and· job-related motor and psychosocial skills; see, e.g., CBSP at \n15-16 (the .Commonwealth \"will provide each MRP participant appropriate habilitation \nand pre-vocational skills training and services for the development of independent living \n4 \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 5 of 18 \nand community integration\"; the Commonwealth \"will provide its MRP participants with \nbasic vocational experiences that will encourage the development of appropriate work \nhabits, attitudes and job-related motor and psychosocial skills\"; the Commonwealth will \ndevelop \"vocational alternatives for MRP participants, such as supported and competitive \nemployment opportunities\"): \na\nIn  subsequent Transition Order, while summarizing progress made in the case to date, the \nCourt reiterated the importance ofthese Orders, and directed the Commonwealth to \"fully comply \nwith  all existing Court  Orders  in this  case,\"  including the ISA, the  SISA, and the CBSP. \nTransition  Order,  Dec.  10,  2008  (Doc.  794),  at  2.  In  the  Transition  Order,  the  Court \nre-emphasized the specific thrust of the earlier Orders, and, among many requirements, stressed \nthat the Commonwealth is to: \nkeep participants safe and ensure that appropriate remedial measures are developed and \nimplemented in response to incidents and investigations;  ­\nensure that -all participants are provided with adequate and appropriate health care \nservices to meet the individualized needs of each participant; \nensure  that participants  with  a  mental  illness  receive  adequate  and  appropriate \npsychiatric services; and \nmaintain and enhance the MRP's quality assurance system to track and follow-up on \nparticipants and their ongoing needs. \nrd. at 2, 3,  The Court has reinforced all this in several subsequent Orders.  See, e.g., Order, Aug. \n17,2009 (Doc. 884), at 1 (\"The Court expects the Commonwealth to ensure the health, safety, and \nwelfare ofparticipants by complying with the Court's many orders.\"); Order, Dec. 11,2009 (Doc. \n926) (\"the court expects the Commonwealth to fulfill all of its continued obligations towards the \nparticipants, as required by the Constitution and Laws ofthe United States\"); Order, Aug. 2, 2010 \n(Doc. 1001) (\"no action will'be taken that places in jeopardy the constitutional rights ofprogram \nparticipants\"). \nB.  Current Compliance Landscape \nAs referenced above, the Commonwealth has taken a number of steps to implement the \nrequirements ofthe various COUlt Orders.  For example, it is undisputed that the Commonwealth \nhas transitioned to the community a significant number of participants in dozens of integrated \n___ ~homes. _See_Transition_Order,. Dec. 10,.2008 (Doc, '7.j)4},..at-l-(~th€-Commonwealth-has to this- - ---­\ndate opened 55 community homes and eight developmental centers\"); see also Commonwealth's \nInformative Motion Regarding the Mental Retardation Program, June 16, 2011 (Doc. 1145), at 1 \n(\"Total Number of Commlmity Homes - 53\").  Moreover, the Commonwealth has engaged a \nsignificant number of suppOil and  direct personnel to provide needed  services to  the MRP \nparticipants. \n5 \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 6 of 18 \nThere remain, however, pending goals y,t to  be fully achieved in certain other areas. \nThere are outstanding issues with regard to health care, mental health services, habilitation, and \npalticipant safety.  Moreover, not all :MRP participants who need integrated employment and/or \nvocational  opportunities currently have them.  For example, the COUlt has stressed that the \nCommonwealth is to continue \"important ongoing efforts to frud employment and/or vocational \nopportunities for qualified participants, and maintain employment and vocational opportunities for \nthose palticipants that qualify.\"  Transition Order, Dec. 10,2008 (Doc. 794), at 3.  The Court has \nrepeatedly directed the  Commonwealth to address outstanding needs in this area.  See,  e.g., \nOrder, Jan. 9, 2009 (Doc. 799), at 1; Order, Aug. 17, 2009 (Doc. 884), at 2 (\"The Court reiterates \nthe need for the .Commonwealth to  address the  outstanding vocational  needs  of dozens  of \npruticipants.\");  Court  Mins.  of Proceedings  and  Order,  Oct.  8,  2009  (Doc.  899),  at  2 \n(\"Vocational/Job area needs to be fully advised by Commonwealth.\"); Order, Dec. 11,2009 (Doc. \n926), at I; Tr. of Status Hr'g (Dec.  16, 2010), Dec. 24,2010 (Doc.  1074), at 8 (the issue of \nparticipant  employment  remarns  unresolved;  the  Commonwealth  must  implement  needed \nremedial steps - \"I've been waiting too long for this to happen, and steps have to be taken\"); and \nCourt Mins.  of Proceedings and Order, Apr. 27, 2011 (Doc.  1117), at 2 (\"The Puerto Rico \nDepartment of Health needs to maximize work by participants in the community.\"). \nC.  Maintenance of Current Efforts \nIn its  Transition  Order,  the Court stressed that the Commonwealth is  to \"ensure the \ncontinuity of the pl'Otections, supports, and services currently provided to participants,\" such that \nthey are \"not interrupted or diminished,\" and such that \"any progress and momentum toward \nmeeting participants' needs under Olmstead will not be lost.\"  Transition Order, Dec. 10, 2008 \n(Doc. 794), at 2.  In that Order, in addition to what was listed in the previous section, the Court \nspecified a number of services that the Commonwealth should continue, including: \n-Maintain the system of integrated community homes and day programs to ensure that the \nparticipants are placed and served in the most integrated setting; \n- Pay providers on time each month for legitimate invoiqes, and malntain the MRP's \nprovider payment tracking, reporting, and follow-up system; . \n- Provide participants with adequate and appropriate habilitation 'and training services in \nintegrated community settings according to the individualized needs of each participant; \n-Provide necessary habilitation, training, protections, supports, and services to participants \nat the community-based Developmental Centers; \n-Maintain service mediators for all participants; and \n-Ensure that service mediators identify unruet needs and develop, implement, and oversee \nremedial measures based on participant needs. \n6 \n\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Documen.t 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 7 of 18 \nId. at 3-4. \nThe Court has issued a series of subsequent Orders that similarly reInforce the need for the \nmaintenance and continuity ofsupports and services, especially in light ofrecent fiscal constraints. \nSee, e.g\"  Order, Aug, 17, 2009 (Doc, 884), at 2 (\"The Court urges the Commonwealth to maintain \nprogrammatic  and  leadership· continuity within the MRP  in  order to  better  ensure  needed \nprograms, services and protections to the participants\"); Mins. of Proceedings and Order, Oct. 8, \n2009  (Doc.  899), at  1 (\"There have been no budget cuts, staffing decreases, no freezing of \npositions and no fiscally negative moves.  The Commonwealth submits situation will continue. \n:MRP  Program  will  request the Health Department to  disburse' remaining moneys  for  first \nsemester.  This is essential so that services remain uninterrupted\"); Order, Feb. 25, 2010 (Doc. \n954)  (\"services  to  the Participants  of the  program  shall  remain  uninterrupted\");  Mins.  of \nProceedings and Order, Aug. 19,2010 (Doc. 1010) (\"The COUl1 reminds the Secretary [ofHealthJ \nthat, as agreed by the pal1ies, the services to the participants shall remain unintelTupted unless \notherwise ordered\"). \nIII.  COMPLIANCE ACTION PLAN \nIn order to better focus the Commonwealth's time, energy, and resources going forward, set \nforth below are specific compliance action steps that the Commonwealth must implement on or \nbefore June 3 0, 2012.  The action steps are organized into broad categories that are  entirely \nconsistent with the maudates of existing Court Orders in this case.  The categories are:  (1) \nCommunity Placement from Institutions; (2) Provider Capacity Expansion in the Community; (3) \nIntegrated Employment and Day Activities; (4) Safety and Restraint Issues; (5) Health Care and \nMental Health Care; and (6) System-Wide Reforms.  There are specific tirneframes set forth \nbelow within which the Commonwealth is to have achieved each step. \n1.  Community Placement from Institutions \nA.  On or before October 31, 2011, the C0!llmonwealth shall re-evaluate the remaining MRP \nparticipants  who  currently reside  in  the  Instituto  Psicopedagogico,  John  Christmig,  Centro \nShalom, or Modesto Gotay institutions, and then develop and implement a plan to place them into \nintegrated community residential settings in a manner consistent with Olmstead and the CBSP. \nB.  If there are obstacles, other than family member or guardian objections, to placing any \nparticular MRP participant out of any ofthe institutions in a manner consistent with Olmstead and \nthe CBSP, on or before November 15, 2011, the Commonwealth shall list the obstacles, ifany, and \nthen develop and implement the steps necessary to overcome these obstacles. \nC.  On or before January 31, 2012, the Commonwealth will set up individual.meetings with the \nMRP  participants'  family  members  or  guardians  who  are  opposed  to  placement  from  an \ninstitutional setting to discuss alternative placement within the community in a manner consistent \nwith Olmstead and the CBSP.  Specifically, in these meetings, the Commonwealth will offer an \nactual,  available community residential placement, with adequate. and appropriate protections, \n7 \n\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 8 of 18 \nsupports, and services, as an alternative to the institutional placement, in a manner consistent with \nOlmstead and the CBSP.  Whenever possible, Commonwealth official(s) will take the family \nmembers and guardians on a tour ofthe offered co=unity placement, as well as other community \nplacement sites that are already serving MRP participants successfully.  Throughout this process, \nthe  Commonwealth  shall  document  its  efforts  to  offer  and  provide  integrated  community \nresidential and other services and supports for each ofthese MRP participants.  At the end ofthis \nperiod, the Commonwealth shall inform the Court of the result of such endeavors and, for those \nfamily  members and guardians who continue to  oppose placement, the Commonwealth may \nrequest the Court to provide guidance as  to the need to  continue to  educate opposed family' \nmembers and guardians about the viability and appropriateness of community placement for the \naffected MRP particiNnts. \nD.  On or before March 1, 2012, the  Commonwealth shall develop and implement a plan to \naddress  and  give  appropriate  follow-up  with regard to  the placement needs  of other MRP \nparticipants who currently reside in mental homes, ASSMCA homes; or other settings that may not \nbe truly integrated. \nE.  Consistent  with  CBSP  requirements,  the  Commonwealth will  ensure  that  appropriate \ntransition plans are developed and implemented when an MRP participant is transfel1ed from an \ninstitution to a community setting andlof between community homes.  Once placed in community \nsettings,  this plan shall  ensure that the  MRP participants receive all  necessary protections, \nsupports, and services in accordance with the CBSP. \n2.  Provider Capacity Expansion in the Community \nOn  or before  January 31,  2012, the  Commonwealth will  develop  and  implement effective \nmeasures to expand' available residential and other provider capacity in the community such that \nthe community capacity will be sufficient to enable the Commonwealth to provide the MRP \nparticipants with adequate and appropriate protections, supports,  and services  to meet their \nindividualized needs and ensure their health, safety, and welfare.  The intent here is to reduce the \nnumber of persons residing in each community home, to increase the level of individual attention \ndevoted  to  participants  day-to-day in the  community homes,  to ·create a more peaceful and \ntherapeutic living environment in the c01l]Il1unity homes, and to improve outcomes for participants \nday-to-day.  These measures will include effective ongoing outreach. efforts to regularly increase \nthe number of high-quality prospective residential providers available and able to adequately and \nappropriately meet the needs ofMRP participants. \n3.  Integrated Employment and DavActivities \nA.  On or before November 30, 2011, the Commonwealth will te-evaluate all MRP participants \nwho have been previously identified as able to work.  This shall Include, at a minimum, each \nparticipant:  who has ever had a full-time or a part-time job in an integrated community or other \nsetting; who has already been determined as having potential for employment; who has already \nbeen detelmined as being promoted for employment;' who has ever worked in a micro-enterprise or \n8 \n\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 9 of 18 \nsimilar type ofwork arrangement based out of a diU1710; or who has ever worked in a brigade.  The \nre-evaluations shall focus on each MRP participant's work interests' and abilities.  The results of \neach re-evaluation shall be set forth in writing.  The results of each re-evaluation shall include \nconcrete action steps with timeframes so as to maximize full employment opportunities and/or \nwork-related activities in integrated community settings according to each person's individualized \nneeds.  For those MRP participants who are already working, the re-evaluations shall also include \naction steps to ensure that each MRP participant is working in an integrated community setting and \nis  not underemployed.  (Given the  current economic situation, \"work-related activities\" may \ninclude any regularly-scheduled community work that is not remunerated for a time; nonetheless, \nthe Commonwealth will continue its efforts to find paid employmeilt for participants engaged in \nnon-paid work-related activities.  \"Integrated\" in this section means in the community, outside of \nthe home and/or diumo.) \nB.  On or before January 31, 2012, the Commonwealth shall implement the actions steps in the \nwritten re-evaluations referenced above; this shall include placing MRP participants identified as \nable  to  work  and/or  underemployed  into  integrated  employment  and/or  other  appropriate \nwork-related activities in integrated community settings that meet their individualized needs. \nC.  On or before April 30, 2012, the Commonwealth will evaluate the rest ofthe MRP participants \nto  determine  whether they  can  handle and/or  benefit from  integrated  employment or other \nappropriate work-related activities.  These evaluations shall focus on each person's work interests \nand abilities.  The results of each evaluation shall be set forth in writing.  The results of each \nevaluation shall include concrete action steps with timeframes so as to, maximize full- or part-time \nemployment  opportunities  and/or  work-related  activities  in  integrated  community  settings \naccording to each person's individualized needs. \nD.  On or before May 31, 2012, the Commonwealth shall implement the actions steps in the \nwritten evaluations referenced above; this shall include placing MRP participants identified as \nable to  handle and/or benefit from  integrated employment or other appropriate work-related \nactivities into integrated employment and/or other appropriate work-related activities in integrated \ncommunity settings that meet their individualized needs. \nE.  Whenever a determination is made that an MRP participant will not benefit from or carmot \nhandle  full- and/or  part-time  integrated  employment  and/or  other  appropriate  work-related \nactivities, the Commonwealth shall develop and implement an individually tailored program, on or \nbefore May 31, 2012, to provide each MRP participant with more meaningful integrated activities \nthroughout each day.  The Commonwealth shall use the results of the aforementioned evaluations \nto guide this process.  To that end, the Commonwealth shall significantly increase individualized \n. _skillstraining.and habilitation.actirities£or each MRPparticipantday~to-day, that include real-1ife­\nvariables, in the community whenever appropriate and/or possible, with outcome measures that \nwill be meaningful to participants, with an emphasis on providing training in functional contexts. \n9 \n\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 10 of 18 \nF.  On or before May 31, 2012, the Commonwealth shall identify those MRP participants who \ntypically  remain  at  home  and  do  not  attend  services  at  a  diurno  on  a regular basis;  the \nCommonwealth  shall  then  conduct  an  individualized  assessment  to  determine  why  these \nindividuals do not participate more in integrated activities in the community or in regular diurno \nactivities.  For each MRP participant, the Commonwealth shall develop and implement a new or \nrevised individualized plan to involve these participants in community life and/or diurno activities \nto the extent they can handle it, and as is appropriate according to their individualized needs. \nG.  With regard to non-work-related activities for all MRP participants, the C.ommonwealth shall \nemphasize  participant  involvement  in  and  with  the  community  as  much  as  possible  and \nappropriate, according to each participant's individualized needs.  Such community activities may \ninclude community ad hoc volunteer activities and community business and recreational outings, \nsuch as going to grocery stores, phamiacies, restaurants, theaters, libraries, and places of religious \nexpression.  The Commonwealth shall develop and implement a plan to ensure that community \nproviders are meeting contractual and other obligations with regard to the requirements of this \nparagraph. \nH.  On or before November 30, 2011, the Commonwealth shall review its quality assurance \nmeasures and structures to ensure that areas such as staffing, transportation, and other resources \nare  adequate  to  meet  the  MRP  participants'  needs  for  employment  and  other  community \nintegration activities and opportunities. \nI.  On or before January 3, 2012, the Commonwealth shall evaluate the internal MRP structure \nand available 1vIR1' staff and other resources to determine if they are adequate and appropriate to \nprovide  the  MRP participants  with  integrated employment and other work-related  services, \nincluding habilitation activities.  This evaluation shall include the need for job coaches and job \npromoters, if any.  Ifadditional qualified staff or other resources are needed, on or before January \n31,2012, the Commonwealth will obtain them for the MRP through appointment, direct hiring, \nandlor transfer of qualified personnel within the MRP, the Commonwealth Department of Health, \nand/or any agency of the  Commonwealth.  The  Commonwealth shall  ensure that  all staff, \nespecially those from other agencies outside the MRP, are properly trained to meet participant \nneeds. \n4.  Safety and Restraint Issues \nA.  On  or before January 3,  2012,  the  Commonwealth will  conduct a safety  and welfare \nassessment  of the 1vIR1'  participants  and  their  community  residences,  and  then,  whenever \nnecessary, will develop  and implement remedial measures to  ensure participants' safety and \n_welfare ac_corJling_to_their individualized needs._TD-thisend: .. _. _____________ -­\n1.  The Commonwealth shall identify and analyze participant-to-participant interactions that \ncreate risk of harm and/or actual harm, and then develop and implement measures to address these \nrisk factors to prevent participants from harming themselves or others. \n10 \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 11 of 18 \n2.  The Commonwealth shall identify vulnerable MRP participants who are at higher risk of \nharm, and implement measures to minimize or eliminate potential risk factors. \n3.  The  Commonwealth shall  identify  aggressor  participants  and  develop  and  implement \nmeasures to minimize or eliminate potential triggers for aggression. \nB.  On  01' before January 3, 2012, the  Commonwealth will revise its Incident reporting and \ninvestigation protocols to ensure the standardized, complete, and in-depth investigation of all \nserious incidents involving MRP participants so as to improve participants' safety and welfare. \nConsistent with criteria set forth in CBSP § II.C, whenever a serious incident occurs involving an \nMRP participant, it will be reported promptly and then investigated within 45 days.  For purposes \nof this Compliance Action Plan, serious incidents include:  al.legations of abuse (e.g., physical, \n. emotional, sexual), allegations. of neglect, serious injuries, fractures, lacerations, b11Jises, risk of \nharm, aggression to staff and others, aggression to peers, self-injuries, elo'pements and attempts, \nPICA, sexually inappropriate behaviors, use of restraints (physical, mechanical, or chemical), \nsuicides or attempts, and property damage.  On or before January 3, 2012, the Commonwealth \nwill - as a result of said reporting and investigation - begin the regular practice of analyzing \npatterns and trends ofMRP participant incidents with regard to a number ofmeaningful variables, \nsuch as individual, home, site, provider, staff, shift, time of day or night, as well as any other \npertinent factors, in order to better understand the precipitating causes, if any, and how incidents \ncould be prevented in the future.  The Commonwealth shall then develop and implement remedial \nmeasures to address any individual andlor systemic issues that arise from the investigations and \n• any analysis of the incident data. \nC.  The  Cominonwealth  shall  develop  and  implement  effective  measures  to  mmnmze \nsignificantly or eliminate entirdy the use ofmechanical, physical, and chemical restraints on MRP \nparticipants.  (Restraints may be used for medical reasons, however, the Commonwealth shall \nensure that restraints labeled as \"medical\" restraints are not, in fact, used for behavioral control.) \nThe Commonwealth shall prohibit use of standing PRN or \"stat\" orders for chemical restraints. \n5.  Health Care and Mental Health Care \nA.  On or before January 3, 2012, the Commonwealth shall deVelop and implement an effective \ncommunication system andlor protocol to promptly alert all health care and other pertinent service \nand support personnel to significant changes in a participant's health status andlor mental health \nstatus. \nB.  Currently,  health care,  psycbiatric care, and other pertinent information  ahout  a\\1Y  one \n-partiCulaLpmticipanLare- scattered_and-located_.in many _differenL places._ -Certain  criticaL \ninformation is located within the participant's boine; certain critical information is located within \nthe participant's diurn02; certain critical information is contained within the notes of the service \nNursing and other health-related professionals working at each dim'uo gather health care, mental health \n\n2 \ncare, and other information about participants. \n\nII \n\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 12 of 18 \nmediators;  and  certain critical  information  is  located  within the offices  of the  participant's \ncommunity doctors.3  Given this, to better el1sure iuformed and comprehensive evaluations and \ntreatments with complete and Cl1l'rent data, the Commonwealth shall develop and implement, on or \nbefore May 31, 2012, a system to promptly gather and coordinate all ofthis information between \nand among the various sites and sources, but' especially so that it will be accessible to the MR1' \nparticipants' commUnity doctors, .including primary care physicians, psychiatrists,. and any other \nphysician  that treats  each  participant  regularly while  conducting  ongoing  assessments  and \nproviding ongoing treatments.  The Commonwealth shall continue to gather and consolidate \npertinent participant information, on a regular basis and whenever needed.  To facilitate this, on \nor before October 31, 20 11, the Commonwealth shall compile a list of all MRP participants with \nthe name, location, and contact information of their community doctors, including primary care \nphysicians, psychiatrists, and any other physician that treats each l?articipant regularly. \nC.  On or before January 3, 2012, the Commonwealth shall establish a Clillical Evaluation Unit \nwhich will serve several purposes:  it will regularly re-evaluate MRP participants; it will regularly \nreview the adequacy and appropriateness ofthe course ofhealth care and mental health care MR1' \nparticipants are receiving through their primary care community physicians; whenever necessary, \nit will promptly raise red flags and actively advocate on behalf of the MRP participants when the \nassessments, diagnoses, treatments, and/or foHow-up monitoring they are receiving through their \nprimary care community physicians do not meet the individualized needs ofthe participants andlor \ncomport with generally accepted practice; and it will serve as a mobile crisis team, providing \nprompt, flexible, mobile expert support and advice to the community homes and dlurnos in special \nsitnations, such as health care and/or mental health care emergencies, crisis interventions, and \ntransitions.  A qualified physician with adequate experience successfully treating persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities shall lead and direct the Clinical Evaluation Unit. \nD.  The  Clinical  Evaluation  .Unit's  mobile  crisis  team  shall  deliver  comprehensive, \nindividualized, and flexible treatment and supports to participants where they live and work.  The \nClinical Evaluation Unit's mobile crisis team component shall be multi:disciplinary and shall \ninclude a nurse and/or mental health clinicians.

To facilitate the effectiveness of the Clinical Evaluation Unit's advocacy efforts, on or before \nJanuary 3;2012, the Commonwealth shall develop and implement a system that will enable the \nUnit director or designee to promptly commtmicate concerns when necessary with the community \ndoctors.  The purpose of these discussions, ultimately, is to improve participants' health care and \nmental health care outcomes by clarifying with the community doctors what are the appropriate \ndiagnoses, treatments, and follow-up monitoring in individual cases such that they are based on an \nin-depth, expert,  and comprehensive assessment. \t Any subsequent discussions, if necessary, \nshould include information about any adverse health care, mental health care, or other outcomes \nfor the participant that may have occurred since the last discussion, and that may iJnpIicate the \nfuture coutse oftreatment for that participant. \nF,  On or before January 3, 2012, the Commonwealth shall develop and Implement a protocol to \naddress situations where a health care andlor mental health care provldermay have talcen action or \nfailed  to take  action that endangers the health,  safety,  andlor welfare  of any  of the MRP \nparticipants,  This shall potentially include contacting licensing agencies and/or the office of the \npatient ombudsman with regard to areas of concern. \nG.  On or before March 31, 2012, the Commonwealth shall ensure that each MRP participant's \nhealth care and mental health care plan andlor treatments are Implemented properly, day-to-day, to \nmeet  each  participant's  individualized  health  care  and  mental  health  care  needs.  The \nCommonwealth shall ensure that each MRP participant receives necessary health care and mental \nhealth care services  in a timely manner, whenever necessary, to evaltlate andlor treat each \nparticipant's health care and mental health C81'e problems.  The Commonwealth shall develop and \nimplement an expanded system to regularly monitor each MRP participant's health and mental \nhealth status and progress to prompt changes, whenever warranted, in each participant's health care \nandlor mental health care plan and/or treatments. \nH.  On or before May 31, 2012, the Commonwealth shall develop and Implement a protocol to \ngather information from various sites and sources regarding the health care and mental health care \nneeds  of the :MRP  participants  in order to  identify \"at-risk\" participants who  may require \nheightened and enhanced attention and focus.  This priority at-risk group shall consist, at least, of \nthose MRP participants who: \n- have a seizure disorder; \n\n- are non-ambulatory; \n\n-have developed or are at risk of developing a bowel impaction 01' bowel obstruction; \n\n-have developed or are at risk of developing a decubitus ulcer or skin breakdown; \n\n- are at risk of choking andlor aspirating; have dysphagia, difficulty swallowing, chewing, \n\n\"----- - or-retaiiiing~ fiJoa-or liquias; liavenad-aspirationpneu!noriiaorotlierrecurfeiiT  ---- -~ \npneumonias; cannot feed themselves; or currently use a feeding tube;  . \n\n. -use a tracheotomy tube; \n\n• have suffered significant weight losslgain that puts tllem outside their ideal body weight; \n\nor \n\n-have a mental iliness. \n\n13 \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 14 of 18 \nThe Commonwealth shall create separate lists for each at-risk condition.  Some participants may \n\nappear on one or several priority at-risk lists. \n\nI.  For these priority at-risk MRP participants, on or before May 31, 2012, the Commonwealth \nshall  work  with  the  participants'  community  doctors,  including. primary  care  community \nphysicians, psychiatrists, and auy other physician that treats the participant regularly, to help these \ncommunity doctors, whenever possible, promptly develop and implement tailored and intensive \nprotections, supports, and services, where appropriate, that meet the participants' individualized \nneeds.  The intent is that the Commonwealth will, whenever possible, prompt these community \ndoctors to develop and implement strategies to provide proactive health care and mental health \ncare such that participant seizures, bowel impactions and obstructions, aspiration and aspiration \npneumonia, decubitus ulcers and skin breakdown, and the adverse consequences of other at-risk \nconditions including mental illness will be minimized or eliminated. \nJ.  The  Commonwealth shall thereafter, on a regular basis, and from all pertinent sites and \nsources, compile incident, outcome, and intervention andlor treatment information and data for \neach priority MRP patticipant on any at-risk list referenced above.  The Commonwealth shall \nthen analyze, share with appropriate professionals/staff including the primary care and other \ncommunity physicians,  and utilize this information and data to help develop and implement \nremedies to address the individualized needs of each MRP participant. \nK.  For those priority at-risk MRP participants with a seizure disorder, on or before May 31, 2012, \nwhenever possible, the Commonwealth shall take maximum efforts'to ensure that they receive a \ncomprehensive evaluation using a detailed diagnostic work-up, by an experience4 neurologist, at \nleast annually, or more frequently as required by each participant's condition. \n1.  Such neurologist shall ensure that those participants having more than ten seizures in one year \nreceive appropriate and effective neurological interventions.  Conversely, a neurologist shall \nensure that it is still appropriate for each participant who has remained seizure-free for the past two \nyears to continue to receive anticonvulsant medication. \n2:  Such neurologist shall document the rationale and need for anticonvulsant medication in all \ncases, including whether the potential. harmful effects of the anticonvulsant medication on a \nparticipant's quality of life outweigh the potential benefits ofthe use of the medication.  The. use \nof intra-class polypharmacy shall be minimized, and whenever it is used, the neurologist shall fully \njustifY ita use in that patticipant's treatment plan. \n3.  The Commonwealth shall take proactive steps to formalize a relationship with the Epilepsy \nFoundation-oj'.}'llerto Rico-sa-as to-develop and-implement measures to-improve proactive_care for­\nparticipants with a seizure disorder. \nL.  For those priority at-risk MRP participants with aspiration and related risks, on or before May \n31; 2012, the Commonwealth shall develop and implement a system to ensure that staff do not \nengage participants in any mealtime/eating practice that poses all undue risk of harm to any \n14 \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 15 of 18 \nparticipant, including assisting a participant to eat or drink who  is  improperly positioned or \naligned, assisting a participant to  eat or drink while the participant is coughing or exhibiting \ndistress, assisting a participant to eat or drink with bites that are too large and/or faster than he or \nshe  can safely chew or swallow food  and/or liquids.  The  Commonwealth shall ensure that \nnon-ambulatory paJticipants be kept in proper alignment and not be laid flat on their backs during \nor after a meal until sufficient time has passed to allow digestion offood and/or liquids. \nM.  For those priority at-risk MRP participants with a mental illness, on or before May 31,2012, \nthe  Commonwealth  shall  develop  and  implement a  system  to  continually  ensure  that  any \npsychiatric diagnosis shall be consistent with current accepted DSM criteria, that no participant \nshall have a current mental health diagnosis that is not clinically justified in the record; and that no \nparticipant shall be prescribed psychotropic medication in the ~bsence of a clinically justifiable \ndiagnosis of mental illness.  In addition, given the high percentage of participants who currently \ntake psychotropic medication, the Clinical Evaluation Unit shall review the current medication \nregimen of each participant to  determine whether the type and -dosage  of the medication is \nappropriate and necessary, and then, if necessary, suggest any needed cbanges in the medication \nregimen.  In completing this review, the Clinical Evaluation Unit will take into account whether \nthe harmful effects of the participant's mental illness clearly outweigh the possible harmful side \neffects ofthe psychotropic medication; whether reasonable alternate treatment strategies are likely \nto  be  less  effective  or  potentially more  dangerous  than the  medication;  and  whether  the \ndecision-making process for titrating medications up or down is clearly and fully set forth in each \nparticipant's  record.  To  minimize  the  use  of  typical  or  \"fIrst  generation\"  anti-psychotic \nmedications, the Clinical Evaluation Unit shall ensure that there is full justification of their use in \nany participant's treatment plan. To minimize the use of intra-class polypharmacy, the Clinical \nEvaluation Unit shall ensure that there is full justification of its use in any participant's treatment \nplan. \nN.  On or before January 3, 2012, the Commonwealth shall create a mortality review committee, \n-comprised of well-respected health care and quality review professionals.  The purpose of the \nmortality review cominittee is to identify and promptly make recommendations with regard to any \npreventable causes of illness and/or death so that other similarly situated partiCipants will not. \nsuffer preventable illness or death. \n1. . The chahperson of the mortality review committee shall be independent and external to the \nMRP and shall not playa part in delivering health care or guiding the suggested delivery of health \ncare to any participant; this includes the community doctors, as well as personnel within the \nClinical Evaluation Unit. \n2_.  _Tp.<l lll0ltlllliYr~yiey,-committe~ s_haJLme~1JegtllarlytQ.aQQ!,ess...insliyidljaL aj1~ ~y~teI11W iSfiues __ \nrelated to each death. ­\n15 \n\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG  Document 1185-1  Filed 10/19/11  Page 16 of 18 \n3.

Background \n \nSince the inception of this case, the Court has issued a number of different orders to \nensure that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico provides effective protections, services, and \nsupports to meet the individualized needs of persons with developmental disabilities in the \nCommonwealth’s service-delivery system.  The Court has appointed a Joint Compliance \nCoordinator (“JCC”), and an assistant, to monitor the Commonwealth’s compliance with the \nterms of the various orders, to work with the parties to minimize disputes, and to keep the focus \non the Commonwealth developing and implementing measures to ensure the health, safety, and \nwelfare of persons with developmental disabilities.   \nIn recent years, in collaboration with the Court, the JCC, and the United States, the \nCommonwealth has taken steps to shift from an institutional model to a more integrated \ncommunity-based model of service-delivery.  These integration efforts are not only required by \ncertain orders in this case, they are also consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1299   Filed 11/12/12   Page 2 of 5\n2 \n \nentities, as well as the Supreme Court’s ADA decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 \n(1999), where the Court held that “[u]njustified isolation … is properly regarded as \ndiscrimination based on disability.”   \nFor a more complete summary and description of the existing legal framework in this \ncase, see the background section of the parties’ Joint Compliance Action Plan, entered as an \norder of the Court on October 19, 2011 (Docket No. 1185-1).    \nII.  Need for Transition Order Protections \nAround the time of the last gubernatorial election in 2008, the Court issued a Transition \nOrder, with specific language intended to minimize or eliminate the potential adverse impact the \ngovernment administration change could have on the ongoing and future operations of the \nCommonwealth’s Mental Retardation Program (“MRP”) and other pertinent Commonwealth \nagencies, and on the essential services provided to persons with developmental disabilities \nthrough them.  Transition Order, Dec. 10, 2008 (Docket No. 794).  Specifically, the Court’s 2008 \nTransition Order contained provisions that, among other things, prevented the automatic \ntermination of contract personnel that provided needed protections, services, and supports to \npersons with developmental disabilities.   \nThe Court remains concerned that, pursuant to local law, when there is a change in \ngubernatorial administrations, Commonwealth contracts automatically terminate at the end of the \ncalendar year before the inauguration of the newly-elected Governor.  Without a properly crafted \nTransition Order to ensure continuity, key contractors in the instant case would be terminated \nwithout sufficient, or any, consideration of the potentially dire consequences to the persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities who need the protections, services, and supports these contractors \nprovide.  Moreover, it could be weeks or months before officials in the new administration are \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1299   Filed 11/12/12   Page 3 of 5\n3 \n \nable to contract with and/or hire replacement personnel; in the interim, persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities would be vulnerable to not having their needs met and this could \nviolate existing orders in this case.  The Court notes that this is typically not a money issue – in \n2008, for example, there were sufficient budgeted funds to pay these contractors beyond the end \nof the calendar year and through the end of the fiscal year, which was six months into the \nadministration of the new Governor.    \nIII.  Supplemental Transition Order \nThe 2012 gubernatorial election results in Puerto Rico have produced a change in \nadministrations that will prompt the automatic termination of contract employees as referenced \nabove.  As in 2008, the Court has a similar interest in mitigating circumstances associated with \nthe gubernatorial election that might impede the uninterrupted delivery of needed protections, \nservices, and supports to persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s \nservice-delivery system.  Therefore, the Court is issuing today a Supplemental Transition Order, \nset forth below, to reinforce the importance of the safeguards set forth in the initial Transition \nOrder and to update certain provisions, as appropriate.   \nA.  The Court’s 2008 Transition Order (Docket No. 794) shall remain in full force and \neffect to protect persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s \nsystem from destabilizing influences that could imperil their health, safety, and \nwelfare. \n \nB.  Consistent with the 2008 Transition Order and subsequent Court orders related to \nmaintaining the MRP budget, the Commonwealth shall:  ensure the continuity and \nintegrity of the protections, services, and supports provided to persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system; ensure \nthat these protections, services, and supports are not interrupted or diminished; and \nensure that any progress and momentum toward meeting the needs of these persons \nwith developmental disabilities will not be lost.   \n \nC.  The Commonwealth presently engages a significant number of contract personnel to \nprovide needed protections, services, and supports to persons with developmental \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1299   Filed 11/12/12   Page 4 of 5\n4 \n \ndisabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system.  As in 2008, the Court \ncontinues to have a strong interest in ensuring that the continuity and integrity of \nneeded protections, services, and supports not be compromised by the automatic \ntermination of these contract personnel after the election and before the inauguration \nof a new Governor.   \n \nD.  Given the essential function of these contractors, the Court hereby orders the \nCommonwealth Department of Health to retain the services of all contract employees \nthat provide protections, services, and supports to persons with developmental \ndisabilities within the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system, until further order of \nthe Court.   \n \nE.  The Commonwealth shall ensure that there are sufficient funds to pay these \ncontractors beyond the end of the 2012 calendar year and through the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year, which ends on June 30, 2013. \n \nF.  The provisions of this order should not be interpreted as creating any vested interest \nfor the incumbents in any of the positions within the Commonwealth Department of \nHealth.  To the contrary, the Court recognizes that the incoming administration must \nbe allowed to exercise its widest discretion, so long as the incoming administration \ncomplies with existing orders of the Court to provide needed protections, services, \nand supports to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of persons with developmental \ndisabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system. \n \nG.  Upon motion by the Commonwealth, filed after the inauguration of the new Governor \non January 02, 2013, the Court will consider any request to modify, amend, or vacate \npertinent provisions, as appropriate. \n \nH.  The Commonwealth Secretary of Health is hereby ordered to deliver a copy of this \norder to the members of the transition committee for the incoming administration \nduring the Department of Health transition meetings.  \n \nPrior to the next status hearing in this case on December 5, 2012, the JCC and the parties \nshall collaborate, and then inform the Court if necessary, on the need for additional provisions to \nbetter ensure the continuity and integrity of the protections, services, and supports provided to \npersons with developmental disabilities during and after the time of transition.  \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1299   Filed 11/12/12   Page 5 of 5\n5 \n \nSo ordered. \n \nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, on this 12th day of November, 2012. \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                    s/Gustavo A.

To that end, the Commonwealth must\n12 adequately fund the operation of the MRP through the entire fiscal year. The Commonwealth has\n13 designated $40.9 million dollars as the MRP budget, which is roughly the same as the past fiscal\n14 year’s budget. However, only $22.3 million dollars of that amount has been directly designated to\n15 the MRP. The Court expects the remaining funds ($11.7 million within the Department of Health\n16 and $6.8 million within OMB) to be made readily available whenever necessary to meet the needs\n17 of participants, who shall be guaranteed their full rights under the Constitution and law of the United\n18 States.\n19 To help ensure this, the Commonwealth shall report monthly to the Court, Dr. McGee, and\n20 the United States the total amount expended by the MRP so that all parties can better monitor\n21 funding needs as certain thresholds are approached. In addition, the Commonwealth shall provide\n22 information each month to Dr. McGee that shows that community providers are being paid monthly\n23 in a timely manner.\n24\n25 As was discussed fully at the May 14, 2009 status conference, the transition order of\n26 December 10, 2008 (Docket 794) continues to be in effect such that no personnel will be fired and/or\n27 positions eliminated without Court approval. This, however, does not include terminations of\n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 884   Filed 08/17/09   Page 2 of 2\n1 Civil No. 99-1435 (GAG) 2\n2 individual employees for cause. However, if there are terminations for cause, the court expects the\n3 Commonwealth to refill the position with another employee in a timely manner.\n4 If the Commonwealth would like to re-structure the services provided to MRP participants,\n5 it shall provide such a proposal to Dr. McGee and the United States with ample notice and time to\n6 allow for their review and input.\n7 The Court reiterates the need for the Commonwealth to address the outstanding vocational\n8 needs of dozens of participants. This includes the need to hire additional Job Coaches and Job\n9 Promoters. The Court has raised this issue on numerous occasions and expects prompt actions on\n10 this matter.\n11 The Commonwealth shall make payment in full to Dr. McGee for all approved outstanding\n12 invoices by September 15, 2009. If payment is not made by this date, the Court anticipates issuing\n13 a show cause order as to why the Commonwealth has failed to comply.\n14 The Court urges the Commonwealth to maintain programmatic and leadership continuity\n15 within the MRP in order to better ensure needed programs, services, and protections to the\n16 participants.\n17 The Court anticipates monthly status hearings and visits of homes and centers.  The next one\n18 will occur on October 19, 2009.\n19 SO ORDERED.\n20 In San Juan, Puerto Rico this 17th day of August, 2009.\n21\n22\n  S/Gustavo A. Gelpí\n23 GUSTAVO A.

      "text": "U.S.  Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney General  Wuhington, D.C. 20035\nJune  11,  1997\nH ill  Illl C?.'JAlnvesti9ation\n  || |\nII  I II II I IIII 111 III II I\n1\n\" W J U H J I \"   \"\nLa Fortaleza, San Juan, PR  00901\nRe:  Center for Integral Services\nRio Piedras. Puerto Rico\nDear Governor Rossello:\nLast year, we notified you, pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997, that we were\ninitiating an investigation of conditions at the Center for\nIntegral Services (\"CIS\") in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.  From\nFebruary 26-28, 1997, we conducted an investigative tour of the\nfacility accompanied by an expert consultant in behavioral\npsychology and psychopharmacology.  During our investigation, we\ntoured the facility, interviewed Department of Health officials,\nfacility administrators and staff, spoke with residents and their\nfamily members, and reviewed pertinent documents.\nCIS is a state-operated facility serving approximately\n36 men and 17 women with varying levels of developmental\ndisabilities.  This facility is one of six state-operated\nresidential facilities serving persons with developmental\ndisabilities in Puerto Rico.  Most of the CIS clients have some\nability to walk and talk and have either mild or moderate mental\nretardation.  Most of the clients also have behavior problems,\nincluding many who are mentally ill as well as mentally retarded.\nThere are no children in the facility  (the youngest residents are\ntwenty years old), nor are there any elderly residents (the\noldest client is fifty-four years old).\nIn investigating CIS, our purpose was to evaluate whether\nresidents were being afforded their constitutional and federal\nstatutory rights.  All residents of state-operated mental\nretardation facilities have a Fourteenth Amendment due process\nright to adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care,\nreasonably safe conditions, and training.  Youngberg v. Romeo,\n457 U.S. 307  (1982).  In addition, the Commonwealth must provide\npublic services to individuals with disabilities that represent\n\n- 2 -\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. See,\ne.g., Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12132 et seq. .- 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); and Section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 ££. seq.\nand. the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.  Further, the\nCommonwealth must provide services and programs that are readily-\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. See\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150.\nConsistent with statutory requirements, we are now writing\nto inform you of the findings of our investigation of CIS.\nThroughout our visit, representatives from the facility and the\nPuerto Rico Department of Health were candid in acknowledging\nthat many service areas at CIS are inadequate and require\nremedial attention.  During our tour, we found numerous\nconditions that violate the constitutional and federal statutory\nrights of the CIS residents.  A major cause of many of these\ndeficiencies is that the Commonwealth has not devoted adequate\nresources to provide essential services and safe conditions to\nthe CIS residents.  In particular, CIS has an insufficient number\nof adequately trained staff across all disciplines, including\ndoctors, nurses, therapy and activity staff, direct care staff,\nand maintenance workers to meet the needs of residents. The\nfacts that support our findings of unlawful and unconstitutional\nconditions at CIS are set forth below along with the remedial\nactions that we believe are necessary to remedy these conditions.\nAs a preliminary matter, however, we would like to express\nour appreciation for the cooperation and courtesy shown us by\nCommonwealth officials and facility administrators and staff\nduring our investigation.  We especially appreciated the\nassistance we received from Dr. Nayda Negron, the Director of the\nMental Retardation Program in the Puerto Rico Department of\nHealth, from Ana Rivera -Maldonado, the CIS Facility Director, and\nfrom Dr. Julian Irizarry, the CIS primary care physician.  While\nwe were at the facility, Dr. Negron, Ms. Rivera, and Dr. Irizarry\nmade every effort to ensure that our team had access to whatever\ninformation we needed.  We hope to be able to continue working\nwith the Commonwealth in such a cooperative atmosphere.\nI.  CIS FAILS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE SAFETY TO RESIDENTS AND TO\nMEET THEIR BASIC CARE NEEDS\nIndividuals residing in a state-operated institution have a\nfundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to basic care\nand reasonably safe conditions of confinement.  Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  However, CIS fails to provide\nadequately for the most basic care needs of its residents and\nfails to provide reasonable resident safety, thereby violating\nthe legal rights of its residents.\n\n- 3 -\nA.  CIS Fails To Provide Reasonable Resident Safety\nThroughout our investigation, we uncovered a high level of\nincidents, injuries and dangerous situations at CIS that have\nharmed residents or placed them at great risk of harm.  Because\nof poor recordkeeping and lack of aggregate data, it was\ndifficult to determine the exact number of incidents and injuries\nthat occur at the facility on a day-to-day basis.  Nonetheless,\nit was quite clear that the incidents and injuries were\nwidespread and systemic and occurred on a daily basis.  Many of\nthese incidents, injuries and dangerous situations were\npreventable and reflect systemic deficiencies at CIS including\nlack of adequate staffing, failure to supervise residents, and\ninadequate assessment and treatment of mental illness, cognitive\nimpairments, and behavior problems.\nOn our tour of CIS, we generally found a dangerous\nenvironment for the clients.  We noticed many CIS residents with\nfresh injuries, including lacerations and bruises, as well as\nhistorical remnants of past injuries suffered at CIS, such as\ndisfiguring scars.  Many clients had suffered facial injuries or\nsevere injuries on the back of their heads with resulting deep\nscars and hair loss.\nThe Facility Director, Ana Rivera, readily acknowledged a\nproblem with ensuring client safety, including protecting\nresidents from staff abuse and resident-on-resident aggression.\nFor example, she told us that one CIS staff member had recently\nbeen convicted for sodomizing a client.  Further, in a\nFebruary 18, 1997 memorandum to Dr. Nayda Negron, Ms. Rivera\nexpressed concern that serious incidents could occur because CIS\ndoes not have the capacity to protect vulnerable residents from\nother residents who are aggressive and violent.\nAs discussed in greater detail below, many of the injuries\nthat CIS residents suffer are a result of the facility's failure\nto address the harmful behaviors they exhibit.  Other injuries\noccur due to an inadequate number of staff to supervise residents\nand protect them from harm.  The Director estimated that she does\nnot have her full complement of three staff on both units more\nthan half the time.  She acknowledged that when this occurs,\nstaff are not able to supervise residents, placing them at risk\nof harm.  In fact, at least once a month, there is only one staff\nmember working on a given unit, leaving ratios of 1:36 on the\nmen's unit or 1:17 on the women's unit, which our consultant\nagreed was insufficient to provide reasonable resident safety.\nThe Director has alerted her superiors in the Department of\nHealth about the ongoing staffing problems on a number of\n\n- 4 -\noccasions.  For example, in memoranda dated December 2 and 16,\n1996, to Dr. Negron and Auxiliary Secretary Soto, the Director\nrequested additional direct care staff to ensure the safety of\nCIS residents and to provide them with needed services.  Neither\nof these requests resulted in more staff.\nParents and family members of CIS also identified a number\nof unsafe conditions and injuries suffered by their relatives\nwhile residing at CIS.  For example, one parent of a CIS client\ntold us that his son has been subjected to physical abuse from an\nunknown source while at the institution.  He showed us recent\npictures of his son with a very swollen, bulbous, purple and\nblack eye.  The father told us that his son has suffered a host\nof other injuries at CIS including a broken nose, a severe knee\ninjury, black and blue marks on his torso, an injury over his\neyes, and various head injuries, some requiring sutures.\nAnother parent showed us photographs, taken in January of\nthis year, revealing her son with serious injuries he sustained\nwhile at CIS, including a swollen black and blue right eye, a\nbloody left eye socket, bloody swollen lips, and a face marked\nwith fresh lacerations.  The mother reported that her son has\nalso suffered a fractured arm, numerous lacerations, bites,\nbroken teeth, and black and blue marks all over his body while\nliving at CIS.  She said that because her son has been injured so\nmany times, he is now limited in the use of his hands to one\nindex finger and thumb on each hand.  She told us that before\nplacement at CIS, her son had not suffered these types of\ninjuries.\nThe facility generally fails to document and maintain proper\nrecords when incidents and injuries occur.  Moreover,\ninvestigations of injuries at the facility are also inadequate.\nThe few internal investigations of serious incidents that have\nbeen conducted were carried out by an overworked social worker at\nthe facility who is not formally trained as an investigator.\nThere are far too many \"unexplained\" injuries and incidents at\nCIS, the causes of which are never investigated or identified.\nIn addition, there appears to be a code of silence among the CIS\nstaff where the staff do not report abusive incidents.  The\nFacility Director admitted that some of the unexplained injuries\ncould be the result of staff abuse and that incident\ninvestigations are inadequate.  Similarly, family members we\ninterviewed are not satisfied with the internal investigations\nconducted at CIS and they have been frustrated at the facility's\nnon-responsiveness when injuries occur.\n\n- 5 -\nIn sum, CIS is a dangerous and unsafe environment for the\nindividuals who live there.  The Commonwealth has failed\nadequately to protect the CIS residents from harm, in violation\nof their constitutional rights.\nB.  CIS Often Fails To Provide Sufficient and Adequate\nFood. Medicine. Basic Care and Shelter To Residents\nThe Commonwealth also violates CIS residents' constitutional\nrights by failing to meet their most basic and essential needs\nfor food, medicine, shelter, clothing and basic care.\n1) Food. Medicine and Supplies\nDuring our tour, we discovered that the facility runs out of\nfood monthly and that it routinely runs out of certain critical\ndrugs.  Shortages of anti-convulsant medications are especially\nacute, compromising the health of the many residents with\nepilepsy who need such medications.  As a result, the Director\nadmitted that recently, she has been forced to buy needed drugs\nat the pharmacy with her own money.  The Director has repeatedly\nreported this dire situation to the Secretary of Health to no\navail.  For example, in a December 10, 1996 memorandum to\nDr. Negron and a December 10, 1996 memorandum to the Auxiliary\nSecretary of Health, Dr. Sylvette Soto Colon, the Director\nreported that the Center was not receiving needed food,\nmedications and cleaning products to meet the needs of the\nresidents and that she was forced to collect money from the staff\nin order to buy needed food for the clients.  She sent similar\nmemoranda expressing her difficulty in obtaining needed supplies\non November 12, 1996, October 11, 1996, and June 3, 1996.\nParents of CIS residents also advised us that they often have to\nprovide the medicines their children need because CIS does not\nprovide them.\n2) Physical Environment\nThe physical plant of CIS is in a state of disrepair.  Our\nexpert consultant concluded that it is \"grossly inadequate to\nmeet the needs of the residents.  The building and general\nphysical environment are  ... dilapidated and neglected.\"  The\npaint on the cinder block walls, doors and cement floors is\nchipped and/or peeling.  The overhead lights do not work in many\nof the bedrooms and the bathrooms.  All of the bathrooms are\nneglected, dilapidated, with peeling paint, and often dirty, with\nmoldy and mildewed tiles.  Residents have to sleep on beds with\nold, worn mattresses that are dirty and often wet.  Moreover,\nalmost all of the toilets on the men's side of the building do\nnot work, and many of the toilets on the women's side, do not\nfunction properly.  The staff told us that in order to flush the\ntoilets, maintenance workers must pour a bucket of water into\nthem.  As a result, on our tour, we found that virtually all of\n\n- 6 -\nthe toilets on the men's side had urine and/or feces in them,\nproducing a health hazard and an unpleasant,  malodorous\nenvironment.  The Commonwealth has not devoted  sufficient\nresources to keep the building and the physical plant in proper\nworking order.  Moreover, the CIS physical plant does not  conform\nwith ADA accessibility  requirements, despite the fact that  some\nresidents must use wheelchairs  for mobility.\nIn addition, offensive smells permeate the environment,\nresidents are cramped together in small spaces with nothing to\ndo, aggressive residents run throughout  the hallways,  attacking\nother clients, and the noise level  is overpowering.  Throughout\nour visit, we constantly heard residents' screams and groans of\ndiscomfort  coming from the residents' rooms and hallways.  In\nsum, the environment  is chaotic and non-therapeutic  and violates\nCIS residents' rights to adequate  shelter.\n3)  Clothing\nCIS fails to safeguard clients' personal possessions,\nparticularly  their own clothing.  It is quite common for  clients\nto be dressed  in other residents' clothes, simply because  the\nclient's own clothes could not be located.  The CIS Director and\nother staff readily admitted that clients' clothes  often\ndisappear.  The parents we interviewed concurred that the\nclients' personal effects are frequently missing.  More than one\nparent  told us that they have learned that residents'  clothing\nhas been stolen.  The parents have often witnessed their  children\nin strange clothing that does not belong to them or in the  same\nclothing for several weeks at a time.  These conditions  violate\nCIS residents' rights to be provided with adequate clothing by\nthe  Commonwealth.\n4) Basic  Care\nThe Commonwealth  is violating the clients' right to basic\ncare and services.  In addition to the issues referenced above,\nwe noticed other areas of neglect.  For example, most of the\nclients walked around the dirty cement floors in their bare feet.\nStaff do not assist clients in proper grooming and hygiene  and\nduring our tour clients' appearances were generally unkempt.  A\nparent of a CIS client reported that when she visits her son, she\noften finds him naked and drenched in his own stool and urine.\nMoreover, we noticed that the few wheelchairs  that were in use at\nthe facility were in various states of disrepair.  The arm pads\nor sling backs were ripped and torn or the footrests were\nmissing.\nThe staff also fail to respect the clients' right to privacy\nand dignity.  Staff admitted  to us that they routinely bathe  the\nmale clients by lining them up naked and hosing them down in\ngroups in one particular  shower stall outfitted with a garden\n\n- 7 -\nhose.  Typically, three clients are hosed down in the shower\nstall, three others wait naked just outside the stall, and three\nmore are lined up naked outside the bathroom waiting to get in.\nII.  CIS FAILS TO PROVIDE ITS RESIDENTS WITH ADEQUATE\nPSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SERVICES AND TRAINING PROGRAMS\nOR WITH PROPER PSYCHIATRIC CARE AND SERVICES\nA.  Psychological and Behavioral Services and Restraints\nIndividuals residing in a state-operated institution have a\nfundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to minimally\nadequate or reasonable training to ensure their safety and\nfreedom from undue restraint, prevent regression, and improve\ntheir ability to exercise their liberty interests.  Youngberg v.\nRomeo. 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  The Commonwealth is denying CIS\nresidents their right to adequate and appropriate training and\npsychological services.\nCIS does not provide residents with needed psychological\nassessments or behavior management programs.  Our expert\nconsultant concluded that \"[t]here is absolutely no semblance of\nany coordinated psychological services provided to the residents\"\nat CIS.  There is no psychologist on staff to provide\npsychological assessments and to develop behavior management\nprograms that comport with generally accepted practice.  Our\nconsultant concluded:  \"Given that a majority of the residents\nexhibit behavior problems and are typically not occupied for most\nof the day, the absence of a well-trained behavioral psychologist\nto provide the needed psychological services is a very serious\nconcern.  Indeed, not providing these services means that the\nresidents are being neglected and are not assisted to live\nindependent lives.\"  Instead of properly treating the clients'\nmaladaptive behaviors, CIS uses restraints and psychotropic\nmedication.\nThere are no appropriate behavior plans to address the\nclients' maladaptive behaviors despite the prevalence of\ndangerous behaviors at the facility.  Indeed, our consultant\nconcluded that CIS staff are not employing current methods of\nbehavioral care.  For example, in a number of client rooms, it\nwas evident that clients had kicked in wooden doors so severely\nthat there were large gaping holes in the doors.  Moreover, the\nstaff pointed out that some clients remove floor tiles and eat\nthe dried glue under the tiles.  Rather than address these\nbehaviors through appropriate interventions, CIS staff use\ninappropriate ad hoc measures.  They lock the bathroom to stop\none particular client from drinking from the toilet, rather than\ntrying to teach the client not to drink from the toilet.  More\ngenerally, they purposely keep personal belongings, top sheets,\nblankets and pillows off the beds and away from the clients\n\n- 8 -\nduring the day because they fear that the clients will use them\nto hurt themselves and other clients.  Staff told us that a\nnumber of clients have tried to commit suicide and/or suffocate\nother clients with the items.  In addition, residents' beds are\nbolted to the floor and facility staff have removed most of the\ndoors on client bedrooms to prevent clients from hurting\nthemselves or others.  Many of the bathroom sinks have been\nremoved because the clients have broken them.  These measures are\ninsufficient to protect CIS residents from harm because they do\nnot address the residents' underlying behaviors.\nCIS also does not provide residents with skills training\nprograms to prevent regression and assist residents in\nfunctioning more independently.  During our tour, we never\nobserved any of the clients engaged in meaningful activity.\nInstead, the residents are left to wander around aimlessly or to\nsit or lay in bed, idle with nothing to do.  It was quite common\nfor us to find clients sitting on the cold, bare cement floor\nrocking back and forth.  Some of them were crying.  We also\nwitnessed one client walking around naked and another taking off\nher clothes in front of others while screaming loudly.  The\nDirector acknowledged that she and her staff do not write and\nimplement proper individual habilitation plans for the clients\nand serve instead as \"custodians.\"\nAs a result of the chronic lack of appropriate psychological\nand behavioral programs and services, many clients deteriorate\nmarkedly while in the Commonwealth's care at CIS.  Several\nparents told us that their children had lost the ability to walk,\ncommunicate, and take care of themselves after they were admitted\nto CIS.  One parent told us that her son has continually\ndeteriorated since the day she brought him to the facility\napproximately ten years ago.  She said that her son used to be\nable to walk but that now he is confined to a wheelchair.\nAnother parent also told us that his son has \"deteriorated\ntremendously\" since his transfer to CIS.  Once an athletic and\nstrong man, his son lost significant functioning in his ability\nto walk and speak after he was admitted to CIS.\nIn addition, CIS frequently uses restraints as a substitute\nfor meaningful activity during the day or for appropriate\nprograms to address maladaptive behaviors.  These practices\ndepart substantially from accepted professional standards.\nBecause CIS does not properly record its restraint usage, it is\nimpossible to quantify the use of restraints.  However, the staff\nat the facility told us and showed us that to control residents\nthey routinely use mechanical restraints, such as leather cuff\nbelts  (which are tied to the heavy metal beds around the limbs of\nthe clients), restraint vests and straight jackets, and restraint\nnets .\n\n- 9 -\nThe physical environment of CIS underscores the punitive\nnature of the facility and is unduly restrictive.  Surrounding\nthe campus of the facility, there is a high chain-link fence with\nbarbed wire on top of it.  Inside the facility, separating the\nmain lobby and the two wings of the building, there are heavy\nmetal doors that are clamped down and locked to confine the\nclients to their units.  In all of the men's rooms and in many of\nthe women's rooms, there are thick prison-like iron bars grafted\non top of the windows and many of the doors, including the door\nat the main entrance to the facility.\nB.  Psychiatric Care and Services\nThe Commonwealth has failed to provide CIS residents with\nappropriate psychiatric care and services.  Most of the residents\nare put on psychotropic medication simply to control their\nbehaviors without appropriate psychiatric assessments, diagnoses,\ntreatment and monitoring.  Although many of the residents are\nboth mentally retarded and mentally ill, there is no psychiatrist\non staff at CIS and no psychiatrist currently visits the\nfacility.  The Director has written to her superiors detailing\nthe problems this causes clients with mental illness.  For\nexample, in a November 21, 1995 memo to Dr. Negron, the Director\nrequested that CIS clients be evaluated immediately by a\npsychiatrist and she requested that a psychiatrist be assigned to\nthe Center.  At the time of our tour, more than 15 months later,\nthe evaluations had still not taken place and no psychiatrist had\nbeen assigned to CIS.\nCIS's monitoring of psychotropic drug side effects\nsubstantially departs from generally accepted professional\nstandards.  In fact, there is no formal system in place at CIS to\nmonitor the effects of different classes of medication.  Instead,\nthe CIS general physician simply makes visual observation of the\nclients and/or talks to the nurses and direct care staff in\nassessing whether or not side effects are present.  Contrary to\naccepted professional standards, he utilizes no formalized rating\nscale to measure side effects, thereby placing the clients at\nundue risk of adverse side effects of psychotropic medications.\nIII. CIS FAILS TO PROVIDE ITS RESIDENTS WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE\nAll residents of state-operated institutional facilities\nhave a Fourteenth Amendment due process right to adequate health\ncare.  Youngberg v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  Nonetheless, CIS\nis failing to provide the residents with the health care and\nservices they require.  Our consultant concluded that \"the\nmedical and nursing needs of the residents are not met, and the\nstate of care that can be provided with resources currently\navailable to [CIS] is totally inadequate and fails to meet\ngenerally accepted practice.\"\n\n- 10 -\nThere have been recent, chronic shortages of medicines,\nsutures, gauze and other needed supplies at the facility.  Most\nnotably, the shortages of anti-convulsant medications have\ndirectly and adversely affected the clients with epilepsy.  CIS\nprovided us with a list of clients who had recently suffered\nseizures because the facility had run out of needed anti-\nconvulsant medications.  For example, CIS resident Marcelino D.\ndid not receive her prescribed seizure medications and had\nseizures on twenty-one separate days in 1996; Heriberto S. did\nnot receive his prescribed seizure medications and had seizures\non ten separate days in 1996; Jorge C. did not receive his\nprescribed seizure medications and had seizures on eight separate\noccasions; and Bernaldino de L. had seizures and did not receive\nhis prescribed seizure medications on six separate days.  The\nfacility also provided us with an August 5, 1996 letter from the\nconcerned mother of a CIS client who was hospitalized for\nseizures due to a lack of needed anti-convulsant medication at\nthe facility.  Moreover, although a number of CIS residents have\nepilepsy, the facility does not provide adequate access to needed\nservices by a neurologist.\nThe CIS primary care physician does not treat CIS residents'\nacute illnesses and injuries on-site.  Instead, he makes\ndiagnoses, and then sends the clients off-site for treatment at a\nlocal hospital, Centro Medico.  The nurses' role is similarly\nlimited.  Some clients have suffered injuries and have not been\ntreated in a timely fashion.  For example, Inovel 0. suffered an\ninjury to his arm, but was not taken to the medical center for\nseveral hours even though he needed immediate treatment.  Our\nexpert consultant concluded that medical services would improve\nat CIS \"if the physician is able to provide the full spectrum of\nmedical services on campus.\"\nIn addition to the severely limited nature of the general\nhealth and medical care provided to the residents, there is no\nphysical therapy, occupational therapy or other forms of therapy\nat CIS.  Dental care is also inadequate at the facility.  It was\nevident on our tour that many clients' teeth had not been cared\nfor in a prolonged period of time.  Many had begun to lose their\nteeth prematurely due to neglect and injury.\nOverall, the Commonwealth's failure to provide needed\nmedical supplies and specialized, acute, and routine health care\nservices to CIS residents deprives them of their constitutional\nright to adequate medical care.\n\n- 11 -\nIV.  THE COMMONWEALTH FAILS TO ENSURE THAT CIS RESIDENTS ARE\nBEING SERVED IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING APPROPRIATE TO\nTHEIR NEEDS\nThe Justice Department has promulgated regulations pursuant\nto the ADA that require public entities to serve individuals in\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  Although CIS has taken steps to evaluate\nsome residents to determine whether they could be served in\ncommunity settings, it has not conducted appropriate professional\nevaluations of all residents.  Moreover, a number of residents\nwho have been referred for community placement remain confined at\nCIS because of inadequate and limited resources in the community.\nOur expert consultant concluded that \"some of the residents are\nbeing neglected, and possibly harmed, as a result of their\ncontinued residence in the facility when they are ready for\ncommunity placement.\"  Removal from the adverse conditions of CIS\nwould help some clients immediately.  Finally, for residents who\nhave been transferred to the community, there is no system in\nplace to monitor the adequacy of services.  Dr. Negron\nacknowledged that community services in Puerto Rico need to be\nexpanded and monitored.\nIn each of the areas outlined in this letter, conditions at\nCIS violate the constitutional or federal statutory rights of\nresidents.  As noted earlier, many of the deficiencies result\nfrom inadequate resources.  Our expert consultant concluded:\n\"Although the Director  ... and her staff are valiantly trying to\nprovide the best services they can, they simply do not have the\nresources to do what is necessary to fully meet the residents'\nneeds.\"  For years, Dr. Negron  (a former clinical services\ncoordinator at CIS), Ms. Rivera, and the CIS Directors who\npreceded Ms. Rivera, have written a series of letters and\nmemoranda to the Department of Health expressing concern about\nthe negative impact on the care and services provided to CIS\nresidents caused by inadequate funding.  Despite this knowledge,\nthe Commonwealth has failed to give CIS sufficient funds to\nprovide essential items and services to its residents.  Although\nfederal funding is available through the Medicaid system to help\nprovide adequate services at CIS and in the community, the\nCommonwealth does not receive this funding.  In order to address\nthe serious deficiencies outlined in this letter, we are willing\nto explore ways that we can assist the Commonwealth in obtaining\nthis funding.  Due to the nature of the deficiencies and their\nlong-standing duration, we believe that it is necessary to enter\ninto a judicially enforceable agreement to memorialize any\nagreement we may subsequently reach.\n\n- 12 -\nV.  MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES\nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and to protect the\nrights of the CIS residents, the Commonwealth should implement\npromptly, at a minimum, the following measures:\n1.  Safety and Basic Care\nThe Commonwealth must provide reasonable safety to all CIS\nresidents.  The Commonwealth should implement enhanced\ninvestigation procedures to ensure that all incidents are\nproperly recorded and reviewed and that all injuries are fully\ninvestigated and underlying causes are identified and remedied.\nThe Commonwealth must ensure that CIS residents are provided with\nsufficient supplies of food, medicine, equipment and staff, and\nthat the residents receive adequate and appropriate basic care.\nMoreover, the Commonwealth should ensure that the CIS physical\nbuilding is properly maintained in good working order, including\nbut not limited to the timely repair of toilets and other\nplumbing, showers and shower stalls, light fixtures, windows,\ndoors, walls, beds and any other furniture.  Finally, the\nCommonwealth should safeguard all clients' personal possessions,\nespecially their clothing, from loss and/or theft.\n2.  Psychological Services. Training Programs, and Restraints\nThe Commonwealth must provide adequate training programs and\nneeded psychological services.  In addition, the Commonwealth\nshould provide an adequate array of comprehensive individualized\ntraining programs for CIS residents developed by qualified\nprofessionals consistent with accepted professional standards to\nreduce or eliminate risks to personal safety, unreasonable use of\nbodily restraints, prevent regression, and teach residents basic\nself-care skills.  To this end, the Commonwealth should conduct a\ncomprehensive interdisciplinary evaluation of each CIS resident\nto determine the individual's need for training and psychological\nservices; develop and implement a professionally based,\nindividually appropriate data collection system to measure\nrelevant information about maladaptive behaviors; have a\nqualified professional develop and implement and monitor a\nprofessionally based, individualized training program for each\nresident; and provide each individual with an adequate number of\nhours of training.\nIn addition, the Commonwealth must ensure that CIS residents\nare not subjected to undue restraint.  The Commonwealth should\nensure that bodily restraints are used only pursuant to accepted\nprofessional standards, and that they are never used as\npunishment, in lieu of training programs, or for the convenience\nof staff.  The Commonwealth should implement a protocol that has\n\n- 13 -\nas its goal the elimination of routine use of physical or\nmechanical restraints.\n3 .  Psychiatric Care\nThe Commonwealth must provide adequate and appropriate\nroutine and emergency psychiatric and mental health services in\naccordance with accepted professional standards to residents who\nneed such services.  The Commonwealth should procure adequate\npsychiatric consult hours to meet the needs of the residents.\nPsychotropic medication should only be used in accordance with\naccepted professional standards and only where a psychiatric or\nneuropsychiatric diagnosis supports the need for such medication.\nPsychotropic medication should not be used as punishment, in lieu\nof a training program, for behavior control, or for the\nconvenience of staff.  The Commonwealth should conduct a\ncomprehensive assessment of each CIS resident with mental\nillness, develop an appropriate diagnosis and an overall mental\nhealth treatment plan for these residents, and provide on-going\nmonitoring of the treatment, including implementing an adequate\nsystem for detecting, reporting, and responding to any drug-\ninduced side effects of psychotropic medication.  The\nCommonwealth should document that, prior to using psychotropic\nmedication for behavior modification, other, less restrictive\ntechniques have been systematically tried as part of a training\nprogram and have been demonstrated to be ineffective.\n4.  Medical Care\nThe Commonwealth must ensure that its residents receive\nadequate preventive, chronic, routine, acute, and emergency\nmedical care in accordance with generally accepted standards of\ncare.  To this end, the CIS primary care physician should conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations of all residents, identify any needed\nmedical services, and ensure that such services are timely\nobtained whenever necessary to evaluate or treat the individual's\nmedical problems.  In concert with the steps above, the\nCommonwealth should provide adequate and appropriate routine,\nchronic, and emergency seizure management to all individuals with\nepilepsy at CIS in accordance with accepted professional\nstandards of care.  Specifically, the Commonwealth should procure\na sufficient number of neurology consult hours to meet the needs\nof the residents.\n5.  Nursing Care\nThe Commonwealth must ensure that its residents receive\nadequate nursing care.  To this end, the Commonwealth should\nensure that nurses perform their responsibilities in keeping with\naccepted professional standards of care by adequately identifying\nhealth care problems, notifying physicians of health care\n\n- 14 -\nproblems, monitoring and intervening to ameliorate such problems,\nand keeping appropriate records of residents' health care status.\n6.  Most Integrated Setting\nAppropriate professionals should evaluate each CIS resident\nto determine whether the resident is being served in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the resident's needs.  Where\nprofessionals determine that a resident should be served in a\nmore integrated setting, the Commonwealth should identify\nappropriate services and take reasonable steps to reallocate\nresources to meet the resident's needs.  The Commonwealth should\ndevelop appropriate time lines for placing these residents in the\ncommunity and develop and implement an adequate system to monitor\nthe adequacy of community placements.\n7.  Recordkeeping and Staffing\nThe Commonwealth should establish and maintain adequate\nclient records to ensure adequate and appropriate care, services\nand quality assurance for each resident at the facility.  The\nCommonwealth should ensure that a sufficient number of\nprofessional and non-professional staff, including outside\nconsultants, are employed to meet the needs of CIS residents.\nThe Commonwealth should ensure that the staff is adequately\ntrained to perform its duties.\nWe hope to be able to resolve this matter amicably and\ncooperatively.  Nonetheless, the Attorney General may initiate a\nlawsuit pursuant to CRIPA to correct deficiencies at an\ninstitution or otherwise to protect the rights of its residents\n49 days after receipt of this letter.  42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1).\nTherefore, we will contact you soon to discuss any actions you\nmay have taken or intend to take to address the deficiencies we\nhave identified herein and to implement the remedies described\nabove.\nFinally, during the course of our investigation of CIS, we\nlearned that similar conditions may exist at the five other\nmental retardation facilities operated by the Commonwealth:\nCentro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes in Aguadilla, Hogar de\nGrupo Las Mesas in Mayaguez, Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio in\nCayey, Centro de Reeducacion para Adultos in Bayamon, and Centro\nde Servicios Multiples Rosario Bellber in Aibonito.  Pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(2), we are therefore notifying you that we\nare expanding our CRIPA investigation to include these\nfacilities.  We hope to conclude this investigation on an\nexpedited basis and in the same cooperative spirit as our\ninvestigation of CIS.\n\n- 15 -\nWe look forward to working with you to resolve these matters\nin a reasonable and practical manner.  If you or your staff has\nany questions, please contact Richard Farano at 202-307-3116.\nSincerely,\nIsabelle Katz^Pinzler\nActing Assistant Attorney General\nCivil Rights Division\ncc:  The Honorable Pedro Pierluisi\nSecretary\nPuerto Rico Department of Justice\nThe Honorable Carmen Feliciano\nSecretary\nPuerto Rico Health Department\nMs. Mercedes Perez Rivera\nDirector, Centro de Reeducacion para Adultos\nMs. Ivette Fernandez\nDirector, Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio\nMr. Francisco Espada\nDirector, Centro de Servicios Multiples Rosario Bellber\nMs. Nilsa Curet\nDirector, Centro de Servicios Multiples de Camaseyes\nDirector, Hogar de Grupo Las Mesas\nGuillermo Gil, Esquire\nUnited States Attorney\nDistrict of Puerto Rico\nMs. Ana I.

Defendants did \nnot submit a proposed Order with their motion, therefore, to assist the Court, the United States \nalso submits a proposed Order along with this memorandum. \n1.  BACKGROUND \nA.  On April 29, :i999, this Court approved theISA, which had been submitted to the \nCourt by the parties as a corisent decree on April 21, 1999. \nB.  In paragraph K of the ISA,the Defendants agreed to develop a corrununity-based \nservice system plan and to create a community-based service system for individuals with \n.,' \n\ndevelopmental disabilities living in the Commonwealth's institutions.  The ISA specified that the \nUnited States would provid~ cOIIl]Ilents with regard to the Defendants' draft plans. \nC.  Since the filing of the ISA, the parties and the Joint Compliance Coordinator, John \nJ. McGee, Ph.D., have been 'involved in extensive ongoing discussions and negotiations with \n\" \nregard to the language of seyeral draft cormnunity plans.  The parties have kept the Court \n,  ' \ninformed of their progress in reaching agreement on a community plan in the many status \nconferences held before the Court this year. \nD,  On August 14, 2001, the Court ordered the Defendants to file their revised \ncommunity plan on or befor6 September 5, 2001. \nE.  On September 6, 2001, the Defendants submitted to the Court their [mal \nCommunity-Based Service p,lan.  The Defendants also submitted a motion requesting. that the \nCOUli accept and adopt the:S=BSP pursuant to Defendants' obligations under the ISA. \n.' \nF.'  At the status;conference with the parties on September 6, 2001, the Court directed \nthe United States to file its s;omments with regard to the Corrrrnonwealth's CBSP by \nSeptember 24, 2001.  The United States hereby submits its corrrrnents with regard to the CBSP. \nII,  DISCUSSION \n.... \nWe urge the Court to approve and adopt the CBSP submitted on September 6, 2001, as \nan Order of the COUli.  Implementation of this CBSP will bett,er enable Defendants to fulfill their \nobligations pursuant to the t$A, and will help ensure that institutionalized individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities in)uerto Rico are placed in the most integrated setting appropriate to \ntheir individualized needs cOnsistent with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), \n42 U.S.c. §§ 12132 et §§..9.;28 C.F.R. §3S.130(d). \n- 2 ­\n\n,-----­\n~---~--\nA.  The Nev,' Freedom Initiative ~nd Executive Order \nIn February of this year, w}th the New Freedom Initiative, President Bush announced that ­\nit was a high priority for the Administration to tear down barri'ers to equ3Jity and to expand \nopportunities available to ArTIericans living with disabilities.  As one step in implementing the New \nFreedom Initiative, on June 18, 2001, the President signed Executive Order No. 13217, entitled \n\"Community-Based Alternatives for Individuals with Disabilities.\" \nSpecifically, the PresIdent emphasized that unjustified isolation or segregation of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities in institutions is a form of prohibited discrimination, that the United \nStates is committed to community-based alternatives for individuals with disabilities, and that the \n.  .~ \nUnited States seeks to ensur~ that America's community-based programs effectively foster \nindependence ~d participat~Dn in the community for Americans with disabilities.  Exec. Order \n-No. 13217, Sec. l(a)-(c), 6~: Fed. Reg. 33155 (June 21,2001).  In the Executive Order, the \nPresident also ordered the Department of Justice to provide technical guidance and to work \n.~  . \ncooperatively with jurisdictions to help them assess their compliance \\vith the ADA in providmg \nservices in appropriate community-based settings.  Id. at Sec. 2(a). \nThe collaborative approach u1)dertaken in this case and the resulting consensus document \nfulfill the President's Executlve Order and represent a positive first step in vindicating the legal \nrights of the affected person~ with developmental disabilities in Puerto Rico. \nAs this Court is aw~e, for months now, we have been working closely and collaboratively \nwith the Commonwealth in prompting Puerto Rico to develop a community plan and to. establish \na community-based service system in order to place, where appropriate, institutionalized persons \nwith developmental disabilities into most integrated settings in the community.  Moreover, in all \n- 3 ­\n\nof our interactions with the Commonwealth, we have made it a priority to provide Puerto Rico \nwith technical guidance when nee~ed.  For example, with each draft submitted, the United States \nhas provided extensive and detailed technical guidance and input with regard to what should and \nshould not be included in an appropriate community plan. \nB.  Substance oBhe Community Plan \nSpecifically, the Unit.ed States supports the CBSP given that it incorporates many critical \nelements, such as providmg: \nindividualized, interdisciplinary assessments and individualized transition plans for each \nparticipant using person-centered planning principles; \na quality assurance system with enough trained community service mediators to provide at \nleast a 1: 24 ratio; \n. \n. \nsufficient monitoring and follow-up to ensure the ongoing and full implementation of the \nindividualized plans to assure that all participants receive all o'fthe protections, services, \nand supports they require; \nongoing staff training; \na\nmeasures to ensure  safe envirotime~t in the community settings through incident \nreporting and full investigations of serious incidents; and \na broad range ofintegrated community homes, including independent supported living and \nsupported homes, as well as day programming and training in integrated community \ncenters.  ,; \nThe United States also supports the inclusion in the CBSP of a family support program \nthrough which the Commonwealth commits to provide respite care and other support services for \nfamilies of persons with developmental disabilities, thus making it easier for the persons to be \nreunited with their loved ones in the family home. \n-4 ­\n\nThe development of community placement policies and procedures is to begin immediately \nupon the Court's approval ofthe ~BSP with completion of the policies and procedures to occur. \naccording to appropriate timeframes.  Training ofstaff is to occur within one month after the \ncompletion of each policy and procedure.  The individualized assessments are to be provided for \neach institutionalized resident within eight months of the training of the staff.  For those identified \nas appropriate for community placement, the Commonwealth has also agreed toa schedule of \nplacements that is to be implemented diligently and with a reasonable pace. \nC. \t New Community Home \nAs we discussed durIng the last status conference, on September 5,2001, the \nCo~onwealthcreated its first community home for several men with developmental disabilities \nwho had lived at institutions in Bayamon, PR.  We are encouraged that the Commonwealth has \nbeen able to effectuate this placement in spite of numerous obstacles.  As we reported to the \nCourt, our prelimillary review of this home was very positive .. \nWe hope tl).e Commonwealth will continue in its efforts to build promptly its community \ncapacity so as to be able to serve persons with developmental disabilities who are ill need ofsuch \nplacements ill the most integrated settillg. \nIII. \t CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and consistent with the Defendants' motion of September 6,\n.  . \n2001, we request that the Court sign the attached proposed Order, and approve and adopt the \nDefendants' CBSP. \n- 5 ­\n\nRespectfully submitted, \nRALPH F.

The h1RP will implement this \nCBSP in a manner consistent wIth the United States Supreme Court opinion in Olmstead v. L.e, 527 \nu. \nS. 581  (1999). Where cOrnrTIlmity placement andtreatment is appropriate in the least restrictive \nsetting and the:1v1RP participant. desires such placement and treatment, the Commonwealth ofP  uerto \nfuco will reasonably accorrunodate the iV!RP participant in the community taking into account. the \nresources available to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the needs of other individuals \\vith \ndevelopmental disabilities that t:he Commonwealth ofPu.erto fuco serves. \nFor purposes of this CBSP, \"Iv1RP participants\" are those individuals who at the time ofthe filing of \nUnited States of America v. The Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico, et aI. USDC-PR Civil Case No. 99­\n1435  resided in or thereafter admitted, that will be admitted or were transferredfrom any of the \nfollo\\ving six (6) iv1RP facilities to another facility or community setting and for whom this CBSP has \nbeen developed: Centro de Servicios Integrales Para Adultos con Retardaci6n iv1ental \"CSIARtvr' in \nMepsi Medical Center in Bayam6n, PR (\"iv1EpSI\" or \"BAYAl\\.-rON I\"); Centro Reeducaci6n Adultos \nMinusvalidos in Bayarn6n, PR ('.'RAM\" or \"BA YAMOl\" II\"); Facilidad de Cuidado Intermedio in Cayey, \nPR (\"CA'fEy\"); Centro Rosario Bellber in Aibonito, PR (\"ArnOl'<1TO\"); Mayaguez Regional Hospital \nHealth Care Center in Mayaguez, PR (\"lvL~YAGUEZ\"); and Centro de Serviciqs Multiples Carnayeses, \nAguadilla,  PR (\"AGUADILLA\").  In addition, the  CBSP incorporates by reference the  Complaint, \nInterim  Settlement Agreement and  the Supplemental Settlement Agreement  in United States of \n/\\merica '/. The Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico, et al USDC-PR Civil Case No. 99-1435 as it applies \n\nto the definition of.NIRP participants. \nConsonant with the mission of the CBSP and consistent with the Olmstead decision, the.MRF will: \nDevelop the NffiP's capacity to place qualified j\\1RP participants in community settings, rather \ne \t\nthan  in  institutions,  whenever treatment  professionals  determine  based  on  their reasonable \nassessments. that such placements are appropriate,  the affected persons  do not oppose such \nplacements, and the Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico can reasonably accommodate the placements, \ntaking into account the resources available to the Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico and the needs of \nother individuals with developmental disabilities served by the Commonwealth. To procure this, \nthe MRP will take a number, of steps including: \n• \t Coordinate inter-agency efforts with public and private sectors of the community to procure \nthe implementation of this community service system for the l'vfRP participants. \n• \t Initiate legislative projects that promote the development of a fanUly support program, in \norder to foster :each l'vfRP participant's integration with his/her family and strengthen the \nfamily's capability to ass0me a supportive role with the lvlRP participant. \n• \t Promote public policy in fayor of the rights of IvIRP participants in the Commomvealth of \nPuerto Rico. \n• \t Ensure that i\\fRP participants live, work and interact in a safe environment, which fosters human \ndevelopment and protects the rights and dignity ofthe IvrRP participants. To accomplish this, the \n:tvfRP will take a number of ~teps including: \n• \t Incorporate person-centered principles into all MRP assessment and planning procedures, as a \n\\ovay to foster the Iv1RP participant's self-determination, independence and, where possible, \nactive family participation. \n• \t Create and maintain serv:ices, which support and  protect i\\lr:R.P participants' civtl rights in \nmatters of health, educati'on, self-determination, productivity, family life, social inclusion, and \nquality of life. \n• \t Establish professionally appropriate practices to ensure the consistency and the quality' ofall \nservices and supports pr~vided by the :tvIRP to its l'vIRP participants. \nEnsure that all MRP participants receive adequate habilitation services that foster their fullest \ndevelopment,  independent  living,  adaptive  skills,  and  community integration,  attend  to  any \nphysical psychological and behavioral considerations.  To procure this,  the l'vIRP will take a \nnumber of steps including: \n• \t Promote interagency efforts  to  implement this  CBSP  with  re,gards to  the  availability of \n\nvocational and job opportunities for the rYIRP participar:'.s. \n•  Ensure that ?vIRP participants are provided with habilitative services and supports aimed to \nfoster the :rv1R.P participants' social skills, independence and social participation. \n•  Ensure that 1'vIRP participants who have been transitioned to community-based homes have a \nreliable means of transportation within the community. \nSECTION II:  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CO~lIVIUNITY \n,PLACE~IENT ASSESS~IENT, TRANSITION \nAND:ONGOING QUALITY ASSURL\\NCE \nA.  GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR ALL COIVEVIUNITY-BASED SERVJCES \nThe IVIRP will adopt professionally accepted practices that promote consistency and the quality of \nservices and  supports for the TvlRP  partici pants.  The following  practices wiI1  be  adopted  in the \nimplementation of the CB SP: \n1.  ·PERSON-CENTERED PLANNING PRINCIPLES \ns\nTo foster the:tvIRP participant\"  self-determination, independence and, where possible, active family \nparticipation, the i\\1R.P will incorporate person-centered planning principles (\"PCPP\") into all of its \nassessments, planning and service delivery procedures. \nAmong' other principles and methodologies that the NIRP will  adopt in its  CBSP, the NIRP will \nembrace the following principles from the person-centered planning philosophy: (a) focus on the ivIRP \nparticipants' needs, capabilities, interests, resources and his/her quality oflife as the basis for service \ndelivery; (b) strive for collaboration and shared responsibilities, where appropriate, between the ~vIRP \nparticipant, rus/her family or legal guardian and the professionals involved, in all areas ofservices and \n~upports, especially in care giving, development and implementation of action plans, and  quality \nassurance; and (c) maintain an effective and continuous exchange ofinformation, at all times, with the \nrvIRP participants, their families and support systems in all supportive matters. \n.  . \nThe rvIRP's Interdisciplinary Teaml, will work together with the rv1RP participant, hislher family or \nlegal guardian and social support system to assess, plan and work on personal-growth and c6inrnunity \nintegration goals for each MRP. participant. \nSee detailed description Lll Section II A .:I of LIDs CBSP \n.-\n, \n\n2.  INTERDISCIPL.INARY TEAM \nThe l\\iR.P Interdisciplinary Teams (\"IDT') ·will conduct an individualized interdisciplinary assessment \nfor each l'vIRP participant to determine his/her needs, preferences, capabilities, interests and resources, \nprior  to  establishing  the  Individualized  Actiori  Plan,  discussed  below.  This  interdisciplinary \nassessment and planning procedure will include the full participation of the fvIRP participant and the \nmembers of his/her support system, and will follow pepp. \nThe members of the IDT will be comprised of the following according to the needs of the lv.IRP \nparticipant: appropriate professionals, the lV:lR.P participant, his/her family and/or legal guardian, the \nService Iviediators,  I\\1RP  appropriate personnel and  other persons identified  as pertinent to the \ndecision-making process of each :NfRP participant.  Members of the MRP participant's IDT may \ninclude any  of the  f9llowing  professionals:  service  mediators,  psychologists,  social  workers, \nrecreational specialists, health professionals, therapists, as well as other direct service prov'iders. \n3.  INDIVIDUALIZED ACTION PLAN \nthe \n. For' each lvIRP  participant,  l\\1RP  will  establish  an  O'v'erall  holistic  action plan,  namely the \nIndividualized Action Plan ClAP\").  The lAP will  be  comprised  of various  integrated planning \nprocedures, including at a minimum: (a) the Individualized Transition Plan:! that \"vill be established for \neach rvIRP  participant who is in the process of transition from his/her residential setting; (b) the \nIndividualized SerVice Plan3 established for Iv:lR.P participants \\vho have completed the transitional \nperiod; and (c)the Individualized Habilitation Plan4 which identifies the indi·vidualized services and \nsupports the lVlRP participant needs in order to develop functional daily living and social skills ... \nThe lAP will also incorporate any service and support plans developed through interagency efforts, to \nmeet the individualized needs of a parti cular lvlRP participant. The lAP will result from joint efforts of \nthe iVffiP  participant,  his/her family,  the .support system and  the  ivlRP's interdisciplinary team, \nfollowing PCPP. \n•  INDIVIDUALIZED HA.. BILITATION PLAN \nThe Individualized Habilitation Plan (\"ll-:IP\") is a written individualized plan, stating yearly' \nhabilitation goals and objectives for each ivIRP  participant in areas  such as:  self-care and \npersonal  hygiene,  horrie  living  skills,  interpersonal  relationships  and  commurUcation, \ncommunity integration, social behavioral skills, recreation skills and use of free time. \nThe  lliP will  be  written for  each  tvIRP  participant foIlm.ving  person-centered  planning \nprinciples.

The IHP will be revised once a year or more frequently if needed on  a \ncase-by-case basis.  . \n•  INDIVlDUALIZED SERVlCE PLAN \nThe Individualized Se·rvice Plan (\"ISP\") is a written individualized service plan for tvlR.P \nparticipants, stating yearly service and support needs, goals and means by which to address \nsuch needs,  in areas including:  home arrangements, supported living services, vocational \nandlor  habilitation  placements,  health  and  clinical  services,  transportation  services, \nrecreational activities and social and community participation.  This plan is intended as the \nalternative work-plan for  those lYIRP  participants who  do  not  require an  Individualized \nTransition  Plan  and  for  those 1v1RP  participants who  have  successfully  completed the \ncommunity-placement Jransition periods.  ­\nThe ISP will be writteri following pepp by the Iv'fRP interdisciplinary team together with the \nMRP \nparticipant and h:1s/her family or legal guardian. The ISFwill be revised once a year, or \nmore frequently ifneede4, on a case-by-case basis. \n4,  SERVICE MEDL.c\\TORS \nIn the past, the MRP had case managers as members of its \"vork team. Under the CBSP, the case \na\nmanager will qe rename as \"S:ervice Mediator\" (\"Si\\f').  The SM is ·an important component to the \nMRP's quality assurance system. Once the IDT determines that an i\\1RP panicipant is appropriate for \ncommunity placement, the SM:will inform the lYfRP participant, his/her'farnily or legal guardian ofthe \nchoices and possibilities available for community placement. The SM will ensure that the placements \nare appropriate and that they.;meet the individualized plans established for the IVIRP participants. \nConsequently, the :M.RP will assign anSlvl to every NIRP participant in a ratio that will not exceed \n1:24 to encourage frequent individual contact. The SM will be appropriately trained and supervised. \nThe SM will be a liaison between the rvIRP participant and his/her family or legal guardian, thdvlRP \nand all  service and  supports providers.  In the case of private providers, the SM will not be an \nemployee of the private provider he/she reviews. \nAs  a member of the IDT, the SM shall o\\:ersee, assist and follow-up in the coordination of the \nongoing implementation of all.services and supports established in the iv1RP participant's lAP. The \nSM will participate in the identification of community placement settings and day programs and in the \nfollow  up  of the Individualized Transition Plan from  a residential facility  to  a community-home \nplacement.  For further description ofthe individualized transition planning, see Section II. B. ofth.is \nCBSP. \nThe Siv·r shall provide periodicfollow-up to iv'IRP participants and their families as part ofthe Family \nSupport Service described later in this CBSP. \n5. See Section II B of this (ESP. \n\n5. \t QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM \nThe 1--1RP wilI develop and est.ablish a quality assurance system consistent with the mission of this \nCBSP in order to ensure that appropriate protections, serVices and supports are provided to Iv1RP \nparticipants at all times. \n6. \t STAFF TRAINING PROGRA.M \nThe N1RP wilI establish a year-~ound training program including competency-based training, for all of \nits personnel.  The program will establish a curriculum and a set number of training hours required \nannually for all staff members. The functions and responsibilities of all the ~iIRP employees, as stated \nin their job descriptions, will be revised according to the new roles under the CBSP. \nB. \t TR;\\NSITION PLAN..:FROM MRP FACILITIES TO COMrVIUNITY \nPLA CEMENT  '\"' \nTo  ensure  an  appropriate  transltlOn  process  for  IYfRP  participants from  residential  facilities to \ncommunity placements, the procedures set forth below, at a minimum, will be follo\\ved: \n1. \t PROVIDE L'\\j'TERnISCIPLINARY TEAM ASSESSMENTS TO DETERl\\-IINI THE LEAST \nRETRlCTIVE SEJTmGApPROPRLATE FOR EACH MRP PARTICIPANT \n\",! \nIn order to deter~ine which is·.the least restrictive setting for each :tv1RP participant, the IDT \\vil1 \nassess and evaluate each rvrRP participant to determine the most appropriate community placement \nsetting  to 'meet  each  participant's  residential,  health  care,  and  training  needs.  The  IDT's \ndeterminations will be docume,,nted in writing.  These evaluations \"viII be based on individualized \nneeds. \nAJI IYIRP participants will be evaluated for community placement regardless oftheir degree ofmental \nretardation and disability. In each case where the IDT determines that community placement is not \nappropriate for an lvfRP participant, the IYIRPv,;iIl specify in writing the particular reasons for that \ndetermination.  . \n2. \t DEVELOP AND  lMPLElYIEi\"Il' l\"IDIVIDUALlZED  TRANSITIONAL  PLANS  FOR  MRP \nPARTICIPA.i'ns EOR \\VHOM COlVIMlJNITY PLACEIVIEl'fT IS APPROPRIATE \nFor each M::R..P participant for V?hom the IDT determines that community placement is appropriate, \nthe IYIRP will develop and implement a written Individualized Transition Plan (\"ITP\"). TheITP will \nensure safe transition to the community and that l'v:lRP participants are placed in community settings \nthat meet his/her needs as determined by the ITP. \nThe ITP willbe a document that specifies the services and supports needed by the t-..1RP participant \nwho  will  be  moved  from  a re'sidential  facility  into  a corrimunityplacement  in  order to  ensure \nsuccessful community integration. \n\nThe TvIRP  will  develop the ITP  at  the time that is  determined that community placement or an \nalternative setting is appropriate for. an lvIf{.F participant.  While NffiP participants remain in the \nfacilities prior to community placement, they will be provided with appropriate community-based \ntraining opportunities to better enable them to transition to the community. \nThe  lIP will  be  developed  and  implemented  through  person-centered  planning  principles,  as \ndescribed in a previous section-of this CBSP. \nThe  completed ITP will  be  valid  for one (1) year or until the IDT concludes that  a successful \ntransition has taken place. The rTP will be updated, as needed, prior to placement. \n3. . \t ESTABLISH A WAITING LIST PROCEDURE \nThe iVoo will gradually build i~s capacity to place IvIRP participants in community settings, taking \ninto account the resources available to the Commomvealth of Puerto Rico and the needs of other \nindividuals with developmental disabilities and in accordance to the phases set forth in Table 2 of this \nCBSP.  Once assessed  for  transition and to  ensure  equal opportunity for placement to all  :rv-IRP \nparticipants,  as  capacity  is  being  built,  each  MRP  participant will  be  placed on  a waiting list, \naccording to the IDT' s placement recommendations. The waiting list standards will be included in the \nlIP's Policies and Procedures.;'  . \n4. \t J)EVELOP AI'tl) LY.i:PLEMEi'tT A QUALITY ASSTjRANCE SYSTEM FOR ALL COiVI::\\'I1Jl'HTY \nPLACEMENTS  TO  ENSURE  THAT  EACH  PLACEM:El'ITl\\IEETS  THE  MRP' \nP ARTICrP Ai\"IT' SL'IDNIDUALlZED NEEDS \nThe 1vlRP shall establish a quaiity assurance component to ensure that the ITP is appropriate and \nimplemented fully to meet the ongoing needs ofeach I'v1R.P participant.  Upon community placement \nof the IvIRP participant, the Si'vI. assigned to the case will look civer the :rvlRP participant at his/her \ncommunity-based setting and day program and will assess whether that placement conditions, services \nand supports meet the lYfRP participant's needs. The !vIRP will ensure that conditions and practices at \nthe community-based settings are appropriate to meet the needs of each :rvrRP participant. \nInitially, these assessment visits :will occur at least weekly or more frequently, if deemed necessary. \nOnce  the  transition  has  been  determined  to  be  appropriate,  the  SM will  continue to  perform \nevaluations and assessments within a reasonable period of time to be determined based on the needs \nof each iVIRP participant. \nThe ~JR'p will develop and implement an internal reporting system to evaluate the progress irfthe ITP \nimplementation and the community placement of those N1RP participants who have been moved from \na residential facility into the community. \nThis internal reporting system wi.ll include, at a minimum, the following quality assurance procedures: \n•  The contract \\vith the provider \\vill designate at each community placement 'a person \n-\n; \n\nwho will be responsible to complete daily written reports on the NIRP participant's \n~daptation process, during the first 90 days, and thereafter, file daily progress notes \nand  provide tf:!e  SM with  a weekly  report  on each NIRP  participant's progress, \nincluding problems, if any. \n• \t Regarding  community  placements,  for  each  IvIRP  partIcIpant,  the  SM  will  be \nresponsible for reporting to the l\\I1RP Director any problems that may affect the \"tv.!RP \nparticipant's adjustment to the new setting and any problems related to the provider \nregarding the contracted services. The SM will submit to the Director of the :MRP a \nmonthly report regarding any IvlRP participant with adjustment problems until hislher \ntransition process has been successfully accomplished, or as frequent as necessal)' \nwhen facing decision-making situations. The i'V1R..P Director will take prompt action to \naddress  the identified  problems in  order to  ensure that  each rvIRP  participant's \nindividualized  needs  are  met  pursuant  to  his/her  ITP.  The  IDT  will  conduct\" \nassessments to determine successful completion of the transition period and process. \n,5. \t PROVIDE ONGOING COlVL\"~Try SERVICES TO El'\\SURE SUCCESSF1.JL TRA.!\"l\"SITIO:\"1 \nPROCESS \nThe IvIRP will provide ongoing support and habilitation services to all IvlJ.ZP  participants placed in \ncommunity-based settings. To this end, the l\\I1RP will procure needed services and supports, including \ncommunity-based educational, habilitative and/or vocational alternatives that meet individualized \nneeds and interests of each MRP participant. \nThe iVfRP will provide prompt ,and effective crisis intervention or other needed respite services to \n[vIRP participants who present adjustment problems related to the\" transition process. In cases where \nthe i\\'IRP participant is readmitted to a more restrictive setting, the MRP will conduct an assessment \nto identify factors related. to the progress or adjusting problems of each rv.IR.P  participant in his/her \nprocess of adapting  to  community placement.  The l\\tIRP  will  deal  with the situation by either \naddressing any deficiencies related to the services and supports provided in the current community \nplacement  or  by  providing  an  appropriate  alternative  community  placement  that  meets  the \nparticipant's individualized needs. In addressing such situations, if needed, the rvffiP will provide \ntechnical assistance and/or training to community providers and/or their staff.  .  . \nC. \t QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM: SAFE ENVIRONl\\IENT, INCIDENT \nREPORTL\",{G AND INVESTIGATIONS \nTo ensure a safe environment at  all  community placements,  and  to provide  appropriate'incident \nreporting and investigation, the l\\I1RP will: \n1. \t PROVIDE A SAFE ENV1RONME;'.'T IN THE COM.,'ylliNITY SYSTEM \nTrus CBSP has been developed to ensure a safe and humane environment for all ?vIRP participants \n\\.vho have been placed in the community pur~uant to the goals and guidelines of this CBSP. \ns \n\n\nAs a measure of quality assurance, {he [yfRP will review and implement its protoco: \\)n abuse and \nneglect to ensure that Iv1RP participants are free from  abuse and neglect in their new community­\nbased treatment or placement. The protocol will  ensure that identified deficiencies are remedied \npromptly. The .l\\IIR.P's protocol on this issue will provide guidelines for the following: \n- Any staff member ,,\\rho has knowledge of or is a witness to abuse, neglect or that an 11RP \nparticipant is  at  risk  of harm by staff will  immediately take appropriate measures to \nprotect the safety and well-being ofthe rvrRP participant(s) involved, including procuring \nany necessary basic care or health care treatment. Failure to act as .such will result in \ncorrective personnel action. \n• \t Any  staff member· who  has  knowledge  of possible abuse,  neglector that an  MRP \nparticipant is at risk ofharm shall immediately report the situation to the tvlRP Director or \ndesignee.. Failure to act as such will result in corrective personnel action. \n- Evidence of possible abuse, neglect or risk of harm situation, if any, mustbe immediately \nreported by community staff to the ?v1RP Director or designee. Failure to act as such will \nresult in corrective 'personnel action.  . \n2.  CONDUCT ADEQUATE L\"NESTlGATIONS \nThe rvlRP will establish an investigation protocol system geared to assess and evaluate all reported \nincidents of abuse, neglect, serious injury and risk of harm situations, and any deaths that implica·te \nsystemic quality assurance concerns.  To accomplish this, the Iv1RP will take a number of steps \nincluding: \n.  . \n• \t Assign a trained investigator who v,'ill report to the MR.P Director.  This investigator will \nconduct a complete, objective and expedited investigation of each reported instance of \nalleged abuse, neglect and risk of harm,ifany. The l'vIRP will take the necessary steps so \nthat the IvIRP participant is free from further potential abuse, neglect and risk of harm \nwhile the investigation is in progress. \n- . Every investigation will be documented in a written fact finding report submitted directly \nto the :tv1RP Director within forty-five (45) days of the incident.  The rvIRP will' adopt \nprotocols with regard to the prompt implementation and follow up of corrective actions \nwhere necessary \n-rn cases where the investigator concludes that a member of the community staff has \nengaged in abusive  and  negligent behavior towards an :MRP  participant,  disciplinary \nmeasures will be taken diligently, including the removal ofthe staffmember(s) involved. \n• \t Upon notice of possible abuse, neglect and risk of harm conduct, the staff member will be \nprohibited  from  having  direct  contact with  ivIRP  participants,  in  accordance  to the \nCommonwealth's Labor Laws. \n\nThe rv.JRP will establish a system to report, review anc.l  evaluate all incidents of alleged abuse and \nneglect as well as significant injuries and incidents in order to help prevent recurrence ofthe incidents. \nTo accomplish this, the MRP will take a number of steps including: \n• \t Establish an incident management committee, which will: (a) conduct ongoing and follow­\nup  reviews  of all  incidents  reported and  (b)  take appropriate  steps to  address their \nprevention in the future.  . \n• \t Establish a system to collect and analyze incident data in order to identify any trends or \npatterns of incidents. When trends are identified, the MRP will  take prompt steps to \neliminate or mitigate the risk factors that caused the previous incidents. \nFor other incidents that do  not involve suspected staff abuse or neglect of rvrRP participants by \ncommunity. staff, the Iv1RP will ensure that: (a) community staff accurately and timely record all \nincidents and  provide complete explanations for incidents that result in injuries; (b) supervisory \ncommunity staff iTI\"ve~tigates fully all significant injuries and incidents arid reviews all incidents; and \n(c) the !\\\"1RP will identify potential victims of assault and frequent aggressors. For those pOtential \nvictims, the l'vfRP vvill develop and implement plans to protect them from risk of further harm. \nFor all incidents, the MR.P will ensure that direct care community staff and supervisory community' \n. staff follow-~p appropriately  to  protect  the l\\{RP  participants  from  harm  and  to  prevent the \noccurrence of similar incidents in the future. \n3.  PRoVTDE ADEQUATE AND ApPROPRIAT.E STAFFL\"iC Al'i\"D STAFF TRATh'ING \nThe lvIRP will ensure that thefe is adequate and appropriately trained staff  provide a safe, secure \nto \nand habilitative community placement and day programming environment to NffiP participants. The \ntraining  curriculum  will  include  competency-based  goals.  The  \"NIRP  'will  ensure  that  staff is \nappropriately supervised at all times. \nD. \t DEVELOPMENT OF SUPPORTED LIVW\"G SERVICES AT COM1YIUNITY- \nBASED HOIYIES  \nThe following set of quality standards constitute the minimum service requirements to be established \nin the contract between the selected provider and the IvrRP. \nThe type, quantity, and duration of the supported-living services received by the 1Y1RP participants \nwill  be  determined  on  an  individualized  basis,  according  to  each l'v1RP  participant's needs and \ncapabilities as established in his/her LAP. The IDT will assess each rvIRP participant at least yearly and \nany plan modifications will be'included in the yearly contract between the Providers and the l'v1RP. \nThe contracts with the Providers \\.vill include provisions consistent with this CBSP. \nProviders of supported-living services at community-based placements for NIRJl panicipants will \n\nassure that each lvIRP participant receives support services in accordance to his/her needs and lAP .. \n. The provider will hi fe, train and supBrvise appropriate supported-living staff (\" SLS';) to attend to the \nneeds of each :rvrRP participant,. \nAt a minimum, each TvIRP participant will receive from the provider: \nI. \t SLS THAT PROVIDES PERSONAL ASSISTANCE \n.  .: \t . .

The SLS will provide company, support, security and care for the :MR.P \nparticipant at home. \n2. \t SLS THATPROYIDESASSISTAl'l'CE IN COlVrPLETlON OF ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVlNG, \nWHEN NECESSARY \nThe SLS \";\"ill provide company and assistance to the l'v1RP participant in attending to the follmving \nactivities of daily living, when':'necessary, in his/her lAP, such as: food  shopping and preparation, \nindoor and exterior cleaning and maintenance of the community placement,  and the green areas \naround the property, transportation -driver, vehicle and needed support, teaching basic independent \nliving skills to the IvIRP participants and companionship. \n3. \t SLS THAT FOLLOW PCPP . \nThe provider will ensure that the SLS hired are trained onPCPP, including: (a) that they are hired to \nwork for the rvIRP participants at their community placements, (b) that the level of support provided \nwill vary from one participant to the next, according to the fv'JRP participant's needs and desires, and \n(c) that thel'vlRP participant's needs, desires, and opinions, \\vill be solicited and valued when making \ndecisions.  . \nThe JvIRP participant has a right to actively participate in decision-making, regarding any matter that \naffects his/her life. In its policies and procedures, the IYfRP will set the guidelines to be followed for \nsurrogate decision-making in cases' where the fvlRP participant cannot make his/her-own decisions. \nThe provider will guarantee the· right to privacy, safety, and dignity of each participant. \n. At  a \tminimum,  the provider  rpustguarantee that  every NIRP  participant  receives  a private  or \nsemiprivate bedroom and a private and safe space for his/her belongings, with access at the discretion \nof the Iv1RP participant. \nAt  a minimum,  the  provider  must  guarantee that every 1\\.00 participant is:  (a)  allowed ample \nopportunities to bathe at least once a day, with warm running water, and clean clothing available after \nhe/she bathes; (b) provide a change of clothes immediately after incidents such as: a bovvel or bladder \na\naccident or  food spill or whenever necessary or desired; (c) entitled to receive support from SLS in \nmaintaining his/her hygiene and good appearance, as frequently as needed, and to ensure that the \n1 1 \n\n\nfYfRP participant is properly dressed at all times;  (d) provided appropriate nutrition, exercise, medical \nmonitoring, appropriate medications when needed, and personal support and care; ane (c) provided \ndirect care staff services if the JvIRP participant cannot provide his/her own self-care. \nThe provider will ensure implementation of appropriate medical or psychiatric emergency procedures. \nThese procedures will be set forth in the contractual agreements. \n4.  QUALIFIED SLS . \nThe  provider must  provide adequate and  appropriate number of staff,  with adequate academic \nbackground, experience, and training to ensure that the i'v1RP participant receives the needed care in \nthe  areas of health,  safety,  and  personal and social  needs as  set  forth  in the lAP of each IvIRP \nparticipant. Provider staff must present annually, at a minimum, the following required documents: \ndrug tests and a Certification oEGood Behavior provided by the Department ofPolice ofPuerto Rico. \nThe provider will assure that iis direct support service personnel has, prior to the start ofwork with \nIvIRP participants, a minimum of 3 0 hours of competency-based pre-service training in supported \nliving services related issues, ~pdated Red Cross approved first aid training, updated CPR training, \nand any other necessary training to meet individualized needs for support services. Upon notification, \nthe provider staff will participate in specific trainings offered by the 1'v{RP.  The provider v\\'ill also \nensure that staff receives training pursuant to protocols and curricula to be developed by the IvlRP. \n5.  ApPROPRl.\\TE\"l.JfVING CONDITIONS \nThe provider will ensure that the community placement conditions meet appropriate standards of \nliving,  such  as  meeting  cOITo/lunity-building' codes  for  fire-safety  security,  running  water and \nelectricity.  The provider is responsible for the maintenance of the physical structure of the community \nplacement. The provider \"viII e,nsure that exteriors and interiors are maintained in a safe, clean and \n. attractive fashion.  The provider must have a cleaning service/system that ensures cleanliness and \norganization of all  living spaces, at all times, including floors,  walls,  ceilings, windows, kitchen, \nbathrooms (toilet, sink, bathtubs or showers), furniture, tabies and counter tops, bedrooms (beds, \ndrawers, closets), as well as the outdoor spaces (roofs, balcony, terrace, patio, sidewalks and other \nareas around the house). \nThe provider will establish and implement security measures, will provide each community setting \nwith appropriate means of com,munication (including visits and telephone calls) to foster the IYfRP. \n.  . \nparticipant's corrununication v,;ith people in his/her support system, and will have available a reliable \nand safe means oftransportation at all times with an authorized driver available at all times. \n6.

These  personnel will  ensure full \nI  communication and collaboration between the provider and the Iv1RP if} developing and implementing\nJ \n\nivIRP \nhabilitation and social integration goals for each  participant. \nIlVIPLElVIENTATJON OF \nSECTIONS IT A, B, C, AND D: POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR· \nCOMlVIUNITY PLACEMENT ASSESSMENT, TRANSITION AND \nONGOING QUALITY ASSURANCE \nAppendix A -Tables 1 and 2 present the time-frame that the TvlRP  will  follow to  develop and \nimplement the policies and protedures described in Sections II A, B, C and D of this CBSP. \nSECTION III:·  COlVliVlUNITY LIVING PROGRAlVI \nA.  COMMUNITY-BASED HOIHES \n1.  BUILDING COlVIMUNITY CAPACITY \n.. \t . \nUnder  this  CBSP,  the  IvIRP:: will  gradually  build  its  capacity  to  provide  community  living \narrangements, ·services  and  suppmts,  to  meet  the  needs  of those  ivIR.P  participants who are \nappropriate for  community placement.  The TvIRP  will  evaluate  currently  available  community \nresources and expand communlty residences, services and supports to meet the personal needs of \n:rvIRP participants recommende~ for community placement or alternative settings and services, and \nwill establish a schedule to dev~lop such settings and services. \n2.  SI.!'PPORTED LIV,ING SERV1CES \nThe lV1RP will select among the following community placement alternatives to promote appropriate \nrvrn..P \ncommunity settings for the  participantS. Although this list is not exhaustive, the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico reserves the right to  continuously evaluate these options and/or \nalternatives: \n• \t L'ffiEPEj\\iDENT HOMES;. ,This living arrangement in the community refers to a house that is \nowned or rented by one (1) or more ivIRP participants or by a family member or the legal \nrvIRP \nguardian.  Under this  arrangement,  the  participant will  live  on his/her own,  with \nintermittent support services from the tvIRP, as needed to successfully Jive in the community. \n• \t SL'PPORTED  HOLYITS  - :This  living  arrangement  refers  to  a house  in  a community  that \naccommodates a group  of:tv1RP  participants who  need  a low  but  continuous degree of \nsupport or assistance from the N1RP  in order to successfully live in  the community.  The \nsupported homes will ha:~/e the following programmatic characteristics:  (a) the house may be \na private or a public property; (b) the IV1RP will determine the quantity and type ofsupported­\n., , \n! ..: \n\nliving services according to the needs of the j'voo participants in each home;  (c) the tvIRP \nreserves the right t() select the supported-living service from private or public providers or \nother entities or agencies ofthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or may assign its personnel \nto provide the support services at the homes, or may select the service in any manner it finds \nreasonable and that meet the individualized needs of the l'vfR.P participants. \n• \t SlJBSTITIJTE H 01V1ES  - Substitute homes refer to arrangements established with families in the \ncommunity who agree to receive and care for an l'v1RP participant in their home. The Jv1RP \nparticipant will share the space and the family life with these people.  The substitute homes \nwill have the following programmatic characteristics: (a) the Department ofHealth through \ninter~agency efforts with the Department ofthe Family, will.establish this living alternative for' \nMRP participants, and  (b) these families  will  receive a monthly stipend, according to the \nestablished. Corrunonwealth' s rules and regulations that govern these procedures. \n• \t GROUP HOMES - This: living arrangement in the community refers to a home for a group of \nlVIRP participants who require a significant amount of supported services and direct care, \ntwenty-four (24) hour~ a day/seven (7) days a week. This is a residential alternative for wIRP \nparticipants who cannot be cared for in their O\\vn homes. \nThe criteria used to determine the number ofivIRP participants that \\vill reside in one group home  111 \n'1...\ninclude:  (a) that iYlRP participants have appropriate space and facilities to guarantee comfort, (b) the \nneeds  and  interests of the l\\IIR.P  participants that will  reside  therein,  and  (c) any  other  criter,ia \nregarding special conditions or situations of those ~ participants living in that group home. \nB.'  RESIDENTL>\\L FACILITIES \nConsistent w'ith the Olmstead decision, supra, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico foresees that it is \npossible that there may be cases in which the IDT recommends that community placement is not \nappropriate for certain:MRP participants. The Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico further foresees that it \nis possible that the IDT recommends community placement as appropriate, but the l'v1RP participant \nprefers residential facility to community placement. Therefore, given this, the iYfRP anticipates the \nneed of maintaining residential placement available. \nC.  COMlVIUNITY TR~NSPORTATION SERVICE \nThe rvIRP will diligently coordinate transportation services so that alll\\1RP participants, who have \nbeen transitioned to community settings, have a reliable means of transportation. To this end, the \nJvfRP will arrange with each supported-living-service provider to assure available and appropriate \ntransportation for participation in the community life.  Activities of community participation could \ninclude, but not be limited to:  shopping, recreation, medical and other professional appointments, \n. family and friend visitation, and others. \nWhere appropriate, relatives an9 other members of the ivlRP participant's personal support system \nwill be encouraged to share responsibility in transporting IvIRP participants to community activities \n\nsuch as medical appointments, recreational activities, and others. \nD.  COMMUNITY\" RECREATION PROGRAM \nThe Iv1R.P will diligently coordinate so that MRP participants are provided with an ongoing scheduled \ncommunity-based  recreational  program  to  foster  their  social  skills,  independence  and  social \nparticipation. To this end, the Iv1R.P will arrange with each provider to assure that the supported living \nservices include, at a minimum:  (a) an established schedule offrequent cultural and athletic activities \nin the community, planned throughout the year, and (b) arange ofopportunities for lv1RP participants \nto maintain interperso~al relati~nships with other members of the community. \nIMPLElVIENTATION OF \n\nSECTION Ill: COMMUNITY LIVING PROGRAlVI \n\nThe Iv1RP has prepared a 6-year projection towards building its capacity to provide community living \narrangements for the r-,,1RP participants affected by United States of America v.  Commonwealth of \nPuerto Rico, et al, USDC-PR Civil NO.99-1435.  Nothing in the CESP precludes the Commonwealth \nof Puerto Rico from implemenling its CBSP prior to the deadlines set forth in the CBSP. \nAppendix A - Tables 1 and 2 present the time-frame that the fv'lR.P will follow to develop and \nimplement Section III of this CBSP. In addition, Table 2 presents the  number of:MRP participants \nwho will be  transitioned yearly to the community and who \\-vill be receiving the services described in \nSection IV of this CSBP.  . \nSECTION IV:. COIVIIVIUNITY-BASED DEVELOPlVIENTAL \nCENTERS \nThe :rv1RP  will provide each NfRP  participant,  appropriate habilitation and  pre-vocational skills \ntraining and services for the development ofindependent living and community integration. The?vIRP \nwill provide these services and training through its existing Community-Based Developmental Centers \n(\"CBDC\") andlor through other alternatives that the Tv1RP considers appropriate and that will meet \nthe rv'IRP participants' needs. The MRP will also attend to any physical, psychological and behavioral \nconsiderations and foster the.Ivffi..P participants' full community integration. All services and supports \nwill be provided consistent with Jv1RP quality assurance and PCPP policies and procedures established \nin this CBSP.PersonrteI at the CBDC will provide supportive services consistent with this CBSP to \nbe adopted in l'vIRP ptotocoIs.· \n15  \n\nA.  HAB~ITATION AND CLINICAL SERV1CES \nThe.MRP will provide habilitation and clinical services to l'vIRP participants in the least restrictive \ncommunity-based settings.  As· described previously in this CBSP, all f\\1R.P participants will undergo \nan interdisciplinary assessment, following PCPP, to establish each participant's IHP. The 1HP will be \nestablished prior to providing any habilitation services and will be revised annually qr more frequently \nif needed. \nHabilitation services that foster independent living and social participation will be provided to the \nIv1RP participants, in accordance with his/her lliP.  The program will focus on the development of \nadaptive skills in the areas of:  communication, self-care and personal hygiene, home living skills, \ncommunity use and functional academics, self-direction, sociallbehavioral skills, recreation skills and \nuse of free time. \nThe rvIRP will also provide lVlRP participants with those clinical services recommended in his/her \ninterdisciplinary assessment and set forth in the IA.P. Treatment plans and goals will be stated in the \n1VIRP participant's TI-rP.  Clinical services will attend to personal objectives regarding: family and \ncommunity integration, mental health, behavioral considerations, physical health considerations, and \nother individualized clinical needs. \nB.  VOCATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAM \nThe NfRP's Vocational Service Program  eVSp\") \"vil! provide its ?vIRP participants with bas-ic \n.vocational experiences that will encourage the development of appropriate work habits, attitudes a..\"1d \njob-related motor and psychosocial skills. \nThe i'v'lRP  will promote the availability of vocational alternatives for :fvfRP  partiCIpants,  such as \nsupported and competitive employment opportunities.  To this end, the i\\iIRP will pro\\,.-ide leadership \nin interagency efforts to obtain vocational rehabilitation opportunities for IY'1RP participants through \nthe Department ofLabor and the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration of the Commonwealth of \nPuerto Rico, the private busine,ss sector, and through other available programs or sources. \nIn order to facilitate such interagency action, the i\\:fRP will procure updated vocational assessments \nfor MRP participants by trained and certified professionals in the field.  For this purpose, the lVIRP \nwill acquire a rehabilitation counselor who will form part of the MRP administrative team. \nLlVIPLEMENTATION OF \nSECTJON IV: COl\\lMUNITY-BASED DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS .. \nUpon the Court's approval of this CBSP, the MRP will assess the quality ofthe services provided at \nthe existing CEDC and will take the necessary steps to improve such services in order to meet the \nMRP participants' individualized habilitation and community integration ne~ds. \n\nThe  MRP's  action  plan  to  iri,1prove  its  eXlstmg  CBDC  will  address  the  following  issues:  (a) \nimplementation of all policies md pr~cedures that will be developed in accordance with the guidelines \nset forth in this CBSP; (b) appropriate staff training; (c) acquisition of equipment and material; (d) \nimprovements to physical facilities;  (e) hiring of identified personnel; (£)  quality of services and \nsupports; and (g) IvIRP participants' satisfaction with services and supports. \nAppendix A -Table 3 presents .the time-frame that the l\\Iffi.P will follow to develop and implement \nSection IV of this CBSP.  Services described in Section IV will be available for :MRP participants \nupon the commencement of their transition to the community and will continue thereafter on an \nongoing basis.  . \n\\ \nFigure A depicts a conceptual framework ofthe multidimensional services and supports provided to \nIvIRP participants within the scope of this CBSP.  . \n.~; \n:j'  . \n,,~. \n\nFi C >l RE /~ \n\nr\nCo~tuaLFra~N'omfor tht: MuLtidiVUl~Lo...aL service.s \n\na\"\"c(SL(PPOrts \"PYDvLded to MRP \"pamc.t-pa~s wtthi\"\"  \n\nSECTION V:  FAI\\-IILY SUPPORT PROGRAIVI  \nThe NIRP will promote the development of a Family Support Program (\"FSP\") to: (a) address the \nneeds  of the institutionalized NIRP participants who return home with their natural or substitute \nI \nfamily, and  (b) strengthen those familiesin their role as support system to the.MRP participant \\vith \nspecial needs in achieving a more integrated family life. \n.The FSP has the following objectives: \n, \n• \t Help institutionalized MRP participants to return home with their families in the community. \n• \t Support  families  that' bring  institutionalized  ~v1RP participants  back  home  and  into the \ncommunity. \n• \t Promote a safe and nurturing family environment for institutionalized NIRP participants who \nreturn home. \n• \t Teach  the  family  or legal guardian to  become effective  advocates  for the  rights  of the \ninstitutionalized ?vfRP participants who return home.  . \n• \t Strengthen  the  fa miV: or  legal  guardian's  role  as  primary  support  provider  for  the \ninstitutionalized NIRP participants who return home. \n• \t Provide guidance to the families who take care of?vlR.P participants at home in resolvi!1g \nfinancial, social, and emotional issues regarding such care-taking role. \nThe Commonwealth of Puerto 'Rico will pursue the development of the following support service \n, . \t\nalternatives for those families Viho receive institutionalized ivlR.P participants back home: \nA. \t SERVICE MEDLt.\\.TORS \nService Mediators or \"SM', described in Section II A oftbis CBSP, are specialized lvfRP personnel, \nassigned to each family that has.received their institutionalized.MRP participant back home, serving \n. as support and service facilitators for those families. \nB. \t SUBSIDY PROGRt.\\M \nSubsidy  refers  to  the  provision  of financial  aid  to families  who  receive institutionalized  N.lR.P \nparticipants back home.  The Department of Health will  seek funds from the private sector, the \nCommonwealth ofPu~rto Rico ,and federal sources in order to promote subsidy benefits to .support \nfamilies. The United States, as plaintiffin United States of America v: The Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico, et al. USDC-PR Civil No. 99-1435, will assist the Commonwealth ofPuerto fuca in identifying \npossible  sources of federal  funding  available to assist the  Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico  in its \nimplementation of this  CBSP ..  Once funding  becomes available through these or\" other means, \nsubsidies will be provided through vouchers, to be used for the purchase of respite care services orto \nmeet other special expenses incurred as a consequence of the TvIR.P participant's special needs. \n\nDuring the course of the implementation of this CBSP, the rvlRP foresees that other family support \nprograms may be identified and if appropriate, such programs will be adopted from  time to time and \nimplemented in accordance to the needs of the i\\IRP at the time. \nC.  RESPITE CARE SERVICES \nAs a long term goal, the rvlRP is committed to coordinate the provision of respite care temporary care \nservices, in which appropriately trained and duly certified providers take care ofMRP participants so \nthat the other members of the family or legal guardian may perform activities ofpersonal interest. As \na short-term alternative, the Iv1RP will attend to respite care services needs on a case-by-case basis. \nRespite  care service providers  could  be selected  among various possible candidates: non-profit \norganizations, religious groups;· organizations under contract with the l\\1RP;  or any trustworthy \nperson outside the family.  Members ofthe extended family, such as an aunt or uncle, could also serve \nas respite care service providers for a family. \nThe ivlRP will promote community involvement in providing respite care services.  The jvIRP will \nactively seek individual community candidates to become respite care providers for families ofrv.fRP \nparticipants who have retl,lrned home. To become respite careproviders, individuals will be trained \nand certified as qualified service providers. A list of resources could then be prepared and distributed \nto the families.  The jv[Rp will procure the availability of any of the following respite care services: \n• \t RESPITE CARE SERV1CES AT A SUBSTITlJTE HO~'I:E - refers to a home with foster parents \nwho  will  take  care  or' ivrRP  participants  during  a short  or  extended  period  of time. \nArrangements will be established between the respite care provider and the legal guardian \nand/or  the  foster  parents  of the :MRP  participants.  This  home  will  be licensed  by  the \nCommonwealth ofPuerto Rico's appropriate agency; personriei must be trained in the care of \nrv1RP participants with different levels of mental retardation. \n• \t RESPITE C.:\\R.E SERV1CES AT HOi\\fE - refers to a direct care provider, trained to work with \npersons with special needs, who goes to the family's house to provide the services. \n• \t RESPITE CARE SERV1CES PROVIDED By A FRIEi'iD/PROVIDER - refers to a respite care \nprovider who has been c~osen by the family or legal guardian, and has been trained by the \nfviRP. \n• \t RESPITE CENTER - The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will promote the private s~ctor to \nestablish respite care centers that will provide services twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) \ndays a '\\.veek. \nThe lvlRP will implement Section V. A. within four (4) months ofthe Court's approval ofthe CBSP. \n.  . \n\nSECTION VI: ADJ\\tlINISTRATIVE REORGANIZATION \nOF THE CENTRAL OFFICE OF THE IVIENTAL \nRETARDATION PROGRAlVI \nIn this section the NfRP sets forth the innovative administrative model it pursues to implement in lieu \nof the quality assurance it is set to achieve.  The Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico reserves its right to \nestablish and implement other administrative methods and managerial models as it deems necessary to \nimplement this CBSP and in accordance to the laws and public policies of the Commonwealth of \nPuerto Rico. \nGiven the aforementioned, the lYIRP expects to reorganize its central office administrative structure \nunder principles and  processes of total  quality control (\"TQC').  Through a 'TQC managerial \nframework, the central office of the rviRP wiII become normative in its role to implement the CBSP \nfor  IvrRP  participants.  Under this  administrative vision,  both,  theprogranunatic .and  the fiscal \nelements of the rvlRP management will become normative in nature. \nThe executive level of the MRP central management will be organized into three main elements: the \nnormative programmatic elem~nt, the normative fiscal element artd the normative quality element. \nThe normative fiscal office 'l-viliTespond to all acquisition and accounting processes, data c~llectiQn, \nfunds,  payments, and other fiscal matters.  The normative programmatic office will  look after all \nservices and supports provided to the rvIRP participant and his family, by public or private providers, \nwith regards to residential, habilitation, health services, vocational, clinical treatment, recreational \nexperiences and other such services that allow further community integration ofthe MRP participant. \nBoth elements ofthis managerial organization will offer technical assistance to service providers in \nissues regarding services and supports for each IvIRP participant.  Both offices will procure quality \ncontrol ofservices and wil! follow-through the implementation of the CBSP for all i\\1RP participants. \nThe third element of this managerial model is the normative quality element. The first two elements, \nnormative programmatic  and  normative fiscal  will join,  in  the  administration's effort to  assure \nproductivity, competency, quality improvement and standardization of processes in order to obtain an \nongoing and continuous improvement ofrvIRP services. \nA fourth element to the TQC administration proposed for the .rv1RP is the development of a Mental \nRetardation Planning Council,  hereinafter \"the Council.\"  The mission of the Council '\\-vill be to . \n\npromote public policy,  which  will lead to  the independence,  produ(ti\\'!.ty and  inclusion of i'v1RP \nparticipants in all aspects of society.. This mission will be accomplished ; ~;.rl)ugh planning, evaluation, \ncollaboration, education, research and advocacy.  Once established, the principal effort done by the \nCouncil  will  consist  of identifying  and  evaluating  strategic  issues,  recommend  and  reexamine \npriorities, and devise and review alternatives; all within the scope of the strategic planning process. \nFigureB depicts the conceptual framework underlying this TQC managerial model. \nI  \nI  \nI \nI  \nII  \n~I  \n\nManagement  \nTota'Q~a'iti \nAPPLieD VISION OF TH5 TOTAL Q..'-'\\ALlTy MA/'-JACteM5NT \nPRDPOS5D FOR TH-E ADMINISTRATlv5 R-50RCjANIZ,ATION OF Tf-t5/v \\RP \nIndividua\\ r.-'-~ams \nF-o\\es ~tz.e.sponsihi\\itits \nqua\\itt \nL.ontro\\ \nloob  ..., .:,...._.. -.. \nqua\\it-j \nMana96me.nt \nFun{.;tion \nMaste.r  ~\"P\\anning \nDe.p\\~nt  .  100\\5 \nY\\an \n:.<'.::func:t1o na \n\"\\~p~~nt \nindividual \n~iMmS \n~\\e5 ~ \nC-reanvit-j  '5tratf.9it. \n,.'  1\"oo\\s  'Planning ~ \nAli9nment \n23 \n\nACRo~rrlVIS \nr: \ni' \n::: \nATP  Psychiatrit Therapeutic Assistant (acronyms in Sparush) \n(BSP  Community-Based Service Plan \nCBDC  (orrimunity-Based Developmental Centers \nFSP  Family Support Program  . \nlAP  Individualized Action Plan \nIDT  Interdisciplinary Team \nIHP  Individualized Habilitation Plan \nISP  Individualized Services Plan \nlIP'  Individualized Transition Plan \nl'v'1RP  Mental Retardation Program of the Department ofHealth of Puerto Rico  . \nPCPP  Person-Centered Planning Principles \nSLS  Supported·Living Staff \nSM  Service Mediator' \nVSP  Vocational· Service Pr~gram \n\nREFERENCES \n\nOlmstead v.

Background \n \nSince the inception of this case, the Court has issued a number of different orders to \nensure that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico provides effective protections, services, and \nsupports to meet the individualized needs of persons with developmental disabilities in the \nCommonwealth’s service-delivery system.  The Court has appointed a Joint Compliance \nCoordinator (“JCC”), two assistants, as well as counsel to the JCC, to monitor the \nCommonwealth’s compliance with the terms of the various orders, to work with the parties to \nminimize disputes, and to keep the focus on the Commonwealth developing and implementing \nmeasures to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of persons with developmental disabilities.   \nIn recent years, in collaboration with the Court, the JCC, and the United States, the \nCommonwealth has taken steps to shift from an institutional model to a more integrated \ncommunity-based model of service-delivery.  These integration efforts are not only required by \ncertain orders in this case, they are also consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1795   Filed 03/22/16   Page 2 of 6 \n2 \n\n \nentities, as well as the Supreme Court’s ADA decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 \n(1999), where the Court held that “[u]njustified isolation … is properly regarded as \ndiscrimination based on disability.”   \nFor a more complete summary and description of the existing legal framework in this \ncase, see the background section of the parties’ Joint Compliance Action Plan (“JCAP”), entered \nas an order of the Court on October 19, 2011 (ECF No. 1185-1).    \nII.   Need for Transition Order Protections \nAround the time of the gubernatorial elections in 2008 and 2012, the Court issued \nseparate Transition Orders, with specific language intended to minimize or eliminate the \npotential adverse impact the government administration change could have on the ongoing and \nfuture operations of the Commonwealth’s Intellectual Disability Program (“IDP”) and other \npertinent Commonwealth agencies, and on the essential services provided to persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities through them.  Transition Order, Dec. 10, 2008 (ECF No. 794); \nSupplemental Transition Order, Nov. 12, 2012 (ECF No. 1299).  Specifically, both Transition \nOrders contained provisions that, among other things, prevented the automatic termination of \ncontract personnel that provided needed protections, services, and supports to persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities. \nThe Court remains concerned that, pursuant to local law, and, mainly practice, when \nthere is a change in gubernatorial administrations, Commonwealth contracts automatically \nterminate at the end of the calendar year before the inauguration of the newly-elected Governor.  \nWithout a properly crafted Transition Order to ensure continuity, key contractors in the instant \ncase would be terminated without sufficient, or any, consideration of the potentially dire \nconsequences to the persons with developmental disabilities who need the protections, services, \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1795   Filed 03/22/16   Page 3 of 6 \n3 \n\n \nand supports these contractors provide. Moreover, it could be weeks or even months before \nofficials in the new administration are able to contract with and/or hire replacement personnel; in \nthe interim, persons with developmental disabilities would be vulnerable to not having their \nneeds met and this could violate existing orders in this case.  The Court notes that this is \ntypically not a money issue – in 2008 and 2012, for example, there were sufficient budgeted \nfunds to pay these contractors beyond the end of the calendar year and through the end of the \nfiscal year, which was six months into the administration of the new Governor.    \nIII.  Second Supplemental Transition Order \nThe 2016 gubernatorial election results in Puerto Rico will result in a change in \nadministrations that will prompt the automatic termination of contract employees as referenced \nabove. As in 2008 and 2012, the Court has a similar interest in mitigating circumstances \nassociated with the gubernatorial election that might impede the uninterrupted delivery of needed \nprotections, services, and supports to persons with developmental disabilities in the \nCommonwealth’s service-delivery system.  Therefore, the Court is issuing today a Second \nSupplemental Transition Order, set forth below, to reinforce the importance of the safeguards set \nforth in the previous Transition Orders and to update certain provisions, as appropriate:   \nA.   The Court’s 2008 Transition Order (ECF No. 794) and 2012 Supplemental Transition \nOrder (ECF No. 1299) shall remain in full force and effect to protect persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s system from destabilizing \ninfluences that could imperil their health, safety, and welfare. \n \nB.   Consistent with the two previous Transition Orders, as well as subsequent Court \norders related to maintaining the IDP budget, the Commonwealth shall:  ensure the \ncontinuity and integrity of the protections, services, and supports provided to persons \nwith developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system; \nensure that these protections, services, and supports are not interrupted or diminished; \nand ensure that any progress and momentum toward meeting the needs of these \npersons with developmental disabilities will not be lost.   \n \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1795   Filed 03/22/16   Page 4 of 6 \n4 \n\n \nC.   The Commonwealth presently engages a significant number of contract personnel to \nprovide needed protections, services, and supports to persons with developmental \ndisabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system. As in 2008 and 2012, \nthe Court continues to have a strong interest in ensuring that the continuity and \nintegrity of needed protections, services, and supports not be compromised by the \nautomatic termination of these contract personnel after the election and before the \ninauguration of a new Governor. \n \nD.   Given the essential function of these contractors, the Court hereby orders the \nCommonwealth Department of Health to retain the services of all contract employees \nthat provide protections, services, and supports to persons with developmental \ndisabilities within the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system, until further order of  \nthe Court. This includes the services of attorney Arlene Pérez Borrero, who has \nrepresented the health department for several years and is most familiar with this \ncase.1   \n \nE.   The Commonwealth shall ensure that there are sufficient funds to pay these \ncontractors beyond the end of the 2016 calendar year and through the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year, which ends on June 30, 2017. \n \nF. \t  The provisions of this order should not be interpreted as creating any vested interest \nfor the incumbents in any of the positions within the Commonwealth Department of  \nHealth. To the contrary, the Court recognizes that the incoming administration must \nbe allowed to exercise its widest discretion, so long as the incoming administration \ncomplies with existing orders of the Court to provide needed protections, services, \nand supports to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of persons with developmental \ndisabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system. \n \nG.   Upon motion by the Commonwealth, filed after the inauguration of the new Governor \nin January of 2017, the Court will consider any request to modify, amend, or vacate \npertinent provisions of this order, as appropriate. \n \nH.   The Commonwealth Secretary of Health is hereby ordered to deliver a copy of this \norder to the members of the transition committee for the incoming administration \nduring the Department of Health transition meetings.  \n \nPrior to December 31, 2016, the JCC and the parties shall collaborate, and then inform \nthe Court if necessary, on the need for additional provisions to better ensure the continuity and \n                                                            \n1 Any new attorney will need time to familiarize him  or  herself with this case.  The special needs \npopulation in this case, however, cannot afford any delays because  of this.  Counsel Pérez-Borrero’s presence will \nthus, allow for this much needed continuity during the transition  period.  \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1795   Filed 03/22/16   Page 5 of 6 \n5 \n\n \nintegrity of the protections, services, and supports provided to persons with developmental \ndisabilities during and after the time of transition.  \nThis Second Supplemental Transition Order closely tracks the language, format, \nstructure, and scope of the 2012 Supplemental Transition Order, which was entered without \nobjection by any party. \nThe Court’s 2012 order repeatedly referenced that beneficiaries of the order include all  \npersons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system; there \nwas no language limiting coverage to a select group within the system who at one time lived in a \nCommonwealth institution.  See, e.g., Supplemental Transition Order, Nov. 12, 2012 (ECF No. \n1299) at 3 (“ensure the continuity and integrity of the protections, services, and supports \nprovided to persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery \nsystem”).   \nThis scope is appropriate and consistent with Commonwealth practice, as for years now, \nthe Commonwealth has represented to the Court, the JCC, and the United States, that it does not \nrun a bifurcated DD system where a select few individuals receive greater protections, services, \nand supports than others with similar conditions.  Indeed, as the Court has noted in the past, it \nwould be inequitable and unjust to treat some within the IDP system as “kings” and others as \nsecond-class citizens based on arbitrary criteria.   \nGiven the interests of justice, and given that there is but one IDP and one unitary IDP \nbudget, the Court clarifies that this Second Supplemental Transition Order, once again, includes \nall persons with developmental disabilities in the IDP, and not just those who at one time lived at \na Commonwealth institution.   \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1795   Filed 03/22/16   Page 6 of 6 \n6 \n \nNot only is this consistent with the Supplemental Transition Order, it is consistent with \nthe Court-imposed parameters of the JCAP, where the Court noted at the outset that “the \nCommonwealth has voluntarily assumed additional obligations which benefit all the IDP \npopulation.” JCAP, Oct. 19, 2011 (ECF No. 1185) (emphasis added).  Since the entry of the \nJCAP in 2011, the Court has issued other orders that benefit all persons with developmental \ndisabilities in the Commonwealth’s system.  See, e.g., Order Re: Fiscal Year 2013-14 Budget, \nApr. 30, 2013 (ECF No. 1368) at 1 (directing the Commonwealth to maintain a budget for the \nIDP sufficient to ensure compliance with existing Court Orders in this case and to meet the needs \nof “persons with developmental disabilities in the Commonwealth’s service-delivery system.”). \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n \nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, on this 22nd day of March, 2016. \n \n \n \n \ns/ Gustavo A.

BACKGROUND \nThis Court has repeatedly raised its concerns regarding the Commonwealth’s delayed \npayments to community providers serving people with developmental disabilities (“DD”),1 in \nlight of multiple orders in this case requiring the Commonwealth to provide these people with \nsupports and services sufficient to meet their needs.  In the face of these delays, see Joint \nCompliance Coordinator (“JCC”) Resp. to Commonw.’s Informative Mot., Apr. 22, 2016, ECF \nNo. 1824 and United States’ Resp. to Defs.’ Informative Mot., Apr. 22, 2016, ECF No. 1823, the \nCourt put the Commonwealth on notice that the Court was prepared, if necessary, to issue a \ngarnishment order to escrow funds from the Commonwealth to ensure future timely payments to \n1 The Court stated that it would issue “any and all corresponding orders to ensure that the \nparticipants are not left without essential services.”  Order, Apr. 9, 2016, ECF No. 1802.  The \nCourt also stressed that “[u]nder no circumstances can the services to the participants be \ncurtailed, and institutionalization is not an alternative.”  Order, Apr. 8, 2016, ECF No. 1799.  The \nCourt emphasized that it “will issue any appropriate relief warranted to ensure the participants’ \nwelfare.”  Order, Apr. 11, 2016, ECF No. 1815.   \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1838   Filed 05/11/16   Page 2 of 5\ncommunity providers serving people with DD in the Commonwealth’s system.  Order, Apr. 22, \n2016, ECF No. 1825.  The Court stressed that late payments to DD providers have a direct \nnegative impact on individuals served in the community and that the effect on them can be \n“devastating and beyond repair.”  Id.  In furtherance of its Order, the Court scheduled an \nemergency hearing and conference for the parties to address the causes of the late payments to \nDD providers.  Orders, Apr. 22, 2016, ECF Nos. 1825, 1827.   \nOn April 26, 2016, the parties met in the Court’s chambers.  On behalf of the JCC, the \nHon. Federico Hernandez-Denton chaired the meeting.  In addition to counsel for the parties, \nparticipants included the Attorney General of Puerto Rico, the Hon. Cesar Miranda; the \nCommonwealth Secretary of the Treasury, the Hon. Juan Zaragoza; the Commonwealth \nSecretary of Health, the Hon. Ana Rius, M.D.; and the Director of the Puerto Rico Office of \nManagement and Budget, Mr. Luis Cruz.  Following their meeting, the parties reported to the \nCourt in a brief hearing that they had agreed on measures to ensure payment to DD providers in a \ntimely manner to minimize the prospect of providers closing community homes due to late \npayment of invoices.   \nThe Court was informed of the particular aspects of the agreement, as well as the firm \ncommitment of the foregoing senior Commonwealth officials to ensure payment to DD providers \nin a timely manner.  In particular, these officials all agreed that services for individuals with DD \nare essential under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, that failure to make \ntimely payments for these services would place the health, safety, and welfare of people with DD \nin jeopardy, and that invoices for these essential services will be given priority status for \npayment and shall be paid in a timely manner, regardless of the current fiscal crisis.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1838   Filed 05/11/16   Page 3 of 5\nAfter underscoring its previously stated concerns about delayed payments to DD \nproviders and the potential harm to people served by those providers, this Court preliminarily \nendorsed the proposed agreement of the parties and directed the parties to promptly submit a \njoint proposed order memorializing the agreement for the Court to enter as an order.  Mins. of \nProceedings, Apr. 26, 2016, ECF No. 1832. \nThe Commonwealth then filed a motion for additional time within which to reach \nagreement with the United States on outstanding provider payment issues.  Mot. Req’g \nExtension of Time, May 3, 2016, ECF No. 1833.  The next day, the Court granted the motion, \nsetting a final deadline of May 10, 2016.  Order, May 4, 2016, ECF No. 1834.   \nOn May 10, 2016, the United States filed a joint proposed order on behalf of the parties.  \nAs set forth below, the parties’ joint proposal is consistent with the oral agreement presented to \nthe Court at the April hearing, but it differs in two respects:  1) the timeframe within which to \neffect payments to providers has been reduced from 45 days to 35 days; and 2) the \nCommonwealth will not make electronic deposits in the short term, but commits to develop and \nimplement a centralized accounting system to enable direct electronic deposits going forward.   \nThe Court has reviewed the parties’ joint proposal and, for good cause shown, now orders \nas follows:   \nII.  REMEDIAL ORDER TO ENSURE TIMELY PROSPECTIVE PAYMENTS TO \nPROVIDERS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELFARE OF PEOPLE \nWITH DD SERVED BY THOSE PROVIDERS \n \nA.  Protections, services, and supports to meet the individualized needs of people \nwith DD are “essential services” per existing Court orders in this case.  Invoices \nfor these essential services shall be given priority status for payment and must be \npaid in a timely manner consistent with the terms set forth below regardless of \nany fiscal crisis or liquidity problems. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1838   Filed 05/11/16   Page 4 of 5\nB.  Individuals with DD currently living in integrated community settings shall not be \nplaced in institutional settings as a response to fiscal constraints; instead, the \nCommonwealth shall ensure that there are sufficient protections, services, and \nsupports to meet their needs in integrated community settings.  \nC.  Pursuant to the Joint Compliance Action Plan (“JCAP”), the Commonwealth is \nobligated to pay DD providers on time each month for legitimate invoices.  JCAP, \nOct. 19, 2011, ECF No. 1185-1, at 6.  To comply with this requirement, the \nCommonwealth shall ensure that within 35 calendar days of receipt of a provider \ninvoice by the Commonwealth’s Intellectual Disabilities Program (“IDP”), each DD \nprovider receives payment of the full base amount for all individuals with DD served \nthat month by the provider.  The base amount is that fixed, recurring monthly amount \nset forth in the provider contract for each individual with DD, exclusive of other \nvariable expenses that may arise in any given month for medications, health care co-\npayments, hospital costs, and other miscellaneous costs; the base amount is often the \nonly amount included in a monthly provider invoice.  The Commonwealth shall \nensure that each DD provider receives payment of this full base amount for all \nindividuals with DD served that month by the provider within the 35-day period.  The \nguaranteed, automatic receipt of these base amounts on or before the 35-day deadline \nwill help ensure that DD providers will not be forced to close a community home due \nto late payment of invoices. \nD.  If the Commonwealth fails to provide full base payments to any DD provider within \nthe 35-day period, the Commonwealth shall provide written notice to the JCC and the \nUnited States, within three business days of the missed deadline, specifying the name \nof each provider not paid in a timely manner, along with the 35-day payment due date \nassociated with each invoice, and the amount that has not been paid within the 35-day \nperiod. \nE.  The Commonwealth shall take all necessary steps to review, process, approve, and \npay any variable non-base expenses within 35 days of receipt of the DD provider \ninvoice.  As is current practice, DD providers shall only be required to submit one \nmonthly invoice that contains line items for both the base amounts and variable \nexpenses, if any. \nF.  In order to shorten and streamline the DD provider invoice/payment process, the \nCommonwealth shall take the following steps: \n1. The Commonwealth shall accept receipt of DD provider invoices via electronic\ntransmission, such as by email or photographic image sent by a smart phone.\nSubmission by these or other equivalent means shall constitute proper “receipt” of\na provider invoice by the IDP.  For those providers that do not currently have the\ntechnological capability to submit invoices via electronic transmission, the\nCommonwealth shall take effective steps to facilitate prompt receipt of invoices\nby other means.\n4 \n\nCase 3:99-cv-01435-GAG-MEL   Document 1838   Filed 05/11/16   Page 5 of 5\n2. The Commonwealth shall ensure that review, processing, and approval of each\nDD provider invoice by the IDP and the Finance Office of the Commonwealth’s\nDepartment of Health collectively will be finalized within 15 days of receipt of\nthe provider invoice by the IDP.\n3. As soon as it is feasible, the Commonwealth commits to developing and\nimplementing an effective system to enable prompt electronic direct deposit of\npayment to DD providers on provider invoices.  Upon implementing such a\nsystem, the Commonwealth shall take all necessary steps to obtain provider\napproval, as well as financial institution routing numbers and other pertinent\ndetails, so as to ensure safe, secure, and prompt payment to DD providers via\ndirect deposit.\nG.  The Commonwealth and its Office of Management and Budget confirms that it has \nreleased the “reserves” attached to budgetary funding for the IDP, including the \napproximately five million dollars designated for reserve in the current fiscal year.  \nConsistent with prior orders of this Court, the parties recognize that any reduction to \nor other constraint on the budget of the IDP could cause the interruption of critical \nservices that would violate a host of Court orders in this case and would imperil the \nhealth, safety, and welfare of vulnerable people with disabilities.  See Order, Apr. 30, \n2013, ECF No. 1368 (“[a]ny reduction in the [IDP] budget could cause the \ninterruption of critical services that would imperil the health, safety, and welfare of \nvulnerable persons with disabilities”).  Per the Court’s directive at the emergency \nhearing on April 26, 2016, the parties will develop and file with the Court a joint plan \nto prevent future reductions to or constraints on the budget of the IDP. \nH.  This order, as well as all prior Court orders in this case, shall have ongoing effect and \nshall apply not only to the current Commonwealth administration, but to all \nsubsequent Commonwealth administrations.  The Court has repeatedly stressed in its \nmany transition orders over the years the need for continuity across administrations in \ncomplying with its orders.  See, e.g., Second Supp. Transition Order, Mar. 22, 2016, \nECF No. 1795.     \nSO ORDERED. \nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, on this 11th day of May, 2016. \ns/ Gustavo A. Gelpí\nGUSTAVO A.
