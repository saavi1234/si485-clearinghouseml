    "summary": "<p>On December 22, 1995, People First of Tennessee filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against the State of Tennessee on behalf of residents of the Clover Bottom Developmental Center, Greene Valley Developmental Center, and Winston Developmental Center. The plaintiff sued the Clover Bottom Development Center and the Tennessee Department of Health under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The complaint alleged that a Department of Justice CRIPA investigation of the facilities in 1994 found a pattern of injury, abuse, and neglect, deficient medical care, a lack of activities, and a failure to provide educations to school-age children as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It also alleged the use of unnecessary restraints, inadequate discharge planning, and failure to provide habilitation and training. The People First of Tennessee, represented by the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia and private counsel, sought injunctive relief to permanently enjoin the defendants from continuing the acts, practices, and omissions described above.</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 1996, the United States Department of Justice also filed a lawsuit in the Middle District of Tennessee against the state, alleging similar violations. That case was styled <a href=\"../../../../case/502/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. v. Tennessee</a> Civ. No. 96-cv-01056 (M.D.Tenn.) (\"United States case\").</p>\r\n<p>On December 2, 1996, the district court (Judge Robert L. Echnols) granted a motion to consolidate the People First case with the United States case.</p>\r\n<p>People First, the Department of Justice, and the State of Tennessee entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by Judge Echnols on November 27, 1996. In the settlement, the state agreed to, among other things:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Create person-centered evaluation of citizens in need of services</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Develop community programs and resources</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Increase staffing and staff training</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Improve living conditions in the centers</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Provide education for school-age residents</p>\r\n<p>On the same date, the court granted plaintiff People First of Tennessee's motion to amend their complaint.</p>\r\n<p>According to the PACER docket, litigation continued after the settlement regarding defendants' compliance with the settlement agreement, the Parent-Guardian Association's (PGA) intervention in the action, and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>Community Rehabilitation Agencies of Tennessee (CMRA), an association of agencies providing services to individuals with intellectual disabilities, moved to intervene in the consolidate suits. The court (Judge Jon McCalla) denied the motions for each case. On August 8, 2001, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (District Judge John Feikens, Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation) affirmed the denials. U.S. v. Tennessee, 260 F.3d 587 (6th Cir. 2001).</p>\r\n<p>On Mar. 18, 2002, the court ordered the case administratively closed in light of the ongoing settlement process. The court allowed the case to be reopened by either party.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reopened on Feb. 22, 2006 to address the state's motion for partial termination of the settlement regarding Greene Valley Developmental Center. The settlement agreement allowed the state to seek partial termination of the agreement after two years if the state showed compliance with provisions related to institutional care services and protection from harm. The court had to address if \"the State has substantially complied with\" the provisions. The court granted the motion on Mar. 16, 2006, finding that the state had achieved compliance with respect to the conditions at the Greene Valley Developmental Center.</p>\r\n<p>The court terminated the settlement agreement with respect to the Harold Jordan Center on Sept. 30, 2008, finding that the state showed compliance with provisions related to institutional care services and protection from harm at that particular facility.</p>\r\n<p>The court once again ordered the case administratively closed on Mar. 31, 2009. While the case remained closed, a series of procedural developments occurred. First, on Nov. 19, the state indicated that budgetary considerations compelled it to close the Clover Bottom Developmental Center and Harold Jordan Center. On Dec. 21, 2009, the PGA filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in response to the state's asserted intent to close the facilities without a comprehensive closure plan. The court denied the motion on Jan. 12, 2010, holding that the parties did not make a sufficient effort to confer with the state, as required by the settlement agreement, before bringing their motion.</p>\r\n<p>After many months of negotiation, the parties drafted an exit plan that established criteria that, if the state satisfied, would result in a dismissal of this case. The court approved the exit plan on Jan. 29, 2015. A year later, on Jan. 12, 2016, the court found that the state had complied with the exit plan provisions and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice. The court also vacated previously-granted injunctive relief, except as to class members residing at Greene Valley Developmental Center while they continued to reside there. The court maintained jurisdiction over the matter only as to these residents. On Sept. 8, 2017, after the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the case as to the outstanding injunction, the court dismissed the case with prejudice, finding that the state was in full compliance with the exit plan as to Greene Valley Developmental Center.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the course of this litigation, the court awarded installments of attorneys' fees and reimbursements totaling $2,778,833.84 for the plaintiffs and $753,433.86 for the PGA.</p>\r\n<p>The case was then closed, though the court currently retained jurisdiction solely over matters related to attorneys' fees. On November 9, 2017, People First filed a final motion for attorneys' fees. The PGA filed a similar motion the following day. On November 14, 2017, the court granted both motions, awarding People First $377,944.28 and PGA $65,750. All motions for attorneys' fees have been resolved. The case is presumably closed.</p>",

[See Agreed Order at ECF No. \n1138 (the “Agreed Order”) and Exit Plan at ECF No. 1138-1 (the “Exit Plan”)].  The Agreed \nOrder includes a provision that requires the Court to “enter an order vacating all outstanding \ninjunctive relief in the [captioned matter] except that relief that applies to Greene Valley \nDevelopmental Center … and dismissing the [captioned matter] with prejudice and in all \nrespects except as to any then existing orders relating to the provision of services to class \n1 \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1162   Filed 01/15/16   Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 6303\n\nmembers while residing in GVDC” upon the State completing all material provisions of Sections \nII-IX of the Exit Plan.  [See Agreed Order at ¶2]. \nBefore the Court is the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Barbara D. \nHolmes, entered December 11, 2015, recommending the Court find that Defendants have \ncomplied with all material provisions of Sections II-IX of the Exit Plan.  [See ECF No. 1158] \n(the “December 11 R&R”).  The December 11 R&R specifically finds that Defendants have \ncomplied with and completed Section IV.E, Section VI.B, Section VII.B, and, Section IX of the \nExit Plan.  Id. at p. 2 (adopted by the Court, ECF No. 1160).  In addition, based upon the Court’s \nprevious findings of State compliance with all of the other material provisions of Sections II-IX \nof the Exit Plan (see Report and Recommendation, ECF No. 1141, adopted by the Court, ECF \nNo. 1160; Report and Recommendation, ECF No. 1145, adopted by the Court, ECF No. 1153; \nReport and Recommendation, ECF No. 1147, adopted by the Court, ECF No. 1153; Report and \nRecommendation, ECF. No. 1149, adopted by the Court, ECF No. 1160; Report and \nRecommendation, ECF No. 1155, adopted by the Court, ECF No. 1159; and, Report and \nRecommendation, ECF No. 1157, adopted by the Court, ECF No. 1159), the December 11 R&R \nrecommends the Court find Defendants have complied with all material provisions of Sections \nII-IX of the Exit Plan. \nNo objections to the December 11 R&R, or any of the other cited Report and \nRecommendations, have been filed, and the time for filing objections has expired. \nOn de novo review of the Magistrate Judge’s December Report and Recommendation, \nthe Court hereby ADOPTS the December 11 R&R.

The Court further FINDS that Defendants have complied with and completed all \nmaterial provisions of Sections II-IX of the Exit Plan. \nThe Court also notes that Clover Bottom Developmental Center was closed on November \n19, 2015, when the final six class members residing there transitioned to community homes.  In \naddition, since the entry of the Agreed Order, over twenty class members residing in Greene \nValley Developmental Center (“GVDC”) have transitioned to homes in the community.  Under \nthe terms of the Exit Plan and Agreed Order, Defendants continue to have obligations to class \nmembers residing at GVDC pursuant to Section X.D through X.F of the Exit Plan, and Sections \nV.A.5 and V.A.9 of the original Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement was \nunconditionally approved by the Court via an order entered on November 23, 1999 at Doc. No. \n326).  Moreover, after a class member transitions out of GVDC, the State is obligated to fulfill its \nresponsibilities pursuant to Section X.G of the Exit Plan.  \nBased on these findings and the entire record in this cause, IT IS ORDERED, \nADJUDGED AND DECREED that:  \n1.  Pursuant to Paragraphs 2 and 8 of the Agreed Order approving the Exit Plan, all \noutstanding injunctive relief heretofore entered in this case is hereby VACATED except for the \ninjunctive relief that applies to GVDC and any class member residing therein while they reside \ntherein; \n2.  Pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 8 of the Agreed Order approving the Exit Plan, this case is \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE in all respects except as to any existing orders relating to the \nprovision of services to class members residing in GVDC; \n3.

PEOPLE  FIRST  OF  TENNESSEE  is a  state  wide  advocacy  organization  governed\nentirely  bv people with  disabilities.  It was founded  in  1981 and  was incorporated  in  1%4  as a\nnon-profit  corporation  under  tiie laws of the Slate of Tennessee.  People First of Tennessee  has\nmore  than  1000  members,  all  of  them  persons  with  disabilities,  in  40  chapters  and  support\ngroups  in 31 counties across  the state.\n~\\ The purposes of People First of Tennessee,  for  which  it expends us resources,  are as\ntoilnws:\n(a)  To promote the philosophy  that everyone, no matter what disability  he or siie\n;as or its severity,  has the same basic civil  rights and  responsibilities;\n(b)  To advocate and defend  the rights of persons with disabilities in the areas of\namplovment,  education,  housing  and  transportation;\n(c)  To  provide  a way  for  persons  with  disabilities  to express  and  remedy  their\nconcerns and  enhance  their  well-being.\n\nlegislation  to enable  i ennesseeans with disabilities to live more independently.

They  represent  Tennesseeans  with  disabilities  bv  serving  on\nregional,  state and  national  committees  including  the  State  Advisory  Planning  Council  tot  the\nDepartment  oi  Mental  Retardation.  They  conduct  local,  regional  and  state-wide  conferences,\nmeetings and  training  programs.\n9.  In  1989,  Governor  Ned  McWherter  issued  a proclamation  recognizing  People  First\nlor Outstanding Semce to Tennessee.  In 1990, People First of Tennessee received the Nashville\nMayor's  Award  for  Outstanding  Organization  Serving  People  With  Disabilities;  in  1994,  the\norganization received the  Nashville Mayor's Advisory Committee Award.  In  1995. People First\nreceived  the J.C.  Penney  Golden  Rule  Award.\n10.  In  1991, People  First  of Tennessee  organized  and  hosted  a nation-wide  conference\nof self-advocacy  organizations;  at this conference,  a national  organization  of self-advocacy  or\n\"People  First\" organizations was founded  named Self-Advocates  Becoming  Empowered.  Since\nthat time, members of People First have been appointed to the President's Committee on  Mental\nRetardation and the board of directors of the American  Association  on  Mental  Retardation,  one\nof the leading professional  organizations in the field of developmental disabilities.  A Tennessee\nmember  served  as  a  regional  representative  on  the  National  Committee  of  Self-Advocates\nBecoming  Empowered;  a  member  of  People  First  of Tennessee  was  chosen  to honor  Senator\nFrist upon his appointment to the chairmanship of the Senate Sub-committee on Disability Issues,\n\nand  members  were  invited  bv  President  (\"Union  to  tlie  5th  anniversarv  celebration  or  *:u\nanniversary  ot  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act.

The  name  \"People  First\"  was  conceived  by  the  members  of  People  First\nInternational, which was founded  in  1974 by residents of the Fairview Training Center, a state\ninstitution for persons with retardation in Oregon.  In discussing the selection of a name, one of\nthe members said, \"Why not call ourselves People First, because we want to be known as people-\nbefore we're known  for our handicap?\"  After  that.  People First organizations were formed m\nmany  other  states,  including  Tennessee.  All  share  the  common  purpose  of  supporting  their\nmembers' right to speak for themselves, to make their own decisions, and to know and exercise\ntheir rights as citizens, including their right to live in the community.\n12.  People  First  has  many  members  who  live  at  all  three  defendant  developmental\ncenters.  Beginning in 1984, members of the local Nashville chapter decided to conduct outreach\nto individuals residing at Clover Bottom. Since that time many individuals from Clover Bottom.\nGreene Valley and Nat T. Winston have become People First members and have attended local\nmeetings.  Members who reside at Clover Bottom Developmental Center  have  attended public\nhearings on efforts  to limit  the size of residential  programs.  They have been elected  to local\nchapter  leadership  positions  and  one  individual  has  served  on  the  organization's  board  of\ndirectors in the past.\n\napproximately  fifteen  years.  She  lives  in  Magnolia,  a larce  buiidini;  w;;h\nClover Bottom because she had challenging behavior, and because defendants  served people with\nher disabilities only at  institutions  like Clover  Bottom,\n14.  Ms,  Chaffee  is  a  capable  woman  with  good  communication  skills.  She  has  been\nlabelled  moderately  retarded.  She  attends  People  First  meetings  regularly.  She  has  slated  at\nevery  recent  People  I-'irst  meeting  that  she wants  to leave  Clover  Bottom  and  live  in a  normal\nhome  in the community.  In the past,  she was placed  in a group home but  the placement  tailed\nbecause the home was, m ellect. a mini-institution  with  many residents, was not staffed  to meet\nher  needs,  and  was  funded  far  below  the  level  of Clover  Bottom.  Defendants*  \"cookie-cutter\"\napproach  to community  services denied  Ms.  Chaffee  the individualized  services  she  needed.\n15.Ms. Chaffee  has been recommended  for community placement;  however, she remains\nat  the  institution  because  the  community  service  system  operated  by  defendants  poses  many\nbarriers  to her  successful  placement.  Those  barriers  include  the defendants'  failure  to  develop\nsupported  employment  and  other  daytime  services  for  persons  living  in  the community;  their\nfailure  to develop  residential  support  services  for  people  with  significant  disabilities  and  need\nfor  behavioral  support:  and  their  failure  to make  training  and  technical  assistance  available  to\npeople  who work  in the community  service  system.\n16.  Ms. Chaffee  lacks meaningful  employment  training opportunities at Clover  Bottom.\nShe attends a sheltered  workshop on campus,  where she spends about  six hours a day.  much of\n\nit dead  lime  wuh  nothing  to  do.  the  rest  o;  it  repetitive  assembly  work  fur  minima;  •.•-.•..•.iie>.

Bonnie  Cnatiee  experiences,  on  a daily  basis,  the harmful  and  unlawful  conditions\ndescribed  in  paragraphs  12B-244  below.  Because  of  defendants'  failure  io  provide\nindividualized services in the community,  she has been unnecessarily  confined  at Clover  Bottom.\n18. DOWELL  HARRIS  is a man of middle age who has been  institutionalized  at Clover\nBottom  for  many  years.  He  lives  in  the  Spruce  building,  in  a  \"behavior  unit\"  where  he  is\ncongregated  together  with  other  men  who  are  considered  \"lower  functioning  ambulatory\"\nresidents  with  behavior  problems.  He has  little opportunity  to model  appropriate  behavior  or\nto learn  how  to act  in the community;  instead,  he is exposed  without  respite  to persons  whose\nbehavior  is at least  at problematic  as his own.  He and  the other  men  in his unit  have little  or\nno choice  about  when  to  wake  up and  go  to bed,  or  what  to eat.  He  has  no  family  who  are\ninvolved in his life and has not received a Christmas card  from  a friend  in at least twenty years.\n19. Mr.  Harris has multiple disabilities. He does not say many words clearly, and he has\nvisual  difficulties.  He walks with a hunched-over  gait.  He has difficulty  with activities of daily\nliving.  He  engages  in  stereotypical,  perseverative  behavior  that  is  the  result  of  his  king\ninstitutionalization.  The  irony  is  that  because  of  the  disabilities  that  were  created  in  part  bv\ninstitutionalization,  he  is  now  considered  to  be  completely  inappropriate  for  community\nplacement.  Defendants  refuse  to consider him  for the community on the ground  that he  requires\ntoo much  support—support  they  have chosen  to provide only  at Clover  Bottom.\n20.  Mr.  Harris  rarely  leaves  his residential  unit—he  is in the Spruce  building  24  hours\n\na  dav  for  weeks  at  a  nine,  lie  has  little  or  no  opponunitv  to  practice  ^ojuooik;'  :-K\\,  •-\nrecreational  skills  or  community  living,  skills,  ilis  environment  is  barren,  monotonous  and\nunpleasant:  he is condemned  to live without  hope or  companionship.\n21.  Dowtil  Harris  experiences,  on  a dailv  basis,  the  liarmful  and  unlawful  conditions\ndescribed  in  paragraphs  128-249  below.  Because defendants  limit  their community  sen ices to\npersons  who do not  have  his behavioral  disabilities,  he has no alternative  to Clover  Bottom.\n22. EFFIE IZSTELLE PIPPIN  will be 44 vears old on December 23,  N95. She has lived\nat Clover Bottom  lor nearly  twenty years. She lives in Magnolia,  tier parents are deceased.  She\nhas  a  brother  who  does  not  visit  or  send  cards  or  letters,  and  a  sister  who  has  only  limited\ncontact with  her.  She attended public school for a time but left while she was still in elementary\nschool.\n23.  Ms.  Pippin  is capable  and  articulate  and  states that  she would  like  to leave  Clover\nBottom and move to her own apartment.  She is an active member of People First of Tennessee.\nWith  training and support  she could easily work at a real job and use public transportation.  She\nlias  been  labelled  mildly  or  moderately  retarded.  She  has  hemipiegia  and  has  some  difficultv\nwalking,  which  places her at risk of  falling  and  injuring  herself.  In the last year  she has had a\nbroken  toot  and  a sprained  ankle.  She has been  denied  adequate dental  care at Clover  Bottom.\n24.  Ms. Pippin has been hit frequently  by other Clover Bottom residents. At People First\nmeetings,  she has been observed  to have bruises that Clover  Bottom  staff  could  not  adequately\nexplain.  She has also been  the recipient  of  forced  sexual  attention  at Clover  Bottom.\n25.  In  the  past,  Ms.  Pippin  has  been  placed  in  group  homes  in  the  community,  but\ndefendants'  one-size-fits-all  approach  to community  services did  not meet her individual  needs.\n10\n\nAs a result,  she was returned  to Closer  Bottom.\n26.  Effie  Pippin  experiences,  on  a\ndescribed in paragraphs  128-240 below.  Because of defendants'  fai I lire to provide  individualized\nservices  in the community,  she has been  unnecessarily  confined  at Closer  Bottom.\n27.  SANDRA  JO PROCTOR  is 46 years old and  has lived at Clover  Bottom  for  more\nthan  twenty  years.  She lives  in  Harrison  Hall,  a large  building  composed  of  several  wards  in\nwhich  twelve  to  fifteen  people  share  living  space  and  bathroom  facilities.  Until  recently  Ms,\nProctor  hardly  ever  left  her building; even  now,  she spends  most of her time on  the  unit.\n28.  28. Ms.  Proctor does not  speak but understands others when  they speak to her.  She can\nwalk,  feed  herself and make known her choices and preferences.  She has been  labelled  severely\nand  profoundly  retarded.\n29.  Ms.  Proctor  is not  receiving  adequate  habilitation  at  Clover  Bottom.  She  docs  not\nhave  access  to  meaningful  activities,  vocational  training,  or  the  opportunity  to  learn  real-life\nskills  in  the natural  environments  where  those  skills are practiced.  She  lives  in a barren  ward\nwith  stark,  institutional  furniture,  a television  blaring  for  most of the day,  and  little else to do.\n30.  Ms. Proctor has been denied community  placement because of challenging  behavior.\nWith  proper  support  and  training,  however,  she  could  learn  how  to  act  appropriately  in  the\ncommunity, where she could also receive much richer and more meaningful  habilitative services.\nHowever,  the staff  support  she needs  would  cost  more  than  the defendants'  cost  ceiling  under\nthe home and community based waiver. That ceiling-$107 per day-is significantly  less than the\n$180 per diem  cost of care at (\"lover  Bottom.\n31.  Sandra Jo Proctor experiences, on a dailv basis, the harmful  and unlawful  conditions\nII\n\npersons  who do IHU have  her beha\\iorai  disapiiniev  siic- iias no ^icr;vi;w  to C 'o-er  R.x;o^.\n L\n32.

She  has  received  many  psycho-active  and  other\nmedications at the institution,  including Valium,  Hakioi. Thorazine.  Mellaril.  Loxitane. chloral\nhvdrate. diphenhvdramine. Trilafon.  Benadryl, Ditropan, Ativan, Tegretol, Zantac, arid Senokoi.\nSome  of  these  medications  have caused  serious  side-effects;  for  example,  she has  experienced\ninvoluntary  muscular  movements  due  to  repeated  doses  of  Loxiiane,  and  has  suffered  rapid\nweight  loss as a reaction  to  medication.\n34.  In  198\"7,  Ms.  Sommerville  was  admitted  to  Vanderbilt  Hospital  for  phenobarbital\nmijestion.  At the time, she was not supposed to be taking anv barbiturates.  When Clover  Bottom\nstaff  queried  the  hospital  whether  the test  result  that  showed  phenobarbital  in  her  blood  could\nhave been  a false positive,  further  specialized  assays  w:ere done and  the drug  was identified  as\nphenobarbital.\n35.  Cynthia  Sommerville  has experienced  sexual abuse and  injury  at Clover  Bottom.  In\n1QQi   psychologist  at  the  institution  called  Cynthia's  mother  and  informed  her  that  her\n  a\n12\n\ndaughter  had bruising  on  her upper inner thighs nca:  the gemtais aiu: recommended  t:;,i:  - :.

The institution  explained  that  these bruises were a result o!\" naving\nbeen  lifted  and  moved  bv a direct  care  staff.\n3(,  On  March  10,  1992, Ms, Sommerville was taken to Nashville General  Hospital  with\ntwo  sets of  bruises  to be evaluated  for  possible  abuse-  She  was  referred  to the  Department  o\\\nHuman  Services and  \"Our  Kids,\" a program  lor children  who may have been  sexually  abused.\nThe  hospital  was  unable  to confirm  or deny  physical  abuse.  However,  she was  tound  to  have\n\"significant  bruising  of at least  two ages consistent  with  recent  falls and/or  blunt  trauma\"  Her\nmother  had  found  bruises on  her lower back and dried  blood  on  her inner  thighs when  visiting\nto check  on  her.\n37.  On  March  25,  1992,  Ms.  Sommerville  was  again  seen  at  General  Hospital  for\nassessment  of  possible  sexual  abuse.  At  that  time,  a  report  was  made  to  the  Department  ot\nHuman  Services.\n38.  On  Angus! 21,  1993. Ms.  Sommerville  was the victim of an assault and  battery  by\nan  unknown  person  or  persons  at  Clover  Bottom.  She  was  found  with  severe  bruises  and\nswelling  o\\  her arms and  knees. The  injury  was  not reported  to Ms. Sommerville's  mother  in\na timely  fashion.\n39  Qn December  8,  1993, some time between  8 and  10 PM,  Cynthia Sommerville  was\nsexually  assaulted.  When  she was bathed  at 8 PM,  staff  noticed  no bruises.  At  10 PM.  a  staff\nperson  checked  Ms.  Sommervilie's  bed,  noticed  that  the covers  needed  adjusting,  and  found\nCynthia  with  bruising  on  the  left  inner  thigh  close  to  the  vaginal  area  and  a  heavy  vagina!\n13\n\ndischarge  on  the  buttocks,  vagina!  area  ami  sheets  A  nurse  was  summoned  ana  M;-.\nSommerville was taken to the infirmary  and from  there she was transported to Nashune  General\nHospital.  The  nurse  called  Kathy  Sommerville.  and  told  her  thai  she  couid  not  rule  out  the\npossibility that \"something  had liappened to jCynliiiaj.\" Clover Hottoni staff reported  to Genera!\nHospital staff that Cynthia had a copious white and yellow vaginal discharge, a strong bods  odor\ndespite having been  bathed only a few  hours before,  and  fresh  bruising.  However,  between  the\ntime the injuries  were discovered  and the time Cynthia arrived at the infirmarv.  staff  must  have\ncleaned  her  up  to  eliminate  signs  of  sexual  abuse  because  the  physician  on  duty  found  no\ndischarge. The institution  found  that several violations of procedure had occurred  uring the time\nthe  injuries  would  have  to  have  occurred  and  that  staff  were  not  working  in  their  assigned\nplaces. Clover  Bottom  staff  concluded  that the injuries  were either  \"self-inflicted\"  or caused by\nsomeone else. General  Hospital expressed concern  that there was no explanation  for  the bruises\nor  discharge.\n40.  Cynthia  Sommerville  has experienced,  on  a daily  basis,  the  harmful  and  unlawful\nconditions described in paragraphs  128-249 below.  Because defendants limited their community\nservices  to  persons  who  do  not  have  her  significant  and  multiple  disabilities,  she  had  no\nalternative  to Clover  Bottom  until  after  this case was  filed.\n41.

Acts 561,\nch.  150.  In the Act. the legislature actively inculcated fear of retarded people as dangerous. The\nAct  required  counlv  health officers  and county  superintendents of education  to \"file  application\ntor the commitment  of  feeble-minded  persons whose parents or guardians  neglect  such  duty  ...\nwhenever such officer  shall  have reasonable cause to believe that such commitment  is necessary\nto secure the welfare  of such  feeble-minded  persons or of the persons with whom  they come in\ncontact.\"  id.  § S (emphasis  added).  The  Act  applied  to  \"am  person  with  such  a  degree  of\nmental  defectiveness\"  as to be  \"a menace to she community.\"  Id.  8 2 (emphasis added).  State\nofficials  supported  the legislation  and  echoed  the conviction  that persons  with  retardation  were\na  threat  to  \"normal\"  people,  stating  that  \"there  are  very  many  feeble-minded  in  the  Stale  of\n\nTennessee who have never gotten into one of the State institutions and are more or :c« ?.. rie:.,Kv\nand  burden  to  their  respective  communities.\"  1 O.

There  are\ncurrently  484  residents at Greene  Valley.\n123.  Class  members  are  or  have  been  institutionalized  at  state  developmental  centers\nbecause  of defendants'  failure  to serve  persons with  severe and  profound  retardation,  physical\ndisabilities, challenging  behavior and other severe disabilities  in communitv-integrated  sen ices\nand  settings.  Many  class  members  were  admitted  to  these  developmental  centers  after  their\nfamilies  sought  services in community-based  programs, but were denied because the person  had\nsevere and  profound  retardation  or a physical  or behavioral  disability.\n124. Other class members came to the developmental centers after being discharged  from\na group  home.  Defendants'  contractors,  the community  providers,  routinely  discharge  group\nhome  residents  when  they  begin  to present  behavioral  difficulties.  Defendants  fail  to  prevent\nthis  practice  or  to  ensure  that  group  home  residents  are  not  discharged  without  adequate\nprocedural  clue process.\n125.  Many  class  members  were  placed  at  developmental  centers  because  they  are\nclassified,  in accordance  with  defendants'  system  tor  ranking  people  with  disabilities  by  their\n34\n\nlevel  of  functioning,  at  \"Level  One\"—the  lowest  level.  Defendants  disproportionate;1,  enn;:^:;\npersons classified  \"Level  One\" to institutions  rather than  normal,  familv-seale  homes,  although\npersons  with  the  most  significant  disabilities  have  the  greatest  need  for  the  individualized\nservices and close  personal  attention  that  is possible only  in small  settings.\n126.  Prior  to  their  placement  at  the  defendant  institutions,  class  members  are  not\ninformed  of any  feasible alternatives available  under the Medicaid  Waiver  Program  and  neither\nare they given  the choice of either  institutional  or  home and  community-based  services.\n127.  Prejudice  and  stereotype continue to support the segregation  of people with  severe\ndisabilities  in state institutions,  away  from  the rest of  us.\nThe  Harmful  Conditions  Imposed  Upon  Residents\n128.  Clover  Bottom,  Greene  Valley  and  Nat T.  Wilson  are  \"total  institutions,\"  where\nrecreational activities, social activities, and medical care are provided  in the same facility  where\nresidents sleep and eat.  The institutions' self-contained  character inhibits meaningful  community\ninvolvement;  many  residents never  leave the  facilities  or their  respective  living  units at all.\n129. At the defendant  state institutions, plaintiffs  spend their days waiting out the hours.\nThey  sprawl  in  ill-fitting  wheelchairs  or  carts.  They  are  parked  in  dayrooms  or  hallways\nunattended,  or are left alone in their rooms.  Many plaintiffs  languish  in hospital  beds or cribs,\nwith  no  stimulation  except  when  they  are  changed  or  fed.  Others  are  left  in  wheelchairs,\nunattended  for  hours,  with  no  stimulation  or  human  contact  available  to  them.  Interaction\nbetween  staff  and  residents is  minimal.\n130.  The  physical  environment  at  the  developmental  centers  was  designed  for  mass\nmanagement  and  custodial  care.  Their  architecture  cannot  be adapted  to the habilitative  needs\n35\n\nunits:  thev are  inadequate  for  habihtatjon  and  active  treatment.\n131,  The  iiMHE and  activity  space a! these  institutions  is dehumanizing.  The  facihivs\"\nphysical  layout  encourages  passivity  and  dependence  rather  than  activity  and  growth.  The\nenvironments  are  bare,  uncarpeted,  devoid  of  warmth,  individuality,  or  dignity.  Living  and\nsleeping  areas are  sparsely  furnished  and do not contain  age appropriate  furnishings  associated\nwith normal active iiving.  Plaintiffs are denied the developmental opportunities, the sensory and\nintellectual stimulation,  the comfort  and pleasure that community  residents obtain from  the usual\nsurroundings  ami  conveniences  in  homes,  schools,  restaurants,  work  places  and  recreational\nrdCiiilios.\n132- At best,  staff at the developmental centers provide bare custodial care.  More  often,\n:!iev  tail  to provide  (lie attention  nccessarv  to safeguard  residents  from  deterioration,  atrophy,\nphysical  injury  and  abuse.\nLack  of  Adequate  Basic  Cure\n133-  Plaintiffs'  basic  care  needs  are  ignored;  they  are  left  alone  for  hours.  Clover\nBottom  residents  m diapers  are  often  wet,  their  clothes  soaked  through  with  urine.  In  some\nunits,  the smell  of  urine  is pervasive.\n135,  In  many  units  at  Clover  Bottom  and  Greene  Valley  staff  ratios  are  inadequate  to\nmeet  residents'  basic  care  needs.  Despite  the  inadequate  staffing,  the  staff  who  are  on  duty\ncommonlv  ignore  their clients and  leave the residents  unattended.\n134. Because of staff shortages, staff often  \"float\"  to areas of the institution  to which they\n36\n\nare  not tvpicallv  assigned  and care  ;er a large  numner  or' residents  -A lion;  11io\\ uo no: know. Tr.:s\npractice  creates  an  unacceptablv  iiigli  r:sk o;  narin.\nI3!i.  Direct  care  statl  at  all  three  dc\\ciopmental  centers  lack  the  skills  h>  nnv. uie\nadequate  basic  care  to class  members  wiih  complex  disabilities  and serious  health  needs.\nLack  of Adequate  Medical  Care\n136.  Many  class  members do not  receive adequate  and  timely  medical  care  or  denial\ncare.  Their health  problems often  go unrecognized  and  untreated.\n137.  Medical staffing  at all three defendant developmental centers is grossly  inadequate\nto provide medical care thai is consistent  with professional  standards,\n138.  Further, medical personnel have inadequate experience and training. They are hired\nwithout  significant  experience  caring  for  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  and  have\nvirtually no in-service training or continuing education alter they begin.\n139.  The number of adequately  trained  nurses at Clover  Bottom and Greene  Valley is\ninsufficient  to meet residents'  health care needs.\n140.  Because of the lack of trained and experienced  medical staff,  residents at all three\ninstituions  receive  grossly  inadequate  preventive  and  ongoing  care.  Instead,  medical  care  is\ncharacterized by \"crisis management.\" The result is that class members suffer unnecessary pain,\nfractures,  injuries,  aspiration,  pneumonia,  decubitus ulcers and  swallowing dysfunction  which\nin turn inevitably cause decline in health status and, in many cases, a direct threat to life. These\nproblems could be avoided with adequate medical management plans to treat residents' ongoing\nhealth care needs.\n141.  Seizure  management  is  deficient.  Many  Clover  Bottom  residents  with  seizure\n\ndisorders  have  not  been  seen  by  a  neurologist  for  years.  Some  resales  coiuiiuic  ;o  re^:.i.\nanticonvulsant  medications  long  alter  tliev  have  stopped  having  seizures,  while  others  receive\ngrossly  subtherapeutic  doses  of  the  aniiconvulsanl  medications  thev  need.  The  incnnsiMOn'\nrecording  of  seizures  by  staff  seriously  compromises  the  rationale  for.  and  the  efficacy  ol\\\nprescribed  medications and  treatment.\n142.  In  a  representative  case,  a 44-year  old  woman  died  in  October.  1993  at  Clover\nBottom  as  a  result  of  aspiration  during  a  prolonged  seizure.  Lab  tests  repeatedly  showed\nsubstantially therapeutic levels of anti-seizure medication in her blood although her seizures were\nincreasing.  Despite  numerous  seizures,  including  one  lasting  ten  minutes  and  described  as\nuncontrolled,  this  woman's  physician  failed  to  pursue  therapeutic  levels  of  anti-seizure\nmedication.\n143.  Emergency  medical  care is inadequate.  The institutions  have no written  guidelines\nprescribing  when 91 1 should be called.  Residents who need immediate emergency  medical  care\nare transported  from  their living units to the medical building by non-medical  personnel  such as\nsecurity  officers  when  they  should  be  taken  by  emergency  medical  technicians  direct!v  to the\nhospital,\n144.  Quality  control,  peer  review  and  coordination  of  medical  care  are  virtually  non-\nexistent at all three institutions.  Medical  recordkeeping  and data collection  also are  inadequate.\nIndividual  medical records are in disarray:  Important  information  is missing, progress notes and\nplans are cursory, documents are misfiled  and physician  notes are illegible. Data concerning  the\nchronic medical  needs of residents is lacking. This absence of organized  information  is a serious\nimpediment  to  the  ability  of  staff  to  meet  the  critical  health  care  needs  of  the  residents.  The\n38\n\ndisorganization  of  medical  care  means  •iuu  planning  UK  n-anaenig  Uic  care  <:\\ ;V-M':O  ;.\\K;-\nchronic  medical  conditions  is practically  impossible.\n145.  Psychiatric  services are serioush  deficient  at all  three developmental  centers.  The\npsychiatric  consultation  currently  available  to the  institution  by  psychiatrists  under  contract  is\ncompletely  inadequate to supervise and  monitor the care of residents who arc receiving  psycho-\nactive  medications.  Failure  adequately  to  monitor  the  effects  of  medications  is dangerous  to\nresidents.  It greatly  enhances  the risk  that psycho-active  medications  may  be used  as  chemical\nrestraints.\n146.  Staff  members  often  present  conflicting  data  about  residents  to  the  psychiatrist\nwhich,  in turn,  may  lead  to inappropriate  prescription  of psycho-active  medications.\n147.  No  formal  process  exists  for  approval  of  medications  that  may  be  used  ior\nbehavioral  control. The institutions'  procedures for  tracking  medication  side-effects  is similarly\ndeficient.  This absence compounds the risk of harmful  side-effects  and jeopardizes the rights and\nliberty  of  class  members  who  are  unnecessarily  medicated.  For  example,  119  of  the  150\nresidents of  the Nat T.  Wilson  Developmental  Center  at the time of the  Department  of  Justice\ntour m earlv  1995 were on neuroleptic  medications for behavior control and there is no evidence\nthat  the staff  is attempting  to integrate  behavioral  and  psychopharmacological  treatments.\n148.The  significant  lapses  in  the  medical  services  being  provided  to  residents  are\nunacceptable.  They  compromise  plaintiffs'  long-range  outlook  and  create  an  undue  risk  of\nphysical  harm  and  loss of  lite.\nFrequent  Injury  and  Abuse\n151. Safetv conditions at all three developmental centers are seriously deficient.  The rate\n39\n\nof  injury  is alarming!v  high.  Main  o:  ::;;,- ;'iijru->  are  m  \\i\\\\'~_:u<x\\\\\\  ,L\\.V,'  arc  we:-..\" ;;:;.vi^:-,^\na* the  time  thev  occurred.\n149.  In  congregate  care  settings  such  as  these  developmenta:  centers.  redden;-  ui:k\nnialadaptive  behavior  will  hurt  other  residents,  ilns  risk  is  severe  at  all  tiiree  institutions  in\nTennessee,  where  residents  suiter  injuries  and  assaults  on  a regular  basis and  arc at serious  risk\nof  harm  in  their  own  living  units  and  throughout  the  institutions,  tor  instance,  at  the  Greene\nVallev  Developmental  Center over  1'3  ot  Hie injuries  reported  in incidence  reports  resulted  from\nresidents'  behaviors,  including  self-injury  and  aggression.\n150.  Reasonable  professional  attempts  to prevent  injury  are not  made  ai anv  of  the  three\ndevelopmental  centers.  Staff  fail  to  intervene  when  residents  injure  themselves  or  others.\nResidents  push,  hit and  bite one another,  oilen  causing  injury  serious  enough  to require  stitches\nor  loss  of  teeth,  in  plain  view  of  stall  vet  without  stall  intervention.\n151.  Two  representative  cases  involve  residents  of  the  Nat  T.  Wilson  Developmental\nCenter.  One  individual  was  injured  25 times  in an eight  month  period,  receiving  11  lacerations,\nincluding  one  that  was  six  inches  m  length.  The  other  individual  was  also  injured  25  times  in\nan  eight  month  period.  Sixteen  ot  those  injuries  were  self-inflicted  and  the  remainder  resulted\nfrom  fights  with  other  resident.  In  a  another  representative  case  at  the  Greene  Vallev\nDevelopmental  Center  an  1 1 year  old  bov  lost  his  sight  in one eve due  to repeated  heacislapping\nwhich  resulted  in a detached  retina.\n152.  Lack  of trained  staff,  nonimplementation  of programs  and  the almost  complete  lack\nof  activity  or  stimulation  in  the  units  contribute  significant!v  to  the  high  rate  of  injury.\n153.  These  institutions  cio not  conduct  the  analysis  needed  to  prevent  re-occurrence  of\n40\n\navoidable  injuries.  Without  adequate  rcponii-g  u:  tiara on  causes  miu  paiier;;:, o;  inuine-.  •'\nimpossible  to know  How to prevent  them.\n154.  Defendants  have .tailed  to protect  resident1; ot  the  institutions  trom  physical  abuse\nand  neglect -\n155.Verbal  abuse  is widespread.  Staff  at  Clover  Bottom  use abrupt,  verbal  commands\nto communicate  with  residents;  often,  tiiev  scream  at  them.\n156. Staff  are not encouraged  to report abuse or neglect:  some staff  use intimidation  to\nprevent other staff  from  reporting  such incidents.  Out of a sample of ten residents at the Greene\nValley  Developmental  Center,  the Department  of Justice investigation  revealed  that  60% of the\nresidents  had  injuries  for  which  no report  could  be  located.\n157.  Abuse  investigations are cursory,  and  many  potential  incidents of abuse are  never\ninvestigated.  Those  investigations  that are carried  out ivpically  conclude with a finding  that the\nallegation is not substantiated, even in cases in which the evidence suggests that abuse did occur,\n158.  Neglect of  residents is common.  Residents are left  for extended  periods of time in\nsoiled  clothes or engaging  in self-injurious  behavior  unattended.\n159.  Numerous environmental  health and  fire safety  deficiencies  were  found  at Nat.  T.\nWinston which greatlv increase the risk of injury  to class members.  The kitchen area was  found\nto  be  unsanitary  and  in  poor  repair,  subjecting  residents  to  high  risks  of  food  and  water\ncontamination.  Fire  evacuation  plans  were  also  found  to  be  in  need  of  revision  and\ntbrmalization.\nDenial of Minimally  Adequate Habilitation and  Training\n160. Habilitation is the teaching and training process required by persons with significant\n41\n\ndisabilities  so that  rhev can  reach  their  fuliesi  pnientiai  in  phv^cai,  .sociai  and  menu-;  cruwMc\n164,  Virtual!v  all  persons  with  significant  disabilities  have  the  capabilitv.  with  proper\neducation  and training,  to learn  some basic sell-care  skills:  to participate  in feeding,  ioi ietinrz.\nmobility  and  other  bodily  needs.  Nearly  ail  the  residents  ot  the  state  developmental  centers\ncould, with reasonable,  individualized instruction and adaptations, participate more in their self-\nhelp  functioning.\n161.  Active treatment  is the  formal  process of training,  treatment  and care that  must be\ndelivered  to each  Medicaid-eligible  resident  of  an  Intermediate  Care  Facility  for  the  Mentally\nRetarded (ICF/MR). Active treatment is a professionally  designed, consistently and aggressively\nimplemented  program of training, treatment,  and other services to enable each ICF/MR  resident\nto  function  with  the  greatest  self-determination  and  independence  possible.  42  U.S.C.  §\n1396did); 42 C.F.R.  § 483.440.\n162. Active treatment  requires the development and implementation  of an  individualized\nprogram  of  intervention  that  is based  upon  and  accountable  to a comprehensive  assessment  of\nthe individual needs of the resident and an individual program plan (IPP). Assigning an  ICF/MR\nresident to a generic activity (one that is generally  available at a facility)  is not active  treatment\nunless the activity fulfills  an individual goal or objective that, in turn, addresses an assessed need\nof  the individual  resident.  42  C.F.R.  § 483.440(a),  (c}(3). (c)(4),  (d)(3).\n163.  No  long-term  view  leading  to greater  independence,  productivity  and  integration\nguides the program  planning  process  for  residents of the three developmental  centers.\n164.  Individual  program  plans  are  meaningless  as  a  guide  to  habilitation.  They\nfrequently  ignore  the  residents'  individual  needs,  even  when  those  needs  are  obvious  and\n42\n\n166.  Individual  program  plans at Clover  Bottom  fail  to identify  the mechanical  supports\nneeded  to achieve proper  bodv  position,  balance  or alignment,  as well  as the reasons  for  each\nsupport  and  the situation  in which  each  is to lie applied.\n167.  Individual  program  plans  at  Clover  Bottom  tail  to  include  opportunities  tor\nindividual  choice  and  self-management.  Class  members  are  not  offered  reasonable  treatment\nchoices and alternatives.  Individual  program  plans do not reflect  the  input of the class  member\nor  his  family.\n168.  Goals  are  \"canned.\"  not  individualized  at all  three developmental  centers.  Plans\naticl programs  for  residents  with  different  levels of ability  are virtually  identical.\n169.  Plans and  programs  are  not  revised  and  updated  in  light of  the person's  changing\nneeds  but  remain  unchanged  from  one year to the  next.\n170.  The  number  of  professional  staff  who  work  at  these  developmental  centers  is\ninadequate.\n171.  The professional  staff  who arc employed  at the centers do not adequately  monitor\nthe delivery  of  the programs  they develop  tor class members.  There  is no effective  method  to\nensure  quality  and  consistency  of performance  among  direct  care  staff.\n172.  Direct  care  staff  at Clover  Bottom  have little  knowledge of the persons  for  whom\nthev  arc  assumed  to care.  Often,  they  cannol  even  identify  the  persons  lor  whom  they  have\n43\n\ncaresiving  responsibiiitv and finis arc rompietc:\\  unaware ot the Mpn: -cant ;>>ue_! in [\\\\-J'T  \\\\\\\\:>.\n173.  Direct  care  staff  are  not  adequately  trained  ;u  carry  out  meir  clients'  individual\nprogram  plans and often  do nor even  know  liie content  ot  tiiose  plans.  \"1 he\\  do not  understand\ntheir clients'  needs nor the techniques  required  to teach  them  functional  skills, Thev do not know\nhow  to collect  meaningful  progress  data.\n174.  Accurate and  meaningful  data are not kept on anv developmental  center  residents\nthat can show progress, regression or lack of change.\n175.  All  three  developmental  centers  lack  the  capability  to  deliver  active  treatment\nbecause  the  basic  components  of  active  treatment-adequate  professional  staff,  functioning\ninterdisciplinary  teams,  adequate  assessments,  professionally-designed  individual  habilitation\nplans, and direct care staff trained and supervised  in the deliverv of each resident's plan—do not\nexist.\n176. Staff  fail  to implement  active treatment  programs  for class members,  especially to\nthe  those  whose disabilities  are severe.  Class  members  spend  only  a fraction  of their  time in\nprogram-related  activities.\n177.  Untrained,  unsupervised,  unfamiliar  with  their  clients'  needs  and  abilities  and\nunaware  of what  is expected  of them,  staff  stand  idle  in a roomful  of their  clients  -- or  they\nsocialize  with one another and ignore  their clients.\n178.  Residents  receive little attention  from  staff, and rarely  interact  with  anyone  other\nthan  a paid  staff  member.  Most of tiieir time is \"dead  time.\"  They  spent  long periods of time\n\"waitina\"  to so from  one activity to another,  self-stimulating,  rocking,  milling around,  dozing,\nor  simply  doing  nothing.\n44\n\n1 /9. The inleruiSCiphnarv  teams lor each  pcrso:; do not  have a sufficient  ,-Tas  ;•:' ser  ^e-\navailable  to  make  reasonable  habilitanon  ciecisinn^  lor  meeting  she  needs  of  Hie  indnKiuai.\n18U.Training  programs  at  all  three  developmental  censers  depart  substaniia'ik  :>(>:;:\nprofessional  judgment,  standards  and  practice.  They  are  inappropriate  io the  learning  need-  o\\\npersons  with  severe  intellectual  disabilities.\n181.  Training  programs  do  not  teacii  functional  skills.  Residents  are  denied  the\nopportunity  to learn  the skills of daily  living,  such as dressing  and  tooth-brushing.  In the  living\nunits,  there  are  no  materials  that  can  be  used  to  teach  age-appropriate,  functional  skills.\n182.  Many  residents  are  capable  of  going  to  the  store,  choosing  and  purchasing  their\nfood,  cooking  and  serving  meals  and  caring  for  their  own  living  units,  but  they  have  no\nopportunity  to do  so.  Staff  cook  and  clean  while  the  residents  remain  idle.\n183.  Residents  are not  provided  with  adequate  individualized  adaptations  to enable  them\nso do things  for  themselves.  Adaptive equipment  is not generally available  to residents who  need\nit  in  their  education  and  living  areas.\n184.  Communication  and  cooperation  between  cottage  and  school  or  adult  education\nprograms  is virtually  non-existent.\n185.  Residents'  opportunities  to  interact  with  non-disabled  persons  and  to  spend  time\noutside  the  institution  are  extremely  limited.  Residents  of  the  institutions  receive  little  or  no\ncommunity-based  instruction;  that  is.  they  have  little  or  no opportunity  to  learn  skills  that  will\nenable  them  to  function  in  their  communities,  such  as  acting  and  dressing  appropriately  in\npublic,  eating  in  a restaurant,  going  to a  movie,  crossing  streets.\n186.  Few  recreational  or  leisure  time  activities  are  available  to  plamtilis.  Thev  spend\n45\n\nlittle time outdoors  and  have lit\n187.  Habitation  does\nintegration.  The  quality  of  life  of  persons  a: these centers  is unacceptable  because  it oilers  no\nopportunity  for progress,  participation  m vaiued  hie activities, daily life style choices,  privacy,\nsafety,  dignity  and  hope  for  improvement.\n188.  Many  of  the  school  aged  children  living  at  the  three  developmental  centers  are\ndenied  the opportunity  to be educated  with, children who do not have disabilities.  Although  then-\neducational  needs  could  be  met  in  regular  public  schools  and  classes,  maiiv  of  these  children\nmust attend  \"school\"  on campus  simply  because they  live in state  institutions,\n189.  The  Individualized  Education  Programs  (IEPss  lor  school-age  children  are\ninadequate and do not assure the provision  of a free appropriate  public education  to winch  these\nstudents are entitled.  IEP goals and objectives are extremely  limited—for example,  it is common\nto  find  only  two skills addressed  in a  student's  IEP  over  a three-year  period.  Students  do  not\nreceive  the related  services  such  as physical  therapy  to which  they are entitled  as part  of  their\neducation  due to the absence  of  interaction  between  therapy  staff  and educational  staff.\n190. The consequences of defendants'  failure  to provide active treatment at  institutions,\nor to implement professional  recommendations  for placement elsewhere, are devastating to class\nmembers. Their basic needs are neglected, their time is wasted, their bodies are constricted,  they\ndevelop behavior problems. They  lose basic skills such as the ability to speak and to walk.  They\nare  deprived  of  the opportunity  to live  in  a decent  home  and  to build  relationships  with  non-\ndisabled  people.  Their  human  potential  is  wasted.\nFailure  to  Provide  Adequate  Behavior  Management\n46\n\n141.  Behavior  management  is  ,u:  imporan-  -  m:^:;-:  :  ^f  ;;,;;—  a-H-  aaa  ;_-.;.;•\n•'  j'  _v'  H  •,' ..  L\"  „  -  -\nbehavioral  problems  are  seriously  deficient.  A:- a resuh.  ph\\ sicai  and  chemical  restraints  roe\nutilized  as a  substitute  for  appropriate  care  and  programs:  residents'  nehaviora!  problems  a:o\naggravated  and  escalate.\n192.  Residents  do  not  have  the  environmental  and  phvsical  supports  to  develop  and\nmaintain  positive  behaviors.  Without  those  supports,  behavior  management  techniques  are\nineffective  and  reduced  to crisis  intervention  alter  harm  and  iniurv  have already  occurred.\n193.  The  developmental  centers  do  not  properly  conduct  the  assessments  needed  io\ndevelop  effective  programs  of  behavioral  support.  Few  if  anv  functional  behavioral  analyses,\nwhich are the foundation  tor developing adequate behavior intervention strategies, are conducted.\n194.  Programs  are not  individualized  lor each  resident.  Programs  for  different  persons\narc virtually  identical.  The  programs  are incomplete,  incoherent,  and  are  not  implemented.  In\na representative case, an older male resident of the Greene Valley  Development Center who had\na history of pica (eating  forei.cn obiects) documented  in his record back to  i977 had no program\nto correct  this  behavior.\n195.  Documentation  of  residents'  behavior  is  inaccurate,  unreliable,  inconsistent  and\nincomplete. Data collected on residents' behavioral and skill training programs are identical  from\nday to uav,  sivina  the appearance that data is fabricated  or recorded at the end of the day,  week\nor  month.  The  meaningless  quality  of  the  data  deprives  professional  staff  of  the  information\nnecessary  to make  professional,  appropriate  and  safe  decisions  regarding  training.\n196.  Staff  do  not  ha\\e  the  skills  and  competence  necessary  to  implement  behavioral\n\ninterventions  to manage  inappropriate  neha>;i>r ur to implement  individual  program  pian^.  Nu:--\nintervention  to  manasze  inappropriate  behavior  has  no  treatment  or  iong  term  efleet.\n197,  In place of adequate behavioral  support,  staff  practice emergency  physical  restraint\nThis  is an  inherently  riskv  procedure  that  placed  residents  as  serious  risk  of  injury  and  death,\n198  Staff  are  unfamiliar  with  the  behavior  programs  vi~ the  residents  thev  supervise.\n199.  The  inability  of  the  staff  lo  deal  with  continual  behavior  problems  results  in  more\nfrequent  accidents  and  injuries  to class  members.  For  instance,  a resident  of the  Nat  T.  Wilson\nDevelopment  Center  suffered  a dislocated  elbow  after  a take-down  procedure.\n200.  The  behavior  management  practices  are  inadequate  to  prevent  or  reduce  the\nincidence  of  abuse  and  injury  to class  members,  or  to ensure  freedom  from  undue  restraint.\nFailure to Provide  Adequate  Physical  Therapy and Physical  Management\n201.  Manv  residents  who  have  contractures  or  are  non-ambulatory  require  physical\ntherapy  and  frequent  positioning  and  repositioning  in  order  to  prevent  skin  breakdown  and\nmuscle and joint  deterioration.\n202.  Physical  therapy  services  at  Clover  Bottom  and  Greene  Valley  are  seriously\ndeficient.  Direct care and professional  staff  are untrained  in how to properly  position,  transfer\nor  move  residents.  Programs  are  not  effectively  implemented.  Physical  therapy  staff  is\ninsufficient  to meet residents* needs.  For instance, there is only one physical therapist on staff\nat Greene Valley Developmental  Center tor a population of over 400 residents.\n203.  Class  members  are  not  positioned  properly  tor  sitting,  eating  or other  activities\nrequiring proper body alignment or support. The few staff actually engaged in physical therapy\nactivities engage in many dangerous practices such as lifting  or moving residents by grabbing\n48\n\nand pulling on their arms or legs,  which  casik  can  resuh  in broken  bones.  Staff  Jan :o take :.-,e\nmost basic precautions such as kicking  wheelchairs before  transterring  residents in or our ,v  me\nchair.\n204. Developmental  Center staff place residents with physical disabilities in inappropriate\npositions or allow them to remain  in devices or postures that inhibit  their ability to function  and\nmay even  exacerbate  their  deformities.\n205.  Therapeutic  equipment  helps to hold  a developmental!}' disabled  person's  body  in\nalignment,  prevent  the progression  of deformity  and  allow  the  person  to move as normally  as\nshe can.  With proper individualized  therapeutic equipment,  persons with  severe  developmental\ndisability,  severe physical  disabilities and deformities  and  severe and  profound  retardation  can\nachieve better alignment,  better control of their muscles and limbs, and more normal and  varied\nmovements.  They can  learn  to sit in more upright positions that  facilitate  growth and  learning.\n210.  Adequate  therapeutic  equipment  is  lacking.  Residents  with  severe  physical\ndisabilities and deformities  use ill-fitting  wheelchairs  that do not provide adequate  support  and\ntherefore  cause progression  of the person's deformity  and increase the risk of accidental  injurv.\nThe  deficiencies  are  so  severe  as  to  represent  an  active  threat  to  class  members'  health  and\nsafety.\n206.  Accurate  documentation  of  residents'  individual  physical  therapy  status  does  not\nexist.  This  makes  it  impossible  to  determine  whether  any  intervention  has  been  effective  or\nineffective  and whether modifications  need to be made in residents'  services.  As a result,  many\nresidents are continued  for  years on  the same  programs despite lack of  progress.\n207.  The  developmental  centers  do  not  provide  adequate  assistive  devices  to  enable\n49\n\nresidents  to  walk  and  move.  Pui;:;;:;:-  «:;(•  conic,  waik  ^ui  move  urn  .m:>ac:,e  .ov\nunreasonably  pres erileci  from  doing  so and  io--e me  abiii'v  10 walk  altogether.\n-'08.  As a result ot  improper ptisitum;nL: and lack o! adequate phvsicai therapy,  re^ide-v-'\ndeformities actually have increased, 'i'iiey have developed  scoiiosis, windswept deformities,  froLi-\nleg deformities  and  contracturcs  that preclude  the ability  to sit upright.  As a result of  improper\npositioning and  lack of adequate physical  therapy.  Clover Bottom  residents  who once sat  upright\nin  wheelchairs  are confined  to beds  and  cans.\n209.  Lack  o(  proper positioning  and  therapy  has also led  to osteoporosis,  kidney  stones,\ndigestive  difficulties,  circulatory  problems,  respiratory  problems,  and  deterioration  of  normal\nfunction,  growth,  and  sensorv  ant! cognitive  abilities.\nFailure  to  Provide  Adequate  Nutritional  Management\n210.  Staff  a! (Mover  Bottom  and  Greene  Valley  are  not trained  properly  to teed  persons\nwith  severe disabilities.  As a result,  'lies  tail  to properly  position  residents during  meals,  utilize\nappropriate  feeding  techniques,  and  effectively  monitor  residents  at  meal  time.  Because  of\nimproper  feeding  techniques,  residents  face  the  serious,  life-threatening  risks  of  aspiration,\nchoking  and  reflux.\n211.  Class  members  who  need  individual  mealtime  programs  to instruct  staff  in  how  to\njeed  them  safely  do  not  have  them.\n212.  Class  members  who  have  regressed  in  their  ability  to  chew  and  swallow  are  not\nprovided  oral-motor  intervention  to  maintain  those  abilities.  Together  with  improper  feeding\ntechniques,  this compounds  the  risk  of  weight  loss,  dehydration,  aspiration,  and  intection.\n213.  From  being  ranidlv  fed  pureed  food  some  plaintiffs  have altogether  lost the  ability\n\n_  -  ipronnateh  idennfv  and treat  class\nmembers  with  potentially  fatal  nuintional  dysfunctions  such  as  unhealthv  weight  loss,  caliri:\ndisorders,  dvspiiagia  or  reflux.\nFailure to  Provide  Adequate  Occupational  Therapy\n215.  Occupational  therapy  is  a  component  of  habtiitation  and  active  treatment.\nOccupational  therapists  assist  people  with  disabilities  to  master  the  functional  activities  of\neveryday  living and  meet  the demands  of their  environment.\n216.  Because  occupational  therapy  is  environmentally  and  contextual!}'  bound,  the\nlimitations  of  the  environment  at  developmental  centers  limits  the  ability  of  occupational\ntherapists  to  train  or  teach.  Occupational  therapists cannot  adequately  teach  community  living\nskills at all  three  institutions because  the environments  are completely  unlike  the  community.\nFailure to Provide  Adequate  Language and Communication  Services\n21\".  Communication  services are an important part of habilitation and active treatment.\nIf people with severe developmental  disabilities are not provided  with adequate intervention  to\naddress their speech and language needs, they will regress,\n218.  Little speech and language training is conducted at the developmental centers.  As\na result,  residents do not receive the instruction and therapy  thev need to improve or maintain\ntheir ability to understand others and communicate their needs. Augmentative devices to enable\nresidents to communicate are virtually non-existent or are not in use. Staff  make no attempt to\ncommunicate  with  residents  in  sign  language,  although  manv  residents  could  benefit  from\nlearninii  sisns.\n5!\n\n219.  Delenciants  have  Sailed  to  pro\\ iue  class  members  ^iU;  a^isine  VLniH'^^o\nfacilitated  communication  and  other  methods  through  V.Inch  many  persons  previously  k-belcLi\nseverely  and  profoundly  retarded  have  learned  to communicate  and  express  ideas.  In  this, and\nin  their  pervasive  denial  of  liabiiitntion  and  learning  to  class  members,  defendants  have\ndiminished  and  failed  to protect the capacity of class members to produce ideas by ilnnkiim and\nlearning,  and  to express those  ideas through  communication.\nFailure to Provide  Adequate  Vocational  Training  and  Opportunities  for  Employment\n220.  People with severe intellectual  disabilities and challenging behavior can  participate\nin productive  work  and  work  at real jobs  in  real  workplaces.\n221.  With  individualized  systematic  instruction  and  practice,  the  majority  of  these\nresidents  have the capability  to learn  and  maintain  vocational  skills.\n222. The opportunity  to use and  practice vocational  skills in real  work settings  provides\npersons with severe disabilities not only with the benefits of earning wages and decreasing  their\ndependence on public  support,  but also provides the benefits  of participating  in the  community\nin a valued  role—worker—and  developing  relationships with co-workers,  friends  and other non-\ndisabled  people  who are  not  paid  to be with  them.  Opportunities  to work  in  real  job  settings\nallows tor modeling and learning appropriate work habits and social behaviors lrom  non-disabled\npeers—something  that is not possible at the state developmental  centers.\n223. There  lias never been a systematic attempt to develop true vocational  programs  ibr\ndevelopmental  center  residents.  The  programs  called  \"vocational\"  are  not  truly  vocational\nbecause  they do not  lead  to jobs,  nor do they  teach  skills that can  prepare people  ibr  jobs.\nViolation  of  Class  Members'  Basic  Rights  to  Persona!  Choice,  Dignity,  Privacy.\nCommunication. Access to Persona! Property, Freedom of Association and Participation in\n52\n\nCommunity  Activities\n224. Residents are deprived of dignity.  .Staff interact wall them cither as children or AS\nobjects to be managed.  Staff are allowed to treat residents with indifference,  and to abuse them\nwithout consequence.\n225. Residents are denied privacy because of the sheer numbers of residents and the lack\nof adequate staff  to assist residents with  intimate bodily  functions  in private.\n226. Class members are routinely denied  the basic rights of freedom  of association and\ncommunication,  access to personal  property, and participation  in community activities.\n227.  Residents  are denied  the  right  to marry  or  to enjoy  intimate  relationships.  The\npolicy  and  practice  at  the  institutions  is  to  separate  residents  who  wish  to engage  in  sexual\nactivity.\n228.  The developmental  centers  fail  to monitor  the  residents'  personal  property  or to\nprotect it from  theft.\n229.  Class  members  are  denied  an  adequate  opportunity  to participate  in  community\nactivities.  Some  never  leave  the  institution  at  all.  During  the  entire  summer  of  1994.  for\nexample,  191 Clover  Bottom  residents did  not go off-grounds  for  community  or  recreational\noutings.\n230.  Class  members  are  denied  the right  to attend  religious  services  in  the  faith  and\ncongregation  of their choice. Most class members do not have the choice of attending  services\noff  campus because they are not provided with transportation  to do so. In this, class members\nare  denied  their  right  to  freely  exercise  their  respective  religious  beliefs  since  the  services\noffered  at  the  institutions  do  not  and  cannot  reflect  the  variety  of  class  members'  religious\n\nprelerences-\n231.  Residents  spend  near!}  a ii their  time  m  the::  iisinc.  .:u;:s  ;ui;:  r-ir^-i\\.  it  c--e\", cv\nallowed  to  recreate  out  of  doors.\n232.  Residents  experience  acute  social  isolation.  The  living,  learning  ami  working\nenvironments  of  the  vast  majority  ol  residents  arc completely  segregated  from  the  comnum;t\\.\nThey  have  little or  no opportunity  to acquire  and  practice  life  skills  in  typical  settings,  such  as\nhome,  school  or  job  site.  They  have  little or  no  opportunity  to  make  nondisabled  friends  who\narc  not  paid  stall.\n233.  Class  members  arc denied  the right  to make  the basic  choices  about  their  lives  that\nother  citizens  take  for  grantee!.  They  have  no  opporlunilv  to  learn  to  make  decisions  for\nthemselves.\n234.  The  developmental  centers  have  denied  plaintiffs  their  riiiht  io  freedom  (if\nassociation  and  expression  In  restricting  their  access  to  community  activities,  friendships  and\nvisitation.  Plaintiffs  are  denied  the  opportunity  to  leave  the  facility  to  participate  in  outside\n235.  The  size,  scale,  isolation  and  segregation  of  the  developmental  centers  presents\nalmost  insurmountable  impediments  to  the  exercise  of  basic  rights.  Residents  are  assigned  to\njaree  trrouns  within  the  institutions  because  ot  the  logistical  needs  ol  the  taciliites  and  cannot\nchoose  whom  to  associate  with.  The  \"group\"  approach  to  life  precludes  choice  for  most\nresidents,\nUnnecessary  Restraint\n236.  In the absence ol adequate programming  to teach  positive behavior,  residents are\n54\n\nsubjected  LO unnecessary  restraint.\n237.  Medication  for control  of behavior  is used outside or and no; in coniuuaion  \\u!h\n(tie individual  program  plan in violation  of ICF. MR standards.\n238.  Residents are often  physically restrained when the demands of individual  residents\nbecome inconvenient  tor staff.\nFailure to Provide Adequate Discharge  Planning\n239.  Post-discharge  planning  and  follow-along  services  are  inadequate.  Residents  are\ndischarged from the institution without adequate effort to assure that they will receive the proper\nsupport in an alternative setting. As a result, residents who have been discharged are at risk of\nharm and of  readmission.\n240.  in  the past  vcar,  through  the  Middle Tennessee  Office  of  Community  Services,\nClover Bottom has discharged  73 residents, often  without proper planning and provision of the\nservices  needed  to  meet  the  person's  needs.  Of  the  73,  62  were  discharged  to  community\nagencies or homes. Defendants themselves acknowledge that at least  16 of these persons are not\ndoing well in their present placement.\n241.  Defendants also discharged  1 1 Clover Bottom residents to general nursing  facilities\nduring the last year.  Nursing facilities are considered by professionals and federal  regulators to\nbe a totally  inappropriate setting for persons with developmental  disabilities since they do not\nprovide the active treatment or services needed by persons with those disabilities. The  staffing\nrauo in a typical nursing facility  falls far short of the staffing  needed to provide adequate care\nto persons with significant  developmental  disabilities.\n242.  Five of the eleven persons placed from  Clover Bottom  into nursing facilities in the\n\niast  year  have  died,  some  within  a  tew  weeks  or  day-  o\\  placement.  One  u;ec  of  ;<;;»,;•.\nobstruction,  another  of  gastro-intestinal  bleeding,  and  another  of  a  bacterial  iniectiori.\n243.  Approximately  60  residents  have  been  discharged  over  the  past  year  from  Na;  T.\nWinston.  99  residents  have  been  discharged  from  Greene  Vallev  in  the  past  fiscal  vear  and  of\nthose  five  have  returned.\nRegression\n244. As a result of the conditions set forth  in paragraphs  128-243 above, residents have\nregressed at all three developmental centers.  Their limbs are twisted and deformed,  their bodies\nare bent and contorted,  their bones have decalcified.  Class members who could walk without\nsupport now need staff assistance, while others are confined in wheelchairs. Residents who could\nsit up now lie in carts.\n245.  Class  members who were in good  health  now have serious, even  life--threatening\nhealth problems, including damaged lungs and difficulties  with breathing and digestion.  Class\nmembers who could eat orally now are  tube-fed.\n246. From the numbing effect of idleness and the institutions\" barren environment, class\nmembers  have  lost  cognitive  skills,  the  ability  to  relate  to  others  and  to  respond  to  their\nenvironment.  Class  members  have  lost  the  ability  to  speak  and  communicate.  From  being\ndenied the opportunity  to engage in the activities of daily living, class members have lost those\nskills altogether.\nThe Inevitability  of the Harms\nExperienced bv Plaintiffs at the Developmental  Centers\n247.  Custodial  facilities  like the defendant  institutions  inherently  deny to plaintiffs  the\nexperiences,  interactions  and  opportunities  lor  growth  and  development  enjoyed  by  other\n56\n\nmembers  of  society.\n248.  Bv  segregating  persons  with  significant  iiisahdities  irom  the  rest  o;  me  :un;nur-!;\n;md  isolating  them  ai developmental  centers  with  others  who arc disabied.  defendants  emphasi/r\ntheir  \"difference\"  from  the  rest  of  socieu,  stigmatizing  them  lor  hie,\n249.  Persons  with  significant  disabilities,  like other  persons,  varv  in their  needs,  wishes\nl  abilities.  At different  points of  life,  different  activities  and  environments  are appropriate  to\nanc\neach  person.  The  environment  of  the  defendant  developmental  centers  is designed  for  a  single\nnuroose—for  custodial  care and  mass  management  of  persons  with  severe disabilities.  Plaintifts'\nconsignment  to  this  environment  deprives  them  of  their  individuality,  of  the  possibility  of\nhabilitation.  and  o(  living  freely.\n250.  In  an  environment  designed  for  mass  management  of  large  numbers  of  residents,\npersons  with  severe  disabilities  cannot  receive  the  consistent  individual  attention  they  need  to\ngrow,  develop and  avoid  regression.  Persons  who cannot  communicate  in words  need  attention\nfrom  others who know  them  well and  understand  their method  of communication.  Far more  than\nmose  who  can  speak  articulately  and  whose  disabilities  are  less  severe,  people  with  severe\ndisabilities and  those who cannot  speak need close personal attention  which  they can  receive only\nIn a  fainilv-scale  setting.\n251.  Persons  with  complex  needs  tare  the  least  well  in  large  congregate  settings.  The\nmore  complex  the person's  needs,  die smaller  the setting  must  be,  to enable  to staff  to  focus  on\nnnd  provide  consistent  attention  to  the  individual.\n252.  A  congregate  care  facility  is  not  a  natural  environment.  It  is  an  artificial\nenvironment  in  which  persons  with  intellectual  disabilities  cannot  learn  real  lire  skills  or\n\nlunctional  activities.  In  such  an  envnon;m>n<.  person;;  \\\\I:M do1, do^nenrn1  uisabinLicN  caniHn\nreceive what their specific  learning needs require:  the opportunity  to learn  reai-iife  skills in the\nenvironments  where  those skills are  practiced.\n25J.  Congregate  care  iacilities.  particular!v  uhcre  there  are  one  hundred  or  more\nresidents,  are  dangerous  because  ol  a  high  risk  thai  a  resident  will  lose  her  own  sense  of\npersonal  identity  and  the reinforcing  and  stimulating  aspects  of direct  handling  in a stable and\nfamily-like  atmosphere.\n254.  The  threat  of  abuse  of  persons  with  significant  disabilities  is  increased  in  an\ninstitutional  setting  to the extent  that  the institution  congregates a large number  of people  with\ndependent  needs.\n255.  Persons  with  challenging  behavior  need  as  \"models\"  persons  without  maladaptive\nbehavior.  When  persons with  challenging  behavior are congregated  together,  as they are at Hie\ndevelopmental  centers,  there  is  an  enhanced  risk  of  learning  maladaptive  behavior  from  the\nexample of the behavior  of others.\n256. The size and scale of the developmental  centers is an impediment  to the consistent,\neffective  delivery of therapeutic activities and services.  In a large setting, many more staff  must\nbe trained  in consumers\" therapy and  management  programs than would be the case in a smaller\nsetting.\n257.  The  maintenance  of employee  resolve and  standards  is much  more complicated  at\na congregate care  facility  than  it is in a small  program.  It is difficult  in a large  facility  to hold\nstaff accountable to deliver residents\" programs.  The complexity of the institutional  bureaucracy\nand the lack of staff accountability  in a large congregate environment  make it difficult  to get the\n58\n\nsimplest  thing  done.\n258.  It  is  tremendously  difficult  10  recruit  ciualified  professional  staff  to  uork  a:\ndevelopmental centers.  This is due not only to the Sow pay nut to the administrative barriers thai\nstaff  must overcome  lo work  efficiently  m that  environment.\n259.  Because so many persons with complex disabilities are congregated  together at the\ndevelopmental centers, their needs overwhelm the staff.  Congregating a large number ot person1;\nwith  complex  needs  greatly  increases  the  difficulty  for  staff  of  finding  activities  that  are\ninteresting, stimulating or meaningful  for the residents. Conversely, however, when persons with\nsignificant  disabilities  spend  time  with  persons  without  disabilities,  each  nondisabled  person\nserves as a natural  teacher,  and  opportunities  for  learning  are  multiplied.\n260. The opportunity  to share places with people who are not labelled  \"retarded\"  cannot\nbe afforded  to people  with  disabilities  in  institutions;  it can  only  be afforded  in  communities.\nThe  opportunities  and  benefits  of  being  around  other  people  who  do  not  have  disabilities\n(including  the  benefits  of  modeling  and  learning  personal  and  community  living  skills),  the\nopportunity  to  form  friendships  with  people who do not  have disabilities,  and  the  opportunity\nto gain  the respect  of  members of  the community  are not available  in  institutions.\n261.  No matter how  large the ratio of staff  to clients in a large congregate care  setting,\nsuch  a  facility  can  never  achieve  the  same  favorable  results  as a  normal  home  with  support.\nIncreasing  the ratio of staff  to clients will only  lead  to a point of diminishing  returns,  at which\none additional staff member will not result in any additional interaction  with the people who live\nthere.  However,  when  only one staff  person  works  with  a very  small  number of  residents,  the\nquality  of  staff  interaction  with  residents  improves  greatly.\n\nTI •  liu.  *.\nas a  Means  to  '';•>  \"•'  ,\n262. The state institu  > '  ..  -  OILS\nwith developmental  disabilities. The ''medical  model\" is a paradigm or  framework  tor  providing\nservices  to people  with  disabilities  that  was current  when  most  slate  institutions  were  built  but\nis now obsolete. That  model was based on the premise  that a person  wish a disability  should  be\nplaced  in a special  setting  whose purpose  is to \"treat\"  his disability  or deficit.  An aspect of  the\nmedical  model  is  the concept  of  the  \"continuum  of  care,\"  that  is.  a continuum  of  residential\nsettings  from  the  most  restrictive  to the  least  restrictive,  irom  the  most  heavily  started  to  the\nleast heavily  staffed.  According  to the  \"medical  model,\" a person  is expected  to move  through\nthe various stages of the continuum—from  a state institution to a nursing home or large  ICF/MR,\nto a small  ICF/MR.  to a group  home,  to a semi-independent  living arrangement  and  finally  to\na home of one's own—as he  \"improves\" and  meets the exit criteria  for each  setting.  According\nto  this  concepi,  people  can  move  from  a  restrictive  congregate  setting  such  as  one  of  the\ndefendant  institutions  only  by  demonstrating  their  \"readiness\"  for  the  next  level  of  the  con-\ntinuum.  In vocational  services,  the medical  model  dictates  that  the person  earn  his way  along\na similar  \"continuum  of care\":  from  a day activity center  to a work activity center to sheltered\nwork and  eventually  to a real  job only  as his skills  improve.\n263.  Research  and  experience  have shown  conclusively  that  the  medical  model  and  the\ncontinuum  of  care  are  unnecessary  and  highly  unsuccessful  in  preparing  persons  with\ndevelopmental  disabilities  to live and  work  in  more  integrated  and  normal  settings.\n264.  Research  and  experience  have  shown  that  institutions  are  not  needed  to  serve\npersons  with  developmental  disabilities,  including  persons  with  complex  needs  such  as\n60\n\nchallenging  behavioi  o;  scno!^  medical  p:^n!er^\"  ;n;u uvcro1:;^ ca^  ;;.f  m ;:ie ^on;;;n:r;;y;  ..• ,\nthai people with  developmental  disabiiitv  arc belter  of;  m integrated  communuv  j-eilings aaa-  a-\nlarge  congregate  settings  based  on  the  '\"deficit\"1  modeh\n265.  Other  states  have  reduced  their  admissions  to  state  institutions  io  zero.\ndemonstrating  conclusively  that  the  institutional  model  ami  the  continuum  o!  care  are\nunnecessary.  Oilier  states serve people  with disabilities as severe as those of the residents of any\nstate  institution  in  home  and  community-based  settings.  Still  other  states  have  concluded\nexplicitly  that  tliev  have  no  further  need  for  state  mental  retardation  institutions.  New\nHampshire,  Rhode  island  and  Vermont  have  closed  their  slate  institutions.  Other  states.\nincluding  Colorado,  Maine,  Michigan,  New  York and  Wyoming,  have explicit or  implicit  plans\nto close  all  their  state  institutions  within  the  next  five  years.\n266.  No sen. ices are provided at state developmental  centers that cannot  feasibly  be  made\navailable  to  class  members  in  the  community.  To  the  contrary,  critically-needed  services  such\nas  physical  therapy,  communication,  nutritional  management  and  behavior  management  are\nprovided  inadequately  and  sporadically  at state  institutions,  or  not  at all.  In the community,  the\nprofessional  services  class  members  need  are  widely  available.\n26-7.  In a familv-scaie  residence,  it is eas\\  for  staff  to become  familiar  with  [lie  persons\nneeds,  in  a way  that  staff  in  the  institution  cannot.\n2h8-  Defendants'  failure  to  make  residential  services  available  to  class  members  with\nserious  medical  needs  is  irrational  since  in  Tennessee  as  in  other  states  aii  over  the  country,\nchildren  with  complex  medical  needs-children  who  are  technology  dependent,  ventilator\ndependent,  or  have  cathetenzation  tubes  -are  living  at  home  with  their  families  with  support\n61\n\nservices  funded  h\\  Medicaid.  maternal  health  demonstration  grants  and  rhe Tennessee  M,He.  ^:\n;\nWaiver  program.

The  vast  maiornv\nof  Tennesseeans  witn  serious  medical  needs  do  not  go  to  institutions  to  receive  medical,\ntherapeutic  or  educational  services,  but  receive  those  services  m  their  own  homes  ami\ncommunities.\n269.  The  intent of  Congress,  in amending  the Social  Security  Act  in  1971 to allow  the\nslales to use Title XIX funds to pay for services in Intermediate Care Facilities for the  Mentally\nRetarded  (iCFs/MR),  was to support  \"[t]he active provision  of rehabilitative,  educational  and\ntranunii  services  to enhance the capacity of mentally retarded  individuals to care for  themselves\nor  to  engage  in  employment.\"  117  Cong.  Rec.  44720  (December  4,  1971).  The  unintended\nconsequence  of  the  use  of  ICT/MR  funds  by  state  officials  including  the  defendants  is  most\nICT/MR  dollars  have  flowed  to large,  custodial  institutions  where  little education  and  training\ntakes  place.\n270.  Under  the federal  ICF/MR  program,  federal  funds  pay  for 66% of the cost of care\nat  the developmental  centers.  The  ICwMR  program  in effect  gives  the  states a  right  to  draw\nagainst an open-ended  federal  bank account  for their state institutions as long as the state's own\nsurveyors continue  to certify  those  facilities.\n271. Tennessee is highly dependent upon the ICF/MR  funding  stream, not because of the\nprofessional  judgment  that persons with developmental  disability are appropriately  served  in an\nICF/MR  facility,  but  because  the  ICF/MR  program  provides  the  most  secure  and  stable  and\npredictable  form  of  federal  financial  assistance  to  states  for  service  delivery  to  persons  with\n62\n\ndevelopmental  disabilities.  Defendants\"  use o! 1CF MR funds u» susiain  its large, custodial  sta:e\ninstitutions  inhibits and slows the growth, and creation  of alternative  comnumitv-oased  ser\\ ice-\ntor persons with  .significant  disabilities.\n272.  DH surveyors have an inherent conflict of interest when tiiev survey a state  facility.\nThe  stale has a strong  fiscal  interest  in continued  Medieaid  reimbursement  tor services  at its\ndevelopmental  centers;  that  interest  is  jeopardized  when  surveyors  find  violations  of  the\nconditions of participation,\n273. Defendants'  1CF/MR survey process is inadequate.  DH surveyors fail to ensure that\nMedicaid-certified  facilities  in  Tennessee,  including  the  developmental  centers  and  other\nICFs/MR,  meet  minimum  standards for certification  for the receipt of Medieaid  funds  pursuant\nto Title  XIX of the Social  Security  Act.  Under  the Medieaid  regulations,  failure  to meet all\neigiit  of  the  ICF/MR  conditions  of  participation  requires  that  the  facility  be  decertified.\nHowever,  DH  surveyors  ignore  the  myriad  violations  of  the  ICF/MR  standards  at  the\ndevelopmental  centers;  they  routinely  certify  the  facilities  even  though  deficiencies  are so\nmassive that a reasonable surveyor could not find the institutions m compliance with the ICF'MR\nconditions of  participation.\nThe Benefits to  Plaintiffs\nof Living in Normal,  Integrated Community  Settings\n274.  Professional  judgment dictates that persons with significant disabilities be served in\nlife patterns that are integrated  with and similar  to those followed  by other persons. The vast\nmajority  of developmental disabilities professionals, public agencies and service providers now\nreject  the  medical  or  deficit  model  and  see  their  purpose  as  that  of  supporting  people  with\nsignificant  disability  in  normal,  integrated  residential  and  work  settings.  Professionals  now\n63\n\nbelieve  Ilia*  the UWK O; the semce  system  ;s nut :o a ^ gn 'he person  to ,~. taciht\ndiagnosis,  but to support  people  in homes  thev  choose  themselves,  where  thev enn\nmajor  national  organizations  concerned  witli people witii developmental  disabilities.\n275.  Longstanding  federal  policy  toward  people  with  developmental  disabilities,\narticulated  and  enacted  over  the  course  of  nearly  three  decades,  is  based  on  the  values  of\nindependence,  productivity  and  integration  of  citizens  with  disabilities.  That  policy  in  turn\nmirrors the professional  consensus that the proper place for people with developmental  disability\nis m normal  homes,  schools  and  workplaces  and  not  in segregated  ''facility-based\"  programs.\n28L  Defendants  themselves  recognize  that  it  is  good  tor  people  to  live  in  the  most\nnormal  setting possible. Thev  know  that persons with  significant  disabilities benefit  enormously\nfrom  opportunities to practice daily living skills in normal environments, and to exercise  choice\nand  judgment.\n276.  Defendants  acknowledge  and  accept  the  professional  consensus  that  persons  with\ndevelopmental  disabilities  should  not  go to large congregate  institutions to receive services.  In\n1989,  with the support of the Assistant Commissioner  for  Mental  Retardation,  a Tennessee  state\nlaw was enacted  to prohibit  the licensure and operation  of  any residential  facility  which  houses\nmore than eight persons with developmental disability.  If these developmental centers were new\nfacilities,  defendants  would  refuse  to license  them.\n277.  Defendants  acknowledge  that the  most  important  concepts  shaping  the delivery  of\ndevelopmental disability services during the last decade include \"normalization\" and  \"community\n64\n\nintegration\"  •  _  - _  -\ndisabilities-  \\  '\npersons  with  mental  retardation  and  related  condiiions  must  recognize  and  reilect  tnnr\nindividual's dignity as a person, his/her natural membership in a native society and community,\nand  his/her  right  to  live as closely  as  possible  in  the  manner  of  the  culture.\"  \"Community\nintegration,\"  according  to  defendants,  is  a  concept  \"reflecting  the  value  to  people  with\ndevelopmental  disabilities  of  sharing  in  community  life\"  that  includes  the  following  key\nprinciples:\n\"1)  physical  integration:  to be  a  member  of  a community  one\nmust  live  in  that  community;  2) cultural  integration:  to  be a\nmember  of  a  community  one  must  exhibit  culturally  valued\nlifestyles  and  roles;  3)  social  integration:  to be a  member  of a\ncommunity  one  must enjoy  reciprocal  interpersonal  relationships\nwith  other  community  members;  4)  self-determination:  to be a\nmember  of  a  community  one  must  be  able  to  affirm  one's\nindividuality  through  expressions  of  personal  independence  and\npreference  within the limits and according to the standards of the\ncommunity.\"\nDefendants acknowledge that these principles \"nave moved over time from  ideals promoted by\nadvocates, to predominant professional perspectives, to principles guiding the administration and\norganization  of  public  programs  ...  Today  they  are  explicitly  or  implicitly  recognized  as\nimportant  guiding  principles  by  most  state  mental  retardation/developmental  disabilities\nagencies,\" including the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.

Professionals  who work at the developmental centers arc in general agreement  that\nall residents could successfully  be placed in the community if provided with adequate support.\n65\n\n27Q.  r .  .  .\ndevelopment.  • ' • • . . •'  _\nsettinss  based  on  the  \"deficit\"  model.  Persons  with  disabilities  grow  and  gain  skills  and\novercome institution-imposed  regression  when provided  with opportunities to learn and  practice\nbasic  skills in  small,  well-structured,  supervised  community  settings.\n280.  In  the  last twelve  years,  a body  of  research  has developed  showing  what  happens\nto  the  quality  of  lite  of  people  with  developmental  disabilities  when  they  move  from  iarge\ncongregate  care  settings  to  community  living.  The  results  of  this  research  are  remarkably\nconsistent.  They  demonstrate  that  people are  better off  when  they  leave  large congregate  care\nsettings  for community  'living  in small,  family-scale  homes.\n281.  For  example,  in  a  five-year  study  commissioned  by  the  Secretary  of  the  U.  S.\nDepartment  of  Health  and  Human  Services comparing  the growth  and  development  of  persons\nmoved  from  Pennhurst  to family-scale  community  living arrangements,  researchers  monitoring\nresidents  for  five  years  found  that persons  with  severe disabilities  placed  in community  living\narrangements increased  in skills and developmental  growth  while residents of the institution  did\nnot.  The  federal  government  study  concluded  that  persons  who  moved  from  Pennhurst  to\ncommunity  placements  were  \"better off  in every  way.\"  J.  W.  Conroy  and  V. J.  Bradley,  The\nPennhurst  Longitudinal  Study:  A  Report  of  Five  Years  of  Research  and  Analysis,  Temple\nUniv..  Philadelphia,  PA (1985).  After  the initial  five-year  study was completed,  the authors of\nthe Pennhurst  Longitudinal  Study continued  to  follow  the  1700 members of the Pennhurst  class\nand  found  significant  continued  gains in growth  and  well-being.\n282.

Cunrov  ct  ah,  1990  Results  o\\  the  ('ARC  v .\nThorne  Longitudinal  Study  (1991)  (emphasis  in original).\n283.  These and  other  systematic  studies of what  happens to institutional  residents  when\nthey  move  to the community  have  found:\n(a) When  former  institutional  residents are placed  in the community,  they  make\nhighly  significant  gains in skills and development  (adaptive  behavior).\n(b) Former institutional  residents who move to the community  make  significantly\ngreater gains in adaptive behavior than persons with comparable needs who remain at the\ninstitution.\n(c)  When  people  who  are  labelled  severely  or  profoundly  retarded  move  into\nfamily-like community settings, they show even greater gains, proportionally,  in adaptive\nbehavior than persons labelled mildly and moderately retarded.  No support exists for the\nproposition  that some people are  \"too low  functioning\"  to succeed  in the  community.\n(d)  Although  the  initial  gains  in  adaptive  behavior  following  class  members'\nplacement  in the community  are generally  the most dramatic,  the gains do not  level  off\nbut  continue.  Former  institutional  residents  continue  to  make  significant  gains  in  the\ncommunity.\n(e)  Former  institutional  residents  make significant  gains  in  reducing  challenging\nor  maladaptive  behavior  after  they are placed  in the  community.\n(f)  An inverse relationship exists between  the size of a residential  setting and  the\n67\n\ndegree oi  communnv  integration  o;  us\n(g)  former  institutional  resident\ncommunity  than  they  received  at  the  institution.\n(h) Before  comnmnilv  placement,  the majonlv  o! families oi  inrmcr  ms'iiutiona'\nresidents are strongly opposed to communitv placenient of their relatives. However,  alter\ncommunity  placement,  this  pattern  is  completely  reversed1  The  majority  of  family\nmembers  become  strongly  supportive ol  community  placement.\n284. The experience of properly planned institutional closure in other states demonstrates\nthat virtually all residents of state institutions can  live in small,  integrated  residential  settings in\nthe  community,  and  that  closure  can  be  accomplished  without  adverse  effects  to  institutional\nresidents.\n285.  The  issue whether  people with  developmental  disabilities  are  better  off  in  familv-\nscale,  integrated  settings than  in large congregate  settings (settings oi  more than  15 beds)  is no\nlonger  an  issue  for  scholars  and  professionals  in  the  field.  There  is  strong  consensus  among\nscholars  who  have  studied  the  relation  between  size  and  quality  of  care  thai  family-scale\nresidences are better than institiitions for people with developmental  disability  in every  wav that\nIs measurable.\nDefendants*  Discriminatory  Exclusion\nof  Persons  With  Severe  Disabilities  From  the  Community\n286. Defendants refuse to refer class members for community placement because of their\nsevere and multiple disabilities.  Professional  recommendations  for community placement  cannot\nbe  made  or  acted  upon  because  of  the  unavailability  of  community  services  for  those  class\nmembers.\nm\n\nJo7.  Tennessee's  mental  retardation  program  embodies  the  obsolete  \"medical  ;;'o;.:ei,\"\nIt  is characterized  by  a  system  of  \"levels\"  of  residential  facilities  front  the  largest  and  most\nheavily  staffed  (Level  I) to the smallest  and  least  heaviiv  staffed  (Level  V).  Level  I  facilities\nare institutions;  Level  1! and  Level  III  facilities are large group homes with a minimum  of  tour\npersons:; levels III.5,  IV, and V are typical  homes, duplexes or apartments where residents  live\nsemi-independentlv.  Persons  seeking  services  are classified  by person's  level  of  function  and\nneed  for  supervision  and  training,  and  then  assigned  to a facility  of the corresponding  \"level.\"\nThis system leads to the assignment of persons with severe disabilities and complex needs to the\ndevelopmental  centers.  Lor  the  most part,  only  persons  with  mild  disabilities  are supported  in\ntvpicai  homes,  duplexes or apartments and  in homes  they choose  themselves.  This  system  is a\nsubstantial departure  from  the professional  consensus of the  field.  Bv continuing  to operate  this\nsystem,  defendants  discriminate  intentionally  against  persons  with  severe  and  profound\nintellectual  disabilities,  physical  disabilities,  challenging  behavior,  and  serious health  needs.\n288.  Defendants have failed to prevent their contractors (the community providers)  from\ndiscriminating against class members with severe disabilities.  Defendants  have failed  to provide\nfunding  on  a  per  diem  basis  for  community  services  that  is  equitable  in  comparison  to  the\nfunding  available to the institutions. The service system operated by defendants  is characterized\nby  absence  of  planning  and  lack  of  coordination  between  the  separate  agencies  that  share\nresponsibility  for  serving persons with developmental  disabilities.\n289. The Tenncare  Bureau and the Division of Mental  Retardation  have applied  for and\nreceived  a  waiver  from  the  Health  Care  Financing  Administration  of  the  United  States\nDepartment  of  Health  and  Human  Services  as  provided  under  Section  2176  of  the  Omnibus\n69\n\nBudget Reconciliation  Act of  1981.  The Section 2176 waiver allows Medicaid  fund-,  :>J 'v  used\nto support  a  variety  of  home  and  conimunitv  based  services  for  former  ICT  MR  residents  or\nthose who are at risk of  ICF/MR  placement. To obtain a waiver,  the state must show the Health\n('are  Financing  Administration  of the United  States Department  of  Health  and  Human  Sen ices\nthat it will use the waiver to close ICF/MR  beds or refrain  from  opening new ones.  The waiver\nprovides  the  same  federal  match—66  cents  tor  every  34  cents—that  defendants  receive  for\nservices at the developmental  centers.  Effective  use of the Federal  Medicaid  Waiver  Program\nwould enable Tennessee to provide integrated  services to persons currently  residing at all of the\nstate institutions at no greater expense to the state  treasury.\n290.  Defendants have failed  to use the waiver program  to provide home and  community-\nbased services for residents with the most significant disabilities.  Defendants arbitrarily  limit the\nper diem rates paid to community providers under the waiver to S107, while the per diem at the\ndevelopmental  centers  is at least $180.  If community  programs  were funded  at the same  level\nas  the  developmental  centers,  community  providers  could  develop  services  for  virtually\neveryone.  However,  the  $107  ceiling  makes  it difficult  or  impossible  to  develop  community\nservices  for  at least  half  the present  residents of  the developmental  center.\n291.  Defendants'  funding  mechanisms  arbitrarily  exclude  many  developmental  center\nresidents  with  significant  physical  disabilities  from  the community.  Many  class  members  with\nphysical  disabilities  could  live  in  their  own  homes  with  modest  staff  support  if  the  proper\nadaptive  equipment  and  modifications  to  assure  accessibility  were  made  available  to  them.\nHowever,  because defendants  arbitrarily  limit community  contractors* start-up  funds  to  $4,000\nper person,  it is rarely possible to  purchase the equipment and  the home modifications  needed\n70\n\nby those class members and  thus they are consigned  ;o mo uevuoppiun:.::  cente'S  ipce-lniieu .\n292.  Defendants  do  not  plan  tor  services  based  on  the  identified  needs  of  inuividuai\nclients.  Plaintiffs  are  placed  at  the  institutions  because  institutional  beds  are  available,  not\nbecause  that  service  meets their  individual  needs.\n293.  Defendants  have  chosen  to  allocate  the  majoritv  of  their  fiscal  resources  for\ndevelopmental  disabilities  services  to  the  institutions.  This  is  a  political,  not  a  professional\ndecision.  Class  members  are  denied  community  services,  not  because  of  the  professional\njudgment that they should be institutionalized, but because tlse distribution of resources is skewed\ntoward  the  institutions.\n294.  In  their  actions  and  inactions  recited  above,  defendants  have  failed  to  exercise\nprofessional  judgment.  Defendants'  actions and  inactions are such a substantial  departure  from\nprofessional  judgment,  standards and  practice as to demonstrate  that  they actually  did  not  base\ntheir decisions on professional judgment. In their actions and inactions recited above,  defendants\nhave acquiesced,  with deliberate  indifference,  in a policy  and  practice  of  failing  adequately  to\ntrain employees and in other policies, practices, customs and usages that are likely to result and\nhave resulted  in the violation  of class members'  constitutional  rights.\n295.  Comcare,  Inc.,  as  guardian  for  class  members  with  a  duty  to  act  in  their  best\ninterests,  has  consented  to,  and  thereby  aided  and  perpetuated,  the  continued  harm  of  class\nmembers' placement at developmental centers and the inadequate habitation  they receive there.\n296. The actions and inactions of defendants  that are recited above have resulted and will\ncontinue  to result  in harm,  injury,  and  regression.\n297.  Plaintiffs  have no adequate  remedy  at  law.\n\nClaims\nCount I:  Social Security Act\n298.

It includes a brief description of each service.  This list is \nnot all-inclusive; there continue to be new approaches to providing residential services in the \nDIDD (Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities) system.  This list is simply an \noverview of the most common models already in place. \nThere are two basic kinds of residential services:  Home and Community Based Waiver Services \n(HCBS) and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICFs/IID).  \nHCBS are provided under the State’s Medicaid HCBS Waiver program. \nThe Medicaid HCBS Waiver program provides services in the person’s home and community—\noutside of an ICF/IID. The person’s “own home” could be the home of a family member, or a \nhome or apartment that the person rents or owns. For some services, it could also be a home \nowned or leased by the provider. The person supported gets to help choose their home and who \nthey live with. Regardless of the kind of HCBS, the person is responsible for paying their living \nexpenses, including rent, utilities, food, etc.  \n \nTo receive HCBS waiver services, a person must qualify for ICF/IID services, but choose to \nreceive services in a more home-like setting.  Instead of one agency providing all services the \nperson needs (as it is in an ICF/IID), in the HCBS Waiver, the person or their conservator can \nchoose a provider for each waiver service they need.  The services the person needs will be part \nof their Individual Support Plan (ISP). These can include residential services, employment and \nday services, therapy services, nursing services, and other waiver services covered in the State’s \napproved waiver.  The person will also receive independent support coordination (ISC) services \nto develop their ISP, request needed services, and monitor the ISP and the delivery of services to \nassure that their needs are met. The person supported gets to lead the planning process to help \ndecide what kinds of services they need to live in their home and be part of their community. The \nresidential agency is selected by the person(s) supported and provides needed staffing to support \nthe person(s) with maintaining their home, managing the day-to-day routines in the home (meals, \ncleaning, hygiene, etc.), making sure each person’s needs are met, and helping each person be as \nindependent as possible and participate in their community.  Except for Medical Residential \nServices, the provider agency does not deliver medical services.  However, they are responsible \nfor helping to arrange the person’s medical appointments and transportation to those \nappointments. The provider agency is also responsible for providing needed transportation to \nsupport work, recreation and leisure activities. \nUnder federal law, ICFs/IID are institutions. The State’s Developmental Centers, including \nClover Bottom and Green Valley, are ICFs/IID.  The State also operates a limited number of 4-\nbed ICF/IIDs.  The State will not be building any more 4-bed homes. In addition, there are other \nICFs/IID that are operated by private (non-State) providers.  These also include many smaller 4-\nbed homes, some 8-bed homes, and a few larger facilities. Even though ICFs/IID are institutions, \nthe State and most other ICF/IID providers try to help make sure the ICF/IID feels like the \nperson’s home and that people in the ICF/IID also have opportunities to be part of their \ncommunities. \n1 \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1138-4   Filed 01/29/15   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 6240\n\n \nHCBS Waiver  Description \nService \nSupported Living   This is the most common type of residential living arrangement in \nTennessee.  A supported living home is a community home or apartment, \nleased or owned and controlled by the person(s) supported.  It is in their \nname, and it is their home.  No more than three people can live together \nand receive Supported Living services. The people who live in the home \n(or their conservators) get to help choose the staff who work in the \nhome—typically in shifts.  (Less often, the staff may live with the person \nin their home.) The person supported also gets to help choose their \nhousemates.  They also get to help decide how things are done in the \nhome, and have choice and control over their everyday lives. If the \nperson(s) supported want to change provider agencies, they do not have \nto physically move; it is their home.  A new provider agency replaces the \nexisting provider agency in the person’s current home at an agreed-upon \ndate. Supported living homes must pass a DIDD Site Inspection prior to \nthe person living and receiving services there.   \nResidential  Residential Habilitation services are provided in a home that is owned or \nHabilitation   leased and controlled by a provider agency.  These are often called \n“group homes.” Residential Habilitation homes can serve up to four \npeople unless they were started before 2000.  (There are a few larger \nhomes started before 2000 that serve up to ten people.)   The amount of \ninput that the persons served have in selecting support staff is more \nlimited.  People receiving Residential Habilitation services pay their room \nand board costs to the provider. Food and basic supply items are then paid \nfor by the agency, and the person is responsible for clothing items and \nother personal items.  The agency is responsible for upkeep and \nmaintenance of the home.  Generally the home is supported by shift staff, \nbut sometimes there is a live-in home manager.  Residential Habilitation \nhomes are inspected and licensed by the state. \nFamily Model  In family-model residential support, the person lives with no more than \nResidential  two other people receiving support in the home of a trained caregiver who \nSupport   is not the person’s family. The intent of this model is to make the \nperson(s) a part of the caregiver’s family and community.  The person or \nconservator should get to choose the Family Model Residential agency as \nwell as whether they want to live with a specific family model caregiver.  \nThe home is leased or owned and controlled by the caregiver. The person \npays room and board to the Family Model Residential Support provider. \nFood and basic supply items are paid for by the agency, and the person is \nresponsible for clothing items and other personal items.  The owner of the \nhome is responsible for maintenance and upkeep.  The home is inspected \nand monitored by the provider agency.   \nMedical  This type of residential service combines nursing services for people who \nResidential  need daily skilled nursing tasks with other supports needed to live safely \nServices  in the community.  Medical Residential Services is only for people who \n2 \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1138-4   Filed 01/29/15   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 6241\n\n \nneed skilled nursing tasks three or more times per day.  The nursing \nservices must be ordered by a licensed prescriber. In addition to shift \nsupport staff, a nurse is available to all persons who live there up to 24 \nhours a day, depending on the nursing needs of each person living in the \nhome.  (If needed medical services can be provided by short nursing visits \nup to three times a day, the person will not qualify for medical residential \nservices.) These homes may be supported living homes (owned or leased \nby the person) or residential habilitation homes (owned or leased by the \nprovider).  The home functions like either a Supported Living or \nResidential Habilitation home (see above), depending on how the home is \nlicensed, but with additional nursing services the person needs. \nICF/IID  ICF/IID services are not HCBS, even if the ICF/IID is operated by the \nServices  State or a private provider in the community.  ICF/IID services also \ndifferent from HCBS waivers services in part because the ICF/IID agency \nmust provide or arrange for all of the services the person needs (including \nresidential supports, employment and day services, medical and nursing \nservices, therapy services, dental services, etc.).  Room and board are part \nof the ICF/IID service, so the provider pays the person’s living expenses. \nHowever, under federal law, all of the person’s income (except for a \nsmall monthly personal spending allowance of between $30-$50/month) \nmust go to the provider to help offset the Medicaid cost of care. Even \nthough federal law says that ICFs/IID are institutions, of all of the kinds \nof HCBS Waiver residential services, they are most like Residential \nHabilitation homes. The person can choose the ICF/IID provider, but will \nnot get to choose the staff who provide needed support.  People receiving \nICF/IID services are supported by shift staff. A nurse may be \ncontinuously on site or may make visits to the home, depending upon the \nneeds of the persons who live there.  Most of these homes provide \nservices for four or eight persons, and the homes are owned and \ncontrolled by the provider agency. The person has no control over staff, \nhousemates, or other aspects of the operation of the home.  State law \nlimits the number of ICF/IID beds that can be available.  If this service is \nchosen, generally the person or conservator must choose a provider from \nthose agencies who have vacancies and are able and willing to meet the \nperson’s needs.  However, additional beds can be created by private \nproviders for people moving out of a Developmental Center. The State \nwill not be building any new ICF/IID homes. \n \n3 \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1138-4   Filed 01/29/15   Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 6242",

As indicated \nby the title of the filing, no party opposes the Joint Motion to Dismiss; to the contrary, all \nparties agree that dismissal is appropriate because it is uncontroverted that Defendants, Clover \nBottom Developmental Center, et al. (“State Defendants” or “Defendants”) have completed and \nfulfilled their obligations under the Exit Plan (ECF No. 1138-1) (the “Exit Plan”).  The Exit \nPlan is an agreement, ordered by the Court, that by its very terms was designed to lead to \ndismissal of the litigation upon the completion of objective and measurable criteria by State \nDefendants.  [See Exit Plan, p.1)].  The Exit Plan was developed through intensive negotiations \nconducted under the supervision of Magistrate Judge Griffin.  Further, since the Exit Plan was \napproved by this Court, Defendants effort and progress at meeting the obligations that, if met, \nwould lead to \n1 \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1213   Filed 09/08/17   Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 6495\n\ndismissal have been closely monitored by the Court through the assigned magistrate judge, first \nJudge Griffin and, upon her retirement, Judge Holmes.  As described in detail below, together \nMagistrate Judges Griffin and Holmes have entered Report and Recommendations (“R&Rs”) \nfinding that State Defendants have completed all material obligations of the Exit Plan. \nOn January 29, 2015, after an evidentiary hearing and with notice of the hearing being \nprovided through publication in all regions of Tennessee, the Exit Plan was approved by this \nCourt pursuant to Rule 23(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  [See Order, ECF No. \n1137, and Memorandum, ECF 1136, filed on January 29, 2015].  On that same day, the Court \nentered the Agreed Order.  (See ECF No. 1138 (the “2015 Agreed Order”)]. \nThe 2015 Agreed Order describes State Defendants’ responsibilities associated with the \nExit Plan, sets regular compliance conferences with the magistrate judge to oversee State \nDefendants’ progress in complying with the requirements of the Exit Plan, establishes a system \nfor the entry of Reports and Recommendations by the magistrate judge when it is determined \nthat material provisions of the Exit Plans have been completed by State Defendants, and \nestablishes when partial and complete dismissal of the case is required.  Id.  The 2015 Agreed \nOrder contemplates that the captioned action will be resolved by the completion of all material \nprovisions of the Exit Plan in two phases:  first, State Defendants are required to meet all \nmaterial obligations in Sections II-IX; and, second, they must comply with all material \nobligations of Section X.  Id., ¶1.  Section X of the Exit Plan sets forth the specific criteria under \nwhich Defendants’ last congregate care institution, Greene Valley Developmental Center \n(“GVDC”), would be closed.  (See Exit Plan, Section X). \nWith regard to the first phase, the 2015 Agreed Order provides that upon the completion \nof the material obligations of Sections II-IX of the Exit Plan, the Court will enter an order \n2 \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1213   Filed 09/08/17   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 6496\n\n“vacating all outstanding injunctive relief in the CBDC Litigation except that relief that applies \nto Greene Valley Developmental Center ([the injunctive relief remaining in place] shall be \nreferred to as the ‘GVDC Injunctive Relief’).”  Id. at ¶2.  On December 15, 2015, the \nMagistrate Judge issued a R&R finding, in part, that the State Defendants had complied with all \nmaterial provisions of Section II-IX of the Exit Plan (ECF No. 1158) and that R&R was \naccepted and approved by Order of this Court on January 8, 2016 (ECF No. 1160).  In \naccordance with the terms of the 2015 Agreed Order, paragraphs 2 and 8, this Court then \nentered the Agreed Order Vacating Injunctive Relief and Partially Dismissing Case with \nPrejudice.  [See Order, ECF No. 1162, entered on January 15, 2016 (the “Order of Partial \nDismissal].\nWith regard to second phase, the 2015 Agreed Order provides that upon the completion \nof the material obligations of Section X of the Exit Plan, the Court “shall vacate the GVDC \nInjunctive Relief and finally and fully dismiss [the case] with prejudice in all respects.”1  On \nJune 30, 2017, the Magistrate Judge issued a R&R finding that State Defendants had complied \nwith all material provisions of Section X of the Exit Plan .  [See ECF No. 1203 (the “June 30 \nR&R”)].  The parties did not file an objection to the June 30 R&R and, hence, it became final \nand binding on July 15, 2017.  Moreover, based upon this Joint Motion and the submission of the \nAgreed Order attached as Exhibit A, the parties agree that State Defendants have completed \nSection X of the Exit Plan, as they agreed in 2016 that the State had completed Sections II-IX of \nthe Exit Plan. \n1 The 2015 Agreed Order establishes that Section X must be completed by June 30, 2016.  (See 2015 Agreed Order, \n¶3).   With regard to that deadline and keeping in mind that it revolves around the closure of GVDC, the parties \ndecided that the safety of the class members transitioning from GVDC was more important than closing it by an \narbitrary date.  Thus, the 2015 Agreed Order also provides State Defendants with the right unilaterally to extend the \ndeadline for completion of Section X through June 30, 2017.  (Id. at ¶19).  The State provided notice to the parties \nand the Court that it was exercising that right in two filings.  [See Notices filed on June 29, 2016, and December 28, \n2016, ECF Nos. 1174 and 1191].  Thus, the operative deadline for completing the material provisions of Section X \nwas June 30, 2017.   \n3 \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1213   Filed 09/08/17   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 6497\n\nOn de novo review of the Magistrate Judge’s June 30 R&R and the R&R issued on June \n27, 2017 (ECF No. 1201), the Court hereby ADOPTS both.  The Court FINDS that \nDefendants have complied with and completed all material provisions in Section X of the Exit \nPlan. \n Based on these findings and the entire record in this cause, IT IS ORDERED, \nADJUDGED AND DECREED that:\n1. Pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 17 of the 2015 Agreed Order approving the Exit Plan, all\n \nremaining outstanding injunctive relief entered in this case, which previously had not \nbeen vacated, is hereby VACATED;   \n2. Pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 17 of the 2015 Agreed Order approving the Exit Plan, this\ncase is finally and forever DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE in all respects.  \n3. The Court further finds that, as dismissal is based on the merits, this is not a settlement,\nvoluntary dismissal or compromise, and, therefore, separate notice to the class is not required; \n4. The Court shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in this matter solely and exclusively,\nand for a limited period of time, to resolve any claim or disputes regarding attorney fees related \nto this matter.  Parties seeking attorney fees shall file an appropriate motion, along with any \nnecessary supporting documentation, within 45 days of the entry of this Order.  Once any issues \nwith attorney fees are resolved, or 45 days after the entry of this Order if no motion for fees is \nfiled by any party, this Court shall relinquish jurisdiction of this sole, remaining issue.\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n______________________________________  \nWAVERLY D.

This  list  is  simply  an  \noverview  of  the  most  common  models  already  in  place.  \nThere  are  two  basic  kinds  of  residential  services:   Home  and  Community  Based  Waiver  Services  \n(HCBS)  and  Intermediate  Care  Facilities  for  Individuals  with  Intellectual  Disabilities  (ICFs/IID).   \nHCBS  are  provided  under  the  State’s  Medicaid  HCBS  Waiver  program.  \nThe  Medicaid  HCBS  Waiver  program  provides  services  in  the  person’s  home  and  community— \noutside  of  an  ICF/IID.  The  person’s  “own  home”  could  be  the  home  of  a  family  member,  or  a  \nhome  or  apartment  that  the  person  rents  or  owns.  For  some  services,  it  could  also  be  a  home  \nowned  or  leased  by  the  provider.  The  person  supported  gets  to  help  choose  their  home  and  who  \nthey  live  with.  Regardless  of  the  kind  of  HCBS,  the  person  is  responsible  for  paying  their  living  \nexpenses,  including  rent,  utilities,  food,  etc.   \n \nTo  receive  HCBS  waiver  services,  a  person  must  qualify  for  ICF/IID  services,  but  choose  to  \nreceive  services  in  a  more  home-like  setting.   Instead  of  one  agency  providing  all  services  the  \nperson  needs  (as  it  is  in  an  ICF/IID),  in  the  HCBS  Waiver,  the  person  or  their  conservator  can  \nchoose  a  provider  for  each  waiver  service  they  need.   The  services  the  person  needs  will  be  part  \nof  their  Individual  Support  Plan  (ISP).  These  can  include  residential  services,  employment  and  \nday  services,  therapy  services,  nursing  services,  and  other  waiver  services  covered  in  the  State’s  \napproved  waiver.   The  person  will  also  receive  independent  support  coordination  (ISC)  services  \nto  develop  their  ISP,  request  needed  services,  and  monitor  the  ISP  and  the  delivery  of  services  to  \nassure  that  their  needs  are  met.  The  person  supported  gets  to  lead  the  planning  process  to  help  \ndecide  what  kinds  of  services  they  need  to  live  in  their  home  and  be  part  of  their  community.  The  \nresidential  agency  is  selected  by  the  person(s)  supported  and  provides  needed  staffing  to  support  \nthe  person(s)  with  maintaining  their  home,  managing  the  day-to-day  routines  in  the  home  (meals,  \ncleaning,  hygiene,  etc.),  making  sure  each  person’s  needs  are  met,  and  helping  each  person  be  as  \nindependent  as  possible  and  participate  in  their  community.   Except  for  Medical  Residential  \nServices,  the  provider  agency  does  not  deliver  medical  services.   However,  they  are  responsible  \nfor  helping  to  arrange  the  person’s  medical  appointments  and  transportation  to  those  \nappointments.  The  provider  agency  is  also  responsible  for  providing  needed  transportation  to  \nsupport  work,  recreation  and  leisure  activities.  \nUnder  federal  law,  ICFs/IID  are  institutions.  The  State’s  Developmental  Centers,  including  \nClover  Bottom  and  Green  Valley,  are  ICFs/IID.   The  State  also  operates  a  limited  number  of  4­\nbed  ICF/IIDs.   The  State  will  not  be  building  any  more  4-bed  homes.  In  addition,  there  are  other  \nICFs/IID  that  are  operated  by  private  (non-State)  providers.   These  also  include  many  smaller  4­\nbed  homes,  some  8-bed  homes,  and  a  few  larger  facilities.  Even  though  ICFs/IID  are  institutions,  \nthe  State  and  most  other  ICF/IID  providers  try  to  help  make  sure  the  ICF/IID  feels  like  the  \nperson’s  home  and  that  people  in  the  ICF/IID  also  have  opportunities  to  be  part  of  their  \ncommunities.  \n1 \n­\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1138-4   Filed 01/29/15   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 6240 \n\n \nHCBS  Waiver   Description  \nService  \nSupported  Living    This  is  the  most  common  type  of  residential  living  arrangement  in  \nTennessee.   A  supported  living  home  is  a  community  home  or  apartment,  \nleased  or  owned  and  controlled  by  the  person(s)  supported.   It  is  in  their  \nname,  and  it  is  their  home.   No  more  than  three  people  can  live  together  \nand  receive  Supported  Living  services.  The  people  who  live  in  the  home  \n(or  their  conservators)  get  to  help  choose  the  staff  who  work  in  the  \nhome—typically  in  shifts.   (Less  often,  the  staff  may  live  with  the  person  \nin  their  home.)  The  person  supported  also  gets  to  help  choose  their  \nhousemates.   They  also  get  to  help  decide  how  things  are  done  in  the  \nhome,  and  have  choice  and  control  over  their  everyday  lives.  If  the  \nperson(s)  supported  want  to  change  provider  agencies,  they  do  not  have  \nto  physically  move;  it  is  their  home.   A  new  provider  agency  replaces  the  \nexisting  provider  agency  in  the  person’s  current  home  at  an  agreed-upon  \ndate.  Supported  living  homes  must  pass  a  DIDD  Site  Inspection  prior  to  \nthe  person  living  and  receiving  services  there.    \nResidential   Residential  Habilitation  services  are  provided  in  a  home  that  is  owned  or  \nHabilitation    leased  and  controlled  by  a  provider  agency.   These  are  often  called  \n“group  homes.”  Residential  Habilitation  homes  can  serve  up  to  four  \npeople  unless  they  were  started  before  2000.   (There  are  a  few  larger  \nhomes  started  before  2000  that  serve  up  to  ten  people.)    The  amount  of  \ninput  that  the  persons  served  have  in  selecting  support  staff  is  more  \nlimited.   People  receiving  Residential  Habilitation  services  pay  their  room  \nand  board  costs  to  the  provider.  Food  and  basic  supply  items  are  then  paid  \nfor  by  the  agency,  and  the  person  is  responsible  for  clothing  items  and  \nother  personal  items.   The  agency  is  responsible  for  upkeep  and  \nmaintenance  of  the  home.   Generally  the  home  is  supported  by  shift  staff,  \nbut  sometimes  there  is  a  live-in  home  manager.   Residential  Habilitation  \nhomes  are  inspected  and  licensed  by  the  state.  \nFamily  Model   In  family-model  residential  support,  the  person  lives  with  no  more  than  \nResidential   two  other  people  receiving  support  in  the  home  of  a  trained  caregiver  who  \nSupport    is  not  the  person’s  family.  The  intent  of  this  model  is  to  make  the  \nperson(s)  a  part  of  the  caregiver’s  family  and  community.   The  person  or  \nconservator  should  get  to  choose  the  Family  Model  Residential  agency  as  \nwell  as  whether  they  want  to  live  with  a  specific  family  model  caregiver.   \nThe  home  is  leased  or  owned  and  controlled  by  the  caregiver.  The  person  \npays  room  and  board  to  the  Family  Model  Residential  Support  provider.  \nFood  and  basic  supply  items  are  paid  for  by  the  agency,  and  the  person  is  \nresponsible  for  clothing  items  and  other  personal  items.   The  owner  of  the  \nhome  is  responsible  for  maintenance  and  upkeep.   The  home  is  inspected  \nand  monitored  by  the  provider  agency.    \nMedical   This  type  of  residential  service  combines  nursing  services  for  people  who  \nResidential   need  daily  skilled  nursing  tasks  with  other  supports  needed  to  live  safely  \nServices   in  the  community.   Medical  Residential  Services  is  only  for  people  who  \n2  \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1138-4   Filed 01/29/15   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 6241 \n\n \nneed  skilled  nursing  tasks  three  or  more  times  per  day.   The  nursing  \nservices  must  be  ordered  by  a  licensed  prescriber.  In  addition  to  shift  \nsupport  staff,  a  nurse  is  available  to  all  persons  who  live  there  up  to  24  \nhours  a  day,  depending  on  the  nursing  needs  of  each  person  living  in  the  \nhome.   (If  needed  medical  services  can  be  provided  by  short  nursing  visits  \nup  to  three  times  a  day,  the  person  will  not  qualify  for  medical  residential  \nservices.)  These  homes  may  be  supported  living  homes  (owned  or  leased  \nby  the  person)  or  residential  habilitation  homes  (owned  or  leased  by  the  \nprovider).   The  home  functions  like  either  a  Supported  Living  or  \nResidential  Habilitation  home  (see  above),  depending  on  how  the  home  is  \nlicensed,  but  with  additional  nursing  services  the  person  needs.  \nICF/IID   ICF/IID  services  are  not  HCBS,  even  if  the  ICF/IID  is  operated  by  the  \nServices   State  or  a  private  provider  in  the  community.   ICF/IID  services  also  \ndifferent  from  HCBS  waivers  services  in  part  because  the  ICF/IID  agency  \nmust  provide  or  arrange  for  all  of  the  services  the  person  needs  (including  \nresidential  supports,  employment  and  day  services,  medical  and  nursing  \nservices,  therapy  services,  dental  services,  etc.).   Room  and  board  are  part  \nof  the  ICF/IID  service,  so  the  provider  pays  the  person’s  living  expenses.  \nHowever,  under  federal  law,  all  of  the  person’s  income  (except  for  a  \nsmall  monthly  personal  spending  allowance  of  between  $30-$50/month)  \nmust  go  to  the  provider  to  help  offset  the  Medicaid  cost  of  care.  Even  \nthough  federal  law  says  that  ICFs/IID  are  institutions,  of  all  of  the  kinds  \nof  HCBS  Waiver  residential  services,  they  are  most  like  Residential  \nHabilitation  homes.  The  person  can  choose  the  ICF/IID  provider,  but  will  \nnot  get  to  choose  the  staff  who  provide  needed  support.   People  receiving  \nICF/IID  services  are  supported  by  shift  staff.  A  nurse  may  be  \ncontinuously  on  site  or  may  make  visits  to  the  home,  depending  upon  the  \nneeds  of  the  persons  who  live  there.   Most  of  these  homes  provide  \nservices  for  four  or  eight  persons,  and  the  homes  are  owned  and  \ncontrolled  by  the  provider  agency.  The  person  has  no  control  over  staff,  \nhousemates,  or  other  aspects  of  the  operation  of  the  home.   State  law  \nlimits  the  number  of  ICF/IID  beds  that  can  be  available.   If  this  service  is  \nchosen,  generally  the  person  or  conservator  must  choose  a  provider  from  \nthose  agencies  who  have  vacancies  and  are  able  and  willing  to  meet  the  \nperson’s  needs.   However,  additional  beds  can  be  created  by  private  \nproviders  for  people  moving  out  of  a  Developmental  Center.  The  State  \nwill  not  be  building  any  new  ICF/IID  homes.  \n \n3  \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1138-4   Filed 01/29/15   Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 6242 ",

This  motion  is  the  culmination  of  intense \nnegotiations between the Parties, Plaintiffs United States of America (the “United States”), \nPeople First of Tennessee, Inc. (“People First”), and Intervenors Parent Guardian Association of \nClover Bottom Developmental Center (“PGACB”) and Parent Guardian Association of Green \nValley Developmental Center (“PGAGV”), and Defendants, the State of Tennessee, et al.   \nAlso pending is a Motion to Intervene filed by a group of conservators for family \nmembers residing at the State’s last remaining institution, Green Valley Developmental Center \n(“GVDC”)  (Brian  Bragdon,  Lisa  Hill,  Gail  King,  Ricky  Lingerfelt,  Gena  Wexler,  Russell \nWexler,  Leonard  Wyrick  Jr.)  and  a  nonprofit  organization  Citizens  for  a  Better  Tennessee \n(collectively “Movants”) (Docket No. 1121).  For the following reasons, the Court will approve \nthe Exit Plan and enter the Agreed Order.  The Motion to Intervene will be denied. \n \n1 \n \n\nI. Facts \nOn May 7, 2014, the Court ordered the Parties to participate in a settlement conference in \norder to reach resolution in this litigation, which has spanned twenty years (Docket No. 1101).  \nOver the course of many conferences with Magistrate Judge Griffin, the Parties drafted an Exit \nPlan, which “sets forth objective and measurable exit criteria that, together with the proposed \nAgreed Order, provide for the dismissal of this action with prejudice upon the State’s satisfaction \nof those criteria.”  (Docket No. 1118 at 2).    \nThe terms of the Exit Plan, to be completed in two phases concluding June 30, 2016,1 are \nset forth in detail in the proposed Agreed Order (Docket No. 1118-2).  They include, inter alia, \nimplementation of revised Individual Support Plans and Quality Assurance tools, and further \ntraining for staff of Independent Support Coordination Agencies, case managers, residential and \nday services providers, and law enforcement.2  The Exit Plan further provides for refinements to \nthe  use  of  psychotropic  medications  for  individuals  with  intellectual  or  developmental \ndisabilities, including Family Training, examination of authorization criteria for reimbursement \nof  psychotropic  medications  by  the  TennCare  Pharmacy  Advisory  Committee,  and \nstandardization  of  the  referral  process  to  regional  Psychopharmacology  Review  teams.3    It \nprovides for the establishment of behavior respite services and behavioral crisis prevention,4 and \neducation and enrollment of class members in SelectCommunity.5  Finally, the Exit Plan notes \n                                                            \n1 The Exit Plan provides that “any failure to complete an obligation required to be completed by a date prior to June \n30, 2016 shall not be deemed to constitute a failure to satisfy a material provision of this Exit Plan so long as the \nobligation is satisfied on or before June 30, 2017.”  (Docket No. 1118-1 at 2-3). \n \n2 Id. at §§ III, VI. \n \n3 Id. at § IV. \n \n4 Id. at § V. \n \n5 Id. at § VII. \n2 \n \n\nthe State’s revision of the Freedom of Choice Form setting forth the rights of persons choosing to \nreceive care at an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities.6   \nAfter entry of the proposed Agreed Order, the State will announce the closure of GVDC \nand prepare Individual Support Transition Plans for all class members residing there.7  This final \nsection prompted the Motion to Intervene from Movants, who strongly contest the cessation of \nservices at the institution (Docket No. 1121).  Though all residents of GVDC are class members \nrepresented by Plaintiff People First of Tennessee, Movants seek to carve out a second class \ncomprised of “all profoundly disabled persons receiving care or programs from the defendants” \nor, alternatively, “all profoundly disabled persons residing now or in the past five years at GVDC \nand  their  conservators.”    (Id.  at  17).    They  request  the  Court  “[i]ssue  a  preliminary  and \npermanent injunction order under Rule 65, F. R. CIV. P. to enjoin the closing of GVDC and to \nrequire adequate resources, staffing and care for profoundly disabled persons” and “declaratory \njudgment that the present level of resources, staffing and care for profoundly disabled persons in \nTennessee violates their constitutional rights under the 5th and 14th Amendments, federal and \nstate laws.”  (Docket No. 1121-2 at 20).  This motion will be treated further in the analysis \nbelow.    \nII.  Analysis \nA.  The Proposed Exit Plan and Agreed Order \nPrior to approving a proposed settlement in a class action, the district court must find a \nsettlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(2).  It must also conduct a \nfairness hearing, which acts as an additional “procedural safeguard” for the parties to “proffer \n                                                            \n6 Id. at §  VIII. \n \n7 Id. at § X. \n3 \n \n\nsufficient  evidence  to  allow  the  district  court  to  review  the  terms  and  legitimacy  of  the \nsettlement.”  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace, and Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. \nGen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 635 (6th Cir. 2007) (hereinafter “UAW”).  Throughout this \ninquiry, the district court retains “wide latitude” to limit the information presented by the parties \n“to whatever is necessary to aid it in reaching an informed, just and reasoned decision.”  Id. \n(quoting Tenn. Ass’n. of Health Maint. Orgs. v. Grier, 262 F.3d 559, 567 (6th Cir. 2001)). \nCourts in the Sixth Circuit look to several factors to determine whether a proposed \nsettlement agreement meets the requirements of Rule 23(e)(2): “(1) the risk of fraud or collusion; \n(2) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the amount of discovery \nengaged in by the parties; (4) the likelihood of success on the merits; (5) the opinions of class \ncounsel and class representatives; (6) the reaction of absent class members; and (7) the public \ninterest.”  UAW, 497 F.3d at 631.  District courts engaging in this assessment “enjoy[] wide \ndiscretion in assessing the weight and applicability of these factors.  Todd v. Retail Concepts, \nInc., 2008 WL 3981593, at *4 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 22, 2008) (citing Granada Invs., Inc. v. DWG \nCorp., 962 F.2d 1203, 1205-06 (6th Cir. 1992)).   \n“The fairness of each settlement turns in large part on the bona fides of the parties’ legal \ndispute.”  UAW, 497 F.3d at 631.  The Court’s task is not to decide which Party’s argument is \nstronger, as this would “defeat the purpose of a settlement in order to approve a settlement.”  Id. \nat 632.  “The question rather is whether the parties are using settlement to resolve a legitimate \nlegal and factual disagreement.”  Id.  A review of the procedural history of this long-running \ndispute, and of the Exit Plan and Agreed Order, leads the Court to conclude the Parties’ proposed \nsettlement is fair and appropriate.  The factors below are particularly instructive. \n4 \n \n\n  First, no evidence of fraud or collusion has been presented, nor is any suggested.  See Se. \nMilk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL 2155379, at *4 (E.D. Tenn. May 17, 2013) (“Courts respect the \nintegrity of counsel and presume the absence of fraud or collusion in negotiating the settlement, \nunless evidence to the contrary is offered.”) (quoting In re Packaged Ice Antitrust Litig., 2011 \nWL 6209188, at *14 (E.D. Mich. July 13, 2006) (internal citations omitted)).  Both Parties are \nrepresented  by  experienced  counsel  and  settlement  negotiations  have  been  overseen  by \nMagistrate Judge Griffin.  Furthermore, experienced class members have also played an active \nrole in drafting the Exit Plan and Agreed Order. \n  Second, the Court is mindful that “‘[m]ost class actions are inherently complex and \nsettlement avoids the costs, delays, and a multitude of other problems associated with them.’”  \nSe. Milk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL 2155379, at *4 (quoting In re Telectronics Pacing Sys. Inc., \n137 F. Supp. 2d 985, 1013 (S.D. Ohio 2001)).  In the event the Exit Plan is not approved, the \nspecter of further litigation looms large.  Defendants have reserved the right to abandon the \nsettlement plan if the Court does not enter the Agreed Order by January 31, 2015 (Docket No. \n1118-1 at 2).  Thus, if this step forward is unsuccessful, the Parties will very likely be launched \nmany steps back. \n  As for the likelihood of success on the merits, at the fairness hearing, counsel for Plaintiff \nPeople  First  of  Tennessee  highlighted  aspects  of  the  settlement  that  would  have  been \nunattainable through litigation, specifically establishment of a Quality Review Panel to oversee \nclosure of GVDC, a detailed framework for training of Independent Support Coordinators, and \nthe strengthening of mental health intervention services to avert behavioral crises.  Thus, it \nappears collaboration has fostered what may be a more positive result for Plaintiffs than would \nbe achievable even through successful litigation (Transcript of Record, Jan. 21, 2015 at 13:52).  \n5 \n \n\nAs noted by counsel for Plaintiff United States, the Exit Plan brings to fruition the promise of the \nsettlement agreement and goes farther than the Court could require.  \n  This also makes clear that the Exit Plan has the support of class counsel and class \nrepresentatives.  “The judgment of experienced counsel and class representatives regarding the \nsettlement should be given significant weight.”  Se. Milk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL 2155379, at \n*5.  “Their collective judgment that the settlement is in the best interest of class members weighs \nheavily in favor of the Court’s final approval of the Agreement.”  Id.  While Movants have \nvoiced strong dissent to one section, the Exit Plan is largely supported and the product of long, \nhard  collaboration  between  the  Parties.    See  Todd,  2008  WL  3981593,  at  *  5  (approving \nsettlement where “[b]oth sides are represented by able and experienced class counsel who hold \nthe opinion that the Settlement Agreement should receive final approval.”) \n  Finally, the proposed settlement benefits the public interest.  See UAW, 497 F.3d at 632 \n(noting the “federal policy favoring settlement in class actions” when approving the proposed \nsettlement between a labor union and auto manufacturer); Se. Milk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL \n2155379,  at  *7  (“[T]here  is  a  public  interest  in  settlement  of  disputed  cases  that  require \nsubstantial federal judicial resources to supervise and resolve.”).  The terms of the Exit Plan are a \nroadmap for the most recent reforms in a deinstitutionalization effort that began decades ago.  \nThe Supreme Court of the United States played a hand in this movement when, in Olmstead v. \nL.C. ex rel. Zimring, it recognized “unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities \nis a form of discrimination” that “perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated \nare incapable or unworthy of participating in community life” and “severely diminishes the \neveryday life activities of individuals.”  527 U.S. 581, 600-05 (1999) (balancing this concern \nwith the State’s role as administrator of services for people with mental disabilities, the Court \n6 \n \n\nalso noted that States must have “leeway” to “maintain a range of facilities and to administer \nservices.”).  \n  For these reasons, the Court concludes the settlement agreement meets the requirements \nof Rule 23(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The Exit Plan will be approved and the \nproposed Agreed Order entered. \nB.    The Motion to Intervene \n    Mindful of these public interest benefits, the Court turns to the Motion to Intervene.  \nMovants seek to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) and for \npermissive intervention under Rule 24(b).  They request the Court enjoin closure of GVDC and \nprovide  for  sufficient  resources  to  care  for  profoundly  disabled  residents.    While  deeply \nempathetic to Movants’ concerns, the Court concludes this motion must be denied, as it fails to \nsatisfy the elements for intervention and would require the Court act in a matter reserved to the \ndiscretion of the State. \n  Each of the conservators is the family member of a profoundly disabled person who has \nresided at CVDG for over thirty years.  Through many affidavits, Movants shared personal \nstories of the exceptional care their family members received at GVDC and fears for the physical \nhealth and emotional wellbeing of residents who would be moved from the place they considered \nhome. \n  In response to these concerns, counsel for the Parties explained the detailed transfer plan \ncreated to ensure residents’ smooth transition, the wide array of alternative equivalent care \noptions available, and the motivation for reform of the prior institutionalization framework with \nclosure of the last remaining State institution.     \n \n7 \n \n\ni.  Intervention by Right \n  In the Sixth Circuit, “proposed intervenors must meet four criteria before intervention by \nright is permitted: (1) the application for intervention must be timely; (2) the applicant must have \na substantial, legal interest in the subject matter of the pending litigation; (3) the applicant’s \nability to protect that interest must be impaired; and (4) the present parties do not adequately \nrepresent the applicant’s interest. The proposed intervenor must prove each of the four factors; \nfailure to meet one of the criteria will require that the motion to intervene be denied.”  Grubbs v. \nNorris, 870 F.2d 343, 345 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing Triax Co. v. TRW Inc., 724 F.2d 1224, 1227 \n(6th Cir. 1984)).  Here, Movants fail to meet the first element. \n  When considering whether an application for intervention is timely, courts consider five \nfactors  in  the  context  of  all  relevant  circumstances:  “(1)  the  point  to  which  the  suit  has \nprogressed; (2) the purpose for which intervention is sought; (3) the length of time preceding the \napplication during which the proposed intervenor knew or reasonably should have known of his \ninterest in the case; (4) the prejudice to the original parties due to the proposed intervenor’s \nfailure, after he or she knew or reasonably should have known of his or her interest in the case, to \napply  promptly  for  intervention;  and  (5)  the  existence  of  unusual  circumstances  militating \nagainst or in favor of intervention.”  Id. at 345-46. \n  Movants’ motion was filed on January 17, 2015, four days before the scheduled fairness \nhearing.  Movants argue the “first and only notice that the closing of GVDC was an issue” was \nJanuary 6, 2015, when the Parties filed the joint motion seeking approval of the Exit Plan and \nentry of the proposed Agreed Order (Docket No. 1121-1 at 3).  However, as early as 1996, \nPlaintiff People First of Tennessee, on behalf of its class members (including all residents of \nGVDC), sought development of “community living arrangements for all members of the plaintiff \n8 \n \n\nclass  for  whom  such  living  arrangements  are  called  for”  as  well  as  “community  services \nnecessary to provide class members with minimally adequate habilitation.”  (Docket No. 48 at \n80).  The Settlement Agreement reached in 1999 also sought to provide class members the “least \nseparate, most integrated setting appropriate to meet his or her individual needs.”  (Docket No. \n327 at 3).  Since the commencement of this litigation and related disputes, the three other State-\nrun institutions have closed.   \nIn light of this background and procedural history, the Court agrees with Defendants that \na consistent goal of this action has been “to move class members into community based homes \nand out of the congregate institutional environment.”  (Docket No. 1123 at 6).  Thus, Movants \nshould have reasonably known closure of GVDC might be a concern from very early in the \ncourse of this litigation and could not have learned of it first when the Parties filed the joint \nmotion to approve the Exit Plan and enter the Agreed Order.  \n  Furthermore, the Parties – including class members who have already moved out of \nGVDC  and  the  other  now-closed  institutions  –  would  be  significantly  prejudiced  should \nMovants’ request be granted and litigation continue, as they stand to benefit from the increased \ntraining for care providers and other institutional reforms provided for in the Exit Plan.  Those \nclass members, it should be noted, have largely successfully transitioned to alternative programs.   \n  Because Movants fail the first element required to intervene as of right under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), the motion must be denied.   \nThe Court adds that even if the Motion to Intervene were timely, Movants still cannot \nsatisfy the remaining elements for intervention by right.  Movants have not shown a legally \nprotectable interest in the provision of the Exit Plan that concerns closure of CVDG.  The \nParties, the Tennessee Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and \n9 \n \n\nMedicaid  Services  (CMS),8  and  case  law  within  the  Sixth  Circuit  and  other  jurisdictions9 \nuniformly support the assertion that the power to close GVDC rests with the State.  Nor have \nMovants shown their interests are unrepresented.  As noted by Plaintiffs, “[t]he fact that the \nPGAs agreed to compromise does not mean that they did not share and vigorously advocate the \nmovants’ interests.”  (Document No. 1133 at 3).             \nii.  Permissive Intervention  \n“To intervene permissively, a proposed intervenor must establish that the motion for \nintervention is timely and alleges at least one common question of law or fact.”  United States v. \nMichigan, 424 F.3d 438, 445 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Michigan State AFL–CIO v. Miller, 103 \nF.3d 1240, 1248 (6th Cir. 1997)).  “Once these two requirements are established, the district \ncourt must then balance undue delay and prejudice to the original parties, if any, and any other \nrelevant factors to determine whether, in the court’s discretion, intervention should be allowed.”  \nId. \n                                                            \n8 As noted in Plaintiffs’ “Response in Opposition to Brian Bragdon et al.’s Supplemental Memorandum of Law on \nTimeliness, Class Action, and Lack of Fairness in Proposed Final Order” (Docket No. 1133 at 4), “the PGAs have \nadvocated since the earliest days of this litigation that parents and guardians should be allowed to choose a \ncontinued stay at the institutions” which led the State of Tennessee to submit an inquiry to CMS regarding whether \nthe Social Security Act required Tennessee to allow a Medicaid beneficiary “to remain in a state institution even \nthough the state had decided that the person should be served elsewhere.”  (Id.).  The CMS confirmed “the Social \nSecurity Act did not require an unwilling provider … to continue to provide services that it had determined were \ninappropriate.”  (Id., see Docket No. 749, Exh. B).  \n  \n9 See e.g., United States v. Tenn., 2005 WL 1506480, at *5 n.3 (6th Cir. June 23, 2005), People First of Tenn. v. \nClover Bottom Dev. Ctr., (M.D. Tenn. May 28, 2010) (while “under the Medicaid Act, [Clover Bottom \nDevelopmental Center] residents who are eligible for and receive Medicaid assistance from the State have freedom \nof choice to choose among a range of qualified providers” these providers “must be willing to furnish services to the \nrecipient”); see also Rovner v. Keystone Human Servs., 2013 WL 4016490, at *6-7 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 6, 2013) \n(“[P]laintiffs’ suggest that [defendant Medicaid service provider] was obligated to continue rendering waiver \nservices, indefinitely, because [defendant] was, at one time, a willing provider of [plaintiffs’] waiver services. The \nplaintiffs have no legal citation to support this conclusion, which would effectively force providers to remain \n‘willing’ to offer services even if they became, in fact, unwilling to do so. Nothing in the applicable statute, \nregulations, or case law that we have identified supports this assertion.”); Pfaff v. Washington, 2008 WL 2242461, \nat *11 (W.D. Wash. May 29, 2008) (“if a particular provider decides to stop serving a Medicaid recipient, he or she \nis no longer “qualified” or “willing” to “undertake” those services”). \n10 \n \n\nFor the same reasons that intervention by right must be denied, so too must Movants’ \nrequest for permissive intervention, as it is untimely and poses significant risk of undue delay \nand prejudice to the Parties. \niii.  The State’s Capacity to Close GVDC \nAside from Movants’ inability to meet the requirements to intervene under the Federal \nRules, the result they seek – an injunction to enjoin the closing of GVDC – cannot be granted.  \nPrimarily, the Parties, this Court, and the Sixth Circuit understand the closure of this State-run \ninstitution to be within the State’s capacity and an inappropriate question for federal court \nreview.  See United States v. Tenn., 2005 WL 1506480, at *5 n.3 (“We note only in passing that \nthe major objections to the settlement agreement by the Parent-Guardian Association and the \ndistrict court appear to be over the closing of Arlington Developmental Center.  While we \nexpress no opinion about the wisdom or lack thereof of closing Arlington, it is our understanding \nthat the State of Tennessee has the power to close Arlington regardless of a provision to that \neffect in the settlement agreement.”).   \nEvidence of the State’s motivation to pursue reforms in this area was presented to the \nCourt  at  the  fairness  hearing.    While  consistent  with  a  national  movement  towards \ndeinstitutionalization, the plan also allows the State to provide commensurate care at a much \nlower cost.  As counsel for Plaintiff United States explained, the 96 current residents at GVDC \nreceive  care  at  approximately  $1,361  per  day  per  person.    This  cost  can  be  decreased \nsignificantly, allowing the State to offer services to a greater portion of the 7,000 families on the \nwait list to receive care (Transcript of Record, Jan. 21, 2015, at 13:58). \nThe Exit Plan allows residents the choice to continue receiving care at an Intermediate \nCare Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities or to receive waiver services.  While \n11 \n \n\nspecific transition plans for all residents have not yet been developed, counsel for Defendants \nreiterated in the fairness hearing that the transition process would not begin until it could be done \nin compliance with the safeguards memorialized in the Exit Plan.  Defendants emphasized that \n“the State has a track record of being able to close institutions and close them safely, including \npeople  with  severe  medical  conditions.”    (Transcript  of  Record,  Jan.  21,  2015,  at  13:38).  \nFurthermore, as offered by counsel for Intervenor PGACB and PGAGV, closure of GVDC \nthrough the Exit Plan, rather than undertaken unilaterally by the State, allows class members to \nhave input in the process and monitor the State’s compliance (Transcript of Record, Jan. 21, \n2015, at 14:09).    \nThe Court understands Movants’ concerns that “profoundly disabled” residents “face \ngreater  challenges  and  impediments  to  their  health  and  quality  of  life  than  other  disabled \npersons.”  (Docket No. 1121 at 2).  However, residents of the other institutions with similar \nmedical needs have been transitioned to alternative care facilities with largely positive results.  \nAs noted by counsel for Defendants, GVDC houses 81 individuals diagnosed with profound \nintellectual  disabilities.    When  Arlington  Developmental  Center  closed,  there  were  121 \nindividuals with this diagnosis.  Forty-four residents of GVDC require enteral tube feeding, \ncompared to 35 who transitioned from Arlington Developmental Center and 50 who transitioned \nfrom Clover Bottom Developmental Center.  Additionally, Plaintiffs point to a lower mortality \nrate among residents in community services than at GVDC between 2008 and 2014.  (Docket \nNo. 1133 at 10). \n \n \n \n12 \n \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nTo effectively facilitate reform in mental health services, the Court cannot allow “perfect \nto become the enemy of good” nor allow the concepts of federalism and separation of powers to \nbe ignored.  The Court concludes that the Exit Plan presented by the Parties is “fair, reasonable, \nand  adequate”  and  provides  the  next  iteration  of  improvement  to  the  lives  of  those  with \ndisabilities in Tennessee.  It will test political will and legislative leadership to continue that \nprogress and to determine how best to care for those often left in the shadows.   \nFor the reasons detailed above, the Court will grant the unopposed joint motion seeking \napproval of an Exit Plan (Docket No. 1118-1) and entry of a proposed Agreed Order (Docket No. \n1118-2).  The Motion to Intervene brought by conservators of GVDC residents and Citizens for a \nBetter Tennessee (Docket No. 1121) will be denied.  An appropriate Order will enter.   \n \n \n_________________________________________ \n            KEVIN H. SHARP \n            CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n13 \n ",

This  motion  is  the  culmination  of  intense \nnegotiations between the Parties, Plaintiffs United States of America (the “United States”),  \nPeople First of Tennessee, Inc. (“People First”), and Intervenors Parent Guardian Association of \nClover Bottom Developmental Center (“PGACB”) and Parent Guardian Association of Green \nValley Developmental Center (“PGAGV”), and Defendants, the State of Tennessee, et al.   \nAlso pending is a Motion to Intervene filed by a group of conservators for family \nmembers residing at the State’s last remaining institution, Green Valley Developmental Center \n(“GVDC”)  (Brian  Bragdon,  Lisa  Hill,  Gail  King,  Ricky  Lingerfelt,  Gena  Wexler,  Russell  \nWexler,  Leonard  Wyrick  Jr.)  and  a  nonprofit  organization  Citizens  for  a  Better  Tennessee \n(collectively “Movants”) (Docket No. 1121).  For the following reasons, the Court will approve  \nthe Exit Plan and enter the Agreed Order. The Motion to Intervene will be denied. \n \n1 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 1 of 13 PageID #: 6177 \n\nI.  Facts \nOn May 7, 2014, the Court ordered the Parties to participate in a settlement conference in \norder to reach resolution in this litigation, which has spanned twenty years (Docket No. 1101).  \nOver the course of many conferences with Magistrate Judge Griffin, the Parties drafted an Exit \nPlan, which “sets forth objective and measurable exit criteria that, together with the proposed \nAgreed Order, provide for the dismissal of this action with prejudice upon the State’s satisfaction \nof those criteria.” (Docket No. 1118 at 2).    \nThe terms of the Exit Plan, to be completed in two phases concluding June 30, 2016,1 are \nset forth in detail in the proposed Agreed Order (Docket No. 1118-2).  They include, inter alia, \nimplementation of revised Individual Support Plans and Quality Assurance tools, and further \ntraining for staff of Independent Support Coordination Agencies, case managers, residential and \nday services providers, and law enforcement.2  The Exit Plan further provides for refinements to \nthe  use  of  psychotropic  medications  for  individuals  with  intellectual  or  developmental \ndisabilities, including Family Training, examination of authorization criteria for reimbursement \nof  psychotropic  medications  by  the  TennCare  Pharmacy  Advisory  Committee,  and \nstandardization  of  the  referral  process  to  regional  Psychopharmacology  Review  teams.3    It  \nprovides for the establishment of behavior respite services and behavioral crisis prevention,4 and \neducation and enrollment of class members in SelectCommunity.5  Finally, the Exit Plan notes \n                                                            \n1  The Exit Plan  provides that “any failure to complete an obligation  required to be completed by a date prior to  June  \n30, 2016 shall not  be  deemed  to constitute a failure to satisfy a material provision of this Exit Plan so long as the \nobligation is satisfied on  or  before June 30, 2017.”   (Docket No. 1118-1 at  2-3).  \n \n2  Id. at §§ III,  VI. \n \n3 Id. at § IV. \n \n4 Id. at § V.  \n \n5 Id. at § VII.  \n2 \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 2 of 13 PageID #: 6178 \n\nthe State’s revision of the Freedom of Choice Form setting forth the rights of persons choosing to \nreceive care at an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities.6    \nAfter entry of the proposed Agreed Order, the State will announce the closure of GVDC \nand prepare Individual Support Transition Plans for all class members residing there.7  This final \nsection prompted the Motion to Intervene from Movants, who strongly contest the cessation of \nservices at the institution (Docket No. 1121).  Though all residents of GVDC are class members  \nrepresented by Plaintiff People First of Tennessee, Movants seek to carve out a second class \ncomprised of “all profoundly disabled persons receiving care or programs from the defendants” \nor, alternatively, “all profoundly disabled persons residing now or in the past five years at GVDC \nand  their  conservators.”  (Id.  at  17).    They  request  the  Court  “[i]ssue  a  preliminary  and \npermanent injunction order under Rule 65, F.  R.  CIV.  P. to enjoin the closing of GVDC and to  \nrequire adequate resources, staffing and care for profoundly disabled persons” and “declaratory \njudgment that the present level of resources, staffing and care for profoundly disabled persons in \nTennessee violates their constitutional rights under the 5th and 14th Amendments, federal and \nstate laws.”  (Docket No. 1121-2 at 20).  This motion will be treated further in the analysis  \nbelow. \nII.  Analysis \nA.   The Proposed Exit Plan and Agreed Order \nPrior to approving a proposed settlement in a class action, the district court must find a \nsettlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  FED.  R.  CIV.  P. 23(e)(2).  It must also conduct a \nfairness hearing, which acts as an additional “procedural safeguard” for the parties to “proffer \n                                                            \n6  Id. at §  VIII.  \n \n7 Id. at § X.  \n3 \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 3 of 13 PageID #: 6179 \n\nsufficient  evidence  to  allow  the  district  court  to  review  the  terms  and  legitimacy  of  the \nsettlement.”  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace, and Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. \nGen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 635 (6th Cir. 2007) (hereinafter “UAW”).  Throughout this \ninquiry, the district court retains “wide latitude” to limit the information presented by the parties \n“to whatever is necessary to aid it in reaching an informed, just and reasoned decision.”  Id. \n(quoting Tenn. Ass’n. of Health Maint. Orgs. v. Grier, 262 F.3d 559, 567 (6th Cir. 2001)). \nCourts in the Sixth Circuit look to several factors to determine whether a proposed \nsettlement agreement meets the requirements of Rule 23(e)(2): “(1) the risk of fraud or collusion; \n(2) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the amount of discovery \nengaged in by the parties; (4) the likelihood of success on the merits; (5) the opinions of class \ncounsel and class representatives; (6) the reaction of absent class members; and (7) the public \ninterest.”  UAW, 497 F.3d at 631.  District courts engaging in this assessment “enjoy[] wide \ndiscretion in assessing the weight and applicability of these factors.  Todd v. Retail Concepts,  \nInc., 2008 WL 3981593, at *4 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 22, 2008) (citing Granada Invs., Inc. v. DWG \nCorp., 962 F.2d 1203, 1205-06 (6th Cir. 1992)).   \n“The fairness of each settlement turns in large part on the bona fides of the parties’ legal  \ndispute.”  UAW, 497 F.3d at 631.  The Court’s task is not to decide which Party’s argument is  \nstronger, as this would “defeat the purpose of a settlement in order to approve a settlement.”  Id. \nat 632.  “The question rather is whether the parties are using settlement to resolve a legitimate \nlegal and factual disagreement.”  Id.  A review of the procedural history of this long-running \ndispute, and of the Exit Plan and Agreed Order, leads the Court to conclude the Parties’ proposed \nsettlement is fair and appropriate.  The factors below are particularly instructive.  \n4 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 4 of 13 PageID #: 6180 \n\n  First, no evidence of fraud or collusion has been presented, nor is any suggested.  See Se. \nMilk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL  2155379, at *4 (E.D. Tenn. May 17, 2013) (“Courts respect the \nintegrity of counsel and presume the absence of fraud or collusion in negotiating the settlement, \nunless evidence to the contrary is offered.”) (quoting In re Packaged Ice Antitrust Litig., 2011  \nWL 6209188, at *14 (E.D. Mich. July 13, 2006) (internal citations omitted)).  Both Parties are \nrepresented  by  experienced  counsel  and  settlement  negotiations  have  been  overseen  by \nMagistrate Judge Griffin.  Furthermore, experienced class members have also played an active \nrole in drafting the Exit Plan and Agreed Order. \n  Second, the Court is mindful that “‘[m]ost class actions are inherently complex and \nsettlement avoids the costs, delays, and a multitude of other problems associated with them.’”   \nSe. Milk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL 2155379, at *4 (quoting In re Telectronics Pacing Sys. Inc., \n137 F. Supp. 2d 985, 1013 (S.D. Ohio 2001)).  In the event the Exit Plan is not approved, the \nspecter of further litigation looms large.  Defendants have reserved the right to abandon the  \nsettlement plan if the Court does not enter the Agreed Order by January 31, 2015 (Docket No. \n1118-1 at 2).  Thus, if this step forward is unsuccessful, the Parties will very likely be launched \nmany steps back. \n  As for the likelihood of success on the merits, at the fairness hearing, counsel for Plaintiff \nPeople  First  of  Tennessee  highlighted  aspects  of  the  settlement  that  would  have  been \nunattainable through litigation, specifically establishment of a Quality Review Panel to oversee \nclosure of GVDC, a detailed framework for training of Independent Support Coordinators, and \nthe strengthening of mental health intervention services to avert behavioral crises.  Thus, it \nappears collaboration has fostered what may be a more positive result for Plaintiffs than would \nbe achievable even through successful litigation (Transcript of Record, Jan. 21, 2015 at 13:52).  \n5 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 5 of 13 PageID #: 6181 \n\nAs noted by counsel for Plaintiff United States, the Exit Plan brings to fruition the promise of the  \nsettlement agreement and goes farther than the Court could require.  \n  This also makes clear that the Exit Plan has the support of class counsel and class  \nrepresentatives.  “The judgment of experienced counsel and class representatives regarding the \nsettlement should be given significant weight.”  Se. Milk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL 2155379, at \n*5.  “Their collective judgment that the settlement is in the best interest of class members weighs \nheavily in favor of the Court’s final approval of the Agreement.”  Id.  While Movants have \nvoiced strong dissent to one section, the Exit Plan is largely supported and the product of long, \nhard  collaboration  between  the  Parties.   See  Todd,  2008  WL  3981593,  at  *  5  (approving \nsettlement where “[b]oth sides are represented by able and experienced class counsel who hold \nthe opinion that the Settlement Agreement should receive final approval.”) \n  Finally, the proposed settlement benefits the public interest.  See UAW, 497 F.3d at 632 \n(noting the “federal policy favoring settlement in class actions” when approving the proposed \nsettlement between a labor union and auto manufacturer); Se. Milk Antitrust Litig., 2013 WL \n2155379,  at  *7  (“[T]here  is  a  public  interest  in  settlement  of  disputed  cases  that  require \nsubstantial federal judicial resources to supervise and resolve.”).  The terms of the Exit Plan are a \nroadmap for the most recent reforms in a deinstitutionalization effort that began decades ago.   \nThe Supreme Court of the United States played a hand in this movement when, in Olmstead v. \nL.C. ex rel. Zimring, it recognized “unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities  \nis a form of discrimination” that “perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated \nare incapable or unworthy of participating in community life” and “severely diminishes the  \neveryday life activities of individuals.”  527 U.S. 581, 600-05 (1999) (balancing this concern \nwith the State’s role as administrator of services for people with mental disabilities, the Court \n6 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 6 of 13 PageID #: 6182 \n\nalso noted that States must have “leeway” to “maintain a range of facilities and to administer \nservices.”).  \n  For these reasons, the Court concludes the settlement agreement meets the requirements \nof Rule 23(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The Exit Plan will be approved and the \nproposed Agreed Order entered. \nB.     The Motion to Intervene \n    Mindful of these public interest benefits, the Court turns to the Motion to Intervene.  \nMovants seek to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) and for \npermissive intervention under Rule 24(b).  They request the Court enjoin closure of GVDC and \nprovide  for  sufficient  resources  to  care  for  profoundly  disabled  residents.    While  deeply \nempathetic to Movants’ concerns, the Court concludes this motion must be denied, as it fails to \nsatisfy the elements for intervention and would require the Court act in a matter reserved to the  \ndiscretion of the State. \n  Each of the conservators is the family member of a profoundly disabled person who has \nresided at CVDG for over thirty years.  Through many affidavits, Movants shared personal \nstories of the exceptional care their family members received at GVDC and fears for the physical \nhealth and emotional wellbeing of residents who would be moved from the place they considered \nhome. \n  In response to these concerns, counsel for the Parties explained the detailed transfer plan \ncreated to ensure residents’ smooth transition, the wide array of alternative equivalent care \noptions available, and the motivation for reform  of the prior institutionalization framework with  \nclosure of the last remaining State institution.     \n \n7 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 7 of 13 PageID #: 6183 \n\ni.   Intervention by Right \n  In the Sixth Circuit, “proposed intervenors must meet four criteria before intervention by \nright is permitted: (1) the application for intervention must be timely; (2) the applicant must have \na substantial, legal interest in the subject matter of the pending litigation; (3) the applicant’s  \nability to protect that interest must be impaired; and (4) the present parties do not adequately  \nrepresent the applicant’s interest. The proposed intervenor must prove each of the four factors; \nfailure to meet one of the criteria will require that the motion to intervene be denied.”  Grubbs v. \nNorris, 870 F.2d 343, 345 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing Triax Co. v. TRW Inc., 724 F.2d 1224, 1227 \n(6th Cir. 1984)). Here, Movants fail to meet the first element. \n  When considering whether an application for intervention is timely, courts consider five \nfactors  in  the  context  of  all  relevant  circumstances:  “(1)  the  point  to  which  the  suit  has  \nprogressed; (2) the purpose for which intervention is sought; (3) the length of time preceding the  \napplication during which the proposed intervenor knew or reasonably should have known of his \ninterest in the case; (4) the prejudice to the original parties due to the proposed intervenor’s \nfailure, after he or she knew or reasonably should have known of his or her interest in the case, to \napply  promptly  for  intervention;  and  (5)  the  existence  of  unusual  circumstances  militating  \nagainst or in favor of intervention.”  Id. at 345-46. \n  Movants’ motion was filed on January 17, 2015, four days before the scheduled fairness \nhearing.  Movants argue the “first and only notice that the closing of GVDC was an issue” was \nJanuary 6, 2015, when the Parties filed the joint motion seeking approval of the Exit Plan and \nentry of the proposed Agreed Order (Docket No. 1121-1 at 3).  However, as early as 1996, \nPlaintiff People First of Tennessee, on behalf of its class members (including all residents of \nGVDC), sought development of “community living arrangements for all members of the plaintiff \n8 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 8 of 13 PageID #: 6184 \n\nclass  for  whom  such  living  arrangements  are  called  for”  as  well  as  “community  services \nnecessary to provide class members with minimally adequate habilitation.”  (Docket No. 48 at  \n80).  The Settlement Agreement reached in 1999 also sought to provide class members the “least \nseparate, most integrated setting appropriate to meet his or her individual needs.”  (Docket No. \n327 at 3).  Since the commencement of this litigation and related disputes, the three other State-\nrun institutions have closed. \nIn light of this background and procedural history, the Court agrees with Defendants that  \na consistent goal of this action has been “to move class members into community based homes \nand out of the congregate institutional environment.”  (Docket No. 1123 at 6).  Thus, Movants \nshould have reasonably known closure of GVDC might be a concern from very early in the \ncourse of this litigation and could not have learned of it first when the Parties filed the joint \nmotion to approve the Exit Plan and enter the Agreed Order.  \n  Furthermore, the Parties – including class members who have already moved out of \nGVDC  and  the  other  now-closed  institutions  –  would  be  significantly  prejudiced  should \nMovants’ request be granted and litigation continue, as they stand to benefit from the increased \ntraining for care providers and other institutional reforms provided for in the Exit Plan.  Those \nclass members, it should be noted, have largely successfully transitioned to alternative programs.   \n  Because Movants fail the first element required to intervene as of right under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), the motion must be denied.   \nThe Court adds that even if the Motion to Intervene were timely, Movants still cannot \nsatisfy the remaining elements for intervention by right.  Movants have not shown a legally \nprotectable interest in the provision of the Exit Plan that concerns closure of CVDG.  The  \nParties, the Tennessee Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and \n9 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 9 of 13 PageID #: 6185 \n\nMedicaid  Services  (CMS),8  and  case  law  within  the  Sixth  Circuit  and  other  jurisdictions9  \nuniformly support the assertion that the power to close GVDC rests with the State.  Nor have \nMovants shown their interests are unrepresented.  As noted by Plaintiffs, “[t]he fact that the \nPGAs agreed to compromise does not mean that they did not share and vigorously advocate the \nmovants’ interests.” (Document No. 1133 at 3).             \nii.   Permissive Intervention  \n“To intervene permissively, a proposed intervenor must establish that the motion for \nintervention is timely and alleges at least one common question of law or fact.”  United States v. \nMichigan, 424 F.3d 438, 445 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Michigan State AFL–CIO v. Miller, 103 \nF.3d 1240, 1248 (6th Cir. 1997)).  “Once these two requirements are established, the district \ncourt must then balance undue delay and prejudice to the original parties, if any, and any other \nrelevant factors to determine whether, in the court’s discretion, intervention should be allowed.”  \nId. \n                                                            \n8  As noted in  Plaintiffs’ “Response in Opposition to Brian Bragdon et al.’s Supplemental Memorandum of Law on  \nTimeliness, Class Action, and Lack of Fairness in Proposed Final  Order” (Docket No. 1133  at  4),  “the PGAs  have \nadvocated since the earliest days of this litigation that parents and guardians should  be allowed to choose a \ncontinued stay at the institutions” which led the State of  Tennessee to submit an inquiry to CMS regarding  whether \nthe Social Security Act required Tennessee to allow a Medicaid beneficiary “to  remain in a state institution even \nthough the state had decided that the person should be served elsewhere.”  (Id.).  The CMS confirmed “the Social \nSecurity Act did  not  require an  unwilling  provider … to continue to  provide services that it had  determined were \ninappropriate.”  (Id., see Docket No. 749, Exh. B).  \n  \n9  See e.g., United States v.  Tenn.,  2005 WL 1506480,  at  *5 n.3 (6th  Cir.  June 23, 2005),  People First of Tenn. v.  \nClover Bottom Dev. Ctr., (M.D. Tenn. May 28, 2010) (while “under the  Medicaid Act,  [Clover Bottom  \nDevelopmental Center] residents who are eligible  for and  receive Medicaid assistance from  the State have freedom  \nof choice to choose among a range of qualified  providers” these providers “must be  willing to  furnish services to the \nrecipient”);  see also  Rovner v.  Keystone Human  Servs., 2013 WL 4016490, at *6-7 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 6, 2013) \n(“[P]laintiffs’ suggest that [defendant Medicaid service provider] was obligated to  continue rendering  waiver \nservices, indefinitely, because [defendant] was, at one time, a willing provider of [plaintiffs’] waiver services. The \nplaintiffs have  no legal citation to support this conclusion, which  would effectively force providers to remain  \n‘willing’ to offer services even if they became, in fact, unwilling to do  so. Nothing in the applicable statute, \nregulations, or  case law that we have identified supports this assertion.”);  Pfaff v.  Washington, 2008  WL 2242461,  \nat *11 (W.D. Wash. May  29, 2008) (“if a particular provider decides to stop serving a Medicaid recipient,  he or she  \nis no longer “qualified”  or “willing” to “undertake” those services”). \n10 \n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 10 of 13 PageID #: 6186 \n\nFor the same reasons that intervention by right must be denied, so too must Movants’ \nrequest for permissive intervention, as it is untimely and poses significant risk of undue delay \nand prejudice to the Parties. \niii.   The State’s Capacity to Close GVDC \nAside from Movants’ inability to meet the requirements to intervene under the Federal \nRules, the result they seek – an injunction to enjoin the closing of GVDC – cannot be granted.  \nPrimarily, the Parties, this Court, and the Sixth  Circuit understand the closure of this State-run \ninstitution to be within the State’s capacity and an inappropriate question for federal court \nreview.  See United States v. Tenn., 2005 WL 1506480, at *5 n.3 (“We note only in passing that \nthe major objections to the settlement agreement by the Parent-Guardian Association and the \ndistrict court appear to be over the closing of Arlington Developmental Center.  While we \nexpress no opinion about the wisdom or lack thereof of closing Arlington, it is our understanding \nthat the State of Tennessee has the power to close Arlington regardless of a provision to that \neffect in the settlement agreement.”).    \nEvidence of the State’s motivation to pursue reforms in this area was presented to the \nCourt  at  the  fairness  hearing.  While  consistent  with  a  national  movement  towards \ndeinstitutionalization, the plan also allows the State to provide commensurate care at a much  \nlower cost.  As counsel for Plaintiff United States explained, the 96 current residents at GVDC \nreceive  care  at  approximately  $1,361  per  day  per  person.    This  cost  can  be  decreased \nsignificantly, allowing the State to offer services to a greater portion of the 7,000 families on the \nwait list to receive care (Transcript of Record, Jan. 21, 2015, at 13:58).  \nThe Exit Plan allows residents the choice to continue receiving care at an Intermediate  \nCare Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities or to receive waiver services.  While \n11 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 11 of 13 PageID #: 6187 \n\nspecific transition plans for all residents have not yet been developed, counsel for Defendants  \nreiterated in the fairness hearing that the transition process would not begin until it could be done \nin compliance with the safeguards memorialized in the Exit Plan.  Defendants emphasized that \n“the State has a track record of being able to close institutions and close them safely, including \npeople  with  severe  medical  conditions.”    (Transcript  of  Record,  Jan.  21,  2015,  at  13:38).  \nFurthermore, as offered by counsel for Intervenor PGACB and PGAGV, closure of GVDC \nthrough the Exit Plan, rather than undertaken unilaterally by the State, allows class members to \nhave input in the process and monitor the State’s compliance (Transcript of Record, Jan. 21, \n2015, at 14:09). \nThe Court understands Movants’ concerns that “profoundly disabled” residents “face  \ngreater  challenges  and  impediments  to  their  health  and  quality  of  life  than  other  disabled \npersons.”  (Docket No. 1121 at 2).  However, residents of the other institutions with similar \nmedical needs have been transitioned to alternative care facilities with largely positive results.   \nAs noted by counsel for Defendants, GVDC houses 81 individuals diagnosed with profound \nintellectual  disabilities.    When  Arlington  Developmental  Center  closed,  there  were  121 \nindividuals with this diagnosis.  Forty-four residents of GVDC require enteral tube feeding, \ncompared to 35 who transitioned from Arlington Developmental Center and 50 who transitioned \nfrom Clover Bottom Developmental Center.  Additionally, Plaintiffs point to a lower mortality  \nrate among residents in community services than at GVDC between 2008 and 2014.  (Docket \nNo. 1133 at 10). \n \n \n \n12 \n\n \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 1136   Filed 01/29/15   Page 12 of 13 PageID #: 6188 \n\nIII.  Conclusion \nTo effectively facilitate reform in mental health services, the Court cannot allow “perfect \nto become the enemy of good” nor allow the concepts of federalism and separation of powers to \nbe ignored.  The Court concludes that the Exit Plan presented by the Parties is “fair, reasonable, \nand  adequate”  and  provides  the  next  iteration   of  improvement  to  the  lives  of  those  with  \ndisabilities in Tennessee.  It will test political  will and legislative leadership to continue that  \nprogress and to determine how best to care for those often left  in the shadows.   \nFor the reasons detailed above, the Court will grant the unopposed joint motion seeking \napproval of an Exit Plan (Docket No. 1118-1) and entry of a proposed Agreed Order (Docket No. \n1118-2).  The Motion to Intervene brought by conservators of GVDC residents and Citizens for a \nBetter Tennessee (Docket No. 1121) will be denied.  An appropriate Order will enter.   \n \n \n_________________________________________ \n            KEVIN H.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE \nNASHVILLE DIVISION \nPEOPLE FIRST OF TENNESSEE,  ) \neta/.,  ) \n) \nPlaintiffs,  ) \n) \n~  )  No. 3-95-1227 \n)  JUDGE ECHOLS \nCLOVER BOTTOM DEVELOPMENTAL  )  (cons. w/ 3:96-1 056) \nCENTER, eta/.,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nAGREED ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION \nFOR PARTIAL TERMINATION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nDefendants have submitted a Motion pursuant to Section X.B.l2 of the Settlement \nAgreement requesting partial termination of the Settlement Agreement with respect to Nat T. \nWinston and Greene Valley Developmental Centers.  Because the State closed the Nat T. \nWinston Developmental Center and will not re-open it, the Court previously issued an Order \ngranting the Motion to dismiss the Nat T. Winston Center. \nPresently pending before the Court is the State's Motion for partial termination of the \nSettlement Agreement with respect to institutional conditions at Greene Valley Developmental \nCenter on the basis that defendants have demonstrated the achievement and maintenance of \nsubstantial compliance with sections VI., Institutional Care and Services and VII., Protection \nfrom Harm of the Settlement Agreement.  Following informal and formal expert reviews, the \nUnited States and the Parent Guardian Association have indicated that they have no opposition to \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 770   Filed 03/16/06   Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 1009\n\nthe State's Motion.  People First, however, has opposed the State's motion.  This matter is set for \ntrial on March 28, 2006. \nPeople First and the State defendants have engaged in extensive discovery concerning the \nissues raised by the Motion.  Subsequently, they engaged in fully informed settlement \ndiscussions in an effort to resolve the issues presented by the Motion and these discussions have \nbeen successful.  It appears to the Court that People First and the State defendants have met and \nagreed that this Motion should be granted based on the agreed terms and conditions. \nFor good cause shown, it is therefore ORDERED that Defendants' Motion for partial \ntermination of the Settlement Agreement with respect to institutional conditions at Greene \nValley Developmental Center on the basis that defendants have demonstrated the achievement \nand maintenance of substantial compliance with sections VI., Institutional Care and Services and \nVII., Protection from Harm of the Settlement Agreement is hereby GRANTED.  In addition, \nwhile the Court retains jurisdiction in this matter, the following terms and conditions shall apply: \nI.  All current Greene Valley Developmental Center residents shall remain Class \nMembers and shall retain all their rights as Class Members pursuant to section I., \nII., III., IV., V., VIII., IX., X. of the Settlement Agreement; \n2.  The State will maintain services to Greene Valley Developmental Center \nresidents at a constitutional level as required by law.  In an effort to maximize the \nnumber of Class Members who choose to live in the community, the State will \nmake Class Members, their families and/or Conservators and the public aware of \ngood community residential (both Waiver and ICF/MR) and day programs and \noffer education to Class Members, their families and/or Conservators about real, \n2 \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 770   Filed 03/16/06   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 1010\n\nmeaningful choices concerning all the available existing options for services in \nthe community as well as community services that can be developed.  Defendants \nwill provide this information and outreach such that Class Members, their \nfamilies and/or Conservators are made aware of the full range of choices and \noptions for services available to them and are encouraged to use them; and \n3.  Starting in fiscal year 2007-2008, the State will develop sixteen four-person \nICF/MR homes in the geographic area served by Greene Valley Developmental \nCenter.  These JCF/MR homes will be developed at the rate of at least four homes \nper year and will be operated by the State beginning in fiscal year 2007-2008. \nThese homes will be integrated into neighborhood residential settings and will be \navailable first for Class Members currently residing at Greene Valley \nDevelopmental Center. The State will assure the development of community \noptions (whether waiver or community JCF/MR) to meet the needs of Class \nMembers transitioning from Greene Valley Developmental Center.  The State \nagrees to identifY a suitable community placement and to transition as soon as \nreasonably practical (I) any Class Member residing at Greene Valley \nDevelopmental Center who chooses to move to the community as well as (2) any \nClass Member residing at Greene Valley Developmental Center who (a) through \nthe exercise of reasoned professional judgment has been selected for community \nplacement, (b) has been involuntarily discharged, and (c) the order of involuntary \ndischarge has become final. \n3 \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 770   Filed 03/16/06   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 1011\n\nIt is so ORDERED. \nif_~ \nEntered this  o+2006. \nR~~ \nU.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE \nAPPROVED FOR ENTRY: \nIs Jack W.

This Settlement Agreement is entered into by People\nFirst of Tennessee, the United States of America  (\"Plaintiffs\"),\nand the State of Tennessee  (\"State Defendants\").  The Plaintiff,\nPeople First of Tennessee, asserts a class consisting of all\npersons who presently reside or will reside at Clover Bottom\nDevelopmental Center  (including the Harold Jordan Center), Greene\nValley Developmental Center or Nat T. Winston Developmental\nCenter, and all persons who have resided there at any time since\nDecember 22, 1992.  The parties agree to the certification of\nthis class.  This Settlement Agreement sets forth provisions for\nrestructuring and enhancing Tennessee's state-wide system for the\ndelivery of services to citizens who reside or have resided as of\nDecember 1992, or who will reside in the State's three regional\ndevelopmental centers:  Clover Bottom Developmental Center\n(including the Harold Jordan Center), Nashville; Greene Valley\nDevelopmental Center, Greenville; and Nat T. Winston\nDevelopmental Center, Bolivar, Tennessee  (hereinafter\n\"citizens\").  The State Defendants hereby agree to take the\nfollowing actions to guarantee protection of the federal\nstatutory and constitutional rights of these citizens.\nB.  This Agreement draws upon the initial settlement\nagreement proposed by People First of Tennessee and the remedial\nplans developed and activities undertaken by State Defendants,\nincluding the Tennessee Quality Initiative  (\"TQI\"), and\n\nrepresents a consensus of the parties as to the most appropriate\nmeans of providing services to Tennessee citizens with\ndevelopmental disabilities.\nC.  This Agreement, voluntarily entered into by the parties,\nshall be enforceable as an order of the Court by the parties and\nany member of the class approved by the Court.  This Agreement is\nlegally binding on and judicially enforceable by the parties as\nprovided herein and it shall be applicable to and binding upon\nall of the parties, their officers, agents, employees, assigns\nand successors.  This Agreement may not be used as evidence of\nliability in any other civil proceeding and is enforceable only\nby the parties.\nII•  Preamble and Guiding Principles\nThe parties enter into this Settlement Agreement recognizing\nthat their overriding common interest is in assuring that\nTennessee's citizens with developmental disabilities are provided\nreasonable opportunities to grow and develop, exercise\nindependence, and lead full and productive lives in a safe\nenvironment.  This Agreement requires the restructuring and\nenhancement of Tennessee's state-wide delivery of services to\nthese citizens in a way that recognizes the individuality of each\ncitizen and understands the critical role of family members,\nguardians, and others who provide support and care.  The\nfollowing guiding principles are intended only to be used to aid\nin the interpretation of the operative provisions of the\nAgreement, and are not intended to function as independently\n- 2 -\n\nenforceable standards for meeting the terms of this Agreement.\nToward these ends, the parties acknowledge the following guiding\nprinciples.\nA.  Each citizen must be provided services in the least\nseparate, most integrated setting appropriate to meet his or her\nindividual needs.\nB.  All decisions regarding services for citizens must be\nperson-centered, driven by the individual citizens, family\nmembers, guardians, advocates, and other interested persons, and\nmade on an individualized basis by appropriate interdisciplinary\nteams of competent and qualified professionals with input from\nthose persons.\nC.  Tennessee's programs and services must be designed to\nprovide all citizens the reasonable opportunity to grow, develop,\nexercise independence, and to live full and productive lives.\nD.  Tennessee recognizes the need to provide services to\neach citizen in his or her home communities and to provide a\nbroad array of living environments and services, including homes\nadapted to individual needs, health care and therapy, work at\nregular, meaningful, and compensated employment, opportunities to\ndevelop relationships with family, friends, neighbors,\nco-workers, helpers and support staff and community\norganizations, and participation in community activities.\nE.  All citizens must direct their own lives and be enabled\nto make meaningful choices about matters that are important to\nthe person.  Decisions about services and supports for each\n- 3 -\n\ncitizen shall be made by the citizen with the support of parents,\nguardians, friends and advocates.\nF.  All programs developed pursuant to this Agreement shall\nbe fully adequate to meet the needs of citizens served by them.\nNo citizen shall be placed in a program which does not fully meet\nhis or her needs and fully protect his or her health and\nwell-being.\nG.  All citizens must be provided with adequate and\nappropriate health care services and such specialized health care\nservices as may be needed to ensure their health and well-being.\nH.  All citizens must be protected from harm and\nunreasonable risks of harm and be protected from unnecessary\nphysical and chemical restraint.\nI.  Each child covered by this Agreement must be provided a\nfree, appropriate public school education in the least\nrestrictive, most integrated setting appropriate to his or her\nneeds in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1485.  From the date of filing\nthis Agreement, no child shall be removed from the regular\neducational environment as long as the child's education can\nsatisfactorily be achieved in a regular class with supplementary\naids, services and support.\nJ.  All citizens, their families, guardians,\ncare-givers and support personnel must be educated about their\nrights and responsibilities, and how to exercise them.  All\ncitizens shall be allowed to exercise their constitutional\n- 4 -\n\nrights.  In addition, all of these individuals must be provided\ncurrent information about all available resources and programs,\nand how to access them.\nK.  The quality of supports and services, consumer\nsatisfaction, and the prevention of abuse and neglect is best\nassured by educated and involved citizens, family members, and\nother individuals who provide supports and services for the\ncitizens.\nL.  State Defendants agree that a system of accountability,\nquality assurance and monitoring necessary to implement this\nAgreement, including quality control systems with internal\nmonitoring; case management, investigations and data collection,\nare essential to maintaining quality and obtaining favorable\noutcomes.\nM.  Implementation of this Agreement will be most successful\nif there is good communication and collaboration among citizens,\nfamilies, advocates, guardians, private service providers and\ngovernment.\nN.  Resources and expertise now lacking at Tennessee's\ninstitutions need to be developed on an expedited basis to ensure\nthat the rights of citizens are protected.\n0.  Each citizen will have a reasonable opportunity to\nchoose from appropriate service providers, his or her living\nenvironments, his or her roommates, and his or her qualified\nsupport staff.\n- 5 -\n\nP.  In the event a community placement is inappropriate for\na citizen, the State will provide an appropriate alternative\nplacement and service system to meet the citizen's needs.\nIll.  State Planning, Implementation and Oversight\nA.  The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation  (DMHMR) will continue to implement the statewide\ninitiative embodied in the TQI.  The Director of the TQI shall be\na state employee.  Within the structure of TQI, one individual\nwill be assigned to coordinate statewide activity in each of the\nfollowing content areas:  Monitoring and Evaluation; Protection\nfrom Harm; Medical Care; Physical and Nutritional Management;\nBehavior Intervention; Habilitation; Physical Environment;\nCommunity Placement; Investigations of Alleged Abuse, Serious\nAccidents and Injuries, and Other Alleged Staff Misconduct; and\nEducational Services for School Age Children.\nB.  There will be a TQI Coordinator at each developmental\ncenter and at each regional Office of Community Services.  The\nState Defendants shall assure that the central office of DMHMR\nand its regional Offices of Community Services  (OCS) are\nsufficiently staffed to meet the requirements of this Agreement.\nTo that end, within 30 days of filing this Agreement with the\nCourt, the State Defendants shall conduct a needs assessment and\ndevelop a plan for the assignment and/or acquisition of staff for\nthe central and regional offices to meet the requirements of this\nAgreement.\n- 6 -\n\nC.  The TQI Director will be responsible for coordinating\nand monitoring compliance with all provisions of this Agreement\nand will identify variance within the system for timely\ncorrection.\nD.  State Defendants shall identify staff at the central and\nregional offices who will have responsibility for providing\ninformation about implementation of this Agreement and for\nresponding to questions and communications from citizens,\nfamilies and guardians.  State Defendants shall publicize the\nnames, office telephone numbers and responsibilities of these\npersons to all citizens, their families and guardians, and to all\nappropriate public agencies and private organizations and their\npersonnel.  State Defendants shall coordinate their information\nand public relations activities at the central and regional level\nwith the DMHMR Office of Public Information and Education  (OPIE).\nE.  State Defendants shall employ within one year of the\nsigning of this Agreement, a well qualified and experienced\ndevelopmental medicine physician to 1) exercise clinical\nsupervision of the developmental center physicians,\n2) participate in the selection, evaluation, and retention of\nmedical specialists and other physicians, 3) provide ongoing\nin-service and individual consultation to the developmental\ncenter physicians and community physicians, and 4) participate in\nthe transition planning for all citizens returning to the\ncommunity from the developmental centers.  This individual will\n- 7 -\n\nbe different from the person identified in paragraph IIIA above\nwho is responsible for Health Care under TQI.\nF.  State Defendants agree to make all reasonable efforts to\npursue all sources of available federal and state funding to\nsupport the execution of their responsibilities under this\nAgreement.  In selecting among alternatives that meet 1) the\nrequirements of this Agreement, 2) the requirements of federal\nstatutes, and 3) the professional judgment standard for\nconstitutionally appropriate levels of care, it is agreed that it\nis appropriate for the State Defendants to consider the\navailability of resources, the cost-effectiveness of various\nprogrammatic and service options, e.g. the State's Home and\nCommunity-Based Waiver under Medicaid, and the overall burden on\nthe State's budget.\nG.  The DMHMR will work with colleges, universities and\nUniversity Affiliated Programs  (UAPs) in the State of Tennessee\nto facilitate the -establishment of courses of instruction and\ncurricula designed to develop a pool of paraprofessionals and\nprofessionals with skills needed to provide effective services to\ncitizens.\nH.  State Defendants shall collect data, and maintain\nrecords and recordkeeping systems adequate and appropriate to\neffectuate the terms of this Agreement.  In this regard, State\nDefendants shall design and implement a statewide system for\ntracking outcomes for citizens in the service system, as well as\nother statewide data collection systems provided for herein.\n- 8 -\n\nIV.  Evaluations and Assessment\nA.  Person-Centered Evaluations of Individual Citizens\n1.  Each individual citizen must receive a\ncomprehensive person-centered evaluation of all of his or her\nindividual medical, behavioral, habilitation and treatment needs,\nby competent professionals who are members of the IDT.  Each\ncitizen who is not recommended for community placement by the IDT.\nmust also receive an evaluation for community placement conducted\nby professionals independent of the Department of Mental Health\nand Mental Retardation who are agreed upon by the parties.\nCollectively, these evaluations will form the basis for each\ncitizen's Individualized plans, including Individual Support and\nTransition Plans  (described herein at Section V.A.) and the\nhealth care and behavioral support plans that supplement the\nIndividual Support and Transition Plans.\n2.  These person-centered assessments must be\ncomprehensive and must analyze what is important to the citizen,\nhis or her vision of the future, and his or her medical,\nbehavioral, vocational, social and spiritual needs.  They must\ndraw upon communications with the individual being evaluated and\nfamily members or guardians, discussions with friends, support\nstaff, and professionals familiar with the individual, the known\nmedical, behavioral and social histories of the individual, and,\nwhen appropriate, evaluations from expert consultants.  All\nassessments made pursuant to this section shall be based upon the\nindividual needs and choices of the citizen and not on present\n- 9 -\n\navailability of services.  Any member of the IDT may make\nadditional recommendations for necessary services for the citizen\nand such additional recommendation(s) shall be submitted to the\nQuality Review Panel  (as defined in Section X.A. below).  The IDT\nmay state its reasons for declining the recommendation(s).  In\nsuch instances, the Administrator of the institution shall be\ninformed of any necessary treatment decisions.\nB.  Assessment of Existing Services and Supports\n1.  State Defendants must make a comprehensive\nassessment of the services and supports needed by all citizens\nand a companion analysis of resources presently available in the\ncommunity to meet these needs.  This analysis shall form the\nbasis of the Community Development Plan  (as discussed in V.C.)\nfor expanding or developing the full range of needed services.\nV.  Development of Plans. Services and Supports\nA.  Development of Individual Support and Transition Plans\n1.  Each citizen will have a person-centered  Individual\nSupport Plan (ISP) and, if appropriate, an Individual Transition\nPlan  (ITP)  (collectively referred to as Individual Support and\nTransition Plans  (ISTPs)).  An Individual Support Plan is the\ndocument that reflects the person's vision of a desired life.\nEach ISP shall be based on an individual assessment and include a\ndescription of the person's current life, functioning, a\nstatement of the outcomes necessary to achieve the person's\ndesired life, and a description of the actions, supports and\nservices required and the persons and providers responsible for\n- 10 -\n\nachieving the desired outcomes.  These plans will be developed by-\nteams consisting of the individual citizen, family members,\nguardians, knowledgeable support staff, advocates and appropriate\nprofessionals, including professionals with expertise in\ndeveloping and implementing such plans, as well as any person\nrequested by the citizen.  The State Defendants shall make\nreasonable accommodation(s) to include all such persons and must\nactively seek the input of these persons.  The ISP will focus on\nthe individual's needs, reflecting the value of supporting the\nperson with relationships, productive work, participation in\ncommunity life, personal decision-making, and training to become\nas self-sufficient as possible.  When significant changes occur\nin a citizen's life situation, corresponding changes shall be\nmade in the citizen's supports and services and shall be\nreflected in the ISTP.\n2.  The planning process will result in a written plan\ncontaining a detailed description of the identity, location,\nfrequency and duration of the services and supports needed by the\nindividual.  Each citizen will choose his or her community\nservice providers from available and qualified community service\nproviders.  The process will be coordinated by an Independent\nSupport Coordinator  (case manager).\n3.  Each citizen and his or her parent(s) or legal\nguardian(s) shall participate in the development of the\nIndividual Support and Transition Plans (\"ISTPs\") as members of\nthe IDT.  As members of the interdisciplinary team, and as\n- 11 -\n\nimportant participants, the input of citizens and parents or\nguardians shall be encouraged and respected by the other members\nof the team.\n4.  Each citizen and his or her parent(s) or legal\nguardian(s) shall be informed of the recommendations of the\nindependent evaluation and the IDT, including all feasible\nalternatives to the provision of services in a developmental\ncenter.  Each citizen and his or her parent(s) or legal\nguardian(s) shall be informed of their freedom of choice\nregarding participation in the Medicaid home and community-based\nwaiver.  The State Defendants shall ensure that this freedom of\nchoice is offered and honored as required by federal Medicaid\nregulations.  The State Defendants shall ensure that the citizens\nare provided services that meet the citizens' individual needs as\nset out in the ISTP.\n5.  State Defendants will ensure that citizens are\nplaced in an appropriate and safe manner and that placements in\nthe community are adequate to meet the needs of the individuals\nas presented in their ISTP.  The nature of an individual's\ndisability will not be a factor in the eligibility of that\nindividual for community placement consideration.  No citizen\nwill be placed in a nursing home or board and care home unless\napproved by the Quality Review Panel and agreed to by the\nparties.\n6.  Each ISTP shall specify in detail the services and\nsupports needed, including at home, in day activities or work and\n- 12 -\n\nthe specialized medical services, to serve the individual citizen\nin the community.  All services and supports shall be integrated\ninto the community to the maximum extent possible to implement\neffectively the ISTP.  Transition services, such as home visits\nand overnights, as well as any other steps that need to be taken\nto ensure an orderly and smooth transition for the citizen, must\nalso be included in the ISTP.  All staff involved in the\ntransition process must be familiar with the individual who is\nmoving.\n7.  Pre-service training for community staff must\ninclude:  (a) First aid, CPR and the Heimlich maneuver;\n(b) general fire safety and evacuation;  (c) incident reporting;\n(d) training specific to the needs of the individual.

No citizen who is medically or\nbehaviorally at risk shall live in a residence unless at least\none staff person is on duty who is trained in first aid, CPR and\nthe Heimlich maneuver.\n8.  For school age children, the ISTP shall also\ninclude a statement of the educational program, including related\nservices and transportation services, to be provided each child.\nNo child shall move to the community without an agreed-upon\n- 13 -\n\nIndividual Education Program  (IEP).  Placement notice consistent\nwith the applicable state policy and procedure manual shall be\nobtained.  The State Defendants must ensure that the placement is\ncapable of providing the educational services required by the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-\n1485 and the citizen's IEP and must coordinate such placement\nwith the local educational agency.  Educational services to\ncitizens must comply with all applicable federal and Tennessee\nstate laws with regard to special educational services to\ndisabled children.  All placements of children in residential\nsettings must also comply with all applicable Tennessee state\nlaws with -regard to special educational services to disabled\nchildren.  All children should live with families.\n9.  State Defendants shall ensure that the community\nplacement for each and every citizen meets the individual needs\nof the citizen, as identified in the ISTP.  Under no\ncircumstances will the speed or type of a placement be governed\nby anything other than the interests of the citizen being placed.\nState Defendants may use existing community program vacancies\nonly where they have determined that the program meets the needs\nof the citizen as identified in the ISTP.  State Defendants shall\ncreate or contract for a community program that meets the needs\nof the citizen as identified in the ISTP.\n10.  The provision of community services and supports\nto citizens shall be informed/guided by the scope of services\nprovisions and the funding allocations set out in the State's\n- 14 -\n\nHome and Community-Based Waiver under Medicaid which shall be\nwritten to support the execution of the State Defendants'\nresponsibilities under this Agreement.  The scope of services\nprovisions and funding allocations under the Waiver shall not\napply where the community services and supports required by an\nindividual citizen under this Agreement cannot be met through the\nWaiver, where compliance with this Agreement can be achieved by\npursuing other sources of federal funding, or in the event that\nsubstantial modifications in the federal Medicaid program\nsignificantly change the terms of the Waiver.\n11.  For each citizen at the developmental centers, an\nindividualized transition profile will be developed by the IDT.\nThe transition profiles will contain at least the following\nelements:  1) citizen's name, age, and sex; 2) communication\nability/method/primary language; 3) diagnoses; 4) intellectual\nlevel and adaptive behavior level; 5) mobility; 6) hearing/vision\nacuity and dental status; 7) mealtime patterns and nutritional\nstatus; 8) type and frequency of supervision; 9) environmental\nadaptations/security needs; 10) general health condition and\nchronic and emergency health care needs; 11) preferred number and\ncharacteristics of housemates; 11) preferred geographic location;\n12) a description of the person's important relationships and the\nname, location and frequency of contact of family and significant\nothers; 13) anticipated adjustment issues; (14) supports and\nservices needed for the individual's safety; (15) the person's\nvision for the future; (16) a description of the individual's\n- 15 -\n\npersonality, skills and interests; 17) the \"non-negotiables\" for\nthe person, that is, the things that person must have to be happy\nand that, if not available, would result in obvious distress;\n18) the person's spiritual and religious preferences; 19) the\nperson's support needs; and 20) the person's vocational\ninterests.\n12.  The ISTP and the Independent Support Coordinator's\n(ISC) placement certification for each citizen will be filed with\nthe Quality Review Panel.  The Quality Review Panel will review\neach individual placement prior to such placement occurring.  The\nPanel shall complete its review and report to the IDT within\ntwenty  (20) days of receiving the ISTP and certification from the\nIDT unless the Panel requests additional time for a particular\nplacement.  The Panel's review will include review of relevant\nsupporting documentation and issues raised by members of the IDT.\nSuch reviews shall determine the adequacy of the placement and\nensure that the placement meets the individual needs of each\ncitizen.  Where the Panel determines that there are major\ndeficiencies with a placement, the placement shall not occur\nuntil all the identified major deficiencies are corrected.  Any\nother deficiencies shall be corrected in a timely manner.\n13.  Community placements shall provide a safe and\nhumane environment in which individuals are provided daily\nopportunities to learn, develop and maintain skills.

State Defendants shall develop a support\ncoordination system sufficient to ensure that the needs of each\ncitizen placed in a community-based program pursuant to this\nAgreement are consistently reviewed and met.  A description of\nthis system shall be provided to the parties within thirty (30)\ndays of the filing of this Agreement with the Court.  Each\ncitizen shall have an Independent Support Coordinator.\n- 17 -\n\nIndependent Support Coordination will be provided by individuals\nor organizations who are independent of the provision of direct\nservice.  No individual Support Coordinator may provide services\nto more than 3 0 persons.  If a citizen requests a different\nSupport Coordinator, State Defendants will take all reasonable\nmeasures to meet that request.\n4.

If\nthe citizen and/or the parent(s) or guardian(s) believes that the\ncommunity placement or service is not meeting the citizen's needs\nduring this period, then they may request that the State\nDefendants timely provide a choice of alternative placements or\nservices.  The State Defendants will immediately respond to such\na request in accordance with the provisions of Section V.B.ll of\nthis Agreement.  If, at the end of this six-month period, the\ncommunity placement continues to meet the individual needs of the\ncitizen, then the State Defendants will cease holding the\ndevelopmental center bed.  All community placements shall be made\nin accordance with applicable federal law and regulations.  The\ncitizen and/or the parent(s)/guardian(s) shall have all the due\nprocess and fair hearing rights provided for therein.\n11.

Monitoring and Enforcement\nA.  Quality Review Panel\n1.  The Quality Review Panel  (Review Panel or Panel)\nshall be constituted by three individuals mutually agreed upon by\nthe parties with recognized expertise in the field of\ndevelopmental disabilities, transitional and community services.\nTwo members will work part-time.  The third member will Chair the\nPanel and will work full-time in that position for at least the\nfirst two years following the Court's entry of this Agreement.\nFor selection of the members of the Panel, each party may submit\na list of three names with their respective resumes.  The parties\nshall consult on all of the names submitted and agree upon the\nthree members for the Panel.  If the parties are unable to agree,\nthe Court  (Magistrate Judge) shall select a panel of experts from\n- 53 -\n\nthe persons nominated by the parties.  If any of the Panel\nmembers are unable to continue to serve, his or her replacement\nshall be selected in the same manner as described above.\n2.  The purpose of this Panel is to assist in the\nimplementation of this Agreement.  The Panel will have two\nprimary functions:  i) to review placement decisions and\nplanning; and ii) to assist in monitoring the implementation of\nthis Agreement.  It is intended that the Panel will pursue a\nproblem-solving approach so that litigation and disagreements can\nbe minimized and the energies of all interested persons can be\nfocused on the task of meeting the needs of the citizens and\nachieving the outcomes required by this Agreement.  To these\nends, the Review Panel shall develop a set of policies and\nprocedures consistent with this Agreement and professional\nstandards, within 3 0 days of the seating of the Panel, in\nconjunction with the parties and subject to their agreement.\nThese policies and procedures shall be documented in writing and\ndistributed to all parties and the Court  (Magistrate Judge).  The\nReview Panel may modify these policies and procedures, including\nthe methodologies for reviews discussed below, as appropriate to\nmeet the requirements of different stages of the implementation\nof this Agreement.  Any party may recommend such modifications to\nthe Review Panel.  All modifications of these policies and\nprocedures must be made in writing and are subject to the\nparties' agreement.  Any disputes concerning these policies and\nprocedures that cannot be resolved shall be addressed first\n- 54 -\n\nthrough mediation conference with Court/Magistrate Judge with\nnotice to all parties.\n3.  The Panel will operate as follows:\na.  The Panel will meet at least quarterly to\ncarry out its responsibilities as outlined in X.A.2. and shall\nmeet at such other times as it deems appropriate.  The State\nagrees to provide the Review Panel with sufficient resources to\nperform its functions under this Agreement, including resources\nto employ experts and staff.  Within 45 days of the appointment\nof the full Review Panel, the Panel shall submit an annual budget\nto the State for review and approval, and, thereafter, shall\nsubmit a budget on an annual basis two months prior to the\nbeginning of the proposed funding period.  This budget will show\nthe resource needs and costs associated with planned activities\nof the Review Panel for the coming year.  This budget should\nprovide sufficient detail such that proposed amounts for spending\nand resource allocation by area of activity are set out.  These\nplanned activities will be consistent with the responsibilities\nand duties of the Review Panel as described in this Agreement.\nThe State and the Review Panel shall agree on methods for\nclear documentation and accountability regarding Review Panel\nexpenditures including procedures for ensuring that Review Panel\nmembers receive timely compensation from the State.  Review Panel\nmembers shall receive appropriate and timely compensation from\nthe State Defendants and shall be promptly reimbursed by State\nDefendants for services and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses\n- 55 -\n\nincurred in performing their duties.  Reimbursement rates for\nout-of-pocket expenses, including travel, shall be consistent\nwith existing State regulations.  The annual cost of the\nactivities of the Review Panel will not exceed a cap of $550,000\nwithout an approved modification.  In the event that\nunanticipated circumstances give rise to the need for budget\nmodifications during the year, the Review Panel shall submit to\nthe State requests for modifications of its annual budget.\nBudget modifications include substantial changes or increases in\nspending and resource allocations in the existing budget as well\nas expenses that will exceed the annual cap amount.  Total\nrequests for modification shall not exceed 20% of the annual\nbudget amount.  The State also agrees to provide the Panel with\nadditional $50,000 of \"in-kind\" services and support  (copying,\nphones, office materials and space) annually.  If the State and\nthe Review Panel are unable to resolve budget and related issues,\nthey will pursue resolution through mediation conference with the\nCourt  (Magistrate Judge) with notice to all parties.  If the\nReview Panel feels that its ability to perform its duties is\nbeing constrained by the State's actions concerning budget and\nrelated issues, then the Review Panel may seek immediate review\nand relief through the mediation process herein described with\nthe Court  (Magistrate Judge) with notice to all parties.\nb.  The State agrees that the duties of the TQI\nCoordinator at each developmental center shall include assisting\nthe Review Panel in the performance of its functions.  If this\n- 56 -\n\narrangement proves to be insufficient, the State and the Review\nPanel shall determine a mutually agreeable alternative for\nproviding the services of an ombudsperson at each developmental\ncenter.\nc.  Consistent with section V.A.9 of this\nAgreement, the ISTP and Independent Support Coordinator's\nplacement certification for each citizen will be filed with the\nPanel.  The Panel will review each individual placement prior to\nsuch placement occurring.  The Panel shall complete its reviews\nand report to the IDT within twenty  (20) days of receiving the\nISTP and certification from the IDT, unless the Panel requests\nadditional., time for a particular placement.  The Panel's review\nwill include review of relevant supporting documentation and\nissues raised by members of the IDT.  Such reviews shall\ndetermine the adequacy of the placement and ensure that the\nplacement meets the individual needs of each citizen.  Where the\nPanel determines that there are major deficiencies with a\nplacement, the placement shall not occur until all the identified\nmajor deficiencies are corrected.  Any other deficiencies shall\nbe corrected in a timely manner.\nFor the first six months following the seating of the Panel,\nsuch reviews will be conducted by all three members of the Panel,\nbut thereafter such reviews may be conducted only by the Chair,\nconsulting as the Chair deems appropriate with the other members\nof the Panel.  Reviews shall be reduced to writing in any case\nwhere deficiencies are identified and such deficiencies shall be\n- 57 -\n\nspecified with particularity.  State Defendants shall correct\nsuch deficiencies in a timely manner.\nd.  The Panel will assist in monitoring compliance\nwith this Agreement.  System reviews of the quality of all\nservices and supports provided to the citizens in each of the\ndevelopmental centers and in the community shall be conducted by\nthe Panel on an annual basis.  These reviews shall be conducted\nseparately and staggered every six months, with the first review\nof all the institutions occurring within six months of the entry\nof this Agreement and the first review of the community services\nprovided to each citizen occurring six months thereafter.\nWithin two months of the seating of the Review Panel, the\nPanel shall develop, in conjunction with the Parties and subject\nto their agreement, a written, professionally-based, evaluation\nmethodology to be used for their annual system reviews of the\nquality of all services and supports provided to citizens in the\ndevelopmental centers and in the community.  This methodology\nshall include at least the following items:  1) the number and\ntype of experts the Panel anticipates will assist in evaluating\ncompliance; 2) the sampling approach and data collection methods;\n3) the approach and procedures for site visits, site visit\npreparation, and on-site data collection; 4) the anticipated\nnumber of days and types of activities conducted on-site to\nevaluate compliance; 5) the anticipated types of documents that\nwill be reviewed; and 6) methods for measuring and assessing\ncompliance and progress with this Agreement.  The State shall\n- 58 -\n\nhave this methodology for at least four months before the Review\nPanel conducts the initial review of either the institutions or\nthe community.  This methodology is intended to give a framework\nfor the Panel's reviews, but shall in no way operate to amend,\nalter or otherwise displace the requirements of this Agreement.\nThe Review Panel may modify their methodology.  The provisions\nset out above in Section X.A.2. regarding modifications of the\nPanel's policies and procedures shall apply to modifications of\nthe review methodology.\nIn conducting their reviews, the Review Panel shall work\ncooperatively with the State and, to the extent possible, notify\nthe State of their observations and conclusions as reviews take\nplace.  The Review Panel shall submit to the parties and to the\nCourt a written report for each review that details their\nmethodology, findings and recommendations.  The focus of these\nreports shall be on compliance with this Agreement, but the\nreports shall also contain appraisals of the progress made by\nState Defendants during the review period.  The State shall\nensure that all deficiencies are remedied promptly.  The parties\nmay wish to discuss these reports within the context of the\nprovisions of scheduled quarterly status conferences with the\nCourt.  If disputes arise as to the scope, findings, or\nrecommendations of these reports, the parties shall make every\neffort to resolve these informally.  Any disputes that cannot be\nresolved shall be addressed through the processes described in\nsection B.I. of this section, below.\n- 59 -\n\ne.  There shall be no ex parte communications between\nthe Review Panel and the Court.  Ex parte communications among\nthe Review Panel and the parties are permitted.\nf.  In the event that the State has concerns about\nwhether the activities of the Review Panel are unreasonable or\ninconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and is unable to\nresolve these concerns informally with the Review Panel, the\nState shall seek to address these concerns through mediation\nconference with the Court/Magistrate Judge with notice to all\nparties.\nB.  Reporting and Enforcement\n1.  If any party believes that State Defendants are\nfailing to comply with this Agreement, or with any part thereof,\nthe party must confer with State Defendants in a good faith\neffort to attempt to reach an agreement regarding corrections of\nany of the alleged deficiencies prior to bringing an enforcement\naction.  If the parties are unable to agree, any party shall\nrequest a mediation conference with the Magistrate Judge assigned\nto this case.  This requirement is subject, however, to the\nfollowing emergency exception.  Any party may bring an action for\nimmediate injunctive relief if the party believes that there\nexists an imminent or continuing risk of serious harm to any\ncitizen that is not being addressed appropriately by State\nDefendants.\n2.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a party\nfrom ultimately seeking redress with the Court in the event that\n- 60 -\n\nefforts at conciliation and mediation are unsuccessful.  If\nmediation or further injunctive relief prove unsuccessful, a\nparty may seek additional relief from the Court.\n3.  The parties shall hold quarterly status conferences\nwith the Magistrate Judge assigned to this case to review State\nDefendants' compliance with the Schedule of Implementation,\nincorporated as Attachment A to this Agreement.\n4.  State Defendants shall provide to the parties and\nthe Panel copies of the TQI internal and external peer review\nreports, and any annual surveys, including the surveys of the\ncommunity-based programs and facilities referenced in V.D.I.\nState Defendants shall provide to the parties and the Panel on a\nmonthly basis:  primary documentation regarding deaths  (including\ndeath certificates, death summaries, discharge papers,\ninvestigative reports, and preliminary and completed autopsies);\nstatistical summaries of incidents and injuries; relevant summary\ninformation on hospitalizations and code blues; summaries of\nrestraint usage; completed abuse and neglect investigation\nreports and documentation of any disciplinary or follow-up\nactions taken.  State Defendants shall immediately notify the\nparties and the Panel of any deaths or allegations of serious\nabuse or neglect involving serious injuries or incidents.\n5.  The Panel, the parties to this Agreement and their\nattorneys, consultants and agents shall have reasonable access to\nall information, records, buildings and areas, including those of\nproviders, and shall be permitted to interview any citizen,\n- 61 -\n\nemployee of State Defendants or of any provider, at reasonable\ntimes and places.  The Panel and the parties are not required to\ngive State Defendants advance notice of their intent to visit any\nfacility.  State Defendants may seek relief from the Court in the\nevent that State Defendants believe the Panel or any party's\nmonitoring activities are unreasonable or inconsistent with this\nSettlement Agreement.\n6.  State Defendants shall bear all costs related to\ncopying or otherwise supplying the parties or the Review Panel\nwith documents requested by the parties or the Panel that relate\nto the State Defendants' compliance with this Agreement.  The\nidentities-of citizens shall be kept confidential, and neither\nthe names nor likenesses of citizens shall be publicized without\ntheir permission except that the parties may refer to a citizen\nby the citizen's first name and last initial.\n7.  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude any party\nfrom conducting additional discovery pursuant to the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, such as, but not limited to,\ndepositions or requests for admissions, on matters relating to\nenforcement or compliance with the Agreement.  State Defendants\nmay seek relief from the Court in the event that State Defendants\nbelieve a party's discovery activities are unreasonable or\ninconsistent with this Settlement Agreement.\n8.  Retaliation against any individual, employee,\nfamily member or citizen based on communication with the Panel or\nany party or party representative is strictly prohibited.  A\n- 62 -\n\nnotice to this effect must be posted in all locations where\ncitizens live and employee and public notices are posted.  The\nfalsification of records, data, correspondence or other\ninformation required for determining the State Defendants'\ncompliance with this Agreement is strictly prohibited and will be\na violation of this Agreement, subjecting State Defendants to\ncontempt sanctions by the Court.  A notice to this effect will be\nposted in all locations where employee and public notices are\nposted.\n9.  At least for the first three years following the\nsigning of this Agreement, the Tennessee Comptroller's Office\nshall conduct or shall contract for two annual audits.  The first\naudit will focus on the regional centers and will consist of two\nparts:  an audit of citizen monies and personal property; and an\naudit of the operation of the centers.  The second audit will\nconsist of the same two parts, but will be focused on the\ncommunity placements, including the services and supports.  The\nresults of the two annual audits shall be provided to the Court,\nand the parties.\n10.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction of this action\nfor all purposes under this Agreement until this action is\ndismissed.\n11.  Any party to this Agreement may move to modify,\namend or alter this Agreement at any time after entry of the\nOrder adopting this Agreement.\n- 63 -\n\n12.  After this Agreement has been in effect for at\nleast three years, the State Defendants may petition this Court\nfor termination of this Agreement on grounds that they have\nachieved and demonstrated their ability to maintain compliance\nwith its provisions.  Upon filing of such a petition, the parties\nshall have 90 days within which they may tour and respond.  If no\nresponse is forthcoming, or if the parties agree, then the\nAgreement shall terminate.  If any party does respond, the Review\nPanel thereafter will conduct a review of the compliance issues\nraised by the petition and response(s), and report to the Court\nand the parties on the results of that review.  The Court will\nconduct a hearing as soon as practicable thereafter.  The State\nDefendants will bear the burden of showing that they have\nachieved and demonstrated their ability to maintain compliance\nwith this Agreement.\nAfter this Agreement has been in effect for at least two\nyears, the State Defendants may petition this Court for\ntermination of this Agreement in part.  Such petition for partial\ntermination shall be available only for demonstrating the\nachievement and maintenance of compliance with all of the\nprovisions of Sections VI., Institutional Care and Services, and\nVII, Protection from Harm, with respect to institutional\nconditions at one or more of the three developmental centers\ncovered by this Agreement.

Community Rehabilitation\nAgencies of Tennessee (CMRA) appeals the decisions of the two district courts that denied its petitions to\nintervene as a matter of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). Because CMRA's petitions are\nuntimely and it has not advanced any substantial right to intervene, its appeals are denied.\n591  I. BACKGROUND\n*591\nCMRA is an association of nonprofit agencies that provide services to retarded persons and those with mental\ndisabilities in community placements. These services include case management, residential medical support,\nsupported living, transportation, day services, and other services. CMRA represents the interests of the\ncommunity-based service provider industry in legislative, executive, and judicial matters. CMRA has 75 members,\nincluding most of the community agencies in the State of Tennessee. The vast majority of these community\nagencies is nonprofit, formed in local communities, and receives funding from the State and federal government.\nCMRA appeals the decisions of Judge Robert L. Echols in People First of Tennessee v. Clover Bottom\nDevelopmental Center and Judge Jon P. McCalla in United States v. State of Tennessee, that denied its motions\n[1]\nto intervene in the present litigation.  The two cases have been consolidated for purposes of this appeal. The\nunderlying lawsuits were brought by the United States and private plaintiffs against the State of Tennessee\nregarding the operation of its mental health system. In each case, CMRA alleged in its petition that the State of\nTennessee had violated the constitutional and statutory rights of individuals who are mentally retarded and\ndevelopmentally disabled. It attempted to intervene as of right and permissively in both cases pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and 24(b). CMRA only appeals the decisions that denied them the ability to\nintervene as of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a).\nWe will rely on the ample factual background provided in previous opinions in these two cases to describe the\nevents leading up to CMRA's attempt to intervene. See United States v. State of Tennessee, 181 F.3d 105\n(Table), 1999 WL 357785 (6th Cir.1999); People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., 145 F.3d 1332\n(Table), 1998 WL 246146 (6th Cir.1998); United States v. State of Tennessee, 925 F.Supp. 1292 (W.D.Tenn.\n1995); People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., 878 F.Supp. 97 (W.D.Tenn.1992).\nII. ANALYSIS\nCMRA contends that it was improperly denied the right to intervene in the two cases pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 24(a). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), an outsider may intervene as of right:\nUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action ... when the applicant\nclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the\n\napplicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as practical matter impair or impede\nthe applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately\nrepresented by existing parties.\nThe criteria that must be satisfied before intervention as of right will be granted are: (1) timeliness of the\napplication to intervene, (2) the applicant's substantial legal interest in the case, (3) impairment of the applicant's\n592 ability to protect that interest in the absence of intervention, and (4) inadequate representation of that interest \n*592 by parties already before the court. See Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th\nCir.1997).\nA district court's denial of intervention as of right is reviewed de novo, except for the timeliness element, which is\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1999) (citing Jansen v.\nCity of Cincinnati, 904 F.2d 336, 340 (6th Cir.1990)).\nA.Timeliness\nCMRA contends that now is the appropriate time to intervene and that it filed its motions timely because it learned\nshortly prior to bringing its motions that its interests were not being represented by the existing parties. We have\nidentified several factors to be established in determining whether a request for intervention is timely:\n(1) the point to which the suit has progressed; (2) the purpose for which intervention is sought; (3)\nthe length of time preceding the application during which the proposed intervenor knew or\nreasonably should have known of his interest in the case; (4) the prejudice to the original parties\ndue to the proposed intervenor's failure, after he or she knew or reasonably should have known of\nhis interest in the case, to apply promptly for intervention; and (5) the existence of unusual\ncircumstances militating against or in favor of intervention.\nGrubbs v. Norris, 870 F.2d 343, 345 (6th Cir.1989). \"The determination of whether a motion to intervene is timely\nshould be evaluated in the context of all relevant circumstances.\" Jansen, 904 F.2d at 340. We will find an abuse\nof discretion only when left with the \"definite and firm conviction that the court ... committed a clear error of\njudgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors\" or where it \"improperly applies the\nlaw or uses an erroneous legal standard.\" Huey v. Stine, 230 F.3d 226, 228 (6th Cir.2000) (citations and internal\nquotations omitted).\n1. Stage of the Proceeding\nCMRA contends that the district judges abused their discretion when they denied the motions to intervene. CMRA\nargues it did not become aware of its independent interest to intervene until the implementation of the settlement\nagreements required its members to provide community-based services to individuals without a guarantee of\nsufficient payment by the State of Tennessee. CMRA cites to Grubbs and Linton v. Commissioner, 973 F.2d 1311\n(6th Cir.1992), for the proposition that intervenors can timely appeal during the remedial stages of a consent\ndecree. See Grubbs supra; Linton, supra.\nWe have recently stated that the time of intervention is not the determining factor but rather that \"all\ncircumstances\" must be examined to determine the substantive progress that has occurred in the litigation. See \nStupak-Thrall v. Glickman, 226 F.3d 467, 475 (6th Cir.2000) (\"The propriety of intervention in any given case,\nhowever, must be measured under `all circumstances' of that particular case.\") (citing NAACP v. New York, 413\nU.S. 345, 366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2603, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973)). If the litigation has \"made extensive progress in the\ndistrict court before the appellants moved to intervene\" then this factor weighs against intervention. Id.\nIn these cases, there was very little for either district judge to do when CMRA filed its petitions for intervention. In \nPeople First, Judge Echols had conditionally approved the initial settlement; the parties had prepared the\n593 Community Development Plan required by him. He had approved this plan, and the motion for *593 final approval\nof the settlement was already pending before him. In United States v. Tennessee, Judge McCalla had approved\nseveral remedial orders to bring the mental health system into compliance with the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\n\nPersons Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997) and had approved the Community Plan. All substantive issues had been resolved\nby both judges at the time of CMRA's filing for intervention and all that was required was final approval by the\njudges. This factor weighs strongly against allowing intervention by CMRA. See Stupak-Thrall, 226 F.3d at 475.\n2. Purpose of the Intervention\nCMRA states that it simply requests the opportunity to be an active party in future remedial proceedings. CMRA\nwould like the opportunity to participate in the implementation of the settlement agreements, to advocate and\nprotect the regulatory and economic interests of community providers and to assure that sufficient other\nresources are provided in the community in a timely manner so that individuals receive timely and appropriate\nservices. CMRA contends that throughout the remedial phase the courts and the parties will address matters\nwhich will directly implicate the scope, quality, timing and funding of services to be performed by CMRA\nmembers.\nIn People First, Judge Echols found that this argument did not state an adequate \"purpose for the intervention.\"\nHe stated, \"Because it is the State's responsibility to assure that `resources are provided in the community' and\n`individuals receive timely and appropriate services,' intervention by CMRA would not accomplish these aims.\nFinally, should CMRA hope, through intervention, to obtain higher rates and fewer obligations for community\nproviders, this forum is not the appropriate forum to seek such relief.\"\nIn United States v. State of Tennessee, Judge McCalla held that \"These stated purposes do not rise to the level\nrequiring intervention.\" He held that, \"The State of Tennessee is responsible for ensuring that these interests are\nprotected and CMRA agencies are already participating in the implementation of the Remedial Order by providing\nservices to the class members.\"\nThe interests asserted by CMRA for seeking intervention are not compelling. This factor also weighs against a\nfinding of timely intervention.\n3. The length of time preceding the application during which the\nApplicant knew or should have known of its interest in the case.\nCMRA admits it knew of the litigation in both cases at all stages and it also knew that its members had an interest\nin the outcome of the litigation. It contends that it believed that the existing parties to the two cases adequately\nrepresented its interest initially, and thus, it was not required to intervene in the lawsuits. It now claims that it only\nrecently became apparent that these parties were not adequately representing its interest.\nIn People First, Judge Echols found that CMRA knew of the litigation at all stages and did not attempt to\nintervene when it knew that the interests of the community providers were affected by the litigation and proposed\nsettlement agreement. He stated:\nIt is undisputed that CMRA has been aware of the lawsuits, the time-consuming negotiations\nbetween the parties and interest groups, the disputed issues concerning the types, quality,\n594 location, and accessibility of the proposed community *594 health care services, along with the\ncritical role of the community health care providers in providing these services to the State of\nTennessee for the benefit of the Plaintiffs. Investigations, reports, judicial settlement conferences,\nand hearings have been conducted.\nHe held that this factor weighed against allowing intervention.\nIn United States v. State of Tennessee, Judge McCalla also found that this factor weighed against allowing\nCMRA to intervene. He stated:\nCMRA's interest developed, at the latest date, when the Community Plan was entered, which was\nin 1997. The fiscal crisis of the State and other referenced broken promises of the State do not\n\nchange the fact that CMRA's interests, even broadly construed, were apparent, at the latest date,\nwhen the Community Plan went into effect.\nHe held that CMRA waited too long before intervening.\nWe agree with the decisions of the district courts. An entity that is aware that its interests may be impaired by the\noutcome of the litigation is obligated to seek intervention as soon as it is reasonably apparent that it is entitled to\nintervene. See NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. at 367, 93 S.Ct. at 2604; Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co. v. Tracy, 6 F.3d\n389, 396 (6th Cir.1993); Stotts v. Memphis Fire Dep't, 679 F.2d 579, 584 & n. 3 (6th Cir.1982) (applicants \"should\nhave attempted to intervene when they first became aware of the action, rather than adopting a `wait-and-see'\napproach\"). Given that the settlement agreements specifically address training and the delivery of services in the\ncommunity, \"it would not have required unusual prescience on the part of the intervenors to recognize that their\ninterests were implicated\" when the decree was first proposed. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., 6 F.3d at 396. This\nfactor weighs against timely intervention by CMRA.\n4. Prejudice to the Parties\nCMRA claims that there is no prejudice to the parties because CMRA does not dispute any issues in the present\nsettlement agreements. The district judges concluded that allowing intervention at this late stage of the\nproceeding would add a complicated issue to the litigation. They held that the issues raised by CMRA went\nbeyond the scope of the suit's initial focus on the constitutional issue and statutory rights of developmentally\ndisabled residents of state facilities and would require considerable time and expense unnecessary in light of\nCMRA's access to other fora for resolution of its concern. While CMRA has agreed not to dispute the terms of the\nsettlement agreements, it has not made the same promise as to the remedial plans, the drafting of which involved\nthe participation of more than 2100 stakeholders over many months. There is a risk, to the extent CMRA seeks to\nintervene to discuss reimbursement rates, payment methodologies, or any other items on its list of grievances,\nthat prejudice against the other parties will occur; such attempts may force the parties into collateral litigation over\neconomic issues in cases that have already settled the merits of plaintiffs' claims. See Bradley v. Milliken, 828\nF.2d 1186, 1194 (6th Cir.1987). This factor also weighs against CMRA's intervention.\n5. Unusual Circumstances\nIn People First, CMRA admits that there are no unusual circumstances supporting intervention. In United States\nv. Tennessee CMRA contends there are unusual circumstances because of the pending appeals and active\n595 proceedings concerning compliance with the district court's orders. However, nothing in these *595 proceedings\nhas any effect on CMRA directly. The State of Tennessee, not the CMRA, is ultimately responsible for the funding\nof its mental health system to comply with the United States Constitution, federal statutes, and the courts' orders.\nCMRA has not shown that any of the factors that determine timeliness of intervention weigh in favor of allowing it\nto intervene this late in either lawsuit. Therefore, we are left with a \"definite and firm conviction that the courts ...\ndid not commit a clear error of judgment.\" Huey, 230 F.3d at 228.\nB. Whether CMRA has a substantial legal interest in the subject matter\nof the pending litigation, which may be impaired.\nCMRA claims that it has a substantial interest in this litigation because of its economic interest in how community\nservice programs are funded and because of the lock-in procedure established in the settlement agreements that\naffect how community-based services are provided. We have held, that:\n[I]n this circuit we subscribe to a \"rather expansive notion of the interest sufficient to invoke\nintervention of right.\" Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th Cir.1997). For\nexample, an intervenor need not have the same standing necessary to initiate a lawsuit. See id.; \nPurnell v. City of Akron, 925 F.2d 941, 948 (6th Cir.1991). We have also \"cited with approval\n\ndecisions of other courts `rejecting the notion that Rule 24(a)(2) requires a specific legal or\nequitable interest.'\" Miller, 103 F.3d at 1245 (quoting Purnell, 925 F.2d at 948). \"The inquiry into\nthe substantiality of the claimed interest is necessarily fact specific.\" Id.\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1999). We review the decisions of the district courts de novo to\ndetermine whether they properly held that CMRA did not establish a substantial interest in the litigation. See \nStupak-Thrall, 226 F.3d at 471.\nFirst, CMRA points to its economic interest in assuring adequate funding for implementation of the settlement\nagreements and its contractual rights in agreements with the State to provide community-based services. The\nparties to these lawsuits have entered into consent decrees aimed at guaranteeing that Tennessee provide at\nleast the minimum level of care to developmentally disabled individuals required by federal law. CMRA does not\nchallenge the terms of these agreements or contend that they fall below what federal law requires. CMRA is only\nconcerned with the level of funding provided by the State to community-based service providers. CMRA's\nclaimed interest does not concern the constitutional and statutory violations alleged in the litigation, but rather\nhow much its members get paid for providing services. CMRA has an interest in the economic component of the\nsettlement but the consent decrees obligate the State, not CMRA, to fund community services adequately. By the\nterms of the settlement agreements, it is the responsibility of the State of Tennessee to provide adequate and\nappropriate community services to members of the plaintiff class. Implementation of the settlement agreement\ndoes not alter CMRA's economic interests with the State to provide support and services to the class members\nnor its ability to negotiate the terms of these contracts. Further, as found by both district court judges, CMRA can\nprotect its economic interests in contract negotiations with the State by lobbying the legislative and executive\n596 branches for favorable funding *596 arrangements, and in state courts by suing to enforce its contractual rights.\nSecond, CMRA claims to have a sufficient interest in the litigation because of the lock-in provision in the Provider\nAgreement. The Provider Agreement provision at issue states:\nOnce a Contractor is serving a person on the supported living medical, supported living enhanced\nor supported living behavioral rates, the Contractor must continue to provide services and may not\ndischarge or deny services to that person without permission of the State pursuant to TCA\n33-1-202(c).\nProvider Agreement ¶ E.17. CMRA relies on this court's decision in Linton v. Commissioner of Health and\nEnvironment, 30 F.3d 55 (6th Cir.1994), where we held that intervention was appropriate because individual\nnursing homes had a substantial interest in a suit involving a State plan to remedy violations of the Medicaid Act.\nIn Linton, contracts between the State and nursing homes contained a lock-in provision that prohibited providers\nfrom opting out of the State's Medicaid system until the last patient voluntarily left the nursing home. Id. at\n1315-16. This provision effectively precluded the nursing homes from terminating their membership in Medicaid. \nId. at 1317. We reversed the district court in Linton and held that the effect of the lock-in violated the contractual\nand statutory rights of nursing homes and gave the nursing homes a substantial interest in the litigation to justify\nintervention. Id. at 1315-16, 1319.\nIn People First and the United States v. State of Tennessee, the district judges held that the lock-in provision in\ntheir cases did not have the same effect as in Linton and did not justify a substantial interest in this case to allow\nintervention. First, the agreements in these cases allow the service provider to petition the State to terminate or\nmodify services to the mentally retarded or those with mental disabilities, and thereby do not create a permanent\nobligation as is the case in Linton. Second, the lock-in provision in the cases before us does not establish an\nindefinite obligation on service providers to contract with the State as in Linton. Third, the community-based\nservice providers voluntarily entered into contracts with the State and remain free to renegotiate all aspects of its\ncontracts with the State of Tennessee.\nCMRA's economic interest and its interest in the lock-in provision do not reach the level of requisite substantial\ninterest required to intervene.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\nCMRA has not satisfied the requirements to intervene as of right because it was not timely in bringing its motions\nand did not establish an adequate substantial interest in either lawsuit. Because it has not established these\nnecessary elements, we do not analyze the claims of impairment of the applicant's ability to protect its interest in\nthe absence of intervention, and whether CMRA's interest is inadequately represented by the parties already\nbefore the court. See Michigan State AFL-CIO, 103 F.3d at 1245.\nThe judgments of the district courts are AFFIRMED.\n[*] The Honorable John Feikens, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] In People First, Judge Echols held that CMRA did not timely file its motion to intervene and, even if it had, the\norganization has no substantial interest in the litigation. In United States v. Tennessee, Judge McCalla held that\nCMRA lacked a substantial interest in the litigation, and in the alternative, held that the organization had not\ntimely filed its motion to intervene. For purposes of this appeal this distinction makes little difference.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE \nNASHVILLE DIVISION \nPEOPLE FIRST OF TENNESSEE,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n) \nv.  )  Civil Action No. 3:95-1227 \n)  Judge Echols \nCLOVER BOTTOM  ) \nDEVELOPMENTAL CENTER, et al.  ) \n)  (Cons. w/ 3:96-1 056) \nDefendants,  ) \n~\"hi\"'\" \nII] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS' \nMOTION FOR PARTIAL TERMINATION OF THE SETTLEMENT \nAGREEMENT AS TO HAROLD JORDAN CENTER \nBefore the Court is Defendants' Motion For Partial Termination of Settlement Agreement \nOr, In The Alternative, To ModifY The Settlement Agreement Regarding Harold Jordan Center \n(\"Motion To Terminate\").  [See Dkt. No. 792].  In the Motion To Terminate, the State \ndefendants submit that they have demonstrated the achievement and maintenance of substantial \ncompliance with sections VI (Institution Care and Services) and VII (Protection From Harm) of \nthe Settlement Agreement in regard to the Harold Jordan Center (\"HJC\").1  Following the filing \nof the Motion To Terminate, the United States and People First conducted expert reviews of \nHJC.  In its filing dated March 31, 2008, the United States announced that it does not oppose the \nState's motion for partial termination of the Settlement Agreement as to Harold Jordan Center in \n1 Defendants alternatively moved that a change in factual conditions warranted a modification of the Settlement \nAgreement regarding HJC.  However, as all parties now agree that HJC has demonstrated the achievement and \nmaintenance of substantial compliance with sections VI and VII of the Settlement Agreement, the Court FINDS that \nthe issue of \\'.'hcther factual conditions warrant a modification of the Settlement Agreement is moot. \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 871   Filed 09/30/08   Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 2536\n\n-----------------\n-\n2 \nregard to sections VI and VII.  [See United States' response, pp. 1-2 (Dkt. No. 845)]. PGA a;,·so·  ~ \n·r \natlf  ,., \nfiled a response in which it stated that it did not oppose the State's motion.  [Dkt. No. 8f4]. \nPeople First, however, initially submitted a filing opposing the Motion to Vacate.  [See Dkt. No. \n834].  This matter is set for trial beginning on January 7, 2009. \nSubsequent to the filing of People First's opposition memorandum, People First and the \nState exchanged expert reports in support of their respective positions.  In addition, the State and \nPeople First engaged in settlement negotiations.  Based upon the statements of counsel as \nevidenced by their electronic signature below, it now appears to the Court that People First and \nthe State defendants have met and agreed that the Motion To Terminate should be granted based \nupon the agreed terms and conditions. \nFor good cause shown and as no party now opposes the pending motion, it is therefore \nORDERED that Defendants' Motion To Terminate with respect to conditions at Harold Jordan \nCenter is GRANTED on the basis that defendants have demonstrated the achievement and \nmaintenance of substantial compliance with sections VI (Institution Care and Services) and VII \n(Protection From Harm) of the Settlement Agreement.  In addition, while the Court retains \njurisdiction of this matter, the following terms and conditions shall apply: \nI.  All class members residing at HJC on or before the entry of this Order shall \nremain class members and shall retain all their rights as class members pursuant to \nsections I,!!, !II, IV, V, VIII, IX, and X of the Settlement Agreement.  Persons \nadmitted to HJC after entry of this Order will not be eligible for class membership \nbased solely upon placement at HJC; \n2 The United States did oppose State defendants' alternative argument that a change in factual conditions warranted \na modification ofthe Settlement Agreement regarding HJC, but as explained in footnote 1, this issue is moot. \n2 \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 871   Filed 09/30/08   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 2537\n\n2.  The State will maintain services to class members residing at HJC at a \nconstitutional level as required by law; \n3.  Subject to the exercise of reasoned professional judgment and the requirements \nand restrictions ofT.C.A. §§ 33-5-401, et seq., which apply to any person \ncommitted to HJC under T.C.A. §33-5-403 or transferred to HJC under T.C.A. \n§33-3-30 I, class members living at HJC shall be placed into active transition with \nthe goal of transitioning from HJC to a community placement as soon as \npracticable; \n4.  For each class member resident at and/or transitioning from HJC, the state shall \nprepare a Clinical Risk Assessment for the purpose of assisting with active \ntreatment planning for their ISP, transition planning and placement.  While \nrecognizing that class members transitioning from HJC have not been adjudicated \nguilty of the charges that caused them to be admitted to HJC, the Clinical Risk \nAssessment shall include an assessment of static and dynamic variables that \nimpact the potential for risk and guide planning and programming for treatment at \nHJC and for community placement. \n5.  People First shall be permitted to continue an active chapter at HJC so long as \nthere continues to be a desire by persons living at HJC to participate in the \norganization, which desire HJC staff will not discourage, and as long as that \nparticipation does not interfere with HJC's treatment and care of the residents of \nHJC consistent with their rights under the First Amendment. \n3 \nCase 3:95-cv-01227   Document 871   Filed 09/30/08   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 2538\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nOBERT L.
