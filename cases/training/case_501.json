McCalla finding that the dft's have fully complied with two of the five provisions which were the subject of the Contempt Order of August 24, 1995 (paragraphs 5 and 7 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction have been complied with). The State of Tennessee concedes that it has not complied with paragraph 2 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction, thus only paragraphs 1 (retention of a full-time developmental physician) and 8 (hiring of 136 nurses) are in dispute regarding compliance. For the reasons set forth in order, the dfts remain in contempt as to paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction. The fines as to paragraphs 1,2 and 8 should, therefore, remain in effect until the State of Tennessee achieves compliance. The US is to submit within 30 days of the entry of this order a comprehensive legal analysis of the remedies available for use in this case, including a proposed remedial sanction scheme. The State of Tennessee likewise may, but is not required to, submit its own proposed remedial sanctions scheme and authorities supporting it. Likewise, the intervenor and class representative, People First, and intervenor, Parent-Guardian Association may, but are not required to, submit within 30 days such a proposal. Any party may file a response to the initial filings of those parties submitting proposed remedial sanctions within 15 days of filing by the US. As an interim step, in lieu of the requirement that Commissioner Cardwell spend every fourth weekend at Arlington Developmental Center, four (4) key administators, Medical Director Akers, Superintendent Jackson, Director of Nursing Lester, and Remedial Order Facilitator Hansen, are required to be available one day a month at Arlington Developmental Center for transcribed group and/or individual question and answer sessions. The Monitor may request the presence of additional persons at these sessions. The sessions will focus on implementation not only of the Preliminary Injunctions but also of the Remedial Order and Plan of Correction. The first question and answer session shall be scheduled within three (3) weeks of the date of entry of this order. (cc: all counsel) (TMN) Modified on 11/07/1995 (csf). (Entered: 11/06/1995)"

          "description": "ORDER FOR DISBURSEMENT OF FINE MONIES by Judge Bernice B. Donald representatives of West Tennessee Family Solutions who requested the Court who requested the Court to disburse fine monies in the amounts of $500,000.00 to be used as collateral for leveraging mortgage funds to purchase homes for class members, $108,000.00 to pay the first year's salary for WTFS' executive director; and $30,000.00 to be used to pay a consultant to begin statewide implementation of a mortgage leveraging plan. The parties and the Court monitor have all commented on WTFS' request. Pursuant to the comments of the parties, the Court GRANTS the requests for $500,000.00 and $108,000.00 subject to the terms discussed infra, but DENIES WTFS' request for the $30,000.00. WTFS requestes 500,000.00 to be used as funds to leverage mortgages on homes that would be converted into homes suitable for class members to live in after leaving Arlington Developmental Center. In granting the request, the Court makes it clear that $500,000.00 grant is to be usedsolely for the securing of mortgages for homes that will house class members. The funds shall not under any circumstances, be used to cover operational costs, salaries, or any other expenses incurred by WTFS. The funds shall be placed into a separate, interest-bearing accounts and shall be returned to the Clerk of Court five years from theentry of this Order, along w/ the accumulated interest. In addtion, the funds gratned to WTFS shall be used to secure mortgages on homes for the benefit of class members of this litigation only and shall not be used to benefit any other individuals to who WTFS provides services. WTFS shall quarterly file w/ the Court the bank statement showing the balance of the account containing this $500,000.00, the interest that has accrued, and any transcations depositing or withdrawing funds from the account. Any transactions in or out of the account shall provide good cause for the Court to order full and prompt repayment of the full $500,000.00 w/ accumulated interest prior to the expiration of the 5 year period....... With regard to the grant for $108,000.00 for the first year salary of the executive director, the grant shall apply only to the first year salary of a full-time executive diretor and shall not be used for any other purposes whatsoever. Failure to abide by these terms shall provide good cause to require full and prompt repayment of the full $108,000.00. The monitor recommended to the Court that the Court not provide the grant of $30,000.00 to WTFS to pay for a consultant to begin statewide implementation of the mortgage leveraging program on the gournds that only People First supported the grant while the other parties deferred comment on the grant. The recommendation of the monitor carries great weight w/ the Court, and therefore, the Court DENIES this request. WTFS may reapply for this grant at a later date. Finally the parties shall consult w/ the Monitor to develop a permanent, workable set of criteria for future disbursements of fine monies. The Court monitor shall report to the COurt sixty days from the date of entry of this order on the status of the discussions w/ the parties on the development of these criteria. In conslusion, the Court hereby ORDERS the Clerk of COurt to disburse funds out of the accumulated fines in this case to WTFS in the amount of $500,000.00 and $108,000.00 no later than 5:00 p.m. on July 6, 2001.

Donald re [1488-1] Under the Remedial Order entered on 9/6/94, Dfts are responsible for reimbursing the monitor for all fees and expenses incurred while performing her official duties. Dr. O'Neall retired from the position effective 1/01/01. The current counsel for pla appeared in this action on 9/22 and 10/19/00, respectively. As such, counsel for pla and the Court monitor were new to this long complicated case at the same time. Both consulted w/ the outgoing Monitor on the history of the litigation and the current state of the proceedings. Contrary to the assertion of the Dfts that this briefing was unrelated to the transition duties of the Monitor, Dr. O'Neall was merely fulfilling one of her last duites in aiding the transition between Monitors at an advanced stage in this litigation, not only providing a history of the case but escorting cousel for pla around the gournds of the ADC... The fees appear to be reasonable given the complexity of the history of the case and the amount of time spent in the briefing and in preparation for the briefing. As such, the court overrules Dfts' objection and ORDERES dfts to pay the full 104,640.61 into the registry of the CLerk of COurt by 8/6/01. (cc: all counsel) (PWM) (Entered: 07/30/2001)"

    "summary": "<p>In December of 1990, the United States Department of Justice, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et al, investigated the Arlington Developmental Center (ADC) in Tennessee.  The investigation revealed that conditions in the facility seriously threatened the health and safety of its developmentally delayed residents.  The Department of Justice found that residents were subject to abuse and neglect, inadequate medical care, an unsafe physical environment, and lack of educational services.      </p><p>On January 21, 1992, the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the State of Tennessee pursuant to CRIPA in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, alleging that the state had failed to provide humane conditions and adequate treatment at Arlington Developmental Center.  The case was styled United States v. Tennessee, Civ. No. 92-2062. (W.D.Tenn.1992)(''the United States case\").  </p><p>The case followed a similar action that was filed against the ADC by private plaintiffs, styled People First of Tennessee v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., No. 92-2213  (W.D.Tenn.1992)(''People First case'') (See ID-TN-1 of this collection).</p><p>On August 7, 1992, the District Court (Judge Jon Phipps McCalla) denied the state's motion for summary judgment in the United States case.  U.S. v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp.483 (W.D. Tenn. 1992).  </p><p>A lengthy trial in the United States case began on August 30, 1993 and continued through October 1993.  On November 22, 1993, the Court (Judge McCalla) made issued an oral ruling against the defendants, finding that the conditions at ADC violated the due process rights of the residents.  Written findings of fact were issued by the Court on February 18, 1994.  On September 2, 1994 entered a detailed remedial order to correct the violations the Court found. The order called for the appointment of a monitor.  Linda R. O'Neall, Ph.D. was subsequently appointed to that position.</p><p>On June 30, 1995, Judge McCalla issued an emergency order after the monitor reported that a state of medical emergency existed at the facility.  After the state failed to comply with the emergency order, the court entered a preliminary injunction on July 21, 1995 required the center to hire a Developmental Medicine Physician, additional physicians for overnight coverage, additional nurses, and a full-time psychiatrist.  On August 9, 1995, Judge McCalla found the state in contempt for failure to comply.  In a reported opinion dated November 6, 1995, the court described the state's history of noncompliance in this matter and approved appropriate sanctions.  United States v. Tennessee, 925 F.Supp. 1292 (W.D. Tenn. 1995).  </p><p>On September 27, 1995, the Plaintiffs and the Intervenor in the People First case (ID-TN-1) were named as Intervenors in the United States case.</p><p>Defendants remained in contempt and on June 26, 1996 the court entered a stipulation and order whereby, in lieu of sanctions for contempt, the defendants agreed to develop three comprehensive plans addressing compliance with previous orders, downsizing the facility, and community placement of residents.  </p><p>The court approved the State's proposed community placement plan on August 21, 1997. On June 28, 1999, the court ordered the creation of workgroups to facilitate implementation of the plan but later suspended the workgroups.  The parties appealed the order suspending the workgroups and submitted a mediation settlement agreement.  The District Court (Judge Bernice Bouie Donald) denied a motion to approve the settlement agreement on February 24, 2003. U.S. v. Tennessee, 256 F.Supp. 2d 768 (W.D. Tenn. 2003).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Judge Boyce F. Martin Jr.) vacated and remanded the decision of the district court on June 23, 2005.  United States v. Tennessee, 143 Fed. Appx. 656 (6th Cir. 2005). </p><p>On May 16, 2006, the parties submitted a proposed settlement agreement to resolve various pending matters. The goal of the settlement, reached pursuant to the state's decision to close ADC, was to \"ensure an orderly and careful closure of the ADC, the safe transition of Class Members presently living at ADC to community residences, and the accelerated development of a comprehensive network of services and supports for Class Members as they enter and live in the community.\" The court approved the settlement on Feb. 15, 2007. The settlement set out provisions relating to the transition of class members in light of ADC's closure, including the need for a specific closure plan and transition plan, support resources for families and class members, the development and improvement of community-based services and supports for class members, and improvement of individualized services provided to ADC residents. The settlement also provided for monitoring.</p><p>Over the next several years, litigation continued over the scope and enforcement of the settlement. On January 17, 2013, the court approved a joint exit plan. If the state completed the plan's requirements by the end of 2013, the court would dismiss the case with prejudice. The court dismissed the case and vacated all injunctive relief on December 3, 2013, finding that the state had complied with the exit plan. </p><p>Over the course of the litigation, People First were granted attorney's fees periodically. In total, the court awarded them over $4.4 million. </p><p>The case is now closed.</p>",

The Court includes in this order only those procedural facts that \n  are directly relevant to the instant motion. \n \n2  The precise definition of the Arlington class has been subject to much dispute. See United States v. Tennessee, 143 \n  Fed.Appx. 656, 659–61 (6th Cir.2005). \n \n3  People First’s motion for declaratory relief further asks for a declaration that the State must provide CSN with “full \n  funding,” but People First does not seek summary judgment on this aspect of its motion for declaratory relief, which \nis why People First’s motion requests only partial summary judgment. \n \n4  Properly speaking, there exists a difference between “interpretation” and “construction” of a contract, but this is a \n  fine distinction that Tennessee courts, much like many other courts and authorities, do not observe. See 21 Steven \nW. Feldman, Tenn. Prac.: Contract Law and Practice § 8:2 (2008).

Authorities recognize that Tennessee case law is \nunsettled on this point. See 21 Feldman, supra note 4, § 8:59. There is no need for this Court to decide this legal \ndebate in the context of this case. \n \n8  Counsel for Defendants made this concession orally at the Court’s conference of June 29, 2009. \n \n \n \n \n7 \n ",

Arlington is a\nresidential facility for the mentally retarded operated by the\nTennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.\nThe facility, located in Arlington, Tennessee, was established\nin 1965.  It serves mentally retarded adults and children and\nhas a capacity of 490 beds.  As of April 27, 1990, there were\n470 residents.\nThe information that we have obtained contains allegations\nwhich indicate that residents of Arlington are being subjected to\nconditions that violate their constitutional rights.  The alleged\nunconstitutional conditions include: abuse and neglect of\nresidents; undue use of restraints and isolation; absence of\ntraining programs; unsafe and unsanitary conditions; and undue\nrisk of harm from physical violence and fire hazards.  These\ndeficiencies appear to subject residents at Arlington to\nunreasonable risks to their personal safety and violate their\nconstitutional rights.  See Youncrberq v.

Hickman Ewing,\nJr., who asked us to look into conditions at Arlington because of\nnumerous reported incidents of mistreatment and abuse.  Mr. Ewing\ninformed us that Tennessee State Representative David Shirley had\nrequested his assistance after having received a number of\ncomplaints from parents of residents at Arlington and from past\nand present employees.\nRepresentative Shirley stated that employees are fearful\nthat retaliatory actions will be taken against them.  Based upon\nthat fear, the United States Attorney initially requested that\nT\n\n- 2 -\nwe delay interviewing anyone until a proposed Tennessee\nwhistleblower statute was enacted.  Soon after the statute was\npassed, Mr. Ewing contacted our office to request that we meet\nwith Representative Shirley and several of the Arlington\nemployees and parents.  Interviews were held on April 17, 1990 in\nMemphis, Tennessee. 1/  We also reviewed the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation's (FBI) file that focused, in part, upon physical\nand sexual abuse of residents at Arlington. 2/\nBased upon the information we received from our sources, we\nrecommend an investigation focused on (1) neglect and abuse of\nresidents, (2) misuse of restraints and seclusion, (3) inadequate\nstaff training, (4) health and safety deficiencies, and (5) fire\ncode violations.\nInformation Relating to a Failure to Protect Residents from Harm\nEvery person interviewed reported that a number of the DTs,\nthe direct care staff at Arlington, routinely physically abuse\nresidents.

A decision to initiate an\ninvestigation under CRIPA is based upon a different standard than\na decision to initiate a criminal prosecution.  We note that a\nnumber of the allegations that were brought to our attention by\nthe United States Attorney, Representative Shirley, and the\nwitnesses we interviewed are confirmed by FBI interviews with a\ndifferent set of witnesses.

At least\none employee was apparently fired for reporting abuse. 5/  A\nparent reported that her child had been \"tortured\" after she\nreported abuse and that to protect her son she paid the abuser\nand apologized for having accused him. 6/  This parent and some\n3/ Injuries inflicted by residents upon one another may\nindicate that the level of care and supervision in a facility is\ninadequate: If the injury reports demonstrate that a large number\nof injuries are the result of residents attacking other\nresidents, that may well signify that Arlington is failing to\nprotect its residents from harm as well as failing to provide\ntraining programs.  Such a failure to provide reasonable safety\nin and of itself could constitute a constitutional violation,\neven in the absence of widespread staff abuse of residents.\n4/ FBI Report, memorandum of July 20, 1988 telephone\nconversation with Ms. Conner, supra.\nMs. Franklin's complaint of a retaliatory discharge is\npresently being litigated.  However, it is interesting to note\nthat an internal investigation which approved Ms. Franklin's\ntermination found that:\nWhile we readily acknowledge that abuse can and does\noccur at Arlington, we are satisfied that this is kept\nto a minimum. . . .\nMs. Franklin has made unsubstantiated allegations about\nabuse of residents in Mark Twain II.  While her concern\nfor residents may be genuine, her actions have\nrepudiated this concern.\nFact Finding: Arlington Developmental Center. May 28-29. 1985.\n§y Telephone conversation of April 17, 1990, with the parent\nwho requested confidentiality.  She stated that when she had been\nassured confidentiality in the past it had not been honored and\nher son was later brutalized.  She reported that since her\nmeeting with the Governor she is being watched when she visits\nher son and is often escorted to her car.  Staff confirmed that\nwhen parents report abuse, the abuse gets worse.  Morrell,\nMcMahan, supra.  Additionally, the FBI Report included an\ninterview of March 8, 1989, with Ms. Perkins in which she stated\nthat she did not pursue suspected physical abuse of her daughter\nfor fear that retribution would be taken against her child.\n\n- 4 -\nemployees stated that they had heard that other parents had paid\nDTs not to abuse their children. 7/\nThe following are reported examples of abuse related during\nthe interviews:\nA male resident was found dead on the floor of his\nunit.  A number of employees recounted that a DT\nsprayed him in the face with an aerosol spray in order\nto control him.  They believe that an autopsy was not\nconducted. §J\nIn March 1989, a male resident had his jaw broken in\ntwo places by a DT.  The supervisor who is charged with\nwriting up injury reports requested Arlington's dentist\nto state that he had broken the resident's jaw while\nextracting his wisdom teeth.  The dentist refused to\nwrite such a report. 9/\nOn a number of occasions, DTs placed a female resident\ninto a locked room with high-functioning male residents\n(residents of the Mark Twain Unit) as a disciplinary\nmeasure.  Those residents were directed to beat the\nfemale resident.  They did. 10/  Employees reported\nthat a number of residents have been sent into the\nMark Twain unit for \"disciplinary reasons,\" i.e..\nbeatings. 11/  One parent told Representative Shirley\nthat she feared that her son, who is profoundly mentally\nretarded, would be sent there if she complained. 12/\nAt least two female residents have lost eyes because of\nphysical abuse by DTs.  In one of the injury reports,\nthe resident who is identified as having caused the\ninjury to the other resident's eye is non-violent,\npassive, and apparently not physically or mentally\ncapable of having committed such an assault. 13/\n7/ Franklin, Parent, supra.\nfJ/ Simpson, Morrell, McMahan, supra.\n10/ McMahan, Morrell, supra.\n11/ McMahan, Morrell, Simpson, supra.\n12/ Shirley, supra.\n13/ Simpson, Morrell, supra.\n'T\n\n- 5 -\nA parent recounted that her 11 year old son has\nreceived innumerable bruises and burns at Arlington.\nWhen she questioned a DT about one such bruise, she was\ntold it was a \"birthmark.\"  Another injury, which she\nbelieved was a burn, was explained as having occurred\nwhen her son fell over the table and hit the wall.  Her\nson has been found unconscious twice in the two years\nhe has been at Arlington. 14/  Recently, he was beaten\nwith a paddle by a DT.  The DT was reported as abusing\nthe child after a social worker overheard a supervisor\nand the DT discussing how another resident was to be\nblamed for the assault.  The social worker apparently\nwould not allow the fraudulent report to be written and\nthe DT was, therefore, fired.  However, neither the\nmother nor the Sheriff's office was immediately\nnotified, as policy required, of the abuse. 15/\nSexual abuse is present as well.  Our sources informed us\nthat DTs have sexually assaulted both male and female residents. 16/\nWhen assaults have-been confirmed, the DTs have been transferred\nto other units rather than being fired. 17/  There were reports\nof one female resident having been assaulted by two employees who\ninserted a broom or cane into her rectum. 18/  Additionally,\nthere was a recent report of a sexual assault of a resident by\nanother resident.  Both men had been left unattended during their\nbathtimes. 19/\nAdditionally, there are two deaths not tied to physical\nabuse which merit concern.  In January 1990, a male resident\nchoked to death.  Apparently, sunctioning equipment was either\nnot available or was old, obsolete, and useless. 20/  Another\nmale resident was found, during a visit home, to be running a\nhigh fever.  When his parents brought him to the hospital it was\n14/ Ms. Moore stated that she asked that her son be given a\nbrain scan after each incident.  She was informed that there was\nno need, such tests were only done once a year.\n15/ Moore, McMahan, Rose Flynn, supra.\n16/ Id.\n17/ Morrell, McMahan, supra.\n18/ Simpson, Morrell, Franklin, supra.\n19/ Rose Flynn, supra.\n20/ Simpson, Rose Flynn, supra.\n\n- 6 -\nfound that he had untreated gangrene or peritonitis of the\nintestines.  He died shortly after admission. 21/\nAnother type of abuse involved depriving residents of food.\nOne employee related that residents are punished by either\nwithholding a meal or seconds. 22/  The residents' meals are\nthrown into the garbage in front of them.  Another employee\nconfirmed that residents who have been sent to the infirmary\noften seem to be malnourished. 23/  The above examples of abuse\nand neglect illustrate that Arlington is failing to protect\nresidents from harm and failing to provide staff with training\nadequate to enable them to appropriately attend to the mentally\nretarded residents entrusted to their care.\nInformation Relating to Misuse of Seclusion and Restraints\nWhile Arlington apparently has appropriate policies\nconcerning the use of seclusion and restraints, i.e.. seclusion\nand restraint are to be used only with a physician's approval and\nfor limited periods of time, we were informed that these policies\nare not followed.  Employees recount stories of residents being\nlocked in closets, tied to wheelchairs with sheets and left in\nvacant rooms, and placed in garbage cans. 24/\nA particularly egregious example of the misuse of seclusion\nand restraints concerns a seven year old mentally retarded\nautistic child who, a number of employees stated, has been left,\noften unsupervised, in a locked room for as long as 24 hours at a\ntime.  This room is often bare and at one time was unheated.  It\nsometimes contains a mattress and a few toys.  Some employees\nrelated that the boy has injured himself (knocked out his front\n21/ Parent, supra.  A third death was discussed in the FBI\nReport, supra. interview with Ms. Perkins, an Arlington parent\nand a nurse.  On one of her visits to her daughter, Ms. Perkins\nobserved the medical treatment of an infant with bronchio-\npulmonary displasia.  She noted that the infant was receiving\noxygen that was not being routed through a mixer.  Ms. Perkins\nstated that without a mixer, there was no way of controlling the\noxygen percentage being furnished to the child.  She also\nobserved that the infant was not hooked to an oximeter, which\nmeasures the percentage of oxygen actually saturating a patient's\nbloodstream.  The infant died a few months later.  A nurse told\nMs. Perkins that the baby had died as a result of disconnecting\nherself from the oxygen supply.\n22/ Franklin, supra.\n23/ Mrs. Flynn, supra.\n24/ Franklin, Flynn, McMahan, supra.\n\n- 7 -\nteeth) by hitting his face and head against the bare floor or the\nsink.  The child wears a helmet at all times, and sometimes his\nhands have been swathed in bandages in order that he not injure\nhimself.  He has, at times, chewed and mangled his shoulder to\nthe extent that it \"looks like hamburger meat.\"  The employees\nrelated that he is sent to the room because he is difficult to\nlook after and demands a lot of attention.  He screams when\nplaced in the room and quiets down when he is permitted out. 25/\nOne nurse who became particularly interested in his case and\ncomplained to her superiors concerning his treatment has been\nforbidden to see him except when she is providing him with\n\"nursing services.\" 26/\nInformation Relating to Health and Safety Deficiencies\nEmployees and parents reported a number of apparent health\nviolations, i.e.. shortages of toothbrushes, razors, soap,\ndisinfectant.  Apparently, prior to State audits such items\nappear; however, they are not replenished and are often simply\nput away until the next audit. 27/  A DT reported shaving as many\nas 18 men for one week with the same razor. 28/  Often the same\ntoothbrush and bathwater are used for a number, if not all,\nresidents in the unit. 29/  A number of residents have been\nidentified as Hepatitis carriers, which increases the health\nrisks to the population when personal items are shared.\nThere appears to be a general lack of supervision which\ncreates a safety risk for some of the residents. 30/  Our sources\nreport that residents are often uncared for and left unattended,\n25/ McMahan, Morrell, Flynn, Parent, supra.  Ms. McMahan also\nprovided us with informal notes that she has taken, often\ncontemporaneously, confirming the events related.\n26/ Disciplinary Action, dated 2/6/90, of Frances McMahan.\n27/ Parent, Franklin, Simpson, McMahan's notes, supra.\n28/ Simpson, supra.\n29/ Morrell, McMahan's notes, supra.\n30/  Our sources reported that, on certain shifts, there are\nstaff shortages of both nurses and DTs.  Additionally, a number\nof the staff are reputed to drink or take drugs while on duty and\nhave allegedly engaged in sexual misconduct.  Parent, Simpson,\nMcMahan, Franklin, Rose Flynn, supra.\n\n- 8 -\nsometimes naked, while the DTs watch TV. 31/  One employee\nreported seeing a resident, who was left unattended at the\ncanteen for more than 20 minutes, eating from a garbage can.  She\nalso reported seeing residents wandering about outside during the\nwinter, without shoes and wearing only pajamas. 32/\nInformation Relating to Fire Hazards\nThe Head of Security voiced a concern that certain\nresidents, particularly those in the Baker Building, would not be\nable to evacuate their units in the event of a fire.  The\ninfirmary which houses the most physically restricted patients is\nlocated on the top floor of the Baker Building, which does not\nhave a fire escape.  When a fire occurs, these patients are\ndirected to go to the roof.  The sprinkler system has not been\ntested and the Head of Security (who is also the Safety and\nEnvironmental Inspector) is not certain whether that system or\nthe alarms are functional.  She has reported these and other\nsafety concerns to her superiors, but it does not appear any\nfollow-up actions have been taken. 33/\nConclusion\nBased upon the information received to date, State officials\nmay be subjecting residents at Arlington to conditions that\ndeprive them of their constitutional rights, pursuant to a\npattern and practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of their\nrights.  In our opinion, the information we have obtained with\nrespect to conditions at Arlington warrants an investigation,\npursuant to CRIPA, into the areas specified above.  Funds are\navailable to conduct this investigation.\nAccordingly, we have attached for your signature the appro-\npriate letters notifying State and Federal officials of our\nintent to investigate the Arlington Developmental Center.\nAttachments\n31/ Parent, Moore, McMahan's notes, supra.

The 2006 Settlement Agreement was filed therewith.  [Dkt. No. \n2085].  Following a hearing on February 15, 2007, the Court approved the 2006 Settlement \nAgreement.  The Court has entered the All-Party Consent Onler To Motion To Approve \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 2209  Filed 09/11/2007  Page 2 of 5 \nSettlement Agreement (''Order Approving Settlement\").  rDkt. No. 21741.  Among other things. \nthe Order Approving Settlement orders that the 2006 Settlement Agreement is a fair and \nreasonable compromise, and is approved. \nOne of the issues resolved by the 2006 Settlement Agreement related to filing of a motion \nto show cause by People First and the resulting Order Requiring Defendants To Appear and \nShow Cause (the \"Show Cause Order'') entered by this Court on April 5, 2004.  [See 2006 \nSettlement Agreement, Sections I and X.B.].  Another issue resolved by the 2006 Settlement \nAgreement is the appropriate interpretation of that portion of the class definition in this case that \nreads ''all persons at risk of being placed at Arlington Developmental Center\" (commonly \nreferred to as the \"at-risk\" portion of the class).  [See 2006 Settlement Agreement, Sections I, X, \nand XI]. \nSection XI reads as follows (quoted in italics): \nXI.

[Dkt. 1302].  The State appealed the July \n17 Order and that appeal was pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit as of date on which the Order Approving Settlement was entered by this Court.

Even if four of the named plaintiffs did not have standing, one plaintiff would and, therefore, \nthis Court can appropriately consider the other issues raised in the motion to dismiss. The issue of standing will not \nbe addressed in this opinion, but will be subsequently considered. See Order filed Oct. 1, 1992, allowing plaintiffs \nadditional time to request discovery on the issue of standing, if warranted. \n \n2  These claims were: (1) Title XIX of the Social Security Act; (2) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \n  § 794); (3) the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Constitution; (4) the Equal Protection Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Constitution; and (5) the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n \n3  The motion to dismiss also raised the issue of standing. See note 1, supra. \n \n \n4  Defendants do not contend the Eleventh Amendment is a bar to plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. \n  Thus, the Court’s analysis under the Rehabilitative act is not only applicable to the named individual plaintiffs, but is \nalso applicable to the defendant agencies. \n \n5  The parties agree that Title XIX does not expressly provide for a private right of action. \n \n4 \n \n\n \n \nPeople First of Tennessee v. Arlington Developmental Center, 878 F.Supp. 97 (1992)   \n47 Soc.Sec.Rep.Serv. 188, 4 A.D. Cases 123, 9 A.D.D. 804, 6 NDLR P 134 \n \n \n6  Although Title XIX does not provide the mechanism for private enforcement of standards of care, the essence of \n  some of these claims is remedied through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See substantive \ndue process analysis, infra. \n \n7  Plaintiffs and defendants agree that the analysis under § 504 and Title II would be the same under the facts and \n  claims asserted by the plaintiffs. Additionally, the parties agree that the Eleventh Amendment is not a bar to claims \narising under Title II of the ADA and § 504. \n \n8  Although the vast majority of residents at Arlington were placed there at the request of their parents or guardians, \n  as opposed to a court commitment procedure, it is reasonable to infer from the facts as alleged that there is \nsufficient state action in the process used to admit residents into the facility to trigger substantive due process rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. See Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2503, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979) \n(“It is not disputed that a child, in common with adults, has a substantial liberty interest in not being confined \nunnecessarily for medical treatment and that the state’s involvement in the commitment decision constitutes state \naction under the Fourteenth Amendment”). Also, under Tennessee law, once an individual is confined to Arlington \nthe  mentally  retarded  person  is  under  the  “exclusive  care,  custody  and  control  of  the  commissioner  and \nsuperintendent.” Tenn.Code Ann. § 33–5–103. Once the state has accepted the individual into its custody and \ncontrol, the state has assumed some responsibility for the safety and well-being of the resident. See DeShaney v. \nWinnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189, 198–200, 109 S.Ct. 988, 1005, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). \nMoreover, the alleged harm is caused by state actors who control every aspect of the resident’s daily life, including \ntreatment, care and his or her movement in and out of the institution. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n5 \n ",

It appears \nuncontested by the parties that there are no longer any children at Arlington and that this part of the Court’s ruling \nis now irrelevant. \n \n4  The Court defined the plaintiff class to include not only current (and certain former) residents of Arlington but also \n  “all persons at risk of being placed” at Arlington. (People First, Case No. 92–2213, D.E. # 305.) \n \n5  See D.E. # 305 and D.E. # 306 in Case No. 92–2213. \n \n \n6  This case was transferred to the undersigned judge from the Honorable Jon P. McCalla in 2000. \n \n \n7  Defendants’ motion also cites Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) as a basis for their motion, but since Defendants seek relief from \n  orders already entered, the motion should be considered under Rule 60(b). \n \n8  The Sixth Circuit’s local rules formerly disfavored citation to opinions not selected for publication, but Rule 28(f) has \n  liberalized the Circuit’s rules regarding citation to unpublished opinions. See 6th Cir. R. 28(f) (2009); see also Fed. \nR.App. P. 32.1(b). \n5 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. Tennessee, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2009)   \n \n \n \n9  The Tennessee General Assembly first enacted language requiring a discharge upon application within twelve hours \n  in 1993. See 1993 Tenn. Laws Pub. Ch. 283 (H.B.659). \n \n10  Tennessee law defines a “conservator” as a “person or persons appointed by the court to provide partial or full \n  supervision, protection and assistance of the person or property, or both, of a disabled person [.]” Tenn.Code Ann. § \n34–1–101(4). A “guardian” is a “person or persons appointed by the court to provide partial or full supervision, \nprotection and assistance of the person or property, or both, of a minor[.]” Id. § 34–1–101(10). The guardian of a \nminor who “has previously been determined to be a disabled person” automatically continues as the conservator of \nthe minor upon the minor’s eighteenth birthday. Id. § 34–2–106(c). \n \n11  Although Defendants originally erred in believing that Higgs had not been cited to Judge McCalla in support of \n  dismissing this case when it first began, they have since acknowledged that they did submit the opinion to the Court \nfor consideration. But, even now unpublished decisions “are not precedentially binding under the doctrine of stare \ndecisis but may be considered for their persuasive value[.]” United States v. Paull, 551 F.3d 516, 532 n. 1 (6th \nCir.2009)(Griffin, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \n \n12  Judge Suhrheinrich authored a separate concurrence stating that he agreed with the other two judges’ decision to \n  affirm the trial court’s dismissal of the case, but that he rejected the majority’s distinction based on whether the \nplaintiff  had  been  committed  voluntarily  or  involuntarily.  Higgs,  1991  WL  216464,  at  *6  (Suhrheinrich,  J., \nconcurring). Instead, he would have held that the state’s simple negligence in failing to protect the victim from other \npatients did not constitute a violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights.

PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT\nA. Background\nThis case was initiated by the United States in January of\n1992 pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act,\n42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq.  The United States alleged that the State\nhad  violated  the  constitutional  rights  of  residents  of  the\nArlington Development Center (“ADC”), a State-run intermediate care\nfacility  for  mentally  retarded  individuals.    ADC’s  “population\nconsists primarily of individuals currently assessed as severely or\nprofoundly retarded or developmentally disabled, some of whom have\nassociated physical handicaps, and mental or behavioral problems.”\nUnited States v. State of Tennessee, 925 F. Supp. 1292, 1296 (W.D.\nTenn. 1995).  After trial, the court found serious and pervasive\nviolations of ADC residents’ rights to safety, freedom from harm,\nadequate food, shelter, medical care, freedom from restraint, and\nadequate habilitation.  The parties negotiated an agreement, the\nRemedial Order, that the court entered as a consent decree on\nSeptember 2, 1994.  The Remedial Order provided for the closure of\nadmissions to ADC, improved services for ADC residents, and the\n-2-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 3 of 30    PageID 16631\ntransfer of ADC residents to community placements.  Alternative\nmeans  of  delivering  necessary  care  and  services  to  mentally\nretarded individuals in west Tennessee would replace ADC.\nIn 1995, the court allowed People First to intervene in the\ncase.  The court certified a plaintiff class, consisting of present\nand former residents of ADC and persons at risk of admission to\nADC.  People First was appointed class representative.  The court\napproved  a  Community  Plan  for  placing  ADC  residents  into\nappropriate community placements in 1997.  Currently, ADC remains\nopen, though with a reduced number of residents.  \nOne feature of the Remedial Order was the establishment of a\ncourt monitor tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that the\nState complied with the Remedial Order.  Initially Dr. Linda R.\nO’Neall was appointed as court monitor.  She was replaced by Dr.\nNancy K. Ray, who has served continuously as the monitor since\nDecember 13, 2000.  Section XV of the Remedial Order provided as\nfollows:\nB. The duties of the Monitor will include:\n1. Conduct  on-site  reviews  at  ADC  and  community\nplacements of former ADC residents covered by this\nOrder  at  least  semi-annually  to  determine\ncompliance with all provisions of this Order.  A\nreasonable  number  of  expert  consultants  may  be\nretained to assist the Monitor in these reviews.\n2. Produce a Compliance Report after each review which\ncontains the results of the on-site review and a\nsummary  of  the  information  contained  in  reports\nsubmitted by ADC, including any follow-up action\ntaken  by  the  Monitor.    This  report  should  be\n-3-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 4 of 30    PageID 16632\nsubmitted to the Court and both parties.\n3. Be  available  by  phone,  correspondence  and,  when\nneeded, in person to the residents and staff of\nADC,  parents  and  guardians  of  residents  of  ADC,\nparties to this litigation, and to the Court.\n4. Review all ADC policies and procedures adopted to\nimplement the objectives of this Order and provide\nadvice  to  Defendants  regarding  the  efficacy  and\nappropriateness of such policies and procedures.\n5. Undertake  special  assignments,  tasks,  and\ninvestigations as may be requested or ordered by\nthe Court.\n6. Prepare and submit to the Court, with a copy to\nDefendants, annual budgets for all costs associated\nwith the duties and responsibilities of the Monitor\nand revise these as necessary to accomplish special\nassignments, tasks, and investigations if these are\nrequired by the court.  The Defendants will have\nfifteen  (15)  days  after  receipt  to  submit  any\ncomments to the Court.\n7. Submit  monthly  invoices  to  the  Court  for\nreimbursement,  with  a  copy  to  Defendants.    The\nDefendants  will  have  fifteen  (15)  days  after\nreceipt to submit any comments to the Court.\nC. The  Monitor  will  have  unlimited  access  to  all\nresidents,  staff,  consultants,  records  (including\nindividual resident’s records), files (other than files\nof the ADC attorney), facilities, buildings and premises\nsubject to this action.  The Defendants will not refuse\nany reasonable request by the Monitor for documents or\nother information and will permit confidential interviews\nof staff. . . .\nG. In instances described in this Order in which the\nMonitor  may  give  or  withhold  approval,  the  Monitor’s\ndecision must consider the reasonableness, feasibility\nand efficacy of the proposed modification in satisfying\nthe terms of this remedial Order.  In all instances in\nthis Remedial Plan in which approval by the Monitor is\nspecified,  the  Monitor’s  decision  is  effective\nimmediately and will remain in effect unless overturned\nby  the  Court.    If  either  party  disagrees  with  the\n-4-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 5 of 30    PageID 16633\nposition taken by the Monitor, the following recourse\nwill be available:\na.  The dissatisfied party will inform the Monitor\nin writing of the basis for its disagreement with the\nMonitor’s decision within ten working days; the other\nparty will be given an opportunity to comment within ten\nworking days; the Monitor will reconsider the decision to\napprove or disapprove and make a final decision within\nfive working days of the receipt of the last set of\nparty’s comments.\nb. If the dissatisfied party disagrees with the\nMonitor’s reconsideration of the approval decision, the\nparty  may  present  the  issue  to  the  Court  for\ndetermination within five working days of the Monitor’s\nfinal decision. . . .\n(Remedial Order, D.E. 338 at 47-49.)  Under Section XIV of the\norder, the monitor was granted the authority to approve or deny the\ntransfer of residents out of the ADC.  (Id. at 44-45.) \nThe  present  motion  to  suspend  the  monitor  arises  from\ndiscovery that was conducted by the State in response to contempt\nproceedings initiated by People First on February 13, 2008.  People\nFirst alleged in its Motion for Contempt and Specific Performance\nthat  the  State  failed  and  refused  to  perform  its  obligations\nrequired under the Settlement Agreement executed by the parties on\nMay 5, 2006 and approved by the court on February 15, 2007.  (D.E.\n2174.)  The contempt proceedings were brought about in part by a\nletter sent from Dr. Ray to the court, dated February 1, 2008,\ndetailing the alleged failure by the State to meet its obligations\n(“February 1 Letter”).  (D.E. 2234-1.)\nThe court scheduled a hearing on the contempt motion for July\n-5-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 6 of 30    PageID 16634\nof 2009.  In preparation for the hearing, the State served document\nrequests on People First that requested copies of People First’s\nrelevant communications with Dr. Ray.  People First objected to the\ndocument requests, contending that the communications between Dr.\nRay and People First were not discoverable.  On March 17, 2009, the\nState filed a motion to compel discovery, and on June 10, 2009, the\nDistrict Judge granted the State’s motion to compel and ordered\nPeople First to produce its communications with Dr. Ray.  In that\norder, the District Judge noted that “[t]he Court Monitor is not\naligned with any party, nor is she an agent or expert for any\nparty.  Rather, the Court Monitor is neutral and acts as an ‘agent\nof the Court.’”  (D.E. 2407.)  \nPursuant to that order, People First and Dr. Ray produced\ntheir communications.1  After reviewing the communications, the\nState filed the present motion.  The State alleges that numerous\nemails between People First and Dr. Ray show, at the very least, an\nappearance of partiality on the part of Dr. Ray.  Based on these\ncommunications, the State asserts that Dr. Ray can no longer be\nconsidered a neutral agent of the court, and therefore should be\nremoved as the court monitor.\nB. Emails and Attorney Billing Records\n1People  First  was  not  able  to  produce  all  of  the  responsive\ncommunications, as the hard drive that stored emails for one of the\nattorneys  for  People  First  “crashed.”    As  an  alternative  to\nordering the hard drive restored, the court ordered Dr. Ray to\nproduce responsive emails from her computer system.   \n-6-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 7 of 30    PageID 16635\nThe emails that the State presents as evidence of Dr. Ray’s\nappearance of partiality are attached as exhibits to its initial\nmotion (D.E. 2429), supplemental memoranda (D.E. 2466 & 2486), and\nits  Reply  in  Support  of  Their  Supplemental  Motion  to  Compel\nDiscovery (D.E. 2402).  The majority of the emails consist of\ncommunications between counsel for People First, Dr. Ray, and third\nparties  (not  including  the  State),  in  which  Dr.  Ray  shared\ninformation or her opinions with these parties:2 \n(1) November 27, 2007 email from Dr. Ray to Guardian\nCommunity Living, copying People First, stating that “I\nwould not sign transition plans where funding consistent\nwith Waiver rules was not apparent,” and “hoping that\n[People First will] take some action within a week”;\n(2) December 9, 2007 email from Dr. Ray to People First\nstating that “I suspect ADC would not close any time\nsoon”; \n(3) January 3, 2008 email from Dr. Ray to People First\nregarding reports prepared by a consultant for the State,\nstating “I think that you should subpoena these reports”;\n \n(4) January 9, 2008 email from Dr. Ray to People First\nforwarding complaints about rate cuts, stating “[m]ore\ninformation . . . that may be useful”;\n(5) January 9, 2008 email from Dr. Ray to People First\nindicating  that  the  individual  who  forwarded  the\ncomplaints “may be a person worth connecting with”; \n(6) January 22, 2008 email from People First to Dr. Ray\nregarding a draft letter to the State proposing to meet\nand confer on contempt issues (“Meet and Confer Letter”).\nIn the email, People First asks “Dear Nancy . . . We\npropose to send this letter.  We would appreciate your\n2These communications were with one or more attorneys for People\nFirst.  The court will refer to counsel for People First as simply\n“People First.”\n-7-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 8 of 30    PageID 16636\ntaking a look at it to see if it is wrong anywhere and\nletting us know so we can send it out.”  On that same\nday, Dr. Ray sent People First an email, stating “[t]hank\nyou very much for taking this step.  I like this letter.\nIt hits all the main points.  I have added a few notes,\nwhich relate to additional information about cuts that I\nhave received from providers, as well as my review of the\nproposed Waiver amendments.”  Dr. Ray added the following\ncomments to the proposed Meet and Confer Letter: \n. . . My concern as well is that the State has not\nconfirmed that this change will stay in place – it seems\nthis may have been a temporary move until the TennCare\nMCOs can be readied.\n. . . The proposed amendments to the Main Waiver actually\ncall for this change.\n. . . .\n. . . Need to clarify that the only published “draft”\nprotocols address nutrition, behavioral supports, and\nclinical  therapies.    No  protocol  has  been  released\nactually addressing residential and day services that are\ntied  to  the  ICAP.    There  are  also  significant  cuts\nrelated to arbitrarily reducing the rates of persons in\nsingle person homes to 2-person rates (although there is\nno housemate and no evidence of State efforts to assist\nproviders  find  housemates  for  these  individuals).\nSpecial  Needs  Allowances  originally  proposed  to  be\nongoing  (largely  due  to  the  individuals’  substantial\nphysical  challenges)  are  being  arbitrarily  cut.\nSignificantly, the proposed Waiver amendments delete the\nprovision  for  ongoing  SNAs  for  persons  with  extreme\nphysical challenges.  This change will have significant\nadverse impact on these individuals who require two to\nthree persons to transfer.  It will require providers to\ncut  staff  especially  in  the  evening  and  at  night\ncompromising individuals’ ability to exit in the event of\nan emergency in the three minute time frame required.

The entries indicate: “[r]eviewed draft letter from\n[Dr. Ray] concerning impact of recent policy changes, provided\ncomments  on  substance  and  strategy  to  co-counsel  via  email”;\n“[c]ontinuing  email  and  other  discussions  to  prepare  for\nlitigation;  reviewed  final  draft  on  Monitor’s  letter”;\n“[c]orrespondence  monitor,  co-counsel,  providers  re  service\n-14-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 15 of 30    PageID\n 16643\nreductions”; and “[c]ontinuing email dialogue with Dr. Ray, CSN,\nproviders and/or co-counsel concerning budget and service cuts,\nbreach of the 2006 Settlement Agreement; and litigation strategy.”\n(D.E. 2429-16.)

Court Monitor’s Testimony\nDr. Ray testified at the hearing on the contempt motion before\nthe District Judge from July 6 through July 9, 2009.  In response\nto  cross-examination  by  the  State,  Dr.  Ray  discussed  her\nunderstanding of her duties as monitor and the proper procedures\nfor fulfilling those duties.  With respect to her duty to ensure\ncompliance with court orders, Dr. Ray testified:\nI  certainly  corresponded  with  the  Department  of\nJustice to inform the parties of these policies which I\nfelt  had  an  adverse  impact  on  class  members  and  may\nviolate the court orders in the case.  And I’ve been\ndoing  –  having  that  kind  of  interaction  with  the\nplaintiff parties and the state since I started this job.\nIf I thought something was going awry, particularly\n4In response to the State’s motion, People First produced sixteen\nex parte emails between Dr. Ray and the State that People First\nobtained during discovery, suggesting that Dr. Ray’s communications\nwith the State have been similar in kind to her communications with\nPeople First.  (D.E. 2470-2.)  The court has reviewed each of these\nemails and finds nothing inappropriate with these communications,\nas they reflect the State’s discussions with Dr. Ray regarding\ncompliance issues.\n-15-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 16 of 30    PageID\n 16644\nin a systemic way, I would try to involve the parties.\nAnd I would try to have all the parties sit down and\ndiscuss the problems.  And indeed that was a major focus\nof quarterly parties’ meetings which we’ve had on a very\nregular  basis.    And  I  would  inform  the  parties  for\nseveral different reasons, the most important reason was\nthat I was afraid that class members were being harmed.\nThe second reason was I wanted simply them to be\ninformed of system’s changes that were occurring that I\nthought were adversely affecting class members or would\nin the future.\nAnd the third was that I was hopeful that they would\nbe able to work effectively with the state to get the\npolicies back into a place where they weren’t harmful to\nclass members, and they were in more compliance with the\ncourt’s orders.\n(7/9/09  Tr.  at  31-32.)    Dr.  Ray  was  questioned  specifically\nregarding her communications with People First:\nQ. Is it true that you asked [People First] to help by\ncomplaining about these issues to the court as part of\nwhat subsequently became the contempt motion?\nA. I think I probably did, you know, I asked all the\nparties to understand and to help with these.  I mean,\nthat was the – I mean, I don’t just call or e-mail the\nDepartment of Justice or People First for no reason.  I\nthought these were serious problems.  They evolved into\nvery serious problems.\nThe second one evolved into such serious problems\nthat the state reversed the policy.\nI – I think I would have been negligent not to have\ninformed the parties.  I don’t run the monitoring shop\nlike I’m a lone person on a horse.  I work with the\nparties.\n. . . .\n. . . I asked him to help with working with the\nparties on the matter if they chose that – in this case,\nsince my tenure, the parties have tried to work together\nto solve problems most of the time.  Very fortunately we\n-16-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 17 of 30    PageID\n 16645\nhave not had to bring a lot of conflicts to the court,\nand we’ve been able to solve things and move the system\nforward.  I think that’s a very appropriate way to work.\n(Id. at 35-36.) \nFurther questioning from the State explored the relationship\nbetween Dr. Ray, People First, and the United States:\nQ. And you asked counsel for both the United States and\nfor People First to raise your concern with the court,\ncorrect?\nA. Right.\nQ. Was it your practice to have plaintiff’s counsel\npresent  your  views  to  the  court  in  advance  of  the\nconcerns that you have?\nA. I don’t know how many times I may have made this –\nthis specific request.  But if there were going to be a\ncourt hearing, and there were any issues of compliance,\nit wouldn’t – I – I don’t know how many times I did this\n. . . I may have only done it this one time, but it might\ncome up again.\nQ. But you didn’t tell the state that you wanted the\nplaintiff’s counsel to raise this – \nA. The state knew well that I was sharing this with the\nplaintiffs and that I was very concerned and that I was\nconsidering discussing this with Judge Donald.\n(Id. at 98-99.)  Dr. Ray was asked on redirect to clarify the role\nher work as monitor played in aiding the parties:\nQ. In your experience, has it ever occurred and in any\nother case that counsel for the plaintiff parties took\ninformation  that  was  communicated  in  reports  of  the\nmonitor  and  used  it  in  a  motion  for  contempt  or\nenforcement?\nA. Typically happened.\nQ. It happens often?\n-17-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 18 of 30    PageID\n 16646\nA. Often.\nQ. And does that mean in such cases that there is a\nconspiracy or a coordinated effort between the monitor\nand the plaintiffs to craft a litigation strategy?\nA. No, I actually think it would be almost inevitable,\nbecause,  you  know,  the  plaintiffs  have  come  together\nusually on a settlement agreement or in this case there’s\na  court  order.    And  they,  you  know,  part  of  the\nresolution  has  been  the  appointment  of  a  monitor  to\nmonitor a settlement agreement or to monitor the court\norder.\nSo in – in all of my experience, really the way the\nplaintiff parties initially hear about a noncompliance\nconcern by the defendants is from the court monitor’s\nreports.\n(Id. at 122-23.)\nDr. Ray was also questioned about the January 22, 2008 email\nin which she made comments to the proposed Meet and Confer Letter\nthat People First later sent to the State:\nQ. Was it your practice, Dr. Ray, to provide editorial\ncomments on correspondence that People First drafted in\nconnection with this litigation?\nA. It doesn’t happen very often, but if they asked me\nfor comments, I would give it.  Just like the state often\nasks  me  for  comments  on  drafts  of  policies  or  even\ncorrespondence with parents or – or others, and I would\nI would [sic] assist in whatever way that I could.\nQ. Has [plaintiff’s counsel] ever asked to you [sic]\nedit or comment or review draft motions or papers to be\nfiled with the court?\nA. No.\n(Id. at 61.)  On redirect, Dr. Ray was further questioned about the\ndraft Meet and Confer Letter:\nQ. [People  First]  wrote  to  you  and  said  we  would\n-18-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 19 of 30    PageID\n 16647\nappreciate you’re taking a look at this letter to see if\nit is wrong anywhere and letting us know.\nWhat did you understand that he was asking you to do\nwhen he asked, take a look at it to see if it is wrong\nanywhere?\nA. I thought he was asking me to check if it was wrong\nanywhere.\nQ. In other words, for accuracy?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Factual accuracy?\nA. Yes . . . .\n(Id. at 125-26.)  \nThe State also questioned Dr. Ray about her February 1 Letter:\nQ. Am  I  correct  in  understanding  that  counsel  for\nPeople First reviewed a draft and edited this letter\nbefore you submitted it to the court?\nA. You know, I don’t know about that.  I don’t really\nrecall it.  I want to say that it would not be highly\nunusual that in sending – before I would notify the – the\n– Judge Donald about these major issues that I saw in the\nstate  policy  that  I  wouldn’t  ask  perhaps  them  for\ncomment.  So I – I well could have.  I can’t remember\nthough that they made any, but maybe they did.\n(Id. at 82.)\nFinally,  Dr.  Ray  responded  to  questions  regarding  the\npropriety of ex parte contacts with the parties:\nQ. Did you participate in any strategy session with\ncounsel for the plaintiffs in connection with this case?\nA. I don’t think so.  Okay.  I – I want to – I – you\nknow, I certainly want to be clear that I have talked\nwith state officials and I have talked to the plaintiffs,\nand I have talked to the Department of Justice about my\nconcerns that have been happening in view of certain rate\n-19-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 20 of 30    PageID\n 16648\ncuts, changes in policy, and how I thought they would\nadversely affect class members.\nI have clearly – I just feel that I have to say this\nthat, loudly, I have had those discussions five hundred\ntimes before with various state officials than I have\nwith the plaintiffs parties.\nBut  I  have  had  those  discussions,  and  I  would\ncontinue to do that again because I would do anything to\nprevent the adverse impact on class members.\nAnd if I – and obviously one reason why I have more\ndiscussions with various state officials on this topic\nthan – than the plaintiffs was that they are in the best\nposition and the quickest people to fix it.\n. . . . \nQ. Dr. Ray, how long have you been the monitor in this\ncase?\nA. Since December of 2000.\nQ. And you had occasion to have private meals with\nDeputy  Commissioner  Norris  [a  representative  of  the\nState] in those many years?\nA. Yes, I have. . . .\nQ. . . . And have you extended an invitation to the\nUnited States to attend any of these meals?\nA. No, I haven’t.\nQ. Does  that  mean  that  you  are  biased  against  the\nUnited States because you did not invite us to these\nprivate meetings at which you discussed compliance of\ncourt orders?\nA. No.  I thought that actually we would be able to\nmake more progress towards compliance if I met with Mr.\nNorris.  And often I meet with Ms. Payne and John Kaufman\nand other senior staff at the same time.  I tried to sort\nof negotiate it out first with one . . . .\nQ. . . . Is it your understanding that in order to\nfacilitate  compliance  with  the  court  orders  as  court\n-20-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 21 of 30    PageID\n 16649\nmonitor you must work with, at sometimes, with one party\nand at sometimes more than one party?\nA. Yes.\n(Id. at 75, 131-32.)\nII.  PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nThe State contends, and the opposing parties do not dispute,\nthat Dr. Ray is governed by the “appearance of partiality” standard\nunder  28  U.S.C.  §  455(a).    That  statute  provides  that  “[a]ny\njustice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall\ndisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality\nmight reasonably be questioned.”5  28 U.S.C. § 455(a).  Section 455\nis designed “‘to promote confidence in the judiciary by avoiding\neven the appearance of impropriety whenever possible.’”  Union\nPlanters Bank v. L & J Dev. Co., 115 F.3d 378, 383 (6th Cir. 1997)\n(quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S.\n847, 865 (1988)).  Under § 455(a), the ultimate question is whether\n“a reasonable, objective person, knowing all of the circumstances,\nwould have questioned the judge’s impartiality.”  United States v.\nHartsel,  199  F.3d  812,  820  (6th  Cir.  1999);  see  also  In  re\nSurapaneni, 14 F. App’x 334, 337 (6th Cir. 2001) (stating that\n“[r]ecusal is mandated . . . only if a reasonable person with\n5Section 455(b)(1) provides a separate basis for disqualification\nof a judicial officer: “He shall also disqualify himself . . .\n[w]here he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or\npersonal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the\nproceeding[.]”  28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1).\n-21-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 22 of 30    PageID\n 16650\nknowledge  of  all  the  facts  would  conclude  that  the  judge’s\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned”) (quoting Easley v.\nUniv.  of  Mich.  Bd.  of  Regents,  853  F.2d  1351,  1356  (6th  Cir.\n1988)); Reed v. Rhodes, 179 F.3d 453, 467 (6th Cir. 1999) (stating\nthat when confronted with a motion to recuse, “a district judge\nmust apply an objective standard of inquiry: Would a reasonable\nperson knowing all the relevant facts question the impartiality of\nthe judge?”).\nOn its face, § 455 applies only to justices, judges, and\nmagistrate judges – not to court monitors.  The State argues,\nhowever, that § 455 applies to Dr. Ray via Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 53.  Rule 53 extends the application of § 455 to special\nmasters  by  providing  that  a  special  master  “must  not  have  a\nrelationship to the parties, attorneys, action, or court that would\nrequire disqualification of a judge under 28 U.S.C. § 455, unless\nthe parties, with the court’s approval, consent to the appointment\nafter  the  master  discloses  any  potential  grounds  for\ndisqualification.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  53(a)(2);  see  also  In  re\nKempthorne, 449 F.3d 1265, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (stating that\n“[w]e  have  held  that  a  special  master  is  subject  to  the  same\nethical restrictions as a judge when the special master serves as\nthe ‘functional equivalent’ of a judge even though the special\nmaster is under a judge’s ‘control’”) (citing Jenkins v. Sterlacci,\n849 F.2d 627, 630-32 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).  \n-22-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 23 of 30    PageID\n 16651\nLike § 455, Rule 53 does not on its face apply to court\nmonitors.    Moreover,  a  court  monitor  is  not  the  functional\nequivalent of a special master.  See Cobell v. Norton, 334 F.3d\n1128, 1144 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (recognizing the “extrajudicial” role\nof a court monitor, contrasting it with the “judicial” role of a\nspecial master, and applying § 455 to the latter).  “Whereas a\nmonitor’s ‘primary function is to monitor compliance,’ a master’s\nrole is broader: to ‘report[] to the court and, if required, make[]\nfindings of facts and conclusions of law.’”  Cobell v. Norton, 392\nF.3d  461,  476  (D.C.  Cir.  2004)  (quoting  Special  Project,  The\nRemedial Process in Institutional Reform Litigation, 78 Colum. L.\nRev. 784, 827-28 (1978)).  For example, Rule 53(c) provides that,\nunless the appointing order directs otherwise, a special master may\n“regulate all proceedings,” “if conducting an evidentiary hearing,\nexercise the appointing court’s power to compel, take, and record\nevidence,” and “by order . . . impose on a party any noncontempt\nsanction provided by Rule 37 or 45, and may recommend a contempt\nsanction against a party and sanctions against a nonparty.”  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 53(c).  Dr. Ray possesses none of these powers. \nUnder the terms of the Remedial Order, Dr. Ray’s duties are\nlimited  to  monitoring  compliance.    She  is  to  conduct  on-site\nreviews at ADC, submit compliance reports to the court and both\nparties, be available to the parties and the court, review all ADC\npolicies and procedures and provide advice to the State regarding\n-23-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 24 of 30    PageID\n 16652\nthem, undertake special assignments as ordered by the court, and\nsubmit  annual  budgets  and  monthly  invoices  for  reimbursement.\nAlthough  she  has  the  authority  to  approve  or  disapprove  the\ntransfer of residents out of the ADC, this authority does not make\nher the functional equivalent of a special master.  Cf. Juan F. v.\nWeicker, 37 F.3d 874, 880 (2d Cir. 1994) (finding that the “court\nmonitor” was actually a special master, albeit by another name,\nbecause like a special master the “court monitor” had the power to\nhold meetings, request information, issue reports, hear evidence,\nand issue findings of fact).  Because Dr. Ray is not a special\nmaster, she is not governed by Rule 53 or 28 U.S.C. § 455.  See\nCobell, 392 F.3d at 476 (finding that “a monitor’s activities are\nso unlike those of a rule 53 master that the court should not\n[designate a monitor a master]” and that “[m]onitoring rarely, if\never, proceeds by the quasi-judicial hearings envisaged by rule\n53”)  (quoting  The  Remedial  Process  in  Institutional  Reform\nLitigation, supra, at 829).\nNevertheless, as the District Judge has observed in her prior\norders, the court monitor “is not aligned with any party, nor is\nshe an agent or expert for any party.  Rather, the Court Monitor is\nneutral and acts as an ‘agent of the Court.’”  (D.E. 2130 & 2407.)\nThe question, then, is whether Dr. Ray’s communications demonstrate\nthat she has aligned herself with any party or is no longer a\nneutral agent of the court.  In making this determination, the\n-24-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 25 of 30    PageID\n 16653\ncourt bears in mind that although Dr. Ray is not to be aligned with\nany party, her role as a monitor is significantly different from\nthat  of  a  judge.    She  is  permitted  to  engage  in  ex  parte\ncommunications with the parties, and is expressly delegated with\nthe duty to “[b]e available by phone, correspondence and, when\nneeded, in person to the residents and staff of ADC, parents and\nguardians of residents of ADC, parties to this litigation, and to\nthe  Court.”    (Remedial  Order,  D.E.  338  at  48).    She  is  also\nauthorized to “[r]eview all ADC policies and procedures adopted to\nimplement  the  objectives  of  this  Order  and  provide  advice  to\nDefendants  regarding  the  efficacy  and  appropriateness  of  such\npolicies and procedures.”  (Id.)  Thus, the fact that Dr. Ray has\nextensively communicated ex parte with the parties does not raise\nconcerns regarding her neutrality.\nMoreover, Dr. Ray’s primary responsibility as court monitor is\nto ensure that the State complies with the court’s orders, and by\ndoing  so,  she  protects  the  rights  of  the  mentally  retarded\nindividuals at the ADC.  For that reason, it is understandable that\nher actions in connection with her duties as court monitor may\nappear to be adversarial to the State and supportive of People\nFirst and the United States.  That Dr. Ray’s interests as court\nmonitor overlap with those of People First and the United States\ndoes not render her impermissibly aligned with these parties.\nIn  addition,  as  made  clear  from  the  parties’  court\n-25-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 26 of 30    PageID\n 16654\nsubmissions, the parties’ course of dealing with Dr. Ray over the\nyears has resulted in her role as court monitor evolving somewhat\ninto that of a facilitator and advisor.  She regularly communicates\nex parte with representatives of all parties, provides them with\nguidance, advice, and criticism, and works with the parties to try\nto solve problems with minimal court intervention – all in an\neffort to address issues that arise on a day-to-day basis in an\nefficient, expeditious, and cost-effective manner.\nFor these reasons, conduct that would certainly raise concerns\nif engaged in by a judge would not necessarily raise concerns if\nengaged in by Dr. Ray.6  With that in mind, the court has carefully\nreviewed the emails, billing records, and relevant portions of Dr.\nRay’s  July  9,  2009  hearing  transcript,  and  concludes  that  she\nshould not be suspended as court monitor.\n6The parties have not cited, and the court in conducting its own\nresearch could not find, any cases analogous to the present case.\nThe cases cited by the State are distinguishable from the case at\nbar.  See In re Kempthorne, 449 F.3d at 1270 (finding that a\nspecial master responsible for investigating misconduct charges\nbrought by a corporation against the Department of the Interior\nshould have recused himself after he hired a former employee of the\ncorporation to assist the special master in preparing reports about\nthe investigation); In re Kensington Int’l Ltd., 368 F.3d 289, 309\n(3d Cir. 2004) (finding that a judge should have recused himself\nbecause his court-appointed advisors had conflicts of interest);\nEdgar v. K.L., 93 F.3d 256, 261-62 (7th Cir. 1996) (disqualifying\na  judge  because  the  panel  of  court-appointed  experts  had  been\ninfluenced by secret submissions from advocacy groups and counsel\nsupporting plaintiffs in other litigation); United States v. City\nof Detroit, No. 03-72258 (E.D. Mich. July 24, 2009) (copy attached\nto State’s Second Supplemental Mem., D.E. 2486-3) (dismissing court\nmonitor who had an inappropriate, possibly romantic, relationship\nwith the then-Mayor of Detroit).\n-26-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 27 of 30    PageID\n 16655\nThe vast majority of the emails relied upon by the State do\nnot raise concerns regarding Dr. Ray’s neutrality.  As for emails\ndrafted by Dr. Ray, these emails reflect Dr. Ray’s support of plans\nand policies that are favorable to the class (and thus favorable to\nPeople  First  and  the  United  States);  her  support  of  service\nproviders  who  have  expressed  concern  over  rate  cuts  and  other\nadverse action by the State; her disappointment in the State’s\nactions that she perceived to be contrary to the best interest of\nthe  ADC  residents;  and  emails  where  Dr.  Ray  has  passed  along\ninformation to People First and/or the United States that are of\nquestionable relevance to Dr. Ray’s neutrality.  As for emails that\nwere sent to Dr. Ray or on which Dr. Ray was copied with other\nrecipients,  while  the  emails  may  reflect  the  opinions  of  the\nsender, the court does not find that these emails show that Dr. Ray\nis impermissibly aligned with People First or is not neutral.  As\nfor emails sent from the State to Dr. Ray that she forwarded to\nPeople First and the United States, while the State may not be\npleased that Dr. Ray notified opposing counsel about concerns she\nhad with the State’s actions, this does not demonstrate that she is\nnot acting as a neutral agent of the court.  With respect to the\nemails sent from Dr. Ray that the State contends show she either\nreferred or attempted to refer prospective clients to People First,\nthe court does not find that these emails reflect an impermissible\nbias in favor of People First, as it appears that Dr. Ray was\n-27-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 28 of 30    PageID\n 16656\nattempting to provide a resource for individuals who are not class\nmembers.  Although some of Dr. Ray’s actions may arguably exceed\nthe scope of her duties under the Remedial Order, they do not\nprovide a basis to suspend her for bias.\nThe  State  argues  that  the  January  22,  2008  email\ncorrespondence  between  Dr.  Ray  and  People  First  regarding  the\nproposed Meet and Confer Letter shows that Dr. Ray is aligned with\nPeople First.  The court notes that the email correspondence began\nwith People First simply asking Dr. Ray to review the letter and\nthat “[w]e would appreciate your taking a look at it to see if it\nis wrong anywhere and letting us know so we can send it out.”  In\nresponse,  Dr.  Ray  provided  People  first  with  her  comments  and\nsuggested adding other, more detailed information.  The Remedial\nOrder directs the court monitor to “provide advice to Defendants\nregarding the efficacy and appropriateness of [all ADC] policies\nand procedures,” and although providing advice to People First\nregarding the State’s policies and procedures is not expressly\nprovided  for  in  the  order,  the  court  does  not  view  Dr.  Ray’s\nwillingness to share her views with the other parties in this case\nto be indicative of partiality.\nFinally,  the  State  contends  that  in  connection  with  the\nFebruary 1 Letter to the court, Dr. Ray sent a draft copy to People\nFirst to review and provide comments, without notifying the State\nand without giving the State an opportunity to provide comments.\n-28-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 29 of 30    PageID\n 16657\nAlthough it appears from Dr. Ray’s contempt hearing testimony and\nPeople First’s billing records that Dr. Ray, in fact, sent a draft\ncopy of the letter to People First for comment, it also appears,\nbased on her testimony that she had been having ongoing discussions\nwith the State regarding all of the issues raised in her letter,\nthat she had attempted unsuccessfully to convince the State to\nchange its views, and that none of the problems she raised in her\nletter should have come as a surprise to the State.  Perhaps, in\nretrospect, Dr. Ray should have sent a draft of her letter to all\nparties instead of only People First.  However, the court does not\nbelieve that her decision to send a draft of the letter only to\nPeople First demonstrates that she is not a neutral agent of the\ncourt.7\nIII.  RECOMMENDATION\nFor the reasons above, the court recommends that the motion be\ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted,\ns/ Tu M. Pham                   \nTU M. PHAM\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nFebruary 16, 2010                  \nDate\n7As  the  court  has  noted  above,  perhaps  some  of  the  monitor’s\nactions  may  have  exceeded  the  scope  of  her  duties  under  the\nRemedial Order.  For purposes of the present motion, the court need\nnot address this issue.  However, going forward, the parties might\nconsider amending the Remedial Order to more clearly define the\nscope of the court monitor’s duties and authority.\n-29-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2558   Filed 02/16/10   Page 30 of 30    PageID\n 16658\nNOTICE\nANY OBJECTIONS OR EXCEPTIONS TO THIS REPORT MUST BE FILED WITHIN\nFOURTEEN (14) DAYS AFTER BEING SERVED WITH A COPY OF THE REPORT.\n28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C).

After conducting the status \nconference as scheduled and considering the arguments of counsel along with the record in this \ncause, the Court issues the following report and recommendation.   \nI. Relevant Facts \n \nThree motions are currently pending in this case: (1) Intervenor Class Representative’s \n(“People First”) Motion for an Order to the State of Tennessee Defendant to Proceed with \nEnrollment of at Risk Class Members and to Appeal Denial of Class Membership by Defendants \n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2655   Filed 02/04/11   Page 2 of 3    PageID 17157\n \nfiled  October  22,  2010  (D.E.  #2604);  (2)  Defendants’  Motion  to  Vacate  All  Outstanding \nInjunctive Relief and to Dismiss the Case filed November 3, 2010 (D.E. #2605); and (3) Plaintiff \nUnited States of America’s Motion to Enforce the 2006 Settlement Agreement filed November 5, \n2010 (D.E. #2608).  On November 19, 2010, Defendants filed responses in opposition to the \nmotions filed by People First and the United States.  People First and the United States have not \nresponded to Defendants’ motion because, by order entered November 5, 2010, the District \nCourt found that the motion should be held in abeyance “until such time as the Court directs a \nresponse from the other parties to this case.”  (D.E. #2609: Order Holding in Abeyance Defs.’ \nMot. to Vacate All Outstanding Injunctive Relief and Dismiss the Case at 2, Nov. 5, 2010.) \nThe parties agree that People First’s motion and the motion of the United States are \nsubstantially the same and that the two motions should be addressed simultaneously.  The parties \ndisagree, however, as to when the District Court should consider the two motions.  The United \nStates and People First request a four-month period of discovery related to the two motions and \nthen a hearing date thirty days thereafter.  The United States and People First further request that \nthe Court take no action on Defendants’ motion to vacate at this time.  Defendants maintain that \ntheir motion to vacate should be addressed before proceeding to discovery related to the motions \nof People First and the United States because these two motions will become moot if the motion \nto vacate is granted.  Defendants also contend that the continued costs of this litigation to the \nState of Tennessee necessitate a ruling on the motion to vacate as soon as reasonably practicable. \nThe Court believes that discovery should proceed on the motions filed by the United \nStates and People First because the discovery taken for these two motions may also be relevant \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2655   Filed 02/04/11   Page 3 of 3    PageID 17158\n \nto the issues raised in Defendants’ motion to vacate.  The Court further believes that proceedings \non Defendants’ motion to vacate should not be held in abeyance indefinitely and that a briefing \nschedule should be established for the motion.   \nII. Recommendation  \nIt is therefore RECOMMENDED that the District Court allow the parties four months to \nconduct discovery as to the motions of People First and the United States and that a hearing \nbefore the District Court be set sometime thereafter.  As to Defendants’ motion to vacate, it is \nRECOMMENDED that People First and the United States file responses within five months, \nthat Defendants be permitted to file a reply one month thereafter, and that a hearing then be set \nbefore the District Court.   \nDated this 4th day of February, 2011. \n \ns/ Charmiane G.

This Court has never held that Dr. Ray  vigorous  cross-examination  concerning  these  opinions \nmust meet the requirements of Rule 702 in order to testify  and had the opportunity to present its own evidence to \nin the case. The State points to the Court’s Order Granting  counter Dr. Ray’s testimony and reports. \nin  Part  and  Denying  in  Part  Defendants’  Motion  in    \nLimine  to  Exclude  Testimony  and  Reports  from  the   \nMonitor  or  Her  Staff  (D.E.  2439)  in  support  of  its   \ncontention that Dr. Ray must qualify as an expert witness. \nThe Order states, however, that Dr. Ray “may testify as to \nany observations or findings related to compliance and as  (3) Whether Dr. Ray is a Neutral Agent of the Court \nto the information contained in reports the Court Monitor  The State asserts that the Court must strike Dr. Ray’s \nhas  generated  and  distributed  as  part  of  her  official  testimony and reports because she is no longer a neutral \nduties.” (Id. at 1.) This ruling is consistent with the role of  agent of the Court.

For the \nreasons that follow, the Court DENIES the State’s Motion. \nI. BACKGROUND  \n  a. Case History  \nThis case arises from the unconstitutional conditions that \nexisted at the Arlington Developmental Center (“Arlington”) in \nArlington, Tennessee. In 1992, the United States brought suit \nagainst the State pursuant to the Civil Rights of \nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997, alleging that \nthe care and conditions at Arlington violated the substantive \ndue process rights of the center’s residents. At the same time, \nPeople First, an advocacy organization for persons with \ndisabilities, and individual residents of Arlington brought a \nclass action suit against the State on behalf of all the \nresidents of Arlington and all those “at risk” of \ninstitutionalization at Arlington. The Court held a trial in \nUnited States v. Tennessee in 1993. At trial the Court found \nthat the conditions at Arlington did not comply with the \nsubstantive due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment \nas articulated by the Supreme Court in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 \nU.S. 307 (1982). (See Supplemental Findings of Fact (D.E. 251) \n4.) Following the trial and the parties’ negotiations, the Court \nentered the Remedial Order (D.E. 338) requiring the State to \n2 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 3 of 38    PageID 21557 \ntake certain actions to guarantee the Youngberg rights of \nArlington’s residents. \nIn September 1995, the Court certified the class in the \nPeople First action, defining the class as including individuals \nwho had resided, were residing, or were at risk of residing at \nArlington. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the certification of this \nclass. People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., \n145 F.3d 1332 (table), 1998 WL 246146, at *3 (6th Cir. May \n7,1998) (per curiam). The Court allowed People First to \nintervene in United States v. Tennessee and extended its \nliability finding and the Remedial Order in United States v. \nTennessee to the People First class. As a result of these \nconsolidated cases, the Court has for nearly two decades \nprovided judicial supervision over the conditions at Arlington \nand the State’s services for class members. \nThe Sixth Circuit has noted, “litigation between the \nparties has resulted in multiple findings of contempt, \nadditional plans of corrections, settlement agreements, and \nconsent orders.” United States v. Tennessee, 615 U.S. 646, 651 \n(6th Cir. 2010). The Remedial Order, the Court’s first remedy, \ncontained more than 150 requirements and 103 deadlines. The \nRemedial Order enjoined the State from admitting any additional \nresidents to Arlington except for emergency, short-term, and \ncourt-ordered admissions. The Remedial Order also called for the \n3 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 4 of 38    PageID 21558 \nappointment of a Court Monitor to oversee the State’s \nimplementation of the Court’s mandates. Nancy K. Ray, Ed.D., has \nserved as the Court Monitor since 2000, with the assistance of \nher staff at NKR & Associates, Inc., located in Delmar, New \nYork. \nIn 1997, the Court entered the Community Plan (D.E. 753). \nThe Community Plan was the result of a settlement between the \nparties after the United States filed a fourth motion for \ncontempt regarding the conditions at Arlington. Like the \nRemedial Order, the Community Plan was a detailed document that \nset forth hundreds of specific provisions to improve the quality \nof care at Arlington. The Court noted in its Order that the \nCommunity Plan “represents a paradigm shift by the State of \nTennessee in the provision of services to the developmentally \ndisabled.” (Order on Community Plan of W. Tenn. (D.E. 753) 3.) \nRelevant to the present status of this litigation is a provision \nfrom the Community Plan prohibiting the placement of class \nmembers in non-community homes. This provision applies to all \nmembers of the class, both members who were residents of \nArlington and those at risk of placement at Arlington. The \nUnited States and People First argue that the State is currently \nviolating this provision by placing class members in non-\ncommunity homes. (See United States’ Mem. of Law in Opp’n to \n4 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 5 of 38    PageID 21559 \nState’s Updated and Am. Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss (D.E. 2741) \n15.) \nIn 1999, the Court formed the Community Services Network of \nWest Tennessee, a non-profit corporation dedicated to directing \nhealth-related services provided with state funds to Arlington \nclass members. (See D.E. 1248.) In creating the Community \nServices Network, the Court interpreted the definition of “at \nrisk” class members to include all individuals in the geographic \narea served by Arlington who demonstrate medical needs \nsufficient to require institutional care. (Order Regarding Scope \nof “At-Risk” Population (D.E. 1302).) At the time, this class \ndefinition was estimated to include 800 to 1200 individuals in \nWest Tennessee. \nIn 2006, the parties reached another settlement agreement \n(2006 Settlement Agreement (D.E. 2085-1)), which the Court \napproved (see All-Party Consent Order Approving 2006 Settlement \n(D.E. 2174)). The agreement was intended “to resolve and fully \nsettle all claims arising between [the parties] in connection \nwith the appeal pending [before the Sixth Circuit] . . . , \nregarding the proper interpretation of the ‘at-risk’ portion of \nthe class definition.” (2006 Settlement Agreement 1.) The \nagreement called for the closure of Arlington and modified the \ndefinition of “at-risk” for the purposes of class membership. \nThe “at-risk” portion of class members was defined as persons \n5 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 6 of 38    PageID 21560 \nwho reside in the region served by Arlington (i.e., West \nTennessee), who meet Medicaid eligibility criteria for an \nIntermediate Care Facility for the Developmentally Disabled \n(“ICF/DD”) and demonstrate a need or desire for institutional \nplacement by: (i) residing in a nursing home or mental health \nfacility, (ii) residing in a private ICF/DD, (iii) having been \nplaced in a public ICF/DD in middle or eastern Tennessee, or \n(iv) having been hospitalized or placed in respite care and not \nbeing able to return to pre-hospitalization placement due to a \nneed for more intensive services. (2006 Settlement Agreement \n12.) \nPursuant to the 2006 Settlement Agreement, the parties \ndeveloped a plan to transition from the Community Services \nNetwork to a Medicaid-funded integrated health services delivery \nmodel that would be part of a new statewide service program for \npersons with intellectual disabilities. (See Mem. Op. (D.E. \n2517).) The plan also required all Arlington residents to be \ntransitioned to other facilities and settings. The transition \nplans for individual residents were subject to the approval of \nthe Court Monitor. On October 27, 2010, the last residents of \nArlington transitioned to new facilities, and the State closed \nArlington. \nb. Recent Procedural History  \n6 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 7 of 38    PageID 21561 \nEven before the closure of Arlington, the State moved to \nvacate the Court’s injunctive relief and dismiss the case. In \nSeptember 2008, the State filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), arguing that changes \nin law indicated that residents of Arlington were no longer \nentitled to Youngberg Rights, and, therefore, continuing the \ninjunctive relief was inequitable. The Court disagreed and \ndenied the State’s motion. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the \nCourt’s decision. United States v. Tennessee, 615 F.3d 646, 657 \n(2010). \nThe closure of Arlington in October 2010 again prompted a \ndispute over the future of this litigation. The State maintains \nthat the closure of Arlington should lead to the termination of \nthe litigation and the vacating of all outstanding orders. The \nUnited States and People First argue that despite the closure of \nArlington, the State continues to provide inadequate and \nsegregated services in violation of the substantive due process \nrights of class members and the Court’s remedial orders, and \nthus the Court’s supervision remains necessary. \nOn October 22, 2010, People First filed a Motion for an \nOrder to the State to Proceed with Enrollment of At Risk Class \nMembers (D.E. 2604), alleging that the State has failed to \nenroll hundreds of individuals who qualify as at-risk class \nmembers under the terms of the 2006 Settlement Agreement. On \n7 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 8 of 38    PageID 21562 \nNovember 3, 2010, the State filed a Motion to Vacate All \nOutstanding Injunctive Relief and Dismiss the Case (D.E. 2605). \nOn November 5, 2010, the United States filed a Motion to Enforce \nJudgment of the 2006 Settlement Agreement (D.E. 2608), seeking \nessentially the same relief as People First’s Motion for an \nOrder to the State to Proceed with Enrollment of At Risk Class \nMembers. The Court issued an Order Setting a Schedule for \nDisposition of Pending Motions (D.E. 2676) on April 4, 2011, \nafter considering a Report and Recommendation from the \nMagistrate Judge. The Court determined that the State’s Motion \nto Vacate should be decided before considering the motions of \nthe United States and People First to enroll new class members. \n(See id. at 2–3.) On June 30, 2011, the Court, with the consent \nof the parties, entered an Agreed Order Vacating in part Orders \nRelating to Conditions at Arlington Residential Units (D.E. \n2724), vacating the Court’s orders that dealt specifically with \nconditions at Arlington. Left outstanding by the Agreed Order \nwas whether the litigation would continue. On August 11, 2011, \nthe State filed an Amended Motion to Vacate All Outstanding \nOrders and to Dismiss the Case (D.E. 2737). After the Amended \nMotion was briefed by the parties, the Court conducted an \nevidentiary hearing on January 3rd and 4th, 2012. \nc. The January 2012 Hearing  \n8 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 9 of 38    PageID 21563 \nThe Court held an evidentiary hearing1 to afford the State \nan opportunity to demonstrate that vacating the Court’s orders \nand dismissing the case is warranted. The State declined to call \nany witnesses at the hearing, relying instead on the \ndeclarations and depositions it filed as exhibits to its Motion. \nFrom the State’s perspective, the issue before the Court “is \nalmost entirely legal.” (Jan. 3, 2012 Tr. (D.E. 2810) 14.) As \nthe State argued at the hearing, “the sole violation of federal \nlaw that the Court has found in this case arises from the \nconditions at the Arlington Developmental Center, and with the \nclosure of [Arlington] and the transition of all the residents \nat [Arlington] to community placements that were approved by the \nCourt Monitor, that violation has been fully and completely \nremedied.” (Id. at 15.) The State submitted that Arlington’s \nclosure and the transition of its residents to approved \nplacements is determinative of the issue. \nThe United States and People First maintain that the Court \nshould deny the State’s Motion because (1) there are ongoing \nconstitution violations, (2) the closure of Arlington is not a \nsignificant change in fact that renders the Court’s remedial \norders inequitable or unworkable, and (3) there is no durable \nremedy in place. (See id. at 38–39.) In support of their \n                     \n1 The hearing was video recorded as part of the Judicial Conference’s Cameras\nPilot Project, and is available for viewing at http://www.uscourts. \ngov/multimedia/Cameras.aspx. \n9 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 10 of 38    PageID\n 21564 \nposition, the United States and People First called three \nwitnesses at the hearing: Dr. Ray, the Court Monitor; Fred Hix, \nAssistant Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of \nIntellectual and Developmental Disabilities; and James W. \nConroy, Ph.D. The testimony is summarized as follows. \n1. Dr. Ray  \nDr. Ray testified that she has been the Court Monitor in \nthis case since 2000. (Jan. 3, 2012 Tr. 59.) Dr. Ray has a \ndoctorate in education from the State University of New York at \nAlbany and has worked in the special education field and with \npeople with developmental disabilities for decades. (Id. at 188– \n89.) As the State noted on cross-examination, Dr. Ray is not a \npsychiatrist, behavioral analyst, clinical therapist, or lawyer. \n(Id.) In accordance with her role as the Court Monitor in this \naction, Dr. Ray provided testimony regarding the services the \nState provides class members pursuant to the Court’s remedial \norders and her opinion regarding whether the State’s actions are \nin compliance with the Court’s orders. \n  A. Overview of the Class  \nDr. Ray stated that there are approximately 1030 class \nmembers currently enrolled in this action. (Id. at 200.) \nApproximately 540 of these class members reside in community \nhomes operated by private providers and funded through Medicaid. \n(Id. at 200–01.) Dr. Ray testified that based on her assessments \n10 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 11 of 38    PageID\n 21565 \nthese community service networks are performing well. (Id. at \n211–12.) Approximately 240 class members reside in Independent \nCare Facilities for people with developmental disabilities, \nreferred to as ICF/DD facilities. (Id. at 212.) There are five \nmajor ICF/DD providers serving class members. Three of these \nfive providers meet Dr. Ray’s criteria for a “quality” provider, \nbut the two ICF/DD providers serving the majority of class \nmembers do not meet Dr. Ray’s “quality tier” standards. (Id. at \n213.) Approximately 125 class members reside in nursing homes \n(id. at 206), and Dr. Ray identified serious issues with the \ncare class members receive in nursing home settings (see id. at \n62). The approximately 100 remaining class members live with \ntheir families or reside in other settings, such as mental \nhealth facilities or prisons. (Id. at 207.) \n  B. Class Members in Nursing Homes  \nThe Court admitted as Exhibit 1 a report prepared by Dr. \nRay entitled Arlington Class Members in Nursing Facilities, An \nUpdated Assessment. (Id. at 61.) Dr. Ray summarized her findings \nfrom the report, stating that “[t]he most common issue was that \nclass members in nursing homes were often not receiving \nspecialty medical consultations for diagnoses that if they had \nbeen in a community placement, they would have.” (Id. at 62.) \nDr. Ray identified several other problems regarding the services \nclass members receive in nursing homes, including: the \n11 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 12 of 38    PageID\n 21566 \nmonitoring of class members’ health statuses; the implementation \nof physicians’ orders, including administering the correct \npsychotropic medications to class members; and providing \nadequate dental care. (Id. at 62–63.) \nDr. Ray testified that her report was the fourth in a \nseries of reports she provided the State regarding the care and \nservices class members receive in nursing homes. (Id. at 63.) \nDr. Ray stated that the State has not addressed the issues she \nraised in her reports. (Id.) According to Dr. Ray, the State \ncould have made efforts to remedy the deficiencies in nursing \nhome services by asking the State health department, which has \nregulatory oversight of the nursing homes, to investigate the \nissues raised in her reports. (Id. at 63–64.) The State, \nhowever, has not done so. (Id. at 64.) Dr. Ray found the care \ndeficient in the majority of nursing homes that she reviewed. \n(Id. at 68.) \nDr. Ray testified it is her understanding that federal \nMedicaid regulations preclude people with intellectual \ndisabilities from being admitted for long-term care in nursing \nhomes. (Id. at 65.) In Tennessee, the Department of Intellectual \nand Developmental Disabilities is responsible for reviewing \nnursing home admissions to ensure individuals with developmental \ndisabilities reside in appropriate settings. (Id.) Dr. Ray \nstated that despite the State’s review process, she has \n12 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 13 of 38    PageID\n 21567 \nidentified individuals who are not residing in appropriate \nsettings. (Id. at 66.) Dr. Ray found in her report that sixty-\ntwo percent of the individuals in nursing homes were recommended \nfor alternative community placement. (Id. at 67.) Since 2008, \nhowever, only twenty-five class members have transitioned from \nnursing homes to community placements. (Id. at 68.) \nIn many cases, the class members in nursing homes do not \nhave legally appointed guardians to choose their placement. (Id.  \nat 69.) Dr. Ray stated, “when the individuals in nursing homes \nwere enrolled in the at-risk class, almost none of them had \nlegally appointed conservators, almost all of them had \ncompromised decision-making ability.” (Id.) Dr. Ray explained \nthat once an individual is enrolled as a class member, the State \nbegins the process of ensuring a legal guardian is appointed. \nDr. Ray found, however, that from a sample of thirty-seven class \nmembers, seventy-six percent were still awaiting the appointment \nof a legal conservator. (Id.) Under the Court’s Community Plan, \nall class members who are in need of a conservator are required \nto have one appointed. (Id.) The Court’s orders also require \nclass members to be assigned an independent support coordinator \nto facilitate the transitioning of individuals from \ninstitutional placements into community placements. (Id. at \n112.) Dr. Ray testified that the State has not complied with \nthis requirement. (Id.) \n13 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 14 of 38    PageID\n 21568 \nDr. Ray stated that there are not sufficient community-\nbased residential waiver providers to accommodate all the class \nmembers who currently reside in nursing homes. (Id. at 70.) \nAccordingly to Dr. Ray, “[s]omething different would have to \nhappen to make the community service system available to \nindividuals who are class members in nursing homes,” given the \nlimited number of placements in these facilities currently \navailable. (Id. at 71.) The lack of opportunities for placement \nin community settings leaves many class members without \nmeaningful choices for their care. (Id. at 72.) Because class \nmembers lack legal conservators and do not have the option of \ntransitioning to community placements, Dr. Ray asserted that \nthese class members cannot be deemed to reside in nursing homes \n“voluntarily.” (Id.) \nThe Court received, as Exhibit 2, a second report prepared \nby Dr. Ray assessing the care received by Arlington class \nmembers who reside in nursing facilities. Dr. Ray read the \nsummary of her report: \nGaps  in  provisions  of  recommended  medical  and\nnursing services were identified for 47 of the 71\nindividuals, or 66 percent. Gaps most often noted\nwith  regard  to  individuals  not  receiving\nspecialty  medical  assessments  recommended  by\ntheir  primary  care  physicians  are  apparently\nneeded due to the class members’ unstable health \ncare  status.  Other  common  gaps  were  associated\nwith  poor  health  status  tracking  or  response  to\nhealth status tracking data by nursing personnel.\nThe  most  frequent  issues  were  noted  in  tracking \n14 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 15 of 38    PageID\n 21569 \nand  responding  to  unusual  patterns  in  class \nmembers’  weights,  bowel  movements,  sleep  and \nintake, food intake. Many class members were also\nnot  regularly  being  seen  by  a  podiatrist  in \naccordance with physicians’ orders. \n \n(Id. at 76.) In addition, Dr. Ray explained that medical \ntreatment for class members is sometimes delayed or compromised \nbecause the class members lack legal conservators. (See id. at \n162.) \nIn follow-ups assessments, Dr. Ray found that the problems \nshe identified in her report were not addressed. (Id. at 76–77.) \nDr. Ray testified that her reports and the reports prepared by \nthe State’s Department of Intellectual and Developmental \nDisabilities were not being shared with the State’s Health \nDepartment, which oversees nursing home facilities. (Id. at 78.) \nDr. Ray stated that, in addition, the State does not have a \ntracking system to insure compliance with the Court’s orders for \nclass members in nursing homes. (Id. at 79.) \n  Dr. Ray testified, based on her assessments and reports on \nthe care received by class members in nursing homes, that in her \nopinion the State has not complied with the Court’s Remedial \nOrder, Community Plan, and 2006 Settlement Agreement. (Id. at \n83.) Moreover, Dr. Ray stated that the State has not made a good \nfaith effort to comply with the Court’s remedial orders. (Id.) \n    C. Class Members in ICF/DD Facilities  \n15 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 16 of 38    PageID\n 21570 \nDr. Ray testified regarding the quality of care and \nservices class members receive in ICF/DD facilities. The Court \nadmitted, as Exhibit 10, Dr. Ray’s 2011 annual review of the \nICF/DD providers. (Id. at 115.) Dr. Ray stated that the two \nprograms serving the largest number of class members, Open Arms \nCorporation and RHA West Tennessee, do not met her quality \nstandards. (Id. at 116.) As Dr. Ray explained, the Court’s \norders require the State to ensure these programs meet standards \nof care that are assessed by the Court Monitor’s assessment \ntool. (Id. at 214.) Dr. Ray stated that the State uses its own \nquality assurance monitoring tool, but she feels the scores \nbased on the State’s assessments are “inflated.” (Id. at 114.) \nIn Dr. Ray’s opinion, “the government’s role in effectively \nencouraging these ICF/DD programs to assure quality services and \nsupport, however, remains ineffective.” (Id. at 220.) \nFor Open Arms and RHA West Tennessee programs, Dr. Ray \nfound serious problems with staff competence, medication \nadministration, medical services, therapy services and \nindividual record keeping. One area of particular concern was \nthe reliance of RHA West Tennessee on the Winfrey Center to \nprovide day services. (Id. at 117.) Dr. Ray testified that the \nprogram has not been able to adequately supervise individuals at \nthe day center, protect them from harm, or provide active \ntreatment in accordance with federal and state ICF/DD \n16 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 17 of 38    PageID\n 21571 \nrequirements. (Id.) Dr. Ray has found high levels of abuse and \nneglect in the RHA West Tennessee program. (Id. at 118.) On \ncross-examination, Dr. Ray noted that there has been limited \nimprovement over the last few years in the services provided by \nOpen Arms and RHA West Tennessee. (Id. at 218.) \n  D. Violence in Community Homes  \nDr. Ray testified that another area of concern is the \nincidents of violence that occur at community homes, both \ncommunity-based residential homes and ICF/DD homes. Dr. Ray \ndescribed the findings of her report, A Review of Selected Class \nMembers Frequently Involved in Violent and Dangerous Incidents, \nadmitted as Exhibit 3. The report is one of a series Dr. Ray has \nprovided to the State and the Court detailing incidents of \nviolence involving class members residing in community \nplacements. Dr. Ray compiled the data in her reports from two of \nthe State’s Department of Intellectual and Developmental \nDisabilities data systems. (Id. at 304.) Dr. Ray testified that \nthe State does not maintain a fully electronic reporting system \nthat allows providers to electronically submit incident reports, \ncausing delays in data collection and reporting. (Id. at 322.) \nDr. Ray explained that she found a variety of violent \nincidents occurring at community homes, including physical \nassaults, verbal assaults, threats of violence, property \ndestruction, and self harm. (Id. at 84–85.) Dr. Ray testified \n17 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 18 of 38    PageID\n 21572 \nthat she has made recommendations to the State to implement \nvarious approaches to reduce the number of occurrences of \nviolent incidents in community homes. (Id. at 85.) Dr. Ray has \nrecommended improving support and training for community home \nstaff, paying more attention to the self-determination rights of \nclass members, and studying different behavior support models. \n(Id. at 85–87.) The State has only responded to one of the Court \nMonitor’s reports concerning these violent and dangerous \nincidents and has not responded to any of her recommendations. \n(Id. at 87–88.) Dr. Ray stated that, in her opinion, the State’s \nfailure to establish a comprehensive plan to mitigate the \nviolence occurring in community homes violates professional \nstandards of care. (Id. at 92–93.) \n  E. New Class Member Enrollment  \n  The United States questioned Dr. Ray regarding the State’s \nenrollment of new class members following the 2006 Settlement \nAgreement. As discussed above, the State was required by the \n2006 Settlement Agreement to enroll new class members who met \nthe “at-risk” definition agreed to in the settlement. For \nenrollment in the class, the State required an individual to \nundergo a preadmission enrollment evaluation (“PAE”), a \nrequirement of the Medicaid eligibility criteria for placement \nin an intermediate care facility. Dr. Ray testified that the PAE \nis in place as “a payment tool” and that the evaluation must be \n18 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 19 of 38    PageID\n 21573 \ncompleted in order to bill for services. (Id. at 97.) The State \ninsisted that a PAE be completed before an individual was \nenrolled as a class member. (Id. at 98.) A state agency, \nTennCare, is responsible for administering the PAE. (Id.) Dr. \nRay testified that there were significant delays – in some cases \nmore than a year – in the enrollment of class members as \nindividuals waited to receive a PAE. (Id.) \nMany individuals did not complete their PAEs prior to the \nclosure of Arlington, and, consequently, the State refused to \nenroll these individuals as class members. (Id. at 98–99.) Dr. \nRay testified that of the 170 individuals denied admission into \nthe class due to the closure of Arlington, 123 had previously \nbeen referred for a PAE after a favorable eligibility review by \nthe Joint State and Court Monitor’s Committee: twenty-six of \nthese individuals were referred for a PAE in 2010; sixty were \nreferred for a PAE in 2009; sixteen were referred for a PAE in \n2008; and for thirty-seven individuals, no specific referral \ndate was available, but the referral occurred in either 2008 or \n2009. (Id. at 100.) Dr. Ray also testified that many of the \nindividuals denied class membership because of the delays in PAE \nprocessing reside in mental health facilities operated by the \nState. (Id. at 101.) Dr. Ray stated that, in her opinion, the \ndelays in PAE processing for individuals approved for class \n19 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 20 of 38    PageID\n 21574 \nmembers was evidence of bad faith on the part of the State in \ncomplying with the 2006 Settlement Agreement. (Id. at 100.) \n  F. Arlington Woods Homes  \nAs part of the 2006 Settlement Agreement, the State agreed \nto open new ICF/DD community homes interspersed in residential \nneighborhoods. (Id. at 105.) The Court admitted, as Exhibit 9, \nan aerial photograph of Arlington and the Arlington Woods Homes, \nan ICF/DD facility opened by the State following the 2006 \nSettlement Agreement. Dr. Ray testified that the Arlington Woods \nHomes are not interspersed in a residential neighborhood and the \nhomes are not integrated into the surrounding community. (Id. at \n106–07.) Dr. Ray approved the placement of the Arlington Woods \nHomes, but testified that she was not given the opportunity to \napprove the placement before construction of the homes began. \n(Id. at 230.) Dr. Ray stated that she “felt snookered by the \nState . . . in terms of the location of the homes and that they \nhadn’t been forthcoming in telling me about that until the homes \nwere already underway.” (Id. at 230–31.) Dr. Ray ultimately \napproved the location of the homes, but did not feel “the State \nmade a good faith effort in disclosing where these homes were \ngoing to be.” (Id. at 231.) Based on the location of the \nArlington Woods Homes, Dr. Ray stated that she did not believe \nthe State made a reasonable effort to comply with the 2006 \n20 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 21 of 38    PageID\n 21575 \nSettlement Agreement’s requirement that ICF/DD homes be \ninterspersed in residential neighborhoods. (Id. at 107.) \n  G. Ending the Court’s Supervision  \nDr. Ray testified that there are priorities she could \nidentify to help bring this case to a completion. (Id. at 143.) \nDr. Ray stated that she believes “the parties would need to make \nsome compromises in terms of identifying a relatively small set \nof exit criteria that need to be achieved” so that the Court’s \nsupervision could end. (Id.) Dr. Ray stated that she was willing \nto participate in a mediation with the parties to establish an \nappropriate “exit criteria.” (Id. at 144.) Dr. Ray testified \nthat she believes that “assuming good faith efforts,” the State \ncould resolve the outstanding issues regarding compliance \n“within a year or two.” (Id. at 150.) \n2. Fred Hix  \nThe United States called Fred Hix as its second witness. \n(Jan. 4, 2012 Tr. (D.E. 2811) 379.) Mr. Hix explained that he is \nthe “business manager for the Department of Intellectual and \nDevelopmental Disabilities holding the working title of \nAssistant Commissioner for Administration.” (Id.) Mr. Hix \ntestified as to the financial costs of implementing the \ngoverning orders in this case. The State’s position is that the \norders in this case require the State to spend substantially \nmore money providing services to Arlington class members than \n21 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 22 of 38    PageID\n 21576 \nfor identically situated non-class members with intellectual \ndisabilities in the statewide waivers. (See Decl. of James M. \nHenry (D.E. 2737-2) 4.) Mr. Hix admitted, however, that his \nanalysis of the costs associated with class members versus non-\nclass members did not compare individuals with similar \ndisabilities. (See Jan. 4, 2012 Tr. 383–84.) For instance, while \nsixty-five percent of individuals in the state-wide waiver \nprogram are entitled to receive residential services based on \ntheir disabilities, one hundred percent of Arlington class \nmembers are entitled to residential services. (Id.) Mr. Hix’s \nstudy comparing the cost of waivers for Arlington class members \nwith the cost of the state-wide waivers did not account for \nthese differences in need levels that exist between the two \ngroups. (See id. at 389–90, 395.) \n3. James W. Conroy  \nPeople First called James W. Conroy, Ph.D., as its witness. \nDr. Conroy stated that he has a doctorate in medical sociology \nwith a specialization in health economics from Temple \nUniversity. (Id. at 410.) Dr. Conroy stated that he has \ntestified as an expert on behalf of states seeking to end the \nsupervision of federal district courts in litigations regarding \nstate services for individuals with disabilities. (Id.) In those \ncases, Dr. Conroy collected data and prepared reports concerning \nimprovements to the class members’ quality of life. (See id. at \n22 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 23 of 38    PageID\n 21577 \n419–21.) The Court received Dr. Conroy as an expert witness in \nthe field of medical sociology, specifically in the field of \nintellectual and developmental disabilities and cost outcome \nevaluation. (Id. at 422–23.) \nDr. Conroy disagreed with the State’s analysis that it \nspends more on Arlington class members than on similarly \nsituated non-class members. (Id. at 425.) Dr. Conroy stated that \nthe Arlington class members do not have similar characteristics \nas the average waiver recipient. (Id.) According to Dr. Conroy, \n“what we have here is pure apples and oranges, that the folks \ncoming out of Arlington do cost more, and I think they should \ncost more, and what’s dictated, what’s prescribed in their ISPs \nis the ultimate determinative cost.” (Id. at 441.) To do a valid \ncomparison, Dr. Conroy stated the State would need to conduct a \n“twin study” comparing Arlington class members and non-class \nmembers with similar levels of need based on similar \ndisabilities. (Id. at 441–42.) \nDr. Conroy noted the improvements the State has made in \nproviding services for persons with disabilities. Dr. Conroy \nstated, “Tennessee has come so far in 30 years, so far forward \nin supporting people with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities, it’s most commendable and exciting really.” (Id.  \nat 445.) Dr. Conroy stated that in his experience, courts have \nplayed a significant role in ensuring adequate services for \n23 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 24 of 38    PageID\n 21578 \npeople with disabilities. (Id. at 458.) Dr. Conroy acknowledged, \n“there comes a day when the human service system can’t be run by \ncourts,” however, “in order to be sure about the folks we have \nworked so hard for two decades to get a better life for, we want \nto make sure there are some guaranties [sic] and protections.” \n(Id. at 458–59.) \nd. Post Hearing Activity  \nAt the January hearing, the Court granted the State leave \nto submit evidence in support of its Motion. (See Jan 4, 2012 \nTr. 396.) The Court also indicated it was willing to reconvene \nto allow the State to present fact witnesses or expert \ntestimony. (Id. at 397.) The State submitted three affidavits: \n(1) a declaration of Fred Hix concerning whether the State has \never employed Dr. Ray on matters besides the Arlington case; (2) \na declaration of C.J. McMorran, the West Tennessee Regional \nDirector for the Department of Intellectual and Developmental \nDisabilities, rebutting several contentions made by Dr. Ray \nduring her testimony; and (3) a declaration of Scott J. Modell, \nDeputy Commissioner of the Department of Intellectual and \nDevelopmental Disabilities, regarding the State’s effort to \ncreate an electronic incident report system. (D.E. 2819.) The \nUnited States filed a Motion to Strike these affidavits (D.E. \n2861), but the Court denied the motion. The State declined the \nCourt’s invitation to present any witnesses or expert testimony. \n24 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 25 of 38    PageID\n 21579 \nThe State filed a Motion to Strike Court Monitor’s \nTestimony and Reports (D.E. 2817.), which the Court denied. West \nParent Guardian Association file a motion for leave to file \ndocuments (D.E. 2862), and the Court denied this motion as well. \nThe Court permitted the parties to submit closing briefs on the \nState’s Motion, and on June 18, 2012, the Court heard the \nparties’ final arguments.2 (D.E. 2890.) \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n  The parties disagree as to the proper standard the Court \nshould apply in evaluating the State’s Motion to Vacate and \nDismiss. The State asserts that “the question before the Court \nis governed by first principles that the Supreme Court has \nannounced” in Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431 (2004), and Horne v. \nFlores, 129 S. Ct. 2579 (2009). (June 18, 2012 Tr. (D.E. 2895) \n8.) Frew and Horne caution that in institutional reform \nlitigation, such as the case at bar, “courts [should] ensure \nthat ‘responsibility for discharging the State’s obligations is \nreturned promptly to the State and its officials’ when the \ncircumstances warrant.” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2595 (quoting Frew, \n540 U.S. at 442). The United States and People First, while \nacknowledging the applicability of Frew and Horne to the Court’s \nanalysis, maintain that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) \n                     \n2 The parties final arguments were recorded as part of the Judicial\nConference’s Cameras Pilot Project, and is available for viewing at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/multimedia/Cameras.aspx. \n25 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 26 of 38    PageID\n 21580 \ngoverns the State’s motion. The United States and People First \npoint out that the State seeks relief from the Court’s remedial \norders and a Rule 60 motion is the proper vehicle under the \nFederal Rules to seek such relief. \n  The Court agrees with the United States and People First \nthat the State’s Motion should be evaluated under Rule 60(b). \nIndeed, the Supreme Court’s analysis in Frew and Horne proceeded \nunder Rule 60(b). See Frew, 540 U.S. at 441; Horne, 129 S.Ct. at \n2593. While the Supreme Court’s directives in Frew and Horne are \ncertainly relevant in the Court’s consideration of the State’s \nMotion, those directives must be viewed in the Rule 60(b) \ncontext. Accordingly, because the State’s Motion seeks relief \nfrom the Court’s remedial orders, the Court will evaluate the \nMotion pursuant to Rule 60(b). \n  Rule 60(b) states that the court may relieve a party from a \nfinal judgment, order, or proceeding when “the judgment has been \nsatisfied, released or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it \nprospectively is no longer equitable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). \nThe Supreme Court has explained that the rule “provides a means \nby which a party can ask a court to modify or vacate a judgment \nor order if ‘a significant change either in factual conditions \nor in law’ renders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the \npublic interest.’” Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2593 (quoting Rufo v. \n26 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 27 of 38    PageID\n 21581 \nInmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 384 (1992)). “The \nparty seeking relief bears the burden of establishing that \nchanged circumstances warrant relief.” Id. This burden is \nheightened when the change in conditions was anticipated by the \nparty challenging the decree: \nIf it is clear that a party anticipated changing\nconditions . . . but nevertheless agreed to the\ndecree, that party would have to satisfy a heavy\nburden to convince a court that it agreed to the\ndecree in good faith, made a reasonable effort to\ncomply with the decree, and should be relieved of\nthe undertaking under Rule 60(b). \n \nRufo, 502 U.S. at 385. “[O]nce a party carries this burden,” \nhowever, “a court abuses its discretion ‘when it refuses to \nmodify an injunction or consent decree in light of such \nchanges.’” Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2593 (quoting Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 215 (1997)). \nThe Supreme Court set forth further guidance in Horne for \ncourts to follow in applying Rule 60(b)(5) to “institutional \nreform litigation.” The Court noted, “injunctions issued in such \ncases often remain in force for many years, and the passage of \ntime frequently brings about changed circumstances — changes in \nthe nature of the underlying problem . . . — that warrant \nreexamination of the original judgment.” Id. In addition, \n“institutional reform injunctions often raise sensitive \nfederalism concerns,” and these concerns “are heightened when, \nas in these cases, a federal court decree has the effect of \n27 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 28 of 38    PageID\n 21582 \ndictating state or local budget priorities.” Id. at 2593–94. In \nsum, the Court instructed: \nIt  goes  without  saying  that  federal  courts  must\nvigilantly  enforce  federal  law  and  must  not \nhesitate  in  awarding  necessary  relief.  But  in\nrecognition  of  the  features  of  institutional \nreform  decrees,  we  have  held  that  courts  must\ntake  a  “flexible  approach”  to  Rule  60(b)(5)\nmotions  addressing  such  decrees.  Rufo,  502  U.S.\nat  381.  A  flexible  approach  allows  courts  to\nensure  that  “responsibility  for  discharging  the\nState’s  obligations  is  returned  promptly  to  the\nState  and  its  officials”  when  the  circumstances \nwarrant.  Frew,  [540  U.S.]  at  442.  In  applying\nthis  flexible  approach,  courts  must  remain \nattentive to the fact that “federal-court decrees \nexceed  appropriate  limits  if  they  are  aimed  at \neliminating  a  condition  that  does  not  violate\n[federal  law]  or  does  not  flow  from  such  a \nviolation.”  Milliken  v.  Bradley,  433  U.S.  267,\n282 (1977). “If [a federal consent decree is] not\nlimited  to  reasonable  and  necessary\nimplementations  of  federal  law,”  it  may\n“improperly  deprive  future  officials  of  their \ndesignated  legislative  and  executive  powers.”\nFrew, [540 U.S.] at 441. \n \nId. at 2594–95. \n  For the reasons noted above, the Court in Horne concluded, \n“a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether \nthe objective of the District Court’s . . .  order . . . has \nbeen achieved. If a durable remedy has been implemented, \ncontinued enforcement of the order is not only unnecessary, but \nimproper.” Id. at 2595. \nIII. ANALYSIS   \n28 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 29 of 38    PageID\n 21583 \n  The Court finds that the State has not met its burden in \nshowing that relief from the Court’s remedial orders and \ndismissal of the case is warranted under Rule 60(b). The State \nhas not demonstrated that the Court’s judgment and orders have \n“been satisfied . . . or that applying [them] prospectively is \nno longer equitable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). The Court is not \npersuaded that the objective of the Court’s remedial orders has \nbeen achieved and a durable remedy is in place. See Horne, 129 \nS. Ct. at 2595. Moreover, because the closure of Arlington was \nanticipated by the parties when executing the 2006 Settlement \nAgreement, the State has a “heavy burden” to demonstrate it \nagreed to the settlement in good faith, made a reasonable effort \nto comply with the terms of the settlement, and should be \nrelieved of the undertaking under Rule 60(b). See Rufo, 502 U.S. \nat 385. The State has not satisfied this burden. \n  The State’s submission rests almost entirely on the fact \nthat Arlington has closed and its residents have transferred to \nplacements approved by the Court Monitor pursuant to the 2006 \nSettlement Agreement. Indeed, the State did not attempt to \ndemonstrate that it is in full or even substantial compliance \nwith the Court’s remedial orders as contemplated by provision \nXVIV, “Jurisdiction and Enforcement,” of the Remedial Order. \n(See Remedial Order (D.E. 338) 54.) Based on the State’s \n29 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 30 of 38    PageID\n 21584 \nshowing, the Court cannot find that its orders have been \nsatisfied under Rule 60(b)(5). \n  The State has also failed to show that applying the Court’s \norders prospectively is no longer equitable. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(5). The State submitted affidavits stating that the orders \nin this case require it to spend substantially more money \nproviding services to Arlington class members than for \nidentically situated non-class members with intellectual \ndisabilities in the statewide waiver program. The testimony of \nFred Hix, however, established that the State’s study did not \ncompare class members and non-class members with similar \ndisabilities and ISP requirements. As Dr. Conroy testified, the \nState conducted an “apples to oranges” comparison in its cost \nstudy. The Court is therefore not persuaded by the State’s \nshowing that the remedial orders in this case create disparities \nin funding and care between class members and non-class members \nsuch that applying the orders prospectively is no longer \nequitable. \n  The crux of the State’s argument is that the closure of \nArlington and transition of the center’s residents to new \nplacements achieves the objectives of the Court’s remedial \norders and represents a durable remedy against future \nconstitutional violations, satisfying the standards set forth in \nHorne. The Court agrees that Arlington’s closure represents a \n30 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 31 of 38    PageID\n 21585 \nsignificant milestone in this litigation, but is not convinced \nthat the objective of its remedial orders, namely to protect the \nconstitutional rights of class members, has been fully achieved \nand a durable remedy is in place. As the United States and \nPeople First point out, this litigation is the combination of \ntwo civil actions. Although the case arose from the \nunconstitutional violations found to have existed at Arlington, \nthe Court included in the plaintiff class both residents of \nArlington and those “at risk” of placement in Arlington. The \nremedial orders of this Court, including the orders agreed to by \nthe State, have sought to ensure the constitutional rights of \nall class members, not just the rights of the residents of \nArlington. The Court stated in its Order on Community Plan for \nWest Tennessee (D.E. 753) that “it is beyond dispute that the \nprotections of the Remedial Order extend to all members of the \nclass.” (Id. at 5.) The State now seeks to vacate the \nprotections afforded “at-risk” class members, not because the \nconstitutional rights of these class members have been \nvindicated, but because Arlington has closed. The closure of \nArlington, however, does not end the State’s obligation to class \nmembers in this action. Nevertheless, the State failed to \npresent evidence regarding the steps it has taken to protect the \nrights of class members and ensure that those rights will be \nprotected in the future. \n31 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 32 of 38    PageID\n 21586 \n  Dr. Ray provided testimony that raises serious concerns \nabout the care and services class members receive. The State may \ndisagree about the conclusions Dr. Ray reached in her testimony \nand reports, but it did not provide fact or expert witness \ntestimony to rebut Dr. Ray’s contentions. As the Remedial Order \ncontemplates, it is the Court Monitor’s role to “conduct a \nreview of the [State’s] compliance” and report these findings to \nthe Court. (Remedial Order 53 (setting forth the procedure for \nthe State to petition the Court for termination of the Remedial \nOrder).) If the State disagreed with Dr. Ray’s assessments of \nits compliance with the Court’s remedial orders, it could have \npresented testimony from its own fact witnesses and experts to \nsupport a finding of compliance. The State chose not to make \nsuch a showing despite the Court providing ample opportunity to \ndo so. \n  One particular area of concern raised by Dr. Ray’s \ntestimony is the care class members in nursing homes receive. \nThe State maintains that this evidence is not relevant to the \nCourt’s analysis because it is not responsible “for this state \nof affairs.” (See Defs.’ Closing Br. (D.E. 2867) 6.) The State \nignores the mandate of this Court that it provide community \nplacements for class members for whom such a placement is \nappropriate. The State is also required to ensure class members \nhave legal conservators and independent support coordinators. \n32 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 33 of 38    PageID\n 21587 \nThe State cannot credibly claim that class members are residing \nin nursing facilities “voluntarily” when class members do not \nhave legal conservators and independent support coordinators. \nThat class members receive appropriate placements based on their \nindividualized needs has long been a goal of this litigation \n(see, e.g., Remedial Order 42–47); the State has not \ndemonstrated that this goal has been achieved. Moreover, the \nCourt cannot find that a durable remedy is in place to ensure \nthe appropriate placement of class members when class members \nlack legal conservators and independent support coordinators. \n  Dr. Ray’s testimony also raised concerns about the \nfrequency of dangerous and violent incidents occurring in \ncommunity homes. Again, the State disagrees with the findings \npresented by Dr. Ray in her testimony and reports. The State, \nhowever, did not present any evidence to rebut Dr. Ray’s \nfindings and did not demonstrate that it has ensured class \nmembers in community placements are and will be reasonably free \nfrom harm. The lack of a streamlined and electronic incident \nreporting system is another concern. While the State appears to \nbe taking steps to establish such a system (see Decl. of Scott \nJ. Modell (D.E. 2819-3) at 2–3), the Court cannot conclude that \nthe State has a durable remedy in place to ensure class member \nsafety without an adequate reporting system in place. \n33 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 34 of 38    PageID\n 21588 \n  The closure of Arlington and the transition of its \nresidents to approved placements were contemplated by the \nparties at the time they executed the 2006 Settlement Agreement.3  \nThe State has fulfilled its obligation to close Arlington and \ntransition the center’s residents to appropriate settings, but \nnow seeks relief from the remainder of its obligations under the \n2006 Settlement Agreement. Under the standard articulated by the \nSupreme Court in Rufo, the State must meet a heavy burden to \nshow that it agreed to the settlement in good faith, made a \nreasonable effort to comply with the settlement, and should be \nrelieved of the undertaking under Rule 60(b). 502 U.S. at 385. \nThe State has not met this burden. \n  The State did not put forth any evidence regarding its \nreasonable efforts to comply with the terms of the 2006 \nSettlement Agreement. On the other hand, Dr. Ray’s testimony \nraised questions about the State’s good faith attempts to meet \nthe requirements of the settlement. For instance, Dr. Ray \ntestified that although she ultimately approved the location of \nthe Arlington Woods Homes, she did so only after construction \nhad begun. Dr. Ray’s testimony and the aerial photograph \nadmitted into evidence raises doubts as to whether the homes are \n                     \n3 “Whereas, the State has made the policy decision to close the Arlington\nDevelopmental Center and to provide services to persons currently residing in\n[Arlington] in a more integrated setting . . . .” (2006 Settlement Agreement\n1.) \n34 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 35 of 38    PageID\n 21589 \ntruly interspersed in a residential neighborhood as required by \nthe 2006 Settlement Agreement. \n  Dr. Ray also testified that many potential class members \nhave not been enrolled in the class because of delays in the \nState’s administration of PAEs. The Court need not decide for \nthe purposes of ruling on the State’s Motion whether a PAE is \nrequired under the 2006 Settlement Agreement for class \nmembership. Under Rufo, the State has the burden to demonstrate \nit made a reasonable effort to comply with the settlement \nagreement. The Court cannot find that the State made a \nreasonable effort to enroll new class members as required by the \nparties’ agreement when many potential class members were denied \nadmission solely because a State agency failed to timely \nadminister an examination the State insisted individuals undergo \nprior to class enrollment. The State offered no reasonable \nexplanation as to why potential class members waited years to \nreceive their PAEs. \n  Provision VI of the 2006 Settlement Agreement requires that \n“the community-based services currently provided be improved and \nbe consistent with reasoned professional judgment and that the \nnew community-based services made necessary by the closure of \n[Arlington] be effective, constitutional, and in compliance with \nstatutory standards.” (2006 Settlement Agreement 6.) The \nprovision lists nine subparts setting forth specific \n35 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 36 of 38    PageID\n 21590 \nrequirements for the State to improve services for class members \nin community placements. Again, the State put forth no evidence \nthat it has made a reasonable effort to comply with these \nrequirements. The testimony of Dr. Ray, however, raises serious \ndoubts about the State’s compliance with these requirements. \n  The parties entered into the 2006 Settlement Agreement to \nresolve several contentious issues in this case, including the \nissue of defining the “at risk” class member criteria. The \nUnited States and People First entered into this agreement in \ngood faith. The State, however, now seeks release from the terms \nof the agreement short of full compliance. The State has not \ncarried its “heavy burden” under Rufo to demonstrate that such \nrelief is warranted. The 2006 Settlement Agreement made clear \nthat the closure of Arlington and transition of its residents to \ncommunity placements would not end the State’s responsibilities \nin this action. Indeed, the State agreed in the 2006 Settlement \nAgreement to take many additional steps to ensure the adequacy \nof the care class members receive, and the State has failed to \narticulate a compelling reason why it should not be held to the \nterms of its agreement. \nThe Court is mindful of the concerns raised by \ninstitutional reform litigations outlined by the Supreme Court \nin Horne. See 129 S. Ct. 2593–95. As the Supreme Court noted, \ncourts must take a “flexible approach” in recognition of these \n36 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 37 of 38    PageID\n 21591 \nconcerns. See id. at 2594. The Court has already vacated its \norders relating to the conditions at Arlington in response to \nthe center’s closure. (See D.E. 2724.) The Court Monitor, the \nUnited States, and People First all indicated that they believe \nthe State can achieve compliance with the remaining orders of \nthe Court within a period of one to two years. In addition, the \nUnited States and People First have indicated their willingness \nto engage in mediation with the State to develop an “exit \ncriteria” to bring this case to a close. Indeed, the 2006 \nSettlement Agreement required the parties, in conjunction with \nthe Court Monitor, “to enter into good faith discussions to \ndevelop objective and measurable exit criteria for the dismissal \nof this action.” (2006 Settlement Agreement 13.) It appears that \nthese discussions never occurred. The Court believes that taking \na “flexible approach” to the outstanding issues in this \nlitigation warrants mediation between the parties to develop \n“objective and measureable exit criteria” that will allow the \nState to demonstrate that the objective of the Court’s orders \nhas been achieved and a durable remedy is in place. \nIV. CONCLUSION   \n  For the foregoing reasons, the State’s Amended Motion to \nVacate All Outstanding Orders and Dismiss the Case is DENIED. \nThe parties are ordered within ninety (90) days of the entry of \nthis Order to complete mediation with the Magistrate Judge to \n37 \n\n \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2901   Filed 09/04/12   Page 38 of 38    PageID\n 21592 \ndevelop “objective and measurable exit criteria for the \ndismissal of this action.” The first mediation session with the \nMagistrate Judge shall occur within thirty (30) days of entry of \nthis Order and at other times as designated by the Magistrate \nJudge. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED this 4th day of September, 2012. \n \n_s/ Jon P.

The \nReport recommends that Defendants’ motion to suspend activity by the Court Monitor’s \nOffice filed June 26, 2009 (D.E. #2429) be denied.  Defendants filed objections to the \nReport on February 25, 2010, and Plaintiff United States of America (“United States”) \nresponded to Defendants’ objections on March 4, 2010.  For the reasons stated below, the \n                                                 \n1 Defendants’ motion when originally filed also sought further discovery in support of their request to \nsuspend the Court Monitor.  The Magistrate Judge previously determined that aspect of Defendants’ motion \nby separate order—a ruling which no party appealed.   \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2572   Filed 03/23/10   Page 2 of 6    PageID 16728\nCourt OVERRULES Defendants’ objections, ADOPTS the proposed findings of fact \nand conclusions of law contained in the Magistrate Judge’s thorough and well-reasoned \nReport, and DENIES Defendants’ motion.   \nI. BACKGROUND2 \n  In 1992, the United States filed the instant suit against the State of Tennessee \n(“State”)  and  others  because  of  unconstitutional  conditions  at  the  Arlington \nDevelopmental Center (“ADC”), a state-run facility for mentally retarded individuals.  \nSee United States v. State of Tennessee, 925 F. Supp. 1292, 1296 (W.D. Tenn. 1995).  \nFollowing  trial,  the  Court  found  that  conditions  at  ADC  violated  the  rights  of  its \nresidents.  The parties then negotiated and the Court approved the Remedial Order, which \nwas crafted to address the violations found by the Court.  Among its many provisions, the \nRemedial Order called for the appointment of a Court Monitor to be responsible for \nensuring the State’s compliance with the Remedial Order’s terms.  On December 13, \n2000, Dr. Nancy K. Ray (“Dr. Ray”) replaced Dr. Linda R. O’Neall as the Court Monitor, \nand Dr. Ray has served in that position ever since.  \n  The present controversy arises from allegations by Defendants that Dr. Ray has \nengaged in misconduct suggesting that Dr. Ray has taken sides in this case against \nDefendants and that she can therefore no longer be considered a neutral agent of the \nCourt.  Defendants base their allegations on e-mail communications among Dr. Ray, \ncounsel  for  Intervenor  People  First  (“People  First”),  and  others.    More  specifically, \nDefendants contend that these e-mail exchanges reveal that Dr. Ray has (1) recently \nencouraged People First to take certain positions in this litigation to challenge actions by \n                                                 \n2 The Court adopts in full and incorporates herein by reference the proposed findings of fact contained in \nthe Magistrate Judge’s Report, but the Court includes the following background summary to provide \ncontext for this order’s discussion of Defendants’ objections.   \n  2\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2572   Filed 03/23/10   Page 3 of 6    PageID 16729\nthe State; (2) assisted People First in formulating its positions, including by forwarding \nPeople First information from the State; (3) referred or attempted to refer prospective \nclients to People First; and (4) received assistance from People First in drafting a letter to \nthe Court, which eventually gave rise to a motion for contempt filed by People First.  In \nhis Report of February 16, 2010, after carefully discussing each of the allegations made \nagainst Dr. Ray, the Magistrate Judge recommended finding that Dr. Ray’s actions were \nnot improper and thus that Defendants’ motion be denied.  Defendants timely filed \nobjections to the Report.  \nII. DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS TO REPORT  \n  Defendants  do  not  challenge  any  of  the  Report’s  proposed  findings  of  fact.  \nInstead, the objections interposed by Defendants are limited to the Report’s proposed \nconclusions of law.3  \nA. Standard for Evaluating Dr. Ray’s Actions \n  Defendants  first  argue  that  the  Magistrate  Judge  applied  the  incorrect  legal \nstandard in evaluating Dr. Ray’s actions.  According to Defendants, Dr. Ray is subject to \nthe standard found under 28 U.S.C. § 455 for judicial officers, which requires, inter alia, \ndisqualification of any judicial officer in a proceeding in which her “impartiality might \nreasonably be questioned.”  28 U.S.C. § 455(a).  This is an objective standard that asks \n“whether  another  person  with  knowledge  of  all  the  circumstances  might  reasonably \nquestion the judge’s impartiality.”  Conway v. Vergos, 297 B.R. 116, 121 (W.D. Tenn. \n                                                 \n3 The Court notes that part of the Report’s proposed findings of fact recounts and relies upon Dr. Ray’s \ntestimony in the District Court during the hearing of July 6 through 9, 2009.  In that testimony, Dr. Ray \nexplained the reasons for each of her actions.  The Court credits Dr. Ray’s testimony and the explanations \nshe provided for proceeding as she did.     \n  3\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2572   Filed 03/23/10   Page 4 of 6    PageID 16730\n2003).  The standard established by § 455(a) extends to special masters under Rule 53 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(a)(2).   \n  The Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge’s Report that Dr. Ray should not be \nheld to the “appearance of partiality” standard of § 455(a).  She is not acting as a judicial \nofficer, nor—as the Report’s analysis explains—does Dr. Ray have the powers and duties \nof a special master.  Rather, the Court agrees with the Report that a more liberal standard \nshould be applied to review of Dr. Ray’s activities.  That standard, roughly articulated, is \nwhether the Court Monitor has ceased to act as a neutral agent of the Court.  As the \nReport notes, the fact that Dr. Ray is tasked with policing the State’s compliance with the \nCourt’s orders necessarily means that her actions will often appear adversarial to the \nState and thus more aligned with the interests of the State’s opponents in this case—the \nUnited States and People First.  Moreover, the Remedial Order expressly contemplates \nthat  the  Court  Monitor  will  engage  in  ex  parte  communications  and  other  informal \ncontact that would generally be inappropriate for a judge or special master.  \n  Defendants cite two cases, which, they argue, demand a more stringent standard.  \nThe Court agrees with the United States, however, that these cases differ from the present \naction in significant respects.  One of those cases, Edgar v. K.L., 93 F.3d 256 (7th Cir. \n1996), involved court-appointed experts whose ex parte contacts with the judge prior to \ntrial necessitated his recusal under § 455 and removal of the experts from their judicial \nappointment under Federal Rule of Evidence 706.  Edgar, 93 F.3d at 261; see Fed. R. \nEvid. 706(a) (“The court may on its own motion or on the motion of any party enter an \norder to show cause why expert witnesses should not be appointed, and may request the \nparties to submit nominations. The court may appoint any expert witnesses agreed upon \n  4\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2572   Filed 03/23/10   Page 5 of 6    PageID 16731\nby the parties, and may appoint expert witnesses of its own selection.”).  Indeed, the issue \nin Edgar largely centered on the effect of the contacts on the judge rather than their effect \non the experts.  In the instant case, however, the Court Monitor is expressly permitted \ncertain ex parte contact with the Court and the parties.  Defendants also cite an order \nfrom United States v. City of Detroit, Case No. 03-72258 (E.D. Mich.) (Order of July 24, \n2009).  This order does not state what standard should be applied in evaluating the \nactions  of  a  court  monitor,  but  simply  concludes  that  the  court  should  accept  the \nresignation of its monitor because she had engaged in conduct that the court found \n“totally inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the two Consent Judgments in this \nlitigation.”4  Id. at 1.  Even if Dr. Ray’s communications with People First in this case \nwere unwise, they can hardly be deemed “totally inconsistent” with her duties.   \nHaving found error neither in the Magistrate Judge’s legal standard nor in his \napplication of that standard to the facts, the Court finds Defendants’ remaining objections \nto be moot.   \nB. Future Guidance \n  In the alternative, Defendants ask the Court to provide guidance going forward as \nto what standards should govern the Court Monitor’s conduct.  The Report likewise \nrecommends that the parties consider amending the Remedial Order to more clearly \ndefine the Court Monitor’s duties and her limitations.  Defendants’ request for greater \nclarification is not without merit, but the Court finds that it should not issue those \ndirectives on its own at this time without the benefit of consultation with the parties.  If \nthe parties desire to jointly clarify the parameters of the Court Monitor’s duties and any \n                                                 \n4 The order in the City of Detroit case is far from detailed in describing what the monitor’s misconduct \nentailed and what provisions of the court’s orders she violated.   \n  5\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2572   Filed 03/23/10   Page 6 of 6    PageID 16732\nrestrictions on her activities and then submit those proposals to the Court, the Court is \ncertainly  willing  to  consider  them  as  possible  modifications  or  amendments  to  the \nRemedial Order.     \nThe expenditure of too much energy and effort on such a project, however, should \nbe avoided.  Just as this case must someday end, the office of Court Monitor was never \nintended to continue indefinitely.  It is the Court’s hope, and presumably the hope of the \nparties, that there will soon come a point in this litigation when the services of a court \nmonitor will be unnecessary because the State has satisfactorily established its ability to \ncomply with its legal obligations without the extensive monitoring currently in place.  \nThat day has not yet arrived, but the State will surely hasten its arrival if it accomplishes \nthe orderly closure of ADC and the creation of an effective and reliable network of \nservices for mentally disabled individuals in West Tennessee.5   \nIII. CONCLUSION \n  After considering the Report, Defendants’ objections, the response of the United \nStates,  and  all  relevant  filings  made  of  record,  the  Court  ADOPTS  the  Magistrate \nJudge’s Report and Recommendation as the opinion of the Court.  Defendants’ objections \nare OVERRULED, and Defendants’ motion is DENIED.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 23rd day of March, 2010. \n \ns/Bernice Bouie Donald \nBERNICE BOUIE DONALD \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                                                 \n5 Furthermore, the State might consider a role for local ombudsmen to ensure quality and assist in resolving \nproblems that may arise regarding the scope or nature of the services the State provides.    \n  6",

      "text": "Memorandum  uc\nuT\nU.S. v. Tennessee\nAEP: BPS: SGB: eh  MR-TN-003-001\nDJ  168-72-30\nDate\nSubject\nJustification for Proceeding on a\nFast Track in the S. 10 JUN 18 B90\nInvestigation of the Arlington\nDevelopmental Center\n  John R. Dunne   Arthur E. Peabody,\nTo   From\nAssistant Attorney General  Chief  \"5\nCivil Rights Division  Special Litigation Section\nAttached is our recommendation for initiating an\ninvestigation into the conditions of confinement at Arlington\nDevelopmental Center (Arlington), Arlington, Tennessee, pursuant\nto the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act  (CRIPA), 42\nU.S.C. §1997 et seq.  Arlington is a residential facility for the\nmentally retarded operated by the Tennessee Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation.  As set forth in this memorandum\nand the attached recommendation, we have received information\nthat some State officials are involved in an attempt to cover up\nconditions at Arlington and that there may be destruction or\nmodification of records and/or retaliation against employees once\nthe Governor receives notice of our proposed investigation.\nWe were informed by the United States Attorney for the\nWestern District of Tennessee, W. Hickman Ewing, Jr., that\nTennessee State Representative David Shirley had requested his\nassistance concerning possible mistreatment and abuse of\nresidents at Arlington.  Representative Shirley related that he\nhad received a number of complaints from employees and parents\nof residents alleging such mistreatment and abuse.  He initially\nresponded to those complaints by requesting a meeting with the\nCommissioner of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, Eric\nTaylor.  In July 1989, Representative Shirley and a number of\nemployees met with Mr. Taylor to discuss conditions at Arlington\nthat, the employees alleged, included physical abuse of residents\nby developmental technicians  (DTs), health violations, and\nretaliation against those who reported such conditions.\nRepresentative Shirley related that Mr. Taylor was displeased\nthat the employees had complained to the legislature and did\nnot provide any assurances that he would follow up on the issues\nbrought to his attention.  Because further meetings with\nMr. Taylor did not appear fruitful, Representative Shirley\narranged for a meeting with Governor Ned McWherter.  On\nSeptember 26, 1989, the Representative, a number of employees,\nand one parent met with the Governor concerning the allegations.\n\n- 2 -\nRepresentative Shirley reported that Governor McWherter stated\nthat he would not get involved and made other comments suggesting\nefforts to inappropriately keep the matter quiet and outside\npublic purview.  United States Attorney Ewing has counseled us to\nproceed quickly in a manner which would preclude destruction of\nrecords and any actions by institutional officials to \"gag\" the\nemployees or frustrate the investigation.\nBecause of these allegations, we have modified the notice\nletter to the Governor and State officials to include a reference\nto the CRIPA provision prohibiting retaliation, 42 U.S.C. §1997d,\nand have requested the Governor's cooperation in preserving\nfacility records.  Additionally, we would like to place this case\non a fast track for investigation and to tour the facility as\nsoon as is statutorily permissible, i.e.. arrange for a tour\nimmediately following the expiration of the seven day notice\nrequirement. 42 U.S.C. §1997b(a)(2).  In order to proceed in this\nmanner, we suggest delaying the issuance of the letter until we\nhave arranged for all experts to be available for the estimated\nfive day tour within that timeframe.  This procedure will permit\nus to organize tours and other investigatory activities to\ncommence as soon as statutory requirements permit.\nIt is possible that we will meet with some resistance from\nthe State concerning this approach and that there will be an\nattempt to deny us access to the facility within such a short\ntimeframe.  Therefore, before sending the notice letter, we\nintend to prepare pleadings requesting the district court to\ndirect the State to grant us immediate access to the facility in\norder that we may fulfill our statutory obligations and conduct\nour investigation.  We would like your approval to file the\naccess suit if access is denied.  We have filed two such actions\nin the past, with favorable results.  See, e.g.. United States v.\nCounty of Los Angeles. 635 F.Supp. 588 (C.D.Cal. 1986).\nThe alleged facts regarding Arlington are among the most\nflagrant and egregious we have received in recent years.  As\nsuch, the steps outlined here are merited.\nPlease advise.\nAttachments\nApproved:\nDisapproved\nComments:",

For the reasons set forth below, the Community Plan is \nAPPROVED by the Court with certain modifications and ORDERED as an enforceable Order of \nthis Court. \nI. \nBackground \nThe Community Plan arises out of a settlement between the parties of the United States' \nfourth motion for contempt regarding conditions at Arlington Developmental Center {\"ADC\"). \nIn its motion for contempt, the L'nited States, relying in part on the Monitor's Second and Third \nSemi-Annual Compliance Reports, argued that the defendants had failed to comply with the \n;r \n7,  \nThis document ens>ed  doc~t sheet in compliance with Rule. 5_8 anO[ot \n79 (o) FRCP on  - /-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062.-.B..B D-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 2 of 17 \nRemedial Order and other Court orders. \nIn lieu of sanctions, defendants acknowledged that they were in contempt as to the areas \nof non-compliance identified in the Second Semi-Annual Compliance Report, with the exception \nof Section XIV (Admissions and Placement), and agreed to the entry of a Stipulation and Order, \ndated June 24, 1996.  As part of the Stipulation and Order, defendants agreed, inter alia, to \ndevelop three plans, including a plan for community placement and development of community \nservices.  In general, the Stipulation and Order requires that each of the three plans address the \nrequirements of the Remedial Order and the other Orders of the Court.  In particular, the \nStipulation and Order specifically requires that the Community Plan contain, at a minimum, \nseveral ''essential elements,\" including: \n[Alli citizens shall be evaluated by competent professionals who are members of the IDT \nfor the appropriateness of community placement, and evaluations by consultants \nindependent of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation shall be \nconducted for those individuals for whom the IDT docs not recommend community \nplacement, and collectively these evaluations will form the basis of each citizen's \nindividualized plans which will be implemented by defendants in a manner consistent \nwith applicable federal law and federal funding requirements; citizens who arc kno\\VIl or \nsuspected of having been abused or repeatedly injured shall receive consideration for \ncommunity placement on a priority basis; at least one additional employee shall be hired \nimmediately to work full-time coordinating community placement and development; \nDefendants will retain and utilize additional qualified consultants in the area of \ncommunity placement; Defendants will implement a well-defined, effective quality \nassurance and monitoring system to monitor the placements after they have been made to \nensure that the placements are meeting the needs of the individuals placed; and address \nthose clements identified in the Monitor's April 1, 1996 Response. \nUnited States v. State of Tennessee, Civ. ~o. 92-2062, slip op at 2-3 (W.D. Tenn. June 24, 1996) \n(McCalla, J.).  With respect to these essential clements, the Stipulation and Order unequivocally \nstates: \nThese essential elements of each plan and other significant portions of the plans shall be \n\n-\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 3 of 17 \n._. \naccomplished by dates certain established in the plans and shall be enforceable by the \nCourt. \n1996 Stipulation at~ II.B.2 (emphasis added). \nOn March 20, 1997, defendants filed the Community Plan for West Tennessee with the \nCourt.  A hearing on the Plan was held on May 9, 1997, and May 13, 1997, at which the Court \nheard extensive testimony regarding the development of and various aspects of the Community \nPlan.  At the close of the hearing, the Court invited the parties to submit written arguments in \nlieu of closing arguments.  Although the parties have raised a number of issues in their \nsubmittals, the two main issues before the Court are whether the Court should approve the \nCommunity Plan, and, if so, whether the Court should make the Community Plan an enforceable \nOrder of this Court. \nII. \nShould the Court Approve the Community Plan? \nThere is little doubt that the Community Plan is an extensive and detailed document.  In \ntotal, the Community Plan contains eight chapters and approximately 549 specific provisions of \nservices and support to current and former ADC residents.  At the hearing on this matter, the \nCourt heard extensive testimony regarding the extensiveness and quality of the Community Plan. \nNot surprisingly, however, given the broad sweep of the Community Plan and the fact that this \nrepresents a paradigm shift by the State of Tennessee in the provision of services to the \ndevelopmentally disabled, there were a number of problems and deficiencies identified by the \nparties and their witnesses at the hearing. \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 4 of 17 \n..; \n'-\nA. \nOf particular concern to both the United States and People First is the relative scope of \nthe class of former and current ADC residents covered by the Plan.  As submitted, the benefits \nof the Community Plan arc limited to those class members still residing at ADC.  In its closing \nargument and proposed order, the United States seeks to extend the benefits and protection of the \nCommunity Plan back to March 12, 1991, the date on which it sent the noncompliance letter to \nthe State of Tennessee.  In its closing argument, People First seeks to extend the benefits and \nprotections of the Community Plan to the entire class certified in People First v. Arlington \nDevelopmental Center, Civ. No. 92-2213, slip op. (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 26, 1995) (McCalla, J.). \nOn June 24, 1997, defendants filed a rebuttal to the United States' and People First's closing \narguments and a motion to strike People First's Second Community Review, which was filed in \nopen court at the hearing held on May 13, 1997.  In short, the basis of defendants' motion is that \nPeople First has applied an analysis of compliance with the Remedial Order to a portion of the \nclass not covered by the Remedial Order.  According to defendants, the protections of the \nRemedial Order extend only to those who were still residents at ADC on the date the Remedial \nOrder was entered -- i.e., September 2, 1994.  In particular, defendants assert that no class has \nbeen certified in this case, that the remedy of the Remedial Order does not extend to all class \nmembers, including those subject to the review, that applying the Community Plan to all class \nmembers would extend the Remedial Order beyond the agreement of the parties, and that there \nhas been no adjudication of the constitutional violations of class members not covered by the \nRemedial Order. \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 5 of 17 \n..... \n..,; \nDefendants' argument that the Remedial Order does not apply to the class is entirely \nunpersuasive.  As all of the parties in this case well know, the litigation over the conditions at \nADC have involved two parallel and interrelated cases:  United States v. State of Tennessee, Civ. \nNo. 92-2062 (W.D. Tenn.) (McCalla, J.) lhercinafter \"DOJ case\"], and People First v, Arlington \nDevelopmental Center, Civ. No. 92-2213 (W.D. Tenn.) (McCalla, J.) [\"People First case\"].  On \nSeptember 26, 1995, this Court certified a class in the People First case consisting of \"all persons \nwho after December 12, 1989, have resided or arc residing at the Arlington Developmental \nCenter, all persons who have been transferred to other facilities but who remain the defendants' \nresponsibility, and all persons at risk of being placed in the Center.\"  By Order dated September \n27, 1995, the Court granted People First's Motion to Enter Findings from the DOJ case in the \nPeople First case and entered the Remedial Order as a final order in the People First case.  Thus, \nit is beyond dispute that the protections of the Remedial Order extend to all members of the class. \nMoreover, in that same Order, the Court granted People First and the Parent-Guardian \nAssociation of Arlington Developmental Center (\"PGA\") intervenor status in the DOJ case, \nfinding that the interests of the class were not adequately represented in the DOJ case and would \nbe adversely affected if they were not accorded intervenor status.  Hy Order dated March 21, \n1996, the Court then found that the DOJ case was the proper forum for both People First and the \nPGA to pursue any further relief such as motions for contempt or motions for further relief.  The \npractical effect of these Orders is that the class, as defined in the People First case, is a viable \nclass in the DOJ case and is entitled to the full protections of the Remedial Order. \n\n..., \nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 6 of 17 \n1w \nFurthermore, as noted above, the Community Plan arises out of a settlement between the \nUnited States, People First, and the defendants regarding the United States' fourth motion for \ncontempt regarding conditions at ADC.  In its motion for contempt, the United States, relying in \npart on the Monitor's Second and Third Semi-Annual Compliance Reports, argued that the \ndefendants had failed to comply with the Remedial Order and other Court Orders.  In lieu of \nsanctions, defendants acknowledged that they were in contempt and agreed to the entry of a \nStipulation and Order, dated June 24, 1996.  As part of the Stipulation and Order, defendants \nagreed, inter alia, to develop three plans, including a plan for community placement and \ndevelopment of community services.  Thus, the Community Plan, as developed and agreed to by \nthe defendants, is designed to bring defendants into compliance with the Remedial Order, which, \nas noted above, applies to all class members. \nIn sum, it is far too late in the day for defendants to make this argument. 1  Accordingly, \nthe Court adopts the position of People First and MODIFIES the Community Plan so that its \nbenefits and protections extend to all members of the class in People First v. Arlington \nDevelopmental Center.2  Accordingly, defendants must extend the services, benefits, and \n1  This conclusion should come as no surprise to the defendants.  On the contrary, as late as May 13, 1997, \nthe defendants themselves were acknowledging that the benefits of the Remedial Order and the Community Plan \nextended to all members ofthe class.  For example, Lynn Rucker, the primary author of the Community Plan, \ntestified that the Community Plan appl!ed to all class members.  Likewise, Rick Campbell, the director of the \nCommission on Compliance, testified that the benefits of the Remedial Order and Community Plan extended to \nthose class members discharged before the entry ofthe Remedial Order. \n2 Even assuming that the Remedial Order did not extend to the entire class, the Court, consistent with the \nposition of the United States, finds that the benefits of the Remedial Order and, consequently, the Community Plan \nextend to those individuals who were residing or have resided at the Arlington Developmental Center since March \n12, 1991, the date on which the United States sent the noncompliance letter to the State of Tennessee.  This \nconclusion rests not only on the evidence before the Court hut on this Court's previous findings of unconstitutional \nconditions at ADC.  In its Findings of Fact, dated February 17, 1994, the Court found that \"the evidence shows that \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 7 of 17 \n,.,./ \nprotections of the Plan to all former residents of ADC who are also members of the class \ncertified in People First v. Arlington Developmental Ccntcr.3 \nconditions at Arlington Developmental Center in 1990, 1991, and 1992 ... and continuing through the present, do \nnot comply with minimal requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  A number of residents who were \nsubjected to these unconstitutional conditions at ADC, however, were discharged from ADC just prior to the trial in \nthis case.  Indeed, the trial testimony of the former Supcrintendant of ADC and accompanying exhibits made clear \nthat the placement of those individuals occurred as a result of the United States' investigation and lawsuit.  Tr. at \n206-214 (testimony of Mona Winfrey, Sept. 13, 1993); Tr Exh. 271 & 272. \nIn reviewing these placements, the Court found that defendants had not exercised professional judgment in \ndischarging these individuals:  \"None of the medical staff at ADC are charged with or are taking the responsibility \nto evaluate or coordinate resident discharges into the community in light of their potential medical needs.  Although \ncommunity placement may be appropriate for residents of ADC and may serve to foster the resident's growth and \ndevelopment, Defendants' placement process or 'dumping' does not reflect the exercise of professional judgment.\" \nFindings at 29-30 (emphasis added).  In essence, defendants haphazardly discharged residents of ADC in an attempt \nto thwart the United States' investigation. \nNot surprisingly, the parties are now reporting that this \"dumping\" has led to inadequate conditions in the \ncommunity settings.  At the hearing held on May 13, 1997, People First's expert, Ruby Moore, directly related this \n\"dumping\" to the inadequate conditions existing where several children now reside: \nSome people were moved in the middle of the night hurriedly ... in their haste some things happened that \nmade placements even less adequate and appropriate, such as people coming out and having someone else's \nwheelchair or people  didn't have their adaptive equipment. \nTr. at 306 (Testimony of Ruby Moore. May !3, 1997).  People First's recent review of its class members' \ncommunity placements identified several additional deficiencies.  For example, People First found the following \ndeficiencies for children placed before the entry of the Remedial Order:  unsafe feeding practices; inadequate \nseizure management; inadequate medication follow-up; use of inappropriate medications or medications \ncontraindicated; inadequate medical follow-up; scoliosis not addressed even though the record indicated that it was \nworsening; recommended treatment withheld because there was no insurance coverage; TennCare refused to pay for \nneeded leg braces for one individual; skin breakdown not being prevented or properly cared for; staff not keeping \nadequate data to provide appropriate care; functional assessments not being completed by any staff who are \nmembers of the IDT, and consequently appropriate services and programming arc not being identified.  In short, the \nparties are reporting that many of the same conditions now exist in the community that gave rise to this lawsuit m \nthe first place. \nContrary to defendants' assertions, this Court did not lose its authority to remedy the effects of the \nconstitutional harms suffered by the residents of ADC merely because the State discharged those residents from \nADC prior to the entry of the Remedial Order.  See Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1990); Armstead \nv. Coler, 914 F.2d 1464 (I Ith Cir. 1990); Williams v. Wasserman, 937 F. Supp. 524,526 (D. Md. 1996) (holding \nthat \"this court's jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims cannot be tenninated simply by operation of their relea-'>e \nform various institutions in which they are or have been housed during the pendency of this lawsuit\").  Indeed, \ndefendants cannot avoid the jurisdiction of this Court merely by moving individuals from one unconstitutional \nenvironment to another prior to the entry of judgment in the case.  Accordingly,  the Court finds, alternatively, that \nthe Community Plan covers those who have resided at ADC since March 12, 1991. \n3  In addition, both the United States and People First have requested that the State be found in contempt \non the basis of the Monitor's recent review and People First's review, as well as some testimony at the hearing. \nAlthough, as noted above, see supra note 2, the Court is troubled by the testimony given at the hearing with respect \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 8 of 17 \n'  W'  ,.-i \nB. \nAn additional concern raised by both the United States and People First was the lack of \nan independent monitoring system in the Community Plan.  In a related matter, the Parent \nGuardian Association questions those \"provisions of Chapter VII concerning movement of ADC \nresidents into community placement on average of eight (8) people each month.\"  PGA Closing \nat 1.  According to the Parent Guardian Association, the movement of eight ADC residents to the \ncommunity per month is arbitrary and will result in the deterioration of services at ADC itself. \nOnce again, given the history of this case and the particular circumstances from which this \nCommunity Plan arose, the Court has similar concerns.  Accordingly, in order to assure that the \nprovisions of the Community Plan arc being implemented and in order to assure that each \nmember of the class will receive adequate care and support, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n1.  The Monitor must approve the transition plan for each ADC resident prior to the \nresident's placement. \n2.  The Monitor, or her dcsigncc, must visit every residential site before placement \nunless the Monitor is already familiar with the home and its current residents and \nhas no reason to believe the new person could not be adequately and appropriately \nserved in this residential situation.  When deemed necessary by the Monitor in her \ndiscretion, she or her dcsigncc may visit the sites of nonresidential service \nproviders. \n3.  The Monitor, or her designee, must visit every person's placement within six \nweeks of the placement in order to review the first Independent Support Plan \ndeveloped by the new provider and to ensure that any conditions stated in the \nMonitor's approval of the person's transition plan have been met. \n4.  The Monitor and her staff must review every placement quarterly thereafter, and \nalso upon receipt of complaints or inquiries about the suitability of any placement \nto the conditions in the Community, the Court declines to accept the invitation of the United States and People First. \nIn particular, the Court notes that the hearing in this matter was not intended to find the defendants in contempt and, \ntherefore, defendants were not given an opportunity to respond to these assertions.  Moreover, by extending the \nprotections of the Community Plan to all class members, the Court notes that the Community Plan is designed to \nremedy these shortcomings.  See infra part 3.C. \n\n-\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 9 of 17 \n,_/ \nor related program.  At least one of these reviews must be conducted by the \nMonitor and her team of expert consultants.  If, upon review by the Monitor or her \nstaff, the Monitor has reason to be concerned about any individual, the Monitor \nmay conduct an additional review with her expert consultants. \n5.  The Monitor, or her designee, shall conduct an expedited review of all current \nplacements for former ADC residents who are also members of the class as \ndefined in  People First v. Arlington Developmental Center, Civ. No. 92-2213, \nslip op. (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 26, 1995) (McCalla, J.). \n6.  During reviews of compliance with the Remedial Order, the Monitor shall include \nboth the Strategy elements of the Community Plan and the \"Implementation \nIndicators\" as possible criteria for compliance, which is illustrated in Appendix B \nof defendants' Plan. \nC. \nIn addition to an independent monitoring system, the United States and People First also \nseek unlimited access to all community facilities in order to monitor the defendants' compliance \nwith the Community Plan.  Although the Court agrees that both the United States and People \nFirst are entitled to have access to community facilities under the Remedial Order, the Court is \nconcerned that unrestricted access will interfere with both the ability of the State of Tennessee to \nprovide adequate services to the members of the class and the ability of the Court Monitor to \nadequately and effectively conduct the reviews that she is required to undertake.  Accordingly, in \norder to avoid these potential problems, the Court hereby requires that both People First and the \nUnited States seek and obtain the approval of the Court Monitor prior to conducting any on-site \nreview of any community facility. \nD. \nIn its closing argument, People First requests that certain specific parts of the Community \nPlan be extended to cover members of the entire class.  In particular, People First requests that \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-.B...B. D-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/.2.1-/97  Page 10 of 17 \nthe Plan be modified to include all members of the class within the Individual Needs Analysis \nsection of the Plan, rather than just those class members still at ADC.  Moreover, People First \nseeks to have the Plan modified to include the provision of independent support coordination for \nall class members.  Finally, similar to the United States, People First argues that the Plan should \nbe modified to include a Plan of Correction to describe how non-compliance with the Remedial \nOrder as identified by the Monitor and People First in their respective reviews will be modified. \nAfter reviewing these requests, the Court notes that, in reality, People First is merely \nrequesting that certain provisions of the Plan be extended to all members of the class.  Because \nthe Court has already ordered that all of the protections and benefits of the entire Plan, including \nthe specific provisions identified by People First, be extended to the entire class, the Court \ndeclines People First's invitation to highlight specific parts of the Plan at the exclusion of others. \nE. \nIn sum, after reviewing all of the testimony and other submittals in this matter, the Court \nhereby ADOPTS the Community Plan with the modifications set forth above. \n\n.,,, \nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 11  of 17 \n' \nIll. \nShould the Court Order the Community Plan? \nHaving determined that the Community Plan should be approved, with the modifications \nset forth above, the Court must next decide whether to make the Community Plan an enforceable \norder of the Court.  Both the United States and People First unequivocally request that the Plan \nbe ordered by the Court.  According to the United States, the \"language of the Stipulation [and \nOrder] more than adequately conveys the position of the United States that 'significant \nprovisions' of the Plan would be ordered.  In fact, the Stipulation's essential quid pro quo is just \nthis:  the United States and People First agreed to extend the deadlines that defendants had not \nmet in exchange for a plan that would contain more specific, enforceable provisions for \ncommunity placement and development than those contained in prior Court Orders.\"  USA \nClosing Argument at 3.  Likewise, People First argues that \"the Defendants have agreed to the \nStipulation in lieu of contempt sanctions, have agreed that parts of the plan will be enforceable, \nhave identified in the plan itself those elements of the plan which, at a minimum, would be \nenforceable, and now seeks to have the Court not only not order any of the plan to be \nenforceable, but to have the Court also modify the Remedial Order and Stipulation.\"  People First \nClosing at 5.  Similarly, the Parent Guardian Association, although maintaining its continued \nopposition to many of the steps taken by the Court and the parties, requests that the Plan be \nenforceable as  an order of this Court. \nAlthough defendants have not responded directly to the parties' arguments, defendants \nnonetheless argue that the Court should not adopt this Plan as an enforceable order of this Court. \nInstead, defendants argue that the Court should merely \"approve the Plan as a working document \n\n.., \n..., \nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 12 of 17 \n. \nand allow the State of Tennessee to make appropriate changes in the specific aspects of the Plan \n(including strategy implementation indicators, persons responsible, and target dates) upon \nconsultation with and approval by the Monitor.\"  Def. 's Closing Argument at 4. \nA \nDefendants first argue that, because the Plan represents a \"paradigm shift\" in policy and \naction by the State of Tennessee, flexibility is crucial to the success of the Plan.  According to the \nState, if the Court chooses to order the Plan, \"then modifications can only be made through the \nprocess of Court hearings, a process which involves considerable time and significant \nexpenditures of money in costs and legals fees which could better be served by use in the \nimplementation of the Plan itself.\"  Id. at 6. \nThe Court recognizes that, despite the extensiveness of the Plan as submitted, it is not a \nperfect plan.  A number of changes will have to be made in order to improve the quality of \nservices and support provided to the members of the class either in or soon to be transitioned to \nthe community.  In this respect, the Court acknowledges the defendants' concerns about the \nflexibility needed to successfully implement this Plan and successfully transition the State of \nTennessee from an institution orientated provider to a community provider.  The Court, however, \ndisagrees with the defendants' contentions that if this plan is ordered by the Court, then this \nflexibility will be lost.  Contrary to defendants' assertions, each and every change in the plan will \nnot require an in-court hearing on the proposed changes.  Instead, as the parties' experience with \nchanges to the remedial order have shown, such changes must be made through negotiations \namong the parties and Monitor, must ultimately be approved by the Monitor, and then submitted \n\n-\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 13 of 17 \nto the Court for final approval.  Such changes to the remedial order have occurred on at least \nthree occasions, each time without holding an in-court hearing. \nMoreover, the Court notes that defendants themselves request that the any and all changes \nbe approved by the Monitor.  At that point, the vast majority of the work required to change the \nPlan will have been completed, and all that is left is for the parties to submit the change(s) to the \nCourt for ultimate approval.  Of course, the Court has ultimate approval over any proposed \nchange and retains the right to hold a hearing on any such proposed change at its discretion. \nB. \nDefendants next argue that this Court should follow the procedure utilized by the Court \nand the parties with regard to the Institutional Plan, another plan required by the Stipulation and \nOrder of 1996.  According to defendants, \"[b]y Agreed Order of the Parties, the Court ordered \nthe Institutional Plan as a working document, changed by approval of the monitor, and further, \nsubmitted deadlines for implementation to be adopted and enforced in lieu of the original \ndeadlines in the Remedial Order (Stipulation and Order Regarding the Compliance Plan, \nFebruary 3, 1997).  This same proposal is here being submitted by Defendants regarding the \nCommunity Plan.\"  Id. at 7. \nThe problem with this argument is that the defendants are not seeking the same result as \nin the Institutional Compliance Plan.  In that case, by defendants' own admission, \"the Court \nordered the Institutional Plan as a working document ... \"  Id. at 7.  In this case, defendants are \nasking the Court not to order the Community Plan, but rather, to merely approve it. \n\n-\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 14 of 17 \n,,J \nC \nDefendants also argue that if this Court chooses to \"order the plan\" then the State of \nTennessee will face an exponential increase in the susceptibility of sanctions for any perceived \n\"violation\" of the Plan which would in tum constitute a violation of this Court's order. \nAccording to the State, \nWith so many implementation factors in the Plan and such a significant amount of time \nand effort involved in the Plan's implementation, and since the proof from all parties \nindicates that the Plan is a paradigm shift in State policy of a very ambitious and \nsignificant nature, it is ... unfair immediately to subject the State of Tennessee to a \nmultiplied risk of exposure over and above that which it already has and for which it is \npresently being punished with fines. \nContrary to defendants' assertions, however, defendants will not automatically be held in \ncontempt and sanctioned for any perceived \"violation\" of the Plan which would in tum constitute \na violation of this Court's Order.  The Sixth Circuit test for judging compliance with a court order \nis whether the contemnor \"took all reasonable steps within their power to comply with the court's \norder.\"  Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703,708 (6th Cir. 1991).4  Precisely what \"all reasonable \nsteps within [the contemnor's] power\" are varies from case to case according to the requirements \nof the order and the particular circumstances of the case.  In every case, however, a contemnor \nmust have the ability to comply with the order before failure to comply can form the basis of \ncontempt.  McNeil v. Director, Patuxent Institution, 407 U.S. 245, 251 ( 1972); Maggio v. Zeitz, \n33 U.S. 56, 72 (1948).  Other than a showing of the impossibility of compliance, however, \nnothing short of substantial compliance, as measured by the test set forth in Peppers v. Barry. 873 \n4  For a more thorough discussion ofa court's inherent power to hold parties in contempt and of the \nappropriateness of contempt sanctions, see United States v. State of Tennessee, 925 F. Supp. 1292, 1300-04 (W D. \nTenn. 1995). \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 15 of 17 \n- .-,i \nF .2d 967 (6th Cir. 1989), will suffice to purge contempt for noncompliance with a court order. \nThe Sixth Circuit has explicitly rejected the contention that a good faith effort is sufficient, id. at \n968: TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 722 F.2d 1261, 1273 (6th Cir. 1983), and has not adopted \nthe less demanding diligent efforts test favored in other circuits, !Uk, Newman v. Graddick, 740 \nF.2d 1513, 1525 (11th Cir. 1984) (holding that \"a person who attempts with reasonable diligence \nto comply with a court order should not be held in contempt\"). \nAt the same time, the Court recognizes that courts have been particularly unsympathetic \nto purported excuses for less-than-substantial compliance where the contcmnor has participated \nin drafting the order against which compliance is measured.  E.g., Glover, 934 F.2d at 708-09 \n(finding state prison officials in contempt for failing to abide by order consisting of negotiated \nsettlement between the parties); see also Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265,276 (1990) \n(upholding a finding of contempt against city that had failed to take action required by the \nconsent decree).  In such cases, a party participating in the drafting of an order docs so with an \nunderstanding of what it reasonably can accomplish.  Accordingly, when the party subsequently \nfails to live up to the particulars of the order, it is more difficult for a court to excuse that failure \nthan if the order had been imposed by the court in its entirety. \nD. \nFinally, the State argues that, in the event that compliance becomes a problem, the Court \ncan always order the Plan in the future upon motion of any of the parties.  In response to this \nargument, the United States argues that in light of the Stipulation and Order, in which the \ndefendants agreed to the ordering of the Community Plan, the defendants past record of non-\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-.B..B, D-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/21/97  Page 16 of 17 \n,.J \ncompliance substantiates the need for making the plan enforceable by the Court.  The Court \nagrees. \nE. \nIn sum, the Court has before it an unequivocal Stipulation, entered in response to a \nmotion for contempt, signed by mutual agreement of the parties, including the defendants, in \nwhich the defendants admitted they were in contempt of previous orders regarding conditions at \nADC.  In light of the specific genesis of this proceeding and the overall history of this case, the \nCourt finds that the Community Plan should be enforceable as an Order of this Court. \nAccordingly, the Community Plan for West Tennessee is hereby ORDERED as an enforceable \norder of this Court. \nIV. \nORDER \nFor the reasons set forth above, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n1.  The Community Plan is hereby adopted by the Court; \n2.  The entire Community Plan is enforceable as a Court Order; \n3.  The Community Plan shall apply to all members of the class certified in People \nFirst v. Arlington Developmental Center, Civ. No. 92-2213, slip op. (W.D. Tenn. \nSept. 26, 1995) (McCalla, J.); and \n4.  The Community Plan, as adopted and ordered by this Court, supplements, but \ndoes not rescind, the Remedial Order and other orders in this case, except with \nregard to the timeframes for compliance.  In this respect, the defendants must \nremedy identified deficiencies in a timely manner. \nIn order to assure that the provisions of the Community Plan arc being implemented in a \nmanner to achieve compliance with the Remedial Order and in order to assure that each member \nof the class will receive adequate care and support, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n\n-\nCa~e 2:92-cv-02062-BBD-tmp  Document 753  Filed 08/2..1.,/,9 7  Page 17 of 17 \n1.  The Monitor must approve the transition plan for each ADC resident prior to the \nresident's placement. \n2.  The Monitor, or her designee, must visit every residential site before placement \nunless the Monitor is already familiar with the home and its current residents and \nhas no reason to believe the new person could not be adequately and appropriately \nserved in this residential situation.  When deemed necessary by the Monitor in her \ndiscretion, she or her designee may visit the sites of nonresidential service \nproviders. \n3.  The Monitor, or her designee, must visit every person's placement within six \nweeks of the placement in order to review the first Independent Support Plan \ndeveloped by the new provider and to ensure that any conditions stated in the \nMonitor's approval of the person's transition plan have been met. \n4.  The Monitor and her staff must review every placement quarterly thereafter, and \nalso upon receipt of complaints or inquiries about the suitability of any placement \nor related program.  At least one of these reviews must be conducted by the \nMonitor and her team of expert consultants.  If, upon review by the Monitor or her \nstaff, the Monitor has reason to be concerned about any individual, the Monitor \nmay conduct an additional review with her expert consultants. \n5.  The Monitor, or her designee, shall conduct an expedited review of all current \nplacements for former ADC residents who arc also members of the class as \ndefined in  People First v. Arlington Developmental Center, Civ. No. 92-2213, \nslip op. (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 26, 1995) (McCalla, J.). \n6.  During reviews of compliance with the Remedial Order, the Monitor shall include \nboth the Strategy clements of the Community Plan and the \"Implementation \nIndicators\" as possible criteria for compliance, which is illustrated in Appendix B \nof defendants' Plan. \n7.  The United States and People First arc also to be provided free access to \ncommunity facilities, as necessary, for monitoring the adequacy and \nappropriateness of placements.  All reviews of any community facilities by either \nthe United States or People First, however, must first be approved by the Monitor. \n.2.J \nIT IS SO ORDERED this  day of August 1997 \ns/Jon Phipps McCalla \n!TED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE ",

(\"People First\"), plaintiff \nthe United States (\"United States\"), and defendants the State of Tennessee, et al. (\"State\"), by \nand through undersigned counsel and respectfully move for an order:  (1) setting an informal \nstatus conference to establish the procedures for briefing, noticing, and hearing this motion;  \n(2) setting an evidentiary hearing on this motion; and (3) approving the Agreement attached \nhereto as Exhibit \"A.\"  In support of the motion, these parties state as follows: \n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2085   Filed 05/16/06   Page 2 of 6    PageID 10329\nDISCUSSION \n  The  parties  to  this  litigation,  including  intervenor  West  Tennessee  Parent  Guardian \nAssociation (“PGA”), have been engaged in extensive and protracted negotiations in an effort to \nreach an agreed resolution of a number of pending matters.  People First, the United States, and \nthe  State  have  reached  an  agreement  that  is  intended  to  resolve  these  pending  matters \n(“Agreement”).  The Agreement has been approved by the State, the United States, and People \nFirst, on behalf of the Class.   \nWhile the PGA actively participated in the negotiations leading up to the completion of \nthe Agreement and, indeed, helped shape the Agreement, it was unwilling to become a signatory \nto the Agreement.  People First, the United States, and the State believe that the Agreement is in \nthe best interests of their respective clients and the members of the Class and request the Court to \napprove the Agreement notwithstanding PGA's decision not to sign it.   \n  If approved, the Agreement would resolve the following: \n  1.  Stipulation  of  Settlement  and  Order  of  Provisional  Approval  of  Mediated \nSettlement Agreement, filed February 13, 2002 [Dkt. #1566]; \n  2.  Order  Denying  the  Approval  of  Mediation  Settlement  Agreement,  entered \nFebruary 21, 2003 [Dkt. #1698]; \n  3.  Motion by People First for an Order Requiring Defendants to Show Cause, filed \nSeptember 30, 2003 [Dkt. #1774]; \n  4.  Order Granting People First's Motion for Order Requiring Defendants to Show \nCause, entered April 5, 2004 [Dkt. #1871]; \n  5.  Motion to Set Aside/Suspend without Prejudice Order Requiring Defendant to \nAppear and Show Cause, filed December 15, 2004 [Dkt. #1942]; \n  2\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2085   Filed 05/16/06   Page 3 of 6    PageID 10330\n  6.  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order,  for  Order  Disapproving  Settlement \nAgreement and for Injunctive Relief by PGA, filed December 28, 2004 [Dkt. #1951]; \n  7.  Mandate of the United States Court of Appeals (to reconsider the Mediation \nSettlement Agreement), entered August 18, 2005 [Dkt. #2038]; and \n  8.  Order  Regarding  Scope  of  the  Class  Definition,  entered  July  17,  2000  [Dkt. \n#1302].1 \n  The  State  has  made  the  policy  decision  to  close  Arlington  Developmental  Center \n(“ADC”).  The parties to the Agreement support the State’s decision and agree that the State has \nthe authority to make this policy decision.  The Court's approval of the attached Agreement will \nensure an orderly and careful closure of the ADC, the safe transition of Class Members presently \nliving at ADC to community residences, and the accelerated development of a comprehensive \nnetwork of services and supports for Class Members as they enter and live in the community.  \nThe parties to the Agreement believe that the Agreement is historic in scope and heralds a new \nday for the delivery of an array of progressive services to each member of the Class in the least \nrestrictive environment appropriate to each Class Member's needs.  The Court's Monitor supports \nthe Agreement and will testify in favor of its approval. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n  People First, the United States, and the State request the following relief: \n  1.  Entry of an order setting an informal status conference to discuss a schedule for \nthe hearing and to set deadlines for briefing and other pre-hearing activities; \n  2.  Entry of an order setting an evidentiary hearing to approve the Agreement; \n                                                 \n1 The issues concerning the scope of the at-risk Class are presently on appeal.  United States v. \nState of Tennessee, et al., No. 00-6120, argued July 2005 (the “at-risk Appeal”).  If the \nAgreement is approved and a new interpretation of the at-risk class adopted as set forth therein, \nthe at-risk Appeal will be dismissed.  See Agreement Sec. X.

The United States' Motion was based, in part, on the Monitor's Second\nSemi-Annual Compliance Report.  The United States filed a supplemental\nmemorandum in support of its Motion on June 14, 1996, that referenced the Monitor's\nmost recent Third Semi-Annual Compliance Report.  The Court set a hearing on the\nUnited States' Motion for June 21, 1996.  In order to avoid the costs associated with\nentertd  on docket  sheet  in  compliance  with Hule  55 a*d  <*\nThis  document\n32  (t>)  FRCrP\n\nlitigation, the parties Iv.eby agree to the following Stipulate  . and Order, if approved\nand so ordered by this Court.\nI.  Defendants hereby acknowledge that they were in contempt as to the\nareas of non-compliance identified in the Second Compliance Report, except Section\nXIV (Admissions and Placement).\nII.  In lieu of sanctions for contempt, Defendants agree to the following:\nA.  Development of Three Plans\n1.  Defendants shall develop three comprehensive plans:\na plan for institutional compliance; a plan for institutional phase-down; and a\ncommunity placement and development plan.  The plans must be approved by the\nMonitor and the Court.  The parties will have the opportunity to comment on the draft\nplans and, if a party objects to a final plan submitted to the Court, the party may file\nobjections with the Court.  Defendants will retain consultants with expertise in drafting\ncompliance plans of this nature to assist Defendants in drafting these plans.  The\nparties may submit to Defendants recommendations of consultants to assist\nDefendants in developing these plans, and the Defendants shall select the consultants,\nsubject to the approval of the Monitor.  A completed draft of the institutional compliance\nplan shall be submitted to the Monitor and the parties by September 1. 1996: a\ncompleted draft of the institutional phase-down shall be submitted to the Monitor and\nthe parties by October 1. 1996: and a completed draft of the community placement and\ndevelopment plan shall be submitted to the Monitor and the parties by November 15.\n1996.  These dates may be changed if the parties and the Monitor agree.  The parties\nshall submit comments on the plans within 10 days of receiving them.  A final version of\neach plan shall be reviewed and approved or rejected by the Monitor within 10 days of\n\nthe Monitor receiving i, .<* parties' comments.  If approved, t..- plan will be sent to the\nCourt for final approval.  Any party objecting to the plan shall have 10 days after it is\nsent to the Court to file any objections.\n2.  The plans shall address, at a minimum, the\nrequirements of the Remedial Order and the other court orders.  In addition, the\ninstitutional compliance plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following essential\nelements:  special monitoring for citizens who are behaviorally and medically at risk;\nsurvey of citizen needs; necessary staff and staff training; provision of specialized\nservices; quality assurance; use of consultants; and address those elements identified\nby the Monitor in her April 1, 1996 Response to the Parties' Comments Regarding\nDefendants' Proposed Milestones (Monitor's April 1, 1996 Response).  The institutional\nphase-down plan shall contain, at a minimum, provisions sufficient to address the\nissues relevant to the downsizing identified in the Monitor's April 1, 1996 Response.\nThe community placement and development plan shall contain, at a minimum, the\nfollowing essential elements:  all citizens shall be evaluated by competent\nprofessionals who are members of the IDT for the appropriateness of community\nplacement, and evaluations by consultants independent of the Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation shall be conducted for those individuals for whom the\nIDT does not recommend community placement, and collectively these evaluations will\nform the basis for each citizen's individualized plans which will be implemented by\nDefendants in a manner consistent with applicable federal law and federal funding\nrequirements; citizens who are known or suspected of having been abused or\nrepeatedly injured shall receive consideration for community placement on a priority\nbasis; at least one additional employee shall be hired immediately to work full-time\n\ncoordinating communii placement and development; Defei.-ants will retain and utilize\nr\nadditional qualified consultants in the area of community placement; Defendants will\nimplement a well-defined, effective quality assurance and monitoring system to monitor\nthe placements after they have been made to ensure that the placements are meeting\nthe needs of the individuals placed; and address those elements identified in the\nMonitor's April 1, 1996 Response.  These essential elements of each plan and other\nsignificant provisions of the plans shall be accomplished by dates certain established in\nthe plans and shall be enforceable by the Court.  Upon the Court's approval of the\nplans, the time frames for implementation in the plans will supplant the deadlines in the\nprevious Court orders (except for the deadlines associated with the 25 critical\nprovisions of the Remedial Order referred to in Section B of this document and with the\nprovisions of the Emergency Order/Preliminary Injunction of July 21, 1995) and will be\nenforceable.  Detailed strategy components within the plans may be changed by\nDefendants as necessary and appropriate, after opportunity for comment by the parties,\nif approved by the Monitor.\nB.  Automatic Sanctions\n1.  The Monitor, after consultation with the parties, has\nidentified 30 critical areas of non-compliance (Attachment A) based upon the Third\nSemi-Annual Review as potential provisions for automatic sanctions. Within five days\nof the entry of this Stipulation and Order by the Court, Defendants may choose five of\nthese provisions to strike from the list.  If, at the time of the Monitor's Fourth Semi-\nAnnual Review, the Monitor finds that Defendants still are not in compliance with any\none of these 25 provisions, Defendants shall pay automatic sanctions of $1,000 a day\nfor each provision with which they are found not in compliance until the date upon\n\nwhich they come into compliance, as determined by the Cou...  Automatic sanction\nfines for these 25 provisions under this Stipulation and Order are limited to an annual\ntotal of two million dollars.  If this annual cap is reached for these provisions, the\nparties may seek the Court's approval to have the cap increased upon a showing that\nthe Defendants are in contempt with respect to any of these 25 provisions.\n2.  In order to ensure that Defendants have notice of\ncontinuing deficiencies, the Monitor will file with the parties and the Court her final\nconclusions with regard to these 25 provisions within 15 days of the last day of her\ntours.  The Monitor's findings regarding these provisions and the imposition of these\nautomatic fines are not contestable.  The automatic fines begin upon notification by the\nMonitor of Defendants' non-compliance with any of these 25 provisions for which they\nare being fined and continue until Defendants come into compliance with the provisions\nfor which they are being fined.  Defendants will have an opportunity to demonstrate\ncompliance with those provisions for which the Monitor found them not in compliance.\nIII.  The parties agree that no motion for contempt shall be filed based upon\nthe Monitor's recent Third Semi-Annual Compliance Report.\nIV.  Defendants agree to immediately withdraw all current appeals.\nDONE and ORDERED this _ Kj  day of  V r *^  • 1996 at Memphis,\nTennessee.\nrable Jon P. McCalla\nf.

As part of Settlement Negotiations and Mediation discussions, the parties have \nagreed on a list of 182 persons who will be reconsidered for membership in the at risk portion of \nthe Arlington Class (the “List”).  The individuals on the List are set forth in the attached Exhibit \nB. The persons on the List shall hereinafter be referred to as “Potential Class Members.”  The \nprocess by which the Potential Class Members will be considered for Class Membership is set \nforth in the provisions of the Intake Process for the At-Risk Arlington Class (the “Process”).  \n  2.  As part of the Process, and in order to be eligible for Class Membership, each of \nthe Potential Class Members will be reviewed by the State to determine whether all of the \nfollowing are true for that individual: \n    a.  Does not have a denied PAE for Intermediate Care Facilities for \nIndividuals with Intellectual Disabilities (“ICF/IID”) (i.e., ICF/MR) level of care on or after \nSeptember 11, 2007, with the sole exception that PAE denials prior to January 1, 2013, will not \ncause the exclusion of the following three individuals for reconsideration under the Process:  \nVirginia C.; Dorothy R.; and, Mary S.;  \n    b.  Is not enrolled, and/or does not become enrolled during the Process, in a \nSection 1915(c) waiver for persons with Intellectual Disabilities;   \n    c.

Meets Medicaid medical (i.e., level of care) and financial eligibility \ncriteria for ICF/IID services. \n  3.  If at any time in the Process, the State determines that a Potential Class Member \ndoes not satisfy the requirements set forth in the preceding subparagraph (Section II.A.2.), the \nState will provide to the Parties via email transmission the name of the Potential Class  \nMember(s), along with the Section II.A.2 criteria the Potential Class Member(s) fails to meet \npursuant to the provisions set forth below (see Section II.A.4.a through II.A.4.g).  \n  4.  At the outset of and/or throughout the Process, the following steps shall be taken \nby the State relative to Sections II.A.2 and II.A.3: \n    a.  The TennCare PreAdmission Evaluation System (“TPAES”) and the paper \nworkcard history which pre-dates the implementation of the electronic workflow system are the \nsystem of record regarding PreAdmission Evaluation (“PAE”) (i.e., level of care or medical) \neligibility determinations.  TennCare has reviewed some of and will continue to review these \nrecords for each Potential Class Member to determine whether a PAE has been previously denied \nfor ICF/IID level of care.  If it is determined that any Potential Class Member(s) has a previously \ndenied ICF/IID PAE, the State will provide to the Parties via e-mail transmission the name of the \nPotential Class Member, or list of Potential Class  Members, for whom there is a previous denial, \nincluding the date of such denial. The first business day following the transmission date of the \nnotification e-mail shall be referred to as the “Prior Denied PAE Notice Date.”  The Parties will \nhave 30 calendar days from the Prior Denied PAE Notice Date to submit to the State proof that \nthe Potential Class Member did not have a prior denied ICF/IID PAE.  If, within 30 calendar \ndays from the Prior Denied PAE Notice Date, the Parties fail to provide the State with proof that \nthe Potential Class Member did not have a prior denied ICF/IID PAE, the Potential Class \n- 5 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 6 of 37    PageID 21728 \n     \nMember(s) shall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class \nand no further efforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process.  If the Parties provide \nproof within the 30 day period, the State shall consider it in good faith and issue a determination \nrelative to the same within fourteen (14) days.  If the State’s determination continues to be that \nthe Potential Class Member has a prior denied ICF/IID PAE, it will notify the Parties via e-mail \ntransmission of such determination, and the Parties shall have seven (7) days to contest that \ndetermination pursuant to Section II.A.4.i below.  If the Parties do not contest the determination \nwithin seven (7) days, the Potential Class Member(s) shall be finally and forever ineligible for \nmembership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further efforts shall be undertaken by the State \nunder this Process. \n    b.  The State and the Parties have already removed for consideration \nindividuals who were determined to be in a Section 1915(c) waiver for persons with Intellectual \nDisabilities and those persons were purposely excluded from the List.  If the State determines \nthat any other Potential Class Members are enrolled, or become enrolled during the Process, in a \nSection 1915(c) waiver for persons with Intellectual Disabilities, the State will provide to the \nParties via e-mail transmission the name(s) of the Potential Class Member(s), including the \nspecific waiver in which the person is enrolled and the services currently authorized as shown \nwithin the Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disability (“DIDD”) Community \nServices Tracking system.  The first business day following the transmission date of the \nnotification e-mail shall be referred to as the “Enrolled In Services Notice Date.”  The Parties \nwill have 30 calendar days from the Enrolled In Services Notice Date to submit to the State proof  \nthat the Potential Class Member is not enrolled in waiver services.  If, within 30 calendar days \nfrom the Enrolled In Services Notice Date, the Parties fail to provide the State with proof that the \n- 6 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 7 of 37    PageID 21729 \n     \nPotential Class Member is not enrolled in services, the Potential Class Member(s) shall be finally \nand forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further efforts shall be \nundertaken by the State under this Process.  If the Parties provide proof within the 30 day period, \nthe State shall consider it in good faith and issue a determination relative to the same within \nfourteen (14) days. If the State’s determination continues to be that the Potential Class Member \nis enrolled in waiver services, it will notify the Parties via e-mail transmission of such  \ndetermination, and the Parties shall have seven (7) days to contest that determination pursuant to \nSection II.A.4.i below. If the Parties do not contest the determination within seven (7) days, the \nPotential Class Member(s) shall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk \nArlington class and no further efforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process. \n    c.  DIDD will review all documentation obtained by the at-risk team prior to  \nclosure of the Arlington Developmental Center, or compiled and added during the Process, (the \n“At-risk Records”) in order to confirm that each Potential Class Member had a qualifying \ninstitutional stay, as described in the 2006 Settlement Agreement.  The State will provide to the \nParties via email transmission a list of all Potential Class Members for whom there is no  \nconfirmation of a qualifying institutional stay. The first business day following the transmission \ndate of the notification email shall be referred to as the “No Qualifying Institutional Stay Notice \nDate.” The Parties will have 30 calendar days from the No Qualifying Institutional Stay Notice \nDate to submit to the State proof of a qualifying institutional stay for any Potential Class \nMember.  If, within 30 calendar days from the No Qualifying Institutional Stay Notice Date, the \nParties fail to provide the State with proof of a qualifying institutional stay, such Potential Class \nMembers shall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and \nno further efforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process.  If the Parties provide proof \n- 7 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 8 of 37    PageID 21730 \n     \nwithin the 30 day period, the State shall consider it in good faith and issue a determination \nrelative to the same within fourteen (14) days.  If the State’s determination continues to be that \nthe Potential Class Member does not have a qualifying institutional stay, it will notify the Parties \nvia e-mail transmission of such determination, and the Parties shall have seven (7) days to \ncontest that determination pursuant to Section II.A.4.i below.  If the Parties do not contest the \ndetermination within seven (7) days, the Potential Class Member(s) shall be finally and forever \nineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further efforts shall be undertaken \nby the State under this Process. \n    d.  DIDD will review the At-risk Records in order to confirm that each \nPotential Class Member resided in West Tennessee on October 27, 2010.  The State will provide \nto the Parties via email transmission a list of all Potential Class Members who did not reside in \nWest Tennessee on October 27, 2010. The first business day following the transmission date of \nthe notification email shall be referred to as the “Non-Resident of West Tennessee Notice Date.”  \nThe Parties will have 30 calendar days from the Non-Resident of West Tennessee Notice Date to \nsubmit to the State proof of residency in West Tennessee on October 27, 2010 for any Potential \nClass Member on the list.  If, within 30 calendar days from the Non-Resident of West Tennessee \nNotice Date, the Parties fail to provide the State with proof of residency in West Tennessee on \nOctober 27, 2010, such Potential Class Member(s) will be removed from the Potential List and \nshall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class. If the Parties \nprovide proof within the 30 day period, the State shall consider it in good faith and issue a \ndetermination relative to the same within fourteen (14) days.  If the State’s determination \ncontinues to be that the Potential Class Member was not a resident of West Tennessee on \nOctober 27, 2010, it will notify the Parties via e-mail transmission of such determination, and the \n- 8 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 9 of 37    PageID 21731 \n     \nParties shall have seven (7) days to contest that determination pursuant to Section II.A.4.i below.  \nIf the Parties do not contest the determination within seven (7) days, the Potential Class \nMember(s) shall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class \nand no further efforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process. \n    e.  Potential Class Members currently enrolled in TennCare or receiving Food \nStamps or Families First assistance will be presumed to be current Tennessee residents.  \nTennCare will review the MMIS and DHS Accent System to confirm enrollment in these \nprograms.  Potential Class Members not enrolled in these programs will be asked, pursuant to \nSection II.F.1.b.(i)(A) below, to provide proof of current Tennessee residency as part of the \nProcess. The proof presented in this regard on behalf of the Potential Class Member must be \nsufficient, as determined by the State, to establish the Potential Class Member’s current  \nTennessee residency. This may include, but is not limited to, any of the following in the \nPotential Class Member’s name or in the name  of a family member or other person with whom  \nthe Potential Class Member resides, along with a signed attestation from that person that the \nPotential Class Member lives at the specified address:  a lease or rental agreement or payment \nreceipt, a mortgage loan or payment receipt, property tax statement or utility receipt.  If at any \ntime during the Process, however, the State finds evidence that the Potential Class Member is not \na Tennessee resident, the State will provide to the Parties via email transmission the name(s) of  \nany such Potential Class Members.  The e-mail identifying the Potential Class Member(s) will \nalso include the nature of the proof of current residency in another State (e.g., receiving \nMedicaid in another State).  The first business day following the transmission date of the \nnotification email shall be referred to as the “Non-Current Resident of Tennessee Notice Date.”  \nThe Parties will have 30 calendar days from the Non-Current Resident of Tennessee Notice Date \n- 9 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 10 of 37    PageID\n 21732 \n     \nto submit to the State proof of current residency in Tennessee for any Potential Class Member on \nthe list. If, within 30 calendar days from the Non-Current Resident of Tennessee Notice Date, \nthe Parties fail to provide the State with proof of current residency in Tennessee, such Potential \nClass Members shall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington  \nclass and no further efforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process.  If the Parties \nprovide proof within the 30 day period, the State shall consider it in good faith and issue a \ndetermination relative to the same within fourteen (14) days.  If the State’s determination \ncontinues to be that the Potential Class Member is a resident of another State, it will notify the \nParties via e-mail transmission of such determination, and the Parties shall have seven (7) days to \ncontest that determination pursuant to Section II.A.4.i below.  If the Parties do not contest the \ndetermination within seven (7) days, the Potential Class Member(s) shall be finally and forever \nineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further efforts shall be undertaken \nby the State under this Process. \n    f.  The State will review all available information to identify Potential Class \nMembers who are deceased.  The State will provide to the Parties the name(s) of all Potential \nClass Members who are found to be deceased through review of that information or otherwise, \nincluding the date of death. Such Potential Class Members shall be finally and forever ineligible \nfor membership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further efforts shall be undertaken by the \nState under this Process. \n    g.  The State has limited information available to confirm when a person is \nincarcerated. If, at any point during the Process, information is received confirming that a \nPotential Class Member is incarcerated, the State will use reasonable efforts to notify the Parties \nvia e-mail transmission within five (5) business days thereof, including the facility in which the \n- 10 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 11 of 37    PageID\n 21733 \n     \nperson is incarcerated (“Incarceration Notice”).  Unless the Parties notify the State within thirty \n(30) days following the date of the Incarceration Notice that the Potential Class Member is no \nlonger incarcerated, such Potential Class Member will be removed from the List and shall be \nfinally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further efforts \nshall be undertaken by the State under this Process.  In the event that class counsel or any other \nParty provides information, within the required 30 day period, demonstrating that the Potential \nClass Member is no longer incarcerated, the Potential Class Member may continue in the Process \nbut in no event will the Potential Class Member receive or be entitled to any tolling or extension \nof any deadline in the Process as a result of his/her incarceration and/or the Incarceration Notice.    \n    h.  The process for determining whether a person meets Medicaid medical \n(i.e., level of care) eligibility for ICF/IID services shall proceed in accordance with federal and \nstate law and regulation. The process for determining whether a person would meet Medicaid \nfinancial eligibility shall be conducted in conjunction with the Department of Human Services, \nusing the same eligibility criteria and requirements that will be applied should the person be \nenrolled into the at-risk Arlington class and apply to receive waiver services.  \n    i.  In the event that the Parties disagree with the State’s determination that a \nPotential Class Member is ineligible for Class Membership by operation of the provisions of \nSections II.A.4.a through II.A.4.e, the sole and exclusive avenue to contest the State’s \ndetermination shall be by appeal to Magistrate Judge Vescovo under a standing Order of \nReference.  In the event that such a dispute arises, the Parties agree that it will be submitted to \nJudge Vescovo in accordance with expedited procedures she establishes.   The Magistrate \nJudge’s ruling regarding this dispute will be final and the parties hereby waive their rights to file \nan Objection with the District Court.  \n- 11 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 12 of 37    PageID\n 21734 \n     \nB.

The Potential Class Member (or his or  her conservator or healthcare contact, if \nknown and applicable) may, prior to the expiration of the initial 90 calendar day period, request a \none-time extension of 30 calendar days to gather the information.  Such request must be \nsubmitted in writing to the address specified in the NOA and received by the State prior to \nexpiration of the initial 90 calendar day period.  If a request for a 30-day extension is received by \nthe State within the initial 90 calendar day period, such extension will be granted.  The 30 \ncalendar days will be added to the initial 90 calendar day period for a total of 120 calendar days \n- 19 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 20 of 37    PageID\n 21742 \n     \nfrom the NOA to submit information needed to determine eligibility for enrollment in the at-risk \nArlington class.  \n  4.  The State will provide to the Parties via email transmission the identity of each \nPotential Class Member requesting a 30-day extension, and the new 120-day deadline (inclusive \nof the initial 90 calendar day period and the one-time 30 calendar day extension).

Except as provided in Section II.H below, if within 90 calendar days from the \nmail date of the NOA, or within 120 calendar days from the mail date of the NOA when a one-\ntime 30-day extension has been granted, a Potential Class Member fails to submit to the State the \ninformation needed to determine eligibility for the at-risk Arlington class, such Potential Class \nMember shall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and \nno further efforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process.   \nH. \t Setting a new clock when a more current mailing address is provided to the State \n  If, within 30 calendar days from the Unable to Reach Notice Date, the Parties submit to \nthe State a more current mailing address for the Potential Class Member (or his or her \nconservator or healthcare contact, if known and applicable): \n1. \t The current mailing address will be updated in the at-risk record. \n2.  A new notice will be mailed, setting a new 90-day clock by which the Potential \nClass Member must submit to DIDD all information required by the State to determine eligibility \nfor enrollment in the at-risk Arlington class.  \nI. \t Failure to respond to the notice of opportunity to apply to become a member of the \nat-risk Arlington class \n- 20 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 21 of 37    PageID\n 21743 \n     \n \n1.  If, at the conclusion of the 90 day period, a Potential Class Member (or his or her \nconservator or healthcare contact, if known and applicable) has not submitted any information or \nrequested an extension to submit information, all attempts to contact by the State will end.  \n  2.  The State will provide to the Parties via email transmission the identity of each \nPotential Class Member who failed to respond to the NOA within 90 days but for whom an \nextension was not requested. The first business day following the transmission date of the \nnotification email shall be referred to as the “Failed to Respond Notice Date.”   \n  3.  The Parties will have 30 calendar days from the Failed to Respond Notice Date to \ncontact Potential Class Members (or their conservators or other healthcare contacts, if known and \napplicable) and assist them in submitting the information needed to apply for membership in the \nat risk Arlington class. \n  4.  Except as provided in Section II.J below, if, within 30 calendar days from the \nFailed to Respond Notice Date, the State does not receive all of the information needed to \ndetermine eligibility for enrollment into the at-risk Arlington class, such Potential Class Member \nwill be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further \nefforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process. \nJ.  Opportunity to correct deficiencies in information submitted to DIDD  \n1.  If information is received by the State from a Potential Class Member within the \nallotted time—either when (a) a one-time 30 calendar day extension is requested; or (b) when the \nPotential Class Member has failed to respond and 30 additional calendar days have been \nprovided for the Parties to assist the Potential Class Member in submitting information, DIDD \nwill review the information to determine whether it is sufficient to determine eligibility for \nenrollment in the at-risk Arlington class. \n- 21 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 22 of 37    PageID\n 21744 \n     \n   2.  If DIDD believes that the information is insufficient, a second notice (a “Notice of  \nDeficiency”) will be issued to the Potential Class Member (or his or her conservator or  \nhealthcare contact, if known and applicable), identifying the deficiencies and the specific \ninformation that is still needed to determine eligibility for enrollment in the at-risk Arlington  \nclass. \n  3.  The Potential Class Member (or his or  her conservator or healthcare contact, if \nknown and applicable) will have at least 30 calendar days (pursuant to subparagraphs a. and b \nbelow) from the date the Notice of Deficiency is mailed to submit the remaining information to \nDIDD. \n    a.  If such deficient information is received prior to expiration of the initial \n90 calendar day period, the 30 calendar days to correct deficiencies shall be added to the initial \n90 calendar day period, such that every Potential Class Member (or his or her conservator or \nhealthcare contact, if know and applicable) will have at least 120 calendar days from the NOA to \nprovide all of the information needed to determine eligibility for enrollment in the at-risk \nArlington class.  \n    b.  If such deficient information is received after expiration of the initial 90 \ncalendar day period, but prior to expiration of the one-time 30 calendar day extension or during \nthe 30 day period following the Failed to Respond Notice Date during which the Parties may \nassist Potential Class Members in submitting information, the 30 calendar days will be provided \nfrom the date of notice of deficiency. \n  4.  A copy of the Notice of Deficiency shall be provided to the Parties via email \ntransmission.  The Parties may assist the Potential Class Member (or his or her conservator or \n- 22 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 23 of 37    PageID\n 21745 \n     \nhealthcare contact, if known and applicable) in gathering the information that is still needed to \ndetermine eligibility for enrollment in the at-risk Arlington class.  \n  5.  If, within 30 calendar days (applied pursuant to Section II.J.3 above) the State \ndoes not receive the remaining information needed to determine eligibility for enrollment into \nthe at-risk Arlington class, such Potential Class Member shall be finally and forever ineligible for  \nmembership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further efforts shall be undertaken by the State \nunder this Process. \nK.  Scheduling the PAE assessment \n  1.  If DIDD determines that the information submitted by a Potential Class Member \nis sufficient to determine eligibility for enrollment in the at-risk Arlington class, the team will \ncontact the Potential Class Member (or his or her conservator or healthcare contact, if known and \napplicable) to arrange an appointment to conduct an assessment and complete a PAE \n(PreAdmission Evaluation or level of care) application.  \n  2.  The Intake Case Manager will contact the Potential Class Member (and his or her \nconservator or other healthcare contact, if known and applicable) to schedule an appointment to \ncomplete a PAE assessment.   The Intake Case  Manager will advise the Potential Class Member \n(and his or her conservator or other healthcare contact, if known) that such appointment must be \nscheduled and completed within no more than 30 calendar days from the date of the contact \n(unless extended by the State if at-risk intake team staff are not able to accommodate during the \n30 day period), absent exceptional circumstances (e.g., the Potential Class Member’s \nhospitalization). Any extension of the 30-day appointment time, including the reasons for such \nextension, must be documented in writing by DIDD.  If the Intake Case Manager is unable to \nreach the Potential Class Member (and his or her conservator or other healthcare contact, if \n- 23 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 24 of 37    PageID\n 21746 \n     \nknown) to schedule the PAE appointment, the appointment will be scheduled by the State and \nnotice of the appointment date will be communicated by mail to the Potential Class Member at \nthe most current address in the At-Risk record with a copy being provided to class counsel.  If \nthe Potential Class Member fails to appear for the PAE appointment, and does not contact the \nIntake Case Manager to arrange an alternative appointment to occur within 30 days from the date \nthe initial appointment was mailed to the Potential Class Member such Potential Class Member \nshall be finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class and no further \nefforts shall be undertaken by the State under this Process \nL.  Submitting the PAE to TennCare  \nUpon completion of the PAE assessment, all of the information will be forwarded to \nTennCare for review, and a determination will be made within 8 working days of receipt. \nM.  Notice of TennCare’s ICF/IID level of care eligibility determination \n  1.  The Potential Class Member (and his or her conservator or other healthcare \ncontact, if known and applicable) will be notified in writing of TennCare’s decision regarding \nICF/IID level of care eligibility.  \n  2.  A copy of the notice will be provided to the Parties by the State.  \n  3.  If the PAE is denied, the notice will include an explanation of the Potential Class \nMember’s due process rights.  These rights include the right to request a review of the decision \nin Tennessee Chancery Court and any appeal therefrom authorized by Tennessee law.  No other \nappeal or review of TennCare’s determination will be provided. \n  4.  Notwithstanding a waiting list for enrollment into the State’s Section 1915(c) \nwaivers for persons with intellectual disabilities, if a PAE appeal submitted as part of this at-risk \nprocess and in accordance with the process and timeframes described herein is decided in favor \n- 24 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 25 of 37    PageID\n 21747 \n     \nof a Potential Class Member (either before or after the dismissal of this case), the Potential Class \nMember would be entitled to enroll in the appropriate Section 1915(c) waiver if requested within \n30 days of the final order approving the PAE. \nN.  Notice of DHS’s preliminary determination of Medicaid eligibility  \n  1.  The Potential Class Member (and his or her conservator or other healthcare \ncontact, if known and applicable) will be notified in writing of DHS’s preliminary decision \nregarding whether a Potential Class Member would meet Medicaid financial eligibility.  This is a \npreliminary (and not final) eligibility determination since, pursuant to 42 CFR 435.217, unless \nthe Potential Class Member would qualify in another Medicaid category, s/he cannot actually \nqualify for and be enrolled into Medicaid in the Institutional eligibility category until such time \nthat s/he will be enrolled in a Section 1915(c) waiver and begin receiving HCBS. \n  2.  As this is a preliminary decision made to accommodate determination of \neligibility for enrollment into the at-risk Arlington class and not a final administrative action, \nthere is no right to fair hearing if a person is found to not meet Medicaid financial eligibility \nrequirements.   \n  3.  However, in the event a Potential Class Member is found to not meet Medicaid \nfinancial eligibility requirements, a notice will be provided to the Potential Class Member (and \nhis or her conservator or healthcare contact, if known and applicable) including the specific \nreasons s/he would not qualify, with opportunity to request an informal administrative review by \nDHS regarding any valid factual dispute.   \n  4.  A copy of any such notice that a Potential Class Member would not meet \n\nMedicaid financial eligibility requirements shall be provided to the Parties by the State. \n\nO.

The Potential Class Member will be removed from the List and all attempts by the \nState to contact and/or facilitate application for enrollment into the Arlington class will end; \n  2.  A copy of the signed form will be provided to the Parties; \n  3.  The Parties may follow-up to confirm that the person’s rights are understood, and \nthat the Potential Class Member (or his or her conservator or healthcare contact, if known and \napplicable) does not want to apply for membership in the Arlington class; \n  4.  If, within 30 calendar days of receipt of a signed form from the State, the Parties \nprovide signed documentation to the State from the Potential Class Member (or his or her \nconservator or healthcare contact, if known and applicable) that he or she has changed their mind \nand wishes to continue applying to become a member of the Arlington class, the initial 90-day \nclock will resume from the point where it was stopped, allowing any remaining time during \nwhich the Potential Class Member must submit to DIDD all information required by the State to \ndetermine eligibility for enrollment in the at-risk Arlington class (including all applicable \nextensions).  A Potential Class Member is only entitled to stop the running of the period of time \nfor submission of the information required by the State to determine eligibility for enrollment in \nthe at-risk Arlington class pursuant to this provision one time. \n- 26 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 27 of 37    PageID\n 21749 \n     \nP. \t Future opportunity to apply for waivers but not to become a member of the \n\nArlington class \n\n \nPotential Class Members who have been removed from the List may apply for waiver \nservices at any time.  However, once a Potential Class Member is removed from the List, he shall \nbe finally and forever ineligible for membership in the at-risk Arlington class. Any subsequent \nwaiver application will be considered in accordance with applicable TennCare and DIDD \npolicies and procedures for waiver enrollment, including those  pertaining to management of \nwaiting lists. Provided, further, however, that those persons who were eliminated from the List \nbecause of their enrollment in waiver services will be allowed to receive additional waiver \nservices as their needs may dictate (e.g. moving from the Self Determination Waiver to the Main \nor ADC waiver) without being placed on a waiting list for such services and pursuant to \nestablished processes. \nSection III – Class Members in Nursing Facilities  \nA.  DIDD will complete a needs assessment for each current class member living in a \nnursing home. Based on the results of the needs assessment, DIDD will determine, through a \nthree-person committee of qualified professionals appointed by DIDD and exercising their \nprofessional judgment, whether it is appropriate for the class member to be served in the \ncommunity if he or she (or his or her authorized health care decision maker) so chooses.  DIDD \nwill use reasonable and ordinary efforts to report its determination to Plaintiffs’ counsel within \nfive business days of such determination.  Notwithstanding a determination by DIDD that it is \nnot appropriate for the class member to be served in the community, if Plaintiff’s counsel \nreceives a statement from the affected class member, or his/her healthcare decision maker, that \nthe affected person desires to move from the nursing facility, the Plaintiff shall provide the State \nwith a written statement within 30 days of the State’s notice of determination to the Plaintiffs.  If, \n- 27 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 28 of 37    PageID\n 21750 \n     \nand only if, the State receives a written statement within this 30-day period from a class member, \nor on behalf of the class member from his or her authorized health care decision maker or \nPlaintiff’s counsel, advising the State that the affected class member desires to move from the \nnursing facility, the State shall assign the affected class member an Independent Support \nCoordinator (“ISC”) pursuant to the provisions of Section III.B. below.  \n  B.  The State will provide an ISC to any current class member living in a nursing \nhome who DIDD has determined, in its professional judgment, may be appropriately served in \nthe community if he or she (or his or her authorized health care decision maker) so chooses.  For \na period of up to but no longer than 60 days, the ISC will assist the class member (and his or her \nauthorized health care decision maker) in making an educated choice as to whether he or she \nwishes to remain in the nursing home or transition to a community placement.  If the class \nmember (or his or her authorized health care decision maker) decides he or she does not wish to \ntransition to a community placement and the ISC informs the State in writing, the ISC services \nwill cease.  If the class member (or his or her authorized health care decision maker) or the ISC \ninforms the State in writing prior to the expiration of the 60-day decision period that he or she \nhas decided to transition to a community placement, the ISC will continue working with the class \nmember to assist the class member in transitioning to the community.  The State shall direct ISCs \nto attend available plan of care meetings that occur during each ISC’s work with class members \nin nursing facilities, provided the ISCs are aware of the date and time such meetings are \nscheduled, are available to attend the meetings when they are scheduled, and are not requested to \ndesist from attending such scheduled meetings.  The State shall not request that an assigned ISC \ndesist from attending such scheduled meetings.  The State shall report at monthly meetings with \nthe Magistrate Judge the status of class member transitions.   \n- 28 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 29 of 37    PageID\n 21751 \n     \n  C.  The State will provide a conservator or other authorized power of attorney or \nhealth care surrogate to any current class member living in a nursing home whom DIDD has \ndetermined, in its professional judgment, may be appropriately served in the community if he or \nshe (or his or her authorized health care decision maker) so chooses if, and only if:  (1) it is \ndetermined that the class member is not competent; (2) the class member does not have a \nconservator, or a health care decision maker with a power of attorney or health care surrogate \nauthorization (provided that, except for direct family members, such person is not employed by \nthe nursing facility); and (3) does not have a family member or other person willing to serve in \nthis role.  \n  D.  The parties understand and agree that:  (1) any class member (or his or her \nauthorized health care decision maker) who has chosen to transition to the community pursuant \nto the procedures set forth in Section III.B. above may, at any time, change his or her mind and \ndecide to remain in the nursing home; and (2) the State cannot guarantee that any such transition \nwill be completed before December 31, 2013 (or by any other deadline).   \n  E.  With respect to any persons who:  (1) become class members in 2013, and (2) are \nliving in a nursing home, the State will follow the procedures set forth in Sections III.A. through \nIII.D. above,  provided that, the parties understand and agree that the State cannot guarantee that \nany of the procedures set forth in Sections III.A. through III.D. will be completed by December \n31, 2013, and thus is not required to complete said procedures by December 31, 2013, for \npersons who became class members in 2013. \n  F.  The State shall arrange for the provision of specialized services to class members \nresiding in nursing facilities that receive Medicaid funds through TennCare consistent with the \nrequirements contained in 42 CFR 483.120 (incorporating the requirements of 42 CFR \n- 29 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 30 of 37    PageID\n 21752 \n     \n483.440(a)(1)). This requirement shall be satisfied in full if the State’s contracts with its nursing \nfacility providers require that they comply with federal Medicaid regulations applicable to \nnursing facilities. \n  G.  The failure to complete any transition of any class member who has elected to \nmove from a nursing facility prior to December 31, 2013, or any other deadline shall not \nconstitute a failure to comply with a material provision of this Exit Plan that would justify the \ncontinuation of this case.  The State will continue with the transition of any class member that \nhas elected community placement from a nursing facility notwithstanding the dismissal of this \ncase, but will not prohibit class members from  exercising their freedom of choice should they \nchange their election of placement. \nSection IV – Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities  \nBy no later than July 1, 2013, the Bureau of TennCare, the Department of Health, and \nDIDD will enter into a written agreement (the “Interdepartmental Agreement”) providing that \nDIDD will serve as a subcontractor to the Department of Health to undertake certain survey, \ncertification, and enforcement functions of the State Survey Agency specified in 42 C.F.R. \n§ 488.11, currently performed by the Department of Health, for the State’s privately-operated \nICF/IIDs, to meet the conditions of participation specified in federal law and regulation at 42 \nC.F.R. § 483 et seq. The Parties understand that the Interdepartmental Agreement will provide \nfor an adequate transition period, as determined necessary by the State, to assure compliance \nwith Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) requirements.   In addition, by no \nlater than September 1, 2013, DIDD will develop a system for publicly rating the quality of the \nState’s privately-operated ICF/IIDs and a plan for implementing that system.  The State intends, \nby December 31, 2013, to pilot the proposed rating system, using available and existing data at \n- 30 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 31 of 37    PageID\n 21753 \n     \nthat time, provided however, the Parties agree that failure to conduct the pilot prior to December \n31, 2013 shall not constitute a failure to complete a material provision of this Exit Plan.  \nSection V – Waiver Renewal and Amendment  \nA.  The State has requested that CMS approve:  (1) an amendment to the Statewide \nHome and Community-Based Services Waiver for the Intellectually and Developmentally \nDisabled that would permit the State to cover Intensive Behavioral Residential Services (the \n“IBRS amendment”); and (2) a renewal of  the Self Determination Waiver that would permit the \nState to cover Semi-Independent Living Services for enrollees in the Self Determination Waiver \n(the “SDW renewal”).  Upon approval by CMS, and only in the event such approval is obtained \non or before October 1, 2013, the State shall begin implementation of both the Intensive \nBehavioral Residential Services model of care and the Semi-Independent Living Services model \nof care. If CMS does not approve the IBRS amendment on or before October 1, 2013, the failure \nto comply with Section V.B. below shall not constitute a failure to comply with a material  \nprovision of this Exit Plan that would justify the continuation of this case.  If CMS does not \napprove the SDW renewal on or before October 1, 2013, the failure to comply with Section V.C. \nbelow shall not constitute a failure to comply with a material provision of this Exit Plan that \nwould justify the continuation of this case.  \n  B.  If CMS approves the State’s IBRS amendment on or before October 1, 2013, the \nState’s implementation requirement shall be satisfied upon the State: (1) developing and \npublishing the criteria for selection for participation in the Intensive Behavioral Residential \nServices model of care; (2) appointing members to an admissions committee that shall make \neligibility determinations for the Intensive Behavioral Residential Services model of care; and \n(3) executing or amending contracts with qualified service providers for the initial participants in \n- 31 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 32 of 37    PageID\n 21754 \n     \nthe Intensive Behavioral Residential Services model of care based on the need and demand for \nthe Intensive Behavioral Residential Services model of care.   \n  C.  If CMS approves the State’s SDW renewal or a waiver amendment for the \naddition of the Semi-Independent Living Services model of care to the Self-Determination \nWaiver on or before October 1, 2013, the State’s implementation requirement shall be satisfied \nupon the State: (1) developing and publishing the criteria for selection for participation in the \nSemi-Independent Living Services model of care; and (2) executing or amending contracts with \nqualified service providers for the initial participants in the Semi-Independent Living Services \nmodel of care based on the need and demand for the Semi-Independent Living Services model of \ncare.  \n  D.  The State will continue with the implementation of the Intensive Behavioral \nResidential Services model of care if it is approved by CMS after October 1, 2013, \nnotwithstanding the dismissal of this case.  The State will continue with the implementation of \nthe Semi-Independent Living Services model of care if it is approved by CMS after October 1, \n2013, notwithstanding the dismissal of this case. \nSection VI – Class Member Employment  \nDuring the pendency of the case, DIDD will continue to develop meaningful and real \nopportunities for class members to obtain competitive employment, supported work, and/or \nvolunteer jobs in the communities by taking the following steps and/or continuing the following \nactions: \nA.  The State will continue to implement the Subcontract Agreement between \nEconomic Systems Inc. (“ESI”) and the State of Tennessee, Agreement Number 12-TN-0503-P1 \n(the “Grant Contract”), which is a subcontract to the State of Tennessee under ESI’s prime \n- 32 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 33 of 37    PageID\n 21755 \n     \ncontract with the Department of Labor relative to ESI’s prime contract with the Department of \nLabor, Office of Disability Employment. \n  B.  DIDD will retain expert consultants, through the Grant Contract, to provide \ntechnical assistance to DIDD about, among other things, the structure for discovering if a person \nreceiving services from DIDD is interested in working (e.g., the Discovery Process) and, if so, \nthe jobs they are interested in pursuing. \nC.  By no later than October 1, 2013, DIDD will require all state case managers \nand/or independent support coordinators who write individual support plans (“ISPs”) to begin \nincluding in each class member’s ISP, upon the next annual review or amendment thereto, a \nstatement regarding the class member’s desire to work.   \nD.  By no later than October 1, 2013, DIDD will ensure that its Quality Assurance \nprocess includes a check to ensure that the class member ISPs reviewed through QA include a \nstatement regarding whether a class member has expressed a desire to work and, if yes, whether \nthe supports necessary to  facilitate the employment, if any, are identified.  \nE.  DIDD will modify its “Day Services  Protocol” and “Day Services Protocol \nChecklist” to be titled the “Employment and Day Services Protocol” and “Employment and Day \nServices Protocol Checklist” respectively.  DIDD will add a statement to the Employment and \nDay Services Protocol indicating that, where appropriate, employment is preferred over Day \nServices. Consistent with, and subject to, the medical necessity requirements of that protocol, \nthe State shall provide class members supported employment services as justified in class \nmembers’ ISP. \nF.  DIDD will continue to offer job coach training programs through DIDD approved \nweb-based training. \n- 33 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 34 of 37    PageID\n 21756 \n     \nG.  DIDD will continue to provide the parties with, and begin providing to Magistrate \nJudge Vescovo, quarterly employment reports (in the same format as the State has provided \nsince 2007), with the next report scheduled to be provided on or about February 4, 2013, with \ninformation regarding the months of October, November and December, 2012. \nSection VII – Arlington Developmental Center Grounds  \nA.  DIDD has submitted a funding request in its FY 2014 budget (for funding use \nbeginning July 1, 2013) for the demolition of all residential cottages on the grounds of Arlington \nDevelopmental Center (“ADC”) except those attached to the Baker Building, which shall not be \nused for residential purposes. Upon approval of such funding request, DIDD, with the assistance \nof the Real Estate Asset Management division of the Department of General Services \n(“STREAM”), will develop a plan for the demolition of these cottages, including information \nregarding the work to be performed, for submission to the State Building Commission for \napproval to proceed with the plan for demolition.  \n  B.  DIDD, with the assistance of STREAM, shall develop a plan for the proposed sale \nof the ADC property (excluding the Baker Administrative Building and Resource Center, the \nland immediately adjacent thereto that is necessary for setback, and land necessary to provide \naccess to that portion of the property for public right of way; land set aside for the West  \nTennessee Community Homes; land that is the subject of any lease between the State of  \nTennessee and the City of Arlington; land that is subject to any existing easements; and any other \nland necessary for the foregoing) (the “Property”) or portions thereof.  By December 31, 2013, \nSTREAM shall determine whether the Property may be categorized as surplus, pursuant to \nTennessee Code Annotated § 12-2-112.  If the Property is confirmed as surplus, DIDD will work \nwith STREAM to obtain the approval of the State Building Commission for the sale of the \n- 34 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 35 of 37    PageID\n 21757 \n     \nProperty.  DIDD will endeavor in good faith to obtain such approval and to obtain appraisal(s)  \nof the Property by December 31, 2013, but its failure to obtain said approval and/or said \nappraisals by that date shall not be considered a material breach of this agreement.  In addition, \nnotwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed to require DIDD to sell the \nProperty during 2013 or at any other date prior to:  (1) DIDD’s determination that any sale price \nfor the Property maximizes the return on the sale of the Property to DIDD; and (2) the approval \nof the sale of the Property by the State Building Commission, the Attorney General, and the \nGovernor, in accordance with all applicable laws, policies and procedures, including, without \nlimitation, the State Building Commission Policy and Procedures. \n \n- 35 -\n\n\nCase 2:92-cv-02062-JPM-tmp   Document 2941   Filed 01/17/13   Page 36 of 37    PageID\n 21758 \n     \nAGREED TO: \nOn Behalf of the United States of America: \nEDWARD  L.

Ross, Asst. Attys. Gen., Nashville, Tenn.,\nfor defendants.\nORDER DENYING MOTION TO DISMISS OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nMcCALLA, District Judge.\nThis cause came on before the Court on Defendants' motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary\njudgment, filed March 4, 1992. By memorandum filed on June 17, 1992, the plaintiff requested an expedited\nhearing or ruling. Accordingly, the Court held a hearing on the motion on July 24, 1992.\nThis case involves alleged unconstitutional conditions of confinement and federal statutory violations at the\nArlington Developmental Center (\"Arlington\") located in Arlington, Tennessee, pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 1980 (\"CRIPA\"). The defendants assert numerous reasons to support their motion\nto dismiss, but the essence of their argument is that the acts or omissions complained of do not implicate\nconstitutional rights. For the reasons stated below, this Court disagrees and the motion to dismiss or in the\nalternative for summary judgment is, therefore, denied.\nThe defendants' motion to dismiss specifically raises the following six issues for determination by this Court: (1)\nWhether constitutional rights, privileges, or immunities are implicated by the acts or omissions alleged by the\nplaintiff pursuant to CRIPA; (2) Whether the number of residents who reside at the institution as a result of state\naction is sufficient to support an action pursuant to CRIPA; (3) Whether the facts as alleged in the complaint are\nsufficient to support the claim that the defendants are depriving the residents of Arlington, who are under the age\nof 22 years, a free appropriate public education pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq. (\"IDEA\"); (4) Whether the\nallegations in the complaint are sufficient to support the filing of suit by the Attorney General pursuant to CRIPA;\n(5) Whether the suit is an impressible attempt to impose standards in excess of the constitutional minima\ncontemplated under CRIPA; and (6) Whether the certification (pre-filing) requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(2)\nhave been complied with. Each one of these contentions will be dealt with in turn.\nThe defendants first and foremost argument is that the residents of Arlington, with a few exceptions, have been\nplaced at the institution at the requests of their parents or guardians, and thus the state has not used its\ngovernmental power to force the residents to come to Arlington (such as when residents are committed by order\nof the court) or its power to require them to remain there. Since the state has not acted affirmatively in placing the\nresidents at Arlington and given that there are no allegations that the state is \"abusing its power\" or \"employing its\npower as an instrument of oppression,\" substantive due process rights are not triggered. Additionally, the\ndefendants aver that the residents of Arlington, placed there by parents or guardians, do not have \"constitutional\"\n486 rights to safe conditions or a certain standard of care, but that those residents are *486 owed a duty of care under\n[1]\nstate tort law.\n\nThe plaintiff on the other hand argues that there is sufficient affirmative state action such that all residents are\nentitled to basic constitutional rights as enumerated in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73\nL.Ed.2d 28 (1982), which include food, shelter, clothing, reasonable safety and minimum levels of training. The\nplaintiff stresses that the Arlington residents have been confined there by affirmative state action; that they are\nunder the custody and control of the state pursuant to state statute (Tenn.Code Ann. § 33-5-103); that they reside\nin a state-owned facility where they are totally dependent on the state for their well-being; and that they are\nsubject to significant restraints on liberty that are imposed by the state.\nUnder the standard of review for a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, all factual allegations in the\ncomplaint are taken as true and all reasonable inferences are resolved in favor of the plaintiff. Dismissal is only\nappropriate if it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim which\nwould entitle him or her to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); \nAng v. Procter & Gamble Co., 932 F.2d 540, 541 (6th Cir. 1991).\nGenerally, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not confer an affirmative right to\ngovernmental aid, DeShaney v. Winnebago County DSS, 489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1003, 103 L.Ed.2d\n249 (1989), \"even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the\ngovernment itself may not deprive the individual.\" Id. See, also, Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 317, 102\nS.Ct. 2452, 2459, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) (\"As a general matter, a State is under no constitutional duty to provide\nsubstantive services for those within its border\"). However, under certain circumstances the state has a duty to\nprovide services and care to institutionalized individuals.\nWhen a person is institutionalized 00 and wholly dependent on the State 00 it is conceded by\n97 97\n[2]\npetitioners that a duty to provide certain services and care does exist....\n[3]\nYoungberg at 317, 102 S.Ct. at 2459.  The Supreme Court, in a subsequent decision, explained the reasoning\nfor this principle as follows:\n[4]\nThe rationale for this principle  is simple enough: when the State by the affirmative exercise of\nits power so restrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at\n487 the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs 00 e.g., food, clothing, shelter, *487\n97\nmedical care, and reasonable safety 00 it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by\n97\nthe Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.\nDeShaney 109 S.Ct. at 1005-1006. It is the state's affirmative action of restraining the individual's freedom to act\non his or her own behalf through institutionalization which is the \"deprivation of liberty\" triggering the protections\n[5]\nof the Due Process Clause. Id. at 1006.\nAlthough the vast majority of residents at Arlington were placed there at the request of their parents or guardians,\nas opposed to a court commitment procedure, it is reasonable to infer from the facts as alleged that there is\nsufficient state action in the process used to admit residents into the facility to trigger substantive due process\n[6]\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2503, 61\nL.Ed.2d 101 (1979) (\"It is not disputed that a child, in common with adults, has a substantial liberty interest in not\nbeing confined unnecessarily for medical treatment and that the state's involvement in the commitment decision\n[7]\nconstitutes state action under the Fourteenth Amendment\").  Also, under Tennessee law, once an individual is\nconfined to Arlington the mentally retarded person is under the \"exclusive care, custody and control of the\ncommissioner and superintendent.\" Tenn.Code Ann. § 33-5-103. Once the state has accepted the individual into\nits custody and control, the state has assumed some responsibility for the safety and well-being of the resident. \nSee DeShaney 109 S.Ct. at 1005. Moreover, the alleged harm is caused by state actors who control every aspect\n[8]\nof the resident's daily life, including treatment, care and his or her movement in and out of the institution.\nSince the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of violations of substantive rights, dismissal is not\nappropriate. Further, when reviewing the submitted materials under a motion for summary judgment, the\ndefendants motion must likewise fail.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is proper\nIf the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\naffidavits, if any, show that there are no genuine issues as to any material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91\nL.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In considering a motion for summary judgment \"the evidence as well as the inferences\ndrawn therefrom must be read in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\" Kochins v. Linden-\nAlimak, Inc., 799 F.2d 1128, 1133 (6th Cir.1986).\nIn the instant case the defendants have failed to show that there are no genuine issues of material fact. There is\ninsufficient information in the record for this Court to make a determination regarding the extent of any\nunconstitutional conditions, if any. Summary judgment is, therefore, not proper.\nAlthough the defendants concede that there are approximately 10-12 residents who are in the legal custody of\nthe state, i.e., court committed, and who have constitutionally protected rights, the defendants argue that the\nnumber of such residents is insufficient to support an action under CRIPA. This argument is not persuasive.\n488 CRIPA does not contain any restrictions *488 which outline a minimum number of residents who must be affected\nprior to the Attorney General bringing suit. CRIPA simply gives standing for the Attorney General to file suit if he\nhas reasonable cause to believe specific things, e.g., that residents in state institutions are being deprived of their\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights. Since there is no minimum number of residents required under CRIPA,\nthe defendants' argument must fail.\nThe defendants next contend that the facts alleged in the complaint are insufficient to support the claim that the\ndefendants are depriving the residents of Arlington a free appropriate public education, rights secured by the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Act (\"IDEA,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq.). Secondly, the defendants assert that there\nare no allegations of an essential element of CRIPA, such as the \"pattern or practice\" requirement, or any\nauthority for the enforcement of IDEA in an action under CRIPA; and thirdly the defendants aver that the plaintiff\nhas failed to allege \"exhaustion of administrative remedies\" which is an essential requirement of the IDEA.\nThe plaintiff propounds that all residents at Arlington are mentally retarded, that mental retardation is a disability\nunder IDEA (20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(1)(A)), and that IDEA establishes an \"enforceable substantive right to a free\nappropriate public education\" for every child with a disability. The plaintiff's argument is well taken. The plaintiff\nhas set out sufficient facts upon which the claim is based and, therefore, the motion to dismiss under this\nargument is denied. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) (\"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader\nis entitled to relief\"). Whether the defendants have already appropriately evaluated the mentally retarded children\nat Arlington to identify their specific educational needs is a question of material fact precluding summary\njudgment.\nThe defendant's argument that the plaintiff has failed to allege an essential element of CRIPA is also unavailing.\nCRIPA is a standing statute. Pursuant to § 1997a, the Attorney General has certified, among other things, that the\ndefendants are depriving the residents of Arlington of their rights \"pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance\nto the full enjoyment of such rights.\" As long as the complaint is specific enough, as in the instant case, there is\nno need for the Attorney General to duplicate the contents of the certificate in the complaint.\nAdditionally, there is no indication of intent to exclude the IDEA from enforcement under CRIPA. CRIPA gives the\nAttorney General standing to sue when the institutional conditions deprive the residents of \"any rights, privileges,\nor immunities secured or protected by the constitution or laws of the United States.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a)\n(emphasis added).\nThere is also no requirement that the Attorney General exhaust administrative mechanisms set forth in IDEA prior\nto bringing suit in federal court. Only parents, guardians, and surrogate parents are required and entitled to utilize\nthe administrative procedures set out in IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415. The Attorney General is not authorized to do so.\n\nThe defendants fourth argument is that the complaint fails to state a claim under § 1997a. More specifically, the\ndefendants assert that the complaint fails to include specific facts which would support the following preconditions\nset out in § 1997a: (1) egregious or flagrant conditions; (2) any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or\nprotected by the Constitution or laws of the United States; (3) grievous harm; and (4) a causal connection\nbetween the egregious or flagrant conditions and the grievous harm and pattern or practice of resistance.\nAs agreed by all parties, CRIPA does not establish substantive rights, but only gives the Attorney General\nstanding to file suit to enforce constitutional or statutory violations. In light of the fact that the Attorney General\nhas certified that the \"preconditions\" to filing have been met, as stated in his certificate, there is no need under\n489 the facts in this case, to go behind the certificate *489 and require the plaintiff to justify his determinations.\nWhether the alleged conditions exist is precisely the question that this Court will determine after a hearing on the\nmerits.\nThe defendants fifth argument is that the suit is an impermissible attempt to impose standards in excess of the\nconstitutional minima contemplated under CRIPA. The defendants argue that since Arlington is certified as an\nIntermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (ICF/MR) there is a\npresumption that the conditions at Arlington are constitutional. \"It must be presumed that the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services would not set standards for health care providers, who are receiving reimbursement from\nthe federal government, below constitutional minima.\" Plaintiff Brief at 33, filed March 4, 1992. This Court is not\npersuaded.\nCertification does not guarantee that constitutional minima exist. See Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 673 F.Supp. 828, 841\n(N.D.Tex. 1987) (\"Surveyors examine whether policies and programs exist, not whether those policies or\nprograms result in adequate care\"). Additionally, facilities with serious deficiencies are allowed to provide a \"plan\nof correction\" and maintain their certification. Thus, certification is not equivalent to a legal presumption of\nconstitutional conditions, although it may provide some evidence on that point.\nThe defendants final argument is that the \"preconditions\" or \"pre-filing\" requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(2)\nhave not been complied with. As stated above, the defendants have not presented this Court with sufficient facts\nto warrant any further inquiry into the \"pre-filing\" conditions attested to in the certificate. Therefore, the\ndefendants claim must fail with respect to this issue.\nAccordingly, the defendants' motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment is hereby DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Suit against the state would be available via the Tennessee Claims Commission established pursuant to\nTenn.Code Ann. § 9-8-301 et seq.\n[2] Although this duty exists, the state has discretion in determining the \"nature and scope of its responsibilities.\" \nYoungberg at 317, 102 S.Ct. at 2459.\n[3]Youngberg involved the substantive rights of involuntarily committed mentally retarded persons under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The respondent in that case, who had been committed under the\nlaws of Pennsylvania, did not challenge the commitment, but rather asserted that he had a constitutionally\nprotected liberty interest in safety, freedom of movement and training and that the petitioners had infringed on\nthose rights by failing to provide constitutionally required conditions of confinement. Youngberg at 314-315, 102\nS.Ct. at 2457-2458. The Court determined that the respondent had constitutionally protected interests in\nconditions of reasonable care and safety, reasonable nonrestrictive confinement conditions, and such training as\nmay be required by these interests. Id. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. In dicta the Court stated that the essentials of\nthe care were \"adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.\" Id.\n[4] As stated in Youngberg, the principle is the state's duty to provide certain services and care when a person is\ninstitutionalized. See DeShaney, 109 S.Ct. at 1005. In DeShaney the Court harmonized the principle stated in \nYoungberg with that articulated in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), as well\nas other opinions, and acknowledged the importance of custody. \n\nWhen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes\nupon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.\nDeShaney, 109 S.Ct. at 1005.\n[5] Although the Court in DeShaney determined that the analysis under Youngberg and Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) had no applicability in its present case, the analysis is instructive in\nthe case sub judice.\n[6] Apparently, the Superintendent of Arlington may deny a request for admission pursuant to Tenn.Code Ann. §\n33-6-103.\n[7] Although the Parham case was a challenge to Georgia's procedures for voluntary commitment of children\nunder the age of 18 to state mental hospitals, the Court recognized the substantial liberty interests involved when\nan individual is confined.\n[8] Under Tenn.Code Ann. § 33-5-101(6), the Superintendent of Arlington may deny a person's request for\ndischarge from the facility.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Community Rehabilitation\nAgencies of Tennessee (CMRA) appeals the decisions of the two district courts that denied its petitions to\nintervene as a matter of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). Because CMRA's petitions are\nuntimely and it has not advanced any substantial right to intervene, its appeals are denied.\n591  I. BACKGROUND\n*591\nCMRA is an association of nonprofit agencies that provide services to retarded persons and those with mental\ndisabilities in community placements. These services include case management, residential medical support,\nsupported living, transportation, day services, and other services. CMRA represents the interests of the\ncommunity-based service provider industry in legislative, executive, and judicial matters. CMRA has 75 members,\nincluding most of the community agencies in the State of Tennessee. The vast majority of these community\nagencies is nonprofit, formed in local communities, and receives funding from the State and federal government.\nCMRA appeals the decisions of Judge Robert L. Echols in People First of Tennessee v. Clover Bottom\nDevelopmental Center and Judge Jon P. McCalla in United States v. State of Tennessee, that denied its motions\n[1]\nto intervene in the present litigation.  The two cases have been consolidated for purposes of this appeal. The\nunderlying lawsuits were brought by the United States and private plaintiffs against the State of Tennessee\nregarding the operation of its mental health system. In each case, CMRA alleged in its petition that the State of\nTennessee had violated the constitutional and statutory rights of individuals who are mentally retarded and\ndevelopmentally disabled. It attempted to intervene as of right and permissively in both cases pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and 24(b). CMRA only appeals the decisions that denied them the ability to\nintervene as of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a).\nWe will rely on the ample factual background provided in previous opinions in these two cases to describe the\nevents leading up to CMRA's attempt to intervene. See United States v. State of Tennessee, 181 F.3d 105\n(Table), 1999 WL 357785 (6th Cir.1999); People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., 145 F.3d 1332\n(Table), 1998 WL 246146 (6th Cir.1998); United States v. State of Tennessee, 925 F.Supp. 1292 (W.D.Tenn.\n1995); People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., 878 F.Supp. 97 (W.D.Tenn.1992).\nII. ANALYSIS\nCMRA contends that it was improperly denied the right to intervene in the two cases pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 24(a). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), an outsider may intervene as of right:\nUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action ... when the applicant\nclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the\n\napplicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as practical matter impair or impede\nthe applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately\nrepresented by existing parties.\nThe criteria that must be satisfied before intervention as of right will be granted are: (1) timeliness of the\napplication to intervene, (2) the applicant's substantial legal interest in the case, (3) impairment of the applicant's\n592 ability to protect that interest in the absence of intervention, and (4) inadequate representation of that interest \n*592 by parties already before the court. See Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th\nCir.1997).\nA district court's denial of intervention as of right is reviewed de novo, except for the timeliness element, which is\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1999) (citing Jansen v.\nCity of Cincinnati, 904 F.2d 336, 340 (6th Cir.1990)).\nA.Timeliness\nCMRA contends that now is the appropriate time to intervene and that it filed its motions timely because it learned\nshortly prior to bringing its motions that its interests were not being represented by the existing parties. We have\nidentified several factors to be established in determining whether a request for intervention is timely:\n(1) the point to which the suit has progressed; (2) the purpose for which intervention is sought; (3)\nthe length of time preceding the application during which the proposed intervenor knew or\nreasonably should have known of his interest in the case; (4) the prejudice to the original parties\ndue to the proposed intervenor's failure, after he or she knew or reasonably should have known of\nhis interest in the case, to apply promptly for intervention; and (5) the existence of unusual\ncircumstances militating against or in favor of intervention.\nGrubbs v. Norris, 870 F.2d 343, 345 (6th Cir.1989). \"The determination of whether a motion to intervene is timely\nshould be evaluated in the context of all relevant circumstances.\" Jansen, 904 F.2d at 340. We will find an abuse\nof discretion only when left with the \"definite and firm conviction that the court ... committed a clear error of\njudgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors\" or where it \"improperly applies the\nlaw or uses an erroneous legal standard.\" Huey v. Stine, 230 F.3d 226, 228 (6th Cir.2000) (citations and internal\nquotations omitted).\n1. Stage of the Proceeding\nCMRA contends that the district judges abused their discretion when they denied the motions to intervene. CMRA\nargues it did not become aware of its independent interest to intervene until the implementation of the settlement\nagreements required its members to provide community-based services to individuals without a guarantee of\nsufficient payment by the State of Tennessee. CMRA cites to Grubbs and Linton v. Commissioner, 973 F.2d 1311\n(6th Cir.1992), for the proposition that intervenors can timely appeal during the remedial stages of a consent\ndecree. See Grubbs supra; Linton, supra.\nWe have recently stated that the time of intervention is not the determining factor but rather that \"all\ncircumstances\" must be examined to determine the substantive progress that has occurred in the litigation. See \nStupak-Thrall v. Glickman, 226 F.3d 467, 475 (6th Cir.2000) (\"The propriety of intervention in any given case,\nhowever, must be measured under `all circumstances' of that particular case.\") (citing NAACP v. New York, 413\nU.S. 345, 366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2603, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973)). If the litigation has \"made extensive progress in the\ndistrict court before the appellants moved to intervene\" then this factor weighs against intervention. Id.\nIn these cases, there was very little for either district judge to do when CMRA filed its petitions for intervention. In \nPeople First, Judge Echols had conditionally approved the initial settlement; the parties had prepared the\n593 Community Development Plan required by him. He had approved this plan, and the motion for *593 final approval\nof the settlement was already pending before him. In United States v. Tennessee, Judge McCalla had approved\nseveral remedial orders to bring the mental health system into compliance with the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\n\nPersons Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997) and had approved the Community Plan. All substantive issues had been resolved\nby both judges at the time of CMRA's filing for intervention and all that was required was final approval by the\njudges. This factor weighs strongly against allowing intervention by CMRA. See Stupak-Thrall, 226 F.3d at 475.\n2. Purpose of the Intervention\nCMRA states that it simply requests the opportunity to be an active party in future remedial proceedings. CMRA\nwould like the opportunity to participate in the implementation of the settlement agreements, to advocate and\nprotect the regulatory and economic interests of community providers and to assure that sufficient other\nresources are provided in the community in a timely manner so that individuals receive timely and appropriate\nservices. CMRA contends that throughout the remedial phase the courts and the parties will address matters\nwhich will directly implicate the scope, quality, timing and funding of services to be performed by CMRA\nmembers.\nIn People First, Judge Echols found that this argument did not state an adequate \"purpose for the intervention.\"\nHe stated, \"Because it is the State's responsibility to assure that `resources are provided in the community' and\n`individuals receive timely and appropriate services,' intervention by CMRA would not accomplish these aims.\nFinally, should CMRA hope, through intervention, to obtain higher rates and fewer obligations for community\nproviders, this forum is not the appropriate forum to seek such relief.\"\nIn United States v. State of Tennessee, Judge McCalla held that \"These stated purposes do not rise to the level\nrequiring intervention.\" He held that, \"The State of Tennessee is responsible for ensuring that these interests are\nprotected and CMRA agencies are already participating in the implementation of the Remedial Order by providing\nservices to the class members.\"\nThe interests asserted by CMRA for seeking intervention are not compelling. This factor also weighs against a\nfinding of timely intervention.\n3. The length of time preceding the application during which the\nApplicant knew or should have known of its interest in the case.\nCMRA admits it knew of the litigation in both cases at all stages and it also knew that its members had an interest\nin the outcome of the litigation. It contends that it believed that the existing parties to the two cases adequately\nrepresented its interest initially, and thus, it was not required to intervene in the lawsuits. It now claims that it only\nrecently became apparent that these parties were not adequately representing its interest.\nIn People First, Judge Echols found that CMRA knew of the litigation at all stages and did not attempt to\nintervene when it knew that the interests of the community providers were affected by the litigation and proposed\nsettlement agreement. He stated:\nIt is undisputed that CMRA has been aware of the lawsuits, the time-consuming negotiations\nbetween the parties and interest groups, the disputed issues concerning the types, quality,\n594 location, and accessibility of the proposed community *594 health care services, along with the\ncritical role of the community health care providers in providing these services to the State of\nTennessee for the benefit of the Plaintiffs. Investigations, reports, judicial settlement conferences,\nand hearings have been conducted.\nHe held that this factor weighed against allowing intervention.\nIn United States v. State of Tennessee, Judge McCalla also found that this factor weighed against allowing\nCMRA to intervene. He stated:\nCMRA's interest developed, at the latest date, when the Community Plan was entered, which was\nin 1997. The fiscal crisis of the State and other referenced broken promises of the State do not\n\nchange the fact that CMRA's interests, even broadly construed, were apparent, at the latest date,\nwhen the Community Plan went into effect.\nHe held that CMRA waited too long before intervening.\nWe agree with the decisions of the district courts. An entity that is aware that its interests may be impaired by the\noutcome of the litigation is obligated to seek intervention as soon as it is reasonably apparent that it is entitled to\nintervene. See NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. at 367, 93 S.Ct. at 2604; Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co. v. Tracy, 6 F.3d\n389, 396 (6th Cir.1993); Stotts v. Memphis Fire Dep't, 679 F.2d 579, 584 & n. 3 (6th Cir.1982) (applicants \"should\nhave attempted to intervene when they first became aware of the action, rather than adopting a `wait-and-see'\napproach\"). Given that the settlement agreements specifically address training and the delivery of services in the\ncommunity, \"it would not have required unusual prescience on the part of the intervenors to recognize that their\ninterests were implicated\" when the decree was first proposed. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., 6 F.3d at 396. This\nfactor weighs against timely intervention by CMRA.\n4. Prejudice to the Parties\nCMRA claims that there is no prejudice to the parties because CMRA does not dispute any issues in the present\nsettlement agreements. The district judges concluded that allowing intervention at this late stage of the\nproceeding would add a complicated issue to the litigation. They held that the issues raised by CMRA went\nbeyond the scope of the suit's initial focus on the constitutional issue and statutory rights of developmentally\ndisabled residents of state facilities and would require considerable time and expense unnecessary in light of\nCMRA's access to other fora for resolution of its concern. While CMRA has agreed not to dispute the terms of the\nsettlement agreements, it has not made the same promise as to the remedial plans, the drafting of which involved\nthe participation of more than 2100 stakeholders over many months. There is a risk, to the extent CMRA seeks to\nintervene to discuss reimbursement rates, payment methodologies, or any other items on its list of grievances,\nthat prejudice against the other parties will occur; such attempts may force the parties into collateral litigation over\neconomic issues in cases that have already settled the merits of plaintiffs' claims. See Bradley v. Milliken, 828\nF.2d 1186, 1194 (6th Cir.1987). This factor also weighs against CMRA's intervention.\n5. Unusual Circumstances\nIn People First, CMRA admits that there are no unusual circumstances supporting intervention. In United States\nv. Tennessee CMRA contends there are unusual circumstances because of the pending appeals and active\n595 proceedings concerning compliance with the district court's orders. However, nothing in these *595 proceedings\nhas any effect on CMRA directly. The State of Tennessee, not the CMRA, is ultimately responsible for the funding\nof its mental health system to comply with the United States Constitution, federal statutes, and the courts' orders.\nCMRA has not shown that any of the factors that determine timeliness of intervention weigh in favor of allowing it\nto intervene this late in either lawsuit. Therefore, we are left with a \"definite and firm conviction that the courts ...\ndid not commit a clear error of judgment.\" Huey, 230 F.3d at 228.\nB. Whether CMRA has a substantial legal interest in the subject matter\nof the pending litigation, which may be impaired.\nCMRA claims that it has a substantial interest in this litigation because of its economic interest in how community\nservice programs are funded and because of the lock-in procedure established in the settlement agreements that\naffect how community-based services are provided. We have held, that:\n[I]n this circuit we subscribe to a \"rather expansive notion of the interest sufficient to invoke\nintervention of right.\" Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th Cir.1997). For\nexample, an intervenor need not have the same standing necessary to initiate a lawsuit. See id.; \nPurnell v. City of Akron, 925 F.2d 941, 948 (6th Cir.1991). We have also \"cited with approval\n\ndecisions of other courts `rejecting the notion that Rule 24(a)(2) requires a specific legal or\nequitable interest.'\" Miller, 103 F.3d at 1245 (quoting Purnell, 925 F.2d at 948). \"The inquiry into\nthe substantiality of the claimed interest is necessarily fact specific.\" Id.\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1999). We review the decisions of the district courts de novo to\ndetermine whether they properly held that CMRA did not establish a substantial interest in the litigation. See \nStupak-Thrall, 226 F.3d at 471.\nFirst, CMRA points to its economic interest in assuring adequate funding for implementation of the settlement\nagreements and its contractual rights in agreements with the State to provide community-based services. The\nparties to these lawsuits have entered into consent decrees aimed at guaranteeing that Tennessee provide at\nleast the minimum level of care to developmentally disabled individuals required by federal law. CMRA does not\nchallenge the terms of these agreements or contend that they fall below what federal law requires. CMRA is only\nconcerned with the level of funding provided by the State to community-based service providers. CMRA's\nclaimed interest does not concern the constitutional and statutory violations alleged in the litigation, but rather\nhow much its members get paid for providing services. CMRA has an interest in the economic component of the\nsettlement but the consent decrees obligate the State, not CMRA, to fund community services adequately. By the\nterms of the settlement agreements, it is the responsibility of the State of Tennessee to provide adequate and\nappropriate community services to members of the plaintiff class. Implementation of the settlement agreement\ndoes not alter CMRA's economic interests with the State to provide support and services to the class members\nnor its ability to negotiate the terms of these contracts. Further, as found by both district court judges, CMRA can\nprotect its economic interests in contract negotiations with the State by lobbying the legislative and executive\n596 branches for favorable funding *596 arrangements, and in state courts by suing to enforce its contractual rights.\nSecond, CMRA claims to have a sufficient interest in the litigation because of the lock-in provision in the Provider\nAgreement. The Provider Agreement provision at issue states:\nOnce a Contractor is serving a person on the supported living medical, supported living enhanced\nor supported living behavioral rates, the Contractor must continue to provide services and may not\ndischarge or deny services to that person without permission of the State pursuant to TCA\n33-1-202(c).\nProvider Agreement ¶ E.17. CMRA relies on this court's decision in Linton v. Commissioner of Health and\nEnvironment, 30 F.3d 55 (6th Cir.1994), where we held that intervention was appropriate because individual\nnursing homes had a substantial interest in a suit involving a State plan to remedy violations of the Medicaid Act.\nIn Linton, contracts between the State and nursing homes contained a lock-in provision that prohibited providers\nfrom opting out of the State's Medicaid system until the last patient voluntarily left the nursing home. Id. at\n1315-16. This provision effectively precluded the nursing homes from terminating their membership in Medicaid. \nId. at 1317. We reversed the district court in Linton and held that the effect of the lock-in violated the contractual\nand statutory rights of nursing homes and gave the nursing homes a substantial interest in the litigation to justify\nintervention. Id. at 1315-16, 1319.\nIn People First and the United States v. State of Tennessee, the district judges held that the lock-in provision in\ntheir cases did not have the same effect as in Linton and did not justify a substantial interest in this case to allow\nintervention. First, the agreements in these cases allow the service provider to petition the State to terminate or\nmodify services to the mentally retarded or those with mental disabilities, and thereby do not create a permanent\nobligation as is the case in Linton. Second, the lock-in provision in the cases before us does not establish an\nindefinite obligation on service providers to contract with the State as in Linton. Third, the community-based\nservice providers voluntarily entered into contracts with the State and remain free to renegotiate all aspects of its\ncontracts with the State of Tennessee.\nCMRA's economic interest and its interest in the lock-in provision do not reach the level of requisite substantial\ninterest required to intervene.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\nCMRA has not satisfied the requirements to intervene as of right because it was not timely in bringing its motions\nand did not establish an adequate substantial interest in either lawsuit. Because it has not established these\nnecessary elements, we do not analyze the claims of impairment of the applicant's ability to protect its interest in\nthe absence of intervention, and whether CMRA's interest is inadequately represented by the parties already\nbefore the court. See Michigan State AFL-CIO, 103 F.3d at 1245.\nThe judgments of the district courts are AFFIRMED.\n[*] The Honorable John Feikens, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] In People First, Judge Echols held that CMRA did not timely file its motion to intervene and, even if it had, the\norganization has no substantial interest in the litigation. In United States v. Tennessee, Judge McCalla held that\nCMRA lacked a substantial interest in the litigation, and in the alternative, held that the organization had not\ntimely filed its motion to intervene. For purposes of this appeal this distinction makes little difference.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The question of compliance arises in the context of a\ncontempt finding by the Court at a hearing on August 9, 1995, regarding five provisions of the Orders. Contempt\nOrder, docketed August 24, 1995. Since that finding, defendants have filed two motions for a determination of\npartial or complete compliance as to four provisions of the Orders.\nBecause the context in which the Orders and the contempt finding arose is important for determining whether or\nnot the defendants are now in compliance (i.e. have purged themselves of contempt), and because a discussion\nof the factual background of the contempt finding and a thorough discussion of the proof presented at a hearing\non October 10-11, 1995, may be beneficial to all the parties in framing their future responses and to the\ndefendants in conforming their conduct to achieve compliance, the matters before the Court will be discussed in\n\nsome detail. Factors of importance in resolving the issues before the Court include: (1) the degree of participation\nby the State of Tennessee in formulating the remedial provisions, and (2) the effort (or lack of effort)\n1296 demonstrated by the State of Tennessee in *1296 attempting to achieve the specific provisions of the Orders.\nSet out below are: (1) how the case and this issue arose, (2) the State of Tennessee's history of noncompliance,\n(3) the applicable law, (4) the positions of the parties, the evidence presented on October 10, 1995, and the\nCourt's findings regarding the effect of sanctions, and (5) the Court's findings regarding purgation of contempt,\ncompliance/noncompliance with the remedial provisions of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction, and\nappropriate future remedial sanctions.\nI.

ADC's population consists primarily of\nindividuals currently assessed as severely or profoundly retarded or developmentally disabled, some of whom\nhave associated physical handicaps, and mental or behavioral problems. ADC is an Intermediate Care Facility for\nthe Mentally Retarded (\"ICFMR\"). The federal government pays sixty-six per cent of the costs of operation of this\n[2]\nfacility, with the State of Tennessee paying the remaining thirty-four per cent.  Tr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995, at\n153-154.\nThe United States and the State of Tennessee have been in dispute regarding conditions at ADC since 1990. In\n1991, the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), as part of an investigation of possible statutory and\nconstitutional violations concerning the resident population at ADC, issued a findings letter citing deficiencies to\nthe State of Tennessee. The State of Tennessee refused to correct the deficiencies cited in the DOJ findings\nletter. On January 21, 1992, the United States filed this action against the State of Tennessee and Arlington\nDevelopmental Center, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§\n1997-1997j (1988).\nThe trial of this case took place over a two month period beginning on August 30, 1993. On November 22, 1993,\nthe Court issued an oral opinion and, on February 18, 1994, filed Supplemental Findings of Fact. For the\nadditional procedural and factual history of this case, see Contempt Order, docketed August 24, 1995, at 1-16. In\nthe oral opinion and Supplemental Findings, the Court held that conditions at ADC were in violation of the rights\nof its residents under the United States Constitution. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73\n[3]\nL.Ed.2d 28 (1982).\n1297 *1297 Concurrent with the oral ruling of November 22, 1993, the Court entered a preliminary injunction and\nestablished a schedule for submittal of a remedial plan by the State of Tennessee. As a result of that procedure,\nthe United States and the State of Tennessee negotiated a plan to remedy the unconstitutional conditions at\nADC. On September 2, 1994, the parties submitted a Stipulated Remedial Order to settle the case. As part of the\nsettlement, the United States and the State of Tennessee agreed to the appointment of a Monitor to assist and\noversee the State's compliance with the agreed-upon remedial plan. The Court, with the concurrence of both\n[4]\nparties, appointed Linda R. O'Neall, Ph.D., to perform that function.\nII. HISTORY OF NONCOMPLIANCE\nThe Remedial Plan negotiated by the State of Tennessee contains a \"schedule of implementation\" setting out the\n[5]\ntimeframes in which each of the remedial actions agreed to by the State was to be completed.  A large number\nof items were to be commenced within the first ninety days of implementation of the plan. Accordingly, the\nMonitor conducted the First Semi-Annual Compliance Review at ADC from November 28, 1994, through\nDecember 2, 1994. Based on this review, the Monitor issued a compliance report to the parties on March 9, 1995.\nThe report then went through a comment and response period and was ultimately the subject of a compliance\nhearing on April 10, 1995.\n\nAt the April 10, 1995, hearing, the Court determined that the State had achieved full compliance with only five of\nthe sixty-five self-imposed deadlines within the first ninety day period. In anticipation of this finding of\nnoncompliance, the State, after negotiation with the United States, proposed a \"Plan of Correction\" that was\nsubmitted to the Court as Exhibit 6 to the hearing of April 10, 1995. The introduction to the Plan of Correction\nsubmitted by the State of Tennessee provided as follows:\nThe Monitor's First Semi-Annual Compliance Review identified a number of areas in which the\ndefendants have failed to achieve full compliance with the provisions of the Remedial Order, in\nparticular, with respect to the areas of protection from harm, seizure management, and feeding/\nnutritional management. In order to appropriately prioritize and focus the corrective remedial\nmeasures to be taken by the defendants, the following Plan of Correction has been developed.\nPlan of Correction, Ex. 6, Hr'g, April 10, 1995.\nThe Plan of Correction supplements the Stipulated Remedial Order and, like the Remedial Plan, also contains a\nschedule for completion of specific actions. For example, under the individual case management section relating\nto seizure management, nurses were to be assigned individual resident case-loads by no later than April 20,\n1298 1995. Additionally, *1298 under paragraph II.C. of the Plan of Correction, the State of Tennessee was to have 136\nnursing positions \"on staff\" by July 1, 1995. Plan of Correction, Ex. 6, ¶ II.C., Hr'g, April 10, 1995. In that regard,\nthe State made the following commitment:\nDefendants will make ongoing efforts to fill these positions with Arlington nurse employees, rather\nthan contract nurses.\nId. (emphasis supplied). At the April 10, 1995, hearing, Linda Ross, an Assistant Attorney General for the State,\nasked Gaye A. Hansen, the State Facilitator of the Remedial Order at ADC, the following clarifying question\nregarding paragraph \"II.C.\":\nQ. Subparagraph C, nurse staffing, would you 00 what is the status of the 136 nursing positions?\n97\nA. Right. Well, although the plan of correction indicates that they will have approval on those\npositions by April the 14th, 1995, Arlington has, in fact, received approval on those provisions, got\nthat approval at the end of last week, so they can now immediately pursue the hiring of qualified\nnurses. That would be inclusive of LPNs and RNs in order to fill those slots. In the interim, they will\nfill them with agency nurses, contract nurses, but it is understood that contract nurses will not be\nassigned case loads of persons with seizure disorders; that they will use full-time nurses for that\npurpose.\nTr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995, at 68 (emphasis supplied).\nAdditionally, on April 10, 1995, the State represented to the plaintiff and to the Court that:\nWe do have at this time a verbal agreement with a developmental disability physician with a June\n1 start date.\nId. at 29 (Gaye A. Hansen, Facilitator of the Remedial Order at ADC). Ms. Hansen testified that \"I ... feel that this\nplan of correction has a great chance for success.\" Id. at 81. The new deadline for retention of a developmental\n[6]\nmedicine physician and the Plan of Correction  proposed by the State of Tennessee were accepted by the\nCourt.\nHowever, the record supports the conclusion that, between April 10, 1995, and June 30, 1995, the State\nabandoned its goal of achieving compliance with its own Stipulated Remedial Order and its own Plan of\n[7]\nCorrection. The State effectively ceased its efforts to obtain a developmental physician and recruit nurses,  the\nnumber of primary care physicians (including Medical Director) decreased to two (well below the minimum\nrequirement and the number previously anticipated by the State), and conditions at ADC deteriorated even\nfurther. Tr., Hr'g, June 30, 1995, at 7-22; Contempt Order, docketed August 24, 1995, at 6-7.\n\nSeveral patient deaths and the second compliance inspection by the Monitor and her Developmental Medicine\nExpert on June 27-30, 1995, led the United States and the Monitor to request an Emergency Order on June 30,\n1995. The United States and the Monitor requested that the order require the State to rectify certain fundamental\nservices which it had allowed to deteriorate between April 10, 1995, and June 30, 1995, and require the State to\n1299 employ within the near *1299 future certain professional staff, mandated by the Remedial Order and the Plan of\nCorrection. The State acknowledged that the facts constituting an emergency existed, and agreed to the\n[8]\nEmergency Order requirements.  Tr., Hr'g, June 30, 1995, at 3, 15-16, 30. During the June 30, 1995, telephone\nhearing, the State of Tennessee declared that it \"had no quarrel with the wisdom of what was being suggested,\"\nsince in \"virtually all instances ... [the State has] begun to take steps to put those measures in place.\" Id. at 15.\nA hearing to determine whether the emergency continued to exist and whether the State was in compliance with\nthe Emergency Order resulting from the June 30, 1995, telephone conference was scheduled for July 10, 1995.\nAt that hearing it was established that the State was not in compliance with the Emergency Order. Moreover, in\ncontrast to Ms. Hansen's April 10, 1995, testimony regarding a \"great chance of success,\" Tr., Hr'g, April 10,\n1995, at 81, Commissioner Cardwell offered the following testimony regarding her July 5, 1995, conversation with\nGovernor Sundquist:\nQ. And could you inform the Court what the context 00 what was discussed in that in terms of what\n97\nis going to be done about Arlington, what the governor's position is and what actions are going to\nbe taken?\nA. The governor is very anxious to know whether or not Arlington can be fixed and the governor\nwould like to know what our plans are for the future.\nQ. What in response to those two questions did you answer to the governor?\nA. I told him I was not sure of the first one, as to whether or not Arlington could be fixed.\nTr., Hr'g, July 10, 1995, at 101 (Commissioner Cardwell) (emphasis supplied).\nAt the end of the July 10, 1995, hearing, additional time to achieve compliance with the Emergency Order and\nPreliminary Injunction provisions was granted, and a compliance hearing was scheduled for August 9, 1995. At\n1300 the hearing on August 9, 1995,[9]*1300 clear and convincing proof was presented by the United States that the\nState of Tennessee still was not in compliance with five of the provisions of the Emergency Order and Preliminary\nInjunction. The United States insisted, in closing argument, that the State of Tennessee be found in contempt\nbased on its failure to comply with remedial provisions to which it had agreed. The United States left the\nsanctions to be imposed to the discretion of the Court.\nBased on the evidence presented on August 9, 1995, it was uncontrovertible that the State was not in compliance\nand had failed to perform as it had agreed. Moreover, the State admitted that it did not even have a current plan\nto implement the various remedial provisions to which it had agreed. Tr., Hr'g, August 9, 1995, at 46 11. 15-19\n(Commissioner Cardwell). The Court, therefore, found the State in contempt and ordered minimal coercive and\nremedial sanctions to assure that the State would accomplish the five emergency provisions which were agreed\nto on June 30, 1995, but which had not been achieved by the State. Contempt Order, docketed August 24, 1995.\n[10]\nThe financial sanction imposed was, to some degree, symbolic  (one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per\nviolation) since the ADC budget is relatively large and sixty-six (66) percent of that budget is federally funded. Tr.,\nHr'g, April 10, 1995, at 190 11. 2-4 (Durbin); Tr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995, at 154 11. 3-5 (Martins); see note 2 supra.\nTo directly address emergency matters, a coercive sanction, therefore, was imposed on the Tennessee\nCommissioner of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Specifically, the Commissioner was required to spend\nevery fourth weekend at ADC until the State was in full compliance with the five emergency remedial provisions\nto which it had agreed on June 30, 1995, but which, as of August 9, 1995, it had not done.\nOn August 9, 1995, the Court found the State had failed to comply with the following five paragraphs: paragraph\n1 (retention of a developmental physician), paragraph 2 (performance of duties of a developmental physician),\nparagraph 5 (retention of a full-time psychiatrist), paragraph 7 (entry by Arlington Developmental Center into\n\ncontracts with two developmental nurse consultants), and paragraph 8 (hiring of 136 nurses as set out in the April\n[11]\n10, 1995, Plan of Correction).\nIII. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. CIVIL CONTEMPT\nFederal courts have inherent powers to assure the administration of justice. See United States v. Hudson, 11\nU.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812). The most prominent among these inherent powers is the contempt\nsanction, \"which a judge must have and exercise in protecting the authority and dignity of the court....\" Roadway\nExpress v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2463, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (quoting Cooke v. United\n1301 States, 267 U.S. 517, 539, 45 *1301 S.Ct. 390, 395-96, 69 L.Ed. 767 (1925)). \"[T]he power of courts to punish for\ncontempts is a necessary and integral part of the independence of the judiciary, and is absolutely essential to the\nperformance of the duties imposed on them by law.\" Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 450,\n31 S.Ct. 492, 501, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911); see also 18 U.S.C. § 401 (1988) (\"A court of the United States shall have\nthe power to punish, by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority ... [as]\n[12]\n[d]isobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command\").  Civil contempt is\n[13]\nthe power of the court to impose sanctions to coerce compliance with its orders. Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S.\n624, 632, 108 S.Ct. 1423, 1429-30, 99 L.Ed.2d 721 (1988); Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370, 86\nS.Ct. 1531, 1535, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966); Gompers, 221 U.S. at 442, 31 S.Ct. at 498. Both imprisonment and\nfines, when coercive or conditional, are legitimate civil contempt sanctions. See, e.g., Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 370,\n86 S.Ct. at 1535 (imprisonment); United States v. Bayshore Assoc., Inc., 934 F.2d 1391, 1400 (6th Cir. 1991)\n(fines).\nB. PURGING CONTEMPT\n1. What Is It and What Is Its Purpose?\nOnce subject to contempt for failure to comply with a court order, the contemnor must be afforded an opportunity\nto purge itself of the contempt. International Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, ___ U.S. ___, ___,\n114 S.Ct. 2552, 2558, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994); Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 371, 86 S.Ct. at 1536. Compliance with that\n[14]\ncourt order will purge the contempt and free the contemnor from coercive sanctions. See Bayshore Assoc.,\n934 F.2d 1391, 1400 (6th Cir.1991) (\"[O]nce the defendant performs the act required by the court, he must be\nreleased\"). The determination of compliance, like all decisions relating to contempt, is at the discretion of the\ncourt. See Peppers v. Barry, 873 F.2d 967, 968 (6th Cir.1989); National Labor Relat. Bd. v. Aquabrom, Division of\nGreat Lakes Chemical Corp., 855 F.2d 1174, 1187 (6th Cir.1988) (\"The only limitation [on a court's contempt\npower] is that in a civil proceeding, the sanctions must not be penal in nature, but must be coercive or remedial\").\nIn making its determinations on compliance and the appropriateness of continued contempt sanctions, a court\nshould be guided by the remedial purpose of contempt. See Aquabrom, 855 F.2d 1174, 1187 (6th Cir.1988)\n(\"[The court's power to coerce actions to purge contempt is] the power of a court to grant the relief that is\nnecessary to effect compliance with its decree. The measure of the [c]ourt's power in civil contempt proceedings\n1302 is determined by the requirements of full remedial relief\") (citing *1302McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336\nU.S. 187, 193, 69 S.Ct. 497, 500-01, 93 L.Ed. 599 (1949)).\n2. Standard for Judging Compliance\nThe Sixth Circuit test for judging compliance is whether the contemnors \"took all reasonable steps within their\npower to comply with the court's order.\" Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703, 708 (6th Cir.1991) (quoting Peppers,\n873 F.2d at 969). Precisely what \"all reasonable steps within [the contemnor's] power\" are varies from case to\ncase according to the requirements of the order and the particular circumstances of the case. In every case,\n\nhowever, a contemnor must have the ability to comply with the order before failure to comply can form the basis\n[15]\nof contempt. McNeil v. Director, Patuxent Institution, 407 U.S. 245, 251, 92 S.Ct. 2083, 2087-88, 32 L.Ed.2d\n719 (1972); Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 72, 68 S.Ct. 401, 409, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948). Other than a showing of\nthe impossibility of compliance, nothing short of substantial compliance, as measured under the Peppers test, will\nsuffice to purge contempt for noncompliance with a court order. The Sixth Circuit has explicitly rejected the\ncontention that a good faith effort is sufficient, Peppers, 873 F.2d at 968,TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 722 F.2d\n1261, 1273 (6th Cir.1983), and has not adopted the less demanding diligent efforts test favored in other circuits.\n[16]\nCourts have been particularly unsympathetic to purported excuses for less-than-substantial compliance where\nthe contemnor has participated in drafting the order against which compliance is measured. See, e.g., Glover,\n934 F.2d at 708-09 (finding state prison officials in contempt for failing to abide by order consisting of negotiated\nsettlement between the parties); see also Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276, 110 S.Ct. 625, 632-33,\n107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990) (upholding finding of contempt against city that had failed to take action required by\nconsent decree). A party participating in drafting an order does so with an understanding of what it reasonably\ncan accomplish. When that party subsequently fails to live up to the particulars of the order, it is more difficult for\na court to excuse that failure than if the order had been court imposed.\nC. CONTEMPT SANCTIONS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH A COURT\nORDER\n1. Options Available to the Court\nOnce a contemnor has been found in noncompliance, such that contempt is not purged, the court has the option\nof continuing the sanctions already in place or imposing new sanctions determined to be more effective in\ncarrying out the underlying remedial purpose. This choice, like all decisions relating to contempt sanctions, is at\nthe court's discretion. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1275-76,\n1303 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). *1303 The range of sanctions available to courts include fine, imprisonment, receivership,\nand a broader category of creative, non-traditional sanctions. See 42 U.S.C. § 401 (1988) (authorizing \"fine or\nimprisonment\"); Hicks, 485 U.S. at 632, 108 S.Ct. at 1429-30 (fines and imprisonment); Shillitani, 384 U.S. at\n370-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1535-36 (imprisonment); Gompers, 221 U.S. at 441, 31 S.Ct. at 498 (fines and\nimprisonment); Reed v. Rhodes, 642 F.2d 186 (6th Cir.1981) (receivership and appointment of judicial\nadministrator); Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703, 707-15 (appointment of a special administrator, which was not\namong the \"traditional civil contempt sanctions\"). The choice of a sanction also necessitates a decision on how\nsevere that particular sanction should be.\n2. Determining Contempt Sanctions 00 Selection and Severity\n97\nThere are two guiding principles for the selection of civil contempt sanctions. First, the sanction must be coercive\nor remedial rather than punitive. National Labor Relat. Bd. v. Aquabrom, Division of Great Lakes Chem. Corp.,\n855 F.2d 1174, 1187 (6th Cir.1988). The contemnor is not simply being punished for past behavior, but rather\nencouraged to shape its behavior to comply with the order based on the undesirability of suffering the sanction.\nThe goal of sanctions, then, is to coerce the contemnor to act in such a way that the remedial purposes of the\norder are furthered. When using civil contempt in such a way, the court \"must then consider the character and\nmagnitude of the harm threatened by the continued contumacy, and the probable effectiveness of any suggested\nsanction in bringing about the result desired.\" United States v. United Mine Workers of Am., 330 U.S. 258, 304,\n67 S.Ct. 677, 701, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). Second, particularly when imposing sanctions against state officials, the\ncourt should select the least intrusive sanction that the court determines will coerce the contemnor to comply. \nSpallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276, 110 S.Ct. 625, 632-33, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990); Kendrick v. Bland,\n740 F.2d 432 (6th Cir.1984). In any given case, there may be many sanctions that will coerce compliance and\nfurther the remedial purpose of the order, but a court does not automatically impose the most severe and\n\nintrusive. There are two competing concerns in this determination: intrusiveness and effectiveness. Determining\nthe relative intrusiveness of different possible sanctions in a particular case is a common sense inquiry. See, e.g.,\nHutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2573-74, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978) (noting that a fine is a less\nintrusive sanction than imprisonment); Glover v. Johnson, 855 F.2d 277, 287 (6th Cir.1988) (suggesting that,\nwhile the court's appointment of a judicial administrator in the instant case was too intrusive, using a court\nmonitor to enforce its orders would be permissible); Reed v. Rhodes, 642 F.2d 186 (6th Cir.1981) (approving the\nappointment of an administrator to oversee compliance with court order but disapproving receivership as too\nintrusive in the instant case). Determining what sanctions will be effective to coerce compliance involves a court's\ndiscretion and judgment based on an understanding of the case and the contemnor, particularly with respect to\nthe nature of prior noncompliance.\nGiven that contempt sanctions are within a court's discretion and that there is no simple formula for assigning a\nparticular sanction to a given case, a court clearly can consider a contemnor's history of compliance or\nnoncompliance in shaping an appropriate contempt sanction. Compare Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703, 715\n(6th Cir.1991) (noting that a \"persistent pattern of obfuscation, hyper-technical objections, delay, and litigation by\nexhaustion on the part of the defendants to avoid compliance with the letter and spirit of the district court's\norders\" made the sanction of appointing an administrator justified where it had been found too intrusive three\nyears earlier) with Glover v. Johnson, 855 F.2d 277, 287 (6th Cir.1988). While there is no intent requirement for\ncivil contempt, the issue of the contemnor's willfulness in not complying with court orders may be taken into\nconsideration in determining the extent of the contempt sanction. TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 722 F.2d 1261,\n1273 (6th Cir.1983); Rogers v. Webster, 776 F.2d 607, 612 (6th Cir.1985). The contemnor's relative intent clearly\n1304 is relevant in *1304 gauging how severe a sanction is necessary in a given case. See United States v. United\nMine Workers of Am., 330 U.S. 258, 304, 67 S.Ct. 677, 701, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947) (\"[The court] must then consider\nthe character and magnitude of the harm threatened by continued contumacy, and the probable effectiveness of\nany suggested sanction in bringing about the result desired\"); see also United States v. Work Wear Corp., 602\nF.2d 110, 116 (6th Cir.1979) (upholding the district court's denial of a motion to reduce a civil contempt fine 00\n97\ndespite the government's recommendation for reduction 00 where the contemnor had made a \"conscious\n97\nbusiness decision\" not to comply, even though the district court had granted an extension to give the contemnor\ntime to come into compliance). When a contemnor's noncompliance has been based in part on conscious\ndecisions to take less than \"all reasonable steps within their power to comply,\" a court clearly would be entitled to\ntake such into consideration in shaping contempt sanctions.\nIV. THE OCTOBER 10-11, 1995, HEARING\nA. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\nOn October 10-11, 1995, the Court held a hearing on defendants' compliance with the remedial provisions of the\nJune 30, 1995, Emergency Order and July 10, 1995, Preliminary Injunction. See Appendices 4, 5. Prior to the\ncommencement of the hearing, defendants filed two motions for findings of partial compliance. Defendants'\nMotion for Finding of Partial Compliance, docketed August 18, 1995; Defendants' Second Motion for Finding of\nPartial Compliance, docketed August 25, 1995. In their initial motion for finding of partial compliance, defendants\nasserted that they were now in compliance with paragraphs 5 and 8. Specifically, defendants asserted that they\nhad retained a full-time psychiatrist as of August 14, 1995, and were, as of that date, in full compliance with\nparagraph 5. See Compliance Table, Appendix 7. Regarding compliance with paragraph 8, the defendants, in\ntheir first motion, asserted that as of August 11, 1995, 136 nurses were on the ADC payroll and that, therefore,\nthey were in compliance with that provision.\nIn their second motion for a finding of partial compliance, defendants asserted that they were in compliance with\nparagraphs 1 and 7 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction and that compliance was achieved on\nJuly 21, 1995. Specifically, defendants asserted that effective July 21, 1995, they had retained the services of Dr.\nRicardo Causo, a Developmental Medicine Physician, and that effective August 23, 1995, ADC had executed\nconsulting contracts with two developmental nurses as required under paragraph 7. Defendants concede that\nthey have not complied with paragraph 2 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction. See Appendices 4,\n\n5 (¶ 2, Duties of Developmental Physician); see Compliance Table, Appendix 7. Defendants asserted that they\nwere in compliance with all other provisions of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction.\nAt the outset of the October 10-11, 1995, hearing, the United States agreed that the defendants were in\ncompliance with paragraphs 5 (full-time psychiatrist) and 7 (two developmental nurse consultant contracts). The\nUnited States took the position that defendants were not in compliance with paragraphs 1 (Developmental\nMedicine Physician) and 2 (Duties of Developmental Medicine Physician) and that there were questions\nregarding the date or fact of compliance with paragraph 8 (136 nurses). The United States also urged that the\ndefendants had not purged themselves of contempt and, because of the defendants' history of failing to perform\nabsent imposition of sanctions, the remedial and coercive sanctions imposed in the August 9, 1995, Contempt\nOrder remained necessary in order to compel compliance. Tr., Hr'g, October 11, 1995, at 238-241.\nThe intervenor class representative, People First, agreed with the United States that the defendants were not in\ncompliance with paragraphs 1, 2, and 8, and that the defendants were in compliance with paragraphs 5 and 7.\nRegarding paragraph 8, the intervenor People First argued that the plain language of the April 10, 1995, Plan of\n1305 Correction, as adopted in the June 30, 1995, Emergency Order and the July 10, 1995, *1305 Preliminary\nInjunction required that the defendants \"hire to the capacity of 136 nurses as called for by the Plan of\nCorrection....\" Emergency Order, June 30, 1995, ¶ 6. Intervenor People First argued that the language is\nunambiguous and does not provide for the use of agency or contract nurses. Intervenor People First urged the\nCourt to establish a nurse turnover goal (to reduce turnover to five percent) and a constant caseload requirement,\npursuant to paragraph 12 of the Preliminary Injunction. Tr., Hr'g, October 11, 1995, at 242-243.\nThe intervenor Parent-Guardian Association took no position regarding compliance and urged that any sanction\nimposed be crafted so as not to adversely affect employee morale at ADC. Tr., Hr'g, October 11, 1995, at\n244-246.\nB. EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON OCTOBER 10, 1995\n[17]\nThe State of Tennessee called seven witnesses  and introduced twenty-eight exhibits at the October 10, 1995,\nhearing. The United States called only one witness, Commissioner Cardwell. A discussion of the testimony and\nexhibits follows.\n1. Grunow\nBarbara Grunow, Director of Human Resources Development for the Tennessee Department of Mental Health\nand Mental Retardation, testified that she is responsible for \"overall assistance to our ten facilities with\nrecruitment for our professional staff persons, and most of all our ... health care professionals.\" Tr., Hr'g, October\n10, 1995, at 12. Ms. Grunow has \"responsibility for identifying issues that are relevant to retention of those\nindividuals [i.e., health care professionals].\" Id.\nMs. Grunow became actively involved with recruitment activities at ADC in July 1995. Id. at 23. Since that time,\nshe has been involved in the recruitment of developmental physicians, physical therapists, and nurses. Id. at\n12-27. Her specific activities have included the placement of advertisements in six physician's journals for the\nposition of developmental physician (advertisements were to run in September and October 1995), recruiting for\na developmental physician at the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine\n(September 28-30, 1995), and contacting medical school developmental medicine departments. Additionally,\nduring the first week of October 1995, she prepared an analysis of benefits available to developmental physicians\n[18]\nthrough employment with either the State of Tennessee or the University of Tennessee (\"UT\"). Id. at 24-25.\nGrunow's duties since July 1995 have included \"assistance in receiving or obtaining confirmation on the licensure\nof [physicians] to practice in Tennessee.\" Id. at 18. Ms. Grunow testified that, of the three developmental\nphysicians under contract from Columbus Medical Services to provide developmental medicine services at ADC,\nonly two physicians (Dr. Compart and Dr. Rogers) have now completed licensure. The third, Dr. Hayes, is not\n\nlicensed in Tennessee and has not provided the information necessary in order to complete the licensure\napplication. Id. at 20.\nMs. Grunow testified that, in connection with the recruitment of two developmental nurses, she placed classified\n[19]\nadvertisements in five Tennessee newspapers on August 17, 1995.\n1306 2. Womack\n*1306\nPatricia Louise Womack, an administrative services assistant with the Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation, testified that she was responsible for assisting ADC with the recruitment of nurses (licensed practical\nnurses (\"LPNs\"), registered nurses (\"RNs\"), and developmental disability nurses). Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at\n29. Since July 5, 1995, Ms. Womack has been stationed at ADC. Ms. Womack has been involved in many of the\nsame activities as Ms. Grunow. Ms. Womack reported that, as of October 9, 1995, ADC had hired one\ndevelopmental disabilities nurse, Mariah Kurlick. Id. at 32; Ex. 3, Hr'g, October 10, 1995.\nMs. Womack also testified regarding the number of nurses to be employed at ADC pursuant to the Plan of\nCorrection as follows:\nQ. Are your familiar with the nursing number requirements established at Arlington Developmental\nCenter?\nA. Yes, ma'am.\nQ. And what are those nursing number requirements?\nA. There is a requirement for 136 nurses to be employed at Arlington, comprised of RNs, LPNs,\nand staff nurses.\nTr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 32.\nMs. Womack testified regarding three categories of nurses utilized at ADC: state employees, contract employees,\n[20]\nand agency nurses.  Until August 11, 1995, the State of Tennessee regarded Med Temps nurses as agency\n[21]\nnurses. Id. at 35. On September 15, 1995, ADC unilaterally changed the characterization of Med Temps\n[22]\nnurses from agency nurses to \"contract nurses.\" Id. at 35. While Ms. Womack testified that the State was in\ncompliance with the number of nurses required by the Plan of Correction, she acknowledged that it was her\n1307 \"assumption\" that all three categories of nurses (employee, contract, and agency) could be counted for *1307 the\npurposes of determining compliance. Id. at 50 1. 7. Significantly, Ms. Womack was not present at ADC until well\nafter the State's submission of the Plan of Correction and the entry of the Emergency Order. Id. at 35.\nExhibit 4, an ADC Nursing Status Report generated by the State, was introduced through Ms. Womack. Id. at 37; \nsee Appendix 2 (Summary pages from Exhibit 4 for the period August 11, 1995, to October 4, 1995). Exhibit 4\nreflects that 136 nursing positions were allocated for ADC and ninety-two of those positions had been filled as of\nAugust 10, 1995. Additionally, seventeen contract nurses and twenty-seven agency nurses were providing\nservices at ADC, bringing the total nursing staff to 136. Ms. Womack confirmed that as of October 10, 1995, the\nState had not analyzed the turnover among contract and agency nurse positions at ADC. Additionally, Ms.\nWomack confirmed that ADC had not filled the position of quality assurance nurse. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at\n52. Ms. Womack also testified that, as of October 10, 1995, there were 102 state employee nurses, thirty-three\n[23]\ncontract nurses (including Med Temps nurses),  and sixteen agency nurses at ADC. Id. at 41.\n3. Durbin\nLarry Durbin, the Assistant Commissioner for Mental Retardation Services for the State of Tennessee, testified\nthat he has overall operating responsibilities for all the State's mental retardation and developmental disabilities\nservices. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 54. Dr. Durbin is primarily responsible for the State's efforts to retain a\n\nDevelopmental Medicine Physician. Id. at 54-55. In that regard, Dr. Durbin testified that immediately after entry of\nthe Emergency Order he contacted Columbus Medical Services and \"began negotiations to have them involved\nin a nationwide search for a qualified developmental disability physician.\" Id. at 55. He also contacted the\nUniversity of Tennessee and sought to expedite their efforts to hire a recruiting firm in Atlanta, Georgia (Ward\nHowell). Id. On July 12, 1995, the State of Tennessee and Columbus Medical Services entered into a contract for\n[24]\nprofessional search and consulting services.\nDr. Durbin testified regarding the current status of recruitment efforts for a Developmental Medicine Physician, as\nwell as the current status of the agreement with Columbus Medical Services for interim developmental medicine\nphysician services. Id. at 56-58, 60-61. Originally, the State of Tennessee did not require in its contract with\nColumbus Medical Services that the Developmental Medicine Physicians supplied by Columbus be licensed to\npractice in the State of Tennessee. Because unlicensed physicians could not provide actual clinical treatment or\npractice medicine in the State of Tennessee, it was necessary for the State of Tennessee to seek an amendment\nof its contract with Columbus Medical Services so that the State could obtain physicians who could provide actual\ntreatment to residents of ADC. See Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 60-61. On October 5, 1995, almost three\nmonths after the execution of the original contract, the State and Columbus Medical Services agreed to such an\n[25]\namendment.  The amendment reads, in part, as follows:\n1308 *1308 A. Services to be provided at Arlington Developmental Center\n1. Columbus Medical Services agrees to provide only DD physician consultants who are fully\nlicensed to practice medicine in the State of Tennessee.\nEx. 7, Hr'g, October 10, 1995.\n4. Akers\nPhillip V. Akers, Medical Director at ADC, testified regarding the developmental medical services provided by\nColumbus Medical Services. Dr. Akers confirmed that on March 14, 1995, he had conducted an analysis\nregarding the nursing needs of ADC. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 108. At that time, Dr. Akers concluded that\nADC's nursing needs are closer to those of an acute care facility and recommended to Dr. Durbin a full nurse\ncompliment of 136, including nurse administrators. Id. at 108-109; Ex. 23, Hr'g, October 10, 1995. Dr. Akers'\nrecommendation of 136 nurses was conveyed to Dr. Durbin in a March 14, 1995, memorandum. Id.; Appendix 3.\nDr. Akers also testified regarding: (1) the contracting process for emergency services; Id. at 105-106; Ex. 22,\nHr'g, October 10, 1995; (2) the hospital agreements negotiated on behalf of ADC; Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at\n100; Ex. 19, Hr'g, October 10, 1995; and (3) the current prohibition against use of \"Do Not Resuscitate\" orders at\nstate facilities. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 99-100. Dr. Akers testified that Dr. Kelly Askins, a full-time\npsychiatrist, had been hired and a training program established for him. Id. at 85-87. Furthermore, Dr. Akers\nconfirmed that ADC now has four primary care physicians other than himself. Dr. Akers also described their\n[26]\norientation and training since July 1995. Id. at 88-91; Ex. 15, Hr'g, October 10, 1995.\nDr. Akers discussed the implementation of a \"physician alert\" form to assure communication between those\nphysicians providing evening and early morning coverage and each resident's primary care physician. Tr., Hr'g,\nOctober 10, 1995, at 81-84; Ex. 13, Hr'g, October 10, 1995. Dr. Akers also described, in general, the increased\nefforts at education, disease tracking, communications, and recruitment at ADC primarily since the imposition of\nsanctions on August 9, 1995. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 78-81; see Ex. 12 (Draft, ADC Nursing Guidelines/\nTracking Critical Illness, August 31, 1995), Ex. 14 (Lecture and Discussion Topics for the Period September\n11-22, 1995), Ex. 16 (Physician/Staff In Service October 6, 1995), Ex. 17 (Physician/FNP Staff In Service\nOctober 9, 1995), Ex. 20 (Patient Transfer Packet/September 1995), Ex. 22 (Request to Hospitals for Discharge\n[27]\nSummaries/September 13-29 1995), Hr'g, October 10, 1995.\nDr. Akers discussed the role of Dr. Causo, a special contract developmental pediatrician who has been retained\nby ADC for ninety days while the State recruited a Developmental Medicine Physician with the necessary training\nand experience. Because Dr. Causo lacked certain training, Dr. Akers indicated that \"I changed the role he was\n\nplaying 00 we had identified at that point a list of persons proposed for transition from Arlington to the community\n97\nwith projected dates where they might be ready to move.\" Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 70. Dr. Akers, after\ndiscussions with the UT consultants (Dr. Kube and Dr. Palmer) determined that Dr. Causo would be most useful\nin evaluating the group of residents that was scheduled for transition to the community.\n1309 *1309 Dr. Akers acknowledged that this role was different from the initial interim developmental medicine role\nenvisioned for Dr. Causo. Id. at 69-72. The role initially contemplated for Dr. Causo, therefore, has been partially\nassumed by Drs. Palmer and Kube of the University of Tennessee and the two Columbus Medical Services\n[28]\ndevelopmental physicians who are licensed to practice in Tennessee. Id. at 64-65, 71-73. Dr. Akers\nacknowledged, however, that the developmental physicians from Columbus Medical Services had not been able\n[29]\nto attend team meetings because of scheduling problems. Id. at 73-74.\nDr. Akers also testified that he met with Commissioner Cardwell on August 12, 1995, during her first remedial visit\nto ADC. According to Dr. Akers, during that visit, Commissioner Cardwell reviewed the deficiencies previously\ncited by the Monitor's Developmental Medicine Expert, Dr. Wachtel, in an effort to determine whether the\n[30]\nasserted deficiencies in fact existed.  Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 128-129. During his visit with\nCommissioner Cardwell on the weekend of August 12, 1995, Dr. Akers accompanied the Commissioner on a\nreview of ADC, \"[going] cottage to cottage and record to record....\" Id. at 130. No reports or documents were\ngenerated by Dr. Akers as a result of either the August 11-14, 1995, or the September 8-11, 1995, visit of\nCommissioner Cardwell. Id. at 131.\n5. Palmer\nDr. Frederick Palmer, a developmental pediatrician, the Director of the Bolling Center for Developmental\nDisabilities (University of Tennessee) and a UT professor of pediatrics, testified regarding his efforts to recruit a\ndevelopmental physician for the position at ADC. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 143. Dr. Palmer described those\nefforts as beginning in late July 1995. Id. at 143-144. Within the last two years Dr. Palmer has recruited two\ndevelopmental physicians 00 Dr. Kube and Dr. Peterson 00 for the developmental medicine program at UT. Id. at\n97 97\n146. Dr. Palmer assisted in Dr. Causo's orientation, and provides continuing supervision for Dr. Causo at ADC. Id.\nat 147.\n6. Askins\nDr. Kelly Marsh Askins, a board eligible psychiatrist and an employee of ADC as of August 14, 1995, also\ntestified. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 157-158. He confirmed his date of employment and the orientation and\ntraining that he has received since arriving at ADC. Dr. Askins will be attending a series of conferences and,\n[31]\nperhaps, a mini-fellowship over the next several months.\n7. Lester\nNorma J. Lester, the Director of Nursing at ADC since September 15, 1995, also testified. Ms. Lester has worked\nfor thirty-two years primarily in institutional nursing. She testified that, as Director of Nursing at ADC, she is\n\"primarily responsible for coordinating resources and training for the nursing staff.\" Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at\n1310 175. Ms. *1310 Lester identified the two developmental nurse consultant contracts that have now been entered\ninto by ADC. Id. at 182; Ex. 28, Hr'g, October 10, 1995. Ms. Lester stated that the addition of the developmental\nnurse consultants has been helpful. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 182-183.\nBased on her review of nurse training records, Ms. Lester stated that approximately eight agency nurses have\nnot received seizure training and approximately fourteen State employee nurses have not received seizure\ntraining. Id. at 185. Ms. Lester also confirmed that she did not prepare the ADC nursing status reports contained\nin Exhibit 4. See Appendix 2. Regarding turnover, Ms. Lester testified as follows:\n\nNow, in regards to the turnover, we do tend to see a fair amount of turnover. In fact, it is like today,\nwe can't keep up with it, and I think that's for many reasons ... I have only been there for just three\nweeks and I have already had to terminate and reassign just in that short period of time, so 00 and\n97\nthis is an ongoing process with us.\nId. at 189-190. Ms. Lester went on to indicate that \"there is always going to be a degree of turnover, but I would\nlike to keep that down to a minimum, perhaps 5%, if that is realistic....\" Id. at 190-191.\n8. Cardwell\nMarjorie Nelle Cardwell, the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, was the\nlast witness to testify at the October 10, 1995, hearing. Commissioner Cardwell testified regarding her activities\nboth on the weekends of August 11, 1995, and September 8, 1995. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 194-203.\nCommissioner Cardwell observed that on Saturday, August 12, 1995, \"the only administrative staff that I saw [at\nADC] was Dr. Akers. ...\" Id. at 201. On Sunday, August 13, 1995, she met with Dr. Akers, Gaye Hansen, and Dr.\nDurbin at ADC.\nCommissioner Cardwell indicated that on her second stay she \"did pretty much the same thing again, just\ntouching base with all units on campus. It is important, always has been important to me, particularly for those\nsecond and third shift people to know that there is a supervisor around.\" Id. at 202. On her second weekend,\nCommissioner Cardwell did not meet with Dr. Durbin or other administrators \"because they were not available.\" \nId. at 206. Regarding administrative staff working on the weekend, Commissioner Cardwell observed:\nI did not ask other people to give up their weekends when they had been working steady five days\na week already recruiting. I did not think it would add anything by contacting people on Saturdays\nand Sundays.\nId. at 211.\nRegarding whether the State has an overall plan for implementation of the remedy at ADC, Commissioner\nCardwell stated that \"not all of the timelines have the implementation to it ... those are the parts that are not down\n[32] [33]\nin black and white at this point.\" ,  Id. at 214.\n[34]\nC. FINDINGS REGARDING EFFECT OF SANCTIONS\n1. The sanctions imposed in the August 9, 1995, Contempt Order have been effective in compelling actions by\nthe defendants in furtherance of the remedial purpose of not only the Emergency Order and Preliminary\n1311 Injunction but also of the September 2, 1994, *1311 Stipulated Remedial Order and the April 10, 1995, Plan of\nCorrection. This is particularly evidenced by the testimony of Dr. Akers and Exhibit 9 (Developmental disability\n[35]\nconsultations as of October 9, 1995), Exhibit 11 (ADC master at-risk list/current as of October 3, 1995),\nExhibit 12 (Draft, ADC Nursing Guideline/Tracking Critical Illness, August 31, 1995), Exhibit 14 (Lecture and\nDiscussion Topics for the Period September 11-22, 1994), Exhibit 16 (Physician/Staff in Service October 6,\n1995), Exhibit 17 (Physician/FNP Staff in Service, October 9, 1995), Exhibit 20 (Patient Transfer Packet/\nSeptember 1995), and Exhibit 21 (Request for Discharge Summaries, September 13 and 29, 1995).\n2. The sanctions imposed have increased recruiting efforts for a developmental physician (testimony of Durbin,\nAkers, and Grunow) and for developmental nurses (testimony of Grunow and Womack), and have contributed to\nthe retention of a Director of Nursing (testimony of Cardwell), a full-time psychiatrist (Dr. Askins), two\ndevelopmental nurse consultants, and one developmental nurse (Ex. 28, Hr'g, October 10, 1995). See\nCompliance Chart, Appendix 7.\n3. Sanctions have resulted in the completion of a relatively high percentage of the remedial provisions of the\nEmergency and Preliminary Injunction when compared with the compliance percentage for the Stipulated\n\nRemedial Order as evidenced by the First Semi-Annual Compliance Review. See Tr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995\n(compliance with only five of sixty-five requirements of Stipulated Remedial Order); See also Compliance Chart,\nAppendix 7; Tr., Hr'g, October 27, 1995.\nV.\nA. FINDINGS REGARDING PURGATION OF CONTEMPT AND\nCOMPLIANCE/NONCOMPLIANCE WITH REMEDIAL\nThere is no dispute that the defendants have now fully complied with two of the five provisions which were the\nsubject of the Contempt Order of August 24, 1995. As of August 14, 1995, Dr. Askins was employed as a full-time\npsychiatrist at ADC; thus, paragraph 5 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction has been satisfied. \nSee Compliance Chart, Appendix 7. Similarly, contracts have been executed with two developmental nurse\nconsultants, Karen McGowan and Carolyn Smith. With the execution of the second consulting agreement on\nAugust 23, 1995, the defendants complied with paragraph 7 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction.\nTr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 82; Ex. 28, Hr'g, October 10, 1995; see Compliance Chart, Appendix 7.\nConversely, the State of Tennessee concedes that it has not complied with paragraph 2 of the Emergency Order\nand Preliminary Injunction. Tr., Hr'g, October 11, 1995, at 226 (\"[W]e are not asserting compliance with paragraph\n[36]\n2\").  Thus, the only two paragraphs as to which there is a dispute regarding compliance are paragraphs 1\n(retention of a full-time developmental physician) and 8 (hiring of 136 nurses).\nAs previously stated, \"the test for compliance by the defendants is whether the defendants took all reasonable\nsteps within their power to comply with the Court's order.\" Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703, 708 (6th Cir.1991).\nWhen a contemnor has taken part in shaping the order, generally courts have been unsympathetic to reasons\nasserted for less-than-substantial compliance. See Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276, 110 S.Ct. 625,\n632-33, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990); Glover, 934 F.2d at 708-709.\nIn this case, the requirement for retention of a developmental physician was first incorporated by the State of\n1312 Tennessee in the Stipulated Remedial Order of September 2, 1994. See Stipulated Remedial Order, *1312\ndocketed September 2, 1994, § VIA. Under the remedial plan, the State of Tennessee agreed to retain a\ndevelopmental physician by March 1, 1995. At the hearing on the First Semi-Annual Compliance Report, on April\n10, 1995, the State of Tennessee acknowledged that it has failed to meet its March 1, 1995, deadline, but\nadvised the Court that a developmental medicine physician had been retained and would report by June 1, 1995.\nA third deadline for retention of a developmental medicine physician was established at the emergency telephone\nhearing on June 30, 1995.\nThe State of Tennessee, having agreed to obtain a developmental medicine physician for ADC and having\nincorporated that provision into the agreed upon remedial plan, should not be allowed to avoid an obligation for\nwhich it bargained as part of the settlement of this case. The presence of a developmental medicine physician at\nADC is essential to the successful implementation of the remedial plan. Furthermore, from the record, it is clear\nthat the defendants should not be excused from compliance with paragraph 1. Therefore, defendants remain in\ncontempt as to that paragraph.\nWhile the State of Tennessee remains out of compliance regarding the requirement of a developmental medicine\nphysician, that does not resolve the issue of whether the full remedial and coercive sanctions imposed on the\nState to achieve compliance should remain in effect. That question should be considered in light of the extent of\nthe State's efforts since the imposition of sanctions and the extent of the State's success in achieving compliance\nas to the remaining provisions of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction.\nWhether the State has purged itself of contempt regarding paragraph 8 must also be determined. The dispute as\nto paragraph 8 relates to a construction of the language of that paragraph, and requires an examination of the\nhistory of the formulation of that paragraph and the testimony of witnesses regarding the requirement for 136\nnurses at ADC.\n\nOnce again, the origin of that paragraph rests in the Stipulated Remedial Order. Unlike paragraph 1, however, the\nRemedial Order did not require a specific number of nurses but only required that ADC have a sufficient number\nof nurses to meet the purposes of the Remedial Order. See Stipulated Remedial Order, docketed September 2,\n1994, § II.A. The State of Tennessee did, however, propose a requirement of 136 nurses in the Plan of Correction\ndrafted jointly with the United States and submitted as Exhibit 6 at the hearing of April 10, 1995. The applicable\nlanguage of paragraph \"II. C.1\" is as follows:\nDefendants shall have 136 nursing positions by April 14, 1995. These nurses will be on staff by\nJuly 1, 1995. Contract nurses will be utilized to fill vacancies, but will not serve on nutritional\nmanagement teams or provide the functions set out in paragraph 1 above. Defendants will make\nongoing efforts to fill these positions with Arlington nurse employees, rather than contract nurses.\nIt is anticipated that this number of nursing positions will decrease depending on the number and\ncharacteristics of the residents.\nPlan of Correction, Ex. 6, Hr'g, April 10, 1995, Paragraph II.C.1.\nGaye Hansen, the Facilitator of the Remedial Plan at ADC, clarified the meaning of subparagraph \"C\" in her\ntestimony on April 10, 1995. Tr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995, at 68; see supra pp. 1297-1298. It is clear from Ms.\nHansen's testimony that the Plan of Correction, as presented to the Court, contemplated the hiring of ADC nurse\nemployees to fill the 136 nursing positions approved by the State of Tennessee. Ms. Hansen made this doubly\nclear when she testified that, \"in the interim,\" positions would be filled with agency or contract nurses. The clear\nmeaning of Ms. Hansen's testimony was that agency or contract nurses would be employed only until state nurse\nemployees could be hired. This is consistent with the memorandum of Dr. Akers to Dr. Durbin dated March 14,\n1995, in which Dr. Akers observed that \"optimum coverage [136 state nurse employees] would end the incessant\n`Agency Nurse' emergency coverage, which is very expensive.\" Ex. 23, Hr'g, October 10, 1995; Appendix 3. Dr.\n1313 Akers' memorandum is also conclusive on the *1313 point that the 136 state nurse employees include nurse\nadministrators.\nThe State of Tennessee's own summary records clearly show that the 136 positions to which the Plan of\nCorrection referred are Tennessee nurse employee positions. See Appendix 2. There is no credible evidence to\nsuggest that, at any point, agency nurses were considered satisfactory to fill the positions created by the State of\nTennessee in response to the Plan of Correction. Tr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995, at 65; Ex. 23, Hr'g, October 10, 1995; \nsee supra notes 20-23. Moreover, even if contract nurses should be included in the calculation of 136 nurses\n(which they should not), under no construction of the information contained in Appendix 2, after removal of the\nMed Temps nurses as agency nurses, see supra note 23 and accompanying text, could the State be in\n[37]\ncompliance with the requirement for 136 Arlington employee nurses.  According to the plain language of\nparagraph 8 and applicable legal principles, it is clear that the State of Tennessee has failed to comply with\nparagraph 8 of the Preliminary Injunction and Emergency Order.\nThe effect of the State's hiring of essentially temporary individuals in larger numbers arguably reduced the\nadverse impact on ADC's residents of the State's failure to comply with its own remedial provision. This fact, just\nas the State's efforts to obtain developmental physician services, mitigates somewhat in favor of a modification of\nthe coercive and remedial sanctions imposed in connection with these provisions.\nThe record also reflects, however, that the State has been less than diligent in achieving prompt compliance with\nother provisions of the Emergency Order and/or Preliminary Injunction. See Compliance Chart, Appendix 7, ¶¶ 6,\n9, 14. Specifically, the State has not been successful in achieving compliance with the requirement for two\ndevelopmental nurses. The State has hired only one developmental nurse (Ex. 3, Hr'g, October 10, 1995).\nMoreover, to fill the developmental nurse slot, the State attempted to hire one individual solely for the purpose of\nhaving a person in that position even though the State admitted that the proposed person was not qualified for\nthe position. Tr. August 23, 1995, at 21 (candidate did not meet minimum requirements in State's own\nadvertisement for position). Moreover, the State met the August 30, 1995, deadline (paragraph 9) for agreements\nwith hospitals as to only one out of three hospitals and submitted no monthly report for the month of July 1995, as\nrequired by paragraph 14 of the Preliminary Injunction.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to understand why the State has been unable to marshal its resources and achieve\nrelatively simple ministerial tasks such as the filing of reports and the negotiation of hospital agreements in a\ntimely and effective manner. It is even more troubling that the State entered into an important agreement 00 the\n97\nagreement with Columbus Medical Services for interim developmental medicine physicians 00 without considering\n97\nbasic questions such as the need of those physicians to be licensed in Tennessee (so that they can practice in\nTennessee) and the need to have those physicians available for team consultations (just as the remedial plan\nrequired that a retained developmental physician be available). See Contempt Order, note 11. No explanation\nhas been offered by the State, other than the explanation contained in Appendix 6, regarding why a competent\nadministrator would overlook such obvious and important steps.\nFurthermore, the lack of urgency by State administrators, in light of the demonstrated life threatening risks posed\nby their inaction, is disturbing. For example, Commissioner Cardwell testified that she did not meet with the\nadministrators on her second weekend at Arlington because they had been \"working steady five days a week.\" Tr.\nHr'g, October 10, 1995, at 211. At the same time, she acknowledged that the institution still does not have an\n1314 overall plan for implementation *1314 of the remedy. Id. at 214. Commissioner Cardwell blamed that lack of an\noverall plan on a lack of responses from \"consultants\" but identified no effective efforts made to expedite those\nresponses or to work with administrators on an alternative strategy to complete a plan for implementation and to\nactually implement the State's own plan of corrective action.\nB. WHAT ARE THE BEST AND LEAST INTRUSIVE REMEDIAL\nSANCTIONS AVAILABLE?\nThe $1,000.00 a day fines as to the paragraphs as to the which the State is not in compliance are not seriously\ncontested. The State does not argue that those sanctions are inappropriate but only argues that as to two (2) of\nthe paragraphs they are in \"partial compliance\" and that the sanctions are no longer necessary. As previously\nnoted, however, Courts are particularly unsympathetic to excuses for less than substantial compliance where the\ncontemnor has participated in drafting the order against which compliance is measured. See Glover v. Johnson,\n934 F.2d at 708-09. The fines imposed as to paragraphs 1, 2, and 8 should, therefore, remain in effect until the\nState of Tennessee achieves compliance.\nThe more troubling question is whether or not the requirement that Commissioner Cardwell spend every fourth\n[38]\nweekend at Arlington Developmental Center until compliance is achieved should remain in effect.  It is clear\nfrom the testimony of Dr. Akers that he has made substantial efforts since the imposition of sanctions to improve\nthe delivery of patient care at Arlington Developmental Center. It is also clear that the retention of Director of\nNursing Lester has been an important step in improving nursing services at Arlington Developmental Center. The\nretention of at least one developmental nurse and of two developmental nurse consultants and the utilization of\ndevelopmental physicians from Columbus Medical Services, despite serious missteps in the initial contract\nnegotiation, all represent much needed change at Arlington Developmental Center.\nCommissioner Cardwell has testified that she is \"the chief executive officer with the State responsible for\ncomplying with the [Remedial Order].\" Tr. April 10, 1995, at 104. When specifically asked against whom sanctions\nshould be imposed for failure to comply, Commissioner Cardwell has insisted that she is the responsible party.\nTr., Hr'g, July 10, 1995, at 83. Based on her insistence, the Court has directed remedial sanctions against her.\nContempt Order, docketed August 24, 1995.\nIt is unclear, however, whether the Commissioner, despite her assertion that she is the chief executive officer for\n[39]\nthe State of Tennessee for Arlington Developmental Center, is involved in the day-to-day operations at ADC.\nFrom her testimony, it appears that she is far more familiar with other institutions run by the State of Tennessee\nand that, in fact, her visits to Arlington Developmental Center have served as an orientation for her to that facility.\nTr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 210. A substantial question exists regarding the identity of the person or persons\nagainst whom creative sanctions would be most effective in achieving the remedial purpose of the orders in this\ncase. Neither the United States nor the State of Tennessee (nor People First nor the Parent-Guardian\n\n1315 Association) have briefed all of the creative alternatives[40] which may be available *1315 to the Court in lieu of\nthe relatively simple, though highly effective sanction imposed.\nThe United States strongly argues that the Court should continue the only sanction which has been effective in\nachieving efforts towards compliance by the State of Tennessee. Undoubtedly, the requirement that the\nCommissioner spend every fourth weekend at Arlington Developmental Center initially was a very effective\nremedial sanction. It is equally clear, however, that since it appears the State may have made a deliberate\ndecision to change its course and not comply with the Remedial Order, Plan of Correction, and Preliminary\nInjunction, a more comprehensive sanction scheme, tailored to assure compliance in this complex environment\nwould be useful.\nThe United States shall, therefore, submit within thirty (30) days of the entry of this order a comprehensive legal\nanalysis of the remedies available for use in this case, including a proposed remedial sanction scheme. The\nState of Tennessee likewise may, but is not required to, submit its own proposed remedial sanctions scheme and\nthe authorities supporting it. Likewise, the intervenor and class representative, People First, and intervenor\nParent-Guardian Association may, but are not required to, submit within thirty (30) days such a proposal. Any\nparty may file a response to the initial filings of those parties submitting proposed remedial sanctions within\nfifteen (15) calendar days of the filing by the United States.\nThe Court will then consider whether or not it should adopt, as part of the remedies available in the context of\ncontempt as to the Preliminary Injunction (and the Contempt Order of August 24, 1995) any or all of the proposed\nremedial sanctions. The remedial sanctions proposals may also be considered as possible additions to the\nRemedial Order. The parties should focus on the problems enunciated in note 10 regarding how to require\ngovernment administrators to be responsive and the degree to which individual government administrators may\nbe personally sanctioned.\nAs an interim step, in lieu of the requirement that Commissioner Cardwell spend every fourth weekend at\n[41]\nArlington Developmental Center,  four (4) key administrators, Medical Director Akers, Superintendent Jackson,\nDirector of Nursing Lester, and Remedial Order Facilitator Hansen, are required to be available one day a month\nat Arlington Developmental Center for transcribed group and/or individual question and answer sessions. The\nMonitor may request the presence of additional persons at these sessions.\nThe sessions will focus on implementation not only of the Preliminary Injunction but also of the Remedial Order\nand Plan of Correction. The first question and answer session shall be scheduled within three (3) weeks of the\n[42]\ndate of entry of this order.  If satisfactory with the Monitor, the parties may schedule the session for a weekend\ndate if they conclude that such a schedule would least interfere with operations of the institution.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Since the Court's Order of August 24, 1995, there have been two deaths at ADC. See Appendix 1. There have\nbeen no admissions to ADC since the adoption of the remedial plan on September 2, 1994.\n[2] The total budget for ADC for 1995 is approximately $39 million of which approximately $26 million is paid by\nthe federal government. Tr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995, at 190 11. 2-4. ADC is funded under a series of ninety (90) day\nextensions obtained through the federal Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA\"). The State of Tennessee\nis currently pursuing a proposal with HCFA for inclusion of State services for the mentally retarded under\nTennCare. The State is actually pursing two (2) waivers 00 an 1115 waiver (known as a \"TennCare\" waiver) and a\n97\n1915 C waiver (known as a home and community based waiver). Id. at 155-156. The State anticipates that\ndevelopmentally disabled individuals will be included in the TennCare program as of January 1, 1996. Id. at 174\n(the goal of the State is to convert the residential and services component for this population into TennCare).\n[3] In Youngberg v. Romeo, the Supreme Court considered the substantive rights of involuntarily committed\nmentally retarded persons under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 457 U.S. 307,\n314, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2457, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). The Supreme Court found that \"[w]hen a person is\n\ninstitutionalized and wholly dependent on the state ... a duty to provide certain services and care does exist....\" \nId. at 317, 102 S.Ct. at 2459. Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the State has: \na duty to provide adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care. These are the essentials of the care that the\nstate must provide. The State also has the unquestioned duty to provide reasonable safety for all residents and\npersonnel within the institution ... [Residents enjoy] constitutionally protected interests in the conditions of\nreasonable care and safety, reasonable non-restrictive confinement conditions, and such training as may be\nrequired by these interests.\nId. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462; see also Collins v. City of Harker Heights, Texas, 503 U.S. 115, 127, 112 S.Ct.\n1061, 1069-70, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992) (\"Due Process Clause of its own force requires that conditions of\nconfinement satisfy certain minimum standards ... for persons in mental institutions\").\n[4] Dr. O'Neall had previously served by agreement of the parties as the Expert Facilitator in assisting the parties\nin negotiation of the remedial plan and in drafting alternatives for a court-imposed plan should the parties not\nreach agreement. Of course, because the parties reached agreement, no plan was imposed by the Court.\n[5] The implementation schedule contains approximately 103 deadlines for more than 150 requirements. The\ndeadlines vary from actions to be taken \"immediately\" (i.e., beginning as of September 1, 1994) to some actions\nto be completed 36 months from the plan commencement date. For example, nurse staffing pursuant to\nparagraph \"II.A.\" was to be completed within three months (i.e., by December 1, 1994). Similarly, a chief\npsychologist (paragraph \"II.B.\") and staff psychologists (paragraph \"II.C.\") were to be retained within three\nmonths (i.e., by December 1, 1994). A psychiatrist (paragraph \"II.E.\") was to be retained within thirty days (i.e., by\nOctober 1, 1994). A Developmental Medicine Physician (paragraph \"VI.A.\") was to be retained within six months\n(i.e., by March 1, 1995). The effectiveness of certain provisions was dependent on timely completion of other\nprovisions. For example, various committees were to begin to function within specified periods of time and the\nfunctioning of those committees was dependent upon the professionals being retained within the timeline set out\nin the agreed-upon implementation schedule. See, e.g., paragraph III.L. (Behavior Management Committee,\nbeginning at six months; i.e., March 1, 1995).\n[6] The record reflects that as of April 10, 1995, the Commissioner had not read the November 22, 1993, findings\nof the Court. See Tr., Hr'g, April 10, 1995, at 115 ll. 9-12. The State, therefore, included in its Plan of Correction a\nrequirement that the Commissioner of Mental Health/Mental Retardation and certain other senior administrators\nat ADC and the State central office: \"Must certify within thirty (30) days that they have read, in their entirety, the\nCourt's Opinion, Preliminary Injunction, Findings of Fact, Remedial Order, and Monitor's Compliance Report.\"\nPlan of Correction, Ex. 6, ¶ V, Hr'g, April 10, 1995.\n[7] As of June 30, 1995, only 106 nurses were working at ADC; this number included not just \"Arlington nurse\nemployees\" as specified by the Plan of Correction but also contract and agency nurses. Compare Tr., Hr'g, July\n10, 1995, at 94 (Commissioner Cardwell) with Ex. 4, Hr'g, October 10, 1995 (ADC Nursing Status, August 11,\n1995); see also Appendix 2. While the number of nurses employed at ADC as of the date of the April 10, 1995,\nPlan of Correction was not the subject of proof at that hearing, a memo by Dr. Phillip Akers, ADC Medical\nDirector, shows that on March 14, 1995, ADC employed a total of 98 nurses. Ex. 23, Hr'g, October 10, 1995;\nAppendix 3. Thus, between March 14, 1995, and June 30, 1995, ADC obtained the services of only an additional\neight nurses.\n[8] The remedial provisions of the June 30, 1995, Emergency Order (docketed July 3, 1995) had been drafted\nwith the participation of the parties, and were telecopied to the Court for review prior to the telephone conference.\nTr., Hr'g, June 30, 1995, at 14 ll. 1-4. The State expressly agreed that the situation required the proposed\nemergency remedial steps and asserted that the State had \"already begun to take steps to put those measures in\nplace.\" Tr., Hr'g, June 10, 1995, at 15 11 12-14; Tr., Hr'g, June 30, 1995, at 35-36. Other than extending the\ndeadline for obtaining a Developmental Medicine Physician by two days (to July 5, 1995), the Court made no\nchanges in the proposed remedial action or deadlines. See Tr., Hr'g, June 30, 1995, at 39.\n[9] A portion of the transcript was sealed after a request by counsel for the State of Tennessee that counsel be\nallowed to make certain disclosures under seal. The United States agreed with that request and the Court\n\nindicated that subsequent portions of the transcript would be placed under seal subject to a later motion that the\nmaterials be unsealed. \nThe Court has carefully considered its obligations in connection with the material submitted under seal prior to\nthe hearing of August 9, 1995. A judge is obligated to follow the law. Therefore, in this case, it would be\ninappropriate for the Court to unseal the sealed portions of the August 9, 1995, transcript.\nAt the same time, the material disclosed to the Court is not \"extrajudicial information\" but, rather, is information\ndisclosed properly during the course of a proceeding and is information on which the judge may rely, along with\nall of the other information in the record, in reaching conclusions. The Court has carefully considered whether the\ndisclosures constitute evidence of a offer of compromise which would be excludable as evidence pursuant to\nRule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. From the transcript, it does not appear that Rule 408 is applicable.\nTr., Hr'g, August 9, 1995, at 9 ll. 16-17 (Maloy). Moreover, even if applicable, the information submitted may be\nconsidered for purposes of establishing bias or motive. Fed.R.Evid. 408.\nIn the Contempt Order of August 24, 1995, it was not necessary to consider the implication of the fact disclosed\nby the State in the sealed portion of the transcript. TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 722 F.2d 1261, 1273 (6th\nCir.1983) (holding that there is no intent requirement for civil contempt). The disclosure of the State, however, is\nrelevant on the issue of purgation of contempt and any assertion of impossibility (or good faith) by the defendant,\nas well as on the issue of the continued necessity of coercive and remedial sanctions. See United States v. Work\nWear Corp., 602 F.2d 110 (6th Cir.1979).\nIn that context, it should be noted that based on the information submitted under seal by the State of Tennessee\non August 9, 1995, it appeared that the State, at least as of that date, no longer intended to implement the\nagreed upon remedy at ADC. Tr., Hr'g, August 9, 1995, at 9 ll. 16-17, 23 ll. 19-25 (under seal at the request of the\nState).\n[10] Achieving accountability and responsiveness by governmental entities and officials poses special problems\nfor courts in fashioning civil coercive and remedial sanctions for failure of those officials and entities to comply\nwith Court orders. While private individuals and corporations may be highly motivated by the prospect of\nsignificant financial losses since the financial fates of individuals and their businesses are closely tied, public\nofficials are, in many respects, essentially independent from the effect of financial losses imposed on the\ngovernmental entity by whom they are employed. \nMoreover, in dealing with publicly funded entities, fines are often an indiscriminate and potentially\ncounterproductive means of enforcing compliance. Thus the value of fines in forcing a governmental entity to\ncomply with either an agreed upon or imposed court order is often largely symbolic and generally must be\nnarrowly crafted in order to avoid impairing the ability of the governmental entity to perform the tasks required by\nthe order. Moreover, public policy concerns regarding the possible impairment of delivery of important social\nservices dictate that special attention be given to craft remedies that in fact require the public official and\ngovernmental entity to perform his or her or its function as opposed to penalizing innocent taxpayers and\nindividuals in need of critical public services.\n[11] The full text of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction are set out in Appendices 4 and 5\nrespectively. Other provisions under the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction have now also become due\nand are discussed infra pp. ___ - ___. See Appendices 2, 3, 7.\n[12] There are two kinds of contempt: civil and criminal. Criminal contempt may be used by a court to punish a\ncontemnor and vindicate the authority of the court. International Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell,\n___ U.S. ___, ___, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 2557, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994); Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., 221\nU.S. 418, 441, 31 S.Ct. 492, 498, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911). Criminal contempt proceedings, however, entitle the\ncontemnor to certain constitutional protections associated with other criminal cases. See Hicks v. Feiock, 485\nU.S. 624, 632, 108 S.Ct. 1423, 1429-30, 99 L.Ed.2d 721 (1988). \nThus, it is important to distinguish between the two types of contempt. Given that either fine or imprisonment may\nbe used as a sanction for either type of contempt, it is the \"character and purpose\" of the punishment that\ndifferentiates civil from criminal contempt. Gompers, 221 U.S. at 441, 31 S.Ct. at 498. When the sanction is\n\npunitive, the contempt proceeding is criminal in nature; when the sanction is coercive or remedial, the contempt\nproceeding is civil in nature. See Hicks, 485 U.S. at 632, 108 S.Ct. at 1429-30; Gompers, 221 U.S. at 442, 31\nS.Ct. at 498 (\"[I]mprisonment for civil contempt is ordered where the defendant has refused to do an affirmative\naction required by the provisions of an order which, either in form or substance, was mandatory in character\").\n[13] This Court has found the State of Tennessee to be in civil contempt, and there appears to be no contention\nthat this characterization is somehow incorrect.\n[14] Whether a contemnor has complied with the court order for which it was held in contempt is a distinct inquiry\nfrom a finding of contempt. In a civil contempt proceeding, a finding of contempt must be based on clear and\nconvincing proof that the alleged contemnor violated a prior order of the court. Glover v. Johnson, 934 F.2d 703,\n707 (6th Cir.1991); see infra part III.B.2 (discussing the legal standard for judging compliance).\n[15] In a contempt proceeding for failure to comply with a court order, the contemnor has a defense if it is\nfactually impossible to comply with the order. United States v. Rylander, 460 U.S. 752, 757, 103 S.Ct. 1548,\n1552-53, 75 L.Ed.2d 521 (1983); Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 75-76, 68 S.Ct. 401, 411-12, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948).\nThe contemnor, however, has the burden of production with respect to this defense. Id.; but see United States v.\nBryan, 339 U.S. 323, 330, 70 S.Ct. 724, 730, 94 L.Ed. 884 (1950) (\"[O]ne charged with contempt of court for\nfailure to comply with a court order makes a complete defense by proving that he is unable to comply\")\n(emphasis supplied); Nabkey v. Hoffius, 827 F.Supp. 450, 453 (W.D.Mich.1993) (holding that the contemnor has\nthe burden of proving inability to comply). Failure to comply with a court order will not be excused for \"mere\nfinancial hardship.\" United States v. Work Wear Corp., 602 F.2d 110, 116 (6th Cir.1979). Further, a present\ninability to comply that results from the contemnor's own actions will not be a defense to contempt. United States\nv. Lay, 779 F.2d 319, 320 (6th Cir.1985) (holding no defense for \"self-induced inability to comply\" where \"the\ndefendant consciously and willfully placed himself in a financial status in order to avoid responsibility for\ncomplying with the court orders\"); see also Bryan, 339 U.S. at 330-31, 70 S.Ct. at 730; United States v. Asay, 614\nF.2d 655, 660 (9th Cir.1980).\n[16] For the diligence efforts test rejected by this Circuit, see, e.g., Newman v. Graddick, 740 F.2d 1513, 1525\n(11th Cir.1984) (holding that \"a person who attempts with reasonable diligence to comply with a court order\nshould not be held in contempt\").\n[17] Of the seven witnesses called by the defendants, four had no significant contact with ADC until after July 1,\n1995. Grunow and Womack are state employees who became involved with recruiting at ADC after July 5, 1995,\nAskins began working as a psychiatrist at ADC on August 14, 1995, and Lester began working as Director of\nNursing on September 15, 1995. Tr. Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 23 (Grunow), 29 (Womack), 158 (Askins), 173\n(Lester). Three witnesses with longer experience with ADC were called by the State: (1) an assistant\nCommissioner (Durbin), (2) the ADC Medical Director (Akers), and (3) a consultant (Palmer).\n[18] The subject of who would employ a developmental physician (either the University of Tennessee or the State\nof Tennessee) and the applicable benefits package has been the subject of inquiry at hearings on July 10, 1995,\nand August 9, 1995. See Contempt Order, docketed August 24, 1995, at 8, 16.\n[19] It is significant that, while the requirement for two developmental nurses was first included in the June 30,\n1995, Emergency Order, and was repeated in the July 10, 1995, Preliminary Injunction, no advertisement was\nplaced for these positions prior to August 9, 1995. A two week deadline was established at the August 9, 1995,\nhearing. The advertisements were then placed on August 17, 1995, and ran on August 20, 1995. It would appear\nthat prior to August 9, 1995, the defendants did not intend to fill the developmental nurse positions. See Appendix\n6.\n[20] Specifically, Ms. Womack testified regarding the \"different categories of nurses working at Arlington\" as\nfollows: \nQ. Now, I see on that there are different categories of nurses working at Arlington?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What are those categories?\nA. The categories are State employees, contract employees and agency employees.\nQ. Okay. Will you please define for the Court what each one of those categories 00 who comprises each one of\n97\nthose categories?\nA. Yes, ma'am. The category of State employee, of course, is those individuals that we have interviewed and\nemployed as a full-time State employee that's assigned a full-time schedule at Arlington. The category of contract\nemployee is made up to two agreements, that's the guardian health care group. The guardian health care group\nis a contract that furnishes full-time foreign nurses to Arlington to be placed in full-time regular schedule work.\nThey have been with us since 00 1993 was the original contract. The other agency is the Med Temps. Med Temps\n97\nis a placement agency that's a part of Memphis-Shelby County Medical Society. They place full-time transitional\nemployees with us. Those nurses spend 190 days with us on a probationary status and then they can go into a 00\n97\nthey apply to get on our State register and then they can go in for a full-time State position which is our goal for\nthose nurses as well. The other category is agency nurses. The agency nurses are made up of three contractual\narrangements. They are with nurse Express, Staff Builders and Clinicall. Those three agencies supply nurses that\nwe are familiar with that we have requested by name that contract as a three-week renewable contract, but it is a\nthree-week renewable contract because of funding limitations and funding requirements. Those nurses are\nplaced on a monthly schedule, they work full-time, they show up for work just like the State employee and the\ncontract employee do.\nQ. Okay. Now, as far as the Med Temp nurses, on the August 11th report, were they listed as contract or agency\nemployees?\nA. They were listed as agency employees on August the 11th.\nTr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 33-35 (emphasis supplied).\n[21]See supra note 20.\n[22] The Plan of Correction submitted by the State on April 10, 1995, was created based on the characterization\nof nurses at that time. Ex. 6, Hr'g, April 10, 1995. Thus, for purposes of complying with the Plan of Correction\nsubmitted by the State, Med Temps nurses should be counted as agency nurses.\n[23] Appendix 2 shows that on September 8, 1995, 28 \"agency\" nurses were employed at ADC. On September\n15, when the \"agency\" category was reduced by moving Med Temps nurses to the \"contract\" category, the\nremaining number of \"agency\" nurses was reduced to 16. See Appendix 2. Therefore, the number of Med Temps\nnurses, as of September 15, 1995, appears to have been 12. Subtracting the Med Temps nurses from the\ncontract nurses for each reported period from September 15 to October 4, 1995, it is clear that, even under the\ndefendants' theory, at no time between August 11, 1995, and October 10, 1995, was the State of Tennessee in\ncompliance with the April 10, 1995, Plan of Correction, the June 30, 1995, Emergency Order, or the July 10,\n1995, Preliminary Injunction. See supra note 22; see also Appendices 2, 6 (sealed portion of August 9, 1995,\ntranscript).\n[24]See supra pp. 1305-1306 (discussion of licensure of Columbus Medical Services physicians).\n[25] The October 5, 1995, amendment also addressed another shortcoming of the original contract. Prior to the\namendment, the physicians provided by Columbus Medical Services had not attended scheduled meetings with\nthe other staff on a patient's team. See Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 73-74; see also infra pp. 1308-1309. The\npertinent provisions reads as follows: \nColumbus Medical Services agrees that all DD physician consultations for persons who live at Arlington\nDevelopmental Center will include face-to-face meetings with members of the person's team and the person's\nprimary care physician.\nEx. 7, ¶ A.2., Hr'g, October 10, 1995.\n\n[26] The four primary care physicians, according to Dr. Akers, had \"no prior experience whatever in the field of\ndevelopmental disabilities.\" Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 88.\n[27] While all of these activities are not directly relevant to whether the defendants have purged themselves of\ncontempt as to the five uncompleted provisions of the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction, they are\nrelevant to efforts to achieve the overall remedial objective as set out in the Contempt Order. Contempt Order,\ndocketed August 24, 1995, at 14.\n[28] Dr. Akers described the contributions of the developmental physicians to improved care at ADC as\n\"enormous.\" Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 74 l. 13. According to Dr. Akers: \nWe're getting a holistic look at the medical care of these persons ... so we're evaluating people at a higher level\nthan previously done. The value of the team is that this process is literally teaching the team how to do business.\nNow [physicians and nurse practitioners are] sitting down with a document written by a master physician, a\ndevelopmental pediatrician addressing each of these issues. There could be no finer teaching tool for our staff\nmedical providers than these consultations.\nId. at 74-75.\n[29]See supra note 25 (discussing the October 5, 1995, amendment to the contract between the State of\nTennessee and Columbus Medical Services to remedy the unavailability of the developmental physicians for\nteam meetings).\n[30] Dr. Akers also indicated that he and Commissioner Cardwell discussed his request for transfer to\nCloverbottom, a Tennessee ICFMR facility located in Middle Tennessee. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 129.\n[31] Dr. Askins is scheduled to attend a meeting of the National Association for Dually Diagnosed Persons in\nAllentown, Pennsylvania, as well as a conference sponsored by Columbus Medical Services in November in New\nOrleans, Louisiana. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 163. Dr. Askins does not have a background in behavioral\npsychology. Id. at 164.\n[32] Commissioner Cardwell further explained that: \nThe implementation plan is not all complete because of not having concrete information back from some of the\nconsultants with which the staff had worked.\nTr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 217.\n[33] During her weekend visits, Commissioner Cardwell investigated deficiencies cited by the Monitor and her\ndevelopmental medicine physician, checked the activity schedules of residents to see if they were being\nmaintained, observed the organizational structure at ADC, checked on operations during the second and third\nshift, and observed problems in nursing distribution. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 197, 202, 206-07, 208-09.\nOne of the conclusions that Commissioner Cardwell reached as a result of her visits was that, \"We had to have a\ntop notch Director of Nursing as soon as possible.\" Id. at 197.\n[34] Exhibit and testimony referred to in this subsection are exhibits and testimony introduced at the October 10,\n1995, hearing unless otherwise noted.\n[35] This was the first such current at-risk list developed. Tr., Hr'g, October 10, 1995, at 124.\n[36] Linda Ross, counsel for the State of Tennessee stated in closing argument as follows: \nParagraph two, which sets out the duties of a developmental physician is linked, of course, to paragraph one, of\ncourse, requiring the permanent full-time physician and to paragraph six requiring developmental nurses by\nOctober 23rd. Without those persons, paragraph 6 cannot be fully satisfied, and we are not asserting compliance\nwith paragraph two.\nTr., Hr'g, October 11, 1995, at 226.\n\n[37] The apparent reason that ADC has not proceeded to hire 136 state employee nurses as required under the\nPlan of Correction and as required in the Emergency Order and Preliminary Injunction is contained in Appendix 6.\nSee Tr., Hr'g, August 9, 1995, at 9 (under seal at the request of the State).\n[38] The requirement that Commissioner Cardwell spend every fourth weekend at ADC is currently the subject of\na stay by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Tennessee v. United States, No. 95-6185 (6th Cir. October 13, 1995).\nSee National Labor Relat. Bd. v. Cincinnati Bronze, Inc., 829 F.2d 585, 588 (6th Cir.1987).\n[39] It should be noted that the Superintendent at Arlington Developmental Center, Max Jackson, has yet to\ntestify at any proceedings in this case. Mr. Jackson is charged with the day-to-day management of ADC and\nplays an important role in implementation of key provisions of the remedial plan.\n[40] For example, creative alternatives might include a requirement of an administrator's off-hours schedule (to\ncover weekends, second and third shifts), imposition of an administrator to more closely monitor the day-to-day\nprogress at Arlington Developmental Center, imposition of a direct administrative penalty or bonus system\ndependent on the percentage of compliance obtained with the overall Remedial Plan or Plan of Correction or\nPreliminary Injunction. Such types of alternatives should be considered not only in the context of defendants'\ncontempt concerning the preliminary injunction but also at any later proceeding should the defendants be found\nin contempt concerning implementation of the Remedial Order or Plan of Correction.\n[41] The requirement that Commissioner Cardwell spend every fourth weekend is removed.\n[42] If the parties are unable to reach agreement regarding the first question and answer session, the Court will\nset a date and time. The Monitor will preside at each session. See Stipulated Remedial Order § XV B.5. and C.\nEach party and/or counsel may be present and may make inquiry and request documentation. Document\nrequests and questions may be submitted in advance of the question and answer sessions (for information and\ndocuments to be produced at the session) or at the session itself (for information and documents to be produced\nat the session). A purpose of the sessions will be to facilitate information gathering by the parties. See\nFed.R.Civ.P. 26.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nOffice of Legislative Affairs\nOffice of tbe AtxittiM Attorney Gcaen!  Wathington. D.C.  20330\nMAR  I 2  i99i\nREGISTERED MAIL\nRETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED\n•l!l\n• ll U.S. v. Tennessee\nGovernor's Office\nState Capitol\nNashville, Tennessee  37219\nRe:  findings of Investigation. Arlington Developmental\nCenter\nDear Governor McWherter:\nBy letter dated July 11, 1990, we notified you that,\npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act,\n42 U.S.C. §1997 £t S33.', the Civil Rights Division of the United\nStates Department of Justice was commencing an investigation into\nconditions at Arlington Developmental Center (Arlington), a\nfacility for mentally retarded persons located in Arlington,\nTennessee.  As specified by the statute, we are now writing to\ninform you of the conditions at Arlington that we have found are\ndepriving residents there of their constitutional and Fede.ral\nstatutory rights, the facts supporting our conclusions, and the\nminimum measures we believe may remedy those conditions.\nOur investigation consisted, first, of several comprehensive\ntours of Arlington with independent experts, most recently on\nDecember 14 and 15, 1990.  We observed conditions in all the\nresidential units yf Arlington at various times of the day,\ninterviewed administrators, staff and residents, and examined\na variety of records.  Further, we gathered and analyzed\ndocumentation relating to the operation of Arlington, including,\nbut not limited to:  a variety of policies and procedures;\ninformation relating to staffing; minutes from various\ncommittees; incident and injury reports; mortality reviews; abuse\ninvestigations; list of residents on medications; and residents'\nrecords.  Throughout the investigation, we received complete\ncooperation from the administrators and staff at Arlington.  We\nlook forward to continued cooperation.\n\n•2 -\nBased upon our extensive investigation, we have  concluded\nthat conditions at Arlington deprive its mentally  retarded\nresidents of their constitutional rights to adequate medical\ncare, reasonable safety, and such training as an appropriate\nprofessional would consider reasonable to ensure their safety and\nfreedom from undue bodily restraints, Younaberq v. Romeo   457\nf\nU.S. 307, 324  (1982).  These conditions, which seriously  threaten\nresidents' health and safety,  include:\n1. Neglect and abuse of residents.\n2. Failure to provide adequate medical care,\nspecifically:\n(a)  Failure to adequately diagnose and treat\nresidents.\n(b)  Failure to provide essential  physical\ntherapy services.\n(c)  Failure to provide sufficient numbers of\nappropriately trained staff to render\nand implement professional  judgments\nregarding necessary medical  treatment.\n3. Failure to provide required training to residents,\nspecifically:\n(a)  Failure to provide  professionally\ndesigned  individualized training and\nbehavioral programs.\n(b)  Failure to provide sufficient numbers  of\n.  appropriately trained staff to  implement\nprofessional judgments  regarding\ntraining of residents.\n4.  Failure to provide a free appropriate public\neducation for school-age residents as required  by\nthe Education of the Handicapped Act.\n5.  Failure to provide a safe environment.\nSet forth below are our findings and recommendations.\n1.  Arlington Residents Are Subjected to Neglect ^nd Abuse.\nThe failure to provide care or training that a qualified\nprofessional would consider appropriate can be deemed  \"neglect.\nAt Arlington, however, lack of care sometimes rises to  active\nneglect, neglect that harms residents, many of whom spend their\n\nr\n- 3 -\nlives at the facility.  One consultant who recently toured the\nfacility voiced the concern that:\nArlington has failed to implement even the most basic\nchanges of the twentieth century.  They are providing\nonly the proverbial three hots and a cot.  In doing so,\nthey are creating a new generation of multihandicapped\nindividuals, when in some cases, there is no need for\nthese handicaps to exist, other than neglect.\nDuring the investigation, we observed young children, some\nas young as two, whose limbs were severely contracted.  Our\nexperts believed that these contractures were avoidable.  Many\nresidents were left unattended in cribs, with no efforts being\nmade to move their limbs, position them, or to provide any real\nphysical therapy services.  The failure to actively move,\nreposition, and exercise such residents results in potentially\ncrippling and irreversible physical deterioration.  We observed\none five year old boy, unattended in his crib, hitting the side\nof his head with his fist due to a lack of stimulation.  No one\nwas paying attention to the boy other than an overworked direct\ncare worker holding his arm when and if she observed the\nbehavior.  The penis of another resident, a paraplegic with an\nin-dwelling Foley catheter, was eroded throughout its entire\nlength due to inadequate care and monitoring.  In many units,\nthere was a pervasive smell of urine.  Residents in diapers were\nwet; often their clothes were soaked through with urine.  Besides\nthe direct care staff shortages that permitted these conditions,\nthere was an apparent tolerance of such conditions as well.  Our\nexperts concluded that this lack of care constitutes active\nneglect.  <-\nIn three abuse investigations that we reviewed, outside\nphysicians who were consulted by residents' families concluded\nthat the residents had been abused.  These were the only abuse\ninvestigations in which outside physicians had examined the\ninjured Arlington residents.  In these three cases, Arlington\ndiscounted the outside physicians' findings.  As such, the\ninvestigations undertaken by Arlington and/or the Department of\nHuman Services (DHS) reveal a lack of commitment to uncovering\nsuch abuse or neglect, and, therefore, imply tolerance for such\nactions.  A number of staff reported that it would serve no\npurpose to report abuse to the administration of Arlington;\nnothing would be done.  This belief is confirmed by one case that\nwe reviewed.  In that case, direct care staff who belatedly\nreported that another direct care worker had abused a resident\nwere disciplined more harshly for the late reports than was the\nstaff member who abused the resident and her supervisor who\nwitnessed and had not reported the incident.  Certainly, the\nmessage sent to those staff members was not to report such\nincidents.  The obvious result of this apparent tolerance of\nabuse and lack of vigor when investigating such cases is harm to\n\nArlington residents.  Because reporting of abuse is discounted by\nArlington, staff are not trained in detection of abuse and\nindependent opinions are not sought to ascertain whether\nsuspicious injuries are the result of abuse.\nWe have concluded that abuse is occurring at Arlington,  our\nconclusion that Arlington residents are being abused is not\nlimited to physical abuse.  Our investigation revealed that staff\nat Arlington have verbally abused residents.  These actions have\napparently also been tolerated or discounted by the\nadministration.  j\n2.  Arlington Residents Do Not Receive Adequate Medical Care\na.  Failure to adequately diagnose and treat residents.\nOur consultant found that Arlington lacks long range\nplanning for managing residents with chronic medical conditions.\nRoutine procedures for testing residents' blood levels and\nmonitoring the course of chronic diseases were not  implemented.\nFor example, routine testing of vomitus for blood was not\naccomplished for a resident who, on numerous occasions, had\nsymptoms of gastric bleeding.  Our consultant found that the\nfailure to order such tests substantially departed from accepted\nmedical practice.  There were inadequate efforts to diagnose\nresidents' problems, a process essential to appropriate treatment\nand evaluation of the efficacy of treatment.  As a result,\nresidents' physical conditions have deteriorated.  In fact, five\nArlington residents have died since October 10, 1990.  The\nmedical care provided to these residents, three of whom were less\nthan 23 years old, was inadequate.  Additionally, Arlington does\nnot have a system to  detect the onset of ^insidious illnesses.\nBecause changes in residents' physical conditions are not-\nroutinely identified or monitored, their conditions may\ndeteriorate and become quite serious before medical treatment is\ninitiated.  We have concluded that the care and treatment of\nresidents with chronic conditions substantially departs from\naccepted medical practice.\nOur consultants found that Arlington has no procedure for\nmonitoring the effectiveness of medications prescribed.  As a\nresult, residents are not treated for side effects or may\ncontinue to receive medications that are not effective and do not\nresolve their medical conditions.  Generally, our consultants\nfound that documentation of medical evaluations and treatment is\ninadequate, especially for residents with more serious and\nchronic diseases.  Due to a failure to document ongoing health\ncare problems, Arlington does not provide adequate preventative\nhealth care.  There are also unacceptable delays in placing\nhospital communications, i.e., discharge summaries and emergency\nroom reports, in residents' charts.  Because current and complete\nmedical information is not maintained in the chart, professional\n\n-s-\nand direct care staff lack important information on which to base\ntheir judgments and services.  This deficiency subjects residents\nof Arlington to unnecessary risk of harm from inappropriate\ntreatment decisions.\nOur consultants found that Arlington does not attempt to\ndiagnose residents' underlying psychiatric disorders and fails to\nmonitor positive and negative effects when psychotropic\nmedications are prescribed.  Some residents receiving\npsychotropics do not benefit from them, while others who might\nbenefit do not receive them.  Our consultants also found that\nArlington automatically reduced or eliminated such medications\nwith inadequate justification.  In light of the above, our\nconsultants concluded that psychotropic medications are not being\nprescribed or monitored consistent with professional standards.\nBecause such medications can have serious deleterious side\neffects, prescription of the wrong medication and failure to\nproperly monitor them subjects residents to undue risk of harm.\nAdditionally, there is a significant danger that psychotropic\nmedications may be used as chemical restraints.\nOur consultants found that residents are not referred to or\nseen by consulting physicians as frequently as their conditions\nrequire.  Specifically, residents with neurological and\northopedic problems and conditions are not identified, managed,\nevaluated, or treated consistent with the judgment of qualified\nprofessionals.  Our consultants observed residents having\nseizures whose seizure activity was not noticed by Arlington's\ndirect care and nursing staff.  Such failure to identify and\nrecord seizure activity clearly results in harm to these\nresidents.  Dramatic evidence of the failure to manage such\nconditions was the death in December of a resident who had been\nhaving numerous seizures and is believed to have died as a result\nof a seizure.  Our expert concluded that the medical care\nprovided this resident was clearly inadequate.  The predictable\nresult of these deficiencies in medical care is unnecessary risk\nof harm to Arlington residents.\nb.  failure to provide essential physical therapy services.\nAfter an exhaustive review of the physical therapy services\noffered at Arlington, our consultant concluded that Arlington is\nfailing to adequately provide such services and that such failure\nconstituted a serious deficiency in residents' medical care.  In\na population of approximately 250 physically handicapped\nresidents, none receive hands on therapy from a physical\ntherapist.  Moreover, our expert found that residents' physical\ntherapy programs are not individualized and do not address their\nspecific needs.  The failure to provide necessary physical\ntherapy services results in contractures, physical degeneration,\ninappropriate body growth, and deformity that, in turn, subjects\nresidents to eating, digestion, and general medical problems\n\n•:•:* I\n(e.g.  respiratory difficulties due to scoliosis).  The failure\nf\nto provide appropriate evaluations, goals, and services often\nresults in physical deterioration.  Our consultant found that\nArlington's improper positioning of residents has actually\nincreased their deformities.  She found that .such harm vas\nattributable to both inadequate and inappropriate physical\ntherapy programs and inadequate numbers of adequately trained\nstaff.\nOur consultant physical therapist concluded that the use of\nadaptive equipment at Arlington often does not reflect the\nexercise of judgment by a qualified professional.  Inappropriate\nuse of such equipment jeopardizes the health and safety of\nresidents.  Ill-fitting adaptive equipment, including\nwheelchairs, does not provide adequate support, thereby\nincreasing the risk of accidental injury and physical\ndeterioration.  Numerous residents who once sat in wheelchairs\nare now confined to carts.  This is dramatic evidence of such\nphysical deterioration.  Our consultant found that the\ndeformities of these cart-bound residents were a result of\nimproper positioning and inadequate physical therapy services.\nAdditionally, the carts themselves are dangerous.  Incident\nreports reviewed during the investigation reflect that a number\nof residents have been injured when they fell out of unstable\ncarts.  Moreover, our nurse consultant observed that Arlington is\nnot providing adequate assistive devices to enable residents to\nwalk and move.  The natural result of the failure to provide such\ndevices is resident injury and physical deterioration.\nArlington is failing to provide physical therapy services\nand staff to render appropriate and necessary care to address the\nphysical therapy needs of the residents of vArlington and to\nimplement physical therapy services programs consistent with\nqualified professional judgment,  gee Younaberq v. Romeo. supra.\nat 324.\n(c)  Failure to provide sufficient numbers of\nappropriately trained staff to render and implement\nprofessional judgments regarding necessary medical\ntreatment.\nOur investigation revealed that the nursing department is\ncritically short staffed.  There are not enough adequately\ntrained nurses at Arlington, a deficiency that places residents\nat an unreasonable risk of harm.  For example, our consultant\nobserved nurses inappropriately dispensing medications to\nphysically handicapped residents, e.g.. by means of a tongue\nblade placed down residents' throats.  Our consultant found that\nthis method of medicating physically involved residents may\nresult in harm.  Nurses are not promptly hired to replace those\nthat leave.  Because of these shortages, nurses often \"'float* to\nareas to which they are not typically assigned and where they are\n\n- 7 -\nresponsible for caring for residents with whom they are not\nfamiliar.  It is not unusual for one nurse, assigned to a unit as\na floater, to administer medications to 128 residents twice in\none 8 hour shift.  The potential for medication errors in Buch\ncircumstances is obvious.  While Arlington officially reported\nonly two medication errors over a time frame, our consultants'\nreview of residents' records as well as information obtained from\nother sources suggests that these figures seriously\n.underrepresent the breadth of that problem at Arlington.\nAt the time of our latest tour, December 1990, there were\nonly three physicians, including the Medical Director, to provide\nmedical care to almost 500 developmentally disabled Arlington\nresidents.  Many of these residents have serious physical\ndisabilities and complex medical needs.  In our expert's view,\nthree primary care physicians are not sufficient to examine 500\nresidents, review their charts, adjust their medications, and\nkeep abreast of their medical condition, i.e., to render\ndecisions with respect to care that are consistent with\nprofessional judgments.  The shortage results in a failure to\nadequately manage, evaluate, and treat chronic medical\nconditions.\nWhile Arlington has contracted with a number of specialists\nto examine and treat its residents, our experts consider that the\nhours contracted for are not sufficient to provide a level of\ncare consistent with professional standards.  For example,\nArlington has a contract providing for neurology consultation\nthree times per year.  This is not adequate to properly evaluate,\ntreat, and follow the more than 260 residents with seizure\ndisorders.  Similarly, of those residents', records that we\nreviewed, a majority of residents with physical disabilities had\nnot received an orthopedic consultation within the past two\nyears.  Our investigation also revealed that necessary orthopedic\nsurgery is not recommended or undertaken because appropriate\ntherapy and follow-up is not available.  In our consultants'\nopinion, given the serious physical impairments of many of\nArlington's residents, this level of consultation and care is\nseriously inadequate.\nAs discussed above, there is a critical shortage of physical\ntherapists.  There are approximately 250 residents in need of\nphysical therapy services; Arlington contracts with two part-time\nphysical therapists who work a combined total of 28-30 hours per\nweek.  Our consultants concluded that 30 hours per week is\ntotally inadequate to provide necessary physical therapy services\nto all Arlington residents who need them.  Additionally, the\ndirect care staff receives no training in physical management and\npositioning of these physically handicapped residents.  Our\nconsultants found that the failure to move, reposition, exercise,\nand provide hands on physical therapy to such residents leads to\nphysical deterioration and other harm.\n\njy^ris\n- 8-\nStaff at Arlington does not adequately identify or care for\nresidents with impaired eating ability.  Staff fail to properly\nposition residents during meals, utilize appropriate feeding\ntechniques, and effectively monitor residents.  Because of thi6,\nArlington residents face serious risks of aspiration, a leading\ncause of death among institutionalized developmentally disabled\npopulations.  Our experts personally observed residents coughing\nand choking on food and mucus during meals.  Aspiration pneumonia\naccounted for at least three of the seven pneumonia-related\nhospital admissions of Arlington residents in the period from\nJuly 1, 1990, to December 15, 1990.  One of the five recent\ndeaths of Arlington residents was caused by aspiration pneumonia.\nAfter two of our tours, our consultants requested that we\nimmediately convey to Arlington staff their concern that these\nconditions were life-threatening to residents.  We did so.\nHowever, despite the serious risks of aspiration, Arlington fails\nto ensure that residents are fed safely.\n3.  Arlington Residents Do Not Receive Adequate Training.\na.  Failure to Provide Training Required bv Youngbero.\nFollowing a careful review, our consultant psychologist\nconcluded that the lack of training programs for Arlington\nresidents results in injury and the unreasonable risk of injury\n(to self and others).  Instances of self-abuse were not uncommon;\nobserved attempts to intervene appropriately were rare.  Many\nresidents were observed to have unexplained cuts, bruises and\nscrapes.  Our expert concluded that the current practice of\nbehavior modification at Arlington fails to reduce aggressive and\nother maladaptive and inappropriate behaviors.  Moreover,\nArlington does not provide adequate psychological services- to\nchildren to prevent them from developing self-abusive behaviors.\nClearly, many of the injuries we observed may have been\npreventable had programs been implemented and if more trained\nstaff were available.\nAs a result of Arlington's continuing failure to design and\nimplement adequate training programs, residents suffer otherwise\npreventable physical injuries, either self-inflicted or from\nother residents.  Approximately 40% of the injuries in a\nrepresentative sampling of Arlington residents were reported as\neither self-inflicted or caused by other residents.  Reducing\naggressive and other maladaptive and inappropriate behaviors\nthrough appropriate behavior modification and training would\nsignificantly reduce such injuries.\nOur consultants found that, although the great majority of\nArlington's residents are diagnosed as severely or profoundly\nmentally retarded, many are misdiagnosed.  Arlington does not\nhave adequate diagnostic criteria to determine degrees of\n\n- 9 -\nability.  As a result of inaccurate diagnoses, the meager\ntraining provided these residents is inappropriate.\nOur investigation also revealed that there -are many severely\nphysically .handicapped residents vho are misdiagnosed as severely\nor profoundly mentally handicapped because of their physical\nlimitations.  As a result of such misdiagnoses, residents do not\nreceive programming that qualified professionals would consider\nnecessary.  For example, many such residents are not provided the\nmeans to communicate through communication boards or other\nassistive communication devices even though they are capable of\nlearning such skills that would enable them to communicate their\nneeds, including their needs for specific care or treatment.  The\nfailure to provide residents with means to express their needs\nresults in harm and possible injury.\nOur experts found that most of the training plans and\nbehavioral programs do not address the individual needs of the\nresidents and often contained inappropriate or incompatible\ngoals.  Our expert found identical plans and programs for\nresidents who appeared to be functioning at different levels;\nadditionally, the programs were unchanged from one year to the\nnext.  The lack of individualized programs and the failure to\nrevise and update such programs represent a substantial departure\nfrom accepted professional practice.\nArlington residents do not have access to adequate and\nnecessary programs, i.e.. work-related, age appropriate fine and\ngross motor activities, to maintain their current level of\nfunctioning.  Our consultant found that the dearth of such\nprograms harms residents in two ways.  First, because they are\nnot provided with appropriate stimulation,\" residents may resort\nto self-abusive or other maladaptive behaviors.  Second, in the\nabsence of such programs, deterioration of physical and mental\nfunctioning is likely.  As a result of this deficiency, residents\nof Arlington are at a substantial risk of harm.\nWe additionally found that behavioral records are not\nmaintained and progress data is not collected in a consistent\nfashion and is not reliable.  Inaccurate or incomplete behavioral\ndata collection and recordkeeping present an active danger to\nresidents by depriving professional and other staff of\ninformation necessary to make professional, appropriate, and safe\ndecisions regarding training.\nb.  Inadequate numbers of and insufficiently trained staff\nto permit the training required by Younaberg.\nOur experts concluded that the three full time and two part\ntime (3.5 FTE) psychologists at Arlington —  the persons who are\nresponsible for the design, implementation, supervision, and\nevaluation of training programs to ensure resident safety and\n\n-10-\nfreedom from undue restraint ~  are clearly inadequate to render\nprofessional judgments with respect to the care and training of\nArlington residents.  Each of these psychologists has a caseload\nof approximately 140 residents.  -Our consultant found that a\ncaseload of this size is clearly too large to provide adequate\ntreatment for Arlington residents who require psychological\nservices.  Moreover, there are no doctoral level psychologists on\nstaff to supervise other staff functioning as psychologists.  An\ninadequate number of trained psychologists has resulted in a\nfailure to develop consistent and necessary treatment and\ntraining programs, to implement and monitor them, and to collect\nand record accurate and pertinent progress data.  As a result,\nresidents are at substantial risk of harm.\nThe safety of Arlington's residents is endangered by\ninadequate numbers of insufficiently trained direct care staff.\nOur investigation found that a majority of day and evening\nshifts, shifts that are scheduled to have a 1:4 staff to resident\nratio, in reality function with a ratio of 8 or more residents\nfor each direct care\" staff.  As a consequence of direct care\nstaff shortages, we observed a widespread failure to\nappropriately manage maladaptive behavior.  In one unit, our\nconsultant observed four residents engaging in self-injurious\nbehavior.  No staff members intervened.  In another unit, a woman\nrepeatedly banged her face against her arm brace.  Once again, no\nstaff intervened.\nThe direct care staff does not possess the technical\ncompetence to adequately supervise and train residents of\nArlington.  In addition, they were generally unfamiliar with\nresidents' behavior programs.  Training given to the staff is\ninsufficient in depth and scope to enable them to adequately and\neffectively provide essential care to residents.  As a result of\ninadequate numbers of inadequately trained direct care staff,\nresidents fail to receive adequate daily supervision and\ntraining.  This failure contributes to an alarmingly high\nfrequency of injuries, 20% of which are of unknown cause.  As a\nconsequence of the foregoing, residents of Arlington are exposed\nto serious risks to their health and safety.\n4.  Arlington School-Aged Residents Are Not Provided A Free\nAppropriate Public Education As Required By The Education Of\nThe Handicapped Act.\nOne hundred and sixteen school-aged children reside at\nArlington.  We have concluded that they are not being provided a\nfree appropriate public education required under the Education of\nthe Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. §1400 e£ seg.  (EHA).\nSpecifically, none of these children attend school off the\ngrounds, although a public elementary school is located a very\nshort distance from the facility.  Arlington has two educational\nprograms for the children who live at the facility,  one group is\n\n-11-\nsent to a building on the grounds where they attend classes; the\nother, consisting of more medically fragile children, attends\nclasses in the residences.  The classroom building has been\nclosed for asbestos removal «ince August 1990 and had not\nreopened at the time of our latest tour in December 1990.\nTherefore, all children have attended classes in their residences\nthus far in this school year.  Under the EHA, handicapped\nchildren are required to be provided a free appropriate public\neducation with non-handicapped children whenever possible.  This\nrequirement is clearly being violated.  Moreover, our review of\nresidents' Individual Education Programs confirms that the number\nof hours residents attend classes as well as the length of the\nschool year does not Beet the EHA's standards.\n5.  Arlington Residents Are Not Provided A Safe Environment.\nOur consultant found a number of serious fire safety hazards\nat Arlington.  He identified a major fire safety hazard in the\nBaker Building, the building that houses both the Infirmary and\nArlington's most physically involved residents.  All fire exits\nlead to a confined passageway that does not have appropriate\nprotections to permit the residents, many of whom are confined to\nwheelchairs or carts, the time to exit safely in case of a fire.\nOur investigation revealed that the majority of Arlington's\nresidential units do not meet the level of safety required by\nprofessional standards due to structural deficiencies (for\nexample, inadequate partitions), doors that are not fire\nresistent, failure to provide necessary smoke detectors or\nsprinklers, or inappropriate storage of combustible materials.\nAs a consequence, residents of Arlington are exposed to serious\nrisks to their health and safety.\nMinimally Necessary Remedies  v\nBased upon the circumstances discussed above, we have\nconcluded that Arlington residents are being subjected to\negregious or flagrant conditions that deprive them of their\nconstitutional rights pursuant to a pattern and practice of\nresistance to the full enjoyment of those rights.  In order to\neliminate the conditions that cause these deprivations, at a\nminimum, Arlington must implement the following remedies:\n1)  The State must not abuse or neglect Arlington residents\nand must establish a system to assure that allegations\nof abuse and neglect are investigated thoroughly and\nthat appropriate action, commensurate with the nature of\nthe offense, is taken against anyone who inflicts,\ncondones, or fails to report abuse or neglect.\n\n-.12-\n2)  The State must provide adequate medical care to\nArlington residents, including identification,\ntreatment, and management of their acute and chronic\nmedical conditions.\n3)  The State must provide professionally designed feeding\nprograms for the residents at Arlington who need them,\nand assure that such programs are appropriately\nimplemented by trained staff in order to protect\nresidents from risks of harm, particularly from\naspiration pneumonia.\n4)  The State must identify all residents who need physical\ntherapy and must provide professionally designed\nphysical therapy programs appropriately implemented by\ntrained staff.  The State must ensure that adaptive\nequipment provided to physically handicapped residents\nis individualized and appropriate and that a qualified\nprofessional oversees its design, use, and repair.\n5)  The State must provide professionally designed training\nprograms to the residents at Arlington who need them and\nfor whom training will reduce or eliminate unreasonable\nrisks to their personal safety and/or the need to use\nundue bodily and chemical restraints, and must ensure\nthat such programs are implemented by trained staff.\nImmediate attention must be given to residents with'\nself-injurious, physically abusive and other destructive\nbehaviors by identifying them and providing necessary\ntraining on a priority basis.\n6)  The State must hire, deploy, and provide ongoing .\ntraining to a sufficient number of competent and\nqualified direct care and professional staff to provide\nresidents at Arlington with adequate medical treatment,\nphysical therapy, physical management and positioning,\nand training programs.  Particular attention should be\ngiven to ensuring that professional staff receive\ncontinuing medical education so that they are equipped\nto provide adequate long-term care for medical problems\ncommonly found in residents living in facilities for the\nmentally retarded.\n7)  The State must hire or contract for the services of\nsufficient physicians to provide residents with adequate\nmedical and psychiatric services.\n8)  The State must assure that school-aged children receive\na free appropriate public education, including\nmainstreaming for those children who are capable of\nattending school off grounds.  Children who attend\n\n&;\n-13-\nschool at Arlington must be provided a professionally\ndesigned individualized education program suited to\ntheir needs, and one that provides each student with an\nappropriate length of school day and school year.\n9)  The State must remove fire hazards and make appropriate\nrenovations to protect the safety of Arlington\nresidents.\n10)  The State must assure that Arlington develops and\nimplements recordkeeping systems to monitor the use and\neffectiveness of behavior and other programs and\ntraining, and the use of medications, and ensure\nperiodic re-evaluations of such use.  —\nTo rectify the deficiencies at Arlington and to ensure that\nconstitutionally adequate conditions are maintained thereafter,\nwe propose to negotiate an agreement with the State of Tennessee,\nto be entered as an order of a federal court, which 6hall\nprovide, at a minimum, that the above referenced remedies will be\nimplemented at Arlington.\nInformation about Federal financial assistance which may be\navailable to assist with the remedial process can be obtained\nthrough the United States Department of Health and Human\nServices' Regional Office (Director, Intergovernmental and\nCongressional Affairs), and through appropriate officials of the\nUnited States Department of Education.\nOur attorneys will be contacting legal counsel for the\nTennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation\nshortly to arrange a meeting to discuss this matter in greater\ndetail.  In the meantime, should you or your staff have any\nquestions regarding this matter, please feel free to call\nArthur E. Peabody, Jr., Chief, Special Litigation Section, at\n(202) 514-6255.  To date, we have been able to conduct this\ninvestigation in the spirit of cooperation intended by the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act, and look forward to\ncontinuing to work in the same manner with State officials toward\nan amicable resolution of this matter.\nSincerely,\nJohn R.

For each incident, confer\nwith a resident's staff psychologist to determine if\nmodifications of Individual BTPs or additional staff training\ncould reduce serious injuries or abuse of the resident.  If\nfurther staff training is indicated, notify the Assistant\nSuperintendent for Residential Services.\n5.  Review staff psychologists' reports of problems with\nother staff member's implementation of the BTP and data\ncollection and discuss these with the appropriate Program\nDirector.  If these problems are not resolved within one month,\nreport them and the lack of their resolution to the Assistant\nSuperintendent for Residential Services.\n6.  Notify the Superintendent in writing of any problems\nthat limit the effectiveness of Individual BTPs, including\n-11-\n\nproblems related to cooperation, implementation, and both staff\nand material resources.\nL.  The Behavior Management Committee  (BMC), including a\nprimary care physician, shall meet to review those aspects of\neach resident's training program relating to the resident's\nmaladaptive behavior(s) and relevant progress notes for each\nresident:\n1.  who exhibits self-injurious behavior or causes injury to\nself or others through aggressive behavior and whose training\nprogram includes bodily restraint or psychotropic medication, or\n2.  for whom bodily restraint procedures are utilized three\nor more times within any six-month period, or who receives\npsychotropic modifying medication.\nM.  Where a resident suffers a serious or significant self-\ninflicted injury or inflicts a serious or significant injury on\nanother resident, the psychologist assigned to the resident shall\nconduct an immediate review of such behavior(s) and report the\nresults of such review to the BMC.  In all reviews conducted by\nthe BMC pursuant to this paragraph, the BMC shall ascertain\nwhether  (a) there is sufficient behavioral data recorded, (b)\nsuch data are reliable, and (c) the continuation of the current\ntraining or treatment program is justified, or the program,\nincluding medication, should be modified.  Where inadequate or\nunreliable data are found, or the continuation of the training or\ntreatment program is otherwise not justified, the matter shall be\nreferred to the appropriate IDT which shall, within 30 days from\n-12-\n\nthe referral, modify the existing training program in accordance\nwith the judgment of qualified professionals, including the\nprimary care physician, psychologist and psychiatrist, as\nappropriate.  The BMC shall meet at least every three months\nduring the first year of this Order and at least semi-annually\nthereafter.  The BMC and ADC's Human Rights Committee (HRC) shall\nbe reconstituted in a manner sufficient to meet the requirements\nof this Order.\nIV.  RESTRAINT\nDefendants shall ensure that unnecessary or inappropriate\nrestraints are not used at ADC.  To this end, and at a minimum:\nA.  Every behavior program that utilizes restraint or time\nout must specify:\n1.  the behavior that initiates the use of the restraint or\ntime out;\n2.  behaviors to be taught to the resident to replace the\nbehavior that initiates the use of the restraint or time out or\nother program to reduce or eliminate the use of the bodily\nrestraint or time out;\n3.  the restriction, i.e.. restraint or time out authorized,\nincluding the restriction's duration;\n4.  the professional responsible for the program and the\ndirect care workers authorized to implement it; and,\n5.  the frequency with which behavioral data is to be\nrecorded by direct care workers.\n-13-\n\nB.  Defendants shall, in order for a restrictive procedure\nto be included in a behavior treatment program, document in the\nresident's record that other, less restrictive techniques were\nsystematically employed as part of a professionally designed\ntraining program and were ineffective.\nC.  Defendants shall document each time restraints or time\nout is used and the length of time for each use.  The BMC shall\nconduct a monthly review of each use of restraint and each use of\ntime out.  The Human Rights Committee shall also review restraint\nusage on a regular basis.  Each committee shall make\nrecommendations with respect to the appropriateness of the use\nand continued use of the restraint, which recommendation shall be\npromptly implemented.\nV.  PSYCHIATRY AND THE USE OF DRUGS\nDefendants shall provide adequate and appropriate\npsychiatric and mental health services to residents who need such\nservices and ensure that the use of psychotropic drugs is\nappropriate.  Medication shall not be administered as punishment,\nin lieu of a training program, or for the convenience of staff.\nTo this end, Defendants shall, at a minimum:\nA.  Appropriately prescribe and administer medications for\nresidents.\n-14-\n\nB.  Initiate and implement a system which requires that\nevery behavior program that utilizes psychotropic1 medication\nspecifies:\n(1) the behavior that initiates the use of the psychotropic\nmedication; and\n(2) the behaviors to be taught to the resident to replace\nthe behavior that initiates the use of the medication or other\nprogram to reduce or eliminate the use of the medication.\nC.  Document that, prior to using the psychotropic\nmedication, other, less restrictive techniques have been\nsystematically tried as part of a training program and have been\ndemonstrated to be ineffective.  Such documentation in the\nresident's record must include reliable behavioral data collected\non the resident.\nD.

Toward this end,\nDefendants will ensure that the following actions are taken:\n1.  The consulting neurologist(s) retained by ADC will\ncomplete the process of examining and evaluating all residents\nwho receive anticonvulsant medication to assure correctness of\ndiagnosis and efficacy of treatment.  Thereafter, the frequency\nof follow-up will be determined by the medical judgment of the\nconsulting neurologist(s).  Residents receiving two or more\nanticonvulsant medications, or residents who have had five or\nmore seizures in the preceding 12-month period will be examined\nby a consulting neurologist at least annually.\n2.  ADC primary care physicians will refer residents for\nneurology consults when appropriate.  The results of the\nconsultant's findings and recommendations will be maintained in\nthe resident's medical record.  The primary care physician must\nreview and respond to all recommendations by the neurology\n-21-\n\nconsultant.  If the primary care physician determines that the\nconsultant's recommendation will not be followed, valid clinical\njustification for that determination must be documented in the\nresident's medical record.\n3.  Anticonvulsant medication levels will be used to guide\ntherapy, in conjunction with clinical judgment.  Levels will be\nmonitored at professionally appropriate time intervals during\ninitiation or change in therapy.  Once a therapeutic dose is\nestablished, anticonvulsant medication levels will be routinely\nmonitored at least every six months.  Levels will be monitored at\nother times as clinically indicated.  Therapeutic drug monitoring\nand physician follow-up of anticonvulsant medication blood levels\nwill be monitored by a quality assurance process.\n4.  If a resident is to be maintained on sub-therapeutic or\npotentially toxic levels of anticonvulsant medication, that\ntherapy will be in consultation with a neurologist and\njustification will be documented in the resident's record.  A\nreview by the consulting neurologist(s) of residents in these\ncategories will be performed and the frequency of follow-up will\nbe determined by the consulting neurologist.\n5.  In the process of attempting to achieve monotherapy, if\nthe resident suffers an increase in the number of seizures\ndespite adequate blood levels of the primary anticonvulsant\nmedication, referral to the consulting neurologist(s) will be\nmade.\n-22-\n\n6. Residents who have been seizure free for two years or\nmore will be assessed, in consultation with a neurologist, as to\nthe appropriateness of medication withdrawal.  The decision as to\nI\nthe appropriateness of medication withdrawal, as well as any\nwithdrawal plan, will be documented in the resident's medical\nrecord.\n7.  ADC will immediately cease administering medications by\nthe intra-muscular  (IM) route for residents in status\nepilepticus.  Residents in status epilepticus s.hall be\nimmediately transported by ambulance to emergency care at an\nacute care hospital.  Anticonvulsant medications will be\nadministered to residents in status epilepticus via intra-venous\n(IV) or rectal routes only.  Residents who are potentially at\nrisk for status epilepticus or to periodic prolonged series of\nseizures will be identified, and a plan developed by the primary\ncare physician and neurologist which sets out planned or\nrecommended treatment for that individual if status or a series\nof seizures occur.\n8.

RECORDKEEPING\nDefendants shall maintain records and record keeping systems\nadequate and appropriate to effectuate the terms of this Order.\nXIII.  RESIDENT PROPERTY\nADC will ensure residents' rights to own, keep and\nreasonably use personal possessions and property.\nXIV.  ADMISSION AND PLACEMENTS\nA.  Defendants shall reduce the population of ADC to 200\npersons or fewer by September 30, 1997.\nB.  Defendants will ensure that residents are placed in an\nappropriate and safe manner and that placements in the community\nare adequate to meet the needs of the individuals there placed.\nIn order to effectuate this requirement, the Defendants will, at\na minimum, comply with the following:\n1.  Defendants are enjoined from admitting any additional\nresidents to ADC except for emergency, short-term court-ordered\nadmissions.\n2.  All ADC residents who were age 21 or under as of January\n21, 1992, shall be placed in an appropriate community residence\nby no later than September 30, 1997.  Defendants will exert their\n-42-\n\nbest efforts and give priority to community placement of 75% of-\nthese individuals by September 30, 1996.\n3.  The nature of an individual's disability will not be a\nfactor in the eligibility of that individual for placement\nconsideration.\n4.  Defendants shall evaluate and develop an individualized\nplacement plan (IPP) for each ADC resident who will be placed to\nensure placement in appropriate, professionally developed,\ncommunity-based programs which fully meet his or her\nindividualized needs.\n5.  No ADC resident will be placed in a nursing home or\nother non-community placement, such as other state or private\ninstitutions.\n6.  Each IPP shall specify in detail the number and kind of\nprograms and facilities needed, including residential, day\nprograms, and specialized medical services, to serve the\nindividual resident in the community.  All services shall be\nintegrated into the community to the maximum extent possible.\nTransition services, including home visits and overnights, as\nwell as any other steps that need to be taken to ensure an\norderly and smooth transition for the resident, must also be\nincluded in the IPP.  Training for community facility staff must\ninclude meetings at ADC with staff familiar with the resident to\nbe transferred prior to the actual placement.\nFor school-age children, the IPP shall also include a\nstatement of the educational program, including related services\n-43-\n\nand transportation services, to be provided each child.  No child\nshall be placed in any setting that is not fully capable of\nproviding the educational services required by the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1485.  All\nplacements of children in residential settings must also comply\nwith all applicable Tennessee state laws with regard to special\neducational services to handicapped children.\n7.  Defendants shall ensure that the community placement for\neach and every ADC resident meets the individual needs of the\nresident, as identified in the IPP.  Under no circumstances will\nthe speed or type of a placement be governed by anything other\nthan the interests of the resident being placed.  In order to\naccomplish this, the Defendants may use existing community\nplacements only where they have certified that the placement\nmeets the needs of the resident as identified in the IPP.  Where\nthere are no existing placements to meet the resident's needs,\nDefendants shall create or contract for a community placement\nthat meets the needs of the resident as identified in the IPP.\nDefendants shall similarly certify that the new placement shall\nmeet the needs of the resident as identified in the IPP.\n8.  The IPP and the placement certification for each\nresident will be filed with the Monitor 60 days before each\nplacement is to occur.  The Monitor shall review each IPP and\nplacement certification to determine the adequacy of the\nplacement.  In situations where the Monitor determines the\n-44-\n\nplacement is not adequate, no placement shall occur until the\nissue is resolved.\n9.  Defendants shall afford residents, parents and guardians\nan opportunity to participate in the placement process.\n10.  Defendants shall ensure that each resident placed in a\ncommunity-based program pursuant to this Order has an advocate\nselected by a process developed by Defendants.\n11.  Community placements shall be required to provide a\nsafe and humane environment in which individuals are provided\ndaily opportunities to learn, develop and maintain skills.  All\nservices, including medical and other health related services\n(e.g.. physical therapy, occupational therapy, dental, speech and\nhearing, nutrition), and psychology, must be adequate and\nappropriate to meet the individual needs of the residents.\n12.  Defendants shall develop a case management system\nsufficient to ensure that the needs of each resident placed in a\ncommunity-based program pursuant to this Order are consistently\nreviewed and met.  Every resident will have a case manager.  No\ncase manager shall have a case load in excess of 3 0\ndevelopmentally disabled persons.  Case managers will be\nsupervised by and report to a designated staff person of DMHMR\nand will receive a minimum of eighty hours training in the\nrequirements identified in Paragraph P in addition to other job-\nrelated training.\nCase managers will be in regular, frequent contact with the\npeople on their caseload in both their residential and day\n-45-\n\nprogram or work site.  Case managers will observe participation\nin programs and therapeutic interventions and will evaluate the\ndegree to which services in the individualized plan are being\ndelivered.  In no event will case managers visit each of their\nassigned residents less than once every two weeks.\n13.  Defendants shall survey all community-based programs\nand facilities operated or supported by state funds in which\nformer ADC residents placed pursuant this Order reside at least\nannually to determine compliance with requirements referenced in\nParagraph P herein.  Reviews of the medical, psychological and\npsychiatric services available to these former ADC residents also\nmust occur on an annual basis by experts chosen by the Monitor in\neach area being reviewed.  Defendants shall ensure that all\ndeficiencies found in community placements are remedied promptly.\nDefendants shall address continuing deficiencies in community\nplacements by sanctions against the providers.\n14.  Investigations of all abuse or neglect allegations in\ncommunity placements or programs in which residents covered by\nthis Order reside must be done by trained investigators who\nreport directly to the Assistant Commissioner of DMHMR.\n15.  Reports for each residence or program surveyed by\nDefendants pursuant to this Order shall be forwarded to the\nMonitor within 30 days of the site visit component of the survey.\n16.  All community-based programs and facilities covered by\nthis Order shall meet state and local licensure requirements,\nDMHMR regulations and applicable fire safety codes.  Defendants\n-46-\n\nmust also ensure that all such community-based programs meet the\nrequirements of Defendants1 waiver plan and Defendants' current\nQuality Assurance Guidelines for Community Mental Retardation\nServices.\n17.  All residents being placed from ADC automatically shall\nbe deemed eligible for a waiver for a period of time not less\nthan five years.\n18.  Defendants shall provide sufficient funding to fulfill\nthe requirements in this agreement.\n19.  The Monitor is permitted unrestricted access to the\ncommunity placements of former ADC residents placed pursuant to\nthis Order and documentation regarding such placements for so\nlong as the Court retains jurisdiction in U.S. v. Tennessee.  The\nUnited States may have access to documentation regarding such\nplacements upon request and access to the community placements of\nformer ADC residents when issues regarding compliance with this\nOrder are raised by the Monitor.\nDeficiencies identified by either the monitor or the United\nStates in community placements must be addressed by Defendants\nimmediately in accordance with Paragraph M.\nXV.

Tennessee\n•  ^  W  MH  VH  HV  ••\nMR-TN-003-009\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT c I E1.' r.\nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE\nWESTERN DIVISION\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nv. No.  92-2062 Ml/A\nSTATE OF TENNESSEE, et al..\nDefendants.\nORDER ON CONTEMPT PETITION\nThis matter came on for a hearing on Friday, July 29, 1994,\non plaintiff's Motion for a Contempt Order or for an Order to\nShow Cause, filed June 29, 1994.  Following the hearing the Court\nreserved ruling pending a final determination on the remedy to be\nimposed in this case.  A Remedial Order having been entered by\nconsent of the parties on September 6, 1994, the court now issues\nthis order on the contempt petition.\nA preliminary injunction was entered in this case on\nNovember 22, 1993, in conjunction with the Court's oral ruling\nthat conditions at Arlington Development Center were inconsistent\nwith the mandate contained in Youngberg v. Romeo. 102 S.Ct. 2452\n(1982).  See Supplemental Findings of Fact and Addendum, docketed\nFebruary 18, 1994.  In its Order of November 22nd, this Court\nspecifically found that:\n'this  document  e\n79  (a)  FilC?  on.\n\n[In] the medical care area, and in the area of direct care\nsupervision of residents, conditions at Arlington\nDevelopment Center pose an immediate danger of irreparable\nharm, including an immediate risk of death to residents of\nArlington Development Center.  Medical care within the\ninstitution, particularly for patients with seizure\ndisorders, is so deviant from any recognized principles of\nmedical care that any patient suffering prolonged seizures\n(status epilepticus) may be in immediate peril of his/her\nlife.  The testimony is virtually uncontradicted that no\nstandard of care recognizes the administration of\nintramuscular valium for status epilepticus and that the\nonly appropriate treatment for status epilepticus involving\nuse of valium is IV valium.  Similarly, the failure of\ndirect care staff to directly supervise individuals with\nknown behavior disorders, including eating disorders, has\nresulted in deaths which were entirely preventable.\nPreliminary Injunction, 1 n.l.\nIn order to provide immediate relief concerning these\nconditions, this Court issued a Preliminary Injunction:\n1.  Defendants- shall immediately act to properly supervise\nresidents with known severe behavioral disorders, including\neating disorders which may result in life threatening\nconditions.  Arlington Development Center shall protect\nthose individuals from harm and shall assign additional\nstaff, specially trained, to supervise the care of those\nresidents with the most severe self injurious or life\nthreatening behavior disorders.\n2.  Arlington Development Center shall conduct immediate in-\nservice training of all physicians and nursing personnel\nregarding the proper diagnosis and treatment of seizure\ndisorders and shall staff all facilities on a 24-hour basis\nwith health care providers (either physicians or nurses) who\nhave been so trained.\nId. at 3-4.\n.  Plaintiff asserts that defendants took few meaningful\nactions to comply with the Court's injunction.  More\n- 2 -\n\nspecifically, plaintiff contends: (1) that defendants have failed\nto properly supervise and protect individuals at Arlington\nDevelopmental Center who have known severe behavior disorders,\nand have failed to train medical personnel to properly diagnose\nand treat seizure disorders; (2) that medical staff continue to\nallow residents to suffer status epilepticus for an hour and\nmore, prescribing only intramuscular medication and fail to\ntransport residents to the hospital; (3) that defendants continue\nto interfere with the United States' access to staff and to\ninformation about ADC by refusing to produce records and by\npermitting staff to falsify documents and be untruthful in\ninterviews;, and (4) that defendants refuse to take any actions to\nremedy the conditions at ADC until this Court issues a final\norder.\nIn response to the Contempt motion filed by defendants, the\nCourt issued orders requiring Dr. Cox, the Director of\nPsychology; Dr. McLemore, a physician and formerly Medical\nDirector; Dr. Mohyuddin, a physician at ADC; and Dr. Herring, a\nphysician at ADC, to appear and show cause why they should not be\nheld in contempt of Court for violation of the Contempt Order.\nThe evidence submitted at the contempt hearing, including\nnumerous documents and the credible testimony of Dr. Hyman,\noverwhelmingly demonstrated that defendants failed to properly\n- 3 -\n\ntreat residents with seizure disorders.  Based on the record\nbefore the Court, the medical staff allowed residents to suffer\nstatus epilepticus for an hour, or more, and treated them with\nintramuscular medication.\"1  This response to seizure management\nis contrary to minimum accepted standards of practice and in\ndirect violation of the Contempt Order previously issued by this\nCourt.  Further, the record clearly reflects that defendants have\nfailed to train all physicians and nursed in the proper diagnosis\nand treatment of seizure disorders and have failed to ensure that\nall facilities are staffed with such properly trained\nprofessionals.\nMoreover, the evidence before the Court, including the\ncredible testimony of Dr. Christian, shows that defendants have\nm  For example, the record  indicates that on February 22, 1994, resident\nLeandro P. had three prolonged seizures: one for 20 minutes, one for at\nleast an hour and 35 minutes, and the third one lasted for at least one\nhour.  Resident Leandro P. was found by a Developmental Technician (\"DT\")\nin his second seizure, foaming at the mouth with labored breathing and a\ntemperature  of  103.4 degrees  Fahrenheit.  According  to the  physician\nnotes. Dr. HcLemore, the attending physician, did not take any action\nuntil 45 minutes after the seizure was first noticed by the DT.  By this\ntime the resident was in status epilepticus.  Dr. McLemore did not examine\nthe  patient,  but  gave  an  order  for  IM  Ativan  over  the  phone.  The\nmedication  was  not  given  for  another  25 minutes  following  the  phone\nmedication  order. No  effort  was  made  to  administer  IV medication  or\ntransfer  the  resident  to  the  hospital,  even  though  minimum  accepted\nstandard practice would have dictated such a response.  (The nursing note\nindicates that the visible seizure signs stopped 25 minutes after the IM\nmedication was given, which was one hour and 35 minutes after the seizure\nwas noticed.)  As soon as the seizure appeared to be over, Dr. McLemore\ntook the resident to ADC's clinic for an EEC  Once there, the resident\nbegan seizing again.  Dr. McLemore's note at 4:30 p.m. states that Leandro\nP. was in status epilepticus and should be sent to the hospital.  He,\nhowever, did not leave for the hospital until 5:30 pm.  At this point in\nthe record, Dr. Herring, another physician, inserted a note indicating\nthat IV medication had been given at 5:20 p.m.\n- 4 -\n\nfailed to properly supervise and protect resident from harm.'21\nFurther still, the data collection at the facility is unreliable.\nThe data collection, necessary for accurate diagnosis and\ntreatment, under represents the rate and severity of behaviors,\n(see Christian, at 9(D), 9(E)), or has been falsified.\nPlaintiff has met its burden of proof, by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that defendants have violated this Court's\nPreliminary Injunction.  Accordingly, this Court finds that\ndefendants' conduct amounts to CONTEMPT OF COURT.\nIn plaintiff's petition for contempt, plaintiff requests\nthat the Court, inter alia, require defendants to commence\nimmediate training of medical staff on seizure management, retain\nan outside qualified consultant to train the staff on the needs\nof residents with severe behavior disorders, appoint Dr. Linda\nO'Neall as a monitor, reimburse plaintiff for the costs of the\ncontempt petition, and permit the United States to have access to\nADC.  In the Court's opinion most of these remedies have been\n121  For example, resident Leroy P. has pica behavior (eats inedible objects).\nHe has had so many- surgeries for bowel obstructions due to his pica, that\nanother obstruction could be life threatening.  On March 13, 1994, the\nresident had one-to-one staffing assigned to him when he ingested multiple\npaper towels and laundry string which resulted in his hospitalization on\nMarch  14, 1994.  In  the  month  of  February  1994, the  Consumer  Risk\nManagement Report indicates that he had nineteen pica incidents.  This\ninformation  came  from  staff  observing  his  emesis,  and  not  from  them\nobserving his  eating the objects.  Had  adequately  trained  staff  been\nappropriately monitoring Leroy P.,it would not have been possible for him\nto ingest this much material unobserved.\n-  5 -\n\nsufficiently addressed by the consent Remedial Order entered by\nthe Court on September 6, 1994.  This comprehensive order covers\nsuch concerns as abuse, psychology and habilitation services, use\nof restraints, psychiatric and mental health services, medical\ncare and services, physical and nutritional management, nursing\ncare, physical and occupational therapy services, educational\nservices pursuant to the IDEA, record keeping, resident property,\nadmissions and placements, as well as duties and privileges of\nthe Monitor.  See Remedial Order, entered Sept. 6, 1994.\nSince, at this time, the Remedial Order adequately addresses\nthe concerns raised in the contempt petition, the Court will not\nimpose any sanctions in addition to those outlined by the Court\nat the Contempt hearing.131 However, plaintiff's request for costs\nassociated with the filing of the petition is GRANTED.  Plaintiff\nshall submit, within thirty  (30) days of the entry of this Order,\nan itemized list of costs associated with the contempt petition\nand a proposed order granting the request.

These Orders were to be provided to the professional  staff by\nAugust 5, 1994.

However, i:he importance of this\n»\ncase and the necessity of being comfortable with those\ncomments that X intend to make to you today require that X\ntake eom© additional time.  I'm going to go through some\ncomments in this case and it will tak<i me a little time to\ndo that.  1 also want to make it clear and it will be clear\nfrom my written comments that the defendant in this case, of\n10 course, 1B the state of Tennessee.  I point that out because\n11 obviously, sometimes it is necessary Eor me to make comments\n12 which seem to be directed at individuals.  Now, that is\n13 because no institution, whether it is the state or the\nfederal government, can act through aiyone other than those\npeople who work for that entity.  But it is, of course, the\n16 State of Tennocsee that has the responsibilities in this\n17 case and it is as to tho State of Tennessee and as to the\nIB United States that 1 direct my commeennts.\ntJ;\n19 1 also point out that in this case, the rights of\n20 those individuals who are being litigated are the rights of\n21 individuals whose condition preclude. them often from making\n22 their own complaint.  Often they are individuals who, while\nthey enjoy all of the constitutional rights of every citizen\n23\nof this country, are because of physical or mental\n24\ndisability unable to articulate theix own claim.  While that\n\nFROM 11.01. 1995  15:29 P.  4\nt\n•t\ndoes not givo them special rights, it points out the problem\nthat each of UB must recognize, and that is that often it is\nthe circumstantial evidence which has great weight in these\ncases.  We arc generally unable to hear from those*\nindividuals who would in many cases * the ones to\narticulate the claim.\nLadies and gentlemen/ it is important that each of\n8 you recognizes that this is a court of law and a nation of\nlaws, that the settlement of disputes between people through\n10 a lawsuit is a ntrong and necessary foundation upon which\n11 our civilization rests.  It is proper under our system of\n12 justice when there is a dispute between parties regarding\n13 the application of the law that those parties resolve their\n14 case in court.  It is the responsibility of the federal\n15 district courts to hear those claims and specifically to\n16 hear those claims arising under the Constitution and laws of\nn the United States and to render a prcmpt decision regarding\nIB the application of the law to the facts as established by\n19 the record during the trial.\n20 In making that decision/ tle law requires that the\n21 Court not be influenced by sympathy, bias, prejudice or\n22 passion.  This is a case in which th<re has been much\n23 testimony, much testimony which might be very sympathetic\n24 for one side or the other, but the Ccurt must make its\ndecision not based on a sympathetic reaction, but on the\n25\n\n11.01.1995  15:30 P. 5\n4\nobjective facts as established on th* record.\nAdditionally, the Court mu t consider, of course,\nall of the applicable law and not a •ingle principle in\nreaching its conclusion.  The Court may not disregard a\nportion of the law and make its deci ion only on a single\nlaw, but must regard all of the law  ind each law in light of\nall of the other applicable laws.  Tie United States* in\naccordance with the authority granted by the Congress, under\nthe Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which is<\n10 sometimes referred to as CRIPA, is t10 plaintiff in this\n11 case.  While the United States appears as a frequent\n12 litigant in federal district courts, it is entitled to no\nspecial consideration and appears be ore the Court as any\n14 other litigant.\n15 The burdon placed on the Uttited States is no\n16 different from the burden placed on ther litigants before\n17 the Court in similar cases.  And if he United States fails\n18 to satisfy any portion of that burde , by the standard placed\n19 upon it by thn law, it cannot prevaijj on that claim or\n20 claims.\n21 in this case, the State of Tennessee and several\n22 individuals named in their official capacity as employees of\n23 the State of Tennessee are defendants in this case.  When a\n24 suit is brought against employees of a state or a county or\n25 other political subdivision in their official capacity/ the\n\n.FROM 11.01.1995  15:30 P. 6\ngovernmental entity with whom they are employed is, for all\npractical purposes, the actual party in the case.  The State\nof Tennessee/ merely because it is a Btate, is not entitled\nto special consideration in this case.  Just as the United\nStates, the State of Tennessee, as with every other\nlitigant, is entitled to no preferential treatment under the\nlaws in this case.\nAs I previously noted, the United States has\nbrought this case pursuant to the Civil Rights of\n10  institutionalized Persons Act and asserts that the State of\n11  Tennessee in its operation of the Arlington Development\ni\n12 I Center has failod to comply with those lavs protecting the\n13  civil rights of disabled individuals and has failed to\n14  provide to those individuals educational opportunities as\n15  required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education\n16  Act.  The United States more specifically claims that the\n17  defendants have failed'to provide adequate food, medical\n16  care, reasonable safety and training, freedom from\n19  unreasonable restraints and adequate psychological and\n20  psychiatric services as required under the Fourteenth\n21  Amendment of the United States Constitution and has failed\n22  to provide Arlington residents under the age of 22 with the\n23  educational services required by IDEA,\n24  The Btate of Tennessee, the governor of the State\n25  of Tennessee, the director of the Department of Mental\n\nFROM 11.81 . 1995  15:31 P.  7\nHealth and Mental Retardation and the superintendent of the\nArlington Development Center are the defendants in this\ncase.  All of the individuals named in this case, as I have\nindicated, arc named in their official capacities.\nThe dafondants contend that their operation of the\nArlington Development Center has not fallen so far below the\nstandard of acceptable care for individuals with mental\nretardation as to constitute a violation of those\nindividuals' civil rights.  The defendants further contend\n10  that the educational opportunities provided to the residents\n11  of Arlington Development Center below the age of 22 are in\n12  compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education\n13 Act.\n14  I will explain to you somewhat the procedure that\n15  the Court goes through in deciding a case of this nature or\n16  lor that matter, any case.  The Court in this case, and I\n17  refer to the Court, because it sounds funny to say me all\n18  the time, but I have to act as the Court in this case.  Mow,\n19  when a person acts as the Court or the judge, you no longer\n20  act as an individual.  Your individual beliefs or\n21  perceptions are not what govern your conduct, but rather the\n22  laws of the United states and the Constitution of the United\n23  States.  The Court also acts in the capacity as a\n24  fact-finder.  The Court has to decide what are the true\n25  facts in thin case.  So when I say the Court, I thinK it's\n\nPROM 1 1.ei. 1995  15S31 P.  8\nbest for you to understand that I'm not confused about who I\nam and who the Court is, but it is important for each of you\nto understand that the Court doesn't act like me.  The Court\nis, in fact, something that is more than just an individual\nspeaking.  The Court in this case is the judge of the facto\nconcerning the controversy in this lawsuit.\nThe trial of this case began on August the 30th/\n1993 with the testimony of Dr. Walter P. Christian, the\nfirst witness presented by the United States.  Sixteen\n10  additional witnesses testified live in the courtroom/ many\n11  oi whom or some o£ whom were seen by individual members here\n12  and all by the lawyers, and a large number of depositions or\n13  portions of depositions were placed in tho record.\n14  On September the 10th, 1993, the State of\n15  Tennessee presented its first witness, Mona Reeves-Winfrey,\n16  the superintendent of the Arlington Development Center.\n17  Seven' other witnesses testified for the state.  The case was\n18  then recessed from September the 17th, 1993 to October 18,\n19  1993, at which time the state resumed its proof with the\n20  testimony of Dr. Alexander Horwitc.  The state presented an\n21  additional 11 witnesses, including the testimony of Dr.\n22  Philip Robert Ziring.  The United States then presented\n23  three rebuttal witnesses by live testimony. Dr. Christian,\n24  Dr. Victoria Therriault, and Dr. Irene MeEwen, all of whom\n25  who had previously testified in the case and also presented\n\nFROM 11.01.1995  13:32 P.  9\n8\nby video deposition the testimony of Dr. Susan Hyman.  The\nparties were allowed to submit post-trial proposed findings\nof fact and post-trial memoranda.  And the united states\nsubmitted a proposed order'in this case.\nIt is now for the Court to determine what the true\nfacts are in this case and to apply the law to those facts.\nNow, in order for a fact-finder to determine what\nthe true facts arc, the fact-finder in called upon to weigh\nthe testimony of every witness who hau appeared before it or\nwhose testimony has boon submitted into evidence and to give\n10\n11 the testimony of the witnesses the weight, faith, credit and\n12 value to which the Court determines i'; is entitled.  In\n13 determining which testimony to believo and, where necessary,\nwhich testimony not to believe, the Court considers a number\n14\nIS of factors.  The factors that the Cou t has considered in\n16 determining the credibility or believability of each witness\n17 include the manner and demeanor of th i witness while on the\n18 witness stand, whether the witness im;pressed the Court as\n19 one who was telling the truth or one  /ho was telling a\n20 falsehood and whether or not the witniss was a frank\n21 witness.  The Court also considered t reasonableness or\n22 unreasonableness of the testimony of the witness, the\n23 opportunity or lock of opportunity.of the witness to know\n24 the facts about which he or she test!tied, the intelligence\n25 or lack of intelligence of the witness, the interest of the\n\n•FROM 11.81.1995  15:32 P. 10\nwitness in the result of the lawsuit, if any, the\nrelationship of the witness to any oi the parties to the\nlawsuit, if any, and whether the witress testified\ninoonsistently while on the witness eitand or if the wltneas\nsaid or did something or failed to day or do something at\nany other time that 1B inconsistent with what that witness\nsaid while testifying.\nLadies and gentlemen, if there lo a conflict in\nthe testimony of the witnesses, it ie the Court's duty to\n10 reconcile that conflict, if it can b$ reconciled, because\n11 the law presumes that every witness has attempted to and has\n12 testified to the truth.  .But if then? is a conflict in the\nk\n13 testimony of tho witnesses that the ourt is not able to\n14 reconcile, then the Court has to determine which ones of the\n15 witnesses to believe and which ones ;.t cannot be believe,\n16 that is which witnesses testified to a falsehood*\n17 of course, immaterial discrepancies do not affect\nX8 a witness' testimony, but material discrepancies do.\n19 It should be noted that th<» greater weight of the\n20 evidence in a case is not determined by the number of\n21 witnesses testifying to a particular fact or a particular\n22 state of facts, rather it depends on the weight, credit and\n23 value of the total evidence on either side of the issue.\n24 As I previously noted, the Court may also consider\n25 circumstantial evidence as well ae direct evidence in\n\n11.61.1995  15:33 P.11\n10\ndeciding a case and, obviously, the law permits the Court to\ngive equal weight to both direct and circumstantial\nevidence.  Of course, it is up to the Court to decide what\nweight to give any of it.\nIn this case, particularly for those of you who\nhave participated in this case and for those of you who have\nattended portions of it, there have been a large number of\nindividuals who are called expert witnesses.  You nay, if\nyou're not a lawyer, may not understand or know that the\n10 Rules of Evidence do not normally present ~  do not normally\n11 permit a pernon to testify as to opirions or conclusions.\n12 An exception to this rule exists for those who testify under\n13 the Rules of Evidence as an expert w:tness.\n14 An expert witness is a perron, who by education\n15 and experience, has become an expert in some art, science,\n16 profession or calling.  Expert witnesses are allowed to\nstate their opinions as to a relevant and material matter as\n18 to those things which are relevant axjxd material and, of\n19 course, as to those things as which i;hey profess to be\n20 expert and they way give their reasons for that opinion.\n21 In this case, the Court hau considered each expert\n22 opinion received as evidence in the case and has given to\n23 each expert's opinion that weight, il any, the Court thinks\n24 it deserves.  Where an expert opinio; is not based on\n25 sufficient education and experience or if the Court\n\n•FROM\n11.01.1995  15:33 P. 12\nconcludes that the reasons given in support of the opinion\nare not supported by the record or if the Court finds that\nthe opinion iB outwoighed by other evidence or is\nunsupported by the facts in the the Court may*\ndisregard an expert opinion, or at Xexst portions of that\nopinion.\nIn this case, there have bean three categories of\nindividuals supplying testimony.  Additionally, there have\nbeen over 440 exhibits.  Actually, many of those have not\n10 been paper exhibits, but there have been many, many\n11 exhibits, some of which are long documents, others of which\nJ.2 are videotapes.  These exhibits include records from\n13 Arlington Development Center*  They nclude videotapes of\n14 the facility and of practices at the facility.  They include\n15 photographs of patients and they inc ude charts and graphs\n16 containing summary information.\nV Now, the testimony has bee from three basic\n18 groups of people.  First, current an former employees of\n19 Arlington Development Center.  Secon< ly, parents and family\n20 members of individuals who are or we a residents at\nArlington Development Center and, th rd, experts and\n22 consultants retained either by the U ited States or the\n23 State of Tennessee in connection witi this case or in\n24 connection with contracts to provide services to Arlington\nDevelopment Center.\n25\n\n11.01.1995  15S34 P.\n12\ni\nAs is often the case, the documents generated at\ntho time of the occurrence of events Often provide some of\nthe most reliable information concerning the events in this\ncane,\nI vill talk a little bit more about some of those\ndocuments later.  However/ 1 have considered all of those\ndocuments in reaching my conclusions in this case.\nAdditionally, those individuals who are currently at\nArlington Development Center, or who have previously worked\n10 there are in a particularly good position to provide\n11 information regarding the ordinary practices and policies of\nthe institution.\n12\n13 Parents and family members jare in a position to\n14 provide some information, and their tjestimony has been\nappreciated and has been helpful.  Of course, the Court must\n16 recognize that individuals who have m|ade the choice to place\n17 their loved one In any institution have a strong desire for\n18 that institution to provide the best bossible care.\n19 Additionally, and understandably, generally, their view of\n20 the institution may be strongly affec*ed by whether they\n21 have a continuing interest in the institution as a care\n22 provider or whether they no longer have that interest.\n23 The testimony of experts, of course, is affected\n24 by the reliability of the information they receive on which\n25 they base their expert testimony.  It they receive\n\n1 1.01 . 1995 P. 14\ninaccurate or incomplete information/: then the testimony\nprovided by the expert nay be of limited or .little value,\nsimilarly, if thoir inquiry is a narrow inquiry as to a\nspecific aspect of the institution, their opinion may have\nlittle or no application to other parts of that institution\nFinally, if they can be demonstrated to have previous ~  to\nhave previously existing biases or prejudices or to have\n8 previously committed to a position without examination of\nthe facts at the institution/ their testimony may be\n10 severely impeached.  Before X proceed to tell you my\n11 assessment of the evidence, I also an going to review with\n12 you in some more detail what the United states must prove in\n13 order to meet its burden of proof on its claim that the\n14 state of Tennessee has violated the fourteenth Amendment\n15 rights of the residents at that institution.\n16 Again, in order for the plaintiff to establish a\n17 violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the plaintiff must\n18 show that tho defendants committed the acts alleged by the\n19 plaintiff, that those facts caused the residents of\n20 Arlington Development Center to suffer the loss of a federal\n21 right and that in performing the acts alleged/ the\n22 defendants' actions were a substantial departure from\n23 accepted professional judgment, practice or standards as to\n24 demonstrate that the perspn responsitle actually did not\n25 base a decision on such a judgment. A mere negligent act by\n\n« FROM 11.01.1995  15!35 P. 15\n14 i\nthe defendants causing harm does not constitute a violation\nof the Fourteenth Amendment even though those acts would\nconstitute malpractice.  Thus a mere lack of due care by the\nstate official does not deprive a resident of a\nconstitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nI now OIBO want to review with you more\nparticularly eomo of the language fron the United States\nSupreme Court in the case of Youngberg versus Romeo, which I\nbelieve eoto out the principles governing the Fourteenth\n10 Amendment claim in this case.\n11 In Youngberg, the Supreme Court specifically\n12 stated when a person is institutionalised and wholly\n13 dependent on the state, a duty to provide certain services\nand care dons exist, although even thBn a state necessarily\nhas considerable discretion in determining the nature and\n16 scope of its responsibilities.\n17 The Supreme Court in Youngberg went on to\n18 specifically raise the question of what is the proper\nstandard for determining whether a state adequately has\n19\n20 protected the rights of the mentally retarded.  The Court\n21 pointed out tho Constitution only requires that the courts\nmake certain that professional judgment, in fact, was\n22\nexercised.  It is not appropriate -for the courts to specify\nwhich of soveral professionally acceptable choices should\n24\nhave been made.  The.mentally retarded are entitled to more\n25\n•  i .\n\nFROM 11.01.1995  15:35 P. 16\n15\nconsiderate treatment, of course, and conditions of\nconfinement better than criminals who e conditions of\nconfinement are designed for punishment.\nObviously, the Supreme Court points that'out\nbecause wa have always recognised in he United States, or\nat least for a number of years, that ndividuale who are\nincarcerated involuntarily for the purpose of punishment\ngive up many rights.  So the court poLnts out in Youngberg\nthat individuals in institutions of tlie nature have rights\n10 nnd that those rights are different firom the righto of those\n11 people who are involuntarily incarcerated for purposes of\npunishment.\n13 In Youngbcrg, the Court als observed, the courts\n14 must show deference to the judgment ekeroised by qualified\n15 professionals.  By so limiting judiciil review of challenges\n16 to conditions in state institutions, Interference by the\n17 federal judiciary with the internal operations of these\n13 institutions should be minimized.\n19 The Court noted that the cojirts should not\n20 eecond-guoes the expert administrator on matters on which\n21 they are better informed.  The Court Lndicated that for\n22 those reasons, the decision, if made >y a professional, is\n23 presumed valid; liability may be imposed only when the\n24 decision by the professional is such substantial departure\n26 from accepted professional judgment, practice or standards\ni i\n\n11.81.1995  15:36 P.I?\n1 OB to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did\n2 not base the decision on euch a judgment.\nYoungherg reminds us that the state has a duty to\n4 provide adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care.\n5 These are essential to the care that jthe state —  these are\n6 essential oleraents of the care that the state must provide.\n7 The state also has an unquestioned duty to provide\ne\nreasonable safety for all residents and personnel within the\ninstitution.  Renidents enjoy constitutionally protected\n10 interests in the conditions of reasonable care and safety,\nn\nreasonable nonrestrictive confinement conditions and such\n12 training as may bo required by these interests.\n33 Ladies and gentlemen, it ie these principles that\ngovern tho determination made by the Court today*\nIn reviewing the evidence in this case, there is  !\nmuch testimony and documentation which appears to be\nreconcilable.  As a general proposition, it appears that\ni\neven the defense experts do not seribusly question that\n19\nconditions at Arlington Development Center in 1990 and 1991 '\n20\nfailed to comply with minimal requirements established under!\n21\nthe Fourteenth Amendment for individuals with mental\n22\nretardation.  In 1990 and 1991, key positions at the\n23\ninstitutions were unfilled.  Psychiatric and psychological\n21\ncervices worn virtually nonexistent,: Outside consultants\nwere rarely, if ever, used.  And sta£f lacked the training '',\n\nFROM\nU.  81 . 1995  15!  36\nP. 18\nor direction to properly feed, train, monitor and care for\nthis population.\nEven at the time of his teeimony on September 14,\n1993, Dr. Jon Scott bailey, a fellow > f the American\nPsychological Association and profess r at Florida fetate\nUniversity and a consultant for the S ate of Tennessee\nstated that he is now only beginning o Bee people who are\n0 starting to be sensitive to the needs of residents at\nArlington Development Center.  Dr. Baley appeared to  I\nio concede that data collection at Arlin ton Development Center !\nis really not quite good enough to develop behavior\nli\ndevelopment plane.  Dr. Bailey described the work of one of\n12\n13 his colleagues, Dr. Riordan as —  inone of the resident\ncottageB at Arlington Development Certer indicating that in\n14\nthe Spruce Unit, they are doing much better and that in\n15\nother areas they are not as good.  \\\n16\n.Dr. Bailey described the psychology staff as quotej\n17\n\"in transit11 and acknowledged that since December 1992, some\n18\nof them have quit and some have been added.  He also stated '\n19\nthat none of the masters level psychjlogists have a\n20\nbackground in behavior analysis. He also said we have asked1\n21\na lot of people to change the way they're doing things.\n22\nThey're getting more interested, more involved, morale is\nimproved a little bit on the two units we have been roost\n24\n25 involved in. Dr. Bailey acknowledged that he is not a\n\n11.01.1995  15:37 P. 19\n.FROM\nclinical psychologist and confirmed that he is -- that he\ndid not indopendently verify any of the data submitted by\nArlington Development Center for some of hie calculations.  •\nI should also note that Dr. Bailey submitted a\ndocument entitled Some Common Characteristics of Severely\nand Profoundly Retarded Persons, which was marked as Exhibit\n309, which on ciose examination of Dr. Bailey and on\nexplanation by other witnesses was thoroughly discredited.\nDr. Alexander V. Horwitz, a doctor of psychiatry\n10 and consultant lor Arlington Developnent Center had only, asj\n11 of the month of his testimony, recently been increased from I\n12 16 hours of consultation per month to 44 hours of  ;\n13 consultation per month at Arlington Development Center.  Dr. \\\n14 Horwitz, again, an expert for the defendants gave testimony ?\n15 contrary to the testimony of the director of psychology of  <\n16 Arlington Development Center, Dr. Beverly Cox.  Dr. Cox had\n17 given testimony to the effect that sone or many of Arlington j\n18 residents would prefer to be alone whareas Dr. Horwitz'B\n19 testimony was thnt nitting alone, not socialising is a\n20 behavioral problem.  Dr. Horwitz/ of :ourse, Is a trained\n21 psychiatrist, whoreas Dr. Cox has a Ph.D. in education and a j\n22 masters in guidance.  While Dr. Horwitz has been a  i\n23 consultant for Arlington Development Center for over one\n24 year, he acknowledged that he has never performed a data  ;\n25 collection chock and that he would be concerned if he found  .\n\n.FROM 11.01.1995  15:37 P. 20\nthat certain patients were not getting behavioral\nreinforcement.\nDr. Michael j. Levin©, a de elopment\n4  neuropeychiatrist in the State of Louisiana and medjLcal\ndirector for the Office of Citizens with Development\nDisabilities of the State of Louisiana also testified as an\nexpert for the state of Tennessee.  Dr. Levine, more bluntly\nthan Dr. Horwitz stated his candid opinion as the Court\nunderstood, that Dr. Cox, the director of psychology at j\n10  Arlington Development Center did not liave the level of!\n11  training required*  He went on to eta ;e the opinion that\n12  experts from out of state are fun to have, but you have to\n13  grow your own internal expertise.  Moreover, in hie initial\n14  deposition, Dr. Levine stated that Arlington Development\nis  Center did not meet common practice iiji neuropsychiatry and\n16  he stated that a good initial evaluation of five to seven'\n17  pages is essential and normal in Louisiana, but that he saw\n16  none of that at Arlington Development Center.  He was\n19  careful to say that he did not evaluate the quality and\n20  quantity of staffing at Arlington Development Center, but\n21  noted that he did find things missing.in records and found\n22  no particular pattern in charts.  He admitted that Arlington\n23  Development Center did not have data Collection under\n24  control.  Dr. Levine described going to Arlington\n25  Development Center's psychiatric program'as like going to\n.1\n\n•FROM 11.01.1995  15:38 P. 21\n20\nSamoa and asking where is your nuclear\nreactor.  He also\ncompared Arlington Development Centex\nwith the research\nprogram at the University of Califorria\n, LOB Angeles,\nindicating that it was like comparing\na Cadillac factory,\nthat is UCLA, to an ox cart factory.\nArlington Development\nCenter.  He stated that he did not se,e\ntraining taking place\nat mealtime, at the time he gave his\ndeposition, and he also\nconfirmed that he saw very little social\nskill program*\ndevelopment.  Dr. Levine criticized the\nway in which\nArlington Development's records are\n10 cjriented, indicating\n11 that they are problem-oriented records and that they should\n12 hove been service-oriented records.\n13 While the State of Tennessee's experts and\n14 consultants were very cautious in thcjlr testimony  regarding\n15 psychological and psychiatric service's, the experts\n16 presented by the United States were ^equivocal in their\n17 insistence that the services, processes, procedures,\nmedication and treatments provided ii this institution fall]\nIB\nfar below any acceptable standard as to constitute a failure!\n19\nto exercise professional judgment in their entirety.  i\n20\nDr. Walter Christian, a Ph.D. clinical  !\n21\n22 psychologist and president of the Ma)Institute in Chatham,\n23 Massachusetts, testified both in the United States initial\n24 presentation of proof and in rebuttal Dr. Christian\n25 visited Arlington Development Center on October the 14th and:\n\nFROM\n11.01.1995  15s38\nP.22\n15th,  1993.  You will recall that we had a break in the\ni\npresentation of the testimony and he v'isited it again having\npreviously gone several other times.\nHe visited the Arlington Development Center, as I\nindicated, on October the 14th and 15th, 1993 to determine\nwhether psychological services had improved since his\nprevious visitts to Arlington.. The vinit was a surprise\nvisit as authorized by the Court, and Dr. Christian found\nthat most patients were Idol and he saw more self-in jury,,\n10\nthan on any previous tour.  Because he  October visit was a\n11 surprise visit, ho concluded that the previous visits were\n12 staged for my benefit, in his words. He testified that\n13 conditions in his October visit were worse than the visit in\n14 July of 1991, his first visit to the facility.  He found\n15 that the staff was poorly trained, that there was no\n16 evidence that the staff was better trained, that the\ni\n17 staff-to-patient ratio remained inadequate and that the\n18 number of psychologists remain totally inadequate.  He found\n19 that tho Daniol Roono cottage which \\\\&d been the subject of\n20 work by Dr. Bailey, whom I have previously mentioned, was in\n21 October of 1993 in worse shape than riianyb ase line units and\n22 ho observed this —  he observed that this was after the\n23 consultants had essentially finished their work at Daniel\n24 Boon©.  Ho tostified that the problems with self-injury,\ninability of staff to react to situa:ions and inadequate or\n\n\"FROM 11.81.1995  15:39 P. 23\nno data collection were, according to Dr. Christian, still\nin existence during his October visit Dr. Christian even\ndescribed hie observations of a resid<nt -- in fact, he\ndescribed his observations of several residents, but he\ndescribed his observations of Candace T. who had previously\nbeen observed eelf-injuring herself ii order to obtain\n'!•;••'\nreinforcement with orange juice.  DurJng his visit in\noctobor, she was found sitting in a 1:ne of nonambulatory\npatients facing a wall.  It appeared 1hat no one was\n10 observing this gruup of residents and certainly that no one\nwas interacting with them.  Ultimatelyr, after waiting some\nperiod of time, he determined that those residents had\n12\n13 apparently been placed in line facing the wall so that a\nRtaff member could sit in an office a a desk and look out\n14\n15 the office door to see the patients or the residents lined\n*,<•(<\"•!\"  »'•'•\n16 up,\nDr. Christian found that th blue cards described\nat some length by Dennis Mozingo in h s testimony on behalf\n19 of the United States were in Dr. Chri tian's words just a\n20 bell and whistle which was not being properly used to record\n21 behavior.\nDr. Christian observed in Daniel Boone 3 at 9 a.m.1\n22\n23 >bill not had breakfast\n24 because of the new improved feeding program adopted by\n25 Arlington Development Center.\n\nF ROM\n11.01.1995  15:48\nP.24\n1 In reconciling the testimony of Dr. Christian, Dr.\n2 Bailey, Dr» Horwitz, Dr. Cox, Dr. 8zym*nski and others,\n3 there is no credible testimony that conditions have .\n4 substantially improved from the period of July, 1991, when\nS it is virtually conceded by the State af Tennessee that\n6 psychiatric and psychological services were virtually\n7 nonexistent,  while it is true that s ie limited progress\na may have been made in identifying and analyzing the problem,\n9 and in that regard, the Btate of Tennessee should be\n10 commended, the actual delivery of services to the vast\n11 majority of Arlington Development residents in need of them,\n12 nnd the development of a system to provide for the delivery,\n13 monitoring and sustaining of those services has yet to\n14 occur.\n15 The pattern demonstrated by the experiences of Dr.\n16 Bailey, Riordan, Mozingo and others, bther consultants\n17 consulting to provide improved care a: Arlington Development\n18 Center has been repeated in other are is as well.  Thus,\n19 while iinpjrovoidonts have been planned  ay Dr. William Hinkle\n20 and feeding programs and efforts to implement improvements\n21 hove been undortoken by Carla Lynn Andreas, the lack of any\n22 judgment in implementing that advice has resulted in a\n23 failure thus far of. the institution to meet any minimal\n24 standards.\n25 in a surprise visit authorized by the Court on\n\n•FROM\n11.01.1995  15:40 P.25\nI\n24\nOctober l and 2, 1993, Victoria Therriault observed the samej\nproblem as Dr. Christian concerning Icing delays in residents\nbeing allowed to oat.  i\nAdditionally, while there uuiy be some improvement\ni  •\nin the preparation of actual feeding ^lans, Nurso Therriault\ntestified that those individuals who were actually feeding\nresidents generally had not been trained on any feeding plan|\nat all or had specifically not been trained on the feeding <•\nplan for the resident they ware feeding.'\n10\nApparently, because it was a surprise visit and\n11\nnot a planned visit, Nurse Therriault: was also able; to\n12\nconsistently observe inadequate staffj-to-resident ratios and\n13\nfailure of staff to interact with residents.  She found as\n14\nmany as ten people in the Holly Unit who were completely\n15\nunsupervised, that is alond.  This is| significant fnd wan >\n16\nsignificant to Nurse Therriault because those individuals^,\n17\nhave been identified as individuals at high rlBk.  As she\n18\nhad observed in her earlier visits, in her October, visit/\n19\nshe also sow food trays which were given to tho wrong\n20\npatient - a particular problem since many patients require\n. j  •\nspeoialized diets and the consumption of the wrong; or*\n22\nwrongly textured food may result in immediate harm or even\n23\ndeath.  Nurse Therriault also saw, during her October, 1993,\n24\nvisit continued improper nursing can in connection with the\n25\nadministration of medication, the repositioning of a patieni\n\n•FROM 11.81.1995  IS:41 P.  26\nby a nurse in which the nurse actually pulled up o{Ta\nfractured arm, causing the patient tc cry out.  Once again/\nNurse Therriault was able to observe records in which no\nvital signs had been taken when appropriate and whtore\npatients with greater than therapeutic drug levels were\nexperiencing a complication which nurjsing personnel, should\nhave, but did not identify.\nWeighing all of the expert testimony in ihis case,\nincluding the testimony of individuals who were consultants\n10 or employees of Arlington Development Center, it if clear\n11 that the care actually provided to residents' at Arlington\n!\n12 Development center falls wej.1 below any minimum standard and\n13 well below the medical malpractice standard.\n14 It further appears and the Court finds that the\ncaro ot Arlington Development Center fails to meet the\nconstitutional tests which I told you about earlier as set\n17 out by the Supremo Court in Youngberg versus Romeo*\n18 A similar analysis, when applied to the testimony\nId concerning compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities\n20 Education Act, reveals that the requirements of that act are\n21 not being satisfied. •It is clear that in some are* »- it is\n22 clear that in this aroa, some progress may be being made and\n23 that the consultants in this area have perhaps had the most\n24 satisfactory effect.\nThe evidence from the State of Tennessee itself,\n25\n\n\"FROM II.61.1995  15:41 P. 27\nI\nhowever, reflects that the principal tithin the Arlington\nDevelopment Center has recently almos been .terminated and\nthat the bast teacher, and the teachejr who was shown in the\n:hing at Arlington\nDevelopment Conter has now left Arlington Development\nCenter,\nIt is clear from the testlm ny of the defendants'\n8 own export, Dr. Gene Alvin Vergason, ;•resident of vjergaeon\nAssociates, inc., that the individual education plans are of\n10 questionable adequacy under ~  in fac:, inadequate under the\n11 Act and that Arlington Development Coiter does not meet the\n12 standards for the uae of assessment d*ta.  Dr. Vergason\n13 observed that it WAS necessary for him to combine the\n14 individual habilitation plan and the Lndividual education\n15 plan in order to obtain sufficient da a to create an\n16 adequate 1EP.  Dr. Vergason concedes hat the IEP should\n17 have all of the education goals conta ned in that plan.  Dr.\nDevelopment Center is\n18 Vergason testified that the Arlington\nleast restrictive\n19 doing well in placing students in the\nenvironment and that he has observed mprovements in\n21 attitude, institutional technique, ma erials and activities,\n22 His testimony was that Arlington Deve opment Center is\n23 moving \"in the right direction.\"  Dr. Vergason's\n24 credibility, however, was placed at iissue and in question\n25 because hie initial opinions were giv<»n without the benefit\n\nFROM 11.81.1995  15:42 P. 28\n2?\n1 of an adequate review.  His conclusions, generally, however,\ni\n2 are not irreconcilable with the proof: submitted by the\n3 United states through Dr. Susan Thibaieau, the May Center\n4 program director.  Dr. Thibadeau pointed out from lier three\n5 visits to Arlington Development Center, that the individual\n6 educational plans, iEP'e are inadequate under IDEA\n7 standards.  Specifically, the goals aid objectives are not\n8 sufficiently comprehensive and the system is inadequate to\n9 measure progress.  In fact, that was Very, very clearly\n30 demonstrated.  Dr. Thibadeau gave numorous examples' from\n11 actual students at Arlington Development Center in jthat\n12 regard.  She also testified that related services are not\ni\nadequately incorporated for —  into the educational process.\nFor example, the physical therapist interviewed did! not even\n15 know what an individual education plan was.  Yet, ufith this\n16 student population, physical therapy must work cloajely with\n17 education in order to achieve educational objectives since\nIB many of those objectives are functional in nature. '\nReviewing the testimony of Dr. Vergaeon in conjunction with\n20 the testimony of Dr. Thibadeau, the evidence weighs heavily\n21 in favor of determination that Arlington Development Center\ni,B not in compliance with IDEA.  ;\n23 Now, whilo 1 have told you about failure to comply\n:  I\n24 i\nwith the Fourteenth Amendment,  I am compelled to ma'ke one\nAdditional observation regarding the danger that Arlington\n\nFROM 11.01.1995  15:42 P. 29\nresidents currently face.  The Court has indicated that in\n;  i\neach of tho areas cited by the United States, the Uijdted\ni\nStates has carried its burden of proof.  But the CoUrt\nshould note specifically thai in the medical care area and\nin the area of direct staff supervision of patients or\nresidents, conditions at Arlington Development Center pose >\nan immediate danger of irreparable harm, including an active\nrisk of death to patients at Arlington Development tenter.1\n'  . i\nMedical care within the institution/ particularly for\ni  '  !  i\n10\npatients with seizure disorders, is so deviant from I any,,\n11\nrecognized principles of medical oare that any patient\n12\nsuffering prolonged seizures; or status epilepticus iay be in\n13\nimmediate peril of his life.\n14\nThe testimony is virtually uncontradicted:that no\n15\nstandard of care recognizes the administration of\n16\nintramuscular Vallum for status epilepticus and that the\n17\nonly appropriate treatment for status epilepticus involving\n18\ni\nthe use of Vallum is IV Valium.  Similarly/ the failure of\n19\ndirect care staff to directly and properly supervises\n20\nindividuals with known behavior disorders, including eating\n21\ndisorders, has resulted in deaths whidh were entirely\n22\npreventable.  In fact, during these proceedings one resident\n23\nof Arlington Development Center, Jane E. died.  Jane E. died\n24\non Thursday, September 14, 1993 at 8i32 p.m., on tho 9th day\n25\nof the trial of this case.  This is evidenced in Trial\n\nFROM 11.01.1995  15:43 P.30\n1  Exhibit 384.  The cause of her death, the Court finds,, was\n2  lack of supervision, complicated by lack of.adequate\n3  emergency medical treatment.\n4  While tha State of Tennessee may -- it nay be\n5  argued has begun to make improvements or to at least\n6  institute processes' that might lead to improvements at\n7  Arlington Development Center, it does not appear that at\n6  this time thone improvements have either been sufficiently\n9  implemented or continue to be Implemented in such a way as\n10  to preclude the necessity of injunctive relief.\nIn analyzing the appropriate relief in this case,\njhe plaintiffs argue that the defendants have demonstrated\n13  unwillingness to provide Arlington Development Center\n14  residents with constitutional levels of care..  The United\nIB  States further argues that their resistance to taking\n16  meaningful, voluntary corrective action is so pronounced as\ni\n17  to be deliberate.  Plaintiff points to the defendants'\n16  refusal to acknowledge the existence of deficiencies from\n19  the time of the issuance by the United States of its\n20  findings letter in March of 1991.  The United States points\n21  to the extraordinary step taken by the Tennessee General\n22  assembly to repeal state statutes that suggested that the\n23  defendants were responsible for the care of mentally\n24  retarded persons at Arlington Development Center.\nThere has been proof in thiB case, some of which\n25\n\nFROM\n11.01.1995  15S43\nP.31\n30\nhas olready been referred to, which supports the position\ntaken by the United states. During s case, there has\nbeen the late dellvory by the State Tennessee of\ndocuments sought in discovery, documents which were\ndetrimental to the case presented by the State of Tennessee.\nIt could bo argued that there has beeh an effort, as\ndemonstrated by Exhibit 414, by Arlington Development Center\ni\nto misrepresent the nature of these proceedings and to\nfrighten the families and friends of residents at Arlington\n10\nDevelopment Center.\n11\nThere has been testimony by former employees of\n12\nArlington Development Center of an atmosphere of\n13\nintimidation.  One doctor in hie letter of resignation\naddressed to Dr. Thomas McLemore of December 10, 1990,\nstated I have never before worked in a climate such as\n16\nexistB at Arlington Development Center, the leadership is\n17\npoor and one has difficulty in justifying some of the\nIB\nmedical situations that seem to have{to be tolerated becausi\n19\nof administrative influence.  It seeijis to me to be a lack o\n20 genuine concern by some of the administrative staff for the\n21 residents who live here and especially for the employees whe\n22 are charged with their care.  Sincerely yours, George\n23 P. Jones M. D. That is Exhibit 376. :\n24 Two highly sought after employees in psychology'\nleft Arlington Development Center when their efforts to,'\n\n-FROM 11.81.1995  15:44 P.32\ncompile and report to the administration a list of .suspected*\n•physical and verbal abuse by direct care staff of Arlington\nDevelopment Center were detected.  The supervisor, Vickie\nThompson and her supervisor, Assistant Superintendent\nRobinson, upon learning of the list demanded a copy and then\nanother Arlington supervisory employe^, Mr. Durr, gave\ncopies of that list to the employees who were suspected of\npossible abuse, either physical or verbal.  Two employees,\nRebecca Palmer and Sherry Wilson, found their jobs made\n10  impossible, understandably, because of the actions of the\n11  administrator's intent on protect possible abusers as\n12  opposed to protecting and disciplining individuals for that\n13  offense,  in fact, Ms. Palmer was reprimanded for her\naction.  No investigation was conducted regarding the\nemployees who were identified as possible abusera.  And I'm\n16  not referring to pome perfunctory review, I will talk about\n1,-omo of those later, but no meaningful investigation was\nconducted.\nMs. Wilson and Ms. Palmer both testified in these\n20  proceedings.  Ms. Wilson has a masters in special education\n21  and now works at Open Arms, a group home in the Frayser area\n22  of Memphis.  Ms. wilcon testified regarding a lack of\n23  general care, a lack of interaction and a lack of teaching\n24  at the Institution.  She observed poor feeding and bathing\n25  practices and observed on occasion five or six females in'\n\n\"FROM 11.01.1995  15:44 P. 33\n32\nline naked in tho bathroom.  Vickie Thompson, the immediate\nsupervisor told Ms. Wilson when Ms. Wilson inquired about\nthe lack of caro that \"I give staff rest time\" between\nModicaid reviews and Department of Justice inspections.\nRebecca Palmer also testified in this case.  She\nha£3 a bachelors degree in psychology and is now a team\nleader at Southern Oklahoma Resource Center.  She took a\nposition at Arlington Development Center in January, 1991\nend found tho atmosphere negative and intimidating.  She\n10 observed a lack of affection for residents, the use of harsh\nvoice tones and a severe Jack of training.  The staff which\n11\nwas charged with supervising residents spent time watching\n12\ntelevision, and Mr. Durr, as had Mrs. Thompson, gave the\n13\nexcuse that \"we work hard during surveys, therefore, we\n14\ndon't work as hard at other times.1'\nIS\n16 Ms. Palmer observed that the residents; were not\n17 treated with respect and that there was evidence of physical\n18 abuse, but as noted above, her efforts to initiate an\n19 investigation in that regard only resulted in her receiving\n20 a reprimand and no meaningful investigation being conducted.\n21 Ms. Palmer's husband, Roland Palmer, also worked\n22 at Arlington Development Center for the period January 11,\n23 1991 through June 3, 1991. He is also now located in\n24 Oklahoma.  But while at Arlington Development Center, he was\n25 the director of psychology,  Vickie Thompson was his\n\nFROM\n11.61.1995  15:45\nP.34\nsupervisor.  When he arrived, he found a virtual absence of\npsychological services.\nIt is perhaps instructive to observe what the\nouperintendent of Arlington Development Center wrote to the\nCommissioner of Mental Health and Mental Retardation on\nJanuary *i, 1991, regarding Mr. Palmer.  She wrote as follows\nin advocating his retention by the institution:  We cannot\nafford to IORO this most qualified —  the roost qualified\ncandidate recruited since May, 1989, when the position was\nJO vacated.  Further, this request is justified, that was the\nrequest to deviate so they could employ Mr. Palmer'or Dr.\nPalmer.  Further, this request is justified because of our\n12\ncritical need to have the required doctoral expertise as\n13\nhead of a service component impacting all individuals Be r vet\n14\nat the facility.  The psychological director —  excuse roe,\nIS\nthe psychology director is responsible for the overall\n16\n17 development and implementation of facility-wide behavioral\nmanagement strategies.  It is the effectiveness of those\nIB\nstrategies that allows the accomplishment of all other\n19\nhabilitative efforts.  For four and a half years/ the\n20\ncontinued absence of a psychological director has placed Ui\n21\nin a vulnerable position in maintaining certification and\n22\naccreditation.  Considering our present Department of\n23\nJustice investigation of,the quality of our services, our\n24\ntime is running out/ we must have a psychology director.\n25\n\nFROM 11.01.1995  15:45 P.35\n1 She went on to say Dr. Palmer has the directly related\n2 experience to meet our needs and is the only applicant\n3 having this experience to present reasonable Balary\n4 expectations.  Dr. Palmer has a total of four years, one\n5 month professional psychologist experience*  Two years and\n6 two months of this .experience was obtained at a facility\n7 under the same regulations as we must operate.  He haB a\nS Ph.D.  and masters degree in psychology, both with a\n9 concentration in mental retardation.  That letter was sent\n10 to Commissioner Taylor front Mona Reeves-Winfrey dated\n11 January 7, 1991, and is Exhibit 268 in this case.\n12 Dr.  palmer testified in these prcceedings.  As I\n13 have indicated, ho found staff with little professional\n14 training.  He cited a number of examples, including that of\n15 a patient whose first name is Philip who had a behavioral\n16 disorder in which he struck the corner of tables with his\n17 head.  This was a serious condition which Dr. Palmer\n18 immediately recognized.  In fact, Dr. Palmer personally\n19 bought a helmet and trained staff regarding the use of the\n20 hoimet in order to reduce the personal injury to Philip.\ni\n1 21 Ironically, Thompson and Riddle, employees at Arlington\n22 Development Center, attempted to oppose the use of the\n23 helmet, both displaying a lack of knowledge regarding\ni\ni\ni 24 regulations concerning restraint of which this helmet was\ni\n] 25 not.  Palmer made recommendations regarding obtaining\n\n-  FROM 11.02.1995  12: 32 P.  3\n35\npsychiatric services, including the consultative iservices of\na psychiatrist.  Ho routinely found inadequate staffing,,\nthat is one staff parson to as many as 16 residents at\"\nArlington, and routinely found staff watching television.\nHe found poor and disruptive attitudes by the staff.  When\ngiven the task of reviewing the Department of Juejtice\nfindings latter which has been marked as an exhibit in this\ncase, Dr. Palmer'&- review was unsatisfactory to Arlington\nDevelopment Center; that ie, it reported that the Department\n10 of Justice was correct, and it appeared to Dr. Paliner that\nli the superintendent at that time concurred in his findings.\n12 But as you know, the conditions regarding the continued\ni\n13 employment of Ms. Palmer, and as you may not know, the\n14 frustrations of Dr. Palmer in attempting to perform his\n15 duties at Arlington Development Center led to their leaving\n16 Arlington Development Center.  Of course, Rebecca Palmer, as\n17 you know, left Arlington Development Center because\n18 conditions had boon made impossible and neither Of them was\nallowed to exercise their professional judgment ^t the\n20 institution.\n21 This attitude of obstruction within the\n22 institution was dramatically demonstrated in an incident\n23 which occurred on December 11, 1992, which is reflected in\nExhibits 275 and 275A in this record.\n25 On December 11, 1992, shortly after nobn,\n\nFROM 1 1 .02.  1995  12i32 P.  4\n36\nLieutenant Kobort Yoakum of the Tennessee Highway Patrol\nreceived a call from the state department, that Is from the\npolice department in Brownsville, Tennessee.  Th# call was\nthat two state vans had stopped at a store and the drivers\nhad purchased one quart of beer each and then proceeded\ntoward Brownsville on Highway 19.  The vans were loaded with\nresidents from Arlington Development Center.  Tht vans were\n{stopped by Trooper Joe Crook and officer Mark Williams of\nthe liaywood County Sheriff's Department.\n10 Trooper Cook or Crook detected an odor: of alcohol\n11 from each driver'G broath.  One of the drivers whs Larry\nWilliams, an employee of Arlington Development Center, who\n13 stated to Lieutenant Yoakum that both he and Cornell\ni\n14 Willison had stopped at a store in Lauderdale Cojunty and had\n35 purchased o quart of beer each.  Willison, the other driver\n16 who was also from Arlington Development Center, confirmed\n17 that they had both drunk a quart of beer each.\n18 Lieutenant Yoakum then called Mona Reeves-Winfrey,\n19 the superintendent of Arlington Development Center, and\n20 reported what had happened.  H« reported that the drivers  —\n21 he reported the driver's condition and he further reported\n22 that each driver stated he knew the seriousness of his\nactions and that they had made an error in judgment.\n23\nThe notes of the call* made by Ms. Winfrey at the\n24\ntime of her conversation with Lieutenant Yoakum state\n25\n\nFROM 11 .02. 1995  12:33 P. 5\n\"obviously, blown out of proportion.\"  When the employees\nreturned, they were not placed on suspension, but' an\ninvestigation wap conducted by June Stewart with ja report to\nEdna Robinson.  Juno Stewart, despite the admission of these\ntwo individuals, found that this was simply a case'of\nmisidentificotion and that the two Arlington employees had\nnot purchased any beer at all.  The report concluded on\nDecember 11, they were notified that no action was being\ntaken in this matter and that they were to return to work on\n10 their noxt scheduled work day of December 12, 1992.  See\n11 Trial Exhibit 275A for a full statement of the events.\n12  Ms. Reeves-Winfrey wrote the letter to the two\n13  employees confirming that no —  \"no action is deemed\n14  iiecoesary on tho part of Arlington Development Center.\"\n15  This was in spite of the fact that Ms. Reeves-Winfrey had\n16  talked directly with Lieutenant Yoakum and that she knew\n17  that there was no mieidentification as reported by June\n18  Stewart in hor report.  .\n19  Ms. Stewart's report was a hastily done document\n20  with no inquiry to the State of Tennessee, with no\n21  investigation with Lieutenant Yoakum/ obtained no\n22  documentation that WOE available readily from the State of\n23  Tennessee.  MR. June Stewart's report was consistent with\n24  the manner of doing business at Arlington Development\n25 Center.\n\nF'ROM 11.82.1995 12:33 P. 6\n38\n1 In this case, there has been testimony! regarding\n2 doing things the Arlington Way/' The Arlington Why, as\n]\n3\ndescribed by Dr. Palmer and Rebecca Palmer and Ms. Wilson\n4 and  as  reflected  in  the  action  of  Arlington  DeveXoptnetvfe\n5 Center in the incident of December 11, 1992/ and throughout\n6 its conduct in this case,'is a system or policy under which*\n7 the convenience And job security of employees ia>\n8 consistently placed above the constitutional rights of\n-  i\n9 residents of Arlington Development CentertV\n10 The Arlington way is reflected in the irecordation\n11 of injuries which were the subject of extensive testimony, in\n12 this cneo.  it is reflected in the conduct — in the\n13 conducted tours and the lack of services when third parties\n14 or inspectors ore not present, 'i It is reflected ^nther\nIS higher than normal mortality rate, the higher than normal\n16 injury rate, the failure to effectuate any meaningful\n17 behavior modification programs for residents in need of that\n18 training,  it is reflected by the fact that there is very\n19 little staff turnover and that there are very few, as\n20 evidenced by the testimony of the superintendent,\n21 investigations of abuse, much less any discipline for\n22 resident abuse.\n23 It is reflected in the testimony of the parents.\n24 In this case, a number of parents testified, and I, don't\n25 disregard the testimony of those parents who hope for the\n\nF-ROM\n11.82.1995  12:34 P. ?\nbest at Arlington Development Center and I'm thankful that\nnot every parent has had a terrible experience there with a\ndevastating result, but the testimony that is persuasive\nfrom the parents in this case was the testimony given by\nCarolyn Tucker whose daughter was admitted to Arlington\nDevelopment Contot,, a happy, higher functioning individual\nat the institution who, because of a failure to provide\nproper treatment, and I'm not talking about a failure of\njudgment, I'm talking about a failure of any remqtely\n10 correct medical judgment at all is now unable to |function*\nli Those ovento, I'm cure for those of you were who were here\n12 and heard tho testimony, were particularly disturbing\n13 because Carolyn Tucker was on the phone, in fact, telling\n14 Dr. Herring the correct procedure for cause —  for allowing\n15 her daughter to come out of status epilepticus. ,Dr.\nHerring/ when tho seizure began and, in fact, Stevelyn\n17 Tucker hod an aura and knew the seizure was to begin because\nthat was how her seizures manifested themselves*  Dr.\n19  Herring gave her Vallum IM, that is intramuscularly.  The\n20  testimony was simply overwhelming in the case, as 1 have\n?.i  previously indicated, that that is .not effective in these\n22  circumstances.  Most Badly, Carolyn Tucker was on the phone\n23  trying to locate her daughter whom she spoke to regularly\n24  most every evening.  At first, there was some confusion\n25  about where che was, and ultimately she was able to talk to\n\nFROM 11.82.1995  12:34 P. 8\n40\nof tho modicnl personnel.  She had told all of the\nmedical personnel when her daughter was Admitted in March of\n1991 that when these events occurred, she had in |the past\nBuccoGsfully been treated with Valium intravenously.  She\nalso had told them that she had very severe seizures.  On\nthe phone that night, she told Dr. Herring they had to start\nValium intravenously.  That is, of 'course, the prescribed\n8  method of treatment.  But the seizure continued for three or\ni\nfour hours.  Dr. Herring did not start the proper procedure.\n10  Ultimately, Stevelyn Tucker was transported to Lebonheur\nHospital where, of course, she lingered close to death and\nnow one of tho highest functioning individuals at that\n13  institution, a person who could speak, a person Who could\n14  lead a clone to normal life for someone in that\n15  circumstance, a person who had wanted to go to Arlington so\n16  ohe could be with people like herself because it was hard\n17  going to school in middle Tennessee and this was a better\n18  institution for her, that person now is deprived of any\n19  chance whatsoever of fulfilling those goals.  It's a tragic\n20  thing that happened that day, but it was the Arlington way\n21  because Dr. Herring was not disciplined*  In the mortality\n22  review Dr. Herring was not sanctioned and he's still there\n23  at Arlington Development Center.\n24  J inutile Davis talked about her sister Bobbie.  I\n25  brought the photographs of Ms. —  of her sister here,\n\nFROM 11.02.1995  12:35\nP. 9\nBarbara S.  I'm not going to show you those photographs\nbecause she has got terrible bruising, terrible bruising on\nthe front of her body, black eyes.  When she went to\nArlington, that wasn't the circumstance.  The superintendent\nwhen confronted with the evidence said she couldn't* have\ndone this to herself, and the Court agrees, but the\ninvestigation blamed it on the resident, a common phenomenon\ne  at Arlington.  Of course, the residents have trouble with\n1\ncredibility becauoe they are there because of their mental •\n10  or physical disabilities.  No effective investigation was\n11 conducted.\n12.  Peggy Moore testified regarding her brother Mac.\n13  Mrs. Moore'B mother is now 74 years old and she took care of\n14  Mac for approximately 40 years of his life.  Mac was finally\n15  placed at Arlington.  He was a large individual, apparently\n16  very gregarious, cat at the table, enjoyed eating with the\n17  family.  The family noted that he ate too fast, so they\n18  would say, \"Mac, don't eat so fast,11 or \"Mac, slow down,\n19  it's not going to go away.\"  He would respond to that.\n20  Finally, because of his mother's advanced age and because of\n21  his disabilities, he was placed at Arlington.  When he went\n22  to Arlington, he weighed about 230 pounds.  He was a large\n23  person.  He was also a very tall person.  Arlington, of\n24  course, put him on a diet to where eventually he got down to\n25  140.  I think the diet just continued, nobody really\n' T\n\nFROM\n11.02.1995  12:35\nP. 10\n42\n1 monitored it that much.  It was very inconvenient:to have a\n2 large patient that they couldn't handle very well, although\n3 Mac could respond to verbal commands, but anyway, he was  —\n4 his weight was greatly reduced.  He ultimately died as a\n5 result of his eating disorder, fiheryl McCollum teotified\nG regarding her Ron Eric,  There was other testimony about\n7 Eric in the record.  Eric has two dislocated hips, but\n8 apparently thai; wasn't noted for some period of time at\n9 Arlington.  Mrs. McCollum was understandably upset when she\nXO went on a recent visit to him because she found him soaked\n11 in urine.  !*• wan not uncommon for people who made\n12 observations at Arlington to find situations in which\n13 patients had not been cleaned up, and on occasion,\n14 apparently Arlington personnel would say, ••!£ we;had known\n15 you were coming, we would have cleaned him or heir up.\"\n16 Sam Nuckolls testified in this case regarding his\n17 eon.  His son had severe disabilities, but had lived at home\n18 and had been taught to help ~  considerable amount of\n19 self'help.  He had been taught to feed himself with a spoon.\n20 He had been tnught to hold the cup and drink water from a\n21 straw.  He had been taught to stand and they had worked hard\n22 so he could bo an active and bright young man despite his\n23 disabilities.  Mr. Nuckolls determined that it was\n24 appropriate for his son to be placed at Arlington.  I think\n25 it is fair to say that Arlington makes a good superficial\n\nFROM 11.02.1995  12:36 P. 1 1\n43\npresentation and that roost individuals would expect that the\ninstitution could provide adequate care.  His son was placed\nat Arlington and regressed greatly.  He lost his ability to\nhold a cup or do those other things that he had been taught\nto do.  The expert testimony establishes that in this, case,\nindividuals have to be trained repeatedly.  They can't\nsimply remember from long periods of time how to $o a\n6  function.  And if they're not consistently helped and\nreminded, if they don't use that function regulariy, they\n10  will lose that part of their life which has been enriched.\n11  That happened with Mr- Nuckolla' son.  An interesting thing\n12  also happened, they —  Mr. Nuckolls, of course, as with all\n13  parents who ie concerned about the health and welfare of his\n14  child, they wanted to strengthen his leg muscles and they\n15  bought a prone standor that allows the individual to be\n16  placed in the standing position.  It improves their muscle\n17  tone.  It assists them to the degree that they can to avoid\n18  regression and aloo hopefully to have some actual\nid  improvement over long periods of time.\n20  After awhile, he noticed that the leg stander\n21  seemed to always be in the same place when they came to\n22  visit his son.  So he simply put something on the stander so\n23  he could see if anybody moved it or used it.  And when they\n24  came back later, not immediately later, but some days later\n25  as you or 1 might now suspect, it had not been used.  That\n\n11.02.1995  12:36 P. 12\nFROM\ndevice, which should be used on a regular basis, which\nphysical therapy would require its use, was not used at all.\nPeggy Ann Perkins Derringer also testified\nregarding her daughter Heather. • Heather/ when she went to\nArlington was able to ride a big wheel.  She could walk and\nrun and was a happy, bright child.  8he could swim.  In\nfact, during that part of the testimony, or some part of the\n8  testimony, I asked about the pool at Arlington because I\nknew that they hod a pool, but it turned out that it doesn't\n10  have any water in it and haBn't for a number of years.  But\nXI  anyway, she went, to the —  she went to Arlington because her\n12  mother at the time could not continue to provide the care\n13  needed and they had a number of children.  Her mother since\n14  has gone on to become, it's my recollection, a nurse, and is\n15  now, I believe, at St. Jude Hospital, but —  at One of the\n16  hospitals here in Memphis.\n17  Her daughter is no longer at Arlington and has now\n18  had some surgery which considerably improved her condition.\n19  But the reason that her daughter didn't have that surgery\n20  earlier, the reason that her daughter didn't have that\n21  surgery at Arlington -- and let me say this about her.\n22  situation, it was clear front the record that her daughter's\n23  condition at Arlington as of the condition of other children\n24  that I have described, deteriorated at Arlington,  Now, we\n25  all understand that there may be some deterioration with\n\nFROM\n11.02.1995  12i37 P. 13\n4\ni\no£ this patient population, but these individual©\nsuffered deterioration which VOLB not because of the natural\nprogression of the condition/ At was tho result of failure\nto provide appropriate care, a failure to provide physical\ntherapy on a regular and consistent basis, a failure to\nprovide any program which would allow them to continue or\nhavo eome reasonable hope of continuing to have those few\nthings in life which made life enjoyable or pleasant.  Why\ndidn't her daughter have the surgery while she was at\n10 Arlington?  why did eho have it later?  She didn't have.that\n11 surgery because the doctor who recommended surgery to\n12 correct strictures that had occurred because of the fact\n13 that her child had been placed in a wheelchair and not been\n14 allowed to ambulate as she should have been allowed to\n15 ambulate, bocauso the doctor told her, and it was part of\nthe record in this case in Exhibit 202, and at least\n17 Arlington was on notice of this, even if it wasn't a major\nfactor, but the doctor told her that Arlington couldn't\nIB\n19 provide appropriate follow-up care.  It was because of the\npoor quality of! physical therapy at Arlington Development\n20\nCenter.  That's consistent with all of the testimony\n21\nregarding physical therapy at Arlington Development Center*\n22\nAll of those recent examples that X have given to\nyou are examples of the Arlington way.  A system designed\n24\na system that follows a policy of convenience for employees\n25\n\nFROM 1 1.02.  1995  12:37 P.  14\n46\nof casting the blame on a resident where there be, some*\nfault of an employee, a failure to investigate, because there\n;\nis a policy of virtually no discipline of employs'es at\nArlington Development Center in most oases.\nA defense witness in this case, Dr. Philip Siring,\nchairman of the Department of Pediatric at Chicago Medical\nSchool testified about the difficulty of changing an\ninstitutional culture.  Dr. Ziring had been at Willowbrook,\na very large institution in the State of New York, which,\n10  according to Dr. Ziring, was the institution, and the case\n11  that resulted in the enactment of CRIPA.  Arlington\n12  Development Center has the same problems that Dr. Ziring\n13  identified at Willowbrook.\n14  There are, of course, a number of specific actions\n15  which may be appropriate for a remedial order in this case.\n16  It is, however, the pervasive policy of elevating employee\n17  rights over the civil rights of residents that underlies the\n18  violations of rights in this case.\n19  The Court will enter a very brief injunction, in\n20  essence, a preliminary injunction in this case to deal with\n21  the immediate threat to human life at Arlington Development\n22  Center.  That order will be entered this afternoon and will\n23  be quite brief.\n24  •  The Court will also enter a broader injunction\nafter a 15-day opportunity for the State of Tennessee to\n\nFROM\n11.8.2.1995  12:38\nP. 15\n47\n1 comment on the proposed injunctive order submitted by the\n2 United States In this case.  The Court finds that the\n3 injunctlve order submitted by the United States generally\n4 covers those areas appropriate for relief in this case.\n5 Additionally, the Court will file additional\n6 findings of fact in this case to supplement the oral\n7 findings of the Court which were made here today•  Finally/\n0 the Court will require the State of Tennessee, that is the\n9 Commissioner in this case, to submit a plan to remedy the\n10 violations of constitutional rights and the deprivation of\n11 educational opportunities found to exist in this case.  That\n12 plan, after consultation with the United States, should l;e\n13 submitted by no later than Friday, January 21, 1994 at 5»00\n14 p.m.\n15 Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes these\n16 proceedings for today.\n17 MRS.

ADC's population consists primarily of individuals\ncurrently assessed as severely or profoundly retarded or\ndevelopmentally disabled, some of whom have associated physical\non docket sheet in compliance.jsiti_Bule 58\ndQeument ent\nU) FHCP on_\n\nhandicaps, medical problems, or behavior problems.  (Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 390-91; Ex. 244.)\n3.  Developmental disabilities include such conditions as\ncerebral palsy and mental retardation.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol..Ill at\n390-91.)  Persons with mental retardation have substantial\nlimitations in present functioning, characterized by\nsignificantly sub-average intellectual functioning existing\nconcurrently with limitations in applicable adaptive skill areas,\ne.g.. communication, self-care, social skills, self-direction,\nsafety, functional academics, leisure and work.  Mental\nretardation manifests before age 18.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I\nat 29.)\n4.  The functional capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of\npersons with mental retardation or other developmental\ndisabilities cannot be determined absent appropriate evaluation,\nanalysis and treatment implementation, individualized to the\nparticular person in question.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 43, 49;\nSzymanski, Tr. Vol. IV, generally and at 775-76, 878.)\n5.  Persons with developmental disabilities, including\nmental retardation, require treatment through the use of an\nindividualized assessment and treatment plan, known as the\nIndividual Habilitation Plan (IHP) at Arlington.  (Christian, Tr.\nVol. I at 49; Winfrey, Tr. at 136.)\n- 2 -\n\n6.  Services for persons with developmental disabilities,\nincluding mental retardation, must be developed on an individual\nbasis by a properly constituted interdisciplinary team.  An\ninterdisciplinary team must consist of, at a minimum, those\nindividuals who provide both clinical and direct care services\nfor the particular individual, including any specialty services,\nsuch as speech and hearing, communication, psychiatry, physical\ntherapy, occupational therapy, and any others whose presence is\nnecessary to ensure each individual's needs are met.  (Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 588; Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 155-56; Szymanski, Tr.\nVol. IV at 811.)\n7.  ADC's mission statement and obligation is to provide a\nbroad array of services to residents in accordance with their\nneeds which are identified in Individualized Habilitation Plans\nwhich institutional staff design for each individual.\n(Reeves-Winfrey, Tr. at 135; Ex. 241-44, 258.)\n8.  Since early 1993, Arlington has been engaged in\nimproving its data collection system, case management system,\nclinical aspects of behavior analysis, activities and training\nsystem on the Daniel Boone, Spruce, and Davy Crockett units, and\nthe quality management program, with the assistance of Behavior\nManagement Consultants, Inc.  Arlington plans to continue with\nthose improvements and to expand them to all living units at ADC\npursuant to a contract which extends to June 30, 1994.  (Cox, Tr,\n- 3 -\n\nat 287-90; Riordan, Tr. at 525-27; Mozingo, Tr. at 425-26;\nReeves-Winfrey, Tr. at 53-5; Bailey, Tr. at 609.)\n9.  However, the evidence shows that the conditions at\nArlington Developmental Center in 1990, 1991 and 1992, at the\ntime of testimony (even after the improvements listed above) and\ncontinuing through the present, do not comply with minimal\nrequirements under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Defendants fail\nto protect ADC residents from harm and fail to provide a safe and\nhumane environment at ADC.  (Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2845.)\n10.  Defendants are failing to provide residents with\nreasonable care and a reasonably safe environment.  ADC residents\nare subjected to serious harm and undue risks of harm due to\ninadequate supervision which results, at least in part, from\ninsufficient numbers of staff and inadequate training of the\nstaff available given the current number of residents at the\nfacility.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 48, 62-3, 67-8, 72;\nChristian, Tr. Vol. II at 261; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2766.)\n11.  During the past three years, ADC's own records\ndemonstrate that there have been over 6100 reported injuries to\nADC residents.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 79-80; Ex. 6, 7.)\n12.  Arlington has a system of policies and procedures for\ndocumenting incidents and injuries in which residents are\n- 4 -\n\ninvolved.  (Cox, Tr. at 307-09, 331; Reeves-Winfrey, Tr. at 64-\n65;  Bailey, Tr. at 685-86; Ex. 285, 286.)  Arlington compiles\nstatistics concerning incidents and injuries, and analyzes the\ndata for identification of trends and ways to possibly reduce the\nincident rate.  (Cox, Tr. at 308-14; Reeves-Winfrey, Tr. at 69-\n71;  Ex. 287, 288.)  However, ADC's recordkeeping system is\ninadequate and inaccurate.  Thus, the 6100 reported injuries\nunder-represents the actual number of injuries that occurred at\nADC.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 85-86; Christian, Tr. Vol. II at\n305-06; Reeves-Winfrey, Tr. at 186-97; Cox, Tr. at 394-411;\nEx.  11.)\n13.  The ADC staff is not properly trained and accordingly\nthey do not accurately record injuries or report them in a\nuniform manner.  This results in data collection which is\ninsufficient to develop behavior development plans.  (Christian,\nTr.  Vol. I at 84-90; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2766-83; Cox, Tr.\nat 394; Ex. 295.)\n14.  Defendants fail to meet their own direct care\nstaff\"1 to resident ratios on three shifts of 1:4  (day), 1:4\n(evening) and 1:8  (night); ratios are regularly much higher than\nthat, at times as high as one staff member for 16 residents.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 64, 66; Ex. 3-5; Christian rebuttal,\nC  The term \"direct care staff\" includes Developmental Technicians (OTs) and Developmental Technician\nTrainers (DTTs) as described in the Superintendent's testimony.\n- 5 -\n\nTr. at 2763-64, 2766-68; Reeves-Winfrey, Tr. at 136-37, 149-50.)\nEven where 1:4 staffing was present, direct care staff members\noften worked with only a single individual, leaving many others\nidle.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 69; Christian, Tr. Vol. II at\n226-28; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2762-64; Ex. 24, 26, 428.)\n15.  The training and skills of direct care staff are\ngrossly substandard.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 48, 68; Rol.\nPalmer, Tr. Vol. II at 1347-49.)  Direct care staff and\nsupervisors need additional training in recording and reporting\nof injuries, and in the supervision of residents sufficient to\nensure the residents' safety.  (Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2766-\n68.)  Many direct care staff do not fulfill their\nresponsibilities for the care of the residents entrusted to them.\n(Ex. 24, 25.)  Direct care staff often leave residents unattended\nor ignore residents when they require attention, particularly\nwhen they are engaging in self-injurious behaviors.  (Christian,\nTr. Vol. II at 194-95; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2773-7'4.)\n16.  Many of the injuries suffered by ADC residents are\nserious, including numerous major fractures, lacerations, which\nrequired stitches, and major bruises and abrasions.  Residents\nhave also lost their sight.  Examples of such injuries are:\nSandra H. and Mary B. lost sight in at least one eye from\naltercations with other residents.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I\nat 92.)  Grace M.'s elbow was pulverized.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I\n- 6 -\n\nat 88.)  Ronny S., a blind resident, lost part of a finger when\nanother resident slainmed a door on it.  Anthony W. broke his arm\nin a shower; Dottie B. broke six ribs.  There are a number of\nfractures of unknown origin.  Residents (e.g.. Gary B., M.G. H.)\nwere \"discovered\" with lacerations and large bruises which ADC\nlists as of unknown origin.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 97;\nE x.  9 - 1 0 .)  • - • • ' ..\n17.  ADC's supervision is so deficient that one resident,\nAdrian J., was bitten 22 times by another resident in a single\nincident.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 97; Bailey, Tr. at 860;\nEx.  6-7, 9-10, 20, 23, 127-95.)  As of March 1993, Adrian was\nstill being bitten.123\n18.  In addition to these severe injuries, ADC residents\nsuffered thousands of other injuries during this period.  These\ninjuries included cuts, scratches, abrasions, bruises, and bumps.\n(EX.  6, 186-90, 193-95.)\n19.  Defendants identify many of the injuries to ADC\nresidents as from \"unknown\" causes, meaning no staff were present\nat the time the injury occurred to witness the event.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 80-81; Cox, Tr. at 385-402; Ex. 6-7,\n10.)\nExamples identified in these proposed findings of fact do not constitute a complete recitation of\nall incidents supporting a particular finding.  The examples are simply illustrations of the\ndeficiencies supported in the record.\n- 7 -\n\n20.  Defendants do not sufficiently investigate and respond\nto injuries to residents and permit repeated injuries to the same\nresidents.  (Reeves-Winfrey, Tr. at 186-92; Cox, Tr. at 373, 391,\n393; Davis, Tr. at 1792-93; Ex. 23, 127-90, 193-95, 270.)\n21.  Staffing ratios for clients such as the majority of\nthose at ADC should be no less than that required to reasonably\nensure the safety of the residents.  A ratio of 1:4 is a general\nguideline, but many residents with self-injurious or aggressive\nbehavior may require higher staffing ratios, including some who\nrequire 1:1 ratios for the safety of themselves and other\nresidents.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 308, 311-12, 316; Rol.\nPalmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1346-47.)\n22.  ADC does not appropriately investigate or pursue\nreported instances of abuse (or severe neglect which could amount\nto abuse) of residents by staff members.  (Reb. Palmer, Tr. Vol.\nVII at 1432-41; Derringer, Tr. Vol. IX at 1861-68, 1871;\nMcCollum, Tr. Vol. IX at 1839-51; Davis, Tr. Vol. IX\nat 1788-1802; Rol. Palmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1354; Ex. 90, 127-90,\n193-95.)\n23.  Conditions at ADC regarding reasonable care and safety\nare a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,\npractice or standards.  These conditions continue to be unsafe,\nsubjecting residents to injury or a serious risk of injury.\n- 8 -\n\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 56-58; Christian rebuttal, Tr- at\n2767.)\nDEPENDANTS' HABILITATION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES\nAND RELATED TRAINING ARE SERIOUSLY DEFICIENT\n24.  Defendants' habilitation, psychology services, and\ntraining for these services are a substantial departure from\naccepted professional judgment, practice or standards.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 262.)\n25.  Arlington employs an interim Assistant Superintendent\nfor Programming Services who also serves as Director of\nPsychology.  (Cox, Tr. at 268.)  In the psychology department,\nthere are positions for three staff•behavior management\nspecialists, one additional Ph.D. staff psychologist, six\nmaster's level staff psychological examiners, and six staff\ncounselling associates.  In addition, there are contracts for\npart-time work for one Ph.D. counselling psychologist and two\nmaster's level psychological examiners, and two graduate students\nalso provide assistance.  (Cox, Tr. at 271-72.)  Three of the\npositions for psychological examiner are currently unfilled.\n(Cox, Tr. at 273.)\n26.  Defendants fail to regulate and review the use of\nrestraints, in any meaningful way, which cause harm to ADC\n- 9 -\n\nresidents or subjects them to significant risk of harm.\n(Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2794, 2818-21.)\n27.  Many residents of ADC exhibit behavior problems and\ninjure themselves or others.  Professionally developed and\nimplemented behavioral training programs, referred to as Behavior\nDevelopment Programs (BDPs) at ADC, are generally accepted by\nprofessionals as the means of addressing, ameliorating and\neliminating, to the extent possible, maladaptive behaviors.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 120-23, 125, 126; Christian Tr. Vol. II\nat 257.)\n28.  Very few of the BDPs at ADC provide replacement\nbehaviors or skill acquisition components as professionally\nrequired.  Additionally, ADC programs are deficient in properly\nanalyzing the causes of maladaptive behaviors, e.g.. there is no\nfunctional analysis.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 186-87, 257-58;\nRol. Palmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1324; See Ex. 92 (ADC informed of\nneed for functional analysis by staff psychologist.in 1991).)\n. 29.  As a result of inappropriate staff responses to\nresident behaviors, such as rewarding inappropriate behavior or\nfailing to reinforce appropriate behavior, residents develop and\ncontinue dangerous maladaptive behaviors which, in turn, lead to\nincreased numbers of injuries.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II\nat 194-95, 203-10, 327, 335; See Ex. 14, 31.)\n- 10 -\n\n30.  Defendants' failure to provide and implement adequate\ntraininq proqrams has led to residents enqaqinq in self-\ninjurious, aggressive or other dangerous behaviors.  (Christian,\nTr. Vol. I at 81; Tr. at 625 (staff must be constantly vigilant);\nSee Ex. 21, 14, 31.)  Residents have gouged their faces,\ndestroyed their ears, cut and bruised themselves and broken arms\nand ribs.  (Ex. 6, 7, 127-190, 193-95.)\n31.  Examples of injuries occurring as a result of ADC's\nfailure to provide appropriate programs include: Philip R. banged\nhis head so frequently that his lower jaw was constantly injured,\nopen, or covered with scar tissue.  He subsequently died.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 108; Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 306,\n340.)  Resident Harry J. picks at a \"hole11 he has developed on\nhis cheek from his maladaptive behavior.  Althouqh this resident\ncontinues to pick at the hole in his cheek, his program has been\ndiscontinued.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 106; Christian, Tr. Vol.\nII at 164.)  Leroy P. has had repeated surgeries to remove\nplastic bags and other objects he has ingested from his\nintestinal tract.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 108, Christian, Tr.\nVol. II at 172-73.)  Other residents have vomited foreign objects\nthey have eaten.  Carol W. banqs her nose and hand mouths.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 171-72; Mozinqo, Tr. at 500-01;\nEx. 24.)  Dwight C. bites numerous residents, some on multiple\noccasions.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 178-80; Ex. 23.)  Other\n- 11 -\n\nresidents exhibit significant scarring from the multiple,\nrepeated injuries each has suffered.  (Ex. 6, 7, 12, 13.)\n32.  Defendants are failing to provide individualized,\nprofessionally designed behavior programs to all of the residents\nof ADC who need or can benefit from them.  This is due, in part,\nto defendant's failure to recognize both the severity of-\nresidents' behaviors (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 48-49 and their\ncapacity for growth and development.  (See Ex. 308.)  Presently,\nonly 68 ADC residents have behavior training programs.  Many more\nresidents need such programs.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 130;\nRol. Palmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1324; Ex. 18, 88.)\n33.  Programs to teach adaptive behaviors, including self-\nhelp skills, communication, social?skills, and skills to enhance\nindependence, are essential to the physical and mental health and\nsafety of residents.  Such programs are not professionally\ndesigned and/or implemented at ADC.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I\nat 31; Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 122-23, 256, 261; .Szymanski, Tr.\nVol. IV at 809-10.)\n34.  Defendants' failure to provide and implement programs\nwhich both reduce and replace maladaptive behavior and foster\nacquisition and maintenance of adaptive behaviors, due to the\nlack of adequate numbers of properly trained and supervised\nstaff, has led to an increase in serious maladaptive behaviors by\n- 12 -\n\nresidents that has resulted in injuries to themselves and other\nresidents.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 48; Vol. II at 190-91, 261-\n62.)\n35.  Defendants' behavior programs focus solely on the\nreduction of inappropriate behaviors.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol. IV at\n782.)  The psychiatrists and psychologists at ADC are not\ninvolved in the planning for total programming, including skill\nacquisition.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol. V at 877-78, 937.)\n36.  Idleness among persons with developmental disabilities\nmay lead to the development of maladaptive behaviors even in\nresidents who do not currently exhibit such behaviors.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 192-94, 262.)  Many ADC residents sit\nidle for prolonged periods of time, with nothing to do and without\nany stimulating interaction with staff.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II\nat 194-96; Szymanski, Tr. Vol. V at 822-24; Christian rebuttal,\nTr. at 2763.)\n37.  ADC does not provide residents at ADC (including those\nwho are nonverbal and/or nonambulatory) needed, .consistent,\npositive interaction.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 162; Rol.\nPalmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1348; Ex. 90, 91.)\n38.  No psychologist at ADC, including the Director of\nPsychology, has the necessary experience in behavioral psychology\n- 13 -\n\nor has been adequately trained in behavioral psychology.\n(Christian, Tr- Vol.!-II at 257, 301-02.)  As the consequence,\nthey are not able to adequately develop and implement training\nprograms for residents with aggressive, self-abusive and other\ndangerous behaviors.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 278-79, 301-02.)\n39.  The few programs on the Daniel Boone unit, ADC's \"model\nunit\" for behavior training, are deficient in that they fail to\nadequately address skill acquisition, they are not based upon\nreliable, objective criteria and accurate data, (Cox, Tr. at\n395-97, 402.) and they are not being appropriately and\nconsistently implemented.  (Riordan, Tr. at  566-67; Christian\nrebuttal, Tr. at 2767-69.)\n40.  Lack of adequately trained direct care staff has led to\ndirect care staff being unfamiliar with the training programs for\nthose residents for whose care they are responsible.  (Rol.\nPalmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1347; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2760,\n2766, 2768.)  This results in programs not being followed or\nproperly implemented.  Additionally, some direct care staff\nsimply fail to implement training programs.  (Christian rebuttal,\nTr. at 2772-73, 2784-86, 2801-03.)\n41.  Defendant's failure to monitor and regulate the use of\nrestraints, both physical and chemical, at ADC is a substantial\ndeparture from professional judgment, practice, or standards.\n- 14 -\n\n(Cox, Tr. at 376-80, 383-84; Rol. Palmer, Tr. Vol. VII\nat 1338-39; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2818-20; Ex. 289, 290.)\n42.  Defendants have no restraint log, making necessary\nbehavior management and human rights review of restraint usage at\nADC impossible.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 51, 53; Christian\nrebuttal, Tr. at 2818.)  Residents are subjected to physical\nrestraints, i.e.. helmets or mitts, to control their self-\ndestructive behaviors in lieu of training programs designed to\nreduce or eliminate such behaviors.  In other cases, Defendants\nare failing to use restraints temporarily with an appropriate\nbehavior program even where residents are exposed to serious,\npotentially life-threatening danger.  (Rol. Palmer, Tr. at 1327-\n32; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2821.)\n•»\n43.  The Behavior Management and Human Rights Committees at\nADC do not function in a professional manner  (Christian, Tr. Vol.\nI at 56; Christian Vol. II at 233-35, 239, 260-61.) and exercise\nno professional judgment.\n44.  Many injuries, the use of restraints, and the intensity\nof maladaptive behaviors exhibited by residents could be\nprevented or ameliorated if residents had appropriate training\nprograms and Defendants provided sufficient numbers of adequately\ntrained staff to implement them.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II\nat 261-62; Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2844-45; See Ex. 14, 31.)\n- 15  -\n\n45.  Defendants' failure to review and update residents'\ntraining programs is due, in part, to insufficient numbers of\npsychologists and other professional staff at ADC, as well as\ninadequately trained professional staff, as stated above.\n(Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 243.)\n46.  Notwithstanding Defendants' claims that improvements in\ntraining and psychological services have recently been made,\nhabilitation and training programs and psychological services,\neven on Daniel Boone unit, continue to be a substantial departure\nfrom accepted judgment, practice or standards, which subject\nresidents to harm.  (Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 262; Christian\nrebuttal, Tr. at 2766-67.)\nMEDICAL CARE AND RELATED HEALTH SERVICES ARE GROSSLY DEFICIENT\n47.  Defendants' medical care and related health services in\nthose areas listed below are grossly deficient, and are resulting\nin unnecessary resident illnesses, deformities, suffering and\ndeath.\n48.  Arlington employs four full-time primary care\nphysicians and a medical director, each appropriately licensed.\nThere is a fifth physician position that is currently unfilled.\nOn-site physician coverage is provided 24 hours a day, seven days\na week.  (McLemore, Tr. at 1700-02.)\n- 16 -\n\n49.  Within 24 hours of admission, each new resident\nreceives a physical examination by one of the staff physicians,\nincluding a comprehensive array of routine tests, as well as\ntests pertinent to the resident's specific medical conditions.\nThereafter, routine physical examinations and standard lab tests\nare performed on an.annual basis.  All residents receive routine\nimmunizations, including immunizations against hepatitis.\nResidents are provided with routine gynecological and\nophthalmological exams and mammograms.  (McLemore, Tr. at\n1702-05, 1710-11.)\n50.  On-site resources include a pharmacy, laboratory, x-ray\n(24 hours a day/7 days a week), EEG, EKG, ultrasound, and\nmammography.  Other specialized diagnostic testing is available\nat area hospitals.  Laboratory test results are obtained\novernight or can be obtained on an immediate basis, as needed.\n(McLemore, Tr. at 1710-11.)\n51.  Regular, on-site specialty consultation clinics are\ncurrently conducted in neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology,\ngynecology, and gastroenterology.  A broad array of other\noff-site specialty consultations are also available and regularly\nutilized.  There are no outside medical consultations providing\nneeded services that Arlington is unable to obtain.  (McLemore,\nTr. at 1712-14.)\n- 17 -\n\n52.  The system of primary health care at Arlington is a\nresidential model, with each physician assigned a specific living\nunit/caseload.  (McLemore, Tr. at 1706.)  Daily rounds to each\nliving unit by each physician are one aspect of the system for\nidentifying potential medical problems and follow-up and.\nmonitoring of previously identified conditions.  (McLemore, Tr.\nat 1706, 1723.)  Laboratory reports and reports from specialized\nconsultations are delivered to the nursing clinics located in\neach living unit area, are available during daily rounds, and are\nto be reviewed by the physician and placed in the resident's\nchart.  (McLemore, Tr. at 1715-16.)\n53.  Defendants have recently signed a one year contract\nwith the University of Tennessee to provide some essential\nmedical services to ADC residents,*the terms of the contract are\nconditional and for no longer than one year.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. IV\nat 624-25.)\n54.  Notwithstanding Defendants' claims that improvements\nhave recently been made in the provision of medical care, any\nsuch improvements have not remedied the grossly inadequate care,\nwhich continues to subject residents to avoidable suffering,\nmorbidity and mortality.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. IV at 648.)\n- 18 -\n\nFeeding Practices and Medical Management\nof Feeding—Related Disorders\n55.  Defendants' feeding practices at Arlington are\ndangerous, life-threatening, result in harm to residents, and\ncontinue to place residents at unreasonable risk of harm.  These\npractices are a substantial departure from accepted professional\nstandards or practices. (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 403-05, 417;\nTherriault, Tr. Vol. V at 993; and McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at\n1237-38.)\n56.  Such practices (e.g., bird feeding; inappropriately\npositioning residents before, during and after meals; feeding\nresidents too much, too fast, the wrong diet or food of\ninappropriate texture; and inadequately supervising residents\nwhile they are eating) have caused, and continue to cause,\nincreased risk of reflux, gagging, choking, aspiration,\naspiration pneumonia, asphyxiation and death among ADC residents.\n(McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1237-38; Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 403-17;\nTherriault, Tr. Vol. V at 1000-01, 1008-16; Hinkle, Tr. at\n2075-76, 2084-92; Hyman, video rebuttal Ex. 441; McEwen rebuttal,\nTr. at 2912-14; Therriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2868-69.)\n57.  ADC places residents in bed immediately after they have\neaten, a practice which increases the risk of reflux, choking and\naspiration.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 405; Drews, Tr. at\n1245-1246.)  This practice, euphemistically termed \"bedroom\n-  19  -\n\nleisure\" by ADC (See Therriault. rebuttal, Tr. at 2884), is\nmedically inappropriate and serves no legitimate medical or\nprogramming purpose and is a substantial departure from accepted\nprofessional standards.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 403-05.)\n5S.  Significant measures have been taken within the last\nyear to address the seating/positioning needs of residents as\nthey relate to feeding.  (Payne, Tr. at 955-56; Hyman, Tr. Vol.\nIV at 679-85; See Ex. 53-57, 327.)  A number of facility-wide\nchanges related to staff position while feeding, portion control,\npace of feeding, increased individualization of feeding\ntechniques, increased use of appropriate adaptive equipment, and\nimproved positioning of residents through changes in adaptive\nseating systems, has resulted in some reduction in inappropriate\nfeeding practices.  (Drews, Tr. at»1240-43; Hinkle, Tr. at\n2033-38.)  However, dangerous feeding practices at ADC are still\nlife-threatening and result in harm to residents.  (Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 403-05; Therriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2869.)\n59.  Even though some of ADC residents have feeding\nprograms, there are too few properly trained staff to effectively\nimplement the programs.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1237-38; Hyman,\nTr. Vol. Ill at 408-12; Therriault, Tr. Vol. V at 1034-36; McEwen\nrebuttal, Tr. at 2910-14; Hyman video rebuttal Ex. 441; .\nTherriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2868-78.)\n- 20 -\n\n60.  With the recent staff increase at ADC, there are now\ntwo full-time swallowing therapists, both speech pathologists.\n(Andreas, Tr. at 1086; Hinkle, Tr. at 2032.)  There are also\nthree full-time speech pathologists who function part-time as\nswallowing therapists and three occupational therapists (two\npart-time) who function as swallowing therapists a portion of\neach day and a part-time feeding therapist consultant.  (Hinkle,\nTr. at 2032-33.)  The swallowing therapist's dual role is to\nprovide direct feeding-related services and to act as case\nmanagers to ensure that the components of the dysphagia\nmanagement system are coordinated to meet the multi-disciplinary\nneeds of the residents.  (See Andreas, Tr. at 1052-58, 1069-71.)\nBoth direct and consultative services are being provided by\nWilliam Hinkle, Ph.D.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 431; Hyman, Tr.\nVol. IV at 664, 672; Andreas, Tr. tit 957.)\n61.  Following an initial facility-wide screening to\nprioritize at-risk individuals (Hinkle, Tr. at 2013), three basic\nmethods now result in a resident's entry into the\nfeeding/swallowing management system: referrals from staff and\nthe team process; the swallowing therapist's systematic review of\nall dining plans in all living units; and evaluation at the time\nof each resident's annual staffing.  (Hinkle, Tr. at 2013-15,\n2019; Andreas, Tr. at 1052.)  Newly developed dining plans exist\nfor many residents and the process is on-going.  (Hinkle, Tr. at\n2018-19.)\n- 21 -\n\n62.  However, these newly developed resident \"dining plans,\"\nwhich indicate that individual, staff members have been trained to\nimplement individual feeding programs, contain multiple\nirregularities and staff give inconsistent statements about the\ntraining they have actually received.  Some staff admitted they\nhad not been trained, and even those that said they had received\ntraining did not follow the practices listed in the plans as they\nfed residents.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 410-13; Therriault, Tr.\nVol. V at 1020-22, 1029-36; McEwen rebuttal, Tr. at 1920-12;\nTherriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2870-72; and Hyman, video rebuttal\nEx. 441.)\n63.  Sufficient numbers of adequately trained staff are not\navailable at Arlington to monitor residents at mealtimes (Hyman,\nTr. Vol. Ill at 464, 469, 489) and*while the residents are in\npostural drainage.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 492; Hyman, video\nrebuttal Ex. 441.)\n64.  Defendants' use of postural drainage at Arlington\n(i.e.  placing residents in a head down position for long periods\nf\nof time unattended) is dangerous and subjects residents to\nsubstantial risk of harm.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 492-94.)\n65.  Defendants fail to provide proper medical management of\nresidents with feeding-related disorders and illnesses, including\ndysphagia, reflux and respiratory illnesses associated with\n- 22 -\n\naspiration and reflux.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 429-30.)\nDefendants' failure to properly diagnose and treat these\ndisorders has harmed residents and continues to harm residents\nand place residents at unreasonable risk of harm.  (Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 429-35.)\n66.  Although fully apprised of these dangerous practices by\nthe United States on a number of different occasions, Defendants\nfailed to take sufficient steps to eliminate them.  (Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 435.)  Defendants' failure to act, even upon their\nown consultants' recommendations, has resulted in residents\nsuffering unnecessary illnesses and even death.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol.\nIll at 445-50, 478-80.)\n67.  At least 28 residents have died from aspiration or\nreflux related causes within the last six years, and in many of\nthese cases inadequate and improper care and medical treatment\ndirectly contributed to the continuing ill health and deaths of\nthese residents.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 450-60, 463-65, 469-71,\n476-91.)\n- 23 -\n\nVision, Hearing and Communication\n68.  Defendants fail to adequately provide for the visual,\nhearing and communication needs of the residents, (Christian, Tr.\nVol. II at 159), preventing or at least significantly limiting\nresidents with these needs from benefitting from any educational,\nbehavior modification, or social affective programs or any other\ntraining or programming.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol. IV at 788-90.)\nAcute and Chronic Seizure Management\n69.  The management of residents with chronic seizures is a\nsubstantial departure from professionally accepted clinical\npractice.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 388-89, 501, 507, 546-47.)\nDefendants do not properly monitor*and treat ADC residents with\nseizure disorders.  ADC keeps residents on anticonvulsants they\nno longer need, keeps them on sub-therapeutic or potentially\ntoxic levels of medication for months (and in some cases, a year\nor more) with no rationale documenting the efficacy of this for\nthe residents involved.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 501-74.)\n70.  Residents who have not had seizures for over six years\nare kept on one or more anticonvulsant, exposing them to the\npotentially harmful side effects of these medications, with no\ndocumentation as to why such medication has been continued and\nwithout plans to reduce the number of medications.  (Hyman, Tr.\n- 24 -\n\nVol. Ill at 503-10.)  ADC fails to monitor blood levels to ensure\nthat medication levels are appropriate.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill\nat 512-28, 530-38.)\n71.  ADC does not adequately track seizures and seizure\nmedication to ensure that a record is maintained of each seizure.\nProper tracking is necessary to ensure appropriate use of\"\nmedication.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 502-03; Therriault, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 1641-43; Hyman rebuttal Tr. at 2892, 2896.)\n72.  Although many residents are maintained on one\nanticonvulsant medication (monotherapy), some residents are\ninappropriately maintained on more than one anticonvulsant\nmedication (polypharmacy) for years without requisite plans to\nreduce the number of medications. •» (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 504,\n530, 534-41.)  In several cases where monotherapy has been\nrecently attempted and has failed (i.e., in some cases one\nmedication is not sufficient to control the individuals'\nseizures), ADC physicians have failed to recognize the\nlimitations of monotherapy for these residents and have continued\nto leave them on one anticonvulsant despite significant increases\nin these residents' seizures once monotherapy began, resulting in\nharm to these residents.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 518-20, 541-43,\n545-47, 571-72.)\n- 25 -\n\n73.  Defendants' emergency response and medical treatment of\nacute seizure events is grossly inadequate.  For example, ADC\nmedical staff continue to treat status epilepticus, a condition\nwith a high rate of morbidity and mortality, with intra-muscular\n(I.M.) medications —  a practice soundly rejected by the.medical\nprofession.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 547-48, 550-51, 556,\n566-71.)  In one case,, a higher-functioning, 15 year-old was\ntreated with only I.M. valium during a three hour seizure.  The\ninappropriate treatment resulted in severe, irreversible brain\ndamage.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 551-66.)\n74.  ADC physicians have inadequate experience with and lack\nof basic knowledge of both chronic and acute seizure management,\nand fail to properly utilize outside consultants, resulting in\nharm to residents and placing residents at substantial risk of\nharm.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 534, 542, 573-78.)\nMedication Use and Monitoring\n75.  Defendants' failures to prescribe medications\nappropriately, to adequately monitor blood levels, and to\nrecognize and monitor harmful side effects is a substantial\ndeparture from accepted judgment, practice, or standards and has\nharmed residents and continues to harm residents and place them\nat substantial risk of harm.  (Hyman, Tr. at 580-87; Hyman, Tr.\nVol. IV at 597-02, 604-13; Hyman, video rebuttal Ex. 441.)\n- 26 -\n\n76.  Various medications, medical procedures, and their\neffects are not understood or appreciated by ADC's medical staff.\nFor example, the blood level of one resident was not monitored\nappropriately and she died of theophylline toxicity.  (Hyman, Tr.\nat vol. Ill at 597-02.)  Another resident was given four.enemas\nin a 12 hour period and subsequently died from the effects of a\nhigh sodium level caused by the enema solution.  (Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 582-86.)  Another resident was maintained on a toxic\nlevel of a psychotropic, stelazine, resulting in serious physical\nand behavioral side effects, and perhaps contributing to his\nchoking to death because of the drug's known effect to increase\nappetite and decrease swallowing and gagging reflexes.  (Hyman,\nTr. Vol. IV at 604-13.)\nOrthopedic Management\n77.  Defendants fail to provide timely and accurate\ndiagnoses and treatment for acute orthopedic trauma, as well as\nfor chronic and progressive orthopedic disorders, resulting in\nresidents suffering unnecessary pain, disfigurement and loss of\nmobility and function.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. IV at 619-20, 632-33,\n637-47.)\n78.  Defendants misdiagnose fractures and fail to diagnose\nthem in a timely fashion.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. IV at 645, 647.)\n- 27 -\n\nTraining and Response to Medical Emergencies\n79.  Staff training for and responses to medical emergencies\nat ADC are grossly inadequate, have harmed residents and continue\nto place residents at an unreasonable risk of harm.  (Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 441-44, 464, 469-70, 552-56; Hyman, video rebuttal\nEx. 441.)\nPeer Review, Including Mortality Review\n80.  Defendants' investigations of injuries, abuse\nallegations and deaths are perfunctory, and rarely result in any\ncorrective action.  The causes or circumstances of an inordinate\nnumber of serious incidents, injuries, and deaths are unknown and\nunexplained.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill*at 558-66; Vol. IV at 602,\n613; Christian, Tr. Vol. I at 97, 99; Rol. Palmer, Vol. VII at\n1390-91; Reb. Palmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1433-41.)\nMedical Staffing and Use of Consultants\n81.  There are too few adequately trained and supervised\nmedical personnel at ADC.  (Hyman, Tr. at 410-12, 418, 435, 480;\nChristian, Tr. Vol. I at 48, 72, 127; Christian, Tr. Vol. II at\n257.)\n- 28 -\n\n82.  Defendants fail to employ or utilize needed medical\nconsultants, (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 578), and, in those cases\nwhere they do seek consultants' recommendations, they do not act\nupon them quickly, if at all.  (Hyman, Tr. Vol. Ill at 448-49;\nHyman, Tr. Vol. IV at 648-49.)\nDocumentation\n83.  Defendants' documentation of medical diagnoses,\ntreatment, and follow-up for individual residents, as well as\nDefendants' statistical reports, are grossly inadequate (Hyman,\nTr. Vol. Ill at 447-49, 453, 481-83, 514-15), and often\ninaccurate, and have harmed residents, and continue to harm\nresidents and place them at unreasonable risk of harm.  (Hyman,\nTr. Vol. Ill at 508-09.)  •»'\n84.  The nurses at Arlington, though, who act as \"gate\nkeepers\" for the physicians, are generally not doing an adequate\njob of placing into the resident charts the information needed by\nthe physicians in order to exercise their professional judgment.\n(Hyman, Tr. at 502.)\nCommunity Placement\n85.  None of the medical staff at ADC are charged with or\nare taking the responsibility to evaluate or coordinate resident\n- 29 -\n\ndischarges into the community in light of their potential medical\nneeds.  (McLemore, Tr. at 1898-1905.)  Although community\nplacement may be appropriate for residents of ADC and may serve\nto foster the resident's growth and development, Defendants'\nplacement process or ^dumping\" does not reflect the exercise of\nprofessional judgment.\nDEFENDANTS ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE\nADEQUATE PSYCHIATRIC 8ERVICE3 FOR RESIDENTS\n86.  Defendants are failing to provide adequate psychiatric\nservices because ADC cannot provide accurate and reliable\ninformation upon which a psychiatrist may base treatment\ndecisions, including the use of psychotropic drugs.  (Christian,\nTr. at 2761.)\n87.  Since the addition of Dr. Horwitz in October, 1992, and\nthe contract with Dr. Levine in the summer of 1993, Arlington has\nbeen providing psychiatric care to its residents through the\nservices of two psychiatrists, who are employed by Arlington as\nconsultants.  (Horowitz, Tr. at 1342; Levine, Tr. at 1601.)\nHowever, defendants still fail, inter alia, to implement\nprofessionally designed training programs, to recognize and\nconduct proper assessments of residents needing psychological\nservices, to train staff, and to have sufficient numbers of\ntrained staff (both professional and direct care).  (Christian,\n- 30 -\n\ngenerally and Tr. Vol. I at 48; Christian, Tr. Vol. II at 262;\nChristian rebuttal, Tr. at 2761, 2766-68.)\n88.  Integration of psychiatry into interdisciplinary team\napproaches to the provision of services to persons with mental\nretardation has been the practice in the field of mental\nretardation for over twenty years.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol. IV at\n809, 811-12; See Ex. 349.)\n89.  Persons with mental retardation have the same mental\nhealth needs as persons without mental retardation —  but more\nintense due to their deficits and their dependence on others.\n(Szymanski, Tr. Vol. IV at 768.)  At ADC, psychiatric\nrecommendations for residents are not made as part of a program\ndeveloped by an interdisciplinary team, which is necessary for\nsuch psychiatric care to be appropriate or meaningful.\n(Szymanski, Tr. Vol. IV at 809, 811-12.)\n90.  Severe behavior disorders in individuals.with mental\nretardation may be treated without medication and should only be\ntreated with medication if there is evidence that the behavior\nrelates to an underlying mental disease.  In addition, behavioral\ntraining is required even if a person is receiving medication for\na severe behavior disorder.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol. V at 830.)\n- 31 -\n\n91.  Defendants use psychotropic medications without\nadequate justification of the effectiveness or necessity for such\ndrugs.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol. V at 891-92.)\n92.  Psychiatrists prescribe psychotropic and other\npotentially dangerous medications for ADC residents without the\nopportunity to conduct, complete examinations and assessments of\nresidents due to severe time limitations.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol.\nIV at 784-85; Szymanski, Tr. Vol. V at 830-32, 836-37, 842.)\n93.  Defendants' fail to obtain information necessary to\nprovide mental health services at ADC, e.g.. psychiatric history,\ninitial diagnostic assessment, and etiological acquisition.\n(Szymanski, Tr. Vol. IV at 784, 838, 842.)\n>\n94.  Accurate and reliable data is necessary to determine\nthe efficacy of treatments, both psychiatric and behavioral, for\nresidents.  Such data is not kept at ADC.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol.\nVI at 792, 801-02, 806, 810, 812; Vol. V at 861-62; Rol. Palmer,\nTr. Vol. VII at 1326.)\n95.  Defendants fail to provide sufficient psychiatric\nconsultation time to provide necessary psychiatric and mental\nhealth services to residents.  (Szymanski, Tr. Vol. IV at 810;\nSzymanski, Tr. Vol. V at 836.)\n- 32 -\n\n96.  Defendants are failing to provide mental health\nservices for residents who do not display aggressive or\ndisruptive behavior because they only refer for psychiatric\nevaluation those residents who exhibit such behaviors.  (See\nSzymanski, Tr. Vol. V at 810, 836, 841.)\nNURSING SERVICES, INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND\nNUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AT ADC ARE\nINADEQUATE TO MEET THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF RESIDENTS\n97.  Nursing services at ADC, including physical and\nnutritional management services, are a substantial departure from\naccepted judgment, practice or standards, and the lack of these\nservices has contributed to the death of ADC residents and\ncontinues to expose residents to serious risk of harm.\n(TherriaUlt, Tr. Vol. V at 1568-69y 1587, 1589-90, 1620;\nTherriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2886-90, 2892-97, 2902-03.)\n98.  Defendants fail to provide a sufficient number of\nadequately trained nurses to meet the needs of residents.  As a\nresult, nurses consistently fail to identify and respond to the\nhealth care needs of residents, commit a range of medication\nerrors, fail to adequately monitor the health care problems of\nresidents, and fail to coordinate health care activities with\nother institutional professionals.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol. V at\n1016; Vol. VIII at 1644-47.)\n- 33 -\n\n99.  ADC nurses do not identify or evaluate residents\nexperiencing acute events such as vomiting, increased respiratory\nrate or other acute episodes, to determine the etiology of the\nevent or illness.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1591-92,\n1596-1606, 1619-20.)\n100.  ADC nurses do not recognize or react to significant\nchanges in residents' nutritional and medical status.  For\nexample, staff often do not respond in a timely manner to\nsignificant changes in residents' weight or to resident\ndehydration.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1576, 1578, 1582-83,\n1618-19.)\n101.  ADC nurses do not routinely perform ongoing monitoring\nof serious medical conditions, often failing to perform such\nbasic procedures as taking vital signs.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol.\nVIII at 1593-99, 1601, 1695-99; Therriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2891-\n92.)\n102.  ADC nurses often fail to respond to crucial\ninformation provided by other sources which should alert them to\nmedical problems.  As a result, necessary interventions are not\nundertaken.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1598-99, 1617-19;\nTherriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2893.)\n- 34 -\n\n103.  ADC nurses often fail to make themselves aware of the\nresults of medical tests such as laboratory tests, x-rays and\nother information essential to provide adequate nursing and\nmedical care.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1613-17.)\n104.  ADC nurses fail to administer medications in a manner\nconsistent with basic practices, resulting in an unreasonable\nnumber of medication errors.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol. VIII at\n1620-23, 1628, 1630-31, 1641-42; Therriault rebuttal, Tr. at\n2886-87.)\n105.  ADC nurses improperly record medication\nadministration, reporting medications as having been given when\nin fact they were not, and reporting medication as given before\nor well after it was supposed to have been given.  (Therriault,\nTr. Vol. VIII at 1633-40, and rebuttal, Tr. at 2886-87.)\n106.  ADC nurses are not adequately trained in monitoring\ndrug side-effects.  As a result, they often do not.recognize\ntoxic reactions or physical symptoms of side-effects or of an\noverdose.  (Therriault, Tr. Vol. VIII at. 1604-05, 1643-44, and\nrebuttal, Tr. at 2896-97.)\n107.  ADC nurses do not act to ensure that residents are\nprotected from unnecessary skin breakdowns.  As a consequence,\nresidents unnecessarily develop skin disorders that could have\n- 35 -\n\nbeen avoided with appropriate nursing intervention.  (Therriault,\nTr. Vol. VIII at 1648-51; Therriault rebuttal, Tr. at 2889.)\nPhysical Therapy (PT) Services are Seriously Deficient:\n108.  Physical therapists with particular experience and\nexpertise with individuals with significant developmental\ndisabilities have been utilized on a consulting basis to provide\ntraining to Arlington's physical therapists in a number of core\nareas.  (Payne, Tr. at 948.)  Training for both physical\ntherapists and P.T. technicians in the specialized field of\nadaptive seating has been provided through the wheelchair clinics\nheld at Arlington by contracted seating specialists.  (Payne, Tr.\nat 956-57.)  The physical therapists train direct care staff on\nbody mechanics, transfer techniques/ positioning, range of\nmotion, and, with the P.T. technicians, wheelchair positioning.\n(Payne, Tr. at 959-60, 961-62.)\n109.  This physical therapy training, however, has been\ninsufficient.  Many residents are not properly positioned,\nprovided adequate equipment, including wheelchairs, and provided\nadequate physical therapy intervention due to lack of a\nsufficient number of qualified staff.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI\nat 1128-29.)\n- 36 -\n\n110.  The physical therapy staff at Arlington consists of\nfour full-time registered physical therapists, six full-time\nphysical therapy technicians, and two physical therapist\nassistant positions.  (Ex. 247.)\n111.  Under ADC's new system for identification of physical\ntherapy needs of the resident, each new admission is evaluated by\na registered physical therapist and, if a physical therapy\nprogram is determined to be needed, it is developed by a\nregistered physical therapist and formally reviewed annually.\nEach resident's program is also monitored by their assigned\nphysical therapist on a monthly basis.  Whether or not a resident\nhas a physical therapy program, an interim evaluation will be\nconducted by a physical therapist upon referral by any of the\nother disciplines who work with that resident.  (Payne, Tr. at\n912-16.)\n112.  However, even in light of this recently instituted\nprogram, defendants are not providing physical therapy services\nto all residents who need them, and the services provided are\ngrossly inadequate.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1128-29.)\n113.  Many ADC residents have severe neuromotor impairments,\ncerebral palsy, and other neuro-muscular deficits.  (McEwen, Tr.\nVol. VI at 1113.)  They require adequate physical therapy\nservices to help them move more easily and efficiently, to help\n- 37 -\n\navoid contractures, deformities, acute curvature of the spine due\nto scoliosis, and to permit them to learn functional skills to\nenhance their independence.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1114-17.)\n114.  An acceptable physical therapy program must enhance\nthe capacity of the individual to function, i.e.. to help him or\nher to live safely and as independently as possible:  Sporadic\npassive range of motion \"therapy11 is not sufficient to achieve\nthese goals.  Muscles need to be stretched for prolonged periods\nthroughout the day.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1118-22.)\n115.  Defendants are not adequately assessing all ADC\nresidents to determine their need for physical therapy services.\n(McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1128-29, 1243-44.)\n•»\n116.  PT evaluations, physical management plans,\ninterventions, staffing, staff training, the \"school based\"\nphysical therapy program and quality assurance are all a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment,\npractice or standards.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1128-30, 1159-63,\n1175-80, 1230-34, 1243-46, 1248-53; McEwen, Tr. Vol. VII at\n1268-71.)\n117.  ADC's failure to provide adequate physical therapy\nservices has precluded residents from developing functional\nskills, being placed in more \"normal\" environments, and has\n- 38 -\n\ncaused residents to suffer increased deformities and\ncontractures.  Such deformities have posed direct threats to\ntheir health.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1129-30.)\n118.  Many of the contractures, deformities, and loss of\nmobility and other functional skills suffered by ADC residents\ncould have been reduced or avoided if ADC had provided adequate\nPT and occupational therapy (OT) services to ADC residents.\n(McEwen, Tr. Vol. VII at 1283-84.)\n119.  Defendants' failure to adequately assess residents is\ndue, in part, to a lack of sufficient number of trained PT staff\nto individually evaluate each resident of ADC to determine his or\nher need for such services.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1252-61.)\n•»\n120.  ADC's physical therapy staff lack sufficient expertise\nto properly evaluate residents for their physical therapy needs,\nincluding wheelchair and alternative positioning, intervention\nprograms that promote development of motor skills that will\nenhance functional independence, and programs that will assist\nresidents in achieving IHP and IEP objectives.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol.\nVI at 1252-61.)\n121.  ADC's physical therapy is so deficient that passive\nrange of motion and/or passive positioning are the primary\ninterventions provided.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1129-30, 1159,\n- 39 -\n\n1182.)  Overall the emphasis is on maintenance, rather than\nacquisition of functional motor skills.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI\nat 1179-81.)  Such a deficient level of PT services subjects the\nresidents to harm.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1129-30.)\n122.  Defendants do not provide appropriate and necessary\nadaptive equipment to ADC residents who need such equipment,\nalthough the defendants have begun to provide this equipment.\n(McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1190-91, 1193-94, 1227-28.)\n123.  ADC does not properly assess and treat acute\northopedic disorders.  ADC does not provide needed orthopedic\ndevices, e.g., braces, splints, and body jackets, subjecting\nresidents to unnecessary risks for further deformities and\ninappropriate body growth.  ADC's fTs do not sufficiently refer\nresidents for consultations or other treatments, or follow-up\nresidents who have pain that interferes with proper positioning\nand motor skills such as standing and walking.  These failures\nlead to loss of skills and increased deformities.  (McEwen, Tr.\nVol. VI at 1187-88, 1219-20; Hyman, Tr. Vol. IV at 619-23,\n632-33,. 637-40.)\n124.  Some ADC residents are placed in wheelchairs that are\nnot designed for their individual needs, e.g., they have, sling\nseats and backs and elevating footrests, or lack essential parts,\n- 40 -\n\ne.g.. footrests.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1193-97, 1208-11, 1219,\n1225-26.)\n125.  Many ADC residents are often improperly positioned in\nwheelchairs or other adaptive equipment.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI\nat 1187-88, 1209-11, 1220-22, 1230, 1235-39.)  This improper\npositioning can cause contractures, deformities and pain, can\ninterfere with eating and digestion, and can even cause\nasphyxiation.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1116-17, 1235; Hyman, Tr.\nVol. Ill at 405.)\n126.  There are still residents who ADC has identified as\nneeding new wheelchairs who do not have them and others who have\nnot yet been identified by ADC as needing them in spite of\nobvious deficiencies in their present seating.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol.\nVII at 1227-28.)\n127.  Residents are often improperly positioned because\nthere are too few staff present to monitor residents or the staff\non duty lack the training to position residents properly.\n(McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1206-10, 1223-27; McEwen, Tr. Vol. VII at\n1312-13.)\n128.  Occupational therapy services at ADC are also\ninadequate, in part due to inadequately trained occupational\ntherapy staff.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VII at 1277-82.)\n- 41 -\n\n129-  Due to the lack of adequate physical and occupational\ntherapy services, the health of ADC residents has deteriorated.\n(McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1129-30.)\n130.  Although the new Director of Therapeutic Services has\ninitiated a revised physical therapy evaluation format (Payne,\nTr. at 918-27), the revised assessment procedures are still\ninadequate and residents continue to lack physical management\nplans.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1169-74, 1230-34, 1243-47.)\n131.  Notwithstanding Defendants' claims that improvements\nhave been made in physical therapy services, any such\nimprovements have not remedied constitutional deficiencies in FT\nservices.  (McEwen, Tr. Vol. VI at 1129-30, 1233-34, 1248-53.)\nEDUCATION SERVICES TO SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN\nMEET THE REOUTR'PiH.fciNTS OF THE\nINDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT\n132.  Of the 56 school age Arlington (ADC) residents, 49\npresently receive their education on the ADC campus.  The number\nof school age residents is expected to drop to 48 and the total\nADC student body will number 34.  (Hansen, Tr. at 2195-97.)\n133.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq., assures all handicapped\n42 -\n\nchildren of a \"free appropriate public education.\"  20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1400(c).\n134.  Arlington's educational program is carried on in five\nclassrooms - two in the \"school area\" with an additional room for\nmusic  and three in the Baker Building for more physically\nr\ninvolved students.  (Hansen, Tr. at 2200-02.)\n135.  Four certified special education teachers are on the\nArlington staff.  A certified substitute is also currently on the\nstaff, along with 12 teacher assistants, numerous foster\ngrandparents, a principal who oversees the program and an\neducational consultant.  (Hansen, Tr. at 2197-2200.)\n136.  Teachers receive in-seryice and on-the-job training in\nnumerous areas.  (Hansen, Tr. at 2213-15.)\n137.  Defendants, however, are failing to provide special\neducation and related services sufficient to meet the unique\nneeds of the school-age children at ADC.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol.\nVTI at 1513-15; Vol. VIII at 1527-28.)  Further, educational\nservices are not being provided in the least restrictive\nenvironment.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1523-24.)\n138.  Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) developed at ADC\nare inadequate because, inter alia, ADC's assessments of children\n- 43 -\n\nare incomplete and inappropriate.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII\nat 1472-75.)\n139.  ADC's assessments of children fail to contain an\nadequate statement of the students' present level of performance\nor sufficiently describe the abilities and needs of students.\n(Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VTI at 1474-75.)\n140.  ADC does not provide sufficiently comprehensive\ntraining objectives in their IEPs to meet students' needs.  IEPs\ndo not seek to promote the development of new skills.\n(Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII at 1474-87.)\n141.  The skills identified as goals for many students in\nIEPs are not functional, i.e.. the, skill to be learned bears\nlittle relationship to activities of daily living.  (Thibadeau,\nTr. Vol. VII at 1477-79.)\n142.  The goals identified in the IEPs are often not related\nto one another and are often unduly repetitious.  (Thibadeau, Tr.\nVol. VII at 1479-87.)\n143.  ADC does not take steps to ensure that skills learned\nin the classroom are maintained or generalized to non-classroom\nsettings.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII at 1502-04.)\n- 44 -\n\n144.  ADC has not consistently developed goals in IEPs for\nthe requisite one year period and multiple goals are written for\nthe same skill.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII at 1487-89.)  Goals\nwritten for students are too narrow, too limited in their scope\nand tend to assume children lack the capacity to grow, learn and\ndevelop.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII at 1478-87.)\n145.  ADC does not have an adequate recordkeeping system in\nplace to appropriately monitor the educational status of\nstudents.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII at 1489-92, 1494-501.)\n146.  Teaching staff at ADC do not provide adequate and\nappropriate interactions with students.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII\nat 1504, 1508-10.)\n•»\n147.  Related services, including, but not limited to,\nphysical therapy, behavioral training, and speech and language\nservices provided by ADC are inadequate to allow children to\nbenefit from special education services as required by the IDEA.\n(Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VII at 1513-16; Vol. VIII at 1523.)\n148.  Although recent steps have been taken to provide\nchildren with educational services within the Shelby County\nPublic School system, school-aged children remain at ADC who\ncould more appropriately benefit from receiving educational\nservices outside ADC and are therefore not being educated in the\n- 45 -\n\nleast: restrictive environment as required by the IDEA.\n(Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1523-26.)  In addition, transitional\nservices designed to facilitate students' integration into post\nschool-age settings are inadequate.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VIII\nat 1523-26, 1528.)\n149.  Notwithstanding Defendants' claims that improvements\nhave recently been made in educational services, any such\nimprovements have not remedied deficiencies in ADC's educational\nprogram.  (Thibadeau, Tr. Vol. VIII 1524-26.)\nDEFENDANTS HAVE NOT INITIATED REMEDIAL\nACTION TO CORRECT IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES\n150.  The Defendants failed to begin remedial measures, even\non life-threatening issues, until after the actual filing of a\nlawsuit in this case, even though state officials were informed\nas early as July 1990 that life-threatening conditions existed at\nADC.  In fact, some efforts undertaken by defendants did not\noccur until after the United States filed for a preliminary\ninjunction in March of 1993.  (See Hyman, Tr. Vol. IV at\n650-651.)\n151.  ADC has demonstrated resistance and indifference to\ncorrective action.  Testimony of former employees and parents of\nresidents indicated that many staff do not know residents or\ntheir needs, do not speak to them, hug the children, or even sit\n- 46 -\n\non their furniture.  There was substantial evidence that\nemployees who entered the institution with the best of intentions\nwere repeatedly rebuked when they tried to implement necessary,\nbasic, and fundamental improvements.  Indeed, various employees\nfailed to cooperate with former employees' legitimate requests\nfor cooperation and implementation of programs, even in life-\nthreatening situations.  Parents likewise repeatedly testified\nthat institutional officials failed to cooperate with their\nreasonable requests for assistance, including requests for\nservices, investigations into alleged abuse, and even basic\ninformation about their children.  (Nuckolls, Tr. Vol. VI at\n1057, 1059-64, 1066-68, 1070-71; Davis, Tr. Vol. IX 1788-1793;\nTucker, Tr. Vol. IX 1820-25, 1828-1831; Rol. Palmer, Tr. Vol. VII\nat 1354-56, Ex. 89, and generally.)\nv\n152.  There have been unexplained and suspicious\nirregularities in employee statements to the United States'\nexperts and in records provided by the Defendants, such as claims\nby staff to have been trained when not so trained, data obviously\ndocumented long after the event recorded occurred, documentation\nshowing data taken when in fact it was not, and obviously\nunauthorized and/or forged signatures on documents.  (Hyman,\nTr. Vol. Ill at 410-412; Therriault, Tr. Vol. V at 1029-1039;\nTherriault, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1632-37, 1639-40; Thibadeau,\nTr. Vol. VII at 1497-1502; Reb. Palmer Test.).\n- 47 -\n\n152.  In the past and during a number of recent DOJ tours,\nADC put on a \"show11 and/or visits were staged for the experts or\nothers touring.  (Christian rebuttal, Tr. at 2765-69; Rol.\nPalmer, Tr. Vol. VII at 1366-67.)\n153.  Defendants fail to monitor resident property to\nprotect it from theft and many ADC residents have lost\nunreasonable amounts of personal property.

Civil Action\nNo.  92-2062 Ml/A\nSTATE'OF TENNESSEE,\nDon Sundquist, Governor of the\nState of Tennessee; Marjorie\nNelle Cardwell, Commissioner,\nTennessee Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation;\nMax Jackson, Superintendent,\nArlington Developmental Center,\nDefendants.\nCONTEMPT ORDER\nOn August 9, 1995, the Court held a hearing on the United\nStates Third Motion for Contempt and on the status of defendants'\ncompliance with the Court's orders of June 3 0 and July 10, 1995.\nAfter hearing the evidence presented by both parties and the\nCourt Monitor's expert, the Court found defendants in contempt of\nthe Court's orders and issued contempt sanctions in order to\ncompel compliance and remedy the crisis in care at the Arlington\nDevelopmental Center  (\"ADC\").\nThe history of this case amply demonstrates that the\ndefendants have been given every opportunity to take appropriate\ncorrective action and have continually failed to do so.  Unlike\nthe consequences of a party's failure to act in many other civil\non dockat ^heei in compliance v/ith Iluis 53 aad/c:\n\ncases,  the  defendants'  inaction  in  this  case  directly  impacts on\nthe  immediate  health  and  safety  of  individual  citizens.  The\ndocumentary  and oral  evidence  at  the  hearings  on June  30,  July\n10,  and August  9,  1995,  and the  entire  record  in  this  case\ndemonstrate,  by clear  and  convincing  evidence,  that  the\ndefendants  violated  the  Court's  orders  of  June  30 and July  10,\n1995.m  As set  out  in  this  memorandum and  its  attachments,\ndefendants  have  failed  to  marshal  their  resources  to  achieve\ncompliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Emergency  Order  of  June  30,\n1995 and the  Injunction  of  July  10,  1995.\nThe Arlington  Developmental  Center  is  a  state  operated,\nresidential  mental  retardation  facility  housing  approximately  385\ndevelopmentally  disabled  persons  located  in  Arlington,  Tennessee.\nADC's population  consists  primarily  of  individuals  currently\nassessed  as  severely  or  profoundly  retarded  or  developmentally\ndisabled,  some of  whom have  associated  physical  handicaps,\nmedical  problems,  or  behavior  problems.  In  1991, ADC was  the\nsubject  of  a United  States  Department  of  Justice  (\"DOJ\")\ninvestigation  of  possible  statutory  and  constitutional  violations\nregarding  its  resident  population.  A DOJ findings  letter  citing\ndeficiencies  was issued  to  the  state  of  Tennessee  in  1991.  On\n111  The plaintiff  also  established  by clear  and convincing evidence that  the\ndefendants  violated  the  Remedial Order of  September 2,  1994,  and the\nPlan of  Correction of  April  10,  1995.  See n.  8 supra.  The standard  for\ncivil  contempt  applied  in  this  case  is  set  out  in Glover v.  Johnson. 934\nF.2d  703,  707-08  (6th Cir.  1991)  (clear  and convincing evidence that  the\ndefendant  violated  the  Court's  prior  order).  See NLRB v.  Cincinnati\nBronze,  Inc.,  829 P.2d  585,  590  (6th Cir.  1987).\n\nJanuary 21, 1992, after the state of Tennessee refused to comply\nwith the DOJ findings letter, the United States of America filed\nsuit against the state of Tennessee and Arlington Developmental\nCenter pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons\nAct (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et sea.  Trial began in this case\non August 30, 1993.\nOn November 22, 1993, the Court issued its oral opinion,\nfinding that conditions at ADC were in violation of the\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of the citizens\nliving there, and issued a preliminary injunction directing\ndefendants to take \"immediate\" action to correct several life-\nthreatening deficiencies.  In its opinion, the Court noted there\nwas proof in support of the United States contention that\ndefendants' resistance to taking meaningful, voluntary corrective\naction was so pronounced as to be deliberate (Opinion at 27), and\nspecifically found in its Supplemental Findings of Fact that:\nDefendants failed to begin remedial measures, even on  life-\nthreatening issues, until after the actual filing of a\nlawsuit in this case, even \"though state officials were\ninformed as early as July 1990 that life-threatening\nconditions existed at ADC.  In fact, some efforts undertaken\nby defendants did not occur until after the United States\nfiled for a preliminary injunction in March of 1993.\n. . . ADC has demonstrated resistance and indifference to\ncorrective action.\n(Findings at 46 f 150 and f 151.)\n\nDespite these findings, the Court gave defendants an\nopportunity to craft their own remedial plan —  rather than have\nsuch a plan dictated by the Court.  Defendants' remedial plan was\nto be submitted to the Court by January 21, 1994.  (Preliminary\nInjunction Order, November 22, 1993.)  On December 23, 1993, the\nCourt, while noting that \"conditions at [ADC] require that the\nState\"of Tennessee proceed promptly with preparation of the\nremedial plan,\" nevertheless, granted defendants' request for an\nextension until February 18, 1994, to submit their plan.  (Order\non Defendants' Motion for an Extension of Time, December 22, 1993\nat 1-2.)  On February 18, 1994, defendants submitted a remedial\nplan that was inadequate, and the defendants moved for and were\ngranted permission to submit a Supplemental Remedial Plan by\nMarch 21, 1994.  See Order of February 24, 1994.  Defendants\nsubmitted this Supplemental Remedial Plan on March 18, 1994.  The\nUnited States objected to the inadequacy of the Plan.  After\nreviewing the Plan and hearing testimony from the parties, the\nCourt ruled at the March 21, 1994 hearing that this Supplemental\nPlan was also inadequate.  After negotiation with the United\nStates, and with input from the Court's Expert Facilitator, the\nparties submitted a joint Remedial Plan, which was accepted and\n\nentered as the Remedial Order121 by the Court on September 2,\n1994.  Appendix A.\nOn  July  29,  1994,  the  United  States  filed  its  first  Motion\nfor  a Contempt Order,  alleging  that  defendants  had not  complied\nwith  the  Court's  Preliminary  Injunction  issued  November 22,  1993.\nThe  evidence presented  at  a hearing  held  on July  29,  1994,\noverwhelmingly  demonstrated  that  defendants  were  in  contempt of\nthe  Injunction,  and the  Court  so held  in  its  order  of  March 31,\n1995.  Because the  Court  ruled  that  the  Remedial Order  adequately\naddressed  the  concerns  raised  in  the  contempt  petition,  the  Court\ndid  not  issue  contempt  sanctions,  other  than  ordering ADC\nprofessional  staff  to  read  the  Court's  orders  and granting  costs\nto  the  United  States.  (Contempt Order,  March 31,  1995 at  6.)\nPursuant  to  the  Remedial Order,  at  the  end  of  1994,  the\nCourt  Monitor  completed  her  first  semi-annual  review of\n121  A Joint  Motion of  the  United  States  and State  of  Tennessee  for  Entry of\nRemedial Order was filed  on August  31,  1994.  The Remedial Order  is  a\n54-page plan,  comprised  of  19 specific  categories  with numerous\nsubdivisions  and an  integrated  timeline  for  implementation.  Prior  to\nentry,  the  Court  carefully  reviewed  the  proposal  in  its  entirety,  and\ndetermined  that,  if  implemented  as  a whole and  in  accordance  with an\nintegrated  timeline,  conditions  at  Arlington  Developmental  Center  could\nbe brought  into  compliance  with  constitutional  and  statutory\nrequirements.\nThe plan  in  essence  calls  for  the  recruitment  and/or  training  of\nqualified  professionals  and direct  care  staff;  the  development  of\nadequate  planning,  implementation,  self-monitoring,  and  recordation\nprocedures;  implementation  of  a retention  review procedure  to  allow\ndefendants  maximum latitude  in  improving personnel  performance;  and  the\nappointment  of  a monitor  to  evaluate  defendants'  compliance.  Provisions\nof  the  Remedial  Order  deal  with  specific  problems  identified  at  ADC.  It\nshould  be noted  that  each  component  of  the  Remedial Order will  be\neffective  only  if  it  is  implemented  in  light  of  all  of  the  other\ncomponents.  Thus,  in  order  to  successfully  implement  the  Order,  the\ndefendants  must  at  all  times  keep  in  mind how each  component  fits  within\nthe  overall  Remedial Order.  See Appendix A.\n\ndefendants' compliance with the 1993 Preliminary Injunction and\nthe Remedial Order.  The Monitor's Report, which previously had\nbeen commented on by the parties, was presented at a hearing on\nApril 10, 1995, and adopted by the Court. The Court concluded, in\nadopting the monitor's report, that defendants had only complied\nwith five of sixty-six provisions that were to have been\naccomplished at the time of the Monitor's review.  Appendix B.\nThe United States filed its second motion for contempt based upon\nthis identified lack of compliance with the Remedial Order and\nthe 1993 Preliminary Injunction.  Again, rather than order\nsanctions at the time of the hearing, the Court accepted and\nadopted, as an order of the Court, defendants' Plan of Correction\nthat was submitted on April 10, 1995 and subsequently signed by\nthe Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation (\"DMHMR\") and the Superintendent of ADC.  Appendix C.\nDuring a compliance review by Court Monitor occurring the\nweek of June 26, 1995, the Monitor informed the Court and.the\nparties that a medical crisis existed at ADC.  Because of the\nconditions asserted to exist at ADC, the United States and the\ncourt monitor requested an immediate hearing by telephone.  The\nCourt conducted a hearing by telephone with the Monitor, the\nMonitor's medical expert, Dr. Renee Wachtel, and the parties.  At\nthat hearing, Dr. Wachtel testified that two (2) people at ADC\nhad died within the last four (4) days.  (Tr. June 30, 1995 at 28\n\n11.  21-22.)  Dr.  Wachtel  further  testified  that  eleven  (11) ADC\nresidents  had  died  in  the  last  nine  (9)  months  and  that,  when\ncompared  with  other  similar  populations,  that  number  is\n\"excessive,  very  excessive.\"  (Tr.  June  30,  1995  at  28-29.)  Dr.\nWachtel  set  out  in  her  preliminary  report  (Appendix  D)  and\nfurther  testified  on June  30,  1995,  regarding  immediate  critical\nconditions  at  ADC.  See  Tr.  June  30,  1995  at  7-22  (inadequate\ncomprehensive  medical  care,  transfers  of  acutely  ill  patients,\ncritical  physician  shortage,131  absence  of  psychiatric  services,\netc.).  It  was  Dr.  Wachtel's  opinion  that  absent  immediate\naction,  ADC \"will  continue  to  have  unnecessary  deaths.\"  (Tr.\nJune  30,  1995  at  9.)  See  also  Tr.  June  30,  1995  at  21 11.  7-10;\nTr.  June  30,  1995  at  22  11.  12-25;  Tr.  June  30,  1995  at  26  11.  2-\n4;  Tr.  at  28  11.  2-17.w  The  state  of  Tennessee  acknowledged\nthat  the  facts  supporting  the  emergency  conditions  existed  and\nsubstantially  agreed  and/or  acquiesced  in  the  imposition  of  a\nP1  The state  of  emergency  at  ADC arose  in  part  because  of  the  resignation\nor  termination  of  primary  care  physicians  at  Arlington  Developmental\nCenter.  The minimum complement  of  five  (5)  primary  care  physicians\n(including  the  Medical  Director)  had dwindled to  essentially  one  (1)\nprimary  care  provider  plus  the  Medical  Director.  Contract  and/or  loan\nphysicians  were providing  some support  and night  coverage,  but  it  was\nclear  from  information  presented  by Dr.  Wachtel  that  effective  medical\ncare  for  this  population  was collapsing,  (Appendix D),  leading  to  a\nserious  risk  of  severe  or  substantial  harm or  death  for  numerous ADC\nresidents.\nM  The presence  of  a Developmental  Physician  at  ADC is  essential  to\nadequate medical  care  at  the  facility.  Remedial Order  § VI A (September\n2,  1995)  (Appendix A);  Tr.  June  30,  1995  at  26  (Wachtel);  Tr.  June  30,\n1995 at  36-37;  Tr.  June  30,  1995 at  42.  The Developmental  Physician,\nwhom state  representatives  had testified  on April  10,  1995 would be\npresent  in  the  facility  by June  1,  1995,  had declined  employment  with\nthe  state  of  Tennessee.  No contract  documents were ever  presented  as  to\nthat  physician  and there  is  no documentary  evidence  that  an agreement\nwas ever  actually  reached  with  that  physician  for  her  employment.\n\nproposed Emergency Order.  (Tr. June 30, 1995 at 15-16, 30.)\nAfter consideration of the documents before the Court and Dr.\nWachtel's testimony, the Court adopted the proposed Emergency\nOrder, directing the defendants to take various actions to\ncorrect the crisis.  Appendix E.  The Court scheduled a hearing\nfor July 10, 1995 to ensure that defendants had complied with the\nprovisions of the Emergency Order.\nAt the July 10, 1995 hearing, the Court heard evidence\nregarding the deficient medical conditions that existed at ADC\nand the defendants' non-compliance with the Emergency Order.\nThat evidence included testimony by Dr. Akers, the Arlington\nDevelopmental Center Medical Director, who testified on July 10,\n1995, that he had informed Commissioner Cardwell's office several\nmonths in advance of the need to obtain replacement physicians.\n(Tr. July 10, 1995 at 113.)  No action, however, was taken by the\ncentral office.  Moreover, Commissioner Cardwell admitted that as\nof July 10, 1995, a recruiting package had not been prepared for\na developmental physician, (Tr. July 10, 1995 at 92), despite the\nfact that all parties have consistently acknowledged that the\nrecruitment of a developmental physician is critical.  (Tr. June\n30, 1995 at 26, 36-37, 42.)  Based upon the evidence presented,\nthe Court ruled that defendants had failed to comply with the\nEmergency Order and that the requirements of the Emergency Order\nwere still necessary.  The Court incorporated the requirements of\nthe Emergency Order into a preliminary injunction.  (Order of\n8\n\nJuly 21, 1995 (Appendix E).)  Again, rather than order sanctions\nfor defendants' non-compliance, the Court gave defendants another\nopportunity to come into compliance by August 9, 1995, and a\nhearing was set for that date.  Id. at 2.  The Court made it\nclear at the July 10, 1995 hearing that if defendants did not\ncomply by the August 9 hearing date, coercive and remedial\nsanctions might be imposed.  (Tr. July 10, 1995 at 143-44.)\nAt the hearing on August 9, 1995, the defendants put on\ntestimony of Marjorie Nelle Cardwell,151 Tennessee's Commissioner\n151  Commissioner Cardwell is \"the chief executive officer with the state\nresponsible for complying with the terms of the Court's order . . .•\"\n(Tr. April 10, 1995 at 104 11. 17-20.)  She began employment with the\nstate of Tennessee in 1969 as assistant superintendent at Green Valley\nDevelopmental Center, was promoted to assistant superintendent in the\nearly 1970s, and became superintendent at Cloverbottom Developmental\nCenter in 1977.  From 1980 to 1990, she was superintendent at the Green\nValley Developmental Center in East Tennessee.  In August 1990, she was\nappointed assistant commissioner (i.e. assistant to the Director of\nDMHMR) with direct oversight of mental retardation facilities in\nTennessee.  (Trial Tr. September 8, 1993 Vol. VII at 1402.)  She\nremained in that position during the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\")\ninvestigation of the Arlington Developmental Center.  In 1991, she\nreceived and reviewed the DOJ findings letter regarding Arlington.  (Tr.\nApril 10, 1995 at 104-106.)\nThe trial record shows that in June 1991, Cardwell came to Memphis and\nmet with Dr. Roland Palmer, former Psychology Director ADC.  At this\nmeeting, Dr. Palmer reviewed with Cardwell a list of 39 concerns\nregarding conditions at Arlington.  (Trial Tr. September 8, 1993 Vol.\nVII at 1403 and Trial Exh. 96 (Appendix M).)  Prior to his resignation\nfrom Arlington Developmental Center, (Trial Exh. 97) (Appendix N)), Dr.\nRoland Palmer had participated in an in-house ADC investigation and\nreport, which reflected that evidence against Arlington regarding the\nDOJ findings letter was \"overwhelming,\" (Trial Tr. Vol. VII at 1405 1.\n4), and that the state should make the required changes.  (Trial Tr.\nVol. VII at 1405-1407.)  Palmer testified that the report went to\nNashville, including to Cardwell and her superior.  According to Palmer,\n. . . after that report hit Nashville, things got a\nlot different at Arlington ....  Nobody much wanted\nto talk to me much anymore ....  Finally [I was]\ntold . . . that the state had decided to fight the\ndecision [the DOJ findings letter].\n(Trial Tr. Vol. VII at 1406 11. 8-12.)

The\nUnited  States  placed  the  reports  of  Ms.  Therriault  (Appendix K)\nand Dr.  Susan  Hyman  (Appendix  L),  a physician  specializing  in\ndevelopmental  disabilities,  into  evidence.  The reports  of  the\nUnited  States  experts  were based  upon their  tours  of  the\ninstitution  and  reviews  of  documents  prior  to  the  hearing.171  The\nCourt  Monitor's  medical  expert,  Dr.  Renee Wachtel,  also  testified\nbased  upon her  review  of  documents  and her  discussions  with\npersonnel  at  ADC the  day  before  the  hearing.\n(Cont.  from previous  page)  Based on the proof  at trial  and the\ntestimony  of  Commissioner  Cardwell  on April  10,  1995, it  appears  that,\ndespite  her knowledge  of  conditions  at Arlington  while  she was  assistant\ncommissioner  (1990-1993),  the department  did not hire  any experts  to\nprovide  assistance  in  correcting  the deficiencies  listed  by Dr. Roland\nPalmer.  See e.g.  Tr. April  10,  1995 at  108-109;  Trial  Tr.  September 8,\n1993  at  1403-1408.\nOn January  21,  1993, Cardwell  retired  from the State  of  Tennessee.  In\nJanuary  1995, she was appointed  Commissioner  of  the Department  of  Mental\nHealth  and Mental  Retardation  for the state  of  Tennessee.  (Tr. April  10,\n1995  at  105-106.)\n[<l  At several  points  during  defendants'  presentation,  defendants'  witnesses\nor  counsel  for defendants  stated  that  the Assistant  Commissioner of\nDMHMR, Dr. Larry Durbin,  or the Superintendent  of  ADC, Max Jackson,  were\nthe  parties  either  responsible  for ensuring  that  necessary  actions  were\ntaken  or had the  information  as to whether  actions  had been  taken  in\ncompliance  with the Court  orders.

(Hearing  Exhibit  11 and\nHyman's Report  of  August  7,  1995  (Appendix  L).)  Ms. Therriault  toured\nADC on July  31 and August  1,  1995.  (Hearing  Exhibit  10,  Therriault's\nReport  of  August  8,  1995 (Appendix K).)\n10\n\nBased  upon  the  evidence  presented,  the  Court  found  that  the\ndefendants  clearly  had  not  complied  with  five  provisions  of  the\nJune  30,  1995 Emergency  Order/July  21,  1995  Preliminary\nInjunction.181  It  was  indisputable  that  defendants  had  not\ncomplied  with  the  first  and  second  provisions  of  the  Injunction,\nas  no Developmental  Medicine  Physician  had  been  retained  as  of\nthe  date  of  the  hearing,  and  the  crucial  duties  of  that  Physician\nunder  the  Injunction  were  not  being  fulfilled.  See Tr.  August  9,\n1995 at  99-101  (Hansen) ,  157  (Wachtel) .'\"  See also  Remedial\nOrder  § VI A.,  C.  & D.  (Appendix A);  July  21,  1995 Order  f  l\n(Appendix  F)  n.  1.  Similarly,  there  was  little  dispute  that\ndefendants  had  failed  to  retain  the  services  of  a  full-time\npsychiatrist,  as  required  by provision  five  of  the  Injunction.\n181  The United  States  Third Motion for  Contempt alleged  that  defendants were\nin  non-compliance with  not  only the  Emergency Order/Preliminary\nInjunction,  but  the  initial  Remedial Order  and the  Plan of  Correction.\nEvidence was presented,  including various  admissions by defendants'\nwitnesses,  that  supported the  United  States  contention.  For example,\nMs. Hansen testified  that  defendants  were not  in  compliance with  the\nRemedial Order or  the  Plan  of  Correction  (Tr.  Aug.  9,  1995 at  91, 93-95,\n102,  121-123),  and Commissioner Cardwell  agreed that  defendants  were not\nin  compliance with the  Court's  Remedial Order  (Tr.  at  50).  The  findings\nof  the  United  States  and the  Court Monitor's medical experts  concur.\nSee,  e.g..  Tr.  Aug.  9,  1995 at  157-58  (Wachtel);  132  (Therriault);  and\nExhibits  10 and  11 (Reports of  Ms. Therriault  (Appendix K) and Dr.\nHyman)  (Appendix L).  See also  n.  1 infra.  However, this  Court's\ncontempt  finding  and  focus  were on the  immediate medical  crisis\naddressed by the  June 30,  1995 Emergency Order  and the  July  21, 1995\nPreliminary  Injunction.  Thus,  the  Court's  contempt ruling  and sanctions\nare  intended to  ensure that  defendants  promptly comply with  the\nEmergency Order/Preliminary  Injunction  requirements, which are  intended\nto  stabilize  medical  services  and to  put  the  necessary professionals  in\nplace  to  comply with  the  other  court  orders  forthwith.\n191  As noted by the  Court  in  the  July  21,  1995 Preliminary  Injunction,  the\nRemedial Order of  September 2,  1994,  required  defendants  to  have hired a\nDevelopmental Medicine Physician by March 2,  1995.  The June 30,  1995\nEmergency Order required  that  defendants  take  immediate action  to  fill\nthe  position  by July  5,  1995.  When it  became clear  at  the  hearing on\nJuly  10,  1995, that  defendants  had  failed  to  comply with that  deadline,\ndefendants  were given  another  extension until  the  August  9,  1995\nhearing.\n11\n\nSee  Tr.  August  9,  1995  at  144,  157  (Wachtel).  See  also  Remedial\nOrder,  § II.  E.  (Appendix  A);  June  30,  1995  Emergency  Order  5 5\n(Appendix  E).\nProvision  seven  of  the  Injunction  required  defendants  to\ncontract  with  two  Developmental  Nurse  Consultants  by July  14,\n1995.  Commissioner  Cardwell  testified  and  defendants'  counsel\nconfirmed  that  defendants  had  only  signed  memoranda  of\nunderstanding  upon which  they  planned  to  base  contracts.  See  Tr.\nAugust  9,  1995  at  30  (Cardwell);  147  (Maloy).  See  also  Tr.  at\n131  (Therriault)  and  Exhibit  10  (Appendix  K)  at  10.  Defendants\ndid  not  produce  these  memoranda  at  the  hearing.\nUnder  provision  eight  of  the  Injunction,  defendants  were  to\nhave  hired  one hundred  thirty-six  (136)  nurses  by August  8,\n1995.m  The most  nurses  that  defendants  claimed  were  on duty  by\nthe  date  of  the  hearing  were  132.  See  Tr.  August  9,  1995  at  31\n(Cardwell)  (Appendix  K).  See  also  Tr.  at  147  (Wachtel),  131\n(Therriault);  and  Exhibit  10  (Appendix  K)  at  10.\n(101  As noted in the July  21,  1995 Preliminary Injunction, this  was already\nto  have been accomplished under the  Plan of  Correction by July  1,  1995.\nAt the  hearing on July  10,  1995,  Commissioner Cardwell testified  that\ndefendants  had failed to meet the requirement of  136 nurses by July 10,\n1995  (just  as they had missed their  deadline of  July  1,  1995)  and that,\nas  of  July  14,  1995,  the  state would have only  111 nurses.  (Tr.  July\n10,  1995 at  70-71.)  This was,  of  course,  still  25 nurses short of  the\nminimum voluntary staffing  level  agreed to  by the  state  in the April 10,\n1995  Plan of  Corrections II.  C.  1  (Appendix C).\nCommissioner Cardwell also  acknowledged that  at  the  time of  the  first\ncompliance  review,  Arlington Developmental Center had obtained the\nservices  of  only 90 nurses and that  as of  June 30,  1995,  they had\nretained  the  services of  approximately 106 nurses.  (Tr.  July  10,  1995\nat  94.)\n12\n\nAlthough defendants also conceded they were not in\ncompliance with provision six, that provision did not have a\ndeadline and, therefore, defendants were not held in contempt of\nthat requirement.  See Tr. August 9, 1995 at 23-24 (Cardwell).\nAs ordered at the hearing, the defendants now have until August\n23, 1995 to comply with that provision.[U1\nIn the instant case, the language of the District Court in\nAspira of New York. Inc. v. Board of Educ. of New York. 423\nF.Supp. 647, 654 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), is particularly appropriate:\n\"\"  For each of the remaining provisions, the Court found defendants had\ncomplied or the deadline for complying had not expired. It should be\nnoted that although the Court concluded that defendants had minimally\ncomplied with the letter of several provisions, that is all that could\nbe said for defendants' efforts.  For example, in order to demonstrate\ncompliance with provision nine, (requirement pertaining to negotiation\nof written agreements with hospitals within 60 days of the June 30, 1995\nEmergency Order), defendants testified that a memorandum of\nunderstanding was signed with the Regional Medical Center.  (Tr. August\n9, 1995 at 25 (Cardwell).)  (A copy of this memorandum was handed to the\nCourt, but was never entered into evidence by defendants.)  However,\ndefendants conceded that they had only an oral agreement with the Le\nBonheur Hospital and they presented no evidence of agreements with any\nother hospitals that serve ADC residents. (Tr. August 9, 1995 at 26\n(Cardwell); Tr. at 148-149 (Wachtel).)  Moreover, defendants' minimal\nefforts to achieve this \"paper compliance\" have not solved the\nunderlying problems which were the reasons for the provisions in the\nfirst place; namely, cooperation and communication about patient\ntransfers between ADC and these hospitals, and clarification and\noversight of Do Not Resuscitate (\"DNR\") practices for ADC residents sent\nto these hospitals.  See, e.g.,  Tr. June 30, 1995 at 10-11, 20-23\n(Wachtel); Dr. Wachtel's Report Exhibit 1 (Appendix D) at 3, 5; Tr. July\n10, 1995 at 14 (O'Neall).  Dr. Wachtel testified that as of August 9,\n1995, ADC still had not received discharge summaries for seven ADC\nresidents who were transferred from the hospital back to ADC during the\nmonth of July.  (Tr. August 9, 1995 at 153.)  Commissioner Cardwell\ntestified that defendants still had not developed a DNR policy.  (Tr.\nAugust 9, 1995 at 33-34.)  As a consequence, defendants abdicate any\nresponsibility regarding the utilization of DNR orders for ADC\nresidents.  Dr. Wachtel testified that the DNR clause in the memorandum\nof understanding with the Regional Medical Center is not clear and is\ninadequate.  The Court agrees.  Similarly, defendants did retain the\nservices of additional physicians for night coverage in compliance with\nprovision four, but defendants were unclear as to whether they had\nreceived or were to be given adequate training.  (Tr. at 21, 29\n(Cardwell), 118 (Hansen).)\n13\n\nUpon the facts disclosed in this proceeding, defendants\nhave fallen far short of the requisite diligence.  They\nhave neglected to marshal their own resources, assert\ntheir high authority, and demand the results needed\nfrom subordinate persons and agencies in order to\neffectuate the course of action required by the consent\ndecree.  They have allowed deadlines to pass without\nadvance announcements or volunteered explanations,\nawaiting complaints by the plaintiffs before even\ntreating with the court concerning delinquencies.  They\nhave borne with seeming equanimity long periods of\nnonperformance, inadequate performance, or outright\ndefiance. . . . They have displayed an evident sense of\nnonurgency bordering on indifference, contrasting\nvividly with the spurt of activity on the heels of\nplaintiffs' motion for a finding of contempt.\nCompliance, or non-compliance with any injunction must, of\ncourse, be measured in the context of the case in which the order\narose, including the circumstances and conduct causing .the\ncreation of the order and the objective or purpose of the order.\nThe objective of all remedial action in this case, whether that\naction is the Remedial Order itself (Appendix A), the Plan of\nCorrection  (Appendix C), the Emergency Order (Appendix E), or the\nsubsequent Injunction (Appendix F) is the objective stated in the\nfirst paragraph of the stipulated Remedial Order entered\nSeptember 2, 1994.  That paragraph provides in relevant part as\nfollows:\nDefendants are hereby Ordered to take the following\nactions to guarantee the statutory and constitutional\nrights of residents of Arlington Developmental Center\n(ADC).  Defendants shall remedy the constitutional and\nstatutory deficiencies identified in the Supplemental\nFindings of February 18, 1994.\n14\n\nThe defendants'  failure  to  progress  toward  the  overall\nobjective  of  improving  actual  patient  care  and  services  at ADC\nhas  been  the  core  problem  and  subject  of  previous  hearings  and\norders.1121  As previously  noted,  the  central  office  allowed  the\nnumber  of  primary  care  physicians  to  deteriorate  to  a  crisis\nlevel  despite  warnings  by the  ADC Medical  Director  and  the\nSuperintendent.  See Tr.  July  10,  1995 at  110-113  (Akers)\n(informing  superiors  of  physician  shortage  March 1995);\nSuperintendent  Jackson's  February  17,  1995 Memo to  Commissioner\nCardwell  (regarding  \"Pending  Crisis  in  Medical  Coverage\")\n(Appendix G);  Dr.  Wachtel  Preliminary  Report,  June  30,  1995 at  5\n1  (Appendix  D)  (noting  \"Critical  Shortage  of  Physicians  at ADC\").\nThe central  office  failed  to  recruit  critical  medical,  nursing,\nand  other  expertise  essential  to  the  implementation  of  the  agreed\nupon  orders  in  this  case.  See Tr.  July  10,  1995 at  114-115\n(Akers);  Dr.  Wachtel  Preliminary  Report,  June  30,  1995  (Appendix\nD);  Hyman report  August  7,  1995  (Appendix  L).  As recently  as  the\nbeginning  of  August  1995,  the  Commissioner  acknowledged  that  she\nstill  had  never  seen  any  state  plan  or  written  plan  as  to  how to\ngo about  complying  with  the  Remedial  Order.  (Tr.  August  9,  1995\nThis  core  problem  is  also  evident  in  the  fact  that  the  Commissioner\nreappointed  the  previously  removed ADC -superintendent  to  a high\nmanagerial  position  with  direct  planning  authority  over ADC.  (Tr.  April\n10,  1995 at  110.)  The former  superintendent  had been  implicated  in  the\ncover-up of  ADC employee misconduct  and removed by the  previous\nCommissioner  from  her  position  at  ADC.  See generally  Tr.  April  10,  1995\nat  110-116 and Tr.  July  10,  1995 at  95-101.  The Commissioner\nacknowledged  in  her  cross-examination  during  the  April  10,  1995 hearing\nthat  she had not  reviewed  the  trial  testimony  of  the  former ADC\nsuperintendent  nor  had  she  read  the  Court's  findings  regarding  this\nindividual.  (Tr.  April  10,  1995 at  115 11.  9-12.)\n15\n\nat 46 11. 15-19.)  While the Commissioner professed good faith in\nrecruiting, she could not even agree with her own University of\nTennessee consultant, Dr. Frederick B. Palmer,\"31 regarding by\nwhom the Developmental Physician would be employed (University of\nTennessee or Arlington Developmental Center).  Cf. Tr. August 9,\n1995 at 35 (Cardwell) with Tr. August 9, 1995 at 79-80 (Palmer).\nThe proof is clear and convincing that the efforts of the\nState of Tennessee to effectuate the stipulated Remedial Order,\nPlan of Correction, Emergency Order and Injunction have been\nsporadic and uncoordinated and have not been directed to\neffectuate the case's central remedial purpose.  (Remedial Order,\nat 1 5 1) (Appendix A).)  The state's resistance to needed change\nis reflected in an April 17, 1995 Memorandum by Dr. Robert\nFisher, a consultant to Commissioner Cardwell hired by the state\nof Tennessee:\nThere appears to be some concern by our academic\npartners, the University of Tennessee (Memphis) and\nVanderbilt University, that the state may not move as\nrapidly as necessary to correct the serious\ndeficiencies that have been noted to exist in our\nDevelopmental Centers.  The University of Tennessee\nMedical School, assisting the Department through our\nArlington Developmental Center, and Vanderbilt\nUniversity through the secondment of a faculty member\nto serve as the Medical Director of the Department, are\ninterested from several perspectives.\nNot only do our academic colleagues believe that the\nsuggested changes from the court are [sic] necessary to\ntl3'  Dr. Frederick B. Palmer is Director of the Bo ling Center for\nDevelopmental Disabilities at the University of Tennessee.\n16\n\nimprove health care for our residents; they also are\nconcerned about maintaining the integrity of their\nreputations (which also, of course, benefits the\nstate), and the increasing legal liability for\nassisting a health care system that may choose, for\nwhatever reason, to not fully accept the advice of\nexternal medical consultants, the courts, and often the\ndepartment's own personnel, (emphasis added).\n(April 17, 1995 Memorandum (Appendix I).)  See also Appendix G &\nJ.  It is clear from the record in this case that Dr. Fisher's\nstatement is accurate.\nOn the entire record in this case, and for the reasons set\nout in this Memorandum Order, the Court finding the defendants in\nCONTEMPT of the Court's orders, ordered the following remedial\nand coercive sanctions effective August 9, 1995:\n1.  Defendants shall pay $1,000 per day for each numbered\nprovision of the Preliminary Injunction with which they are not\nin compliance.  The Court finds that they are in non-compliance\nwith provisions 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8 of the Preliminary Injunction.\nThe fines commence as of the day of the hearing, August 9, 1995,\nand continue for each provision until defendants are in\ncompliance.  Defendants shall pay bi-weekly sums into a Court\nescrow fund.  The Court will later determine whether this fund\nwill either be utilized to enhance implementation of appropriate\n17\n\nremedies  at  ADC, or  be ultimately  forfeited  to  the  United  States.\nProvision  6 is  ordered  to  be  accomplished  by August  24,  1995.lMI\n2.  The Commissioner  for  the  Department  of  Mental  Health  and\nMental  Retardation  shall  spend  every  fourth  weekend1'31 at ADC\nuntil, defendants  are  in  compliance  with  the  Courts'  orders.\nWeekends are  defined  as  the  period  Friday  from  6:00  p.m.  until\nMonday at  7:00  a.m.  The Commissioner  is  to  be  on grounds  the\nentire  weekend  except  if  she  wishes  to  attend  religious  services\noff  grounds,  and  is  to  reside  in  a  resident  living  unit,  not  a\nphysician  or  administrative  area.  The Court  believes  that  the\nCommissioner's  personal  presence  at  ADC on weekends  will  motivate\nADC staff  to  provide  appropriate  care  required  by the  Court's\norders  — especially  during  weekends,  those  times  which  the\nrecord  reflects  are  times  of  particularly  poor  staffing  and  care,\n—  and will  allow  the  Commissioner  and ADC staff  uninterrupted\ntime  to  focus  on bringing  the  institution  into  compliance.\n3.  Defendants  are  to  communicate  with  the  United  States,\nthe  Court  Monitor,  and  the  Monitor's  medical  expert  regarding\ndefendants'  compliance  efforts.  At  any  time  defendants  believe\nll4>  See Tr.  of  telephone  hearing,  August  23,  1995  (proper  procedure  for\nseeking  extension  of  deadline  for  compliance with  injunctive  provision).\n(151  It  should  be noted  that  the  Court  appointed  monitor,  after  the Emergency\nOrder  of  June  30,  1995,  remained  present  at  ADC during  each  day  for  the\nholiday  weekend period  of  Saturday,  July  1,  1995,  until  Wednesday,  July\n5,  1995.  The parties,  the  monitor,  and the  Court,  based  on the  record\nin  this  case,  consistently  have been aware of  the  particular  problems  at\nADC posed  by weekend medical  and direct  care  staffing.  See Tr.  June 30,\n1995 at  39-41  (historical  concern  about  holiday  and weekend coverage).\n18\n\nthey have achieved compliance with any numbered provision, they\nmay communicate this fact to the United States or to the Monitor\nand her expert, and seek their concurrence.  The Court will\nconsider the recommendations of either party or the Court Monitor\nand her expert regarding whether to find defendants in compliance\nwith any provision and to subsequently cease the imposition of\nsanctions for that provision.\nThe Court will schedule another compliance hearing in\napproximately forty-five (45) days to review the status of\ndefendants' compliance with the Court orders.\nIn addition, the Monitor's second compliance report is due\non or before September 20, 1995.  The parties shall submit their\ncomments to the Monitor by no later than 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday,\nOctober 10. 1995.  The Court Monitor will present the final\nreport at a compliance hearing scheduled for October 27, 1995 at\n9:00 a.m.\nENTERED NUNC PRO TUNC this 9th day of August, 1995.\n?.\nPHIPPS McCALLA\n TED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nr\ngned:  August &*\\ , 1995\n19\n\nINDEX OF APPENDICES\nAppendix  A  Remedial Order (September 2, 1994)\nB  Monitor's First Compliance Review (April 10, 1995)\nC  Defendant's Plan of Correction\n(submitted April 10, 1995 as Exh. 6 in the\nApril 10, 1995 hearing)\nD  Preliminary Report - Expert Consultant ADC\nprepared by Dr. Renee C.

The Emergency Order  was\nentered  after the Court Monitor  and the Monitor's  Expert\nDevelopmental Medicine  Physician, Dr. Renee Wachtel,  reported\nthat a state of medical emergency  existed  at ADC, and a  hearing\nby telephone  conference call was-.held with the parties,  the\nMonitor  and Dr. Wachtel.\nA hearing on the Emergency Order was held  on July  10, 1995,\nwherein the Court heard  evidence regarding  compliance with  the\nEmergency  Order and the current state of medical  care at ADC.\nDr. Wachtel  also testified  regarding  her concerns  with\nDefendants' efforts at compliance.  Based upon the  evidence\npresented,  this Court ruled that Defendants had  failed  to  comply\n58\n\nwith  the  Emergency  Order  and  that  the  requirements  of  the\nEmergency Order  were  still  necessary.  Accordingly,  this  Order  is\nhereby  entered  in  the  form  of  a preliminary  injunction,\nincorporating  the  requirements  of  the  Emergency  Order  with\nappropriate  modifications  and  additions.  The Emergency Order was\nmade effective  June  30,  1995,  and  the  deadlines  for  Defendants'\ncompliance  with  those  provisions  are  retained  in  this  Order  and\ntoll  from  the  effective  date  of  the  Emergency Order.  A hearing\nhas  been  set  for  August  9,  1995,  to  determine  further  the  status\nof  Defendants'  compliance  with  this  Order  and  the  continuing  need\nfor  a preliminary  injunction.\n1.  Within  48 hours,  Defendants  shall  retain  a  Developmental\nMedicine  Physician\"1  to  be  full-time  at  Arlington  Developmental\n111  The deadline for  retention of  a full-time  Developmental Medicine Physician\nwas  established  during  the  June  30,  1995  telephone  hearing  and  is\ncontained  in  the  Order  docketed  July  3,  1995.  Also  see  Remedial  Order\n(docketed  September  2,  1994),  Section  VI.A.(Developmental  Medicine\nPhysician  to  be  retained  by  March  2,  1995).  A full-time  Developmental\nMedicine Physician was to be retained  by July  5,  1995.  At the hearing on\nJuly  10,  1995  it  became  clear  that  the  State  had  been  unable  to  comply\nwith paragraph  1 by retaining  a  single  individual  Developmental  Medicine\nPhysician  but  sought to  substantially  comply with paragraph  1.  by using a\nlarge  group  of  Developmental  Physicians.  The medical  conditions  at ADC\nrequire  that  these  services,  to  be  meaningful  and  substantially  in\ncompliance,  be  delivered  by  at  most  a  small  number  of  Developmental\nphysicians  who can provide  complete  hands-on  clinical  care  and who are  in\nclose  communication  with  each  other  in  order  to  provide  consistent,\nreliable,  coordinated  physician  services.  The  objective  and  intent  of\nparagraph  1  is  to  provide  the  medical  leadership,  supervision  and\nexpertise  necessary to  improve the quality of medical services  to  patients\nat  ADC.  Merely  filling  out  a schedule with non-practicing  physicians who\nhappen  to  be  certified  Developmental  Physicians  will  not  constitute\nsubstantial  compliance with paragraph  1.  The defendants  are to make every\neffort  to obtain a qualified  full-time  Developmental Medicine Physician as\nsoon as  possible  and  in  accordance  with  this  Order.\n-  2  -\n\nCenter.

The State of Tennessee concedes\nthat it has not complied with paragraph 2 of the Emergency Order and Preliminary\nInjunction, thus only paragraphs 1 (retention of a full−time developmental physician)\nand 8 (hiring of 136 nurses) are in dispute regarding compliance. For the reasons set\nforth in order, the dfts remain in contempt as to paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Emergency\nOrder and Preliminary Injunction. The fines as to paragraphs 1,2 and 8 should,\ntherefore, remain in effect until the State of Tennessee achieves compliance. The US\nis to submit within 30 days of the entry of this order a comprehensive legal analysis of\nthe remedies available for use in this case, including a proposed remedial sanction\nscheme. The State of Tennessee likewise may, but is not required to, submit its own\nproposed remedial sanctions scheme and authorities supporting it. Likewise, the\nintervenor and class representative, People First, and intervenor, Parent−Guardian\nAssociation may, but are not required to, submit within 30 days such a proposal. Any\nparty may file a response to the initial filings of those parties submitting proposed\nremedial sanctions within 15 days of filing by the US. As an interim step, in lieu of\nthe requirement that Commissioner Cardwell spend every fourth weekend at\nArlington Developmental Center, four (4) key administators, Medical Director Akers,\nSuperintendent Jackson, Director of Nursing Lester, and Remedial Order Facilitator\nHansen, are required to be available one day a month at Arlington Developmental\nCenter for transcribed group and/or individual question and answer sessions.

For the reasons set forth below, the proposed M.S.A. § in this\nclass action is rejected as not being in the best interest of the class.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn December 12, 1991, five Arlington Developmental Center (\"ADC\") residents and People First of Tennessee\nbrought an action against the State of Tennessee and ADC, People First of Tennessee v. Arlington\nDevelopmental Ctr., No. 92-2213 (W.D.Tenn.l992) (\"People First case\"), alleging that the conditions at ADC\nviolated the constitutional and statutory rights of Arlington residents and those at risk of placement there. Plaintiffs\n\nsought injunctive and declaratory relief. The district court permitted the Parent-Guardian Association of Arlington\nDevelopmental Center (PGA) to intervene in the People First case.\nSubsequently, the United States filed an action against the State of Tennessee pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997.\nThe United States asserted that the State had failed to provide humane conditions and adequate treatment to\nADC residents. United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062 (W.D.Tenn.l992)(\"united States case\"). After a trial in\nthe United States case, the court entered judgment against the Defendants finding that the conditions at ADC\nviolated the due process rights of the residents. In August of 1994, the United States and the State of Tennessee\nreached an agreement on the terms of the remedial order to correct the violations. The court entered the\nremedial order on September 2, 1994. On September 26, 1995, the court adopted the findings from the United\nStates case as findings in the People First case and certified a class that included all past, present, and future\n[1]\nresidents.  Furthermore, the court named the Plaintiffs and the Intervenor in the People First case as\nIntervenors in the United States case.\nThe court ordered the State to develop a comprehensive plan for bringing ADC into constitutional and statutory\ncompliance, including a community plan for placing ADC residents into community placement. After a hearing, the\n772 court approved the *772 State's proposed community plan on August 21, 1997. On June 28, 1999, the court\nordered the creation of workgroups to facilitate implementation of the plan and clarified the definition of the \n[2]\nPeople First class.  On January 11, 2000, the court suspended activity of the workgroups for six months. On\nAugust 23, 2000, the court temporarily extended the suspension of the workgroups.\nThe orders clarifying the definition of the \"at risk\" class and suspending the workgroups were appealed to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The parties chose to mediate the appeals. The Sixth Circuit\nMediator initially conducted the mediation. Subsequently, the parties participated in private mediation and\nultimately reached a proposed resolution. The parties participated in numerous mediation sessions from March of\n2001 through October of 2001. On December 10, 2001, the parties entered into a proposed mediation settlement\nagreement, which was filed with this Court.\nThe proposed mediation agreement contains six primary terms and conditions and various components for each\nterm and condition. The primary terms of the M.S.A. § provide that\n1. settlement is conditioned upon the August 24, 2000 Order that suspended the workgroup\nactivity being vacated, as well as, that portion of the August 12, 1997 Order relating to workgroups\n(MSA § XII);\n2. settlement is conditioned upon the July 17, 2000 Order regarding the scope of the \"at risk\" class\nbeing vacated and the issuance of a new Order that redefines the People First \"at risk\" class as\nthose persons who were placed in a private intermediate care facility/mental retardation (\"ICF/\nMR\") after admissions to ADC were closed on September 2, 1994, and before the closure of ADC\n(MSA §§ XII, XIII);\n3. the State is required to develop a closure plan for ADC that must be reviewed by the parties\nand approved by the Court (MSA § II);\n4. the State must improve the quality of community-based services consistent with reasoned\nprofessional judgment (MSA § VI);\n5. the State must increase the array of community residential options to meet the needs of the\nclass members who will transition from ADC to the community (MSA § IV); and\n6. the parties and Court Monitor shall meet for the purpose of monitoring the progress of the State\nwith the ADC Closure Plan and the community initiatives plan (MSA § IX).\nThe parties filed a joint motion requesting that this Court vacate the orders on appeal and that the mediation\nsettlement agreement be entered with this Court. On December 13, 2001, this Court granted the parties' motion.\nThe parties then filed a joint motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit seeking a\nremand. On January 8, 2002, the intermediate appellate court granted the joint motion to remand. United States\n\nv. Tennessee, Nos. 00-6120, 00-6265, and 00-6476 (6th Cir.2002). On February 13, 2002, this Court preliminarily\n773 approved the proposed *773 settlement, designated a notice process, and scheduled a fairness hearing on April\n30, 2002. The Court ordered the parties to provide notice to all class members by February 28, 2002, that all\nparties interested in commenting on or objecting to the settlement should submit comments to the Court by April\n20, 2002. Likewise, the notice advised all those wishing to participate in the fairness hearing to notify the Court by\nApril 20, 2002.\nOn April 30, June 27, and June 28, 2002, this Court held a hearing on the fairness of the proposed settlement\nagreement. At the hearing, the Court heard testimony from the Court Monitor, experts, state officials, and\ninterested parties concerning the fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of the agreement. The Court Monitor,\nstate officials, and some experts testified that the proposed M.S.A. § is in the best interest of the class and that\nthe closure of ADC is a feasible and desirable resolution to the case. The guardians and family members of the\nclass and an expert testified in opposition to the Court's approval of the proposed M.S.A. § because they\nasserted that the community cannot serve all class members upon the closure of ADC. The Court also accepted\nwritten comments from members of the class and/or their parents and guardians, and other parties. The letters\nreceived overwhelmingly expressed opposition to the closure of ADC. Parents and guardians acknowledged the\nbenefits of community placement for some members, but testified that for a large population of members with\nsevere, multiple developmental disabilities, placing them in the community would be tantamount to a death\nsentence.\nPeople First of Tennessee, the State, and the United States recommended that the M.S.A. § be approved. PGA\nopposed the approval of the MSA. PGA's opposition to the M.S.A. § emanated from the provision in the\nagreement requiring the ultimate closure of ADC. PGA's and class member guardians' and family members'\nobjections may be classified into three general categories: 1) closure of ADC, 2) community capacity to serve\npersons who are behaviorally and medically fragile, and 3) community capacity to serve increased transitions\nfrom ADC.\nII. STANDARD TO ASSESS THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nRule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \" [a] class action shall not be dismissed or\ncompromised without the approval of the court....\" Courts maintain a strong presumption in favor of settlement\nagreements because such agreements are a preferred means of dispute resolution. In Re Telectronics Pacing\nSystems, Inc., 137 F.Supp.2d 985,1008 (S.D.Ohio 2001). A court must determine whether the proposed\nsettlement is \"fair, adequate, and reasonable under the circumstances, as well as consistent with public interests\"\nwhen examining the agreement. Id. (quoting Bailey v. Great Lakes Canning, Inc., 908 F.2d 38, 42 (6th Cir.1990)).\nA court must also consider whether the class is better served if the litigation is resolved by the proposed\nsettlement rather than if pursued to a verdict by a jury. Id.\nTo determine whether the proposed settlement is \" fair, adequate, and reasonable,\" a court must evaluate the\nfollowing factors:\n1. the plaintiff's likelihood of ultimate success on the merits balanced against the relief offered by\nthe proposed settlement agreement;\n2. the complexity, expense, and likely duration of litigation;\n3. the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery;\n774 *774 4. the judgment of experienced trial counsel;\n5. the nature of the negotiations;\n6. the objections, concerns and comments of the class members and other interested parties; and\n7. the public interest.\n\nSouthern Ohio Correctional Facility, 173 F.R.D. 205, 212 (S.D.Ohio 1997). \"The district court enjoys wide\ndiscretion in assessing the weight and applicability of these factors.\" Granada Inv., Inc. v. DWG Corp., 962 F.2d\n1203, 1205-06 (6th Cir.1992). A strong presumption exists in favor of deferring to the judgment of a federal\ngovernment agency that has negotiated and submitted a proposed settlement in an effort to enforce federal laws.\nSee Michigan v. Thomas Solvent Co., 717 F.Supp. 507, 515 (W.D.Mich.1989). A court cannot \"modify the\nproposed settlement, but must approve or disapprove the proposed settlement as a whole in relation to all of\nthose concerned.\" In Re Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc., 137 F.Supp.2d at 1008.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Factor One: Plaintiff's Likelihood Of Success On The Merits\nBalanced Against The Relief Offered By The Proposed Settlement\nAgreement\nThe parties agreed to the proposed M.S.A. § during mediation proceedings that were entered into to resolve\nthree appeals related to the district court's Order Regarding Scope of \"At Risk\" Population and Order Granting in\nPart Defendant's Motion Suspending the Workgroup Activities. A determination of Plaintiffs likelihood of success\non the merits, therefore, requires this Court to examine these two orders.\nOn July 17, 2000, the court concluded that \"the 'at risk' portion of the class consists of all individuals who reside\nin the geographic region served by [ADC] and who have demonstrated medical needs sufficient to require\ninstitutional care in the absence of home or community based services.\" See Order Regarding Scope Of \"At\nRisk\" Population, United States v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.1992). The definition advanced by the\nState for the \"at risk\" class was narrowly defined as \"those individuals who have actually been admitted to ADC\nsince the class was certified.\" Id. In rejecting the State's proposed definition, the court opined that \"such an\ninterpretation makes the at risk population a null set because ... no individuals have been admitted to ADC since\nthe class was certified.\" Id. Furthermore, the more expansive definition adopted by the court \"utilizes existing\nMedicaid eligibility guidelines as objective medical criteria for determining which individuals are 'at risk' of being\nplaced at ADC.\" Id.\nThe State appealed the order, and during mediation, the parties adopted another definition of the \"at risk\" class\ncontingent upon the approval of this Court. The definition provides:\n[A]ll persons at risk of being placed at [ADC] shall be construed as including only:\n1. Those persons actually placed at Arlington Developmental Center subsequent to entry of the\nCourt's Order Granting Class Certification on September 27, 1995; and\n2. Those persons:\n(a) placed in private ICF/MR facility in the West Tennessee Region subsequent to closure of\nadmissions to [ADC] on September 2, 1994, and prior to the closure of [ADC]; and\n(b) who apply, within one year of initial notice of eligibility, to receive services under any\n775 Tennessee Home and Community Based Waiver program for people *775 with mental retardation\nand for which they are eligible.\nMSA § XIII (A).\nA comparison of the district court's definition with the parties' proposed definition of the \"at risk\" class reveals that\nthe definition contained in the M.S.A. § is more narrow than the court's definition. Fewer persons, therefore,\nwould be classified as \"at risk\" if the M.S.A. § is approved. This Court concludes that Plaintiff was likely to\nsucceed on the merits on appeal as to the definition of the \"at risk\" class. The court previously ruled that \"the\ninterpretation of the class definition advocated by Defendants is wholly unsupported by the record in this case\n\n....\" See Order Den. Defs.' Mot. To Alter Or Am. J. And Order Den. Mot. For Stay Pending Appeal, United States\nv. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.1992). Accordingly, a balance of Plaintiff's likelihood of success on the\nmerits as to the \"at risk\" class appeal against the relief offered by the proposed M.S.A. § establishes that the\nclass would receive a lesser degree of protection from the MSA's definition of the \"at risk\" class. As such, the\nappeal of the \"at risk\" definition issue, on balance, weighs in favor of denying the proposed MSA.\nPlaintiff and Interveners appealed the court's suspension of the workgroups. When the workgroups were\nsuspended initially in January of 2001, the court reasoned that the temporary suspension of the workgroups was\nnecessary in order to focus on other areas of work that had to be brought to a timely conclusion. The court\nconcluded that resources, such as time and money, would be better served by temporarily suspending the use of\nthe workgroups. The court, however, did not intend to suspend the workgroups forever. This is evidenced by the\ncourt's statement that\nthe workgroups [are regarded by the court] as exactly what the parties said they were in their\nconsent order as important in the case, and [the court has not] changed [its] view on that. [The\ncourt] said [the parties] had to prioritize matters .... [The court's] thought on [suspension] is that\n[the workgroups] are certainly not going to [be] suspended[ ] forever ....\nSee Tr. of Status Conference on August 17, 2000, United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062 (W.D.Tenn.1992).\nThis Court, therefore, concludes that the Plaintiffs' appeal of the suspension of the workgroups order had little\nlikelihood of success on the merits as the court's actions were inherently discretionary. Furthermore, the\nproposed M.S.A. § would potentially eliminate the necessity of workgroups.\nRuby Kay Moore, an expert who reviewed ADC and the community programs, opined at the fairness hearing that\nthe M.S.A. § has \"numbers and schedules and time line sources and conditions that make [it] more likely that it\nwill actually be achieved.\" Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 383-84, Test, of Ruby Kay Moore, United States v. Tennessee,\n798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn. 1992). She further stated that the M.S.A. § is a plan \"in which everybody has agreed\nto how [it] will go,\" and that it is \"a collective responsibility to keep it on track and to participate in saying how [the\nparties] shall [ ] best proceed so that [the parties'] concerns are all met.\" Id. In sum, the implementation of the\nterms of the M.S.A. § would be dependent upon the parties' determination, at a future date, of what the best\napproach is to reach the objectives of the MSA.\nThe workgroups were intended to facilitate implementation of the community plan. The proposed M.S.A. §\nappears to contemplate the utilization of controls and mechanisms for the implementation of the terms of the\n776 agreement. The proposed M.S.A. § would result in the ultimate and *776 imminent closure of ADC. The closure\nwould require, therefore, a complete transition to community care providers. The closure plan drafted pursuant to\nthe M.S.A. § could include the utilization of workgroups, but does not appear to require workgroups. Balancing\nPlaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits as to the workgroups issue with the relief offered by the proposed\nM.S.A. § establishes that both could result in the use of workgroups. Accordingly, neither factor outweighs the\nother, and the balance is neutral in effect.\nAlthough the balancing of the workgroups appeal is neutral, the balance of the \"at risk\" definition appeal favors a\ndenial of the MSA. If the Court approved the proposed MSA, the \"at risk\" class definition would reduce the\nnumber of people who are eligible to receive services from approximately 1,200 to approximately 100 persons.\nThis substantial reduction would result in the denial of services to numerous persons that the district court\ndetermined were included in the class. Moreover, the Court finds that such a drastic reduction would expose\nlarge numbers of class members to potential harm. Accordingly, the Court concludes that balancing Plaintiffs\nlikelihood of success on the merits as to the three appeals against the relief offered by the settlement agreement\nweighs in favor of denying the proposed MSA.\n\nB. Factors Two And Three: The Complexity, Expense, And Likely\nDuration Of Litigation; and The Stage Of The Proceedings And The\nAmount Of Discovery\nThe Court will examine these factors together given their interrelation. These consolidated actions were filed\nmore than a decade ago. After a trial in the United States case, the district court entered judgment against the\nDefendants finding that the conditions at ADC violated the due process rights of the residents. In August of 1994,\nthe United States and the State of Tennessee reached an agreement on the terms of the remedial order to\ncorrect due process violations. Since that time, a long history of litigation, remediation, contempt motions and\nfindings, monitoring enforcement actions, and negotiation has occurred.\nNo question exists as to the complexity of the case and the substantial expense that has been generated in an\nattempt to comply with the remedial order. The complexity of this litigation, and the stage of the proceeding\ninvolved therein, are exemplified by the three separate appeals that were pending in the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit and by the extensive litigation history in an eleven year-old case. Moreover, the\nlitigation expenses incurred in the case include numerous attorney and expert fees. Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes that these factors weigh in favor of the approval of the proposed MSA.\nC. Factors Four and Five: The Judgment Of Experienced Trial\nCounsel; and The Nature Of The Negotiations\nIt is undisputed that several experienced trial attorneys and senior representatives of the parties have\nparticipated extensively and, therefore, are aware intimately of the complexity and seriousness of the case. Most\nof the trial counsel involved in this litigation have several years of legal experience in litigation. With the exception\nof PGA and its counsel, all of the attorneys and parties agree that the proposed M.S.A. § should be approved.\nThe testimony elicited at the fairness hearing indicates that the negotiations were arms-length. The Court\nMonitor, Dr. Nancy K. Ray, participated in some of the mediation sessions and had input on the document. See\n777 Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at *777 69 and 85, Test, of Dr. Ray, United States v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.\n1992). The Court Monitor recommended approval of the MSA. Id. at 69 and 89-90.\nIn addition to the Court Monitor, all of the parties, including PGA, participated in extensive negotiations and were\nrepresented by counsel at all stages of the negotiations. See Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 588-624, Test, of Carolyn\nCowans, United States v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.1992). PGA had three or four representatives\nat the mediation sessions at all times. PGA also had two board meetings separated by a period of a week during\nwhich they consulted with counsel prior to authorizing its then-President, Mr. Richard Johnson, to sign the MSA.\n[3]\n Id. The mediation session took place over a number of months and included a number of meetings between\nthe parties. See id. at 589-90 and 614-24.\nThe negotiations were conducted initially under the supervision of the Sixth Circuit mediator and the Sixth Circuit\nrules concerning mediation and subsequently under the auspices of a private mediator. All parties participated in\nall the negotiations, and all parties were represented by counsel who were experienced in this matter from its\nbeginning. The Court Monitor also participated in the negotiations. The Court holds, therefore, that the nature of\nthe negotiations were fair, the parties were under no undue influence, and there was no collusion between the\nparties. Accordingly, these factors weigh in favor of the approval of the proposed MSA.\n\nD. Factor Six: The Objections, Comments, And Concerns Of Class\nMembers And Other Interested Parties\nThis Court received written comments and testimony from class members, relatives and guardians of class\nmembers, and other interested parties. At the fairness hearing, the Court heard oral testimony from\napproximately sixteen relatives or guardians of class members. Furthermore, the Court received approximately\n100 letters in opposition to the proposed MSA. The overriding concern expressed in these letters and testimony\nrelate to the proposed MSA's closure of ADC and the vulnerability and medical fragility of class members.\nIncluded in an evaluation of this factor, therefore, are specific concerns expressed in these letters and testimony.\nDr. R.F.A., the single parent of an ADC resident, expressed his concern via letter about the proposed closure of\nADC. His daughter who is currently thirty-five-years old has resided at ADC since the early 1970s. Dr. A. stated\nthat \"[he] knows how difficult it is to provide for such special needy individuals who are so totally dependent for\ntheir daily needs, both nutritional and hygienic.\" He opined that \" [t]o close [ADC] would be a real-time travesty for\nthis community and for these residents in particular. Closing Arlington would be tantamount to throwing out not\n778 just the *778 baby with the bathwater, but indeed to throwing out all baby's [sic] with the bathwater.\" While he is\nnot an expert on these issues, the Court will not disregard his background knowledge.\nC. A., the sister and co-guardian of an ADC resident, also wrote a letter to the Court. Her sister, who is severely\nretarded and confined to a wheelchair, has been a resident at ADC since 1971 or 1972. Ms. A.'s sister was\nplaced in a nursing home for a short period of time. Ms. A. stated that\n[t]he nursing home did not know how to deal with a severely retarded person. They just wanted to\nkeep her sedated all of the time. [S]he stayed agitated and depressed all of the time[,] and she\nbecame aggressive. She tore her clothes, picked at herself until she had sores all over her arms\nand she even tore the curtains down off the walls in her room at the nursing home.\nIn sum, Ms. A. expressed her concern that her sister would not survive very long if forced to leave ADC.\nRick and Suzanne B. are the parents of an ADC resident. Their daughter has lived at ADC for approximately\ntwenty years. Their daughter is fed with a feeding tube and breathes through a tracheal tube. She is unable to\nspeak and is profoundly retarded. Furthermore, she suffers from epilepsy and Wilson's Disease. She requires\nmultiple medications, which must be monitored by laboratory analysis. Accordingly, the B.'s daughter must be\nattended by a respiratory therapist four times a day and receive around the clock care by nurses and doctors. Mr.\nand Mrs. B. believe that an ICF/MR facility better serves the medically fragile in the community such as their\nchild.\nJune D.C. wrote the Court to object to the closing of ADC. Ms. C. is the sister of an ADC resident. Her brother,\nwho has resided at ADC for thirty-two years, is severely retarded. He has severe receptive and expressive\nlanguage delay. Ms. C.'s brother also engages in self-injurious behavior. Because of his history of low body\nweight, he must be closely monitored at mealtime and requires the services of a licensed dietician. Ms. C. and\nher family fear that her brother's health and life will be at risk if placed in the community.\nCarolyn C., the mother of an ADC resident, relayed her concerns about the closure of ADC. Some of the medical\nconditions from which her son suffers include cerebral palsy, severe spastic quadriplegia, seizure disorder,\ngastroesophageal reflux disease, dysphagia, and scoliosis. He is profoundly retarded and is unable to perform\nany daily living skills. He requires twenty-four hour care. Furthermore, Ms. C.'s son faces significant physical and\nnutritional care challenges. He uses a customized seating system adapted to a wheelchair base for mobility. He\nalso requires custom equipment for alternate positioning purposes. During mealtime he uses adaptive feeding\nequipment, including a special headrest insert. He is at great risk of aspiration, and in fact has choked before. In\nsuch instances, he must receive immediate attention. Ms. C. opined that \"the centralized service delivery\nsystem... [which ADC] offers [is] the best model of care for [her son].\" Moreover, people with mental retardation\nand developmental disabilities are unique, and the configuration of the care systems must be equally unique. She\nbelieves that a serious lack of medical supports in the community system exists. Ms. C. believes, therefore, that\n\nthe elimination of ADC in the absence of an equitable placement would place the medically and behaviorally\nfragile at risk of great harm and possibly death. She also testified that she is concerned that many people in the\n779 community receive their medical treatment at ADC because adequate medical care is unavailable in the *779\ncommunity. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 582, Test, of Carolyn C., UUnited States v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483\n(W.D.Tenn. 1992). Ms. C. testified that with the closure of ADC, there will not be a sufficient \"safety net\" for\npeople transitioned into the community who are in crisis situations and need to return. Id. at 586.\nBarbara Cn. and Walter Cr., family members of ADC residents, also wrote the Court opposing the closure of\nADC. Both residents are severely retarded, non-ambulatory, and mute. One is fed by a feeding tube, and both\nrequire around the clock care. Ms. Cn. and Mr. Cr. question the State's ability to provide adequate care to\npersons with such severe conditions in a community setting.\nJoe H. expressed concern that his sister, an ADC resident, would have a difficult time adjusting to a move and\nthat such a move would shorten her life. Mr. H. also is concerned that housing in safe communities is not readily\navailable because potential neighbors attempt to block ADC residents from moving into their communities.\nAt the fairness hearing, Nadine Mc. objected to the closure of ADC. Her son has resided at ADC for fourteen\nyears. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 477, Test, of Nadine Mc., United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062\n(W.D.Tenn.1992). He is non-ambulatory, blind, and fed via a feeding tube. Id. He suffers from aspiration\npneumonia approximately three or four times per year, and he requires oxygen for the least illness. Id. Ms. Mc.'s\nson has been resuscitated twice. Id. She opined that had her son not received immediate medical aid, he would\nhave died. Id. at 477-78. She questions whether a community setting could adequately address such pervasive\nemergency needs. Even if such services exist, Ms. Mc. believes that her son's health is so fragile that he would\nnot survive in the community. Id. at 478.\nBarbara D., the parent of an ADC resident, also testified at the fairness hearing. Ms. D.'s daughter has resided at\nADC since 1974. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 474, Test, of Barbara D., United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062\n(W.D.Tenn.1992). Her daughter is terminally ill. Id. Ms. D. testified that her daughter could not survive in the\ncommunity even though other class members may be capable of doing so. Id. Ms. D. concluded her testimony by\nstating that she is so worried about the proposed closing of ADC that she \"actually prays to god that [her\ndaughter] will die before this settlement is [approved.]\" Id. at 475.\nNora S. is the mother of a class member who has been transitioned into the community. Ms. S. testified that her\nson goes to ADC almost everyday. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 668, Test, of Nora S., Unites States v. Tennessee, 798\nF.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.1992). She further stated that all of his medical and dental care is provided by ADC. Id.\nMs. S. expressed her hope that ADC would remain open to care for those that are medically fragile and to\nprovide medical services to those in the community. Id.\nAt the fairness hearing, Dr. Ray testified that the M.S.A. § proposed closure of ADC with the placement of class\nmembers into the community is a viable plan of which she approves. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 70-72, Test, of Dr.\nNancy Ray, United States v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.1992). She pointed to other examples\nwhere community placement has been successful, and noted that the trend is toward community placement for\nenhanced care. She also testified that some medically fragile ADC residents have already been transitioned into\nthe community setting. Id. at 82-83. Dr. Ray stated that instances had arisen in which \"some individuals medical\n780 needs [became] so complex *780 and they [became] so medically fragile that they [were] not [ ] able to be\nmaintained in a small community living home...\" Id. at 82. In some of these instances, Dr. Ray testified that the\nresidents were placed in rehabilitation facilities, one of which is a licensed long-term hospital. Id. Dr. Ray stated\nthat the health conditions of two elderly residents placed into the community deteriorated in a predictable way. Id.\nThe community providers, family members, and Community Services Network (\"CSN\") determined that these\nresidents \"would be better cared for in [ ] an actual medical facility.\" Id. at 83. Dr. Ray also expressed concern\nthat a community living arrangement would not be available by the proposed closure date to accommodate\nindividuals who are ventilator dependent. Id. at 91-92.\nCarlene Leaper, the Executive Director for Mid-South ARC and a member of the Abuse and Neglect Prevention\nCommittee (\"ANPC\"), testified that the number of incidents of abuse and neglect in the community has not\nreduced during her six year tenure on ANPC. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 423, Test, of Carlene Leaper, United States v.\n\nTennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.1992). Ms. Leaper also indicated that some suspected instances of\nreported abuse and neglect in the community were not investigated by the State. Id. at 426. Likewise, Victor T.,\nSr., the parent of a severely retarded ADC resident and an ANPC member, expressed his concern at the fairness\nhearing about the ability of the community to effectively address the needs of the medically fragile ADC residents.\nId. at 457. Mr. T. correctly noted that the medical needs of the population are not static, and will at some time\nrequire varying response levels.\nSandra D. testified about her sister's transition into the community. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 469, Test, of Sandra D.,\nUnited States v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483 (W.D.Tenn.1992). Ms. D. asserted that she had difficulty finding\ndoctors in the community willing to treat her sister. Id. Ms. D. eventually secured medical providers for her sister\nwith the help of CSN. Id. She stated that she was worried, however, about the ability of other residents to secure\nproper medical care in the community. Id. Ms. D. testified in effect that she objects to the closure of ADC because\nthe medically and mentally fragile, even if placed into the community, need a facility to provide necessary\nservices. Id. at 469-72. Ms. D. also expressed concern about the number of deaths of class member that\noccurred in the community. Id. at 472. If ADC is closed and the population is transitioned into the community, she\nbelieves this number will rise dramatically.\nRick Campbell, the Deputy Director for the Tennessee Commission on Compliance, testified concerning the\npossible steps that would be utilized when closing ADC to minimize disruption to the class. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at\n146-81, United States v. Tennessee, Test, of Rick Campbell, No. 92-2062 (W.D.Tenn.1992). Mr. Campbell stated\nthat the State envisioned providing actual residential services to certain medically complex class members. Id. at\n158. Further, the State would support unique homes that would be operated for persons who have the greatest\nmedical issues. Id. Mr. Campbell also testified that the State would propose in the closure plan to operate State-\nrun homes for medically complex residents and small medical units for transitions from hospitals back to the\ncommunity. Id. at 159. Mr. Campbell admitted that in the community there are no physicians on site and most of\nthe homes do not have nurses on duty around the clock. Id. at 200-01. Given the medical fragility of a large\n781 portion of the class, this must be *781 factored into the calculus of approval of the MSA.\nDr. James Conroy, an expert in the evaluation and research in the areas of care and service of delivery systems\nfor persons with developmental disabilities, testified that people are better off in a community setting than in an\ninstitutional setting. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 274-75, Test, of Dr. James Conroy, United States v. Tennessee, No.\n92-2062 (W.D.Tenn. 1992). Dr. Conroy admitted, however, that a community setting is not appropriate for\neveryone, and that questions remain about whether the mortality rate of people in the community is greater than\nin institutions. Id. at 289. Dr. Karen Anderson, the Medical Director for CSN, also opined that medically fragile\nresidents will receive appropriate care and support services if the proposed M.S.A. § is approved. Id. at 316.\nDr. Theodore Kastner, President of the Developmental Disabilities Health Alliance, testified for PGA concerning\ncommunity care versus institutional care. Dr. Kastner stated that he does not believe that adequate evidence\nexists to show that community care is consistently better than institutional care. Tr. of Fairness Hr'g at 508, Test,\nof Dr. Theodore Kastner, United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062 (W.D.Tenn.1992). Dr. Kastner further opined\nthat there are no states that are completely institution free. Id. at 512. All states have \"the ability to place\nsomeone in an institution when they need to because they contract with private operators to provide [the] service\nor they have community [intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded]... .\" Id. at 513. Therefore, states\nmay close their public facilities but continue to operate institutions via private providers. Id.\nDr. Kastner noted that as people have moved from institutions to the community, many continue to have needs\nthat require more intensive health care services than can be offered in group homes. Id. at 514. As a result, many\npersons are placed in nursing homes which are often ill equipped to meet the needs of persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities. Id. Dr. Kastner opined that many developmentally disabled people do not have access\nto the home and community-based waiver because it is an optional service. Id. Persons with developmental\ndisabilities, however, have access to nursing homes because it is an entitlement through the Medicaid program. \nId. Dr. Kastner stated that nursing homes are not the most appropriate setting for people with developmental\ndisabilities. Id. Moreover, Dr. Kastner asserted that studies indicate that there is a significant increase in the\nrelative risk of mortality in community settings versus in institutions. Id. at 519. Studies also indicate that a\n\nsubstantial increase in actual deaths exists as opposed to expected deaths among those placed in the\ncommunity. Id.\nThese are but a few samples of the comments and very grave concerns expressed by representatives and\nrelatives of ADC class members and other interested parties. The Court believes that such comments help to\ncontextualize the enormity of the issues represented in this lawsuit. The Court finds that these issues are not an\nabstraction nor can they be reduced to an academic discussion. Rather, in many cases for the families and class\nmembers, they believe that the issues are of life and death magnitude. At the very least, all parties agree that the\ndecision will unalterably affect the ultimate quality of life for the class members.\nThe concerns and objections expressed by the families and guardians of the class members relate almost\nentirely to the closure provision of the MSA. As evidenced by the preceding statements, the overriding concern of\n782 these individuals relates *782 to the ability of the community to serve those class members that are medically and\nbehaviorally fragile.\nThe Court recognizes that even when a majority of class members oppose a proposed settlement agreement, the\nCourt may still approve the agreement if the Court finds that the settlement agreement is in the best interest of\nthe class. See Heit v. Van Ochten, 126 F.Supp.2d 487, 491 (W.D.Mich.2001). In fact, the Court is mandated to\nevaluate the agreement based on a \"best interest of the class\" standard. In the instant case, approximately 100\nof approximately 450 class members objected to the approval of the proposed MSA. Cf. Rolland v. Cellucci, 191\nF.R.D. 3, 9-11 (D.Mass.2000)(holding that \"no real opposition was expressed to the Settlement Agreement [by\nclass members].\"). The concerns expressed by the class and other interested parties relate to issues of life and\ndeath and the quality of life of class members. Accordingly, the Court gives great deference to the opinions of the\npersons most capable of determining what is in the best interest of the class members, i.e., the guardians and\nfamily of the class members. See Rolland, 191 F.R.D. at 12 (finding that the \"Settlement Agreement ... ensures\nthat no class member will be involuntarily transferred from a nursing home to the community.\").\nAs noted previously, numerous people testified for the United States, the State of Tennessee, and People First of\nTennessee as to the viability and desirability of closing ADC. This Court agrees that the transition of all class\nmembers into community homes is an ideal solution to the problems that exist with ADC, assuming that the\ncommunity could adequately meet each member's needs. This Court, however, is highly skeptical that the\ncomplete closure of ADC, accompanied with a responsible and safe transition to the community of those class\nmembers who are the most medically and behaviorally fragile, is possible at this time. Testimony by interested\nparties indicates that finding physicians willing and capable of treating class members in the community has\nproven difficult. The Court has not been shown sufficient evidence that this condition is going to ameliorate in the\nfuture. The Court recognizes that CSN is making substantial headway in insuring that class members in the\ncommunity have appropriate medical care available. The testimony and letters received by the Court indicate,\nhowever, that many class members that have been transitioned into the community continue to rely on medical\nservices provided by ADC. This testimony is supported by Dr. Kastner's testimony that as people have moved\nfrom institutions to the community, many continue to have needs that require more intensive health care services\nthan can be offered in group homes.\nThe Court also finds troubling, testimony that persons unable to receive adequate medical care in the community\nmay be placed in nursing homes. Nursing homes are not designed or equipped to handle the needs of class\nmembers who are medically and behaviorally fragile. Moreover, the proposed M.S.A. § will narrow the \"at risk\"\nclass. This reduction of persons in the \"at risk\" class could translate into an even larger placement of the\ndevelopmentally disabled into nursing homes.\nLikewise, the Court finds compelling the testimony concerning mortality rates in the community versus in\ninstitutions. Dr. Kastner opined that studies indicate that a substantial increase in actual deaths exists as opposed\nto expected deaths among those placed in the community. Moreover, Dr. Kastner asserted that studies indicate\nthat there is a significant increase in the relative risk of mortality in the community versus in institutions. Dr.\n783 Conroy, who testified in support of community placement *783 of all persons with developmental disabilities,\nadmitted that questions remain about whether the mortality rate of people in the community is greater than in\ninstitutions. Retired Chief Justice Fones of the Tennessee Supreme Court expressed his concern about the\npossible closure of ADC when he stated that\n\n[t]he 242 residents there are the most severely impaired in the mental health system, and\nremoving them from the care they are receiving at Arlington is the equivalent of issuing 242 death\ncertificates. Those human beings cannot survive in any environment providing less professional\ncare than they receive at Arlington.\nWhile this Court is uncertain that the closure of ADC would result in such a tragic situation, the Court cannot take\nlightly expert testimony that indicates that an increase in mortality rates exists in the community. Nor can the\nCourt cavalierly ignore the observations and the real life stories of the guardians and family members who live\nwith these issues daily. Theirs is not a clinical or hypothetical assessment, but rather a living testament.\nAccordingly, for the above reasons, this Court concludes that the concerns of the class members and other\ninterested parties weighs heavily against the Court's approval of the proposed MSA.\nE. Factor Seven: The Public Interest\nThe public interest in this case is insuring that class members who are developmentally disabled receive\nappropriate care in accordance with their Constitutional rights. Whether the proposed M.S.A. § is in the public\ninterest necessarily revolves around the proposed closure of ADC. This Court must determine, therefore, whether\nthe closure of ADC will permit those that are the most medically and behaviorally fragile to receive sufficient care.\n\"[W]hen a person is institutionalized and wholly dependent on the state ... a duty to provide certain services and\ncare [ ] exists....\" Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 317, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). Pursuant to the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the State has:\na duty to provide adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care. These are the essentials of\nthe care the state must provide. The State also has the unquestioned duty to provide reasonable\nsafety for all residents and personnel within the institution... [Residents maintain] constitutionally\nprotected interests in the conditions of reasonable care and safety, reasonable non-restrictive\nconfinement conditions, and such training as may be required by these interests.\nId. at 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (emphasis added); see also Collins v. City of Harker Heights, Texas, 503 U.S. 115,\n127, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992) (\"Due Process Clause of its own force requires that conditions of\nconfinement satisfy certain minimum standards... for persons in mental institutions\").\nYoungberg clearly establishes that the Fourteenth Amendment insures that these class members must receive\nadequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care from the State. Moreover, the Constitution requires the State to\nprovide reasonable care and safety for all residents. Issues such as the potential lack of appropriate healthcare\nproviders in the community for class members, the potential lack of suitable housing in safe neighborhoods for\nclass members, and the potential increase in mortality rates of class members in the community must be given\nsubstantial consideration.\nAs evidenced by the Remedial Order and the Emergency Orders entered on July 3, 1995 and July 21, 1995, the\n784 Court *784 has endeavored to insure that class members receive adequate medical care by increasing to\nappropriate ratios the number of physicians and other medical care providers at ADC. See Remedial Order, \nUnited States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062 (W.D.Tenn.1992); Emergency Order, United States v. Tennessee, No.\n92-2062 (W-D.Tenn.1992); Order, United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062 (W.D.Tenn.1992). Furthermore, the\nCourt has closely monitored the deaths of residents at ADC in an attempt to protect other residents from\nunnecessary harm or death. Id. This Court is unwilling to risk the progress thus far achieved for the benefit of the\nclass members by approving a plan that will potentially diminish the Constitutional protection of those class\nmembers who are the most in need of increased protection00the medically and behaviorally fragile.\n97\nIn Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 601-02, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999), the United States Supreme\nCourt held that \"nothing in the [Americans with Disabilities Act] or its implementing regulations condones\ntermination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.... Nor is there\nany federal requirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.\" The Court\nalso recognized \"the States' need to maintain a range of facilities for the care and treatment of persons with\n\ndiverse mental disabilities, and the States' obligation to administer services with an even hand.\" Id. at 597, 119\nS.Ct. 2176. The plurality in Olmstead opined that \"[f]or many mentally retarded people, the difference between\nthe capacity to do things for themselves within an institution and total dependence on the institution for all their\nneeds is as much liberty as they will ever know.\" 527 U.S. at 605, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 327, 102 S.Ct. 2452.). While not requiring states to provide institutional care, Olmstead makes it clear that the\nSupreme Court recognizes that community placement of the developmentally disabled is not always feasible or\nwise!\nThis Court is not satisfied that the State has demonstrated the ability to provide the constitutionally mandated\nreasonable care and safety in the community to those class members that are the most medically and\nbehaviorally fragile. Accordingly, this Court is unconvinced that the public interest in protecting the Constitutional\nrights of the class members is served by allowing the proposed closure of ADC without having in place a range of\nfacilities and services for the care and treatment of persons with diverse mental disabilities. The Court concludes\nthat the public interest is better served if ADC remains open in sufficient form for the medically and behaviorally\nfragile of the class given the questions surrounding the care received in the community setting and the stakes\ninvolved with such placement. The constitutional rights of the class members, therefore, weigh heavily in favor of\ndenying the proposed MSA.\nCONCLUSION\nThe factors that weigh against the approval of the proposed M.S.A. § include 1) Plaintiffs likelihood of success on\nthe merits balanced against the relief offered by the proposed settlement, 2) the objections and concerns of the\nclass members and other interested parties, and, most importantly, 3) the public interest in protecting the\nConstitutional rights of the class members. Given the gravity of the factors that weigh in favor of the denial of this\nCourt's approval of the proposed MSA, the Court finds that the proposed settlement agreement is not fair,\nadequate, and reasonable. Accordingly, the Court DENIES without prejudice the Joint Motion of the parties for\n785 approval of the *785 proposed Mediation Settlement Agreement. The parties are encouraged to develop and\npresent a comprehensive and varied plan that adequately provides for the care and treatment of the medically\nand behaviorally fragile class.\n[1] The People First certified class includes persons who: (1) resided at ADC on or after December 12, 1989; (2)\nare currently residing at ADC; (3) have been transferred from ADC to other settings but remain \"Defendants'\nresponsibility;\" and (4) are at risk of being placed at ADC. See Order Granting Mot. To Certify Case As A Class\nAction entered September 26, 1995, People First of Tennessee v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., No. 91-2213\n(W.D.Tenn.1991). A dispute arose at a hearing on March 2, 2000, concerning the meaning of persons who \"are at\nrisk of being placed at ADC.\"\n[2] This Court clarified the \"at risk of being placed at Arlington Developmental Center\" portion of the People First\nclass as \"all individuals who reside in the geographic region served by Arlington Developmental Center . .. and\nwho have demonstrated medical needs sufficient to require care in the absence of home or community based\nservices.\" See Mem. Op. And Order entered June 28, 1999, United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062\n(W.D.Tenn.1992).\n[3] As mentioned previously, PGA initially approved the MSA. At the fairness hearing, however, PGA opposed the\nadoption of the MSA. PGA alleged that its Board of Directors were required to maintain the confidentiality of the\nmediation proceedings in order to participate. PGA asserted in effect, therefore, that it approved the M.S.A. §\nunder duress because it was unable to disclose the terms of the M.S.A. § to the members of the PGA. When\nPGA signed the MSA, however, it stipulated that it retained objections and reservations as to certain terms of the\nagreement. None of these objections and reservations included the proposed closure of ADC. This Court\nconcludes that PGA's president had the authority to agree to the M.S.A. § and that PGA's adoption of the M.S.A.\n§ is binding. In order to assess the fairness of the MSA, the Court permitted PGA to proffer class and expert\ntestimony concerning the MSA. This Court will consider, therefore, this testimony to thoroughly assess the\nfairness of the proposed MSA.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
