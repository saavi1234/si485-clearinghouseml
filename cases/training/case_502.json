Winston Developmental Center in Bolivar, Tennessee. The investigation also included the Harold Jordon Habilitation Center, a program at Clover Bottom. The investigation revealed numerous violations of the constitutional and statutory rights of the developmentally delayed residents of the facilities. The Department of Justice suspected that the abuse of residents by staff at Clover Bottom constituted criminal behavior.</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 1996, the United States filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against the State of Tennessee on behalf of individuals residing at the three facilities. The complaint alleged numerous violations of the constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Tennessee state law. These included failure to provide education and adequate medical care, abusive treatment, and insufficient staffing. The lawsuit followed a similar private lawsuit filed against the state, <a href=\"../../../../case/500/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">People First of Tennessee v. Clover Bottom Developmental Center</a>, Civ. No. 96-cv-01056 (M.D.Tenn.),&nbsp;and essentially simultaneously with the complaint, the U.S. moved to consolidate the cases; this motion was granted two weeks later.</p>\r\n<p>All three parties immediately settled, and the settlement was approved by Judge Echols in November of 1996. The state agreed to a number of changes, including the following:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Create person-centered evaluation of citizens in need of services</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Develop community programs and resources</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Increase staffing and staff training</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Improve living conditions in the centers</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Provide education for school-age residents</p>\r\n<p>For a record of compliance litigation information, please see <a href=\"../../../../case/500/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">People First of Tenn. v. Clover Bottom Devel. Center</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The court monitored the settlement until September 8, 2017, when Chief Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw issued an order in a related case that stated the parties agreed that defendants had \"completed and fulfilled\" their obligations under the settlement.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

During the week of September 19, 1994, we toured\nthe facility accompanied by consultants in the fields of\nmedicine, psychology, nursing and physical therapy.  We wish to\nexpress our appreciation for the cooperation shown by the GVDC\nstaff and the representatives from the Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation and the Attorney General's office\nduring this investigation.  On September 24, 19 94, we conveyed to\nthe. facility superintendent and other state officials an initial\nassessment of deficiencies at the facility.  Our full assessment\nof conditions at GVDC has now been completed.\nWe regret to advise you that we found numerous conditions at\nGVDC that violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights\nof the residents there.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment and\nrelevant federal statutes, residents of state-operated  facilities\nfor the developmentally disabled and mentally retarded have a\nright to, inter alia, adequate medical care, reasonably safe\nconditions, and training sufficient to protect each resident's\nliberty interests, including training to permit each resident an\nopportunity to function as independently as possible.  Programs\nmust be provided to teach adaptive skills, including self-help,\ncommunication, and social skills.  In addition, individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities must be provided services in\ncommunity-based programs where appropriate. 1/\n1/  See, e-c•, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, e_t sea, (and implementing\nregulations, 23 C.F.R. 35 . 130(b) (1) , and 23 C.F.R. 35.130(d));\n(continued...)\n\n- 2 -\nIn addition, GVDC is net. in compliance with the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, e_t sec. .\nSection 5C4 cf the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794,\net sea., the substantive provisions of Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Ace, 4 2 U.S.C. § 13 95, e_t_ sea. . and the Individuals v:ith\nDisabilities Education .Act  (IDEA),  20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 - 1485.\nThe facts disclosed during; the course cf our investigation\nthat support cur findings of unconstitutional conditions and\nviolations of federal statutory rights at GVDC are set forth\nbelow.\nI.  Medical Care is Dangerously Deficient.\nA.  General Medical Care\nDue to an inadequate medical care delivery system,\nespecially the failure to provide adequate preventive and chronic\ncare, GVDC residents are subjected to needless fractures,\nrecurrent aspiration, preventable weight loss, recurring\nseizures, avoidable injuries, and other direct threats to their\nhealth.  Records of residents reviewed by our medical consultant\nindicate, for example, repeated fractures over many years absent\npreventive measures; recurrent aspirations, dysphagia and\npneumonias without a coherent management plan to treat and\notherwise address these life-threatening ailments; significant,\nrapid weight loss representing a direct threat to health which\nwas often not acknowledged or acted upon by professional staff;\nmultiple drug use absent adequate justification; and other\nmisdiagnosed or untreated injuries.  Significantly, the lack of\nindividual or facility-wide data with respect to these urgent\nmedical needs of residents not only compromises the care of\nindividual residents, but limits the ability of the medical staff\nand administration to properly allocate resources, develop plans,\n!./(.. .continued)\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1S73, 29 U.S.C. § 794,\net sea.; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395,\net sea, (and implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. § 483.420 -\n4 8 0) ; Younaberc\" v.

In sum, medical care\nfor the mcsc serious needs of the facility's residents is\ninadequate and fails to comporc with generally accepted medical\nstandards.\nIn addition, medication practices are deficient.  There are\nnumerous residents who have been prescribed multiple\nanticonvulsant and/or'psychotropic medications for years.  In\nview of the potential risks associated with many of these\nmedications, including potential for toxicity, tardive\ndyskir.esia, and reduced cognition, it is generally accepted by\nmedical professionals that polypharmacy or the prescription of\nmultiple medications should be avoided where possible.  However,\nGVDC physicians continue to prescribe such medications absent any\nrational justification in violation of medical standards.\nIndeed, psychotropic medications are used on a routine basis at\nthe facility absenc adequate rationale or a psychiatric or\nneuropsychiatric diagnosis.  The ubiquitous use of anticonvulsant\nand psychotropic medication also indicates inadequate\nconsultation with neurologists and psychiatrists.  These\npractices are unacceptable.\nThe absence of adequate participation of psychiatrists in\nthe treatment of residents is particularly significant.  For\nthose dually diagnosed individuals who need both behavioral\nprogramming and medication for their mental illness, it is\ncritical that both treatment modalities be integrated properly.\nThe unavailability of adequate psychiatric consultation has\nseverely impeded the ability of GVDC to address the needs of\nthose residents.  The inappropriate use of psychotropic\nmedication is a direct result of this deficiency.\nQuality control, peer review, and coordination mechanises\nfor medical.care are virtually non-existent.  The relationships\nbetween physicians and other personnel such as occupational\ntherapists, physical therapists, psychologists, and nurses is\nill-defined.  Although GVDC's policies require that physicians <\norder certain therapies, there is no mechanism to ensure that\nthose needing the various therapies receive such orders.  Kedical\nstaff meetings apparently take place only sporadically.  There is\nno regular morning report among physicians and nurses, and no\n\"on-call\" or physician duty logs are regularly kept.  Medical\nrecords are deficient in that important reports are misfiled and\ncannot be located.  Progress notes are illegible as well.  Such\nlapses in medical care delivery violate basic medical standards.\nIn the view of our consultants, most of these deficiencies\ncan be attributed to the absence of adeoruately trained medical\nprofessionals, including physicians and nurses.  The current:\nphysician staff is inadequately trained, organized and supervised\nto provide adequate medical care.  Sorr.e of the physicians have\nlittle training or experience in working with developrr.entally .\n\n-..-•-.)\n- 4 -\ndisabled persor.s and few protocols have been developed to provide\nguidelines to che staff.  For example, no protocols or procedures\nare in place cr. the subjects of tracking or managing emergencies,\naspirations, weight loss or gain, dysphagia, or seizures.\nPolicies regarding the frequency and tracking of tardive\ndyskinesia screenings and hepatitis vaccinations should be\ndeveloped.  Moreover, there has been little effort to provide\nmedical staff with continuing education.  The lack of trained\nmedical staff has significantly compromised medical care at GVDC -\nIn. sum, the' medical care system at GVDC is seriously\ndeficient.  Serious illnesses are not addressed in a timely\nmanner.  Preventable illnesses, unnecessary injuries, and other\ndebilitating conditions occur absent appropriate professional\nmedical intervention.\n3.  Physical and Nutritional Management\nMany residents at XSVDC are nutritionally at risk due to\nphysical disabilities or other medical problems and are not\nreceiving appropriate assistance and training during meals.\nFailure to appropriately position residents during meals can lead\nto aspiration, choking, reflux and other health complications.\nStaff who assist residents at mealtime must receive special\ntraining in order to ensure residents' health and safety.\nAlthough we observed one meal at which residents were generally\nbeing fed appropriately, on many other occasions we observed\nresidents eating in poor positions and the meal plans  (\"red\ncards\") that were available were often either not followed cr not\nappropriate for the particular resident for whom the plan was\ndeveloped.\nC. Physical Therapy and Positioning ofvPhysically\nHandicapped Residents\nPhysical therapy services at GVDC are seriously deficient.\nOne physical therapist for a population of over 600 residents, •\nmany of whom have physical disabilities and a related need for\nphysical therapy services, does not allow the provision of\nadequate and appropriate physical therapy services.  In fact,\nonly 72 residents are currently receiving such services in spite\nof the large number of residents in the GVDC population who\nrequire such services.  Ill-trained physical therapy technicians\nfail to fill the void left by the lack of an adequate number of\nphysical therapists.\nMoreover, our physical therapy consultant identified a\nsignificant number of dangerous practices being conducted by\nthose few individuals actually engaged in physical therapy\nactivities.  For example, technicians routinely failed to take\nsimple precautions such as locking wheelchairs from which\nresidents were transferred to a position for walking.  Review of\n\n- 5 -\nincident reports shows that approximately 13 percent of the\ninjuries reported resulted from inappropriate handling of\nresidents during transfer or in use of their wheelchair.  No\ntechnician ostensibly providing physical therapy was observed\nendeavoring to teach residents any skills.  Technicians used the\nsame walker for multiple residents with broad differences in gait\nand height.  Ir.deed, deficiencies in addressing the needs of\nresidents with physical disabilities, especially children, are so\nsevere as to represent an active threat to their health and\nsafety.\nAppropriate positioning for residents who have multiple\nphysical disabilities is necessary to prevent deterioration of\nresidents' skills, abilities, and health.  Our physical therapy\nconsultant made numerous observations of inadequately and\nimproperly positioned residents.  Many residents were observed in\nwheelchairs which did not adequately support them.  All sling\nseat and sling back chairs observed were inappropriate.  Chairs\nwere also not appropriately designed and constructed to manage\nscoliosis and other spinal malalignments.  Other chairs were\nsimply too small for the residents using them.  Physically\ndisabled residents not in wheelchairs were likewise observed to\nbe placed consistently in inappropriate positions.\nFurthermore, accurate and useful documentation of an\nindividual's physical therapy status does not exist, making it\nimpossible to evaluate whether any intervention was effective,\nineffective or in need of modification.  In fact, many residents\nreviewed were continued for years on the same programs with\nlittle or no progress noted, which would require a modification\nor at least a re-evaluation of the therapy provided.\nIn sum, physical therapy services, including the positioning\nof residents, are so deficient as to represent a direct threat of\nharm to residents.\nII.  Residents of GVDC Are Not Adequately Protected From Harm or\nthe Serious Risks of Harm Due to Lack of Supervision.\nDirect care staffing is so deficient that many GVDC\nresidents are harmed and are at substantial risk of harm because\nof the lack of adequate numbers of competent and qualified staff.\nOur observations and review of documents reveal that numerous\ninjuries occur to residents which staff do not observe as they\nhappen or do observe and fail to prevent.  Residents are\nrepeatedly \"found with blood\" on them from injuries that occur\noutside of staff supervision.  On other occasions, residents'\nsevere injuries are discovered only during bathing or at bedtirr.e.\nIn such instances, the staff report that they are unaware of the\ncause of the injuries.  Such a high degree of unexplained\ninjuries is unacceptable.\n\n- 6 -\nSeme residents at GVDC repeatedly engage in self-abusi%-e and\nother self-injurious behavior, such as serious head slapping or\ngouging their wounds.  For instance, one eleven year old boy\napparently lest Che sight in one eye from repeated headslapcir.g\nwhich resulted in a detached retina.  Other residents were noted\nwith swollen, disfigured features resulting from years of\nself-injury.  Still others had permanent scars from continual\nself-mutilation of their faces and arms.\nIncident reports detail a variety of unexplained and serious\nincidents and injuries at GVDC.  Although not all accidents can\nbe prevented, many of. the injuries suffered by GVDC residents are\npreventable products of inadequate staff supervision or\nintervention. 2./\nOver one third of the injuries reported in incident reports\n-- lacerations, fractures and bruises -- result from residents'\nbehaviors, including se}.f-injury and aggression.  Many of these\nincident/injury reports concluded with the notation that the\ninjury was \"unavoidable due to resident's behavior,\" reflecting\nthe facility's lack of confidence in. either the residents'\nability to learn alternative behaviors or in the facility's\ncapacity to provide appropriate supervision and training.  The\nmost frequent recommended response to these incidents is for\nstaff to encage in closer supervision.  Such supervision is\nimpossible given current staffing levels.\nThe number of unexplained injuries reflected in the incident\nreports is particularly disturbing because staff reported that\nminor injuries of unknown cause are intentionally not reported.\nAs such, the reported injuries do not reflect the entire range of\ninjuries of unknown origin.  Out of a sample of ten residents\nobserved during the tour as exhibiting recent notable injuries,\n6 0 percent of the residents had injuries for which no incident\nreport could be located.  Several other reports contained\ndescriptions of injuries that did not accurately reflect the\ninjury observed.\nIn sum, there is an unacceptable level of injury at GVDC.\nThe level of injuries of unknown origin is also greatly\ndisturbing.\n2.1 Approximately 40 percent of incident/injury reports\nreviewed shewed an injury due to falls.  Such injuries can be\ndivided into falls due to seizure activity, falls due to gait or\ninstability problems, particularly in cramped areas, or\naggression by other residents.  While some seizure-related falls\nmay be difficult to prevent, GVDC is aware of residents whose\ngait or behavior problems contribute to their falls and should be\nable to prevent many more of those injuries.\n\n. \\\n- 7 -\nIII.  Programs to Reduce Maladaptive Behavior and to Provide\nAdaptive Skills Are Inadequate or Non-existent, Subjecting\nResidents to Physical and Mental Harm.\nDeficiencies in the program services at GVBC, including both\nprograms designed to eliminate maladaptive and other anti-social\nbehaviors as well as programs to teach residents adaptive ar.d\nother skills, are significant.  Indeed, the deficiencies are so\nsevere that the absence of necessary programs subjects residents\nto harm and unreasonable risks of harm.  Furthermore, services do\nnot provide residents with the necessary skills to enhance their\nindependence or promote and maintain residents' physical and\nmental health.\nA.  Psychology Staff is Inadequate to Provide Necessary-\nServices\nGVDC currently has^ two doctoral level psychologists and\neight masters level \"psychological examiners.\"  Psychological\nexaminers are responsible for yearly evaluations of residents and-\nthe design and follow-up of individual behavior programs,\nincluding the training of direct care staff in the implementation\nof all programs.  At present, each psychological examiner has a\ncaseload of between SO and 90 residents -- far too many.  In\naddition, supervision of the psychological examiners by the Ph.D.\npsychologists is inadequate.  At present, there is insufficient\nprofessional expertise available at GVDC to develop and implement\nadequate training and behavior management programs.\n. B.  Behavior Programs Are Not Adequately Designed or\n• Implemented to Train Residents With Maladaptive Behaviors\nSignificantly, many residents who need behavior programs do\nnot have such programs.  Their destructive behaviors remain\nunaddressed.  For example, one resident had large scratches on\nher face that had been self-inflicted; our consultant\npsychologist was informed that there was no program to modify or\neliminate this unsafe behavior.  Staff described the wound on the\nforehead of another resident as a wound that the resident\nfrequently re-opens; there was no program to correct this\nbehavior and our consultant was advised that staff \"just leave it\nalone.\"  An older gentleman who had a history of pica  (eating\nforeign objects) documented in his record dating back to 1977 was\nobserved eating artificial grass and hitting his face; there is\nno program to correct these behaviors.  The failure of\nprofessional staff to develop and implement behavior programs to\naddress these and other dangerous behaviors represents a clear\ndanger to residents, and is unacceptable.\nThose behavior programs in place at GVDC, known as \"goal\nplans,\" fail to comport with generally accepted professional\nstandards in that they are not designed to accomplish changes in\n\n• - J\n- 8 -\nresidents' behavior or functional ability.  Few of the goal plans\nare accompanied by a professionally based functional analysis of\nthe resident's behavior --a necessary first step in the\ndevelopment cf a behavior program.  Absent an adequate\nassessment, ar. adequate behavior program cannot be developed.\nIn addition, the behavior programs at GVDC are not\nindividualized to meet the needs of the particular resider.es for\nwhom they have been developed.  Moreover, although staff reported\nthat all behavior programs and skill acquisition programs are\nmodified in the absence of progress, a review of records\nreflected many programs which had not been modified where no\nprogress had been shown for protracted periods of time.  Our\nconsultant also determined that the lack of reliable data or.\nresidents' adaptive and behavioral programs seriously compromised\nthe facility's training programs.  Finally, direct care staff\nhave not beer, adequately trained to implement training programs\nor to address the self-..injurious behavior exhibited by many\nresidents.\nC.  Adaptive Skills Training is Inadequate\nSimilar deficiencies also exist in the programs for the\ndevelopment of functional or adaptive skills.  Training programs\nshould focus on the acquisition of functional skills across a\nrange of settings, people, and target behaviors.  Training such\nas that at GVDC, which is often related to meaningless or\nisolated skills, does not enable the individual to acquire\ncontrol over his/her environment, affect the individual's quality\nof life, or promote independence.  Communication skills in\nparticular should receive much more emphasis than is currently\nprovided at GVDC and should be integrated throughout the\nresidents' activities.  While some of the communication boards\nand devices were excellent, many individuals who needed such\ndevices did not have them.  Our observation revealed few\ninstances where opportunity to work on communication skills was\npresented to the residents and even where such skills were being\npresented, the training was not individualized to the residents\ninvolved.  For example, a staff person was attempting to teach\nresidents with no verbal skills the word \"fork\" without either a\npicture board or an attempt to teach a sign.  Also, while a\ntoilet training team has been developed at GVDC, many residents\nwho could benefit from such training do not receive it.\n.A significant factor to the ineffectiveness of the\nprogramming at GVDC is the utter lack of reliable data being\ncollected or. residents' adaptive and behavioral programs.  During\nan entire week on-site at GVDC, we observed data being collected\non only two occasions.  The lack of reliable data makes it\nimpossible to determine the efficacy of programs and forces the\nresidents to lose valuable training time by remaining in\nineffective programming.\n\n- 9 -\nThe inadequacies in the development and implementation of\nbehavioral and ether training programs at GVDC exacerbates\nself-injurious behaviors, leads to needless injury, and otherwise\nharms the physical and mental health of residents.\nD.  Individual With Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA)\nThe school-aged children at the facility fail to recei\\-e a\nfree and appropriate public school education as required by the\nIDEA and its implementing regulations.  The IDEA requires that\nchildren with disabilities be educated with children who are\nnon-disabled \"to the-maximum extent appropriate.\"  The Individual\nEducation Flar.s  (IEPS) at GVDC do not reflect the need for the\nchildren who are not educated in the public schools to remain at\nthe institution for educational services.  The provision of\nservices for students aged 14-21 in a local elementary school is\nnot an appropriate placement for those individuals.  Moreover,\nphysical therapy and other services related to the provision of\nspecial education also fall far below accepted professional\npractices.  Physical therapy interventions which directly relate\nto the goals of students' individual education plans are not\nintegrated into each student's classroom activities.\nCommunication skills are not effectively addressed in current\nindividualized habilitation plans  (IHPs) and IEPs.  Opportunities\nfor training are also limited inappropriately in that objectives\nare written to require only limited trials of any particular\nskill.  In addition, many objectives do not appear to have a\nfunctional purpose for the individual student.\n, We note that most states have for many years declined to\ninstitutionalize children because institutional environments\nrepeatedly have been demonstrated to be harmful to the full\nemotional, physical, and intellectual development of\ndevelopmentally disabled children.  Such harm is particularly\nacute in a facility like GVDC where conditions consistently fail\nto meet legal and professional standards.\nIV.  GVDCs  Institutional Environment Fails to Meet the Needs of\nthe Residents.\nIn providing care and services to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, it is essential to furnish them with\nan acceptable and responsive environment that ensures safety, and\npromotes learning, development, and their overall well-being.\nSuch environments must be functional and serve to enhance the\nquality of life for the individuals.  Currently accepted\nprofessional standards require that this environment be the least\nseparate, most integrated setting where the individuals needs can\nbe met.  It must be safe, stable, and operate to teach and\nmaintain functional skills, to reduce or pre-empt the occurrence\nof behavior problems, and otherwise promote the independent\n\n- 10 -\nfunctioning of the individual.  GVDC meets none of these\nrequirements.\nThe environment at GVDC is not fully functional for its\nresidents and may be the cause of some of their problem\nbehaviors.  Ironically, it is the presence of these behavior\nproblems, the regression in skills experienced by many residents\nas the result of inadequate care, and the acuity of their\nphysical disabilities produced by other inadequate services that\ndecreases or delays the individuals' opportunity to live in and\nparticipate in community-based programs.\nGVDC is an isolated, self-contained environment which\nnecessarily separates its residents with disabilities from the\nrest of society.  As a result, the facility fails to provide its\nresidents treatment in an environment that permits contacts with\nsociety and its mainstream social institutions, enables\nindependent functioning,, and facilitates contact with family\nmembers.  While some few residents enjoy frequent community\noutings, many others have very few opportunities to participate\nin community activities and still others apparently never leave\nthe institution at all.  The State must provide these disabled\nresidents an opportunity to participate in or benefit from aids,\nbenefits and services equal to that afforded to others outside\nthe institution; more specifically, to those provided to other\nindividuals with disabilities in the State's established\ncommunity-based programs.. The residents are entitled to aids,\nbenefits and services that are as effective in affording them the\nequal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same\nbenefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as these\nserved in corr.munity-bassd programs.  By confining residents with\ndisabilities at GVDC, the State has failed to provide such\nservices in the least separate, rr.ost integrated setting as\nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1SS0, 42\nU.S.C. § 12101, et sea., and section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct of 1S73, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et sea.\nThe cases reviewed by our consultants indicate that all, or\nnearly all, of GVDC residents could be successfully placed in the\ncommunity if provided with adequate supports.  This view is not\ndisputed by the professionals at GVDC.  Keeping individuals in an\ninstitution who have been determined to be capable of living in\nthe comrriunity cannot be justified.\nV.  Remedial Measures\nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and ensure that the\nrights of GVDC residents are protected, the following remedial\nmeasures need to be implemented promptly.\na.  Hire, train and deploy adequate numbers of competent and\nqualified medical care staff, including physicians and nurses,-to\n\n- 11 -\nmeet the medical needs of the residents.  Provide enhanced\ntraining opportunities to the present physician staff to teach\nthen skills necessary to care for physically disabled,\ndevelopmentally disabled persons..  Increase the number of hours\nof consulting and contract professionals, especially these for\nneurology and psychiatry, to a level sufficient to provide\nadequate care.  Arrange for a physiatrist to provide regular\nconsultation.  Ensure (that enough adequately trained medical\nprofessionals, including nurses and pharmacists, are employed to\ninstitute appropriate quality assurance mechanisms, especially to\noversee the prescription, administration, and monitoring of\npsychotrcpic and anticonvulsant medications, and to provide\ntimely prevention, treatment and follow-up of medical problems.\nb.  Provide adequate ar.d timely medical care, including\nappropriate services to meet the acute, chronic and emergency\nmedical care needs of residents.  Ensure that physicians are\ni  ilbl  id  i  d  k\nc.  Residents on psychotropic or anticonvulsant medications\nshould be evaluated to determine the appropriateness of their\nprescriptions and whether these medications are being prescribed\nand monitored in accordance with accepted professional standards.\nPsychotropic medications must not be used without an adequate\nrationale and a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric diagnosis, nor as\npunishment, in lieu of a training program for behavior control,\nnor for the convenience of staff.  Residents must not be kept on\nanticonvulsant medications  (or inappropriate doses of those\nmedications) that serve no therapeutic purpose or are otherwise\ncontraindicated.  The practice of using standing \"FR^I\" orders for\npotent medications such as Ativan should be discontinued.\nd.  Medical records must be kept in a fashion sufficient to\nallow medical professionals to provide adequate and timely care.\nRegular communication among medical staff-must be established and\nenhanced.  An adequate system must be developed for tracking and\nmonitoring seizure disorders, and medical staff, as well as\ndirect care staff, should be adequately trained in seizure\nmanagement.\ne.  GVDC must hire, deploy and train sufficient numbers of\nspecialty service providers, including qualified physical\ntherapists, physical therapy technicians, occupational therapists\noccupational therapy assistants, and speech patholcgists, to\nensure that residents are provided appropriate physical ar.d\noccupational therapy, including positioning, the use of adaptive\ndevices, eating, and ambulation, and other functional skills\ntraining, including communication skills.\n\n- 12 -\nf.  GVDC -ust employ and deploy sufficient numbers of\ncompetent and trained professional and direct care staff to\nensure residents are supervised and adequately protected frc~\nharm and provided appropriate training and other services.\ng.  All residents must be evaluated to determine their\nindividual strengths and weaknesses and to develop appropriate\nindividualized training programs, including behavior mar.ager.e-t\nand skill acquisition programs.  Immediate attention must be\ngiven to residents with self-injurious, physically abusive and\nother destructive behaviors by identifying them and providing\nnecessary training on a priority basis.  All interdisciplinary\nevaluations should review the individual's training needs,\nutilizing a written descriptive functional analysis for those\nindividuals with problem behaviors, and emphasize alternatives to\nrestraints.  Programs should address and develop appropriate\nstrategies to promote the physical, mental, behavioral, and\nsocial skills of each resident and permit each resident to\nfunction as independently as possible.  Such programs must be\nconsistently implemented and procedures developed to ensure\nappropriate review and revision.\nh.  GVDC must develop and implement a professionally based,\nindividually appropriate data collection system to measure\nrelevant information about problem behaviors and the conditions\nunder which they occur, including, where appropriate, the\nfrequency, intensity, and duration of the behaviors.  GVDC must\nimplement an appropriate data collection system to ensure that\nadaptive and functional skills training is meeting the needs of\nthe ..resident involved.  Furthermore, GVDC must review and respond\nto the data collected relating to either behavior programs or\nskill acquisition programs in a timely and appropriate manner.\ni.  GVDC must ensure that each school-aged resident is\nevaluated and provided educational services, included related\naids and services, consistent with the requirements of IDEA.\nEvaluations should be coordinated with the appropriate public\nschool district to ensure that each child receives educational\nservices in the least restrictive, most appropriate, environment\noutside GVDC.  IEPs must be suitably individualized and contain\nfunctional objectives.\nj.  Immediate steps must be taken to develop and implement\nan overall plan to significantly reduce the size of the facility\nand to place residents in appropriate, less restrictive,\ncommunity-based programs.

Community Rehabilitation\nAgencies of Tennessee (CMRA) appeals the decisions of the two district courts that denied its petitions to\nintervene as a matter of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). Because CMRA's petitions are\nuntimely and it has not advanced any substantial right to intervene, its appeals are denied.\n591  I. BACKGROUND\n*591\nCMRA is an association of nonprofit agencies that provide services to retarded persons and those with mental\ndisabilities in community placements. These services include case management, residential medical support,\nsupported living, transportation, day services, and other services. CMRA represents the interests of the\ncommunity-based service provider industry in legislative, executive, and judicial matters. CMRA has 75 members,\nincluding most of the community agencies in the State of Tennessee. The vast majority of these community\nagencies is nonprofit, formed in local communities, and receives funding from the State and federal government.\nCMRA appeals the decisions of Judge Robert L. Echols in People First of Tennessee v. Clover Bottom\nDevelopmental Center and Judge Jon P. McCalla in United States v. State of Tennessee, that denied its motions\n[1]\nto intervene in the present litigation.  The two cases have been consolidated for purposes of this appeal. The\nunderlying lawsuits were brought by the United States and private plaintiffs against the State of Tennessee\nregarding the operation of its mental health system. In each case, CMRA alleged in its petition that the State of\nTennessee had violated the constitutional and statutory rights of individuals who are mentally retarded and\ndevelopmentally disabled. It attempted to intervene as of right and permissively in both cases pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and 24(b). CMRA only appeals the decisions that denied them the ability to\nintervene as of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a).\nWe will rely on the ample factual background provided in previous opinions in these two cases to describe the\nevents leading up to CMRA's attempt to intervene. See United States v. State of Tennessee, 181 F.3d 105\n(Table), 1999 WL 357785 (6th Cir.1999); People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., 145 F.3d 1332\n(Table), 1998 WL 246146 (6th Cir.1998); United States v. State of Tennessee, 925 F.Supp. 1292 (W.D.Tenn.\n1995); People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Ctr., 878 F.Supp. 97 (W.D.Tenn.1992).\nII. ANALYSIS\nCMRA contends that it was improperly denied the right to intervene in the two cases pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 24(a). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), an outsider may intervene as of right:\nUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action ... when the applicant\nclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the\n\napplicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as practical matter impair or impede\nthe applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately\nrepresented by existing parties.\nThe criteria that must be satisfied before intervention as of right will be granted are: (1) timeliness of the\napplication to intervene, (2) the applicant's substantial legal interest in the case, (3) impairment of the applicant's\n592 ability to protect that interest in the absence of intervention, and (4) inadequate representation of that interest \n*592 by parties already before the court. See Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th\nCir.1997).\nA district court's denial of intervention as of right is reviewed de novo, except for the timeliness element, which is\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1999) (citing Jansen v.\nCity of Cincinnati, 904 F.2d 336, 340 (6th Cir.1990)).\nA.Timeliness\nCMRA contends that now is the appropriate time to intervene and that it filed its motions timely because it learned\nshortly prior to bringing its motions that its interests were not being represented by the existing parties. We have\nidentified several factors to be established in determining whether a request for intervention is timely:\n(1) the point to which the suit has progressed; (2) the purpose for which intervention is sought; (3)\nthe length of time preceding the application during which the proposed intervenor knew or\nreasonably should have known of his interest in the case; (4) the prejudice to the original parties\ndue to the proposed intervenor's failure, after he or she knew or reasonably should have known of\nhis interest in the case, to apply promptly for intervention; and (5) the existence of unusual\ncircumstances militating against or in favor of intervention.\nGrubbs v. Norris, 870 F.2d 343, 345 (6th Cir.1989). \"The determination of whether a motion to intervene is timely\nshould be evaluated in the context of all relevant circumstances.\" Jansen, 904 F.2d at 340. We will find an abuse\nof discretion only when left with the \"definite and firm conviction that the court ... committed a clear error of\njudgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors\" or where it \"improperly applies the\nlaw or uses an erroneous legal standard.\" Huey v. Stine, 230 F.3d 226, 228 (6th Cir.2000) (citations and internal\nquotations omitted).\n1. Stage of the Proceeding\nCMRA contends that the district judges abused their discretion when they denied the motions to intervene. CMRA\nargues it did not become aware of its independent interest to intervene until the implementation of the settlement\nagreements required its members to provide community-based services to individuals without a guarantee of\nsufficient payment by the State of Tennessee. CMRA cites to Grubbs and Linton v. Commissioner, 973 F.2d 1311\n(6th Cir.1992), for the proposition that intervenors can timely appeal during the remedial stages of a consent\ndecree. See Grubbs supra; Linton, supra.\nWe have recently stated that the time of intervention is not the determining factor but rather that \"all\ncircumstances\" must be examined to determine the substantive progress that has occurred in the litigation. See \nStupak-Thrall v. Glickman, 226 F.3d 467, 475 (6th Cir.2000) (\"The propriety of intervention in any given case,\nhowever, must be measured under `all circumstances' of that particular case.\") (citing NAACP v. New York, 413\nU.S. 345, 366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2603, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973)). If the litigation has \"made extensive progress in the\ndistrict court before the appellants moved to intervene\" then this factor weighs against intervention. Id.\nIn these cases, there was very little for either district judge to do when CMRA filed its petitions for intervention. In \nPeople First, Judge Echols had conditionally approved the initial settlement; the parties had prepared the\n593 Community Development Plan required by him. He had approved this plan, and the motion for *593 final approval\nof the settlement was already pending before him. In United States v. Tennessee, Judge McCalla had approved\nseveral remedial orders to bring the mental health system into compliance with the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\n\nPersons Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997) and had approved the Community Plan. All substantive issues had been resolved\nby both judges at the time of CMRA's filing for intervention and all that was required was final approval by the\njudges. This factor weighs strongly against allowing intervention by CMRA. See Stupak-Thrall, 226 F.3d at 475.\n2. Purpose of the Intervention\nCMRA states that it simply requests the opportunity to be an active party in future remedial proceedings. CMRA\nwould like the opportunity to participate in the implementation of the settlement agreements, to advocate and\nprotect the regulatory and economic interests of community providers and to assure that sufficient other\nresources are provided in the community in a timely manner so that individuals receive timely and appropriate\nservices. CMRA contends that throughout the remedial phase the courts and the parties will address matters\nwhich will directly implicate the scope, quality, timing and funding of services to be performed by CMRA\nmembers.\nIn People First, Judge Echols found that this argument did not state an adequate \"purpose for the intervention.\"\nHe stated, \"Because it is the State's responsibility to assure that `resources are provided in the community' and\n`individuals receive timely and appropriate services,' intervention by CMRA would not accomplish these aims.\nFinally, should CMRA hope, through intervention, to obtain higher rates and fewer obligations for community\nproviders, this forum is not the appropriate forum to seek such relief.\"\nIn United States v. State of Tennessee, Judge McCalla held that \"These stated purposes do not rise to the level\nrequiring intervention.\" He held that, \"The State of Tennessee is responsible for ensuring that these interests are\nprotected and CMRA agencies are already participating in the implementation of the Remedial Order by providing\nservices to the class members.\"\nThe interests asserted by CMRA for seeking intervention are not compelling. This factor also weighs against a\nfinding of timely intervention.\n3. The length of time preceding the application during which the\nApplicant knew or should have known of its interest in the case.\nCMRA admits it knew of the litigation in both cases at all stages and it also knew that its members had an interest\nin the outcome of the litigation. It contends that it believed that the existing parties to the two cases adequately\nrepresented its interest initially, and thus, it was not required to intervene in the lawsuits. It now claims that it only\nrecently became apparent that these parties were not adequately representing its interest.\nIn People First, Judge Echols found that CMRA knew of the litigation at all stages and did not attempt to\nintervene when it knew that the interests of the community providers were affected by the litigation and proposed\nsettlement agreement. He stated:\nIt is undisputed that CMRA has been aware of the lawsuits, the time-consuming negotiations\nbetween the parties and interest groups, the disputed issues concerning the types, quality,\n594 location, and accessibility of the proposed community *594 health care services, along with the\ncritical role of the community health care providers in providing these services to the State of\nTennessee for the benefit of the Plaintiffs. Investigations, reports, judicial settlement conferences,\nand hearings have been conducted.\nHe held that this factor weighed against allowing intervention.\nIn United States v. State of Tennessee, Judge McCalla also found that this factor weighed against allowing\nCMRA to intervene. He stated:\nCMRA's interest developed, at the latest date, when the Community Plan was entered, which was\nin 1997. The fiscal crisis of the State and other referenced broken promises of the State do not\n\nchange the fact that CMRA's interests, even broadly construed, were apparent, at the latest date,\nwhen the Community Plan went into effect.\nHe held that CMRA waited too long before intervening.\nWe agree with the decisions of the district courts. An entity that is aware that its interests may be impaired by the\noutcome of the litigation is obligated to seek intervention as soon as it is reasonably apparent that it is entitled to\nintervene. See NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. at 367, 93 S.Ct. at 2604; Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co. v. Tracy, 6 F.3d\n389, 396 (6th Cir.1993); Stotts v. Memphis Fire Dep't, 679 F.2d 579, 584 & n. 3 (6th Cir.1982) (applicants \"should\nhave attempted to intervene when they first became aware of the action, rather than adopting a `wait-and-see'\napproach\"). Given that the settlement agreements specifically address training and the delivery of services in the\ncommunity, \"it would not have required unusual prescience on the part of the intervenors to recognize that their\ninterests were implicated\" when the decree was first proposed. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., 6 F.3d at 396. This\nfactor weighs against timely intervention by CMRA.\n4. Prejudice to the Parties\nCMRA claims that there is no prejudice to the parties because CMRA does not dispute any issues in the present\nsettlement agreements. The district judges concluded that allowing intervention at this late stage of the\nproceeding would add a complicated issue to the litigation. They held that the issues raised by CMRA went\nbeyond the scope of the suit's initial focus on the constitutional issue and statutory rights of developmentally\ndisabled residents of state facilities and would require considerable time and expense unnecessary in light of\nCMRA's access to other fora for resolution of its concern. While CMRA has agreed not to dispute the terms of the\nsettlement agreements, it has not made the same promise as to the remedial plans, the drafting of which involved\nthe participation of more than 2100 stakeholders over many months. There is a risk, to the extent CMRA seeks to\nintervene to discuss reimbursement rates, payment methodologies, or any other items on its list of grievances,\nthat prejudice against the other parties will occur; such attempts may force the parties into collateral litigation over\neconomic issues in cases that have already settled the merits of plaintiffs' claims. See Bradley v. Milliken, 828\nF.2d 1186, 1194 (6th Cir.1987). This factor also weighs against CMRA's intervention.\n5. Unusual Circumstances\nIn People First, CMRA admits that there are no unusual circumstances supporting intervention. In United States\nv. Tennessee CMRA contends there are unusual circumstances because of the pending appeals and active\n595 proceedings concerning compliance with the district court's orders. However, nothing in these *595 proceedings\nhas any effect on CMRA directly. The State of Tennessee, not the CMRA, is ultimately responsible for the funding\nof its mental health system to comply with the United States Constitution, federal statutes, and the courts' orders.\nCMRA has not shown that any of the factors that determine timeliness of intervention weigh in favor of allowing it\nto intervene this late in either lawsuit. Therefore, we are left with a \"definite and firm conviction that the courts ...\ndid not commit a clear error of judgment.\" Huey, 230 F.3d at 228.\nB. Whether CMRA has a substantial legal interest in the subject matter\nof the pending litigation, which may be impaired.\nCMRA claims that it has a substantial interest in this litigation because of its economic interest in how community\nservice programs are funded and because of the lock-in procedure established in the settlement agreements that\naffect how community-based services are provided. We have held, that:\n[I]n this circuit we subscribe to a \"rather expansive notion of the interest sufficient to invoke\nintervention of right.\" Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th Cir.1997). For\nexample, an intervenor need not have the same standing necessary to initiate a lawsuit. See id.; \nPurnell v. City of Akron, 925 F.2d 941, 948 (6th Cir.1991). We have also \"cited with approval\n\ndecisions of other courts `rejecting the notion that Rule 24(a)(2) requires a specific legal or\nequitable interest.'\" Miller, 103 F.3d at 1245 (quoting Purnell, 925 F.2d at 948). \"The inquiry into\nthe substantiality of the claimed interest is necessarily fact specific.\" Id.\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1999). We review the decisions of the district courts de novo to\ndetermine whether they properly held that CMRA did not establish a substantial interest in the litigation. See \nStupak-Thrall, 226 F.3d at 471.\nFirst, CMRA points to its economic interest in assuring adequate funding for implementation of the settlement\nagreements and its contractual rights in agreements with the State to provide community-based services. The\nparties to these lawsuits have entered into consent decrees aimed at guaranteeing that Tennessee provide at\nleast the minimum level of care to developmentally disabled individuals required by federal law. CMRA does not\nchallenge the terms of these agreements or contend that they fall below what federal law requires. CMRA is only\nconcerned with the level of funding provided by the State to community-based service providers. CMRA's\nclaimed interest does not concern the constitutional and statutory violations alleged in the litigation, but rather\nhow much its members get paid for providing services. CMRA has an interest in the economic component of the\nsettlement but the consent decrees obligate the State, not CMRA, to fund community services adequately. By the\nterms of the settlement agreements, it is the responsibility of the State of Tennessee to provide adequate and\nappropriate community services to members of the plaintiff class. Implementation of the settlement agreement\ndoes not alter CMRA's economic interests with the State to provide support and services to the class members\nnor its ability to negotiate the terms of these contracts. Further, as found by both district court judges, CMRA can\nprotect its economic interests in contract negotiations with the State by lobbying the legislative and executive\n596 branches for favorable funding *596 arrangements, and in state courts by suing to enforce its contractual rights.\nSecond, CMRA claims to have a sufficient interest in the litigation because of the lock-in provision in the Provider\nAgreement. The Provider Agreement provision at issue states:\nOnce a Contractor is serving a person on the supported living medical, supported living enhanced\nor supported living behavioral rates, the Contractor must continue to provide services and may not\ndischarge or deny services to that person without permission of the State pursuant to TCA\n33-1-202(c).\nProvider Agreement ¶ E.17. CMRA relies on this court's decision in Linton v. Commissioner of Health and\nEnvironment, 30 F.3d 55 (6th Cir.1994), where we held that intervention was appropriate because individual\nnursing homes had a substantial interest in a suit involving a State plan to remedy violations of the Medicaid Act.\nIn Linton, contracts between the State and nursing homes contained a lock-in provision that prohibited providers\nfrom opting out of the State's Medicaid system until the last patient voluntarily left the nursing home. Id. at\n1315-16. This provision effectively precluded the nursing homes from terminating their membership in Medicaid. \nId. at 1317. We reversed the district court in Linton and held that the effect of the lock-in violated the contractual\nand statutory rights of nursing homes and gave the nursing homes a substantial interest in the litigation to justify\nintervention. Id. at 1315-16, 1319.\nIn People First and the United States v. State of Tennessee, the district judges held that the lock-in provision in\ntheir cases did not have the same effect as in Linton and did not justify a substantial interest in this case to allow\nintervention. First, the agreements in these cases allow the service provider to petition the State to terminate or\nmodify services to the mentally retarded or those with mental disabilities, and thereby do not create a permanent\nobligation as is the case in Linton. Second, the lock-in provision in the cases before us does not establish an\nindefinite obligation on service providers to contract with the State as in Linton. Third, the community-based\nservice providers voluntarily entered into contracts with the State and remain free to renegotiate all aspects of its\ncontracts with the State of Tennessee.\nCMRA's economic interest and its interest in the lock-in provision do not reach the level of requisite substantial\ninterest required to intervene.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\nCMRA has not satisfied the requirements to intervene as of right because it was not timely in bringing its motions\nand did not establish an adequate substantial interest in either lawsuit. Because it has not established these\nnecessary elements, we do not analyze the claims of impairment of the applicant's ability to protect its interest in\nthe absence of intervention, and whether CMRA's interest is inadequately represented by the parties already\nbefore the court. See Michigan State AFL-CIO, 103 F.3d at 1245.\nThe judgments of the district courts are AFFIRMED.\n[*] The Honorable John Feikens, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] In People First, Judge Echols held that CMRA did not timely file its motion to intervene and, even if it had, the\norganization has no substantial interest in the litigation. In United States v. Tennessee, Judge McCalla held that\nCMRA lacked a substantial interest in the litigation, and in the alternative, held that the organization had not\ntimely filed its motion to intervene. For purposes of this appeal this distinction makes little difference.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This Settlement Agreement is entered into by People\nFirst of Tennessee, the United States of America  (\"Plaintiffs\"),\nand the State of Tennessee  (\"State Defendants\").  The Plaintiff,\nPeople First of Tennessee, asserts a class consisting of all\npersons who presently reside or will reside at Clover Bottom\nDevelopmental Center  (including the Harold Jordan Center), Greene\nValley Developmental Center or Nat T. Winston Developmental\nCenter, and all persons who have resided there at any time since\nDecember 22, 1992.  The parties agree to the certification of\nthis class.  This Settlement Agreement sets forth provisions for\nrestructuring and enhancing Tennessee's state-wide system for the\ndelivery of services to citizens who reside or have resided as of\nDecember 1992, or who will reside in the State's three regional\ndevelopmental centers:  Clover Bottom Developmental Center\n(including the Harold Jordan Center), Nashville; Greene Valley\nDevelopmental Center, Greenville; and Nat T. Winston\nDevelopmental Center, Bolivar, Tennessee  (hereinafter\n\"citizens\").  The State Defendants hereby agree to take the\nfollowing actions to guarantee protection of the federal\nstatutory and constitutional rights of these citizens.\nB.  This Agreement draws upon the initial settlement\nagreement proposed by People First of Tennessee and the remedial\nplans developed and activities undertaken by State Defendants,\nincluding the Tennessee Quality Initiative  (\"TQI\"), and\n\nrepresents a consensus of the parties as to the most appropriate\nmeans of providing services to Tennessee citizens with\ndevelopmental disabilities.\nC.  This Agreement, voluntarily entered into by the parties,\nshall be enforceable as an order of the Court by the parties and\nany member of the class approved by the Court.  This Agreement is\nlegally binding on and judicially enforceable by the parties as\nprovided herein and it shall be applicable to and binding upon\nall of the parties, their officers, agents, employees, assigns\nand successors.  This Agreement may not be used as evidence of\nliability in any other civil proceeding and is enforceable only\nby the parties.\nII•  Preamble and Guiding Principles\nThe parties enter into this Settlement Agreement recognizing\nthat their overriding common interest is in assuring that\nTennessee's citizens with developmental disabilities are provided\nreasonable opportunities to grow and develop, exercise\nindependence, and lead full and productive lives in a safe\nenvironment.  This Agreement requires the restructuring and\nenhancement of Tennessee's state-wide delivery of services to\nthese citizens in a way that recognizes the individuality of each\ncitizen and understands the critical role of family members,\nguardians, and others who provide support and care.  The\nfollowing guiding principles are intended only to be used to aid\nin the interpretation of the operative provisions of the\nAgreement, and are not intended to function as independently\n- 2 -\n\nenforceable standards for meeting the terms of this Agreement.\nToward these ends, the parties acknowledge the following guiding\nprinciples.\nA.  Each citizen must be provided services in the least\nseparate, most integrated setting appropriate to meet his or her\nindividual needs.\nB.  All decisions regarding services for citizens must be\nperson-centered, driven by the individual citizens, family\nmembers, guardians, advocates, and other interested persons, and\nmade on an individualized basis by appropriate interdisciplinary\nteams of competent and qualified professionals with input from\nthose persons.\nC.  Tennessee's programs and services must be designed to\nprovide all citizens the reasonable opportunity to grow, develop,\nexercise independence, and to live full and productive lives.\nD.  Tennessee recognizes the need to provide services to\neach citizen in his or her home communities and to provide a\nbroad array of living environments and services, including homes\nadapted to individual needs, health care and therapy, work at\nregular, meaningful, and compensated employment, opportunities to\ndevelop relationships with family, friends, neighbors,\nco-workers, helpers and support staff and community\norganizations, and participation in community activities.\nE.  All citizens must direct their own lives and be enabled\nto make meaningful choices about matters that are important to\nthe person.  Decisions about services and supports for each\n- 3 -\n\ncitizen shall be made by the citizen with the support of parents,\nguardians, friends and advocates.\nF.  All programs developed pursuant to this Agreement shall\nbe fully adequate to meet the needs of citizens served by them.\nNo citizen shall be placed in a program which does not fully meet\nhis or her needs and fully protect his or her health and\nwell-being.\nG.  All citizens must be provided with adequate and\nappropriate health care services and such specialized health care\nservices as may be needed to ensure their health and well-being.\nH.  All citizens must be protected from harm and\nunreasonable risks of harm and be protected from unnecessary\nphysical and chemical restraint.\nI.  Each child covered by this Agreement must be provided a\nfree, appropriate public school education in the least\nrestrictive, most integrated setting appropriate to his or her\nneeds in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1485.  From the date of filing\nthis Agreement, no child shall be removed from the regular\neducational environment as long as the child's education can\nsatisfactorily be achieved in a regular class with supplementary\naids, services and support.\nJ.  All citizens, their families, guardians,\ncare-givers and support personnel must be educated about their\nrights and responsibilities, and how to exercise them.  All\ncitizens shall be allowed to exercise their constitutional\n- 4 -\n\nrights.  In addition, all of these individuals must be provided\ncurrent information about all available resources and programs,\nand how to access them.\nK.  The quality of supports and services, consumer\nsatisfaction, and the prevention of abuse and neglect is best\nassured by educated and involved citizens, family members, and\nother individuals who provide supports and services for the\ncitizens.\nL.  State Defendants agree that a system of accountability,\nquality assurance and monitoring necessary to implement this\nAgreement, including quality control systems with internal\nmonitoring; case management, investigations and data collection,\nare essential to maintaining quality and obtaining favorable\noutcomes.\nM.  Implementation of this Agreement will be most successful\nif there is good communication and collaboration among citizens,\nfamilies, advocates, guardians, private service providers and\ngovernment.\nN.  Resources and expertise now lacking at Tennessee's\ninstitutions need to be developed on an expedited basis to ensure\nthat the rights of citizens are protected.\n0.  Each citizen will have a reasonable opportunity to\nchoose from appropriate service providers, his or her living\nenvironments, his or her roommates, and his or her qualified\nsupport staff.\n- 5 -\n\nP.  In the event a community placement is inappropriate for\na citizen, the State will provide an appropriate alternative\nplacement and service system to meet the citizen's needs.\nIll.  State Planning, Implementation and Oversight\nA.  The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation  (DMHMR) will continue to implement the statewide\ninitiative embodied in the TQI.  The Director of the TQI shall be\na state employee.  Within the structure of TQI, one individual\nwill be assigned to coordinate statewide activity in each of the\nfollowing content areas:  Monitoring and Evaluation; Protection\nfrom Harm; Medical Care; Physical and Nutritional Management;\nBehavior Intervention; Habilitation; Physical Environment;\nCommunity Placement; Investigations of Alleged Abuse, Serious\nAccidents and Injuries, and Other Alleged Staff Misconduct; and\nEducational Services for School Age Children.\nB.  There will be a TQI Coordinator at each developmental\ncenter and at each regional Office of Community Services.  The\nState Defendants shall assure that the central office of DMHMR\nand its regional Offices of Community Services  (OCS) are\nsufficiently staffed to meet the requirements of this Agreement.\nTo that end, within 30 days of filing this Agreement with the\nCourt, the State Defendants shall conduct a needs assessment and\ndevelop a plan for the assignment and/or acquisition of staff for\nthe central and regional offices to meet the requirements of this\nAgreement.\n- 6 -\n\nC.  The TQI Director will be responsible for coordinating\nand monitoring compliance with all provisions of this Agreement\nand will identify variance within the system for timely\ncorrection.\nD.  State Defendants shall identify staff at the central and\nregional offices who will have responsibility for providing\ninformation about implementation of this Agreement and for\nresponding to questions and communications from citizens,\nfamilies and guardians.  State Defendants shall publicize the\nnames, office telephone numbers and responsibilities of these\npersons to all citizens, their families and guardians, and to all\nappropriate public agencies and private organizations and their\npersonnel.  State Defendants shall coordinate their information\nand public relations activities at the central and regional level\nwith the DMHMR Office of Public Information and Education  (OPIE).\nE.  State Defendants shall employ within one year of the\nsigning of this Agreement, a well qualified and experienced\ndevelopmental medicine physician to 1) exercise clinical\nsupervision of the developmental center physicians,\n2) participate in the selection, evaluation, and retention of\nmedical specialists and other physicians, 3) provide ongoing\nin-service and individual consultation to the developmental\ncenter physicians and community physicians, and 4) participate in\nthe transition planning for all citizens returning to the\ncommunity from the developmental centers.  This individual will\n- 7 -\n\nbe different from the person identified in paragraph IIIA above\nwho is responsible for Health Care under TQI.\nF.  State Defendants agree to make all reasonable efforts to\npursue all sources of available federal and state funding to\nsupport the execution of their responsibilities under this\nAgreement.  In selecting among alternatives that meet 1) the\nrequirements of this Agreement, 2) the requirements of federal\nstatutes, and 3) the professional judgment standard for\nconstitutionally appropriate levels of care, it is agreed that it\nis appropriate for the State Defendants to consider the\navailability of resources, the cost-effectiveness of various\nprogrammatic and service options, e.g. the State's Home and\nCommunity-Based Waiver under Medicaid, and the overall burden on\nthe State's budget.\nG.  The DMHMR will work with colleges, universities and\nUniversity Affiliated Programs  (UAPs) in the State of Tennessee\nto facilitate the -establishment of courses of instruction and\ncurricula designed to develop a pool of paraprofessionals and\nprofessionals with skills needed to provide effective services to\ncitizens.\nH.  State Defendants shall collect data, and maintain\nrecords and recordkeeping systems adequate and appropriate to\neffectuate the terms of this Agreement.  In this regard, State\nDefendants shall design and implement a statewide system for\ntracking outcomes for citizens in the service system, as well as\nother statewide data collection systems provided for herein.\n- 8 -\n\nIV.  Evaluations and Assessment\nA.  Person-Centered Evaluations of Individual Citizens\n1.  Each individual citizen must receive a\ncomprehensive person-centered evaluation of all of his or her\nindividual medical, behavioral, habilitation and treatment needs,\nby competent professionals who are members of the IDT.  Each\ncitizen who is not recommended for community placement by the IDT.\nmust also receive an evaluation for community placement conducted\nby professionals independent of the Department of Mental Health\nand Mental Retardation who are agreed upon by the parties.\nCollectively, these evaluations will form the basis for each\ncitizen's Individualized plans, including Individual Support and\nTransition Plans  (described herein at Section V.A.) and the\nhealth care and behavioral support plans that supplement the\nIndividual Support and Transition Plans.\n2.  These person-centered assessments must be\ncomprehensive and must analyze what is important to the citizen,\nhis or her vision of the future, and his or her medical,\nbehavioral, vocational, social and spiritual needs.  They must\ndraw upon communications with the individual being evaluated and\nfamily members or guardians, discussions with friends, support\nstaff, and professionals familiar with the individual, the known\nmedical, behavioral and social histories of the individual, and,\nwhen appropriate, evaluations from expert consultants.  All\nassessments made pursuant to this section shall be based upon the\nindividual needs and choices of the citizen and not on present\n- 9 -\n\navailability of services.  Any member of the IDT may make\nadditional recommendations for necessary services for the citizen\nand such additional recommendation(s) shall be submitted to the\nQuality Review Panel  (as defined in Section X.A. below).  The IDT\nmay state its reasons for declining the recommendation(s).  In\nsuch instances, the Administrator of the institution shall be\ninformed of any necessary treatment decisions.\nB.  Assessment of Existing Services and Supports\n1.  State Defendants must make a comprehensive\nassessment of the services and supports needed by all citizens\nand a companion analysis of resources presently available in the\ncommunity to meet these needs.  This analysis shall form the\nbasis of the Community Development Plan  (as discussed in V.C.)\nfor expanding or developing the full range of needed services.\nV.  Development of Plans. Services and Supports\nA.  Development of Individual Support and Transition Plans\n1.  Each citizen will have a person-centered  Individual\nSupport Plan (ISP) and, if appropriate, an Individual Transition\nPlan  (ITP)  (collectively referred to as Individual Support and\nTransition Plans  (ISTPs)).  An Individual Support Plan is the\ndocument that reflects the person's vision of a desired life.\nEach ISP shall be based on an individual assessment and include a\ndescription of the person's current life, functioning, a\nstatement of the outcomes necessary to achieve the person's\ndesired life, and a description of the actions, supports and\nservices required and the persons and providers responsible for\n- 10 -\n\nachieving the desired outcomes.  These plans will be developed by-\nteams consisting of the individual citizen, family members,\nguardians, knowledgeable support staff, advocates and appropriate\nprofessionals, including professionals with expertise in\ndeveloping and implementing such plans, as well as any person\nrequested by the citizen.  The State Defendants shall make\nreasonable accommodation(s) to include all such persons and must\nactively seek the input of these persons.  The ISP will focus on\nthe individual's needs, reflecting the value of supporting the\nperson with relationships, productive work, participation in\ncommunity life, personal decision-making, and training to become\nas self-sufficient as possible.  When significant changes occur\nin a citizen's life situation, corresponding changes shall be\nmade in the citizen's supports and services and shall be\nreflected in the ISTP.\n2.  The planning process will result in a written plan\ncontaining a detailed description of the identity, location,\nfrequency and duration of the services and supports needed by the\nindividual.  Each citizen will choose his or her community\nservice providers from available and qualified community service\nproviders.  The process will be coordinated by an Independent\nSupport Coordinator  (case manager).\n3.  Each citizen and his or her parent(s) or legal\nguardian(s) shall participate in the development of the\nIndividual Support and Transition Plans (\"ISTPs\") as members of\nthe IDT.  As members of the interdisciplinary team, and as\n- 11 -\n\nimportant participants, the input of citizens and parents or\nguardians shall be encouraged and respected by the other members\nof the team.\n4.  Each citizen and his or her parent(s) or legal\nguardian(s) shall be informed of the recommendations of the\nindependent evaluation and the IDT, including all feasible\nalternatives to the provision of services in a developmental\ncenter.  Each citizen and his or her parent(s) or legal\nguardian(s) shall be informed of their freedom of choice\nregarding participation in the Medicaid home and community-based\nwaiver.  The State Defendants shall ensure that this freedom of\nchoice is offered and honored as required by federal Medicaid\nregulations.  The State Defendants shall ensure that the citizens\nare provided services that meet the citizens' individual needs as\nset out in the ISTP.\n5.  State Defendants will ensure that citizens are\nplaced in an appropriate and safe manner and that placements in\nthe community are adequate to meet the needs of the individuals\nas presented in their ISTP.  The nature of an individual's\ndisability will not be a factor in the eligibility of that\nindividual for community placement consideration.  No citizen\nwill be placed in a nursing home or board and care home unless\napproved by the Quality Review Panel and agreed to by the\nparties.\n6.  Each ISTP shall specify in detail the services and\nsupports needed, including at home, in day activities or work and\n- 12 -\n\nthe specialized medical services, to serve the individual citizen\nin the community.  All services and supports shall be integrated\ninto the community to the maximum extent possible to implement\neffectively the ISTP.  Transition services, such as home visits\nand overnights, as well as any other steps that need to be taken\nto ensure an orderly and smooth transition for the citizen, must\nalso be included in the ISTP.  All staff involved in the\ntransition process must be familiar with the individual who is\nmoving.\n7.  Pre-service training for community staff must\ninclude:  (a) First aid, CPR and the Heimlich maneuver;\n(b) general fire safety and evacuation;  (c) incident reporting;\n(d) training specific to the needs of the individual.  Within\nsixty  (60) days of the date of employment, a community staff\nmember's training must include:  (a) individual rights and the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act; (b) values and principles of TQI\nand this Agreement;  (c) program planning and implementation;\n(d)  principles of behavioral support; and  (e) prevention and\nreporting of abuse and neglect.  No citizen who is medically or\nbehaviorally at risk shall live in a residence unless at least\none staff person is on duty who is trained in first aid, CPR and\nthe Heimlich maneuver.\n8.  For school age children, the ISTP shall also\ninclude a statement of the educational program, including related\nservices and transportation services, to be provided each child.\nNo child shall move to the community without an agreed-upon\n- 13 -\n\nIndividual Education Program  (IEP).  Placement notice consistent\nwith the applicable state policy and procedure manual shall be\nobtained.  The State Defendants must ensure that the placement is\ncapable of providing the educational services required by the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-\n1485 and the citizen's IEP and must coordinate such placement\nwith the local educational agency.  Educational services to\ncitizens must comply with all applicable federal and Tennessee\nstate laws with regard to special educational services to\ndisabled children.  All placements of children in residential\nsettings must also comply with all applicable Tennessee state\nlaws with -regard to special educational services to disabled\nchildren.  All children should live with families.\n9.  State Defendants shall ensure that the community\nplacement for each and every citizen meets the individual needs\nof the citizen, as identified in the ISTP.  Under no\ncircumstances will the speed or type of a placement be governed\nby anything other than the interests of the citizen being placed.\nState Defendants may use existing community program vacancies\nonly where they have determined that the program meets the needs\nof the citizen as identified in the ISTP.  State Defendants shall\ncreate or contract for a community program that meets the needs\nof the citizen as identified in the ISTP.\n10.  The provision of community services and supports\nto citizens shall be informed/guided by the scope of services\nprovisions and the funding allocations set out in the State's\n- 14 -\n\nHome and Community-Based Waiver under Medicaid which shall be\nwritten to support the execution of the State Defendants'\nresponsibilities under this Agreement.  The scope of services\nprovisions and funding allocations under the Waiver shall not\napply where the community services and supports required by an\nindividual citizen under this Agreement cannot be met through the\nWaiver, where compliance with this Agreement can be achieved by\npursuing other sources of federal funding, or in the event that\nsubstantial modifications in the federal Medicaid program\nsignificantly change the terms of the Waiver.\n11.  For each citizen at the developmental centers, an\nindividualized transition profile will be developed by the IDT.\nThe transition profiles will contain at least the following\nelements:  1) citizen's name, age, and sex; 2) communication\nability/method/primary language; 3) diagnoses; 4) intellectual\nlevel and adaptive behavior level; 5) mobility; 6) hearing/vision\nacuity and dental status; 7) mealtime patterns and nutritional\nstatus; 8) type and frequency of supervision; 9) environmental\nadaptations/security needs; 10) general health condition and\nchronic and emergency health care needs; 11) preferred number and\ncharacteristics of housemates; 11) preferred geographic location;\n12) a description of the person's important relationships and the\nname, location and frequency of contact of family and significant\nothers; 13) anticipated adjustment issues; (14) supports and\nservices needed for the individual's safety; (15) the person's\nvision for the future; (16) a description of the individual's\n- 15 -\n\npersonality, skills and interests; 17) the \"non-negotiables\" for\nthe person, that is, the things that person must have to be happy\nand that, if not available, would result in obvious distress;\n18) the person's spiritual and religious preferences; 19) the\nperson's support needs; and 20) the person's vocational\ninterests.\n12.  The ISTP and the Independent Support Coordinator's\n(ISC) placement certification for each citizen will be filed with\nthe Quality Review Panel.  The Quality Review Panel will review\neach individual placement prior to such placement occurring.  The\nPanel shall complete its review and report to the IDT within\ntwenty  (20) days of receiving the ISTP and certification from the\nIDT unless the Panel requests additional time for a particular\nplacement.  The Panel's review will include review of relevant\nsupporting documentation and issues raised by members of the IDT.\nSuch reviews shall determine the adequacy of the placement and\nensure that the placement meets the individual needs of each\ncitizen.  Where the Panel determines that there are major\ndeficiencies with a placement, the placement shall not occur\nuntil all the identified major deficiencies are corrected.  Any\nother deficiencies shall be corrected in a timely manner.\n13.  Community placements shall provide a safe and\nhumane environment in which individuals are provided daily\nopportunities to learn, develop and maintain skills.  All\nservices, including medical and other health related services\nincluding, but not limited to, physical therapy, occupational\n- 16 -  •\n\ntherapy, necessary technology, dental, speech, visual, hearing,\nnutrition, and psychology, must be adequate and appropriate to\nmeet the individual needs of the citizens.\nB.  Development and Enhancement of Community Programs\nand Resources\n1.  State Defendants will provide each citizen\nappropriate developmental services in the most integrated setting\nconsistent with his or her needs, and in a manner which promotes\nindependence, enhances dignity and is as consistent as possible\nwith the Guiding Principles of this Agreement.\n2.  State Defendants shall develop community living\narrangements for all citizens residing at the institutions for\nwhom such living arrangements are called for by the\nindividualized evaluations set forth in Section IV. A, above,\ntogether with the community services necessary to provide the\ncitizens with adequate medical care and supports and services, as\ndefined by the individual person-centered evaluations and\nplanning process that is consistent with professional judgment,\nuntil such time as the citizen no longer is in need of such care\nand services.\n3.  State Defendants shall develop a support\ncoordination system sufficient to ensure that the needs of each\ncitizen placed in a community-based program pursuant to this\nAgreement are consistently reviewed and met.  A description of\nthis system shall be provided to the parties within thirty (30)\ndays of the filing of this Agreement with the Court.  Each\ncitizen shall have an Independent Support Coordinator.\n- 17 -\n\nIndependent Support Coordination will be provided by individuals\nor organizations who are independent of the provision of direct\nservice.  No individual Support Coordinator may provide services\nto more than 3 0 persons.  If a citizen requests a different\nSupport Coordinator, State Defendants will take all reasonable\nmeasures to meet that request.\n4.  State Defendants shall provide or can contract for\nadequate and appropriate training to the Individual Support\nCoordinators and to members of interdisciplinary teams in\nperson-centered planning and individual support coordination, and\nin methods of eliciting active involvement in the process of\npersons who use services and their families, and in the functions\nof Individual Support Coordination.\n5.  Independent Support Coordinators will be in\nregular, frequent contact with the people on their caseload in\ntheir homes, day activities and work sites.  Coordinators will\nobserve participation in programs and therapeutic interventions\nand will evaluate the degree to which services in the\nindividualized plan are being delivered, and whether quality and\noutcomes are achieved.  In no event will ISCs visit each of their\nassigned citizens less than once every three weeks.\n6.  State Defendants shall 1) employ expert consultants\nin the area of specialized transition for individuals with\nchallenging behaviors and dual diagnoses and for individuals with\nsignificant medical needs, and 2) implement the recommendations\nof these experts in the transition process.\n- 18 -\n\n7.  State Defendants shall develop and implement a\nsystem to evaluate an individual's physical/medical status prior\nto, during, and after the transition from the developmental\ncenters.  State Defendants shall also develop and implement a\ncomprehensive plan for the provision of health care to citizens\nliving in the community.  The plan shall specify a variety of\nstrategies to ensure that all citizens are provided adequate\nmedical and related services.\n8.  State Defendants shall develop and implement a\ncomprehensive plan for mental health services, including\ninpatient services, medications practice and behavioral support,\nas well as\" the availability of necessary professional services.\nThis plan shall focus on training and developing expertise in\nthis area among professionals, and expanding a crisis\nintervention system in each region to include emergency response\nand temporary augmented staff.\n9.  State Defendants shall develop an emergency respite\nservice system in each region for children and adults.  In their\nfirst six-month report to the Court and the parties, State\nDefendants shall include their plan for developing an emergency\nrespite service system in each region for children and adults.\nThis plan shall include specific action steps to be taken to\nexpand any such capacity already available in each region and how\nthat capacity will be accessed and utilized.  Wherever possible,\nemergency respite supports will be provided in the citizen's own\nhome.\n- 19 -\n\n10.  The State Defendants shall inform the citizen\nand/or his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) about his or her\noption to request a temporary six-month hold on a development\ncenter bed.  If requested by a citizen and/or his or her\nparent(s) or guardian(s), at the time of the initial community\nplacement, the State Defendants will hold a bed in a\ndevelopmental center for six months thereafter, as close to the\ncitizen's home county as possible, for as long as the State\ncontinues to provide services at the developmental centers.  If\nthe citizen and/or the parent(s) or guardian(s) believes that the\ncommunity placement or service is not meeting the citizen's needs\nduring this period, then they may request that the State\nDefendants timely provide a choice of alternative placements or\nservices.  The State Defendants will immediately respond to such\na request in accordance with the provisions of Section V.B.ll of\nthis Agreement.  If, at the end of this six-month period, the\ncommunity placement continues to meet the individual needs of the\ncitizen, then the State Defendants will cease holding the\ndevelopmental center bed.  All community placements shall be made\nin accordance with applicable federal law and regulations.

State Defendants will provide adequately trained and\nsupervised direct care staff to meet a 1:4  (day), 1:4  (evening)\nand 1:8  (night) staff-to-client ratio at each developmental\ncenter.  All direct care staff will be trained to recognize and\nreport abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.  This ratio shall be\ncalculated by counting only staff actually on duty at each\ncenter.  Staff engaged in housekeeping or other chores may not be\ncounted to meet the staffing ratio.  Furthermore, staff assigned\nto 1:1 interaction with a particular citizen may not be counted\nin the staffing ratio for the other citizens in the area.\nD.  State Defendants shall design and implement a data\ncollection system for tracking incidents of injury and suspected\nor alleged abuse or neglect statewide.\nE.

State Defendants shall ensure citizens are protected\nfrom abuse, neglect, and preventable injuries, unnecessary\nrestraint and restrictive procedures, and unnecessary medication\nthrough prevention, reporting, investigating and resolution\ntechniques.  Prevention includes elements of staff training and\nsupervision.  Systematic review of information about abuse,\nneglect and injuries shall occur.  The causes of abuse, neglect\nand injuries shall be identified so that the conditions and\npractices contributing to the occurrence of such incidents will\nbe eliminated.\nG.

Toward this end,\nthe Investigations Coordinator shall submit quarterly reports on\nthe activities of the 01 to TBI for at least the first two years\nafter the signing of this Agreement unless otherwise shortened by\n- 48 -\n\nthe parties.  Confidential copies of these quarterly reports\nshall also be provided to counsel for the parties.  The\nInvestigations Coordinator, at his or her discretion, may redact\nfrom the copies sent to the parties any information the release\nof which the Investigations Coordinator believes may compromise\nan ongoing investigation.

Monitoring and Enforcement\nA.  Quality Review Panel\n1.  The Quality Review Panel  (Review Panel or Panel)\nshall be constituted by three individuals mutually agreed upon by\nthe parties with recognized expertise in the field of\ndevelopmental disabilities, transitional and community services.\nTwo members will work part-time.  The third member will Chair the\nPanel and will work full-time in that position for at least the\nfirst two years following the Court's entry of this Agreement.\nFor selection of the members of the Panel, each party may submit\na list of three names with their respective resumes.  The parties\nshall consult on all of the names submitted and agree upon the\nthree members for the Panel.  If the parties are unable to agree,\nthe Court  (Magistrate Judge) shall select a panel of experts from\n- 53 -\n\nthe persons nominated by the parties.  If any of the Panel\nmembers are unable to continue to serve, his or her replacement\nshall be selected in the same manner as described above.\n2.  The purpose of this Panel is to assist in the\nimplementation of this Agreement.  The Panel will have two\nprimary functions:  i) to review placement decisions and\nplanning; and ii) to assist in monitoring the implementation of\nthis Agreement.  It is intended that the Panel will pursue a\nproblem-solving approach so that litigation and disagreements can\nbe minimized and the energies of all interested persons can be\nfocused on the task of meeting the needs of the citizens and\nachieving the outcomes required by this Agreement.  To these\nends, the Review Panel shall develop a set of policies and\nprocedures consistent with this Agreement and professional\nstandards, within 3 0 days of the seating of the Panel, in\nconjunction with the parties and subject to their agreement.\nThese policies and procedures shall be documented in writing and\ndistributed to all parties and the Court  (Magistrate Judge).  The\nReview Panel may modify these policies and procedures, including\nthe methodologies for reviews discussed below, as appropriate to\nmeet the requirements of different stages of the implementation\nof this Agreement.  Any party may recommend such modifications to\nthe Review Panel.  All modifications of these policies and\nprocedures must be made in writing and are subject to the\nparties' agreement.  Any disputes concerning these policies and\nprocedures that cannot be resolved shall be addressed first\n- 54 -\n\nthrough mediation conference with Court/Magistrate Judge with\nnotice to all parties.\n3.  The Panel will operate as follows:\na.  The Panel will meet at least quarterly to\ncarry out its responsibilities as outlined in X.A.2. and shall\nmeet at such other times as it deems appropriate.  The State\nagrees to provide the Review Panel with sufficient resources to\nperform its functions under this Agreement, including resources\nto employ experts and staff.  Within 45 days of the appointment\nof the full Review Panel, the Panel shall submit an annual budget\nto the State for review and approval, and, thereafter, shall\nsubmit a budget on an annual basis two months prior to the\nbeginning of the proposed funding period.  This budget will show\nthe resource needs and costs associated with planned activities\nof the Review Panel for the coming year.  This budget should\nprovide sufficient detail such that proposed amounts for spending\nand resource allocation by area of activity are set out.  These\nplanned activities will be consistent with the responsibilities\nand duties of the Review Panel as described in this Agreement.\nThe State and the Review Panel shall agree on methods for\nclear documentation and accountability regarding Review Panel\nexpenditures including procedures for ensuring that Review Panel\nmembers receive timely compensation from the State.  Review Panel\nmembers shall receive appropriate and timely compensation from\nthe State Defendants and shall be promptly reimbursed by State\nDefendants for services and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses\n- 55 -\n\nincurred in performing their duties.  Reimbursement rates for\nout-of-pocket expenses, including travel, shall be consistent\nwith existing State regulations.  The annual cost of the\nactivities of the Review Panel will not exceed a cap of $550,000\nwithout an approved modification.  In the event that\nunanticipated circumstances give rise to the need for budget\nmodifications during the year, the Review Panel shall submit to\nthe State requests for modifications of its annual budget.\nBudget modifications include substantial changes or increases in\nspending and resource allocations in the existing budget as well\nas expenses that will exceed the annual cap amount.  Total\nrequests for modification shall not exceed 20% of the annual\nbudget amount.  The State also agrees to provide the Panel with\nadditional $50,000 of \"in-kind\" services and support  (copying,\nphones, office materials and space) annually.  If the State and\nthe Review Panel are unable to resolve budget and related issues,\nthey will pursue resolution through mediation conference with the\nCourt  (Magistrate Judge) with notice to all parties.  If the\nReview Panel feels that its ability to perform its duties is\nbeing constrained by the State's actions concerning budget and\nrelated issues, then the Review Panel may seek immediate review\nand relief through the mediation process herein described with\nthe Court  (Magistrate Judge) with notice to all parties.\nb.  The State agrees that the duties of the TQI\nCoordinator at each developmental center shall include assisting\nthe Review Panel in the performance of its functions.  If this\n- 56 -\n\narrangement proves to be insufficient, the State and the Review\nPanel shall determine a mutually agreeable alternative for\nproviding the services of an ombudsperson at each developmental\ncenter.\nc.  Consistent with section V.A.9 of this\nAgreement, the ISTP and Independent Support Coordinator's\nplacement certification for each citizen will be filed with the\nPanel.  The Panel will review each individual placement prior to\nsuch placement occurring.  The Panel shall complete its reviews\nand report to the IDT within twenty  (20) days of receiving the\nISTP and certification from the IDT, unless the Panel requests\nadditional., time for a particular placement.  The Panel's review\nwill include review of relevant supporting documentation and\nissues raised by members of the IDT.  Such reviews shall\ndetermine the adequacy of the placement and ensure that the\nplacement meets the individual needs of each citizen.  Where the\nPanel determines that there are major deficiencies with a\nplacement, the placement shall not occur until all the identified\nmajor deficiencies are corrected.  Any other deficiencies shall\nbe corrected in a timely manner.\nFor the first six months following the seating of the Panel,\nsuch reviews will be conducted by all three members of the Panel,\nbut thereafter such reviews may be conducted only by the Chair,\nconsulting as the Chair deems appropriate with the other members\nof the Panel.  Reviews shall be reduced to writing in any case\nwhere deficiencies are identified and such deficiencies shall be\n- 57 -\n\nspecified with particularity.  State Defendants shall correct\nsuch deficiencies in a timely manner.\nd.  The Panel will assist in monitoring compliance\nwith this Agreement.  System reviews of the quality of all\nservices and supports provided to the citizens in each of the\ndevelopmental centers and in the community shall be conducted by\nthe Panel on an annual basis.  These reviews shall be conducted\nseparately and staggered every six months, with the first review\nof all the institutions occurring within six months of the entry\nof this Agreement and the first review of the community services\nprovided to each citizen occurring six months thereafter.\nWithin two months of the seating of the Review Panel, the\nPanel shall develop, in conjunction with the Parties and subject\nto their agreement, a written, professionally-based, evaluation\nmethodology to be used for their annual system reviews of the\nquality of all services and supports provided to citizens in the\ndevelopmental centers and in the community.  This methodology\nshall include at least the following items:  1) the number and\ntype of experts the Panel anticipates will assist in evaluating\ncompliance; 2) the sampling approach and data collection methods;\n3) the approach and procedures for site visits, site visit\npreparation, and on-site data collection; 4) the anticipated\nnumber of days and types of activities conducted on-site to\nevaluate compliance; 5) the anticipated types of documents that\nwill be reviewed; and 6) methods for measuring and assessing\ncompliance and progress with this Agreement.  The State shall\n- 58 -\n\nhave this methodology for at least four months before the Review\nPanel conducts the initial review of either the institutions or\nthe community.  This methodology is intended to give a framework\nfor the Panel's reviews, but shall in no way operate to amend,\nalter or otherwise displace the requirements of this Agreement.\nThe Review Panel may modify their methodology.  The provisions\nset out above in Section X.A.2. regarding modifications of the\nPanel's policies and procedures shall apply to modifications of\nthe review methodology.\nIn conducting their reviews, the Review Panel shall work\ncooperatively with the State and, to the extent possible, notify\nthe State of their observations and conclusions as reviews take\nplace.  The Review Panel shall submit to the parties and to the\nCourt a written report for each review that details their\nmethodology, findings and recommendations.  The focus of these\nreports shall be on compliance with this Agreement, but the\nreports shall also contain appraisals of the progress made by\nState Defendants during the review period.  The State shall\nensure that all deficiencies are remedied promptly.  The parties\nmay wish to discuss these reports within the context of the\nprovisions of scheduled quarterly status conferences with the\nCourt.  If disputes arise as to the scope, findings, or\nrecommendations of these reports, the parties shall make every\neffort to resolve these informally.  Any disputes that cannot be\nresolved shall be addressed through the processes described in\nsection B.I. of this section, below.\n- 59 -\n\ne.  There shall be no ex parte communications between\nthe Review Panel and the Court.  Ex parte communications among\nthe Review Panel and the parties are permitted.\nf.  In the event that the State has concerns about\nwhether the activities of the Review Panel are unreasonable or\ninconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and is unable to\nresolve these concerns informally with the Review Panel, the\nState shall seek to address these concerns through mediation\nconference with the Court/Magistrate Judge with notice to all\nparties.\nB.  Reporting and Enforcement\n1.  If any party believes that State Defendants are\nfailing to comply with this Agreement, or with any part thereof,\nthe party must confer with State Defendants in a good faith\neffort to attempt to reach an agreement regarding corrections of\nany of the alleged deficiencies prior to bringing an enforcement\naction.  If the parties are unable to agree, any party shall\nrequest a mediation conference with the Magistrate Judge assigned\nto this case.  This requirement is subject, however, to the\nfollowing emergency exception.  Any party may bring an action for\nimmediate injunctive relief if the party believes that there\nexists an imminent or continuing risk of serious harm to any\ncitizen that is not being addressed appropriately by State\nDefendants.\n2.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a party\nfrom ultimately seeking redress with the Court in the event that\n- 60 -\n\nefforts at conciliation and mediation are unsuccessful.  If\nmediation or further injunctive relief prove unsuccessful, a\nparty may seek additional relief from the Court.\n3.  The parties shall hold quarterly status conferences\nwith the Magistrate Judge assigned to this case to review State\nDefendants' compliance with the Schedule of Implementation,\nincorporated as Attachment A to this Agreement.\n4.  State Defendants shall provide to the parties and\nthe Panel copies of the TQI internal and external peer review\nreports, and any annual surveys, including the surveys of the\ncommunity-based programs and facilities referenced in V.D.I.\nState Defendants shall provide to the parties and the Panel on a\nmonthly basis:  primary documentation regarding deaths  (including\ndeath certificates, death summaries, discharge papers,\ninvestigative reports, and preliminary and completed autopsies);\nstatistical summaries of incidents and injuries; relevant summary\ninformation on hospitalizations and code blues; summaries of\nrestraint usage; completed abuse and neglect investigation\nreports and documentation of any disciplinary or follow-up\nactions taken.  State Defendants shall immediately notify the\nparties and the Panel of any deaths or allegations of serious\nabuse or neglect involving serious injuries or incidents.\n5.  The Panel, the parties to this Agreement and their\nattorneys, consultants and agents shall have reasonable access to\nall information, records, buildings and areas, including those of\nproviders, and shall be permitted to interview any citizen,\n- 61 -\n\nemployee of State Defendants or of any provider, at reasonable\ntimes and places.  The Panel and the parties are not required to\ngive State Defendants advance notice of their intent to visit any\nfacility.  State Defendants may seek relief from the Court in the\nevent that State Defendants believe the Panel or any party's\nmonitoring activities are unreasonable or inconsistent with this\nSettlement Agreement.\n6.  State Defendants shall bear all costs related to\ncopying or otherwise supplying the parties or the Review Panel\nwith documents requested by the parties or the Panel that relate\nto the State Defendants' compliance with this Agreement.  The\nidentities-of citizens shall be kept confidential, and neither\nthe names nor likenesses of citizens shall be publicized without\ntheir permission except that the parties may refer to a citizen\nby the citizen's first name and last initial.\n7.  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude any party\nfrom conducting additional discovery pursuant to the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, such as, but not limited to,\ndepositions or requests for admissions, on matters relating to\nenforcement or compliance with the Agreement.  State Defendants\nmay seek relief from the Court in the event that State Defendants\nbelieve a party's discovery activities are unreasonable or\ninconsistent with this Settlement Agreement.\n8.  Retaliation against any individual, employee,\nfamily member or citizen based on communication with the Panel or\nany party or party representative is strictly prohibited.  A\n- 62 -\n\nnotice to this effect must be posted in all locations where\ncitizens live and employee and public notices are posted.  The\nfalsification of records, data, correspondence or other\ninformation required for determining the State Defendants'\ncompliance with this Agreement is strictly prohibited and will be\na violation of this Agreement, subjecting State Defendants to\ncontempt sanctions by the Court.  A notice to this effect will be\nposted in all locations where employee and public notices are\nposted.\n9.  At least for the first three years following the\nsigning of this Agreement, the Tennessee Comptroller's Office\nshall conduct or shall contract for two annual audits.  The first\naudit will focus on the regional centers and will consist of two\nparts:  an audit of citizen monies and personal property; and an\naudit of the operation of the centers.  The second audit will\nconsist of the same two parts, but will be focused on the\ncommunity placements, including the services and supports.  The\nresults of the two annual audits shall be provided to the Court,\nand the parties.\n10.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction of this action\nfor all purposes under this Agreement until this action is\ndismissed.\n11.  Any party to this Agreement may move to modify,\namend or alter this Agreement at any time after entry of the\nOrder adopting this Agreement.\n- 63 -\n\n12.  After this Agreement has been in effect for at\nleast three years, the State Defendants may petition this Court\nfor termination of this Agreement on grounds that they have\nachieved and demonstrated their ability to maintain compliance\nwith its provisions.  Upon filing of such a petition, the parties\nshall have 90 days within which they may tour and respond.  If no\nresponse is forthcoming, or if the parties agree, then the\nAgreement shall terminate.  If any party does respond, the Review\nPanel thereafter will conduct a review of the compliance issues\nraised by the petition and response(s), and report to the Court\nand the parties on the results of that review.  The Court will\nconduct a hearing as soon as practicable thereafter.  The State\nDefendants will bear the burden of showing that they have\nachieved and demonstrated their ability to maintain compliance\nwith this Agreement.\nAfter this Agreement has been in effect for at least two\nyears, the State Defendants may petition this Court for\ntermination of this Agreement in part.  Such petition for partial\ntermination shall be available only for demonstrating the\nachievement and maintenance of compliance with all of the\nprovisions of Sections VI., Institutional Care and Services, and\nVII, Protection from Harm, with respect to institutional\nconditions at one or more of the three developmental centers\ncovered by this Agreement.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney General  Washington. D.C.  20035\nMarch  1,  1996\nU.S. v. Tennessee\nThe  Honorable  Don  Sundquist  ||||||||||  Mill ill II II II  II Illl Illllll  II  II II\nGovernor\nS t a te  of T e n n e s s ee  Mill  III I  Illllll IIII  II II II Illl Illlllll  II  Illl\nState Capitol  MR-TN-004-007\nNashville, Tennessee  37219\nRe:  Harold Jordan Habilitation Center\nDear Governor Sundquist:\nOn June 23, 1994, we advised Governor McWherter of this\nDepartment's intent to investigate conditions at the Clover\nBottom Developmental Center  (Clover Bottom) in Nashville,\nTennessee, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPersons Act  (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  On March 10, 1995, we\nadvised you of our investigative findings at Clover Bottom and\nfurther advised you that we had not yet concluded our\ninvestigation of the Harold Jordan Habilitation Center  (Jordan\nCenter), which is a program of Clover Bottom.  In May 1995, we\nconducted an expert tour of the Jordan Center.  Following our\ntour, we conveyed our initial findings to the facility\nsuperintendent and other State officials.\nAs set forth in our recent findings letters to you regarding\nClover Bottom and other Tennessee Developmental Centers, under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and relevant federal statutes, residents\nof state-operated facilities for the developmentally disabled and\nmentally retarded have a right to, inter alia, adequate medical\ncare, reasonably safe conditions, and training sufficient to\nprotect each resident's liberty interests, including training to\npermit each resident an opportunity to function as independently\nas possible.  Programs must be provided to teach adaptive skills,\nincluding self-help, communication, and social skills.  In\naddition, individuals with developmental disabilities must be\nprovided services in community-based programs where appropriate.\nOur investigation of the Jordan Center identified a number of\nviolations of the constitutional and federal statutory\nrights of Jordan Center residents that are similar to the\nviolations we identified earlier with respect to Clover Bottom\n\n- 2 -\nresidents.1/  Our review also indicates that the rights of\nthe residents guaranteed by Tennessee state law are also being\nviolated.  See, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. § 33-3-104 and § 33-5-201.\nViolations of these statutes deprive residents of their\nprocedural due process rights.\nThe general facts that support our findings of\nunconstitutional conditions and violations of federal law at the\nJordan Center, as well as the necessary remedial measures to\ncorrect these conditions and violations, are similar to the\nfindings and remedies that we articulated in our March 10, 1995\nClover Bottom findings letter.  As such, we set forth our\nspecific findings and remedies with regard to the Jordan Center\nin summary fashion below.\nI.  Inadequate Staffing And Protection From Harm At The Harold\nJordan Habilitation Center.\nThe Harold Jordan Habilitation Center is a facility serving\napproximately 34 residents who have a dual diagnosis of both\nmental retardation and mental illness.  The majority of Jordan\nCenter's residents come to the facility either through the State\ncriminal courts because they have been determined to be\nincompetent to stand trial, or they arrive from another State\nmental retardation facility because the other facility has\nconcluded that their behaviors present a danger to themselves or\nother residents.  Thus, Jordan Center residents require intensive\npsychological and psychiatric therapies.  This level of therapy,\nhowever, is simply not provided at the Jordan Center.\n1/  See, e.g., Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12132, et sea, (and implementing\nregulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(1), and 28 C.F.R. 35.130(d));\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794;\nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, e_t sea.\n(and implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.420 - 480);\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§\n1400, e_t seq.  (and implementing regulations) ; Youngberg v. Romeo,\n457 U.S. 307  (1982); United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-2062,\nslip op.  (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 17, 1994) ; Halderman v. Pennhurst State\nSchool & Hospital, 154 F.R.D. 594  (E.D. Pa. 1994); Jackson v.\nFort Stanton Hosp. & Training School, 757 F. Supp. 1243  (D. N.M.\n1990), rev'd in part on other grounds, 964 F.2d 980  (10th Cir.\n1992); Thomas S. bv Brooks v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178  (W.D.\nN.C. 1988), aff'd 902 F.2d 250  (4th Cir.), cert, denied, 498 U.S.\n951  (1990); Clark v. Cohen. 613 F. Supp. 684  (E.D. Pa. 1985),\naff'd, 794 F.2d 79  (3d Cir. 1986) cert, denied. 479 U.S. 962\n(1986) ; Gary W. v. Louisiana. 437 F. Supp. 1209  (E.D. La. 1976) .\n\n- 3 -\nMany of the deficiencies outlined below can be traced\ndirectly to the Jordan Center's lack of a sufficient number of\nadequately trained professional and direct care staff.  These\nstaffing and treatment deficiencies are placing Jordan Center\nresidents at undue and unreasonable risk of harm and are\nresulting in injuries.\nII.  Treatment Programs Do Not Address The Needs Of Residents.\nTreatment plans and programs developed by the Jordan Center\nstaff do not address the specific treatment needs of residents.\nJordan Center residents require programs that are either specific\nto their alleged crimes  (e.g., arson, sexual battery) or specific\nto their behavior-related difficulties.  Neither is in evidence\nat the Jordan Center.  The Jordan Center training programs are\nvery generic and global, and fail to address the reasons why\nresidents are confined to the Jordan Center.\nFurther, it appears that some Jordan Center residents are\nconfined to the facility for unjustifiably long periods.  For\nexample, a number of Jordan Center residents are placed at the\nfacility by the criminal courts following findings that these\nindividuals are incompetent to stand trial, either because of\ntheir mental illness, mental retardation, or a combination of\nboth.  We were informed by Jordan Center staff, however, that\ncertain residents who are currently committed to the facility\nbecause they were found to be incompetent to stand trial are\nlikely never to gain competency due to the severity of their\ndisabilities.  Such prolonged and indeterminate confinement based\nupon incompetency to stand trial implicates due process rights\nbecause the nature and duration of commitment must bear some\nrelation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\nJackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715  (1972).  The commitment status\nof all residents should, therefore, be reviewed for legal\nsufficiency.  Where, as here, treatment is grossly deficient,\nconfinement of these individuals in these circumstances raises\nserious constitutional issues.\nA.  Psychological Services Are Inadequate.\nDespite the need of Jordan Center residents for intensive\npsychological services, there is no doctorate-level or similarly\nqualified psychologist working at the Center.  The current\npsychology staff is simply not equipped, by education and\ntraining, to address the needs of residents with severe behavior\ndisorders or criminal behaviors.\nCurrent psychology staff have no forensic training, no\nknowledge of functional analysis, and no knowledge of the\ninteractions of medication or environmental factors upon resident\nbehavior.  Without sufficient expertise among Jordan Center\n\n- 4 -\npsychology staff, the needs of residents go unmet.  Further, a\nreliable data collection system is not in place upon which Jordan\nCenter professionals can appropriately base treatment decisions.\nB.  Psychiatric Services Are Inadequate.\nAgain, despite the fact that Jordan Center residents require\nintensive psychiatric care, the psychiatric care that is provided\nresidents is cursory at best.  Jordan Center staff freely admit\nthat the amount of psychiatric coverage is inadequate to meet the\nneeds of residents.  The current psychiatrist servicing the\nJordan Center provides no psychotherapy to residents, nor does\nshe maintain a regular schedule that allows her sufficient\non-site time for resident contact.  The absence of adequate\npsychiatric services has a direct and detrimental effect on the\nmental health, and, ultimately, the physical health and safety of\nthe residents.\nIll.  Individuals With Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA).\nThe Jordan Center is not providing its school-aged residents\nwith an appropriate education in accordance with the requirements\nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA), 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1400-1486.  The IDEA requires that the Jordan Center\nprovide adequate individualized education plans, along with\nsufficient \"related services\" designed to meet the needs of all\nschool-aged residents.  Moreover, education must be provided in\nthe \"least restrictive educational environment.\"  The Jordan\nCenter does not have a sufficient number of qualified special\neducation teachers to provide a special education teacher in each\nclassroom and does not provide adequate supportive therapies,\nsuch as appropriate psychological services.  In addition, because\nthe Jordan Center is a totally self-contained program, there is\nno opportunity for any of the school-aged children to access\neducational services in a less-restrictive environment.  As we\nfound with regard to Clover Bottom, the Jordan Center must\nenhance its educational and related services and provide for\nappropriate placement and\" services in the local public school\nsystems, where appropriate.\nIV.  Jordan Center's Institutional Environment Fails To Meet The\nNeeds Of Residents.\nIn providing care and services to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, it is essential to furnish them with\nan acceptable and responsive environment that ensures safety and\npromotes learning, development, and their overall well-being.\nSuch environments must be functional and serve to enhance the\nquality of life for the individuals.  Currently accepted\nprofessional standards require that this environment be the least\nseparate, most integrated setting where the individual's needs\ncan be met.  It must be safe, stable, and operate to teach and\n\n- 5 -\nmaintain functional skills, to reduce or preempt the occurrence\nof behavior problems, and otherwise promote the independent\nfunctioning of the individual.  The Jordan Center does not meet\nthese requirements.  The State's practice of transferring\nindividuals with the most challenging behaviors from other\ndevelopmental centers and congregating them at the Jordan Center\nis inimical to currently accepted professional standards that\nthese individuals should be served in appropriate settings that\nare specifically tailored to address their unique needs.\nV.  Remedial Measures.\nAs the findings set forth above are substantially similar to\nmany of those contained in our March 10, 1995, findings letter to\nyou concerning Clover Bottom, the same remedial measures relevant\nto. these findings set forth in that letter are applicable to the\nJordan Center and those remedies are incorporated herein by\nreference.  Please refer to the Clover Bottom findings letter for\na thorough detailing of the required remedial measures.\nAs a further measure, the State must develop a new model to\nserve the needs of individuals with particularly challenging\nbehaviors, rather than merely transferring them to the Jordan\nCenter.  The State must also ensure that residents committed to\nthe Jordan Center following court proceedings are not confined to\nthe Jordan Center for any longer than is legally justified, based\nupon the original grounds for that commitment.\nSinperely-y-\nDeval L.

      "text": "U.S. v. Tennessee\n••  ••  •  •  ••  ••  •  •  ••  ••  ••  I •  ••\nT. 6/12/95  MR-TN-004-005\nAEP:RB:LW:VH:LJ:JY:cmw\nDJ 168-71-10\nPlacement of Undercover Employee at the\nClover Bottom Developmental Center, a\nFacility for Developmentally Disabled,\nin Nashville, Tennessee\nRichard W. Roberts  Arthur E. Peabody, Jr.\nChief  Chief\nCriminal Section  Special Litigation Section\nWe recently met with Al Moskowitz and Tom Perez to discuss\nour involvement with four centers for developmentally disabled\nindividuals run by the state of Tennessee.  Evidence at several\nof the centers indicates that there has been a pattern of abuse\nand neglect of residents there, including some criminal activity.\nWe have utilized this evidence in our civil action and\ninvestigations, but as we outlined in our meeting, the nature of\nthe centers, including rigid management control over employees,\nthe inter-relationship of the employees, poor or fraudulent  '\ndocumentation, and the mental disabilities of the individual\nresidents suffering the abuse, has limited our ability to uncover\nsome of the more egregious abuse we believe to be occurring.\nYears ago, placement of undercover employees in these types\nof situations proved fruitful.  We believe that this type of\noperation would be useful here, and would be a good place to\nreinvigorate our cooperation with the Criminal Section in\ninvestigating institutions.  We recommend that our offices\ncoordinate with the Office of the United States Attorney and the\nFBI in Nashville to place an individual undercover at the Clover\nBottom Developmental Center  (\"CBDC\") in Nashville.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOur investigations of institutions for developmentally\ndisabled citizens in Tennessee began with the Arlington\nDevelopmental Center  (\"ADC\") located outside of Memphis.\nFollowing a lengthy trial in 1993, the district court issued a\nstinging rebuke of the facility and its administrators, and a\ndetailed remedial order is now in place.  Although we believe\nthat physical abuse  (as well as theft of resident property and\ndrug dealing) may be continuing at the ADC, the facility is now\nunder court order, is reviewed by a court monitor pursuant to the\norder, has hired three investigators and is being investigated by\nthe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation  (\"TBI\").  The local\ndistrict attorney's office has indicted at least three ADC\ncc:  Records Chrono Peabody Bowman Weinstein Hughes>yackson Yost Hold\n\n- 2 -\nemployees for the murder of a resident, and five employees for\nmisdemeanor assaults of residents.\nWith such involvement by local authorities at this facility,\nan undercover operation may be directed best at one of the other\nfacilities, which our investigations indicate evidence similar\npatterns of abuse, management cover-up and petty criminal\nactivity.  Of the three other Tennessee centers for\ndevelopmentally disabled individuals under investigation, we\nrecommend that an undercover person be placed at CBDC, because it\nis the largest of the three other centers, has a reputation over\nmany years as being worse than ADC, and continues to generate a\nnumber of allegations of serious abuse.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 1990, at the request to the United States Attorney in\nMemphis, we began investigating conditions at the Arlington\nDevelopmental Center  (\"ADC\"), in Arlington, Tennessee.\nApproximately 450 developmentally disabled children and adults\nresided at the facility.  After several tours of the facility by\nour experts and many months of unsuccessful negotiations, we sued\nADC for violating the federal statutory and constitutional rights\nof the citizens residing there.  Allegations of verbal and\nphysical abuse, as well as evidence of unexplained injuries and\nsham investigations, formed part of the case against the facility\nand its administrators.  However, because of the limited ability\nof most of the residents to communicate, the tight control of ADC\nmanagement over employees, the extensive familial ties among\nemployees on the units, and poor or falsified documentation, we\nhad difficulty obtaining specific information on individual\nincidents  (e.g., who did this to the resident, on what day, and\nwitnessed by whom?).\nAfter five weeks of trial, on November 22, 1993, the\ndistrict court found the facility had failed to provide even\nminimal care to the residents, ruling in our favor on each count.\nThe opinion and findings of fact are attached.  The court found\nthat, inter alia, \"[j]ob security of employees is consistently\nplaced above the constitutional rights\" of residents, employees\nwere intimidated against reporting problems, and administrators\nperformed no meaningful investigations of possible resident\nabuse.  The court issued a preliminary injunction, and,\nsubsequently, a remedial order.  These orders gave specific\ndirectives regarding improving conditions at ADC.  In addition,\nthe court granted our motion to find the State in contempt of the\npreliminary injunction, and another contempt motion filed by us\ndemonstrating the State's noncompliance with the remedial order\nis outstanding.\nWithin the last six months, the ADC investigators, who were\nhired by ADC pursuant to the requirements of the remedial order,\n\n- 3 -\nhave investigated a recent murder and several potential beatings.\nThese matters have been turned over to TBI and the district\nattorney's office for prosecution.\nThroughout our involvement at ADC, we have been told by\npeople knowledgeable of conditions at the various centers in\nTennessee that ADC is not the worst of the four centers in the\nstate, and that CBDC has had a long history of resident abuse and\nmistreatment.  In June 1994, we. formally notified the Governor of\nour intent to investigate CBDC, Greene Valley Developmental\nCenter in Greeneville, and Nat Winston Developmental Center in\nBolivar.  Based upon tours of each facility with experts from\nvarious fields, we found that these centers did indeed have as\nmany, if not more, problems than ADC.  We informed the Governor\nand other state officials of our findings in letters which are\nattached.\nCLOVER BOTTOM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER\nCBDC is a residential facility with over 500 developmentally\ndisabled children and adults.  The Jordan Center, which is\nostensibly a residential forensic facility for developmentally\ndisabled adults, but which also operates as a dumping ground for\nindividuals with behavior disorders from the other centers, is\naffiliated with CBDC.  It houses approximately 34 individuals.\nIn general, the facility is grossly understaffed.  Many of\nthe residents have lived in barren conditions with little\nstimulation for years.  As a result of this and, in some cases,\nmental illness, a number of residents have behavior problems.\nFor example, residents may be self-abusive, bite themselves or\nother residents, eat inedible objects or fight with other\nresidents or staff.  These behaviors sometimes result in\ninjuries.  Unfortunately, in an institution staffed by untrained\nand overworked direct care workers, these behaviors provide both\nthe reason and cover for physical abuse.  That is, staff\nsometimes resort to beatings and other inappropriate punishment\nto \"control\" the residents.  In order to cover up this abuse, or\nother abuse committed without any provocation, staff blame the\nresident or other residents for the injuries they received.\nListed below are some examples of abuse or suspected abuse\nthat have been discovered at CBDC over the last few years.1\nThese examples have been gleaned from documents provided to us\nrecently by CBDC, the Tennessee Protection and Advocacy Agency,\nand TBI.  This list does not include the dozens of examples of\nunexplained fractures and lacerations that are a weekly\noccurrence at CBDC.  Although a number of the examples below are\n1  In addition, as at ADC, there is some indication that\nresident moneys and property are stolen by staff.\n\n- 4 -\nold, the list evidences an extraordinary amount of serious abuse\nand a continuing pattern of CBDC investigators or administrators\noften deflecting blame from the potential abusers to those\nemployees who report the abuse.  Moreover, our experience at ADC\nand other institutions indicates that documented cases of abuse\nrepresent only a very small portion of the actual number of abuse\ncases taking place.\n5/23/95 Developmental technician  (DT) Reginald Blakey indicted\nfor assaulting 29-year-old male resident.\n2/21/95 CBDC reports to TBI that resident may have been beaten\nwith a belt by employee.  Discovered at 6am.  Further detailed\nreport from TBI forthcoming.\n1994 - 1995 Allegations by staff that Superintendent at Jordan\nCenter is using aversive behavior modification techniques in\nviolation of professional practice and state procedures, and has\ntold staff to keep it quiet and not to document this.  Anonymous\nsource provided audio tape of meeting wherein Superintendent\nmakes these statements.\n7/20/94 Ray Bauker alleges he was sprayed in face with a\ndisinfectant by DT Patricia Chatman.  He suffers chemical burns\non face and eyes, and is taken to the emergency room. DT denies\nthis, saying that he smeared feces on his own face.  Chatman is\nterminated, though there is no information as to her appeal or\nwhether she was reinstated.  Examining physician confirms that it\nwas a chemical burn.\n7/94  Protection and Advocacy interviews employee(s) who describe\nthe following ongoing abuse:  DT gave lit cigarette to resident\nand said \"watch, he'll eat it\" and the resident did; DTs forcing\nresidents to stay in urine-soaked clothes; DTs shoving residents\nhard enough to make them fall; forcing them to \"sit down and shut\nup\"; taking away meals to discipline resident for talking; DTs\nwatched as resident tore up his shirt and ate it.\n6/22/94 Tina Mason found with welts resembling shoe tread marks\non her buttocks. TBI is investigating.\n6/14/94 DT Andrew Henry accused by DT Sheeron Davis of kicking\nRoy Atwell in his genitals, leaving Hunter Armstrong, Jerry Luck\nand Gary King on commodes for hours at a time, pushing Mr.\nArmstrong down, and throwing keys at another resident.  CBDC\nreport recommends taking no action against Henry, because Davis,\nthe employee reporting the abuse, is new and has not gone through\ntraining!  [This represents the same pattern we discovered\nrepeatedly at ADC:  abuse only gets reported if a new employee,\nwho has not been indoctrinated into the code of silence, observes\nit, and then the abuser is not punished, but the new employee is\n\n- 5 -\nreprimanded in some fashion or fired if they are still only\nprobationary employees.  See similar cases below.]\n5/20/94 Harold McGovern struck in the face with towel, resulting\nin red welts.  DT Walter Flowers, a new probationary employee, is\nsuspected and recommended for termination.\n5/19/94 DT Donna West reports that on 4/10/94 she observed DT\nBelinda Shelby strike Rose Ann •Toombs with a can of hair spray,\ncausing a laceration to Ms. Toomb's head.  No discipline of\nShelby, but recommended that West be suspended for a day for\nfailure to report incident in timely manner.\n5/14/94 Abuse of Robert Morris:  verbally abused, thrown on bed\nand slapped by DT LaRose; observed by new DT; attempt at cover-up\nby LaRose and Mr. Simmons; papers suggest LaRose was terminated,\nbut later Department of Social Services claims they could not\nsubstantiate the abuse.  Final disposition is unknown.\nMark Downey punched in stomach by DT David Bridges on 5/13/94.\nDT terminated.\nBooker T. Washington abused repeatedly  (e.g., shoved, beaten,\nstomped on) at various times in 1992 and 1993, by DT Ronald\nAustin.  Two other DTs report separate instances, but CBDC\nconcludes they have a personality conflict with Austin and were\nonly trying to retaliate against him.  CBDC does not discipline\nAustin, but recommends written reprimands for the two DTs who\nreported the abuse.\n12/8/93 Cindy Somerville found with bruises on inner buttocks and\nwhite heavy discharge from her vagina.  Sexual abuse is\nsuspected.  Medical check at hospital is inconclusive.  Male DT\nObohanson alleged to have been on unit prior to the discovery\nthat day with another male DT, who was not assigned to the unit.\nNo disciplinary action taken.  Investigator only recommends that\nDTs Obohanson and Ms. Pamela Hobert, who were on duty on the\nunit, receive additional training on communication and bathing\nresidents.  Mother, Kathy Somerville, claims physical and sexual\nabuse to daughter Cindy.  Reported Nashville Banner 7/13/94.\nProtection and Advocacy investigated  (see their report).\n11/27/93  Valecia Day found with bruises on vulva and vaginal\ntear requiring sutures.  Sexual abuse suspected, but CBDC\ninvestigation concludes that injuries were caused by her being\ndropped during bath time.  Female DT received reprimand for\nimproper bathing techniques.\n10/19/93 Frances Walker claims bruises on arms resulted from DT\nTuesday Sanders hitting her.  Sanders is interim employee and is\nallowed to resign.\n\n- 6 -\n9/16/93  DT Sonya Hawkins reports that DT Dawn Dodd told her that\nDT Sabrina Barr pulls Anthony Richards around by the nose and\nsprayed water in his face, making him gag.  No disciplinary\naction taken.\n4/6/93 Danny Bryan reports that DT Duane Custard had anal sex\nwith him.  Custard admits to this and sex with another resident,\nJames Jaco.  He is allowed to resign.\n2/24/93 New employee, James King, reports continuing abuse\nagainst residents in unit, and states he observed the following:\nDT Lee Petty threw and kicked John Mason into wall causing\nlaceration on his head; Petty threw lit cigarettes at Mr. Mason\nwho ate them; Petty hit Robert Weaver with hairbrush; Petty sat\non Leslie Potter's chest and hit him 5 or 6 times in jaw with his\nfist; Petty and DT Hilliard force David Romaine to sit for 2 to 3\nhours on commode so they don't have to clean him.  Petty allowed\nto resign.  No information regarding whether DT Hilliard was\ndisciplined.\nRape of James Barrett on 1/15/93 by DT Joe Jordan:  DT caught\nstanding or bending over naked resident who was on his stomach on\nthe bed.  DT's pants were down and he had erection.  DT fired and\ncriminal charges brought; plead to \"sweetheart deal\" according to\nTBI.\nCrawthon Bowen found on 1/27/93 with red welts on buttocks and\nbruising on hips; blamed on new probationary employee, Wayne\nStevens, and given his prior history of poor performance, he was\nterminated.\n1/6/93 Ralph Bobbit whipped in face with a coat hanger, perhaps\nby Doris Dobson.  Facility believes it might have been self-\ninflicted, but TBI determines that it was not.  No disciplinary\naction taken.\n1/24/93  Ricky McKinnon communicates that DT David Briggs had sex\nwith him.  CBDC concludes there is no evidence, and no action is\ntaken.\n1/18/93 Paul Greer discovered with fractured arm.  DT reports she\nobserved DT Festus Obasohan handling Greer and other resident\nroughly, but Obasohan says fracture occurred after Greer fell off\nthe toilet.  No disciplinary action taken.\n1/10/93 Alonzio Blake tied to a chair by DT Tracey Wilson.  One\nday suspension of Wilson is recommended by CBDC.\n2/28/93 DT Bill Foster slapped and shook Hunter Armstrong.\nWitnessed by Dr. Hensley.  No information on discipline.\n\n- 7 -\n2/10/93 Kay Knight reports seeing another resident, Rosie Cannon,\nbe struck by DT Alisha Thorpe in mouth, cutting lip.\nCONCLUSION\nWe propose that we meet with relevant members of your\nsection, as well as attorneys from the Office of the United\nStates Attorney in Nashville to discuss our proposal as soon as\npossible.\nAlthough your Section, the Nashville United States Attorney,\nand the FBI will know better how to position an undercover\nperson, and more can be discussed on this point later, a few\npreliminary observations are in order.  First, based upon our\nknowledge of the administrators, we believe it would be most\nadvantageous to place an individual at the facility without their\nknowledge, if at all possible.  Second, most of the cases of\nabuse or suspected abuse emanate from the units where residents\nwith behavior problems reside.  Thus, it would be ideal to get\nthe undercover person assigned to one of these areas.  The best\nway to assure that that happens is to utilize a large male as the\nundercover operative.  Large males are typically assigned to\nthese units to help \"control\" the residents.  It would also be\nuseful to provide him with a work background as a direct care\nworker for developmentally disabled individuals with behavior\nproblems.\nAttachments",

Tennessee\nThe  Honorable  Don  Sundquist  \"HUM  INI II II II III Ml Mill II  ||||  ||\nGovernor  MR-TN-004-003\nState of Tennessee\nState Capitol\nNashville, Tennessee  37219\nRe:  Clover Bottom Developmental Center\nDear Governor Sundquist:\nOn June 23, 1994, we advised Governor McWherter of this\nDepartment's intent to investigate conditions at the Clover\nBottom Developmental Center (\"CBDC\") in Nashville, Tennessee,\npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\n(\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  During the weeks of September 26,\nOctober 3, and October 10, 1994, we toured the facility\naccompanied by consultants in the fields of medicine, psychology,\npsychiatry, nursing and physical therapy.  We want to thank the\nCBDC staff and the representatives from the Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation and the Attorney General's office\nfor their cooperation during this investigation.  Following each\nof our tours, we conveyed to the facility superintendent and\nother state officials an initial assessment of deficiencies at\nthe facility.  Although we have not yet finished our assessment\nof the Harold Jordan Center, we have completed our findings with\nregard to CBDC itself.\nWe regret to advise you that we found numerous conditions at\nCBDC that violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights\nof the residents there.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment and\nrelevant federal statutes, residents of state-operated facilities\nfor the developmentally disabled and mentally retarded have a\nright to, inter alia, adequate medical care, reasonably safe\nconditions, and training sufficient to protect each resident's\nliberty interests, including training to permit each resident an\nopportunity to function as independently as possible.  Programs\nmust be provided to teach adaptive skills, including self-help,\ncommunication, and social skills.  In addition, individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities must be provided services in\n\n- 2 -\ncommunity-based programs where appropriate. 1/  CBDC is not in\ncompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the substantive provisions of Title XIX\nof the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq.. and the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§\n1400, e£ seq.  Our review also indicates that the rights of the\nresidents guaranteed by Tennessee state law are also being\nviolated.  See, e.g.. Tenn. Code Ann. § 33-3-104 and § 33-5-201.\nThe general facts that support our findings of\nunconstitutional conditions and violations of federal statutory\nrights at CBDC are set forth below.\nI.  CBDC Residents Are Not Adequately Protected From Harm or\nSerious Risk of Harm Due to the Lack of Supervision and\nProgramming.\nThe most serious and pervasive health risk to the residents\nof CBDC is that of injury.  Fractures, lacerations, and soft\ntissue injuries are documented repeatedly in the records and were\nobvious to our experts as they toured the living units.  The lack\nof adequate direct care staff, the almost total lack of unit\nactivities or stimulation of any kind, and the inability of staff\nto manage maladaptive or aggressive behaviors, were apparent\nthroughout the tours and undoubtedly contribute to the high rate\nof injuries suffered at CBDC.  Residents with sensory impairment\nare even further isolated by the lack of attention to their\nneeds.  Furthermore, CBDC's investigation and analysis of\ninjuries is not calculated to reduce or eliminate injuries or\nabuse of residents by staff.\ni/  See, e.g.. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12132, et seq.  (and implementing\nregulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(1), and 28 C.F.R. 35.130(d));\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794;\nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et sea.\n(and implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.420 - 480);\nYoungberg v.

Injuries\nMany of the injuries suffered by CBDC residents may be\nrelated to the dearth of appropriately trained and supervised\ndirect care staff.  Document review and observations confirmed\nthat CBDC residents suffer from the chronic under-staffing at the\nfacility.  Furthermore, it became apparent that many staff did\nnot have, or were not being required to utilize, the necessary\nskills to serve developmentally disabled persons.  Many injuries\noccurred, as reported in incident reports, in which the staff\nperson's description of the event indicated that sufficient time\nexisted for staff intervention, but such intervention did not\noccur.  For example, one resident hit another two separate times\nand after the second assault, the attacked resident retaliated by\nbiting the first resident all over his chest.  While this course\nof events was recorded, it was not interrupted.\nCBDCs insufficient staffing results in staff not familiar\nwith residents often working in units other than where actually\nassigned.  Many staff interviewed during our tours were unable to\nidentify the individuals for whom they were providing care and\nother staff freely admitted that they were not working in a unit\nwhere they usually worked.  Lack of familiarity with the\nindividuals living in various units creates difficulties for even\nthe best-intentioned staff, who may be unaware of significant\nissues in their temporarily assigned unit.\nWhile many of the incident reports described injuries that\nwere obviously observed by staff, many other injuries were found\nonly after they had occurred.  Such unobserved injuries include\nserious lacerations, bruises and sprains.\nFurthermore, the incident reporting system that CBDC uses\ndoes not allow for the kind of analysis that would enable the\nfacility to prevent re-occurrence of avoidable injuries.  For\ninstance, in one eight month period, one resident received\nlacerations serious enough to require stitches on seven separate\noccasions.  For five of those incidents, the injury was described\nas the result of another resident, unidentified in each instance,\npushing or hitting the injured resident.  One laceration was of\nunknown origin and the last was reported to be self-inflicted,\napparently by accident.  Without more information in the reports,\nit is impossible to tell whether or not the same resident was\nresponsible for the five assaults.  That information is\nsignificant for CBDC to analyze in order to prevent future\naltercations.\nIn another instance, the incident reports reveal that in one\nseven month period, a resident received injuries on twenty-six\noccasions.  Many of those injuries were reported to have occurred\nduring fights with other residents, one-third were reported as\nself-inflicted, several were found on the resident  (of unknown\n\n- 4 -\ncause) and one was caused when the resident was being restrained.\nHalf of the injuries were serious enough to require stitches and\nin one instance the resident lost two teeth.  Significantly,\nseveral of the incident reports noted the re-opening of earlier\nwounds that were not represented in earlier incident reports.\nTherefore, the injury reports summarized here under-represent the\ntrue extent of the injuries suffered by this resident.  This\ninaccurate recording extends beyond just this one individual.\nDuring our tours, we observed many other residents with injuries\nfor whom no incident report describing that injury could be\nfound.  We, therefore, conclude that the documentation of\ninjuries, as the documentation in all other areas, was not\ncomplete and that the injuries described in CBDC incident reports\ndo not represent the totality of injuries actually experienced by\nCBDC residents.\nThe examples of injuries described above are not isolated,\nexceptional circumstances, nor the most egregious.  Our review of\ninjury documentation and our observations during the tours reveal\nthat CBDC residents suffer injuries and assaults on a regular\nbasis and are at serious risk of harm in their own living units\nand throughout CBDC.\nB.  Abuse and Neglect\nCBDC does not adequately protect residents from physical and\nverbal abuse and neglect.  While there is a system established to\ninvestigate allegations of abuse, we note that the investigations\nappear to be cursory and typically fail to substantiate abuse\nallegations even in cases where evidence suggests abuse occurred.\nAlthough a number of the abuse investigations we reviewed began\nwhen an injury of unknown origin was found on a resident, the\nincident/injury reports document many more such injuries that\nwere not likewise investigated.  There is no way to determine\nfrom the documentation why one injury of unknown origin is\nconsidered suspected abuse and another is not.  Furthermore,\ngiven the inadequacies of the incident documentation outlined\nabove, many potential incidents of abuse are never investigated.\nVerbal abuse appears prevalent at CBDC.  Direct care staff\neither have not been adequately trained to interact with\nresidents in appropriate ways or have not been adequately\nsupervised.  During our tours, we rarely heard a direct care\nstaff person actually provide praise or positive reinforcement\nwhile interacting with residents.  Many staff did not even speak\nto the residents for whom they were caring, even while doing such\ntasks as feeding the resident or taking the resident to be\nbathed.  Abrupt, verbal commands such as \"SIT DOWN!\" and \"STOP!\"\nappear to be the too frequent method by which staff communicate\nwith residents.  A number of residents' behavior plans actually\ninstruct direct care staff to use those commands, and it was\nreported that staff often scream at residents to comply.\n\n- 5 -\nThe obvious staffing difficulties contribute to the neglect\nof residents who may be left for extended period of time in\nsoiled clothes or engaging in self-injurious behavior unattended.\nFinally, there is evidence that staff are not encouraged to\nreport abuse or neglect and that some staff are intimidated by\nother staff from reporting such incidents.\nII.  Programs to Reduce Maladaptive Behavior and to Provide\nAdaptive Skills Are Inadequate or Non-existent, Subjecting\nResidents to Physical and Mental Harm.\nCBDC does not provide residents with basic, functional, and\nprogressive programming designed to reduce injuries, improve\nresident living skills, eliminate maladaptive and other\nantisocial-behaviors, reduce the amount of supervision that they\nrequire, prepare them for living in the community, or meet the\nspecific individual needs of the residents.  Consequently,\nresidents are at greater risk for injury (e.g., from aggression\nor self-injury), are more likely to remain institutionalized, are\nmore likely to receive physical or chemical restraints, and more\nlikely to receive medication to control their behavior than might\notherwise be necessary.  In sum, the programming and\npsychological services at CBDC are so deficient as to subject\nresidents to serious and continuing harm and risks of harm.\nA.  Psychology and Direct Care Staff\nCBDC currently has one doctoral level psychologist, who is\nthe Director of Psychology, and ten masters level  \"psychological\nexaminers.\"  Psychological examiners are responsible for yearly\nevaluations of residents and the design and follow-up of\nindividual behavior programs, including the training of direct\ncare staff in the implementation of all programs.  Given the\ninsufficient training of psychology and direct care staff, the\ninappropriate environment at CBDC and the number of residents\npresently exhibiting maladaptive behaviors, the caseload of each\npsychological examiner  (between 65 and 120 residents) is far too\nhigh.  Psychology staff are overworked, have no authority, little\nor no professional/clinical support, inadequate training, no\nprofessional/career development, and no expert Ph.D. involvement.\nAt present, there is insufficient professional expertise\navailable at CBDC to develop and implement adequate training and\nbehavior management programs.  In addition, direct care staff,\nwho are primarily responsible for implementing the programs and\ntraining, are insufficient in number and inadequately trained to\nproperly carry out appropriate programming and training.\n\n- 6 -\nB.  Behavior Programs and Training for Residents With\nMaladaptive Behaviors\nCBDC residents with maladaptive and self-injurious behavior\ncontinue to suffer unnecessary injury and restraint, in large\npart because of CBDC's inadequate behavior programming for these\nindividuals.  The necessary precursors to designing adequate\nbehavior programs are proper assessments and functional behavior\nanalyses of the individuals requiring such programs.  CBDC does\nnot conduct proper assessments necessary to design effective\nprograms.  For example, most of the residents at CBDC have severe\ncommunication and language deficits.  Improving a person's\nability to communicate is important in reducing the occurrence of\nmaladaptive behaviors, developing social relationships, and\nincreasing control over one's own environment.  Communication\nassessments at CBDC provide little useful information and\nrecommendations.  In addition, our psychology consultant found no\nevidence that functional behavior analyses have been conducted\nfor any resident.\nThe programs themselves, while generally covering the\nappropriate subject areas, are not individualized for each\nresident  (in some cases the programs are virtually identical),\nare incomplete in necessary details, contain objectives that do\nnot make up a comprehensive, sensible plan, and are not\nimplemented.  Our consultant also determined that the lack of\nreliable data on residents' adaptive and behavioral programs\nseriously compromises the facility's training programs.  Data\nrecorded on many of the behavior and skill data sheets are\nidentical from day to day, giving the appearance that data is\nfabricated or recorded at the end of the day, week, or even\nmonth, making such data meaningless.  Finally, direct care staff\nhave not been adequately trained to implement training programs\nor to address the self-injurious behavior exhibited by many\nresidents.  The emergency physical restraint practiced at CBDC is\nan inherently risky procedure which puts residents at serious\nrisk of harm or even death.  In short, CBDC residents are not\nbeing helped, but are allowed to continue harming themselves,\npeers and sometimes staff day after day, year after year.\nSome of these deficiencies at CBDC are illustrated by the\nevents surrounding a recent study conducted by researchers from\nVanderbilt University at CBDC to examine the effects of the\nmedication, Naltrexone, upon self-injurious behavior.  Although\nthe researchers found that the seven CBDC participants would not\nor could not benefit from the medication, they made a number of\nclinical recommendations for at least some of the participants.\nThese recommendations were comprehensive, addressed the function\nof the self-injury, and applied the latest research in mental\nretardation to the individual resident.  None of these\nrecommendations, however, appear to have been followed\n\n- 7 -\nby CBDC and, moreover, none of the staff members with whom our\nconsultant spoke knew anything about the study or the\nrecommendations.  This is an example of CBDC's inability to apply\nimportant relevant assessment information for the benefit of the\nresidents.  Information which could very well have helped these\nindividuals and prevented further injury and restraint was made\navailable, but was ignored.\nC.  Adaptive Skills Training\nSimilar deficiencies also exist in the programs for the\ndevelopment of functional or adaptive skills.  Training programs\nshould focus on the acquisition of functional skills across a\nrange of settings, people, and target behaviors.  Training such\nas that at CBDC, which is often related to meaningless or\nisolated skills, does not enable the individual to acquire\ncontrol over his/her environment, enhance the individual's\nquality of life, or promote independence.  Staff members do not\nappear to know how to teach skill development to this population\nand, in the few cases where they were trying to teach, they were\noperating under conditions that made it nearly impossible to be\neffective  (e.g., supervising many residents simultaneously,\ninadequate materials available).\nLittle communication and language training is conducted at\nCBDC.  Records indicate that only 12 residents have any kind of\nadapted/augmented communication device.  Communication skills\nmust receive much more emphasis and should be integrated\nthroughout the residents' activities.  Our observations revealed\nfew instances where opportunities to work on communication skills\nwere presented to the residents and even where such opportunities\nwere being presented, the training was not individualized to the\nresidents involved.\nAll of our consultants were shocked at the general lack of\nactivity at CBDC.  For example, our psychology consultant's\nobservations of 18 different living units and training areas\nprimarily during daylight hours revealed that only 26 to 3 6\npercent of the residents were engaged in any activity.  The vast\nmajority of residents were observed sitting doing nothing, lying\ndown or sleeping.  Resident activity schedules contain large\nblocks of time labeled, for example, \"watch TV,\" \"radio,\" \"table\nactivity,\" \"leisure,\" \"self-help,\" or \"given opportunity to\nparticipate in preferred activities\" -- all prescriptions for\nsitting and doing nothing.  Staff also did not appear to follow\nthe schedules.  Similarly, few appropriate supplies were\navailable for teaching new skills, for leisure time, or for\nincreasing engagement.  Many of the materials were broken,\nmissing pieces, or age inappropriate.\nThe residents' boredom from the lack of meaningful or\ninteresting activities, the lack of adequate staff, and the\n\n- 8 -\ninadequacies in the development and implementation of behavioral\nand other training programs at CBDC exacerbate self-injurious\nbehaviors, lead to needless injury, and otherwise harm the\nphysical and mental health of residents.\nD.  Individual With Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA)\nCBDC is not providing its school-age residents with an\nappropriate education in accordance with the requirements of the\nIndividual with Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§\n1400-1486.  The IDEA requires that CBDC develop individualized\neducation plans  (IEPs) designed to meet the needs of qualifying\nchildren.  A review of IEPs developed for children at CBDC showed\nthat they failed to meet this standard.  The goals and objectives\nin the IEPs were extremely limited in their scope.  For example,\nit was common to find only two skills being addressed over a\nthree-year period.\nFurther, the IDEA'S requirement that sufficient  \"related\nservices,\" i.e., physical therapy and behavioral services, be\nprovided to allow children to benefit from the educational\nprogram is clearly not being met.  For example, the physical\ntherapy staff do not interact at all with the educational staff.\nIn addition, children attending the CBDC school could be educated\nin lesser restrictive environments; also a requirement of the\nIDEA.  CBDC must enhance its educational and related services and\nprovide for appropriate placement and services in the local\npublic school systems.\nIll.  Medical and Psychiatric Care is Dangerously Deficient.\nA.  General Medical Care\nThe medical care received by the residents at CBDC is\ndangerously deficient.  Although our consultants reviewed\nindividual instances of appropriate care, medical care generally\nis characterized by \"crisis management,\" with numerous\nindividuals suffering unnecessary pain, injuries and illnesses.\nThe primary cause of this is the grossly inadequate numbers of\ntrained medical personnel presently employed at CBDC.  At the\ntime of our tours, the facility had just hired one additional\nfull-time physician, bringing the total number of physicians to\nthree, which included the acting medical director.  In the\nopinion of the acting medical director, adequate medical care\ncould be provided with five full time physicians and one medical\ndirector.  This would require hiring three more physicians.\nSimilarly, nursing coverage is woefully inadequate to meet the\nneeds of the residents.  According to the CBDC \"Resource Plan,\"\nthe facility would require an additional forty-one Registered\nNurses and fifty-nine Licensed Practical Nurses, just to meet the\nstaffing ratio established by the Department of Mental\nRetardation.\n\n- 9 -\nMoreover, as a general rule, CBDC medical personnel do not\nhave significant experience caring for individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities prior to employment at CBDC, and they\nreceive insufficient orientation before starting work and\npractically no continuing education once they begin work.\nThis inadequate staffing, coupled with inadequate experience\nand training, has the greatest impact on the quality of\npreventive and chronic care.  Records at CBDC, as at the Greene\nValley Developmental Center, demonstrate that CBDC residents are\nsubjected to repeated fractures over many years absent preventive\nmeasures; recurrent aspirations, dysphagia and pneumonias without\na coherent management plan to treat and otherwise address these\nlife-threatening ailments; significant, rapid weight loss\nrepresenting a direct threat to health which was often not\nacknowledged or acted upon by professional staff; inadequate\nmedication administration; and other misdiagnosed or untreated\ninjuries.  Our medical consultants were also struck by the number\nof serious cases of skin breakdown or decubitus ulcers, which\ngenerally indicates that there are too few adequately trained\nstaff to track residents who are at risk for such ulcers and to\nensure residents receive good hygiene and are repositioned\nfrequently.\nSeizure management is also deficient.  In several cases the\nadvice of the consulting neurologist was excellent and the advice\nwas followed by CBDC physicians.  However, the charts of a number\nof other residents indicated that they had not been seen by a\nneurologist for years, had been maintained on anticonvulsant\nmedications despite having no seizures for years, or had been\nmaintained on grossly subtherapeutic doses of anticonvulsants for\nmany months and sometimes more than a year.  Our medical expert\nfound one case where intra-muscular medication was\ninappropriately used to treat a seizure.  In addition, the\ninconsistent recording of seizures by CBDC staff seriously\naffects the legitimacy and efficacy of prescribed medications and\ntreatment.\nIn one representative case, a 48-year-old woman who died in\nOctober 1993, was started on an anticonvulsant after having a\nseizure in the spring of 1993.  Lab tests taken over the next\nseven months showed repeated, substantially subtherapeutic levels\nof the medication in her blood, despite at least two more\nseizures.  One of the seizures, lasting ten minutes and described\nas \"uncontrolled,\" prompted the neurologist to recommend\nincreasing the dosage of the anticonvulsant, but the blood level\nremained subtherapeutic for the next several weeks until her\ndeath.  (The consultant also noted that this resident had a 70\npound weight loss, but the primary care physician's note from the\nprevious month had not remarked on this weight loss and had\nstated only that the patient was \"doing well.\")  The woman had\nanother prolonged seizure, was sent to the hospital, and died the\n\n- 10 -\nnext day, probably as a result of aspiration during her prolonged\nseizure.  In this case, therapeutic drug levels were not actively\npursued by the primary care physician in the face of increasing\nseizure activity.  The resident's dramatic weight loss was also\nnot acted upon.\nEmergency care at CBDC is also inadequate.  CBDC has no\nwritten guidelines as to when 911 should be called.\nTransportation of residents, who are or may be in need of\nimmediate emergency medical care, from their living units to the\nmedical building by non-medical personnel, such as security\nofficers, is generally not appropriate.  Seriously ill or injured\nresidents should be attended and accompanied by trained medical\npersonnel.  Residents who are in need of immediate emergency care\nshould be transported from their living units by EMTs directly to\nthe hospital.\nQuality control, peer review, and coordination mechanisms\nfor medical care are virtually non-existent.  Medical\nrecordkeeping and data collection are also inadequate.\nIndividual medical records are often in disarray, important\ninformation is missing, progress notes and plans are cursory,\ndocuments are misfiled and important physician notes are\nillegible.  Although CBDC has begun to keep lists of individuals\nat risk for various ailments, it is clear that there is a general\nabsence of individual or facility-wide data with respect to\nchronic medical needs of residents.  This absence of information\ncollection not only compromises the care of individual residents,\nbut limits the ability of the medical staff and administration to\nproperly allocate resources, develop plans, and ensure critical\nmedical needs are met.  Our expert consultants found repeated\ninstances, for example, where residents' conditions or risks were\nnoted, but no plan was in place or implemented to correct those\nconditions or reduce the risks.  In cases where data is kept, it\ndoes not appear to be utilized in any useful fashion.\nIn sum, medical care for the most serious needs of the\nfacility's residents is inadequate.  Serious illnesses are not\naddressed in a timely manner.  Preventable illnesses, unnecessary\ninjuries, and other debilitating conditions occur absent\nappropriate professional medical intervention.\nB. Psychiatric Care and the Use of Psychotropic Medication\nPsychiatric services for CBDC are seriously deficient.  This\nis due in large part to the inadequate number of psychiatric\nconsultation hours available at the facility.  The current\nconsulting psychiatrist spends only seven to ten hours a month at\nCBDC even though over 100 CBDC residents are receiving\nmedications that require psychiatric supervision.  This is simply\ninadequate given the potential effects and side effects of the\npsycho-active medications to which CBDC residents are exposed.\n\n- 11 -\nAs mentioned above, CBDC's behavioral treatment system is\ngrossly inadequate.  In the face of an ineffective behavioral\ntreatment system, the use of medication to control residents'\nbehavior becomes even more problematic.  It is essential that,\nbefore medications are used on residents, alternative,\nless-intrusive behavioral therapies are tried and proven to be\nunsuccessful.  However, at CBDC, adequate behavioral therapies\nare not in place.  Thus, medication used to control behavior\nbecomes, per s_e, an inappropriate use of chemical restraint.\nFurther deficiencies also exist in the practices in use at\nCBDC concerning behavior-modifying medications.  The extensive\nuse of benzodiazapines, which have a high percentage of negative\nside effects in a developmentally disabled population, is not\nbeing adequately monitored.  Also, as noted above, behavior data,\ncritical to the analysis of the efficacy of medication, is not\nappropriately collected, graphed or charted in residents'\nrecords.  Further, staff members often present conflicting data\nto the psychiatrist when the psychiatrist performs consults.\nWithout accurate and consistent behavioral data, the use of\npsycho-active medications is inappropriate.\nAdditionally, there is no formal, standardized process for\napproval of residents' medication regimens.  Nor is there a\nphysician on CBDC's Behavior Management or Human Rights\nCommittees.  Further, CBDC's procedures for tracking medication\nside-effects is deficient.  In sum, the use of behavior control\nmedications at CBDC is unacceptable, does not adequately address\nresidents' needs and represents a danger to residents.\nC.  Physical and Nutritional Management\nPhysical and nutritional management at CBDC are deficient.\nMany CBDC residents, like some of the residents at Greene Valley\nDevelopmental Center, are nutritionally at risk due to physical\ndisabilities or other medical problems and are not receiving\nappropriate assistance and training during meals.  Staff who\nassist residents at mealtime must receive special training in\norder to ensure residents' health and safety.  For example,\nfailure to appropriately position residents during meals can lead\nto aspiration, choking, reflux and other health complications.\nAlthough CBDC documents note the importance of positioning and\nfeeding residents properly during and after mealtimes, our\nconsultants' observations revealed that staff were not doing so\nand residents were coughing and choking as a result.  Several\nresidents who are tube fed were also observed improperly\npositioned during and following the feedings.  (None of the\nresidents currently receiving gastronomy feeding have oral\nstimulation programs.)  Although some residents have individual\nfeeding plans or cardexes' designed to instruct staff on how to\nproperly feed the residents, some residents in need of such plans\ndo not have them, and many of the cardexes are cryptic or outdated.\n\n- 12 -\nCBDC also fails to appropriately identify and treat\nindividuals with unhealthy weight loss, eating disorders,\ndysphagia or reflux; all of which, if untreated, can become fatal\nconditions.\nD. Physical Therapy and Positioning of Physically\nHandicapped Residents\nPhysical therapy services at CBDC are seriously deficient.\nDirect care and professional staff generally are untrained in how\nto properly position, transfer or move residents.  There is\nineffective implementation of the individualized habilitation\nplan (\"IHP\") by staff from all services, and functional\nintegration of this plan is lacking.  As in other areas,\nobjective data necessary to establish goals and measure progress\nis generally absent.  There is a need for more physical therapy\nservices for patient evaluation, program development, and\nsupervision of program implementation.  Additional registered\nphysical therapists need to be hired.\nMoreover, our physical therapy consultant identified a\nsignificant number of dangerous practices being conducted by\nthose few individuals actually engaged in physical therapy\nactivities.  For example, technicians routinely lifted or moved\nresidents by grabbing and pulling on their arms or legs -- which\ncan easily result in broken bones for some of these medically\nfragile individuals.  Staff also failed to take simple\nprecautions such as locking wheelchairs before transferring\nresidents in or out of the chairs.\nIn other cases, residents were inappropriately placed or\nallowed to remain in devices or postures which inhibited their\nability to function, and, in some cases, may exacerbate their\ndeformities.  Many of the adaptive wheelchairs and related\nequipment are ill-fitting and inappropriate.  Few of the\nnonambulatory individuals were observed to wear shoes.  This\nplaces them at risk for injury while in their chairs, especially\nbecause many of them did not have proper foot rests and their\nfeet were observed to drag along the floor as they were moved in\ntheir wheelchairs.  Indeed, deficiencies in addressing the needs\nof residents with physical disabilities, especially children, are\nso severe as to represent an active threat to their health and\nsafety.  Appropriate positioning for residents who have multiple\nphysical disabilities is necessary to prevent deterioration of\nresidents' skills, abilities, and health.  Residents languish in\ncarts and ill-fitting wheelchairs, which exacerbate or allow\nphysical deformities to progress --in some cases to a point that\nthe deformity may preclude the person from sitting upright in a\nwheelchair.  This seriously diminishes a person's opportunities\nfor socialization and sensory input.  Such inappropriate\npositioning can, among other things, constrict the lungs, cause\n\n- 13 -\nsecondary lung disease, make it difficult for the heart to pump,\nand increase the likelihood of vomiting, reflux and aspiration.\nFurthermore, accurate and useful documentation of CBDC\nresidents' individual physical therapy status does not exist,\nmaking it impossible to evaluate whether any intervention was\neffective, ineffective or in need of modification.  In fact, many\nresidents reviewed were continued for years on the same programs\nwith little or no progress noted.  Such lack of progress should\nprompt a modification or at least a re-evaluation of the therapy\nprovided.\nIn sum, physical therapy services, including the positioning\nof residents, are so deficient as to represent a direct threat of\nharm to residents.  An acceptable physical therapy program must\nenhance the capacity of the individual to function, i.e.. to help\nhim or her live safely and as independently as possible.\nSporadic passive range of motion \"therapy\" is not sufficient to\nachieve these goals.\nIV.  CBDC's Institutional Environment Fails to Meet the Needs of\nthe Residents.\nIn providing care and services to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, it is essential to furnish them with\nan acceptable and responsive environment that ensures safety and\npromotes learning, development, and their overall well-being.\nSuch environments must be functional and serve to enhance the\nquality of life for the individuals.  Currently accepted\nprofessional standards require that this environment be the least\nseparate, most integrated setting where the individuals needs can\nbe met.  It must be safe, stable, and operate to teach and\nmaintain functional skills, to reduce or pre-empt the occurrence\nof behavior problems, and otherwise promote the independent\nfunctioning of the individual.  CBDC does not meet these\nrequirements.\nThe environment at CBDC is not fully functional for its\nresidents and may be the cause of some of their problem\nbehaviors.  Ironically, it is the presence of these behavior\nproblems, the regression in skills experienced by many residents\nas the result of inadequate care, and the acuity of their\nphysical disabilities produced by other inadequate services that\ndecreases or delays the individuals' opportunity to live in and\nparticipate in community-based programs.\nCBDC fails to appropriately provide for and monitor the\nresidents' personal property or to protect it from theft.  This\ndisregard for residents' personal possessions is reflective of an\nenvironment that devalues the people who are confined at CBDC.\n\n- 14 -\nCBDC is an isolated, self-contained environment which\nseparates its residents with disabilities from the rest of\nsociety.  As a result, the facility fails to provide its\nresidents treatment in an environment that permits contacts with\nsociety and its mainstream social institutions, enables\nindependent functioning, and facilitates contact with family\nmembers.  While a few residents enjoy frequent community outings,\nmany others have very few opportunities to participate in\ncommunity activities and still others apparently never leave the\ninstitution at all.  Data for the fourteen months prior to our\ntours demonstrate that approximately 40 residents never took a\ncommunity trip off grounds and many residents had fewer than six\noutings for the entire year.  Data for the summer of 1994 showed\nthat 191 residents never went off grounds for community or\nrecreational outings during that time.\nThe State must provide these disabled residents an\nopportunity to participate in or benefit from aids, benefits and\nservices equal to that afforded to others outside the\ninstitution; more specifically, to those provided to other\nindividuals with disabilities in the State's established\ncommunity-based programs.  The residents are entitled to aids,\nbenefits and services that are as effective in affording them the\nequal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same\nbenefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as those\nserved in community-based programs.  By confining residents with\ndisabilities at CBDC, the State has failed to provide such\nservices in the least separate, most integrated setting as\nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 12101, e_t sea., and section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct Of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\nThe cases reviewed by our consultants indicate that all of\nCBDC residents could be successfully placed in the community if\nprovided with adequate supports.  The professionals at CBDC are\nin general agreement with this view.  Keeping individuals in an\ninstitution who have been determined to be capable of living in\nthe community cannot be justified.\nIn those few cases where residents have been placed out of\nthe Center, CBDC documents and our discussions with CBDC staff\nindicate that essential transitional services and planning has\nnot taken place.  For example, a deinstitutionalization plan\ndesignating community placement was included in each IHP that our\npsychology consultant reviewed, but the IHPs themselves did not\ncontain objectives or a plan for, or otherwise focus on, this\nlong-term goal.  In addition, CBDC physicians are not involved in\ndischarge planning to the community, and are not asked to provide\ntransfer notes or communicate with community-based physicians\nregarding the medical status and needs of their patients prior or\nsubsequent to their transfer.  Dumping residents into the\n\n- 15 -\ncommunity without adequate planning, services or supports is\nequally unjustifiable.\nV.  Remedial Measures\nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and ensure that the\nrights of CBDC residents are protected, the following remedial\nmeasures need to be implemented promptly.\na.  CBDC must immediately employ and deploy sufficient\nnumbers of competent and trained professional and direct care\nstaff to ensure residents are supervised and adequately protected\nfrom harm and provided appropriate training and other services.\nMeasures must be taken to ensure the timely and accurate\nreporting of abuse and neglect, and the effective investigation\nand resolution of those reports.\nb.  All residents must be evaluated to determine their\nindividual strengths.and weaknesses and to develop appropriate\nindividualized training programs, including behavior management\nand skill acquisition programs.  Immediate attention must be\ngiven to residents with self-injurious, physically abusive and\nother destructive behaviors by identifying them and providing\nnecessary training on a priority basis.  One-to-one staffing must\nbe provided immediately for residents who are at risk of serious\ninjury.  All interdisciplinary evaluations should review the\nindividual's training needs, utilizing a written descriptive\nfunctional analysis for those individuals with problem behaviors,\nand emphasize alternatives to restraints.  Programs should\naddress and develop appropriate strategies to promote the\nphysical, mental, behavioral, and social skills of each resident\nand permit each resident to function as independently as\npossible.  Such programs must be consistently implemented and\nprocedures developed to ensure appropriate review and revision.\nEmphasis should also be placed on teaching residents to\ncommunicate.  Restraint procedures must be revaluated immediately\nand changes made to avoid resident injuries and death by choking\nor asphyxiation.\nc.  CBDC must develop and implement a professionally based,\nindividually appropriate data collection system to measure\nrelevant information about problem behaviors and the conditions\nunder which they occur, including, where appropriate, the\nfrequency, intensity, and duration of the behaviors.  CBDC must\nimplement an appropriate data collection system to ensure that\nadaptive and functional skills training is meeting the needs of\nthe resident involved.  Furthermore, CBDC must review and respond\nto the data collected relating to either behavior programs or\nskill acquisition programs in a timely and appropriate manner.\nd.  Measures must be taken to improve the communication and\nlanguage training provided to CBDC residents.  Similarly, CBDC\n\n- 16 -\nmust assess each resident's need for associated or adapted\ndevices including communication devices, and provide these\ndevices for those individuals in need of them.  Measures must\nalso be taken to improve physical and nutritional management,\nincluding assessing residents at risk for dysphagia, weight loss,\neating disorders and reflux, implementing measures to reduce\nthose risks and teaching staff.\ne.  For each resident, CBDC must reasonably provide for,\nallow the residents access to, and take steps to protect the\nresident's personal property.\n•• f.  CBDC must ensure that each school-aged resident is\nevaluated and provided educational services, included related\naids and services, consistent with the requirements of IDEA.\nEvaluations should be coordinated with the appropriate public\nschool district to ensure that each child receives educational\nservices in the least restrictive, most appropriate, environment\noutside CBDC.  IEPs must be suitably individualized and contain\nfunctional objectives.\ng.  CBDC must hire, train and deploy adequate numbers of\ncompetent and qualified medical care staff, including physicians\nand nurses, to meet the medical needs of the residents.  CBDC\nmust provide enhanced training opportunities to the present\nphysician staff to teach them skills necessary to care for\nphysically disabled, developmentally disabled persons.  CBDC must\nincrease the number of hours of consulting and contract\nprofessionals, especially those for psychiatry, to a level\nsufficient to provide adequate care.  CBDC should arrange for a\nphysiatrist to provide regular consultation.  CBDC must ensure\nthat enough adequately trained medical professionals, including\nnurses and pharmacists, are employed to institute appropriate\nquality assurance mechanisms, especially to oversee the\nprescription, administration, and monitoring of psychotropic and\nanticonvulsant medications, and to provide timely prevention,\ntreatment and follow-up of medical problems.\nh.  CBDC must provide adequate and timely medical care,\nincluding appropriate services to meet the acute, chronic and\nemergency medical care needs of residents.  CBDC must develop an\nadequate protocol for emergencies, which, among other things,\nlimits the prior practice of transporting seriously ill or\nobviously injured or ill residents unaccompanied by trained\nmedical personnel.  CBDC must ensure that physicians are\nimmediately available to CBDC residents at night and on weekends.\nDevelop and implement procedures and protocols for tracking\nsentinel health events and managing acute and chronic illnesses.\nMeasures should be taken to reduce incidents of skin breakdown or\ndecubitus ulcers.\n\n- 17 -\ni.  Residents on psychotropic and anticonvulsant medications\nshould be evaluated to determine the appropriateness of their\nprescriptions and whether these medications are being prescribed\nand monitored in accordance with accepted professional standards.\nPsychotropic medications must not be used without an adequate\nrationale and a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric diagnosis, nor as\npunishment, in lieu of a training program for behavior control,\nnor for the convenience of staff.  Residents must not be kept on\nanticonvulsant medications  (or inappropriate doses of those\nmedications) that serve no therapeutic purpose or are otherwise\ncontraindicated.\nj.  Medical records must be kept in a fashion sufficient to\nallow medical professionals to provide adequate and timely care.\nAn up-to-date problem list specific to each resident should be\nmaintained in each resident's chart.  Regular communication among\nmedical staff must be established and enhanced.  An adequate\nsystem must be developed for tracking and monitoring seizure\ndisorders, and medical staff, as well as direct care staff,\nshould be adequately trained in seizure management.  A seizures\nprotocol should be developed, which, among other things,\ndescribes the appropriate administration of anticonvulsants.\nk.  CBDC must hire, deploy and train sufficient numbers of\nspecialty service providers, including qualified physical\ntherapists, physical therapy technicians, occupational therapists\noccupational therapy assistants, and speech pathologists, to\nensure that residents are provided appropriate physical and\noccupational therapy, including positioning, the use of adaptive\ndevices, eating, and ambulation, and other functional skills\ntraining.\n1.  Immediate steps must be taken to develop and implement\nan overall plan to significantly reduce the size of the facility\nand to place residents in appropriate, less restrictivej\ncommunity-based programs.  There should be an immediate ban on\nthe admission of children, except in emergency circumstances, and\nchildren should be prioritized for placement in alternate,\nproperly supported community-based programs.  In the meantime,\nresidents should receive training to assist in their placement\nand transition to community-based living arrangements.  Residents\nshould also be adequately assessed to identify services necessary\nto meet their needs in the community.  CBDC staff must take a\ngreater role in helping to ensure that residents' placements into\nthe community are appropriate and successful.\nLarge, congregate residential institutions have been\ndemonstrated to be ill-equipped to provide the care, education,\nand training needed to promote the growth and development of\ndevelopmentally disabled and mentally retarded persons.  See.\nHalderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital. No. 74-\n\n- 18 -\n1345, slip op. at 1, 4-9  (E.D. Pa. March 29, 1994).  The national\ntrend is to serve these individuals in appropriate, alternative\ncommunity-based programs and facilities which can meet their\nindividual needs.  Given the gravity and scope of our experts'\nfindings regarding the deficient care provided at CBDC, the\ndevelopment of more appropriate settings and services for the\nresidents of CBDC is necessary.\nSincerely,\nDeval L.

During the week of September 19, 19 94, we  toured\nthe facility accompanied by consultants  in the fields  of\nmedicine, psychology, nursing and physical therapy.  We wish to\nexpress our appreciation  for the cooperation shown by the GVDC\nstaff and the representatives  from the Department  of  Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation and the Attorney General's  office\nduring this investigation.  On September 24, 1994, we conveyed  to\nthe. facility superintendent and other state officials an  initial\nassessment of deficiencies at the facility.  Our full  assessment\nof conditions at GVDC has now been  completed.\nWe regret to advise you that we found numerous  conditions  at\nGVDC that violate the constitutional  and federal statutory  rights\nof the residents there.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment  and\nrelevant  federal statutes, residents of state-operated  facilities\nfor the developmentally disabled and mentally retarded have a\nright to, inter alia, adequate medical care, reasonably  safe\nconditions, and training sufficient to protect each  resident's\nliberty interests, including training to permit each resident  an\nopportunity to function as independently as possible.  Programs\nmust be provided to teach adaptive skills, including  self-help,\ncommunication, and social skills.  In addition,  individuals  with\ndevelopmental disabilities must be provided services  in\ncommunity-based programs where appropriate.

Medical Care is Dangerously Deficient.\nA.  General Medical Care\nDue to an inadequate medical care delivery system,\nespecially the failure to provide adequate preventive and chronic\ncare, GVDC residents are subjected to needless fractures,\nrecurrent aspiration, preventable weight loss, recurring\nseizures, avoidable injuries, and other direct threats to their\nhealth.  Records of residents reviewed by our medical consultant\nindicate, for example, repeated fractures over many years absent\npreventive measures; recurrent aspirations, dysphagia and\npneumonias without a coherent management plan to treat and\notherwise address these life-threatening ailments; significant,\nrapid weight loss representing a direct threat to health which\nwas often not acknowledged or acted upon by professional staff;\nmultiple drug use absent adequate justification; and other\nmisdiagnosed or untreated injuries.  Significantly, the lack of\nindividual or facility-wide data with respect to these urgent\nmedical needs of residents not only compromises the care of\nindividual residents, but limits the ability of the medical staff\nand administration to properly allocate resources, develop plans,\n1/(...continued)\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794,\net sea.; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1356,\net sea, (and implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. § 483.420 -\n480); Younabera v.

In sum, medical care\nfor the most serious needs of the facility's residents is\ninadequate and fails to comport with generally accepted medical\nstandards.\nIn addition, medication practices are deficient.  There are\nnumerous residents who have been prescribed multiple\nanticonvulsant and/or psychotropic medications for years.  Ir.\nview of the potential risks associated with many of these\nmedications, including potential for toxicity, tardive\ndyskir.esia, and reduced cognition, it is generally accepted by\nmedical professionals that polypharmacy or the prescription of\nmultiple medications should be avoided where possible.  However,\nGVDC physicians continue to prescribe such medications absent any\nrational justification in violation of medical standards.\nIndeed, psychotropic medications are used on a routine basis at\nthe facility absent adequate rationale or a psychiatric or\nneuropsychiatric diagnosis.  The ubiquitous use of anticonvulsant\nand psychotropic medication also indicates inadequate\nconsultation with neurologists and psychiatrists.  These\npractices are unacceptable.\nThe absence of adequate participation of psychiatrists in\nthe treatment of residents is particularly significant.  For\nthose dually diagnosed individuals who need both behavioral\nprogramming and medication for their mental illness, it is\ncritical that both treatment modalities be integrated properly.\nThe unavailability of adequate psychiatric consultation has\nseverely impeded the ability of GVDC to address the needs of\nthose residents.  The inappropriate use of psychotropic\nmedication is a direct result of this deficiency.\nQuality control, peer review, and coordination mechanisms\nfor medical care are virtually non-existent.  The relationships\nbetween physicians and other personnel such as occupational\ntherapists, physical therapists, psychologists, and nurses is\nill-defined.  Although GVDC's policies require that physicians <\norder certain therapies, there is no mechanism to ensure that\nthose needing the various therapies receive such orders.  Medical\nstaff meetings apparently take place only sporadically.  There is\nno regular morning report among physicians and nurses, and no\n\"on-call\" or physician duty logs are regularly kept.  Medical\nrecords are deficient in that important reports are misfiled and\ncannot be located.  Progress notes are illegible as well.  Such\nlapses in medical care delivery violate basic medical standards.\nIn the view of our consultants, most of these deficiencies\ncan be attributed to the absence of adequately trained medical\nprofessionals, including physicians and nurses.  The currer.:\nphysician staff is inadequately trained, organized and supervised\nto provide adequate medical care.  Some of the physicians have\nlittle training or experience in working with developmentally .\n\n- 4 -\ndisabled persons and few protocols have been developed to provide\nguidelines to the staff.  For example, no protocols or procedures\nare in place cr. the subjects of tracking or managing emergencies,\naspirations, weight loss or gain, dysphagia, or seizures.\nPolicies regarding the frequency-and tracking of tardive\ndyskinesia screenings and hepatitis vaccinations should be\ndeveloped.  Moreover, there has been little effort to provide\nmedical staff with continuing education.  The lack of trained\nmedical staff has significantly compromised medical care at GVDC.\nIn sum, the medical care system at GVDC is seriously\ndeficient.  Serious illnesses are not addressed in a timely\nmanner.  Preventable illnesses, unnecessary injuries, and other\ndebilitating conditions occur absent appropriate professional\nmedical intervention.\nB.  Physical and Nutritional Management\nMany residents at \"GVDC are nutritionally at risk due to\nphysical disabilities or other medical problems and are not\nreceiving appropriate assistance and training during meals.\nFailure to appropriately position residents during meals can lead\nto aspiration, choking, reflux and other health complications.\nStaff who assist residents at mealtime must receive special\ntraining in order to ensure residents' health and safety.\nAlthough we observed one meal at which residents were generally\nbeing fed appropriately, on many other occasions we observed\nresidents eating in poor positions and the meal plans  (\"red\ncards\") that were available were often either not followed or not\nappropriate for the particular resident for whom the plan was\ndeveloped.\nC. Physical Therapy and Positioning of' Physically\nHandicapped Residents\nPhysical therapy services at GVDC are seriously deficient.\nOne physical therapist for a population of over 600 residents,\nmany of whom have physical disabilities and a related need for\nphysical therapy services, does not allow the provision of\nadequate and appropriate physical therapy services.  In fact,\nonly 72 residents are currently receiving such services in spite\nof the large number of residents in the GVDC population who\nrequire such services.  Ill-trained physical therapy technicians\nfail to fill the void left by the lack of an adequate number of\nphysical therapists.\nMoreover, our physical therapy consultant identified a\nsignificant number of dangerous practices being conducted by\nthose few individuals actually engaged in physical therapy\nactivities.  For example, technicians routinely failed to take\nsimple precautions such as locking wheelchairs from which\nresidents were transferred to a position for walking.  Review of\n\n- 5 -\nincident reports shows that approximately 13 percent of the\ninjuries reported resulted from inappropriate handling of\nresidents during transfer or in use of their wheelchair.  No\ntechnician ostensibly providing physical therapy was observed\nendeavoring to teach residents any skills.  Technicians used the\nsame walker for multiple residents with broad differences in gait\nand height.  Indeed, deficiencies in addressing the needs of\nresidents with physical disabilities, especially children, are so\nsevere as to represent an active threat to their health and\nsafety.\nAppropriate positioning for residents who have multiple\nphysical disabilities is necessary to prevent deterioration of\nresidents' skills, abilities, and health.  Our physical therapy\nconsultant ~ade numerous observations of inadequately and\nimproperly positioned residents.  Many residents were observed in\nwheelchairs which did not adequately support them.  All sling\nseat and sling back chairs observed were inappropriate.  Chairs\nwere also not appropriately designed and constructed to manage\nscoliosis and other spinal malalignments.  Other chairs were\nsimply too small for the residents using them.  Physically\ndisabled residents not in wheelchairs were likewise observed to\nbe placed consistently in inappropriate positions.\nFurthermore, accurate and useful documentation of an\nindividual's physical therapy status does not exist, making it\nimpossible to evaluate whether any intervention was effective,\nineffective or in need of modification.  In fact, many residents\nreviewed were continued for years on the same programs with\nlittle or no progress noted, which would require a modification\nor at least a re-evaluation of the therapy provided.\nIn sum, physical therapy services, including the positioning\nof residents, are so deficient as to represent a direct threat of\nharm to residents.\nII.  Residents of GVDC Are Not Adequately Protected From Harm or\nthe Serious Risks of Harm Due to Lack of Supervision.\nDirect care staffing is so deficient that many GVDC\nresidents are harmed and are at substantial risk of harm because\nof the lack of adequate numbers of competent and qualified staff.\nOur observations and review of documents reveal that numerous\ninjuries occur to residents which staff do not observe as they\nhappen or do observe and fail to prevent.  Residents are\nrepeatedly \"found with blood\" on them from injuries that occur\noutside of staff supervision.  On other occasions, residents'\nsevere injuries are discovered only during bathing or at bedtime.\nIn such instances, the staff report that they are unaware of the\ncause of the injuries.  Such a high degree of unexplained\ninjuries is unacceptable.\n\n- 6 -\nSome residents at GVDC repeatedly engage in self-abusive and\nother self-injurious behavior, such as serious head slapping or\ngouging their wounds.  For instance, one eleven year old boy\napparently lest the sight in one eye from repeated headslappir.g\nwhich resulted in a detached retina.  Other residents were noted\nwith swollen, disfigured features resulting from years of\nself-injury.  Still others had permanent scars from continual\nself-mutilation of their faces and arms.\nIncident reports detail a variety of unexplained and serious\nincidents and injuries at GVDC.  Although not all accidents can\nbe prevented, many of. the injuries suffered by GVDC residents are\npreventable products of inadequate staff supervision or\nintervention. 2./\nOver one third of the injuries reported in incident reports\n-- lacerations, fractures and bruises -- result from residents'\nbehaviors, including sejf-injury and aggression.  Many of these\nincident/injury reports concluded with the notation that the\ninjury was \"unavoidable due to resident's behavior,\" reflecting\nthe facility's lack of confidence in either the residents'\nability to learn alternative behaviors or in the facility's\ncapacity to provide appropriate supervision and training.  The\nmost frequent recommended response to these incidents is for\nstaff to engage in closer supervision.  Such supervision is\nimpossible given current staffing levels.\nThe number of unexplained injuries reflected in the incident\nreports is particularly disturbing because staff reported that\nminor injuries of unknown cause are intentionally not reported.\nAs such, the reported injuries do not reflect the entire range of\ninjuries of unknown origin.  Out of a sample of ten residents\nobserved during the tour as exhibiting recent notable injuries,\n60 percent of the residents had injuries for which no incident\nreport could be located.  Several other reports contained\ndescriptions of injuries that did not accurately reflect the\ninjury observed.\nIn sum, there is an unacceptable level of injury at GVDC.\nThe level of injuries of unknown origin is also greatly\ndisturbing.\n2.1 Approximately 40 percent of incident/injury reports\nreviewed shewed an injury due to falls.  Such injuries can be\ndivided into falls due to seizure activity, falls due to gait or\ninstability problems, particularly in cramped areas, or\naggression by other residents.  While some seizure-related falls\nmay be difficult to prevent, GVDC is aware of residents whose\ngait or behavior problems contribute to their falls and should be\nable to prevent many more of those injuries.\n\n- 7 -\nIII.  Programs to Reduce Maladaptive Behavior and to Provide\nAdaptive Skills Are Inadequate or Non-existent, Subjecting\nResidents to Physical and Mental Harm.\nDeficiencies in the program services at GVDC, including both\nprograms designed to eliminate maladaptive and other anti-social\nbehaviors as well as programs to teach residents adaptive and\nother skills, are significant.  Indeed, the deficiencies are so\nsevere that the absence of necessary programs subjects residents\nto harm and unreasonable risks of harm.  Furthermore, services do\nnot provide residents with the necessary skills to enhance their\nindependence or promote and maintain residents' physical and\nmental health.\nA.  Psychology Staff is Inadequate to Provide Necessary\nServices\nGVDC currently has^ two doctoral level psychologists and\neight masters level \"psychological examiners.\"  Psychological\nexaminers are responsible for yearly evaluations of residents and-\nthe design and follow-up of individual behavior programs,\nincluding the training of direct care staff in the implementation\nof all programs.  At present, each psychological examiner has a\ncaseload of between 80 and 90 residents -- far too many.  In\naddition, supervision of the psychological examiners by the Ph.D.\npsychologists is inadequate.  At present, there is insufficient\nprofessional expertise available at GVDC to develop and implement\nadequate training and behavior management programs.\nB.  Behavior Programs Are Not Adequately Designed or\nImplemented to Train Residents With Maladaptive Behaviors\nSignificantly, many residents who need behavior programs do\nnot have such programs.  Their destructive behaviors remain\nunaddressed.  For example, one resident had large scratches on\nher face that had been self-inflicted; our consultant\npsychologist was informed that there was no program to modify or\neliminate this unsafe behavior.  Staff described the wound on the\nforehead of another resident as a wound that the resident\nfrequently re-opens; there was no program to correct this\nbehavior and our consultant was advised that staff \"just leave it\nalone.\"  An older gentleman who had a history of pica  (eating\nforeign objects) documented in his record dating back to 1977 was\nobserved eating artificial grass and hitting his face; there is\nno program to correct these behaviors.  The failure of\nprofessional staff to develop and implement behavior programs to\naddress these and other dangerous behaviors represents a clear\ndanger to residents, and is unacceptable.\nThose behavior programs in place at GVDC, known as \"goal\nplans,\" fail to comport with generally accepted professional\nstandards in that they are not designed to accomplish changes in\n\n• - t\n- 8 -\nresidents' behavior or functional ability.  Few of the goal plans\nare accompanied by a professionally based functional analysis of\nthe resident's behavior -- a necessary first step in the\ndevelopment of a behavior program.  Absent an adequate\nassessment, an adequate behavior program cannot be developed.\nIn addition, the behavior programs at GVDC are not\nindividualized to meet the needs of the particular residents for\nwhom they have been developed.  Moreover, although staff reported\nthat all behavior programs and skill acquisition programs are\nmodified in the absence of progress, a review of records\nreflected many programs which had not been modified where no\nprogress had been shown for protracted periods of time.  Our\nconsultant also determined that the lack of reliable data or.\nresidents' adaptive and behavioral programs seriously compromised\nthe facility's training programs.  Finally, direct care staff\nhave not been adequately trained to implement training programs\nor to address the self-,injurious behavior exhibited by many\nresidents.\nC.  Adaptive Skills Training is Inadequate\nSimilar deficiencies also exist in the programs for the\ndevelopment of functional or adaptive skills.  Training programs\nshould focus on the acquisition of functional skills across a\nrange of settings, people, and target behaviors.  Training such\nas that at GVDC, which is often related to meaningless or\nisolated skills, does not enable the individual to acquire\ncontrol over his/her environment, affect the individual's quality\nof life, or promote independence.  Communication skills in\nparticular should receive much more emphasis than is currently\nprovided at GVDC and should be integrated throughout the\nresidents' activities.  While some of the communication boards\nand devices were excellent, many individuals who needed such-\ndevices did not have them.  Our observation revealed few\ninstances where opportunity to work on communication skills was\npresented to the residents and even where such skills were being\npresented, the training was not individualized to the residents\ninvolved.  For example, a staff person was attempting to teach\nresidents with no verbal skills the word \"fork\" without either a\npicture board or an attempt to teach a sign.  Also, while a\ntoilet training team has been developed at GVDC, many residents\nwho could benefit from such training do not receive it.\n•  •A significant factor to the ineffectiveness of the\nprogramming at GVDC is the utter lack of reliable data being\ncollected on residents' adaptive and behavioral programs.  During\nan entire week on-site at GVDC, we observed data being collected\non only two occasions.  The lack of reliable data makes it\nimpossible to determine the efficacy of programs and forces the\nresidents to lose valuable training time by remaining in\nineffective programming.\n\n- 9 -\nThe inadequacies in the development and implementation of\nbehavioral and other training programs at GVDC exacerbates\nself-injurious behaviors, leads to needless injury, and otherwise\nharms the physical and mental health of residents.\nD.  Individual With Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA)\nThe school-aged children at the facility fail to receive a\nfree and appropriate public school education as required by the\nIDEA and its implementing regulations.  The IDEA requires that\nchildren with disabilities be educated with children who are\nnon-disabled \"to the-maximum extent appropriate.\"  The Individual\nEducation Plans  (IEPs) at GVDC do not reflect the need for the\nchildren who are not educated in the public schools to remain at\nthe institution for educational services.  The provision of\nservices for students aged 14-21 in a local elementary school is\nnot an appropriate placement for those individuals.  Moreover,\nphysical therapy and other services related to the provision of\nspecial education also fall far below accepted professional\npractices.  Physical therapy interventions which directly relate\nto the goals of students' individual education plans are not\nintegrated into each student's classroom activities.\nCommunication skills are not effectively addressed in current\nindividualized habilitation plans  (IHPs) and IEPs.  Opportunities\nfor training are also limited inappropriately in that objectives\nare written to require only limited trials of any particular\nskill.  In addition, many objectives do not appear to have a\nfunctional purpose for the individual student.\nWe note that most states have for many years declined to\ninstitutionalize children because institutional environments\nrepeatedly have been demonstrated to be harmful to the full\nemotional, physical, and intellectual development of\ndevelopmentally disabled children.  Such harm is particularly\nacute in a facility like GVDC where conditions consistently fail\nto meet legal and professional standards.\nIV.  GVDC's Institutional Environment Fails to Meet the Needs of\nthe Residents.\nIn providing care and services to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, it is essential to furnish them with\nan acceptable and responsive environment that ensures safety, and\npromotes learning, development, and their overall well-being.\nSuch environments must be functional and serve to enhance the\nquality of life for the individuals.  Currently accepted\nprofessional standards require that this environment be the least\nseparate, most integrated setting where the individuals needs can\nbe met.  It must be safe, stable, and operate to teach and\nmaintain functional skills, to reduce or pre-empt the occurrence\nof behavior problems, and otherwise promote the independent\n\n- 10 -\nfunctioning of the individual.  GVDC meets none of these\nrequirements.\nThe environment at GVDC is not fully functional for its\nresidents and may be the cause of some of their problem\nbehaviors.  Ironically, it is the presence of these behavior\nproblems, the regression in skills experienced by many residents\nas the result of inadequate care, and the acuity of their\nphysical disabilities produced by other inadequate services that\ndecreases or delays the individuals' opportunity to live in and\nparticipate in community-based programs.\nGVDC is an isolated, self-contained environment which\nnecessarily separates its residents with disabilities from the\nrest of society.  As a result, the facility fails to provide its\nresidents treatment in an environment that permits contacts with\nsociety and its mainstream social institutions, enables\nindependent functioning,, and facilitates contact with family\nmembers.  While some few residents enjoy frequent community\noutings, many others have very few opportunities to participate\nin community activities and still others apparently never leave\nthe institution at all.  The State must provide these disabled\nresidents an opportunity to participate in or benefit from aids,\nbenefits and services equal to that afforded to others outside\nthe institution; more specifically, to those provided to other\nindividuals with disabilities in the State's established\ncommunity-based programs.  The residents are entitled to aids,\nbenefits and services that are as effective in affording them the\nequal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same\nbenefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as those\nserved in community-based programs.  By confining residents with\ndisabilities at GVDC, the State has failed to provide such\nservices in the least separate, most integrated setting as\nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42\nU.S.C. § 12101, e_t sea. , and section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct Of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et sea.\nThe cases reviewed by our consultants indicate that all, or\nnearly all, of GVDC residents could be successfully placed in the\ncommunity if provided with adequate supports.  This view is not\ndisputed by the professionals at GVDC.  Keeping individuals in an\ninstitution who have been determined to be capable of living in\nthe community cannot be justified.\nV.  Remedial Measures\nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and ensure that the\nrights of GVDC residents are protected, the following remedial\nmeasures need to be implemented promptly.\na.  Hire, train and deploy adequate numbers of competent and\nqualified medical care staff, including physicians and nurses,-to\n\n- 11 -\nmeet the medical needs of the residents.  Provide enhanced\ntraining opportunities to the present physician staff to teach\nthem skills necessary to care for physically disabled,\ndevelopmentally disabled persons.  Increase the number of hours\nof consulting and contract professionals, especially those for\nneurology and psychiatry, to a level sufficient to provide\nadequate care.  Arrange for a physiatrist to provide regular\nconsultation.  Ensure that enough adequately trained medical\nprofessionals, including nurses and pharmacists, are employed to\ninstitute appropriate quality assurance mechanisms, especially to\noversee the prescription, administration, and monitoring of\npsychotropic and anticonvulsant medications, and to provide\ntimely prevention, treatment and follow-up of medical problems.\nb.  Provide adequate and timely medical care, including\nappropriate services to meet the acute, chronic and emergency\nmedical care needs of residents.  Ensure that physicians are\nimmediately available to GVDC residents at night and on weekends.\nDevelop and implement procedures and protocols for tracking\nsentinel health events and managing acute and chronic illnesses.\nc.  Residents on psychotropic or anticonvulsant medications\nshould be evaluated to determine the appropriateness of their\nprescriptions and whether these medications are being prescribed\nand monitored in accordance with accepted professional standards.\nPsychotropic medications must not be used without an adequate\nrationale and a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric diagnosis, nor as\npunishment, in lieu of a training program for behavior control,\nnor for the convenience of staff.  Residents must not be kept on\nanticonvulsant medications  (or inappropriate doses of those\nmedications) that serve no therapeutic purpose or are otherwise\ncontraindicated.  The practice of using standing \"PRN\" orders for\npotent medications such as Ativan should be discontinued.\nd.  Medical records must be kept in a fashion sufficient to\nallow medical professionals to provide adequate and timely care.\nRegular communication among medical staff must be established and\nenhanced.  An adequate system must be developed for tracking and\nmonitoring seizure disorders, and medical staff, as well as\ndirect care staff, should be adequately trained in seizure\nmanagement.\ne.  GVDC must hire, deploy and train sufficient numbers of\nspecialty service providers, including qualified physical\ntherapists, physical therapy technicians, occupational therapists\noccupational therapy assistants, and speech pathologists, to\nensure that residents are provided appropriate physical and\noccupational therapy, including positioning, the use of adaptive\ndevices, eating, and ambulation, and other functional skills\ntraining, including communication skills.\n\n- 12 -\nf.  GVDC must employ and deploy sufficient numbers of\ncompetent and trained professional and direct care staff to\nensure residents are supervised and adequately protected frc~\nharm and provided appropriate training and other services.\ng.  All residents must be evaluated to determine their\nindividual strengths and weaknesses and to develop appropriate\nindividualized training programs, including behavior manage~=-t\nand skill acquisition programs.  Immediate attention must be\ngiven to residents with self-injurious, physically abusive and\nother destructive behaviors by identifying them and providing\nnecessary training on a priority basis.  All interdisciplinary\nevaluations should review the individual's training needs,\nutilizing a written descriptive functional analysis for those\nindividuals with problem behaviors, and emphasize alternatives to\nrestraints.  Programs should address and develop appropriate\nstrategies to promote the physical, mental, behavioral, and\nsocial skills of each resident and permit each resident to\nfunction as independently as possible.  Such programs must be\nconsistently implemented and procedures developed to ensure\nappropriate review and revision.\nh.  GVDC must develop and implement a professionally based,\nindividually appropriate data collection system to measure\nrelevant information about problem behaviors and the conditions\nunder which they occur, including, where appropriate, the\nfrequency, intensity, and duration of the behaviors.  GVDC must\nimplement an appropriate data collection system to ensure that\nadaptive and functional skills training is meeting the needs of\nthe resident involved.  Furthermore, GVDC must review and respond\nto the data collected relating to either behavior programs or\nskill acquisition programs in a timely and appropriate manner.\ni.  GVDC must ensure that each school-aged resident is\nevaluated and provided educational services, included related\naids and services, consistent with the requirements of IDEA.\nEvaluations should be coordinated with the appropriate public\nschool district to ensure that each child receives educational\nservices in the least restrictive, most appropriate, environment\noutside GVDC.  IEPs must be suitably individualized and contain\nfunctional objectives.\nj.  Immediate steps must be taken to develop and implement\nan overall plan to significantly reduce the size of the facility\nand to place residents in appropriate, less restrictive,\ncommunity-based programs.  There should be an immediate ban on\nthe admission of children, except in emergency circumstances, and\nchildren should be prioritized for placement in alternate,\nproperly supported community-based programs.  In the meantime,\nresidents should receive training to assist in their placement\nand transition to community-based living arrangements.  Residents\n\n- 13 -\nshould also be adequately assessed to identify services necessary\nto meet their needs in the community.\nLarge, congregate residential institutions have been\ndemonstrated to be ill-equipped to provide the care, educatior.,\nand training needed to promote the growth and development of\ndevelopmentally disabled and mentally retarded persons.  See,\ne.o. , Halderrr.an v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital, No. 74-\n1345, slip op. at 1, 4-9  (E.D. Pa. March 29, 1994).  The national\ntrend is to serve these individuals in appropriate, alternative\ncommunity-based programs and facilities which can meet their\nindividual needs.  Given the gravity and scope of our experts'\nfindings regarding the deficient care provided at GVDC, the\ndevelopment of more appropriate settings and services for the\nresidents of GVDC is necessary.\nDeval L.

Tennessee\n5/2/95  IIH ||  IIH ||  || HI!|1 HI\nMR-TN-004-004\nDLP:AEP:LJW:RCB:VH:LJ:JY:cmw\nDJ 168-70-22\nMay 12, 1995\nThe Honorable Don Sundquist\nGovernor\nState of Tennessee\nState Capitol\nNashville, Tennessee  37219\nRe:  Nat T. Winston Developmental Center\nDear Governor Sundquist:\nOn June 23, 1994, we advised Governor McWherter of this\nDepartment's intent to investigate conditions at the Nat T.\nWinston Developmental Center  (NTWDC) in Bolivar, Tennessee,\npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\n(CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  During the months of November 1994\nand January 1995 we toured the facility with expert consultants\nto examine conditions of resident care and treatment at the\nfacility.  We want to thank the NTWDC staff and the\nrepresentatives from the Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation and the Attorney General's office for their\ncooperation during this investigation.  Following each of our\ntours, we conveyed to the facility superintendent and other state\nofficials an initial assessment of deficiencies at the facility.\nAs state officials are already aware, we found numerous\nconditions at NTWDC that violate the constitutional and federal\nstatutory rights of the residents there.  As we have set forth in\nprevious findings letters to you, under the Fourteenth Amendment\nand relevant federal statutes, residents of state-operated\nfacilities for the developmentally disabled and mentally retarded\nhave a right to, inter alia, adequate medical care, reasonably\nsafe conditions, and training sufficient to protect each\nresident's liberty interests, including training to permit each\nresident an opportunity to function as independently as possible.\nPrograms must be provided to teach adaptive skills, including\nself-help, communication, and social skills.  In addition,\nindividuals with developmental disabilities must be provided\ncc:  Records Chrono Peabody Weinstein Bowman Hughes<!>Jackson Yost Hold\n\n- 2 -\nservices in community-based programs where appropriate. 1/\nNTWDC is not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities\nAct of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seg., Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and Title XIX of the\nSocial Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq., as well as the\nregulations implementing these federal statutes.  Our review also\nindicates that the rights of the residents guaranteed by\nTennessee state law are also being violated.  See, e.g.. Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 33-3-104 and § 33-5-201.\nMany of the deficient conditions and practices we identified\nat NTWDC are similar to those set forth in our earlier findings\nletters regarding conditions at the Clover Bottom Developmental\nCenter and the Greene Valley Developmental Center.  You may wish\nto review those letters in light of the findings contained in\nthis letter.\nThe general facts that support our findings of unconsti-\ntutional conditions and violations of federal statutory rights at\nNTWDC are set forth below.\nI.  NTWDC Residents Are Being Subjected to Harm and Undue Bodily\nand Chemical Restraint Due to the Lack of Effective\nBehavioral Treatment Programs .\nMany residents of NTWDC have behavioral disorders that\nrequire professionally developed behavior treatment programs in\norder to keep the residents safe from either self-inflicted\ninjury or injury as a result of another resident's behavior, and\nto prevent the undue use of chemical or bodily restraints as a\nmeans of controlling residents.  Effective behavioral treatment\nprograms are completely lacking at NTWDC.\ni/  See, e.g.. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12132, et seg.  (and implementing\nregulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(1), and 28 C.F.R. 35.130(d))\n;\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794;\nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, e_t seq.\n(and implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.420 - 480);\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982); United States v.\nTennessee, No. 92-2062, slip op.  (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 17, 1994);\nHalderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital, No. 874-1345,\nslip op. (E.D. Pa. March 29, 1994); Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp.\n& Training School, 7 57 F. Supp. 1243  (D.N.M. 1990), rev'd in part\non other grounds, 964 F.2d 980  (10th Cir. 1992); Thomas S. by\nBrooks v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178  (W.D.N.C. 1988), aff'd 902\nF.2d 250  (4th Cir.), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 951  (1990); Clark v.\nCohen, 613 F. Supp. 684  (E.D. Pa. 1985), aff'd. 794 F.2d 79 (3d\nCir.  1986) cert. denied, 479 U.S. 962  (1986); Gary W. v.\nLouisiana, 437 F. Supp. 1209  (E.D. La. 1976) .\n\n- 3 -\nThe foundation upon which all behavioral treatment is based\nis an adequate assessment of a resident's behavior to determine\nthe cause of the behavior.  At NTWDC, however, assessments do not\naddress relevant factors, such as environmental or medical\nconditions, when considering reasons underlying resident\nbehavior.  Further, in those cases where assessments are\nperformed, they are done only on an informal basis, without\nsufficient, reliable data being taken.  Without reliable data, it\nis simply not possible to develop adequately individualized\nbehavioral treatment programs designed to address the needs of\nNTWDC residents.\nIn the absence of adequate assessments, NTWDC typically\nproceeds on a \"trial and error\" basis in addressing residents'\nbehavioral treatment needs.  As a result of this approach, NTWDC\nis relying to an excessive degree on a variety of restrictive\nprocedures to control problem behaviors.  In fact, almost half of\nNTWDCs residents on behavioral programs have some form of\nrestrictive procedures included in their programs.  We noted that\nmany of the programs were quite similar, containing \"boilerplate\"\nlanguage and clearly lacking appropriate individualization.\nThe monitoring and reviewing of behavioral programs is also\nseriously deficient.  NTWDC places residents on behavioral\nprograms and continues residents on those programs despite the\nprograms' obvious ineffectiveness.  Although the psychology staff\nat NTWDC appear motivated to provide appropriate services, there\nare too few of them and they lack the necessary experience and\ntraining necessary for work with individuals with serious\nbehavior issues or skill deficits.  In addition, the psychology\nstaff is not able to ensure that their programs are implemented\nas designed, which contributes to the ineffectiveness of programs\nat NTWDC.\nNTWDC, because of the ineffectiveness of its behavioral\nprograms, relies on physical and chemical restraints to control\nresidents' behavior.  For example, 119 of NTWDC's 150 residents\nare on neuroleptics for behavioral control.  There is no evidence\nthat NTWDC staff are attempting to integrate behavioral and\npsychopharmacological treatments and there was no one at NTWDC at\nthe time of our tours sufficiently trained in the interactive\neffects of these different treatment modalities.  As noted\nearlier, the absence of reliable data further prevents facility\nprofessionals from having sufficient knowledge about a resident's\nbehavior to develop a program that appropriately interrelates\nmedication and non-medication therapies.\nGiven the large number of residents at NTWDC with\nself-injurious or aggressive behaviors, NTWDCs failure to\nadequately address these behaviors is resulting in actual\nphysical harm to residents.  For example, NTWDC's own staff\n\n- 4 -\nhave documented hundreds of incidents occurring at the facility,\nmany of them serious behavior-related injuries to residents.\nExamples of injuries suffered by NTWDC residents include multiple\nbites, lacerations, broken bones, bruises and abrasions.  One\nindividual was injured 25 times, receiving lacerations 11 times,\nincluding one six inches long, in an eight-month period.  Of 25\ninjuries another individual received in an eight-month period, 16\nwere self-inflicted and others resulted from fights with other\nresidents.  Several residents were found attempting to cut\nthemselves with knives or razorblades.\nFurther, NTWDCs program for teaching residents new skills\nalso fails to provide the training necessary for the health,\nsafety and independence of the residents.  For example, the\ncurrent practice at NTWDC is geared toward residents reaching an\narbitrary level of skill performance rather than teaching skills\nin a manner that would actually benefit a resident in living in\nthe community.\nWe also identified inappropriate restraint practices at\nNTWDC.  For example, some of the physical handling techniques\nemployed by NTWDC, including the straight-arm maneuver, pose risk\nof injury to residents.  Indeed, we examined the record of one\nresident who suffered a dislocated elbow after a take-down\nprocedure.  Although NTWDC may file an incident report for\ninjuries occurring during the use of restraint, each such injury\nis not investigated as thoroughly as it should be investigated.\nAlthough we were informed that the use of time-out rooms will be\ndiscontinued, the rooms must be padded to prevent injury to\nresidents during any continued use.  Significantly, the facility\nalso places residents face-down in the prone position while in\nrestraint.  This is an especially dangerous practice which we\nrequested be terminated immediately at the time of our tour.\nFurther, the facility does not adequately monitor its restraint\npractices.\nIn summary, NTWDCs practices in providing behavioral\ntreatment and skill acquisition for its residents are seriously\ninadequate and violate the residents' constitutional and\nstatutory rights.\nII.  Medical and Psychiatric Care at NTWDC is Deficient Due,\nIn Large Part, to an Inadequate Number of Trained Medical\nStaff.\nDuring our investigation of NTWDC, we found that medical\nstaff personnel at the facility lack sufficient training and\nknowledge to provide adequate medical and psychiatric care to\nNTWDC residents.  Our review of the qualifications of NTWDC\nmedical staff demonstrated that the physicians lack training in\ntreating persons with developmental disabilities and likewise\n\n- 5 -\nlacked expertise in psychopharmacology and neurology, critical\ndeficits considering the resident population at NTWDC.\nFurther, we also identified numerous deficiencies in the\nmedical services provided by the Medical Officer(s) on Duty\n(MOD).  For example, we identified instances where MODs would\norder the hospitalization of a resident without ever seeing or\nexamining the resident.  NTWDC staff also told us that they often\nhad difficulty locating a physician to attend to the needs of\nresidents.  Further, the facility also does not have an adequate\nmedical quality management or physician peer review system in\nplace.\nWe also identified the need for NTWDC to increase its\nability to respond to emergency medical care needs.  With regard\nto emergency medical care, we identified deficiencies in the\ntraining being provided NTWDC staff and undue delays in accessing\nemergency medical supplies.  In addition, necessary documentation\nof residents' medical status was lacking; medical staff often\nfailed to note critical changes in residents' medical status.\nDespite the fact that NTWDC is used by the State of\nTennessee as a facility for treating persons with a dual\ndiagnosis i.e., mental retardation and a psychiatric illness or\ndisorder, there is no consistent psychiatric service provider at\nthe facility.  Psychiatric services are provided sporadically at\nbest by physicians who have no formal training in the unique\nproblems associated in treating persons with dual diagnosis.  Our\nmedical consultant concluded that a full-time psychiatrist with\nexperience in mental retardation is \"urgently needed\" at NTWDC.\nThe vast majority of residents at NTWDC receive some type of\npsychotropic medications.  Further, medications are often\nadministered in unjustifiable combinations or dosage levels, are\nnot adequately monitored, and are administered without sufficient\ntarget behaviors or specific goals identified.  More intensive\npsychiatric care is required for the residents of NTWDC.\nTherefore, we conclude that medical services at NTWDC,\nincluding basic and emergency medical care and psychiatric\nservices, do not meet accepted professional standards.\nIII.  Numerous Environmental Health and Fire Safety Deficiencies\nat NTWDC Pose Risks to Residents.\nDuring our investigation, we identified numerous\nenvironmental health and safety deficiencies that expose\nresidents and staff to health and safety risks.  Many of the\ndeficiencies were related to NTWDCs food service and preparation\noperations.\nSanitary conditions were very poor at the food facility.\n(Food for NTWDC is prepared in the same kitchen that prepares\n\n- 6 -\nfood for the Western Mental Health Institute.)  For example, we\nnoted water leakage throughout the facility and some of the\nleaking water was contaminating food service equipment.  Mold and\nmildew were prevalent throughout the refrigerators and coolers\nand peeling paint was noted in various areas.  Food and utensils\nwere also being improperly stored and there was mice infestation\nin dry food storage areas.  Further, dishwashers were not working\nproperly and we found dirty cookware, even though the items were\nsupposedly clean.  In general, the food service area was in poor\nrepair.\nWe also noted that food was not served to residents at\nproper temperatures.  Once food is prepared in the kitchen area,\nit is then transported to resident living areas.  This process\nleads to undue delays in servicing the food, which allows the\nfood to cool and exposes it to contamination.  NTWDC must improve\nits food service practices.\nWe also identified other hazardous conditions such as\nimproper plumbing configurations which could expose the drinking\nwater to contamination.  In one bathroom, the water ran an orange\ncolor from a sink for approximately one minute, suggesting some\ntype of contamination which must be investigated.\nNTWDC must revise and formalize its fire evacuation plans.\nNumerous inconsistencies and other problems were identified when\nwe reviewed the evacuation plan provided us.  Further, staff we\nspoke with had not been adequately trained on fire safety\nprocedures, notably the proper use of fire extinguishers.  We\nalso noted that several doors necessary for fire and smoke\nseparation were not properly maintained.  Some of the emergency\nlights were not working and, at least in one case, there was an\nopening in the wall above a ceiling through which smoke could\ninvade an adjacent hallway.  Our expert was also concerned about\nthe conditions of the emergency generator and whether adequate\nmaintenance was being performed.  In sum, a thorough fire safety\nreview must be performed at NTWDC and identified deficiencies\nimmediately corrected.\nWe also identified other conditions that pose risk to\nresidents.  For example, there were many cords hanging from\nblinds in residents' room and bureaus contained horizontal bars.\nThese are especially dangerous considering the nature of the\nNTWDC resident population.\nIn sum, the deficiencies in the adequacy of sanitation and\nlife and health safety conditions at NTWDC expose residents to\nundue risks to their health and safety.\n\n- 7 -\nIV.  NTWDC's Institutional Environment Fails to Meet the Needs of\nthe Residents.\nIn providing care and services to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, it is essential to furnish them with\nan acceptable and responsive environment that ensures safety and\npromotes learning, development, and their overall well-being.\nSuch environments must be functional and serve to enhance the\nquality of life for the individuals.  Currently accepted\nprofessional standards require that this environment be the least\nseparate, most integrated setting where the individuals' needs\ncan be met.  It must be safe, stable, and operate to teach and\nmaintain functional skills, to reduce or pre-empt the occurrence\nof behavior problems, and otherwise promote the independent\nfunctioning of the individual.  NTWDC does not meet these\nrequirements.  The failure to provide adequate services at NTWDC\nmay, in fact, be resulting in the inability of residents to\ndevelop those skills necessary for them to live outside the\ninstitution.  This is simply unacceptable.\nThe State must provide these residents with disabilities an\nopportunity to participate in or benefit from services equal to\nthose afforded to others outside the institution; more\nspecifically, to those provided to other individuals with\ndisabilities in the State's established community-based programs.\nBy confining residents with disabilities at NTWDC, the State has\nfailed to provide such services in the least separate, most\nintegrated setting as required by the Americans with Disabilities\nAct of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seg., and section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\nV.  Remedial Measures.\nIn order to remedy the deficiencies identified herein and\nensure that the rights of NTWDC residents are protected, the\nfollowing remedial measures must be implemented promptly:\na.  NTWDC must employ and deploy sufficient numbers of\ncompetent and trained professional and direct care staff,\nincluding psychologists, to ensure residents are supervised and\nadequately protected from harm and provided appropriate training\nand other services.\nb.  Restraint procedures used at NTWDC must be revaluated\nimmediately.  The practice of prone restraint must be terminated\nto avoid resident injuries and death by choking or asphyxiation\nand use of the straight-arm maneuver should also be prohibited\nimmediately in light of the past injury.  All injuries related to\nthe use of restraints must be fully investigated.  While in use,\ntime-out rooms must be padded to protect residents placed in time\nout.  All NTWDC residents must be medically cleared before\nhands-on procedures to restrain them are used.\n\n- 8 -\nc.  All residents must be evaluated to determine their\nindividual strengths and weaknesses and to develop appropriate\nindividualized training programs, including behavior management\nand skill acquisition programs.  Immediate attention must be\ngiven to residents with self-injurious, physically abusive and\nother destructive behaviors by identifying them and providing\nnecessary training on a priority basis.  One-to-one staffing must\nbe provided immediately for residents who are at risk of serious\ninjury, including injuries from aggression and pica.\nd.  All interdisciplinary teams in conducting evaluations\nshould review the individual's training needs, utilizing a\nfunctional analysis for those individuals with problem behaviors,\nand emphasizing alternatives to restraints.  Programs should\naddress and develop appropriate strategies to promote the\nphysical, mental, behavioral, and social skills of each resident\nand permit each resident to function as independently as\npossible.  Such programs must be consistently implemented and\nappropriately reviewed and revised.  Emphasis should also be\nplaced on teaching residents to acquire the skills necessary for\nthem to live in community settings.\ne.  As part of the provision of appropriate programs, NTWDC\nmust develop and implement a professionally designed,\nindividually appropriate, data collection system to measure\nrelevant information about problem behaviors and the conditions\nunder which they occur, including, where appropriate, the\nfrequency, intensity, and duration of the behaviors.  NTWDC must\nimplement an appropriate data collection system to ensure that\nadaptive and functional skills training is meeting the needs of\nthe resident involved.  Furthermore, NTWDC must review and\nrespond to the data collected relating to both behavior programs\nand skill acquisition programs in a timely and appropriate\nmanner.\nf.  Measures must be taken to improve the adaptive skills\ntraining provided to NTWDC residents, including that for\ncommunication and language skills.  Similarly, NTWDC must assess\neach resident's need for adaptive devices, including\ncommunication devices, and provide them to those individuals in\nneed of them.\ng.  NTWDC must hire, train and deploy adequate numbers of\ncompetent and qualified medical care staff, including physicians\nand nurses, to meet the medical needs of the residents.  NTWDC\nmust provide enhanced training opportunities to the present\nphysician staff to teach them skills necessary to care for\ndevelopmentally disabled persons.  NTWDC must increase the number\nof hours of consulting and contract professionals to a level\nsufficient to provide adequate care.  NTWDC must ensure that\nenough adequately trained medical professionals are employed to\ninstitute appropriate quality assurance mechanisms, especially to\n\n- 9 -\noversee the prescription, administration, and monitoring of\npsychotropic and anticonvulsant medications, and to provide\ntimely prevention, treatment and follow-up of medical problems.\nPolicies and protocols to guide professional decisions must be\ndeveloped.\nh.  NTWDC must immediately hire at least one full-time\npsychiatrist with experience and training in dual diagnosis.\ni.  NTWDC must provide adequate and timely medical care,\nincluding appropriate services to meet the acute, chronic and\nemergency medical care needs of residents.  NTWDC must ensure\nthat physicians are immediately available to NTWDC residents at\nnight and on weekends.  NTWDC must develop and implement\nprocedures and protocols for tracking sentinel health events and\nmanaging acute and chronic illnesses.\nj.  Residents on psychotropic and anticonvulsant medications\nmust be evaluated to determine the appropriateness of their\nprescriptions and whether these medications are being prescribed\nand monitored in accordance with accepted professional standards.\nPsychotropic medications must not be used without an adequate\nrationale and a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric diagnosis, nor as\npunishment, in lieu of a training program for behavior control,\nor for the convenience of staff.\nk.  Medical records must be kept in a fashion sufficient to\nallow medical professionals to provide adequate and timely care.\n1.  An overall plan to assess the need for continued\ninstitutionalization of each resident and to place residents in\nappropriate, less restrictive, community-based programs must be\ndeveloped and implemented.  In the meantime, residents should\nreceive training to assist in their placement and transition to\ncommunity-based living arrangements.  Residents should also be\nadequately assessed to identify services necessary to meet their\nneeds in the community.  NTWDC staff must take a greater role in\nhelping to ensure that residents' placements into the community\nare appropriate and successful.\n\n- 10 -\nStaff from my office will be contacting representatives\nfrom the Attorney General's office soon to negotiate a judicially\nenforceable settlement to correct deficiencies at NTWDC, as well\nas those identified at Clover Bottom and Greene Valley\nDevelopmental Centers.\nSincerely,\nDeval L.
