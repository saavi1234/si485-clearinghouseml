    "summary": "<p>In 1980, a intellectually disabled resident of the Southside Virginia Training Center (\"Southside\") filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of himself and 98 other Southside residents with intellectual disabilities who desired community placement.  Plaintiffs, represented by the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society and the Peninsula Legal Aid Center, sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the defendants, who included Southside employees, officials with the City of Richmond, state mental health and public welfare agencies, and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, to provide them with community residential placements and social, educational and rehabilitative programs.</p><p>The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on August 17, 1981, asserting claims under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.; the Rehabilitation Act  of 1973, § 504, as amended, 29 U.S.C.§ 794; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for due process, equal protection, and cruel and unusual punishment clause violations; and Virginia state law.  The Plaintiff claimed that Southside did not adequately prepare its residents with the necessary social and life skills for them to transition into the community and that defendants failed to provide appropriate residential placement programs for them. </p><p>On July 24, 1980, the plaintiff filed a motion for class certification; at this early stage in the litigation, plaintiff was seeking to certify a class of all mentally disabled persons in \"The catchment area of Southside Virginia Training Center, including those held at Southside Virginia Training Center.\"  This claimed class consisted of over 5,000 mentally disabled Virginians. The plaintiffs also tried to establish a defendant class: \"all communities and their officials who charged with any duties and obligations with respect to mentally [disabled] persons  in the defendant communities served by Southside.\" In September of 1980, Defendants all moved to dismiss the plaintiff's amended complaint, and the case continued to proceed through discovery.  </p><p>On August 12, 1981, plaintiff and the federal Department of Health and Human Services filed a consent decree, which stipulated the conditions for the dismissal of the department from the case.  In the decree, the Department agreed to investigate Southside and issue a Findings Letter to the plaintiffs within six months of the order. </p><p>Litigation with the state defendants continued. On August 17, 1981, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. Though the Clearinghouse does not have a copy of this complaint, later opinions indicate that this complaint lessened the class from all mentally disabled persons in the catchment of Southside to only those residing within Southside</p><p>On November 17, 1981, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss.  In their motions to dismiss, defendants asserted that plaintiffs must bring their claims through a petition of habeas corpus, and must therefore have exhausted state remedies before a suit could be brought.  The court asserted that this was a mischaracterization of the plaintiffs' claims; the plaintiffs were seeking treatment, habilitation, and an opportunity to be in the community, not simply release.  </p><p>The court also interpreted Virginia state law as requiring placement in the least restrictive environment possible, as well as requiring social and residential services that were not offered to the residents of Southside.  The court also sided with the plaintiffs in their assertion that Southside was discriminating against them in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.  Although the court was less convinced that a due process right to treatment existed for the plaintiffs, it noted that the dismissal of the claim would be \"improper.\" 526 F. Supp 985 (1981).</p><p>On February 25, 1982, class certification for both the plaintiff and defendant class was denied.  On August 25, 1982 the defendants moved for summary judgment, and on September 17, 1982, the plaintiff amended his complaint, adding one more private party and removing the request for class certification.  </p><p>On April 25, 1983, the parties filed a stipulation and order of dismissal. The content of the stipulation is unknown, but the court dismissed the case on the same day, April 25, 1983.</p><p></p>",

Defendant Patricia Harris is the Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.  As such she is charged with \ncarrying out the obligation under 42  USC  §6010  ( 3) (a)  that no facility for \nthe mentally retarded service federal funds  unless it provides appropriate \nservices. \n:mcrs \n14.  Plaintiff William Davis  is 40  years old. \nI \n15.  Plaintiff is rroderately mentally retarded and,  because of para-\n1 \nparesis, walks with orthopedic shoes and a  walker. \n16.  Plaintiff was admitted to Lynchburg Training School on Septerrber \n16,  1953. \n-3-\n\n'l \n17.  Plaintiff  was transferred from Lynchburg to Southside Virginia \nTraining Center on March 19,  1980. \n18.  All of the time th3.t plaintiff has been in Lynchburg and Southside \nVirginia Training Center,  such placerrent has been inar:propriate for him. \n11  19.  Plaintiff is not,  and has not since his admission to Lynchburg, \nreceived  appropriate treatment,  care or habilitation. \nII  20.  Plaintiff's confinement in Lynchburg and Southside Virginia \nTraining Center without appropriate treatment and care has caused substantial \ni.npainnent in his ability to function and to learn and has caused him grave \nsuffering,  pain,  and hardship. \n21.  Plaintiff is in need of oonmunity placenent within the City of \nRichrrond.  He  is in need of appropriate habilitation services and treatment \nto accorrpany that oonmunity placerrent. \n22.  Although defendants'  acknc:Mledge  that plaintiff is in need of \ncommunity placenent and treatment,  and that he has been in need of such place-\nment and treatrrent for a  substantial time,  defendants have failed,  and \ncontinue to fail,  to provide him with conmunity placenent and appropriate \ntreatment in the oornnunity. \n23.  While confinerrent at Southside Virginia Training Center and the \nprograms available to plaintiff at Southside Virginia Training Center are all \ninappropriate to his needs,  the program which rrost ar:proaches being appro-\npriate to his needs  is the vocational training  program.  Plaintiff has been and \nII \nis being excluded from that program because he is handicapped and needs to \nwalk with a  walker and that program is inaccessible to handicar:ped individuals. \n24.  While plaintiff is said to be receiving several types of progranrning \nwhile he is at Southside Virginia Training Center, plaintiff in fact is \nreceiving no appropriate prograrrming and nothing that can honestly be  referred \nto as  \"treatment\" of any kind. \nCLAIM:>  FDR RELIEF \n25.  Defendants Jean Harris' ,  Kirven's and Buckley's isolation and \nsegregation of plaintiff by confining him to Southside Virginia Training \nCenter without offering him anything approaching appropriate treatment or \nhabilitation is an unwarranted restriction on plaintiff's liberty.  'Ihis \nrestriction,  isolation,  and segregation of plaintiff constitutes cruel and \n-4-\n\nII \nII \nunusual. punishment,  in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Arrendments  to \nthe United States Constitution,  42  USC  §1983 and 42 USC  §6010 (2). \nSecond Claim \n26.  By isolating and segregating plaintiff fran interaction with any but \nother rrentally retarded citizens, by housing  only  rrentally retarded citizens \nin Southside Virginia Training Center, by segregating plaintiff from other \nhandicapped and nonhandicapped individuals within the conmunit y and by \ndenying plaint iff access to services and opportunities,  including recreational \nfacilities and transportation facilities,  available to others in the \nccmnunity who  are not mentally retarded,  defendants Jean Harris,  Kirven,  and \nBuckley have violated and continue to violate plaintiff 1 s  right to be free  · \nfrom discrimination on the basis of his handicap,  as guaranteed by the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution,  29  USC  §794,  and 42  USC  §1983. \n'!bird Claim \nII \n27.  By denying plaintiff access to the only program at Southside \nVirginia Training Center which even approaches a  suitable program for plain-\ntiff because of plaintiff's physical handicap,  defendants Jean Harris, \nKirven and Buckley have violated and continue to violate plaintiff's right to \nbe free from discrimination on the basis of his handicap as guaranteed by \n29  usc §794 and 42  usc §1983. \nFourth Claim \n28.  Defendants'  confinement of plaintiff in Southside Virginia \nTraining Center and the failure of all defendants to provide housing for and \nto treat and properly care for plaintiff in a  oamrnunity setting violates \nplaintiff's  right to be provided treatment in the least restrictive alterna-\nt ive as guaranteed by 42  USC  §6010 (2)  and Virginia Code §37 .1- 84.1(6). \nFifth Claim \n29.  All defendants 1  failure to provide appropriate treatrnent,  social \nservices,  and habilitation which is appropriate to plaintiff's needs violates \nplaintiff's right to appropriate treatment as guaranteed by 42  USC  §6010(1) \nand  (3). \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFDRE,  plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court assume \njurisdiction over this matter and grant the follaving relief: \n-5-\n\n1.  declare that defendants '  actions and failures or refusals to act \nhave violated and continue to violate plaintiff's constitutional and statuto.ry \nrights as alleged; \n2.  enjoin defendants  from failing to provide plaintiff wit lt  appropriate \ncomnunity placem:mt and appropriate social services,  rehabilitation services, \nand treatment and habqlitation services in the least restrictive alternative; \n3.  Award compensato.ry darna.ges  to plaintiff against defendants Jean \nHarris, Kirven and Buckley jointly and severly in the anount of $20 ,000;  and \n4.

Bruce.\nMEMORANDUM\nMERHIGE, District Judge.\nThis is an action by two named plaintiffs brought on behalf of the class (not yet certified) of all mentally retarded\nresidents of Southside Virginia Training Center (\"Southside\") who are ready for community placement, seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief requiring the defendants to provide them with residential placements and social,\neducational and rehabilitative programs in their communities.\nIn their second amended complaint, filed on August 17, 1981 pursuant to the Court's order of that date, plaintiffs\nrest their claims to relief on Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., the due process and\nequal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, § 504, as amended, 29\nU.S.C. § 794, Va.Code § 37.1-84.1 and Va. Code § 37.1-98.\nThe class of plaintiffs is said to be composed of those 98 persons currently housed in Southside who have been\nidentified as ready for release into the community.\nNamed defendants include several state officials associated with Virginia's mental health and public welfare\nagencies, the Governor of Virginia, and mental health and welfare officials of the City of Richmond. The\nRichmond officials are sued as representatives of an asserted class of defendants which includes all\ncommunities and their officials charged with any duties and obligations with respect to mentally retarded persons\nin the various communities served by Southside.\nPlaintiffs claim that none of these communities has developed appropriate residential placement or educational,\nvocational, habilitation and other programs for members of the plaintiff class. Plaintiffs also assert that they are\nnot provided adequate preparation for release at Southside, and that the personnel, therapy, recreational, self-\nhelp and social skills training programs, medical and dental care, as well as the facilities at Southside are\ndefective and inadequate.\n988\n\n[1]\n*988 The present motions to dismiss by several defendants  are brought on a number of grounds, which fall\nwithin two general categories:\n(1) substantive arguments\n(2) lack of authority arguments.\nFor the reasons which follow, the Court is of the view that the motions must be denied.\nI. Substantive Arguments\nA. Habeas Corpus Argument:\nDefendants contend that plaintiffs' claim is one seeking release from custody and placement in the community,\nand, as a challenge to the fact or duration of their confinement, must be brought only through a petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). In a habeas\naction, plaintiffs would be required to exhaust their state remedies before bringing this action.\nIn the Court's view, however, defendants mischaracterize plaintiffs' claims and the nature of the relief sought. The\n[2]\nessence of plaintiffs' claims is not that they are being \"unlawfully subjected to physical restraint,\"  but that the\nConstitution and federal and state law entitle them to certain levels of treatment and habilitation. The declaratory\nand injunctive relief sought in order to require defendants to provide such treatment, one phase of which includes\nappropriate residential placements, goes well beyond the release from physical custody sought in a habeas\naction. The injunctive relief ordered in similar suits by retarded or mentally ill citizens against state officials has\nbeen extensive, and has included orders concerning staffing, individualized treatment programs, recreation and\ninstitutional organization. See Welsch v. Likins, 373 F.Supp. 487 (D.Minn.1974),aff'd. in part and vacated in part,\n550 F.2d 1122 (8th Cir. 1977); Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781 (D.Ala.1971),aff'd.503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.\n1974); New York Ass'n for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Rockefeller, 357 F.Supp. 752, 757 (E.D.N.Y.1973). If any\ncomparison is to be drawn between a prisoner suit and the instant action, it is certainly closer to a suit\nchallenging the conditions of confinement than to a habeas action. Such challenges are proper subjects of a §\n1983 action. Derrow v. Shields, 482 F.Supp. 1144 (W.D.Va. 1980). See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94\nS.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).\nB. The State Law Claims:\nPlaintiffs claim that the defendants' failure to provide community placements and rehabilitative programs\nconstitutes a violation of Va.Code § 37.1-84.1, which requires that patients or residents in facilities operated,\nfunded or licensed by the state's Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation be treated \"under the least\nrestrictive conditions consistent with [their] condition and not be subjected to unnecessary physical restraint or\nisolation.\"\nDefendants argue that this statute does not give rise to the entitlements claimed by the plaintiffs.\nThe content of the duties imposed on state officials by § 37.1-84.1 is not clear. It seems reasonable to suggest\nthat the \"least restrictive alternative\" would require community placements where warranted. The Department of\nMental Health and Mental Retardation has declared its commitment to the \"development of a comprehensive\n989 continuation of services which will provide viable alternatives to institutionalization for *989 Virginia's mentally\n[3]\nretarded citizens and their families,\" with emphasis on \"community-based alternatives to institutionalization.\"\nAlso, § 37.1-84.1(1) provides that the patient retains his legal rights under federal laws, which may require the\nremedies plaintiffs seek. Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim is not well taken.\nDefendants also argue that, before bringing this action, plaintiffs must first exhaust their remedies before the\nhuman rights committee at their institution. The Court sees little merit in this position. Defendants present no\n\nauthority for this assertion and there is no indication that pursuit of such procedure would be effective in\nachieving the relief plaintiffs seek.\nPlaintiffs also claim that defendants have failed to provide the appropriate residential and social services required\nby Va.Code § 37.1-98. That section provides that the director of a state hospital may discharge a patient who is\nnot a proper case for treatment in the institution, and calls for provision of \"social services\" to discharged persons\nby local public welfare agencies. The content of these services is not well defined. Defendants maintain that they\nare limited to whatever programs are currently provided to those discharged. This is an insufficient ground for\ndismissal. Plaintiffs in this action seek a declaration as to what placement and rehabilitative programs are\nrequired by the Constitution and other federal laws. Such programs would certainly be part of the pre-discharge\nplan and post-discharge care mandated by § 37.1-98.\nC. The Rehabilitation Act:\nPlaintiffs claim that defendants have failed to comply with the prohibition of discrimination by reason of a\nhandicap in any program receiving federal financial assistance, found in § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794, by segregating plaintiffs from contact with any but other mentally retarded citizens and denying them\naccess to services and opportunities available to the non-handicapped.\nDefendants contend that this claim is barred by plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. The\nCourt disagrees with this argument.\nThe regulations under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 45 C.F.R. § 84.61, adopt the enforcement procedures of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, found in 45 C.F.R. §§ 80.6-90.10. The same procedures apply to\nproceedings brought to enforce § 901(a) of Title IX, which prohibits discrimination in any education program\nreceiving federal aid. 45 C.F.R. § 86.71.\nDefendants' argument that exhaustion of administrative remedies is required of a private litigant before he may\nseek judicial relief under the Rehabilitation Act holds little weight after the Supreme Court's decision in Cannon v.\nUniversity of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). There, the Court held that a private\nright of action impliedly existed under Title IX. It further concluded that exhaustion of administrative remedies was\nnot a prerequisite to the bringing of such a suit. 441 U.S. at 706-08 n.41, 99 S.Ct. at 1962-63 n.41. Subsequent\ncourt decisions have applied this rule to private actions under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, where the\nenforcement regulations are the same. Kling v. County of Los Angeles, 633 F.2d 876 (9th Cir. 1980); Camenisch\nv. University of Texas, 616 F.2d 127 (5th Cir. 1980),vacated in other respects,451 U.S. 390, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68\nL.Ed.2d 175 (1981); Medley v. Ginsberg, 492 F.Supp. 1294 (S.D.W.Va.1980). The rationale behind this rule, as\nstated by the Camenisch court, is as follows:\nIt is clear why the Supreme Court reached the result it did in Cannon. The administrative\nenforcement process, established by Congress as a part of Title VI, centers entirely on the\n990 question of whether, in light of the policies and practices of a recipient of federal assistance, *990\nfederal funds should continue to flow to that recipient. It is predicated upon the need by the\nSecretary to monitor and enforce the nondiscrimination provisions of agreements between HEW\nand the recipients of federal assistance. See 45 C.F.R. §§ 80.8-80.9 (1979). The purpose of the\nadministrative framework is to provide a forum in which to initiate fund termination proceedings in\nthe event a grant recipient fails to meet its obligations. It is not intended to provide a forum for\nprogram beneficiaries to press claims of discrimination against grant recipients. See 45 C.F.R. §§\n80.8(a), 80.10(f) (1979).\nThe remedy that emerges from such a hearing process is not designed to aid petitioners like\nCamenisch at all. A decision to terminate funding of a non-complying recipient could work to the\ndisadvantage of a complainant like Camenisch since such a cut-off could guarantee that no further\nservices accrue to the complaining party. There is no specific vindication of personal rights within\nthe HEW administrative procedure for complaining parties like Camenisch.\n\n616 F.2d at 135.\nThe Court thus concludes that plaintiffs need not invoke the administrative enforcement procedures before\nbringing this action.\nD. Constitutional Claims:\nPlaintiffs claim that defendants have violated their rights to habilitation under the due process clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. They also assert that their segregation from other non-handicapped individuals and lack\nof access to services and facilities available to those who are not mentally retarded amount to a denial of their\nequal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn the instant motion defendants make no effort to dismiss plaintiffs' equal protection claim. They do assert,\nhowever, that there is no constitutional right to treatment in favor of those confined in institutions for the mentally\nretarded.\nNeither the existence of nor the content of a constitutional right to treatment premised on the due process clause\nis well established. The courts which have found such a right have reasoned that there must be some quid pro\nquo in the form of rehabilitative treatment provided by the state to justify the massive curtailment of individual\nliberty which accompanies an involuntary civil commitment. Otherwise, the confinement constitutes a denial of\ndue process. This right to treatment thus springs from the deprivation of liberty caused by the commitment. \nRomeo v. Youngberg, 644 F.2d 147 (3rd Cir. 1980),cert. granted, 451 U.S. 982, 101 S.Ct. 2313, 68 L.Ed.2d 838\n(1981) (right to habilitation on behalf of the mentally retarded arises when the individual is involuntarily\ncommitted, regardless of whether on parens patria need for treatment grounds or police power grounds); Wyatt v.\nAderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974) (civilly committed mental patients have constitutional right to rehabilitative\ntreatment); Eckerhart v. Hensley, 475 F.Supp. 908 (W.D.Mo.1979) (those involuntarily placed in civil commitment\nhave right to such treatment as will give them a reasonable opportunity to be cured or improve their mental\ncondition); Rone v. Fireman, 473 F.Supp. 92 (N.D.Ohio 1979) (person involuntarily committed either in whole or in\npart for the purpose of treatment has due process right to treatment); Gary W. v. State of Louisiana, 437 F.Supp.\n1209 (E.D. La.1976) (right to the treatment required to achieve the purpose of confinement); Welsch v. Likins,\n373 F.Supp. 487 (D.Minn. 1974),aff'd. in part and vacated in part,550 F.2d 1122 (8th Cir. 1977).\nIn O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975), the Supreme Court declined to\ndecide whether a mentally ill person dangerous to himself or to others has a right to treatment when compulsorily\nconfined by a state, or whether a state may require confinement of a nondangerous, mentally ill person for\npurpose of treatment. The Court did state that a mere finding that an individual is mentally ill does not justify\n991 indefinite custodial *991 confinement, and held that \"a State cannot constitutionally confine without more a\nnondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and\nresponsible family members or friends.\" 422 U.S. at 576, 95 S.Ct. at 2494.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has noted in dicta, while finding it unnecessary to express an opinion\non the issue of treatment in civil commitment cases:\n[W]e note our fundamental disagreement with the approach taken by the district court in Burnham\n[v. Dept. of Public Health of the State of Georgia, 349 F.Supp. 1335 (N.D.Ga.1972),rev'd.503\nF.2d 1319 (5th Cir. 1974), a case which had rejected a constitutionally based right to treatment in\nthe civil commitment setting]. Although courts are ill-equipped to prescribe the techniques of\ntreatment, that does not alter the fact that in many cases treatment is obviously called for and is\navailable in some form. In such cases, the state cannot arbitrarily refuse to provide relief.\nBowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44 at 48 n.3.\nAt any rate, this complex issue is not suitable for resolution on the record currently before the Court. It is sufficient\nfor present purposes to say, as did the court in Scott v. Plante, 532 F.2d 939 (3rd Cir. 1976), that it does not\n\nappear to a certainty that plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief on their right to treatment claim under a state of\nfacts they could prove in support of that claim, and dismissal is improper.\nII. Lack of Authority Argument\nA. Defendants Lukhard and Pendleton:\nPendleton initially argues that he is no longer the chairman of the Virginia State Board of Welfare and should be\ndismissed. Under F.R.C.P. Rule 25(d)(1), Pendleton's successor, Albert Bailey, is automatically substituted as a\n[4]\ndefendant in place of Pendleton.\nBoth Pendleton and Lukhard, the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Welfare, argue that the plaintiffs\nfail to state a claim against them because they have no authority to make determinations regarding whether\nindividuals should be institutionalized or the operation of the institutions.\nPlaintiffs respond that these defendants' lack of authority over institutionalization and discharge decisions, and\nover the operation of the institutions, does not relieve them of all responsibility for providing the services and\nfacilities which would allow plaintiffs community placement where appropriate and provide them with rehabilitative\nprograms in their communities. The Court agrees.\nThe present lack of these services and facilities may be as much the result of omissions on the part of these\nwelfare officials as of those of the State Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. If plaintiffs\neventually prevail on any of their claims, the relief they seek could not be completely provided without the\nparticipation of the welfare agencies. The September, 1979 report on Deinstitutionalization and Community\nServices of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee of the Virginia General Assembly has recognized\nthe need for coordination between the network of agencies with formally defined mental health and mental\nretardation responsibilities and the group of human service agencies, such as the Department of Welfare, in\norder to ensure that these persons receive the full range of necessary services. Id. at 14. Interagency cooperative\nservice agreements were signed by the Board of Welfare and the Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation in 1976 and 1979 to delineate their respective responsibilities to persons discharged from state\ninstitutions. These defendants' motions to dismiss must be denied.\n992  B. Defendant Hogan:\n*992\nHogan is the Director of Public Welfare for the City of Richmond. He argues that the extent of his agency's\nresponsibility to any of the plaintiff class is set out in Va. Code § 37.1-98, which makes the provision of social\nservices to patients discharged from state hospitals the duty of local welfare agencies such as Hogan's, as\ndetermined by policy approved by the State Board of Welfare. Hogan maintains that under the policy approved by\nthe State Board, his agency has responsibility only to patients who have been discharged and that the policy\ndoes not require the provision of any special services to the handicapped.\nThe Court is of the view that dismissal of Hogan on these grounds would be inappropriate. The cooperative\nservices agreements between the Department of Welfare and the Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation have called for participation by local welfare agencies in admissions, discharges and pre-discharge\nplanning for patients in state hospitals. The relief plaintiffs seek would not be complete without such participation.\nC. Defendant Hellmut:\nHellmut is the Chairman of the Richmond Advisory Board of Public Welfare. He argues that he has \"no authority\nor responsibility in respect to the allegations of [the] complaint.\"\nSection 25.3 of the Richmond City Code, implementing the obligations imposed by Va.Code § 63.1-43.1 on local\nwelfare boards, provides that the Advisory Board is to\n\ninterest itself in all matters pertaining to the social welfare of the people of the city served by it,\nshall monitor the formulation and implementation of social welfare programs in the city, shall make\nrecommendations on policy matters concerning the department or division, shall make an annual\nreport to the governing body, concurrent with the budget presentation of the department or\ndivision, concerning the administration of the public welfare program, [and] may submit to the\ngoverning body, from time to time, other reports that the advisory body deems appropriate, ...\nClearly, this means that Hellmut and his Board must participate in the development of community placement\nplans and of services provided those discharged from state hospitals, if plaintiffs eventually prevail on any of their\nclaims. Otherwise, the Board serves no useful function whatsoever. Hellmut's motion to dismiss will be denied.\nD. Defendants City of Richmond, Foley and Bruce:\nFoley is the Director of the Richmond Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Bruce is the\nChairman of the Richmond Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services Board. These defendants\ncite Va.Code § 37.1-194, which allows the state to make matching grants to cities that establish mental health,\nmental retardation and substance abuse programs and provides that the State Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation Board is to determine a core of program services to be provided by local boards by July 2, 1982, and\nargue that they have yet to receive this program. Defendants contend simply that they have done all they can on\ntheir own to provide such services and therefore should be dismissed. This is no ground for dismissal. The city's\nDepartment of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services Board bears the responsibilities under the City\nCode to develop and provide services for the mentally ill and retarded, as well as residential facilities for them.\nThe fact that these defendants do not presently provide the facilities and services to which plaintiffs claim they\nare entitled under federal law does not justify their dismissal from an action seeking to obtain these services.\n[1] The defendants involved in these motions are: William F. Lukhard, Commissioner of the Virginia Department\nof Welfare; Eugene B. Pendleton, Jr., Chairman of the Virginia State Board of Welfare; Thomas W. Hogan,\nDirector of Public Welfare for the City of Richmond; Margaret Foley, Director of the Richmond City Department of\nMental Health and Mental Retardation and Executive Director of the Richmond Community Mental Health and\nMental Retardation Services Board; William F. Hellmut, Chairman of the Richmond Advisory Board of Public\nWelfare; Donald K. Bruce, Chairman of the Richmond Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation\nServices Board; and the City of Richmond.\n[2]Preiser v.

The  class of defendants is so numerous that joinder is inappropriate. \nThere are questions of law in fact comron to the class.  These include the \nduties awed by defendants to plaintiffs under various  federal,  state laws, \nand the degree to whidl programs of the oonmunit ies and institutions satisfy \nthese duties. \nII  24.  Defendant City of Richrrond and its officials have acted in a  fashion \ntypical of that of the class :defendants  in failing to provide sufficient \nI \nappropriate carrnnunit y placement and treatment.  Moreover,  the City of Richrrond \nas the largest oommunit y in the area served by Southside Virginia Training \nCenter should be able to properly, adequately  and fairly represent the \ninterests of the class. \nFACI'UAL ALLEGATIONS  APPLICABLE 'ID THE  CLAS~ \n25.  'Ihe Southside Virginia Training Center receives both state and \nfederal funds  for treatment of rrentally retarded persons. \n26.  Earn of the defendant localities receives or is eligible for receipt \nof federal and state funds  for treatment and rehabilitation of rnentally \nretarded persons. \n27.  None of the defendant conmunities has provided appropriate or adequate \nresidential placement for persons  fran the coomunities nON held at Southside \nVirginia Training Center. \nII  28.  None of the defendant ccmmmities has developed appropriate \ncommunity educational,  vocational habilitation or other appropriate \n-5-\n\nprograrrs  for residents now held at Southside Virginia Training Center. \nII  29.  None of the defendant corrmunities have developed or established suf-\nficient residential,  educational, habilitation, vocational or other appropriate \nprograms or social services for retarded persons living in the respective \ncorrmunit ies. \n1 30.  There are over 5,000  mentally retarded individuals who  reside in the \n1 \nrelevant geogra:r:hical area.  Of these,  less than 100  receive appropriate \nresidential services, habilitation and social services. \nI'  31.  Of the rrore than 4, 900  InE!Ibers  of the plaintiff class who  do not \nreceive appropriate services,  the rrajority are being cared for by their \nparents or relatives, who receive sorre public funds,  but who do not receive. \nassistance adequate to allCM them to assure appropriate residential services, \nhabilitation and social services. \n32.  OVer  800  rnetbers of the plaintiff class have  been \"deinstitutionalized' \nwithin the past few  years.  Upon their release fran a  state training sch:>ol, \nthey have not been provided with appropriate residential, habilitation, treat-\nment and social services.  Instead,  these plaintiffs have for the rrost part \nbeen \"dumped\"  on the conmmit ies in whidl they reside because there are \nI \nno appropriate services of any kind for them in the ccmnunit y. \n1~  33.  Over 1,500 rnerbers of the plaintiff class live in residential \nfacilities,  including adult horres,  foster horres,  nursing homes  and instit u-\ntions which receive state and/or federal funds but whidl  fail to provide \nappropriate treatment,  care and habilitation. \nII \nINDIVIIUAL PLAINI'IFF ALLEGATIONS \nII \n34.  Plaintiff William Davis is 40  years old. \n35.  Plaintiff is rroderately mentally retarded and, because of paraparesis, \nwalks with orthopedic shoes  and a  walker. \n36.  Plaintiff was admitted to Lynchburg Training School on Septetber 16, \n1953. \n37.  Plaintiff was  transferred from Lynchburg to Southside Virginia \nTraining Center on March 19 ,  19 80 . \n38.  All of the time that plaintiff has been in Lynchburg and Southside \nVirginia Training Center,  such placement has been inappropriate for him. \n39.  Plaintiff is not receiving,  and has not received since his admission \nto Lynchburg,  appropriate treatrrent,  care or habilitation. \n- 6-\n\n40.  Plaintiff 1 s  confinement in Lyndlburg and Southside Virginia Training \nCenter without appropriate treatment and care has caused substantial impai:rrrent \nin his ability to fimction and to learn and has caused him grave suffering, \npain and hardship. \n41.  Plaintiff is in need of camnunity placerre.nt within the City of \nRichm::md.  He  is in need of appropriate habilitation services and treatrrent \nto accompany that community placement. \nII  42.  Altmugh defendants acknowledge that plaintiff is in need of \nI \ncommunity placement and treatment,  and that he has been in need of such pl~ce­\nrrent and treatment for a  substantial time,  defendants have failed,  and con. ti.n ue \nto fail,  to provide him with ccmnunity placement and appropriate treatment in \nthe cx::rcrrnuni ty . \n11  43.  While confinerrent at Southside Virginia Training Center and the \nprograms available to pl.:iintiff at Southside Virginia Training Center are all \ninappropriate to his needs,  the program which rrost approaches being appro-\npriate to his needs  is the vocational training program.  Plaintiff has been and \nis being excluded from that program because he is handicapped and needs to \nwalk with a  walker and that program is inaccessible to handicapped individuals. \nIt  44.  While plaintiff is said to be receiving several types of programning \nwhile he is at Southside Virginia Training Center,  plaintiff in fact is \nreceiving no  appropriate programming and nothing that can honestly be referred \nto as \"treatment\" of any kind. \nCLAIMS  FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim \n45.  All defendants 1  failure to provide appropriate residential placement \nand treatrrent,  social services,  and habilitation which is appropriate to \nthe needs of the plaintiff class violates the rights of plaintiff and his class \nto appropriate treatment as guaranteed by 42  USC  §6010(1) (2)  and  (3)  and \nVirginia Code §37.1-84 and §37.1-98(e). \nSecorrl Claim \n46.  Defendants 1  cnnfinement of those rrerrbers  of the plaintiff class who \nare in institutions and the failure of all defendants to provide housing for \nand to properly  care for those plaintiffs in a  community setting violates \n-7-\n\nplaintiffs'  right to be provided treatment in the least restrictive alternative \nas guaranteed by 42  USC  §6010(2)  and Virginia Code  §37.1-84.1(6). \n'lhird Claim \nII  47.

Defendants Jean Harris', Kirven's and Buckley's isolation and \nsegregation of plaintiff and that part of the plaintiff class which is held in \nSouthside Virginia Training Center by confining them to Southside Virginia \nTraining Center without offering them anything approaching appropriate treat-\nrnent or habilitation is an unwarranted restriction on plaintiffs'  liberty. \n'Ihis restriction,  isolation, and· segregation of plaintiffs const itutes cruel \nand unusual punishrrent,  in violation of the Eighth and  Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution,  42  USC  §1983 and 42  USC  §6010(2). \nFifth Claim \nII  49.  By  denying plaintiff access to the only program at Southside Virginia \nTraining Center which even approaches a  suitable program for plaintiff because \nof plaintiff 's physical handicap,  defendants Jean Harris,  Kirven and Buckley \nhave  violated and continue to violate plaintiff 1 s  right to be free from \ndiscrimination on the basis of his handicap as guaranteed by 29  USC  § 79 4 and \n42 usc §1983. \nRELIEF  RmUESTED \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court assurre \njurisdiction over this matter and grant the follCMing relief: \n-8-\n\n1.  Detennine this action to be properly brought as a  class action; \n2.  Declare that the defendants 1  actions and failures or refusals to act \nhave violated and continue to violate the constitutional and statutocy rights \nof plaintiff and the class as alleged. \nII  3.
