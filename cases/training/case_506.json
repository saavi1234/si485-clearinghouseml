    "summary": "<p>On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia. Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings. The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons. NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chexmical and physical restraint. Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard. Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress. In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate. In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy. Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care. In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.</p>\r\n<p>Negotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC. In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC. For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors. One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days. Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health.</p>\r\n<p>Virginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied. On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 794, the Social Security Act (\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, <a href=\"../../../../case/427/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. v. Virginia</a>, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital. On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement. On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal. The NVTC plan describes the required compliance. The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services. The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution. For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents. Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual. Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated. Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.</p>\r\n<p>The parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997. On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan. On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "text": "U.S.  Uepartment ot Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney General  Wishington, D.C. 20035\nU.S. v. Virginia\nMR-VA-002-003\nThe Honorable James S. Gilraore, III  ..\nAttorney Gensral  M™  3. /\nCommonwealth cf Virginia\nSuprer.e Court Building\n101 North Eighth St.\nRichmond, VA  23 219\nRe:  Northern Virginia Training Center\nDear Mr. Gilr.ore:\nIn May 1990, we notified then Governor Wilder that, pursuant\nto the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§1997 et sea., the Civil Rights Division of the United States\nDepartment of Justice was commencing an investigation into\nconditions at Northern Virginia Training Center (\"NVTC\"), a\nfacility for approximately 275 developmentally disabled persons\nlocated in Fairfax, Virginia.  Our investigation, which included\na number of tours of NVTC by independent experts, found that\nconditions at NVTC deprived residents of their constitutional\nrights.  We informed Governor Wilder of our findings in a letter\ndated April 9, 1991  (attached).\nMany neetings between this Department and Commonwealth\nofficials and several more expert tours followed, with the\nCommonwealth consistently asserting that the numerous\ndeficiencies had been or were being corrected.  In 1993, after\nthe latest representations by the Commonwealth, this Department\nagain conducted expert tours of NVTC.  Our experts' recent\nfindings make it clear that conditions at NVTC continue to\nviolate the constitutional rights of the residents there,\nsubjecting them to serious harm and unnecessary risk of. harm.\nInadequate medical care, physical therapy, feeding practices and\ntraining programs continue to contribute to unnecessary  resident\nillnesses, injuries and deaths.  Residents continue to suffer\nfractures, serious lacerations and contusions, kicks, punches and\nbites from fellow residents; to injure themselves through\nself-mutilation; to endure unnecessary physical and chemical\nrestraints; to develop acute and chronic respiratory  illnesses\nfrom aspirating  food; to be r.alnourished and dehydrated; to\nswallow or choke on inedible objects; to have prolonged and\nunnecessary seizure activity; and to develop chronic deforr.ities\n\n- 2 -\nand concomitant illnesses due to years of neglect and inadequate\nphysical therapy services.\nGiven the nature of these deficiencies, the ham  that\nresidents have continued to suffer, and the time in which the\nCommonwealth has had to correct the deficiencies, we can no\nlonger delay legal action if the Commonwealth refuses to sicr. a\nconsent decree.\nI•  Background\nSubsequent to Governor Wilder's receipt of the United\nStates' letter of April 1, 1951, which set forth the findings cf\nour experts, several meetings were held between attorneys fcr\nthis Department and attorneys from the Virginia Attorney\nGeneral's Office and officials from the Virginia Department cf\nMental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services\n(\"DMHMR5AS\").  Following our receipt of an outline of remedial\nmeasures Cor.r.o~wealth .officials intended to implement at KVIC,\nthe parties resumed negotiations regarding an agreement to ensure\nthe implementation of corrective measures.\nBased on further assertions that corrective neasures had\nbeen taken, we agreed to retour NVTC twice in the fall of ISSi\nv/ith expert consultants.  We found that conditions at the\nfacility continued to violate the constitutional rights of NVTC\nresidents and we continued to pursue a negotiated agreement to\nensure correction of these violations.  In fact, the United\nStates and the Commonwealth appeared to be in substantial accord\nregarding the terms of an agreement to correct the violations at\nNVTC —  indeed, many if not ir.ost of the substantive terns cf the\nagreement had been worked out.  However, in December 1992, former\nCommonwealth Attorney General, Mary Sue Terry, declined to e\nnte\ninto any enforceable agreement.\nIn early 1993, the Commonwealth's Attorney General's office\ninformed us that additional corrective actions had been taken and\nthat the facility was now in full compliance with constitutional\nstandards.  Accordingly, it was agreed that Department attorneys\nand expert consultants would yet again tour NVTC to evaluate the\nconditions there and that the findings of the experts would ire\nturned over to the Commonwealth's Attorney General's office prior\nto the Department taking any additional action.\nThe findings of the five experts who toured NVTC, as\nembodied in their attached reports, make it clear that while some\ncorrective actions have been taken at the facility, violations of\nthe residents' constitutional rights continue and the residents\ncontinue to suffer serious harm.  The deficiencies cited by the\nfive experts  (two psychologists, a physician, a registered\nphysical therapist, and a pharmacist) are consistent with the\n\n- 4 -\nwhether individualized habilitation programs can meet the r.esds\nof residents.\nB.  Failure to provide and implement training proarar.s\nresults in the excessive use of restraints without\njustification.\nThe expert: consultants also found that NVTC fails to provide\nadequate training programs, especially for individuals who\nexhibit naladaptive behaviors.  NVTC's assessments of the\nunderlying function of maladaptive behavior such as aggression\nand self-injury are inconsistent with professional standards, and\nthe resulting individualized behavior plans are insufficier.- T:O\nneet the needs of the residents.  For example, there is\ninadequate management of, and training programs for, individuals\nwith serious pica behavior  (eating inedibles).  The absence of\nindividualized behavior plans based upon appropriate functional\nanalyses, subjects clients to the risk of an over-dependence and\nmisuse of physical or chemical restraint and physical and\npsychological harm.  The excessive use of restraints without\nadequate justification has been an issue that has been\ncontinually brought to the attention of NVTC, and while progress\nhas been made in this area since our first tours, the psychelegy\nand medical experts discovered that this is still a serious\nproblem at NVTC.\nIn addition, many residents who could greatly benefit frcr.\nsystematic behavior management programs do not have them.\nTraining in communication, social, self-help, and related skills\nis essential to promote and protect the health and well-being of\nthese individuals and permit them to function as independer.-iy as\npossible.  Such training at NVTC is grossly'inadequate.  Fcr\nexample, safe eating skills often must be taught to individuals\nwho otherwise may be at risk of choking and asphyxiation.\nHowever, both psychology and physical therapy experts noted that\neating skills simply were not addressed by the staff and the\nfailure to do so has resulted in both an increased risk of injury\nand the failure of residents to learn these skills.  This finding\nalso applies to programs designed to teach residents the\nactivities of daily living, e.g., dressing, toileting, and other\nself-care skills.\nThe psychology consultants also found that training and\nservice planning are not directed towards facilitating resident\ntransition into community-based programs which are or can be made\navailable to meet their individual needs.\nIII.  Professional and Direct Care Staff are Inadequate Both in\nTerms of Numbers and Qualifications.\nThe expert consultants were unanimous in their findings\nthat, while irVTC has apparently made some recent progress in\n\n- 5 -\nhiring and training both professional and non-professional staff,\nNVTC still does not employ a sufficient number of trained\npersonnel tc r.eet the basic needs of its residents.. NVTC is\ncritically  in reed of more psychologists, and physical end\noccupational therapists.  NVTC also employs insufficient nur.bers\nof nedical personnel to cover some shifts and weekends.  The\nstaff that is presently employed require considerably nore\ntraining before they will be able to provide adequate care.  Tr.is\nlack of adequate numbers of trained staff may contribute in part\nto the lack cf adequate staff supervision and some employees'\nunfaiailiarity vith \"ttte «sfesidents under their care.\nIV.  Nedical Care is Inadequate.\nThe medical consultant found substantial deficiencies in a\nnumber of key r.edical areas that are resulting in harm ana\nunnecessary risk of harm to the residents of NVTC.  These\ndeficiencies include, inter alia:  delayed and inadequate\nresponse to r.edical emergencies; inadequate seizure charting and\nmanagement, including emergency management of prolonged,\nlife-threatening acute seizures; insufficient coverage and\nco-jnunication by physicians on nights and weekends; over-reliance\non use of psychotropic medications without clear indications for\ntheir use; lack of quality assurance; and lack of adequately\ntrained professional nedical staff.  In a number of cases, these\ndeficiencies or a combination of them, led to potentially\navoidable injuries, illnesses and death.\nV.  Medical Charting and Medication Practices are Seriously\nDeficient.\nThe ph.an.acy and medical experts also found medical charting\nand medication practices to be generally inadequate and observed\na lack of documented communication between care providers,\nphysicians, nurses and pharmacists.  Adequate record keeping and\ninterdisciplinary communication are essential if residents are to\nbe provided adequate medical care.  Both experts found\nsignificant deficiencies in individual medical plans, quality\nassurance mechanisms and data collection.  They also found\ninconsistent monitoring of and follow-up on medication side\neffects.  The pharmacist noted that, although some new policies\nand procedures had recently been written, they were very new and\nhad not been fully implemented as of the date of our review.\nVI.  Feedinc: Practices are Dangerous.\nThe medical, physical therapy and psychology experts all\nfound feeding practices to be dangerously deficient.  Residents\nwere observed coughing, gagging and choking due to staff feeding\nthe residents inappropriately, e.g. . feeding residents too r.uch\ntoo quickly, or feeding residents with their necks hyperextended.\nStaff are insufficiently trained to feed residents safely cr\n\n- 6 -\nproperly assis: residents to feed themselves or train the- ir.\nsafe eating sV.ills.  Such dangerous practices have devastat ir.3\nresults for residents who are medically fragile, or have poor\nchewing, svalloving skills or compromised gag reflexes.\nVII.  Phvsicei and Nutritional Management is Deficient.\nNVTC has a severe shortage of sufficiently trained physical\ntherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians to adeqvi=.i=ly\nmeet the basic needs of the residents, over 100 of whom have\nsevere physical disabilities.  This shortage of trained\nprofessionals has resulted in inadequate training and oversight\nof direct care staff, inadequate identification and compreher.s ive\n\"treatnent of health and nutritional problems, and resident\nidleness, ir^cbility, physical and nental deterioration, ar.c ill\nhealth.  A r.ur-ber of residents are substantially undenv'eic'r.;,\nnalnourished cr dehydrated.  in many cases, the residents'\nphysical deformities, and the pain and ill health caused by the\ndeformities, are a result of years of neglect by NVTC.  Physical\ntherapy and therapeutic equipment are entirely inadequate tc r.eet\nthe needs of the physically disabled NVTC residents.\nVIII.  P.ecorckeeoina Fails to Comport with Professional\nStandards.\nInstitutional care-providers such as NVTC must keep\naccurate, co-prehensive and accessible records in order tc remit\nprofessional judgment to be exercised and to ensure the provision\nof adequate care to the residents.  The expert consultants vsre\nunanimous in their finding that recordkeeping at NVTC is grossly\ndeficient.  In some areas essential data on resident behavior or\nhealth is not recorded, and where it is recorded, it is\ninaccurate or incomplete.  Important behavioral or medical\ninformation contained in residents' records is not acknowledged\nin the residents' comprehensive plans or elsewhere in their\ntreatment planning.  Necessary quality assurance mechanisms do\nnot appear to be working or in place.\nIX.  Conclusion\nThe long-standing problems cited above continue to pose a\nsubstantial threat to the health and safety of NVTC residents,\ndeny them adequate care, and skills necessary to permit the- to\nfunction as normally and as independently as possible.  Given the\nnature of NVTC's long-standing constitutional violations, the\ntime that has already passed, and the additional time needed to\nremedy these violations,' we can no longer delay legal action if\nthe Commonwealth continues to refuse to resolve this matter fcy £\nmutually negotiated and agreed upon consent decree.  Vihile we\nbelieve that it would be mutually beneficial to settle this\n\n- 7 -\nnatter and are still willing to do so, action nust be taken\nexpeditiously  ir. order to protect NVTC residents.  We would\nappreciate fceir.r informed of your decision at an early date\nSine\n-  /\nDeval L. Patrick\nAssistant Attorney General\nCivil Rights Division\nEnclosures\ncc:  King E.

      "text": "U.S. Department  of Justice\nCivil  Rights  Division\n<>r?lV.' of the AS^^K:  A:: • ,:  U^.::  IU^, «.,•:.•«. D.C  X<\\>.'\nFebruary  S,  lv'05\nThe  Honorable  George  Allen  U.S. v. Virginia\n= : : : • : ; : ;,  nc DHiiiiliiiii\nRe: Northern Virginia Training Center\nDear Governor Allen:\nMy staff and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with\nyour Deputy Attorney General, William Hurd, and his staff on\nJanuary 31, 1995, to discuss our investigations pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of three\ninstitutions  (Northern Virginia Training Center, Eastern State\nHospital, and Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute) operated\nby the Commonwealth.  We have agreed to meet again on or before\nFebruary 10, 1995., in order to determine whether we can cone to\nsome agreements in these matters.\nPrior to that meeting, we thought it appropriate to further\napprise you of our most recent findings and our determination\nthat federal statutory violations exist at the Northern Virginia\nTraining Center  (\"NVTC\").  Our investigation of NVTC was\ninitiated in May 1990 and has been pending absent any resolution\nfor a protracted period of time.\nFollowing a full evaluation of conditions at NVTC, we nost\nrecently advised Commonwealth officials of our findings of\ncontinuing constitutional violations at the facility in a letter\ndated May 31, 1994, addressed to Attorney General Gilmore.  In\nsummary, our consultants found numerous dangerous conditions at\nthe facility.  More specifically, they found deficiencies in\nresident assessment, the design and implementation of training\nprograms, excessive and unjustifiable use of physical restraints,\ninadequate numbers of direct care and professional staff,\ninadequate medical care, including medication practices, and\nimproper feeding of physically disabled residents.  A copy of our\nletter to Mr. Gilmore is attached for your further information.\n\n- 2 -\nIn addition, our review of this matter has led us to\ndetermine that the federal statutory rights of residents are\nbeing violated.  More specifically, residents' rights pursuant to\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101\net seq.. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section\n504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq.. and the provisions of Title XIX\nof the Social Security Act (\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396 et sea, are being violated by various acts, practices, and\nconditions at NVTC.  Our review also indicates that the rights of\nthe residents guaranteed by Virginia state law are also being\nviolated.  See, e.g.. Va. Code Ann. § 37.1 - 84.1 (Mitchie 1994).\nNVTC fails to provide an environment which meets the needs\nof residents, promotes their growth, development, and social\nwell-being and permits contact with mainstream social\ninstitutions.  By design and function, residents are separated\nfrom society.  Where residents can benefit from placement in\ncommunity based programs and facilities, and especially where\nprofessionals have determined that such placement is appropriate,\nthis unnecessary segregation of the developmentally disabled\nviolates both the ADA and Section 504.  Moreover, we note that\nmany of the residents at NVTC have behavior problems or medical\nneeds which have been used to justify their continued confinement\nat the facility.  Justifying continued confinement on such\ngrounds, particularly where services ostensibly designed to treat\nsuch problems are so inadequate, constitutes the very\ndiscrimination both the ADA and Section 504 are designed to\nprohibit.  Justifying confinement at NVTC on the basis of the\nseverity of handicap is likewise discriminatory absent a\nprofessional determination that such confinement is essential to\nthe care of an individual resident.\nMany of the areas identified during our investigation of\nNVTC as constituting constitutional violations also are\nsubstantive violations of the Social Security Act and regulations\nimplementing the Medicaid program.  Deficiencies in the areas of\ntraining and medical care are the clearest examples.\nAs we have specified in other correspondence, we believe\nthat remedies are necessary to eliminate continuing\nconstitutional violations as well as the federal statutory\nviolations set forth here.  More specifically, the Commonwealth\nshould implement the following remedies:\n1)  Provide for each resident a professionally designed and\nimplemented training program that will teach new skills, foster\ngrowth and development, and permit each resident to exercise\nindependence.  Such programs must be designed and implemented by\nsufficient numbers of appropriately qualified and trained staff,\n\n- 3 -\nincluding both direct care and professional  staff.  Immediate\nattention  should be given to those residents exhibiting the most\ndangerous behaviors and behaviors presently being managed by the\nuse cf restrictive measures, including physical  restraints.\n2)  Staffing  at all levels should be enhanced to provide\nnecessary  care, treatment, and training, and to ensure the\npersonal  safety of all residents.\n3)  Assessment  and evaluation of the individual needs of\nresidents must be improved to reflect consistent compliance with\ngenerally accepted professional  standards.\n4)  Medical care must be significantly  improved.\n5)  Physical restraints should be phased out to be used only\nin case of genuine emergency; the elimination of the  facility's\nchronic over-reliance on the use of physical restraints will\nrequire a complete reviev; of the facility's  psychology\ndepartment, adherence to generally accepted  professional\nstandards emphasizing positive reinforcement techniques, and the\nappointment of facility leadership committed to restructuring  the\nfacility's overall approach to training programs,  especially\nprograms designed to address behavior problems.\n6)  Medication and medical charting practices must be\nrevised to conform with generally accepted medical standards.\n7)  Feeding practices should be revised to ensure the safety\nand well-being  of physically disabled residents who are fed by\nstaff.  To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to  fully\nevaluate present feeding techniques, evaluate each  physically\ndisabled resident to identify safe feeding procedures, train\nstaff in such procedures, and carefully monitor their\nimplementation  as residents are actually being fed by staff.\nThis evaluation process should include assessments both  for\nproper nutritional management and other needed therapies, e.c..\nphysical  therapy.\n8)  Commonwealth officials need to expand community  based\nprograms to meet the individualized needs of NVTC residents who\nshould be served  in community programs.  All residents should be\nevaluated  for community placement by an inter-disciplinary  team,\nincluding appropriately  trained professionals who have  experience\nin operating community programs.  No resident should be precluded\nfrom community placement based on their degree of disability  or\nother handicapping  condition.\n9)  Commonwealth officials need to develop an overall plan\nto eliminate all of the deficiencies  identified  in the course of\nthis investigation  and communicated to such officials,  including\n\n- 4 -\nnecessary steps to achieve substantive compliance with federal\nand state lav.\nIn closing, I can only express my hope that we can work\ntogether to resolve this long outstanding matter to the benefit\nof the developmentally disabled and mentally retarded residents\nof the Northern Virginia Training Center.\nSincerely,\nDeval L.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA\nAlexandria Division\n8\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nv. Case Number: 96-283-A\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, et  al.,\nDefendants.\nSETTLEMENT  AGREEMENT\nThe United States of America (hereinafter the \"United States\"), and the Commonwealth\nof Virginia (hereinafter  \"Virginia\"), agree to settle the above captioned matter (hereinafter  \"this\nAction\") on the terms and conditions set forth below in this Settlement Agreement  (hereinafter\nthe \"Agreement\").\nI.  Introduction.\nA.  By letter dated May 4,  1990, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights,\nUnited  States Department  of Justice,  informed  the then Governor  of the Commonwealth  of\nVirginia  that the  United  States  was  commencing  an  investigation  of  the  Northern  Virginia\nTraining Center (hereinafter  \"NVTC\") pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons\nAct (hereinafter  \"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C.  § 1997 et seq.\nB.  NVTC is an institution covered by CRIPA and operated by Virginia to provide\nhabilitation and other services to persons with developmental disabilities and mental retardation.  <-•\nA True Copy,  Teste:\nNorman  H^Jjsejye\nBy-\nDeputy Clerk\nU.S. v. Virginia\n~~\"  ™  HH  ••  ••  •  B\nMR-VA-002-007\n\nC.  On July 16-17,1990, and continuing from time to time through September 13-15,\n1993,  representatives  of the  United  States  conducted  on-site  inspections  and  evaluations  of\nNVTC.\nD.  As a result of these examinations and inspections, the United States advised the\nGovernor of Virginia, in letters dated April 9, 1991, May 31, 1994, and February 8, 1995, that,\nin  its  opinion,  conditions  at  NVTC  constituted  a  pattern  or  practice  of  violations  of  the\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of NVTC residents.\nE.  Beginning  in  1991  and  continuing  from  time  to  time  thereafter,  Virginia\nvoluntarily  developed  and commenced  implementation of  a written plan to address  the care\nprovided at NVTC (\"the Plan\") (\"Exhibit A\").\nF.  Virginia has at all times denied that conditions at NVTC violate the constitutional\nor federal statutory rights of residents at NVTC.\nG.  Virginia has at all times maintained that, as a matter of state policy, it aspires to\nprovide a level of care to NVTC residents in excess of what it regards as the minimal level of\ncare required by the Constitution and federal law.  By entering into this Agreement and agreeing\nto implement the Plan, Virginia does not admit that any of the terms of such documents or the\nlevel of care it provides are legally required pursuant to the Constitution or federal law.\nH.  On March 4,  1996, the United States filed the complaint in this Action.\nI.  The  parties  agree  it  is  in  their  mutual  interests  to  avoid  the  continuation  of\nadversarial litigation.  To that end, the parties have resolved their differences by agreeing upon\nthe Plan and upon methods of communication and conciliation as set forth in this Agreement.\n\nThe parties recognize that implementation of the Plan provides NVTC residents with a level of\ncare satisfying all constitutional and federal statutory standards at issue in this Action.\nJ.  The parties agree that the resolution of this case is in the best interests of NVTC\nresidents, and otherwise in the best interests of their common citizens.\nAccordingly, the parties agree as follows:\nII.  Rule 41(a)(2) Dismissal Without Prejudice.\nImmediately upon execution of this Agreement, the parties shall jointly move the Court\nfor  entry of an Order of dismissal without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2),  in the  form\nattached as Exhibit B.  In the event the Court refuses or fails to enter that Order in the attached\nform, this Agreement shall be null and void.\nHI.  Dismissal With Prejudice.\n1.  The  Court  shall  enter  a  dismissal  of  this  Action  with  prejudice  upon  the\noccurrence of one or more of the following conditions:\na.  In the event the United States fails to file a Motion to Restore (defined in\n§ Vm  below), Virginia shall be conclusively entitled to an order dismissing this Action with\nprejudice exactly nine months from the Notice Date (defined in § VII below);\nb.  Joint motion of the parties;\nc.  Unopposed motion of defendants; or\nd.  In the event the United States files a Motion to Restore pursuant to the\nprocedures set forth in § Vm below, but the Court does not find that Virginia failed to achieve\nsubstantial compliance with the Plan.\n\nIV.  Plan Implementation.\nVirginia agrees to implement the Plan by the Notice Date, as defined in § VII(2) below.\nV.  Consultation Tour.\n1.  To allow the United States an opportunity to observe Virginia's implementation\nof the Plan, and to promote the sharing of technical information and the amicable resolution of\nany disagreements, the United States shall retain expert consultants to tour NVTC to assess the\nstatus of such implementation and to confer with NVTC with respect to such implementation.\n2.  On dates mutually agreed upon by the parties, but no later than 45 days after entry\nof the Order described in § II above, the United  States shall tour the facility  with its expert\nconsultants, after  reasonable notice to Virginia  of the identity and curriculum vitae of those\nconsultants.  Within 10 days of entry of the Order, the United States shall inform Virginia of\nthe documents its expert consultants will need in preparation for the tour.  Said documents shall\nbe substantially similar to those previously requested and provided during expert consultant tours\nof NVTC.  The United States agrees to provide information to Virginia based on these tours\nwithin 45 days of the tours.  The parties agree to confer  regarding the desirability of  further\nsharing  of  technical  information,  including  a conference  between  the  United  States'  expert\nconsultants and Virginia's professionals.\n3.  The  United  States'  expert  consultants  shall  tour  NVTC  utilizing  the  same\nprocedures used during prior United States' expert consultant tours at NVTC, including but not\nlimited to procedures governing confidentiality  of patient records.\n4.  The  United  States shall not commence  or  support  any  civil action under  this\nAgreement or otherwise, or initiate any other CRIPA proceeding against Virginia, based on any\n\nmatter observed during these tours or documents produced in connection with the tours.  The\nfindings and conclusions of the United States' expert consultants based on this tour shall not be\nused by the United States in any court proceeding, nor shall they be disclosed or used by the\nUnited States for any purpose other than as set forth in § V of this Agreement.\nVI.  Tnterjm Reports.\n1.  Beginning on October IS, 1996, and continuing every three months thereafter until\nthe Notice Date, defined in § VII below, Virginia shall provide the United States with quarterly\nsummaries of each reported Category I and II incident as defined in the Standard Administrative\nPractices and Procedures Manual, Chapter 28, Reporting and Responding to Unusual Incidents,\nAppendix B (Exhibit C) occurring at NVTC (hereinafter \"Incident Summaries11), and each open\nor founded allegation of abuse and/or neglect as defined in Departmental Instruction #33 (Exhibit\nD) (hereinafter  \"Abuse/Neglect Summaries\").  The Incident Summaries shall be in the form\nattached as Exhibit E.  The Abuse/Neglect Summaries shall be in the form attached as Exhibit F.\n2.  The  United  States  may  request  reasonable  follow-up  information,  including\ndocuments from Virginia with respect to any incident identified on the Incident and/or Abuse\nand Neglect Summaries.\n3.  The  United  States  shall  advise  Virginia  of  any  alleged  deficiencies  in  the\nimplementation of the Plan ascertained from its evaluation of Incident and/or Abuse and Neglect\nSummaries and follow-up information.  Virginia agrees to confer with the United States, in\nperson or in writing, with respect to any such alleged deficiencies.\n\nVII.  Certification Tour.\n1.  The purpose of the certification tour is to permit the United States to assess the\nstatus of Virginia's implementation of the Plan before this case is dismissed with prejudice as\nprovided by § m,  so that the United States may file a Motion to Restore, if necessary, pursuant\nto § vm.\n2.  On or before June  1,  1997, Virginia shall provide written notice to the United\nStates  that  it  may  conduct  the  certification  tour.  A  copy  of  the  notice  shall  be  filed\nsimultaneously with the Clerk of the U.S. District Court in Alexandria.  If Virginia fails to send\nthis notice on or before June 1, 1997, the United States shall have the right to provide written\nnotice to Virginia that it will conduct the certification tour.  A copy of the notice shall be filed\nsimultaneously with the Clerk of the U.S. District Court in Alexandria.  The date such notice\nis filed  with the Clerk, either by Virginia or the United States, shall be deemed the  \"Notice\nDate\" for purposes of this Agreement.\n3.  During  the  first  month after  the Notice  Date,  the United  States  shall  inform\nVirginia of (i) the identity and vitae of any expert consultants it will retain to assess Virginia's\ncompliance with the Plan, and (ii) the documents it seeks to assess Virginia's compliance with\nthe Plan, which shall be substantially similar to those previously requested and provided during\nexpert consultant tours of NVTC.\n4.  No later than the second month after the Notice Date, Virginia shall inform the\nUnited States of the identity and vitae of any expert consultants it will retain for the certification\ntour, and shall provide the United States with the requested documents.\n\n5.  No sooner than the third month and no later than the end of the fourth month after\nthe Notice Date, the United States' attorneys and expert consultants shall tour NVTC to assess\nthe  status  of Virginia's  compliance  with the  Plan.  The  procedures  for  such  tour  shall  be\nsubstantially similar to those previously used during expert consultant tours at NVTC (including,\nbut not limited to, procedures governing confidentiality of patient records), except that Virginia\nshall have  the right for  its own attorneys and expert consultants to accompany  those of  the\nUnited States on all aspects of the tour.\n6.  No later than the fifth month after the Notice Date, Virginia and the United States\nshall  receive  from  their  respective  expert  consultants  their  reports  evaluating  Virginia's\nimplementation of the Plan.  In selecting and retaining their expert consultants, the United States\nand Virginia shall each be responsible for assuring that said expert reports can be completed by\ntheir expert consultants within this time period.\n7.  No later than the sixth month after the Notice Date, the United States shall notify\nVirginia of any alleged deficiencies in Virginia's implementation of the Plan.  The United States\nshall specify by page numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs, each provision of the Plan which\nit alleges has been implemented  in a deficient  manner.  The United States shall set forth  in\nreasonable detail (i) the evidentiary basis of its allegations of deficiency  and (ii) the remedial\nmeasures which it proposes to remedy each deficiency.  The reasonable details to be provided\nshall include,  but not be limited  to,  a complete  statement  of all the opinions of  any  expert\nconsultants, on which the United States relies, the basis and reasons for such opinions and the\ninformation considered by the expert in forming such opinions.\n\n8.  No later than the seventh month after the Notice Date, Virginia shall notify  the\nUnited  States  of  Virginia's  concurrence  or  disagreement  with  each  of  the  United  States'\nallegations of deficiency and proposed remedial measures.  If Virginia concurs with any of the\nUnited States' allegations of deficiency,  but disagrees with the proposed remedial measure, it\nshall propose an alternative remedial measure.\n9.  During the seventh and eighth months following the Notice Date, Virginia and the\nUnited  States  shall endeavor  in good  faith  to resolve  any disputes  over the United  States'\nallegations of deficiency and/or disputes over the proposed remedial measures.  The conciliation\nprocess shall include at least one face-to-face meeting between representatives of the parties; and\nif such meeting does not achieve conciliation, then the conciliation process shall continue with\na prompt mediation session before  a judicial officer,  if feasible under the timeframes  in this\nAgreement.  During the conciliation process,  Virginia  shall have the right,  but shall not be\nrequired, to support its position by disclosing relevant portions of its expert reports.\nVin.  Motion to Restore the Action.\n1.  In the event Virginia  and the United  States are unable to resolve  any  dispute\nconcerning  the  United  States'  allegations  of  Virginia's  failure  to  implement  the  Plan  or  a\nprovision of the Plan, but in no event earlier than the end of the eighth month following  the\nNotice Date, the United States may file a motion to vacate the dismissal without prejudice and\nto  restore  the Action to the Court's  active docket  (\"Motion  to Restore\")  for  the purpose of\nadjudicating allegations by the United States that Virginia has failed to substantially comply with\nthe Plan.\n8\n\n2.  The Motion to Restore shall (i) identify  those portions of the Plan the United\nStates  alleges  that  Virginia  has  violated,  specifying  Plan  page  numbers,  paragraphs  and\nsubparagraphs; and (ii) identify with reasonable specificity the remedial measure sought by the\nUnited States.\n3.  Any Motion to Restore shall be served upon counsel for Virginia by  certified\nmail, return receipt requested.\n4.  Unless a different  time is ordered by Order of the Court, Virginia  shall have\ntwenty (20) days from the receipt of such motion to file its response.\n5.  Upon  the  filing  of  the  Motion  to  Restore,  the  Action  shall  be  litigated  in\naccordance with the applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Local Rules, and orders of the\nCourt,  including but not limited to such rules and orders pertaining  to discovery;  provided,\nhowever, that the Complaint shall be deemed amended and superseded in accordance with the\nallegations set forth within the Motion to Restore pursuant to 1 2 above.\n6.  The United States shall have the burden of proof.  To prevail, the United States\nmust show that Virginia failed to achieve substantial compliance with the Plan.\n7.  The parties shall request the Court to hear such motions and to conduct such trial\nas may be necessary to adjudicate the Motion to Restore and the Action, including the allegations\nset forth pursuant to 12 above.  If the Court finds that Virginia is in substantial compliance with\nthe Plan, it shall dismiss this Action with prejudice.  If the Court finds that Virginia is not in\nsubstantial compliance with the Plan, it may order specific performance of those portions of the\nPlan which the Court finds Virginia has violated.\n\n8.  The exclusive remedy for any alleged failure by Virginia to achieve substantial\ncompliance with the Plan shall be an Order for  specific performance  pursuant to 1 7 above;\nprovided, however, that this limitation shall not be construed as an attempt to limit the power\nof the court  in the event any  such order  for  specific  performance  is entered  and  thereafter\nviolated.  Any such order for specific performance may be directed against Virginia and/or such\nofficials  whom the Court may determine are responsible for such violations.  Neither Virginia\nnor any officials thereof shall be subject to a finding of,  or sanctions for, contempt unless an\norder for specific performance has been entered pursuant to a Motion to Restore and is thereafter\nviolated in such a manner as to make such a finding or sanctions appropriate.  The provisions\nof this paragraph are of the \"essence of this Agreement.\nDC.  Emergency Provision.\n1.  The  United  States may  seek  immediate  relief  from  the Court  for  the  limited\npurpose of redressing an alleged emergency at NVTC.  An emergency shall be defined  as a\npattern or practice of violating the Plan that creates an immediate, substantial risk of serious\nbodily harm to NVTC resident(s).\n2.  In any motion seeking relief for an alleged emergency, the United States shall file\nan enhanced pleading which sets forth the specific facts on which an emergency is alleged, the\nspecific violations of the Plan, and the legal basis for the allegations (hereinafter  \"Motion for\nEmergency Relief\").\n3.  The parties shall confer in good faith in an effort to resolve any such allegations\nprior to filing any such Motion for Emergency Relief.\n10\n\n4.  Any Motion for Emergency Relief shall be served upon counsel for Virginia by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested.\n5.  Unless a different  time is ordered by Order of the Court,  Virginia  shall have\ntwenty (20) days from the receipt of such motion to file its response.\n6.  Upon the filing of any Motion for Emergency Relief, the motion shall be litigated\nin accordance with the applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Local Rules, and orders of\nthe Court, including, but not limited to, such rules and orders pertaining to discovery.\n7.  The United States shall have the burden of proof.  To prevail, the United States\nmust prove the existence of an emergency as defined in 1 1 above.\n8.  The parties shall request the Court to hear such motions and to conduct such trials\nas may be necessary to adjudicate the Motion for Emergency Relief, including the allegations\nas required  by f 2 above.  If the Court finds  that no emergency exists,  it shall dismiss the\nMotion with prejudice.  This dismissal shall have no effect  on the United States' ability to file\na Motion to Restore pursuant to § VIII.  If the Court finds that an emergency exists, it may\norder specific performance of those portions of the Plan which the Court finds gave rise to the\nemergency.\n9.  The exclusive remedy for an alleged emergency  shall be specific  performance,\npursuant to 5 8 above; provided, however, that this limitation shall not be construed to limit the\npower of the court in the event any such order for specific performance is entered and thereafter\nviolated.  Any order for  specific  performance  may be directed  against Virginia and/or  such\nofficials whom the Court may determine are responsible for such emergencies.  Neither Virginia\nnor any officials  thereof shall be subject to a finding of,  or sanctions for, contempt unless an\n11\n\norder for specific performance has been entered pursuant to a Motion for Emergency Relief and\nf\nis thereafter violated in such a manner as to make such findings or sanctions appropriate.\nX.  Interpretation of the Plan.\n1.  The parties recognize that portions of the Plan must be interpreted  in light of\nstandards not expressly set forth in the Plan.  In such cases, for purposes of determining whether\nNVTC has implemented the Plan, or any portion thereof, the parties agree that the relevant and\napplicable  standard  shall  be  as  follows:  Decisions  by  Virginia  with  respect  to  the\nimplementation  of  policies,  procedures,  and  other  activities  required  by  the  Plan  shall  be\nevaluated  for  the  purpose  of  determining  compliance  with  the  Plan  by  the  \"professional\njudgment\" standard articulated in Youngberg v. Romeo,  457 U.S. 457 (1982).\n2.  This  Agreement,  together  with  attachments,  is  an  integrated  document  and\ncontains  the  entire  agreement  between  the  parties,  and  wholly  cancels,  terminates,  and\nsupersedes  any and all previous and/or contemporaneous  oral agreements,  negotiations,  and\ncommitments and writings between the parties thereto with respect to this Action and NVTC.\n3.  Except as provided in 1 7 below, no change, modification, extension, termination,\ndischarge, abandonment or waiver of this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof, nor any\nrepresentation, promise or condition relating to this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties\nhereto unless made in writing and signed by the parties or their counsel.\n4.  Nothing  contained  in this Agreement  or  in the Plan  shall be construed  as an\nadmission or evidence (i) that practices at NVTC at anytime or in any way violated constitutional\nstandards or other legal standards governing the provision of care at NVTC, (ii) that the terms\nof the  Agreement  or  the Plan are  necessary  to  meet constitutional  standards  or  other  legal\n12\n\nstandards governing the provision of care at NVTC, or (iii) that the policies, practices, and\nprocedures described in the Plan  did not exist at NVTC prior to the initiation of the CRIPA\ninvestigation, nor shall this Agreement nor the Plan be used by any person or party as the basis\nfor any liability of Virginia except as expressly provided herein with respect to this Action.\n5.  Each of the terms of the Agreement and the Plan shall be deemed to have been\nmutually drafted by the parties, and shall not be construed against either party as the author\nthereof.\n6.  Deadlines and time references  (e.g. use of present and past tenses) used in the\nPlan shall be treated as NVTC's internal planning objectives and reflect NVTC's schedule for\nimplementation as of the original and/or a revised date of the Plan.  They may be used  for\npurposes of consultation between the United States and Virginia, pursuant to the Consultation\nTour provided by § V.  Notwithstanding such deadlines and time references,  NVTC shall be\ndeemed  to have implemented the Plan for  all purposes under this Agreement  if  it has been\nimplemented by the Notice Date.\n7.  Virginia shall have uie right to propose modifications to the Plan from  time to\ntime by giving the United States written notice of the language proposed for deletion from and/or\naddition to the Plan.  Such proposed modifications  shall be deemed effective  for all purposes\nunder  this  Agreement  on  the  date  specified  in the proposal  unless  the  United  States  gives\nVirginia  written  notice  of  its  objection  within  thirty  days  of  its  receipt  of  the  proposed\nmodification.\n8.  Virginia shall not be deemed to have failed to achieve substantial compliance with\nthe Plan due to any shortage of staff where such shortage is the result of an unusual level of\n13\n\nabsences beyond Virginia's reasonable control, or vacancies created by the death,  discharge,\nretirement or resignation of any employee or by the creation of new positions in response to an\nincrease in census, so long as Virginia takes necessary  steps to fill  any such vacancies  with\nreasonable promptness.\nXI.  Miscellaneous.\n1.  The parties shall request that the Motion to Restore and any other proceeding held\nin this case be heard by the Honorable Leonie M. Brinkema, United States District Judge.  Any\nparty may file a motion to vacate the dismissal without prejudice and to restore the case to the\nactive docket for the limited purpose of adjudicating  an alleged violation of § V, VI or VII of\nthis Agreement.  Any such motion shall be adjudicated pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure and the local rules of this Court.  Any such motion shall state the paragraphs of the\nAgreement that are alleged to be violated.  The exclusive remedy for any such violation shall\nbe an order for specific performance.  Any such order for specific performance shall be directed\nagainst such officials whom the Court may determine are responsible for such violations.  No\nparty nor any official thereof shall be subject to a finding of,  or sanctions for, contempt unless\nsuch an order for specific performance has been hereafter  entered and is thereafter violated in\nsuch a manner as to make such finding or sanctions appropriate.  The parties shall attempt in\ngood  faith  to  resolve  any  dispute  prior  to  filing  any  motion  alleging  a  violation  of  this\nAgreement.\n2.  This  Agreement  shall  be  applicable  to  and  binding  on  the  parties  to  the\nAgreement, their officers,  agents, employees, and successors.\n3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement,  the United States shall\n14\n\nhave no standing to seek, nor shall it be entitled to entry of,  any order for specific  performance\nthat would, as a practical matter, require the expenditure of funds in any biennium in excess of\nthe level  of  funding  appropriated  for  the  facility  by  the  General  Assembly  in the  1996-98\nbiennium.  Virginia represents its good faith belief that the funding for the 1996-1998 biennium\nis sufficient to implement the Plan.\n4.  This Agreement and the Rule 41(a)(2) Dismissal referenced  in this Agreement\nresolve all of the allegations raised in the Complaint.  The United States shall not amend its\nComplaint (except as provided in § Vm,  112, 8 above) nor file any new CRIPA action based\non events at NVTC occurring prior to any dismissal with prejudice of this Action.\n5.  Each party shall bear its own costs, including attorney's fees, except that Virginia\nmay  move  for  attorney's  fees  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § 1997a(c)  at the conclusion  of  any\nproceeding brought by the United States pursuant to §§ VIQ and DC herein.\n6.  An executed copy of this Agreement shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court,\nand a copy delivered to the Honorable Leonie M. Brinkema, United States District Judge.\n7.  The following  shall govern the termination of Virginia's obligations under the\nAgreement and Plan:\n(a)  subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), Virginia's obligation with respect\nto the Agreement and the Plan shall terminate nine months from the Notice Date or with\nthe entry of a Dismissal with Prejudice, whichever is earlier.\n(b)  With respect to any provisions of the Plan which are the subject of a Motion to\nRestore  under  § VIE,  the  obligations  of  such  provisions  shall  continue  pending  an\nadjudication of such Motion to Restore.\n15\n\n(c)  With respect to any provisions of the Plan for which the Court has entered an\norder for specific performance, the parties agree to jointly move the Court to dismiss\nsuch orders and to dismiss the case with prejudice within one year from the date such\norder for specific performance was entered, unless and to the extent that the United\nStates has moved for a finding of civil contempt with respect to such order within said\none year period.\n(d)  If the United States moves for a finding of civil contempt, but the Court finds no\nsuch contempt, Virginia's obligations under the Agreement and Plan shall terminate as\nof  that time with respect to the provision(s)  that was the subject of  said motion for\ncontempt.\n(e)  If a finding of civil contempt has been made, the obligations under the provisions\nof the Plan with respect to which such finding has been made shall be extended for such\nperiod as may be required by the Court as a remedy for such contempt.\n8.

The Plan is incorporated by reference into\nthe Settlement Agreement executed by the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States\nof America, and is subject to the terms thereof.\n\nI.  DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAINING PROGRAMS UTILIZING\nPOSITIVE TRAINING TECHNIQUES\nNVTC  provides  training  programs  developed  by  qualified  professionals  utilizing\npositive  training  techniques  designed  to  afford  skill  development,  personal  safety and\nreasonable use of restraints and prevent regression of residents.  In order to accomplish\nthese programs, NVTC will:\nA.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will professionally evaluate and/or re-evaluate each\nresident using multi-disciplinary evaluations, as needed. Each individual will receive\na psychological review or comprehensive evaluation as part of the development of\nhis or her annual habilitation plan.  The annual review will consist of a review of\nprevious evaluations to determine continued validity, review of the client's chart,\nobservations of the client, report of behavioral treatment, behavioral data, comparison\nof the current service period with the previous one to determine relevant changes,\nand statements concerning a person's needs and recommendations for treatment.  If\na significant change is noted in the individual, the ID Team will request additional\ninformation  and  the  psychologist  will  provide  the  necessary  evaluations.  Full\npsychological evaluations will be completed for clients every three (3) years, or more\nfrequently  if conditions  warrant.  A full  psychological  evaluation  will  include a\nconcise description of the resident, an appropriate assessment of intellectual/cognitive\nfunctioning  and  adaptive  behavior,  assessment  of  mental  health  problems  (if\nappropriate), review of previous evaluations and comparison of the current test results\nwith previous results to determine trend, review of behavioral observations, review\nof  behavioral  procedures  and  data,  the  resident's  strengths,  needs  and  the\npsychologist's recommendations.  These evaluations will focus on the assessment of\nfunctional  skills and interests through ecological  and person-centered assessment\nprocedures.  Each assessment will  coincide with  each  client's  annual  Individual\nHabilitation Plan (IHP) schedule.\n1.  By August  1, 1995, all current and future admissions to the Special\nBehavior Unit will receive a functional assessment.  (Attachment 1). A widely\nused functional assessment tool developed by Robert Horner and colleagues,\ncalled  Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior, will  be used as a primary\nassessment guide. Other  assessment tools, such  as the Aberrant  Behavior\nChecklist, the Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults, the\nReiss  Screen, the Autism  Behavior  Checklist,  and  ecological  and  analog\nassessment strategies will also be employed as needed.\n2.  By March 1,1996, all clients receiving psychotropic medication and/or\nrestrictive behavior support plans will receive a functional assessment as part\nof their individualized behavioral support plan.  A functional analysis will be\nconducted thereafter as needed, at least on an annual basis.\n\n3.  The Director of Center Programs is developing a training curriculum\nfor the psychology  staff with specific training  in functional and ecological\nassessment and the use of this information  in the development of positive\nbehavior support plans.  A major focus for all persons will  be on teaching\nmore appropriate skills to replace challenging behaviors.  The first training\nclass is planned for August 1, 1995 and training will be completed by March\n1, 1996.\n4.  Every client for whom a behavioral need is identified or who has a\nbehavioral program will  receive a formal functional analysis as part of the\ndevelopment of a behavioral support plan by July 1, 1996.  In developing and\nassessing behavior plans, priority will be given to those individuals whose\nbehavior  places  them  at  greatest  risk.  NVTC  will  establish  priority  for\nprogram  development  for  those  residents who  exhibit  Pica,  self-injurious\nbehavior or other behavior that is dangerous to self, others, or property and\nfor those residents for whom relatively high usage of timeout and/or restraint\nis  shown  by  objective  and  reliable  data.  Such  individuals  will  receive\nfunctional  analyses which  are focused on  assessing the specific  problems\ndemonstrated  by  the  individual.  Behavioral  plans  will  be  based  upon\nobjective and reliable data and interventions documented in those plans will\nbe based upon data collected.  When appropriate, current literature will be\nconsidered in developing behavior plans.\nB.  NVTC will continue to develop and implement a professionally based training\nprogram for each client and provide each client with an adequate number of hours\nof training pursuant to applicable standards utilizing positive approaches to enable\nthe client to develop behaviors which will afford safety, freedom from undue restraint\nand other restraints on the individual's movement within and about the facility and\nto  prevent  regression  or  deterioration  of  skills.  By July  1,  1996,  each  training\nprogram will contain at a minimum:\n1.  Training  objectives  developed  by  an  appropriately  constituted\ninterdisciplinary team and based upon assessments and evaluations required\nby paragraph 1 above for those clients who have been identified as needing\nmental health services, which comport with applicable standards;\n2.  Specific  instructional  methods  to  be  utilized  by  those  with\nresponsibility for implementing the program; such methods will emphasize\npositive  approaches  and positive  behavioral  interventions  which  promote\nfunctional  skill  development  and  socially  acceptable  behaviors  for  the\nindividual client;\n3.  A specific training schedule to be followed; the number of hours of\ntraining to be provided will be sufficient to permit the client for whom the\n\nprogram has been developed to have a reasonable opportunity to reach the\nidentified behavioral  objective(s) of a training program;  no schedule will\nprovide for fewer than 40 hours of structured training or activities each week,\nunless medically contraindicated;\n4.  Procedures utilized for data collection will  be sufficient to permit a\nqualified professional to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program or\nany part thereof and to monitor the implementation of the plan and ensure its\nmodification, as necessary.  Documentation forms for tracking adaptive and\nmaladaptive behaviors have been standardized. A computerized data tracking\nsystem is being used to provide on-going functional assessment of behavior\nplans.  Graphical  representations of the data are and will  continue to be\npresented to the Behavior Management Committee (BMC) and Local Human\nRights Committee (LHRC) and are used for clinical presentations; and\n5.  Identification  of  the  persons  responsible  for  the  consistent\nimplementation of the program.\nC.  NVTC will consistently implement the training programs required in Paragraph\nB. above for all clients by July 1, 1996, and thereafter within fifteen (15) days of the\ndevelopment of the behavior plan by the ID team and full approval by the Behavior\nManagement  Committee  (BMC),  Local  Human  Rights  Committee  (LHRC)  and\nparent/guardian.  Notwithstanding this time frame, priority in the development and\nimplementation  of training  programs will  be given  to any client  exhibiting  self-\ninjurious, aggressive or pica behaviors.  Any such client will have a professionally\ndeveloped and consistently implemented training program within sixty (60) days of\nidentification of the problem.\nD.  In  order  to  afford  consistent  implementation  of  training  programs,  NVTC\nprovides and will continue to provide adequate competency-based training for all\nstaff responsible for implementing the programs specified in Paragraph B above. Staff\ntraining will focus on how to implement the programs and collect appropriate data.\nNVTC will  conduct regular periodic follow-up evaluations of staff competency  in\nimplementing programs and provide additional training, as necessary.\n1.  By June 1, 1995, center-wide Psychology Behavioral Treatment Books\nwill  be available to all psychology staff, advocate, duty officers and roving\nteam  leaders.  Also by June 30,  1995,  Unit-specific  Behavioral  Treatment\nBooks will be accessible to all unit staff as a reference for behavioral support\nplans.\n2.  Greater emphasis upon the preventive and positive procedures of the\n\"Mandt\" Training System have been included in staff orientation and during\nstaff  training  of  individualized  behavior  support  plans.  The  entire  staff\n\norientation  training  package  for  behavior  management  was  reviewed  in\nJanuary  1995 and plans and timelines for a revised training package based\nupon preventive and positive behavioral support program philosophies and\nprocedures have been established.  Implementation of the revised training\npackage is set for August 1, 1995.\nE.  NVTC has implemented and will fully maintain systems by  March 1, 1996\nfor:  (1) observing clients' behavior to determine the effectiveness of the programs\nand recording those observations;  (2) verifying the reliability of the recorded data;\nand (3) ensuring that a qualified professional reviews and appropriately modifies any\nclient's  training program when the professional  determines that the resident has\nexhibited no measurable progress for a significant period of time.\n1.  Unit-based clinical meetings will continue to occur semi-monthly to\nmonitor  clinical  issues and address changing client needs.  In the Special\nBehavior Unit (SBU), these meetings will occur weekly.\n2.  Unit-based  psychotropic  medication/behavior  plan  reviews  will\ncontinue to occur weekly on the SBU and on all other units at least monthly.\nThis  interdisciplinary  data-based  review  is  attended  by  the  psychiatrist,\nphysician,  psychologist,  psychological  assistant,  nurse,  direct  care  staff,\nprogram  manager  or  team  leader,  and  Qualified  Mental  Retardation\nProfessional  (QMRP).  Vocational  staff,  parents  and  other  pertinent\nprofessional disciplines may also attend.\n3.  Psychology staff will  perform weekly  reliability checks of treatment\nplans  using direct  observation  of  client  behavior  and  implementation  of\nbehavior  support  plans  by direct  care  staff.  Documentation  of  behavior\nsupport  plans  will  also  be  checked  for  reliability  on  a weekly  basis  by\ncomparing direct care staff and client observations with log entries, behavior\ntracking forms, and entries in the client record by March 1, 1996.\n4.  QMRP's will continue to provide program monitoring at least quarterly\nas part of the Individualized Habilitation Plan (IHP) review system.\n5.  Active treatment will continue to be formally monitored using a system\ndesigned  by  Dr.  Brian  Iwata.  Designated  and  trained  staff  will  record\nobservations at least twice a week for every unit.  (Attachment 2).  In January\n1995, a data system was established in which active treatment  information\nfrom  this  form  will  be  used  to  make  management  decisions.  The  Risk\nManager will enter the raw data and monthly reports will  be generated for\nreview by management staff.  Active treatment and other measures will  be\nintegrated  into a program monitoring  plan to be submitted to the Quality\nManagement Committee by August  1, 1995.  The results of these measures\n\nwill be compiled and distributed quarterly to all clinical and unit departments\nand to the Quality Management Committee.\nF.  NVTC will develop by January 1, 1996, a system to regularly train all direct\ncare staff in collecting and maintaining the behavioral data necessary to assess the\neffectiveness of any behavior program.  Staff will be fully trained by July 1, 1996.\nNVTC will keep written records to document such training.\nG.  An interdisciplinary team will evaluate the efficacy of the training programs\nfor each client with self-injurious, aggressive or pica behavior on a monthly basis and\nthe efficacy of the training programs for all other clients on at least a quarterly basis.\nThe team will  base its review of the efficacy of the training programs on the data\ncollected as well as the occurrence of incidents (events) and the use of restraints.  If\nthe team recommends the need to revise the training program, it will be reviewed\nand revised, if appropriate, by a psychologist within thirty (30) days.\nH.  The  Behavior  Management  Committee,  including the Director  of  Medical\nServices and, as appropriate, a psychiatrist, will review behavior plans and supporting\ndocumentation relating to each resident who:  (1) exhibits self-injurious or aggressive\nbehavior,  or  (2)  is subject  to  restrictive programming, frequent  behavior  control\nprocedures, or receives behavior modifying medication, to ascertain whether:  (i)\nthere are sufficient behavioral data recorded, (ii) such data have been assessed for\nreliability, and (iii) the continuation of the current training or treatment program is\njustified,  or  the  program,  including  medication,  should  be  modified.  Where\ninadequate  or  unreliable  data are found, or  the  continuation  of  the training  or\ntreatment  program  is otherwise  not  justified, the  matter  will  be  referred  to  the\nappropriate interdisciplinary team which shall, within 30 days of the referral, modify\nthe existing program in accordance with the judgment  of qualified  professionals,\nincluding the primary care physician, psychologist and psychiatrist, as appropriate.\nWhen in the judgment of qualified NVTC professionals, data indicates that individual\nprograms  as  implemented  have  been  ineffective  and  outside  independent\nconsultation is necessary to assist in devising an appropriate revision to the program,\nNVTC will obtain such consultation.\nII.  USE OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINT AND TIME OUT\nNVTC has developed and will continue to implement  policies and procedures to\nensure that time-out and physical restraints are administered only pursuant to the judgment\nof a qualified professional and are not used as punishment, in lieu of training programs, or\nfor  the  convenience  of  staff.  These  policies  and  procedures  are  contained  in  NVTC\nInstruction  5300  (Restrictive Procedures) and NVTC Instruction  5301  (Use of  Protective\nDevices) and the Psychology Department's Behavior Therapy Procedures:  Philosophy of\n\nUse, Definition and Staff Responsibilities.  (Attachments 3, 4, and 5).  These policies and\nprocedures will:\nA.  Protect clients from unreasonable risks to their personal safety from both the\nconduct of staff and other clients, and from unreasonable use of bodily restraints.\nB.  Provide for the use of bodily restraint and time-out only in conjunction with\na written treatment and/or training program, except in emergency circumstances. An\n\"emergency\"  is defined as \"a situation  in which a qualified professional deems a\nbehavior to be likely to cause harm to the client or others or to property unless the\nproposed intervention is immediately initiated.\"  For each emergency use of bodily\nrestraint or time-out, the decision to use the bodily  restraint or time-out must be\nmade by a qualified  professional  after considering a hierarchy  of  less restrictive\ninterventions.  Each emergency use of bodily restraint or time-out will be described\nand recorded in the client's record including the identity of the professional making\nthe decision and the justification for the decision.  A client who has been placed in\ntime-out or bodily restraints in emergency circumstances three times in the previous\nyear will be assessed and a written treatment and/or training program developed, if\nnecessary, within two weeks of the third incident, except in medical contingencies\nwhere the restraint is prescribed by a physician for short term use while the condition\nis being treated.  A standardized Crisis Management Documentation Form has been\nused since January 1994 to track emergencies and will continue to be used.\nC.  Require that, in every behavior program that utilizes bodily restraint or time-\nout, specification of:\n1.  the behavior to be eliminated and the specific behavior, clearly and\nobjectively defined, which triggers the use of the restraint or time-out;\n2.  behaviors to be taught to the client to replace the behavior that initiates\nthe use of the restraint or time-out and other programs to reduce or eliminate\nthe use of such restraint or time-out;\n3.  the restriction, i.e. type of restraint or time-out authorized and, where\napplicable, the duration of the restriction;\n4.  the professional responsible for the program and the direct care staff\nauthorized to implement the program;\n5.  the frequency and manner in which behavioral data are to be recorded\nby direct care staff.\nIn order to accomplish the above, NVTC has revised the format of all behavior\nsupport  plans  (BSPs).  A  major  emphasis  is placed  on  functional  analysis-based\n\ntreatment plans which rely upon individualized preventive and proactive behavioral\nprocedures to address challenging behaviors.  (See Attachment 6 for a sample of this\nnew format.)  A short summary of each BSP is also written to be used as a quick,\neasy reference for staff.  All behavior plans and short summaries will be rewritten\ninto this new format corresponding with the client's annual staffing. All BSPs will be\nwritten into the new format by January 31, 1996.\nD.  Require that beginning January 1,1996, any treatment and/or training program\nutilizing bodily restraint or time-out will be reviewed before implementation and at\nleast every three (3) months thereafter  by the Behavior  Management  Committee\n(BMC) as well as by the Local Human Rights Committee prior to implementation of\nthe program; provided, however, that under emergency conditions, the Chairman of\nthe BMC may approve a program not to exceed 30 days.\nE.  Prohibit the use of bodily restraint or time-out except in:  (a) those situations\nwhere  there  is written  evidence  in  the client's  record that  other,  less restrictive\ntechniques  have  been  considered  and/or  systematically  tried  and  consistently\nimplemented as part of a professionally designed training program and accurate,\nobjective  data  have  demonstrated  such  techniques  to  be  ineffective  and  (b)\nemergency situations in which there is a risk of harm to self or others.  Each time a\ndevice is used in an emergency situation or as a protective device, the client record\nmust document  that the decision to so use the device was made by a qualified\nprofessional;  it  must  identify  the  professional  making the decision,  and  it  must\ndocument  the justification  for  such  use.  Any  use of  restraint will  be the  least\nrestrictive  form  of  restraint  after  consideration  of  a hierarchy  of  less  restrictive\ninterventions.  The use of papoose boards as a form of behavioral  restraint was\neliminated as of January 18, 1992 and will not be re-implemented.  There are and\nwill be no standing medical orders for PRN psychotropic medications.\nF.  Require that appropriate psychology staff will  review  monthly each use of\nbodily restraints or time-out occurring in the previous 30 days to ascertain whether\neach  use was pursuant to the exercise of professional  judgment  or the  behavior\nprogram of the resident subject to the use.  The results of these monthly reviews,\nincluding the conclusions of the psychology staff, will be reported to the BMC every\nthree (3) months, which will  review whether a particular client needs a behavior\nprogram or whether an existing program should be modified. The BMC may initiate\nmore frequent reviews when indicated.  Restrictive measures will be continued in\nclients' programs only if reliable data supports the necessity of their continued use.\nThe BMC will record these recommendations and transmit them to appropriate staff,\nas well as NVTC management, who will be responsible for ensuring that any new\nprograms or revised programs are developed and implemented within 30 days.\n\nIII.  STAFFING  REQUIREMENTS\nNVTC will  hire, deploy, and provide ongoing training to a sufficient  number  of\ncompetent  and  qualified  direct  care  and  professional  staff  to  provide  its  clients  with\nadequate care, treatment, and training programs.\nA.  A sufficient  number of qualified  staff,  including  physicians,  psychologists,\nregistered nurses, licensed practical nurses, registered physical therapists, licensed\nphysical therapy assistants, occupational therapists, speech therapists, dietitians and\ndirect care workers will be available.  NVTC will demonstrate continuing efforts to\nachieve any additions to staff that are necessary for this purpose by January 1, 1996\nand will achieve such staffing by July 1, 1996.\nB.  NVTC will maintain adequate direct care staffing levels while implementing\nits census reduction plan referenced in Section XI.A. below.  NVTC currently meets\nan on duty direct care ratio of 1:4 on the a.m. shift, 1:5 on the p.m. shift and 1:9 at\nnight.  When the client census reaches 200 on July 1, 1996, NVTC will have and\nmaintain a campus-wide staffing ratio of 1:4,  1:4,  1:8 and will continue to deploy\nstaff based on the exercise of professional judgment to provide for the training and\nsafety needs of all clients.  NVTC will continue to provide 1:1 staffing for individuals\nwhom  qualified  professionals at the facility  have determined  are in  need of  1:1\nstaffing.\nC.  Direct care staff will not be routinely used to perform such support functions\nas housekeeping, laundry, other than client personal clothing, maintenance and meal\npreparation, etc.  This  requirement  does  not  preclude  direct  care workers  from\ntraining residents in these functions pursuant to a written training program developed\nin accordance with established procedures.\nD.  NVTC will employ sufficient senior clinical staff to afford adequate clinical\nsupervision,  case consultation,  education  and  training  of  staff  and to  afford  the\nprovision of adequate services to clients.\nE.  NVTC will continue to employ as Director of Center Programs a behaviorally\ntrained  professional  to  supervise  those  who  design  and  implement  appropriate\ntreatment,  training  and  programming  for  clients  and  sufficient  psychologists  to\ndevelop and implement all training programs and data collection and evaluation.\n1.  NVTC currently employs 5 psychologists and 6 qualified psychology\ntechnicians.  NVTC will establish and advertise for one additional psychology\nposition and fill that position by July 1, 1996.\n2.  By July 1, 1996, the overall ratio of psychology staff to clients will be\n1:34.  The psychologist assigned to the Special Behavior Unit will have a ratio\n8\n\nof 1:20 clients plus a small number of clients from Unit 1 with relatively few\nbehavioral needs.\nF.  NVTC will employ sufficient nursing staff to provide adequate nursing services\nto appropriately monitor the clients' health and medical needs.  NVTC currently has\n23 Registered Nurse positions and 4 Licensed Practical Nurse positions representing\na staffing of 14 nurses on A.M. shift, 8.5 on P.M. shift, and 4.5 on NOC shift.  The\non duty nurse to client ratio will continue to be at least 1:25 A.M. shift, 1:30 P.M.\nshift and 1:55  NOC shift.1\nG.  NVTC currently  employs three physicians who  serve as the primary care\nphysicians for the clients.  NVTC will maintain this level of staffing.  A physician is\non-site or on-call and available seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  NVTC's current\nnight call schedule is published monthly and includes home and beeper numbers.\nTwo of NVTC's physicians cover one night per week and one weekend per month\neach including Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The Medical Director covers one\nnight per week.  A family practitioner covers one night per week.  Another family\npractitioner covers two weekends per month. EMT and ER services are also available\nand located within five minutes from the Center.  NVTC will maintain a night and\non-call system, or a similar system, to meet the requirements of this plan.\nH.  NVTC will afford sufficient consultation with appropriate medical specialists\nincluding  psychiatrists, neurologists, orthopedists and a physiatrist and otherwise\nprovide services to clients as may be needed to provide adequate care and treatment.\n(See Attachment 7.)\n1.  NVTC will continue to contract for the on-site services of a psychiatrist\n2 full days per week (at least 6 1/2 hours per day) plus a psychiatric fellow\napproximately one day per week.\n2.  In addition to off-site services, NVTC will continue to contract for the\non-site services of a physiatrist at least quarterly, an orthopedist quarterly, and\na neurologist 2 full days per month. (Full days may be reduced to partial days\nif  and  when  patient  needs  allow.)  NVTC  will  also  continue  periodic\nconsultation with a geneticist for diagnostic purposes.\nI.  By July 1, 1995, NVTC will hire three (3) full time additional physical therapy\npositions with the goal of filling these positions by July  1, 1996.  These positions\ninclude one licensed physical therapist and two physical therapist assistants, bringing\nthe total physical therapy positions at NVTC to 3 registered physical therapists and\n:Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent NVTC in the exercise of its own\ndiscretion, from deploying a greater proportion of nursing staff than is required by this Plan.\n\n3 licensed physical therapy assistants.  This will bring the ratio of physical therapists\nas of July 1, 1996 to  1:34.\nJ.  By July  1,  1995,  NVTC  will  establish  and  advertise  for  one  additional\nregistered  occupational  therapist  position  and  3 certified  occupational  therapist\nassistant positions.  NVTC's goal is to fill these positions by July 1, 1996.  This will\nbring the total  number of funded  OT positions to  7.  The ratio of  occupational\ntherapists to clients as of July 1, 1996 will be 1:29.\nK.  By July 1,1995, NVTC will establish 1.5 additional dietitian positions bringing\nthe total number of dietitian positions to 2.5.  NVTC's goal is to fill these positions\nby July 1, 1996.\nIV.  STAFF TRAINING\nAll  staff  who  provide  services  to  NVTC  clients  are adequately  trained  to  fully\nimplement the requirements of this Plan and are thereafter provided with in-service training\non a regular basis.  The training will  be competency-based and will  include, but not be\nlimited to:  behavior management techniques; implementation of individualized treatment\nand training  programs; emergency  medical  response, including  recordkeeping for  such\nprocedures.\nA.  Pre-Service Training\n1.  All new employees of NVTC will continue to be required to attend a\nbasic  orientation  program  within  the  first  30  days  of  employment  and\nsuccessfully complete all components before the end of their  probationary\nperiod. This orientation provides basic information in the following mandated\nsubject areas: Personnel Policies, Orientation to NVTC, Abuse Policy, Human\nRights Regulations, Safety and Security Procedures, Infection Control/AIDS,\nNormalization, Introduction to Mental Retardation, Seizures, First Aid, Body\nMechanics and Lifting, and Sexual Harassment.\n2.  NVTC will continue to require NVTC direct care staff to successfully\ncomplete  additional  training  as  part  of  their  orientation  training,  and a\ncompetency-based  training  program  at  their  worksite.  (Attachment  8).\nCoursework will  concentrate on additional  health/nursing  information and\nemergency  procedures,  behavior  management  techniques,  appropriate\ninteractions  and  teaching  techniques,  specific  clinical  information  and\nstrategies  necessary  to  be  able  to  implement  individual  programs,  and\ndocumentation and data collection. The orientation program will also include\nActive Treatment, Behavioral Documentation, Use of Mechanical Restraints,\nAdult CPR, Side Effects of Medications, and the Mandt System for Managing\n10\n\nPeople.  (Attachment 9).  Most of the orientation sessions in the clinical areas\nwill continue to be competency-based (tests, return demonstrations, etc.).  In\naddition, there is a final written exam.  Staff who are unable to demonstrate\ncompetency are terminated from employment.  In keeping with NVTC's goal\nto share resources with the community, the orientation program will continue\nto be offered to all of the local community agencies who frequently attend\nsessions and comment  on the quality  of the training their  staff receive at\nNVTC.\n3.  Training in the Mandt System will continue to be a component of the\nstaff development program and will focus on all interactions between people.\nThe  major  emphasis of the  program  is on  non-physical  interventions.  It\nstresses the need to interact appropriately at all times in an effort to prevent\nindividuals from becoming upset.  All direct care staff receive the two-day\nIntermediate  Level  of  training  in  pre-service.  An  annual  one-day\nrecertification is also required.\n4.  All  staff development  programs will  continue to emphasize several\nmajor  themes  which  support  the  Mission  Statement  of  the  agency:\nappropriate staff to client interactions (treatment with dignity and respect), and\nthe need to encourage and teach client independence.  The importance of\nproviding  an  environment  which  is  supportive,  protective,  encouraging,\nreinforcing,  and  proactive  is  included  throughout  the  entire  orientation\nprogram.\n5.  NVTC has developed and will  continue to use a competency-based\ntraining program for new employees which is utilized at the work site once\nthe employee has successfully completed the orientation portion of the pre-\nservice program.  The Direct Care Competency Training Program (DCCTP)\nprovides  opportunities  for  new  staff  to  demonstrate  to  their  supervisors\ncompetence in all aspects of their job responsibilities.  (Attachment 10).  The\nDCCTP  includes  sections  on  Philosophy,  Personal  Care/Health/Hygiene,\nActive Treatment, Documentation, and Policy.  Sections on  Understanding\nBasic Behavior Intervention Programs and Program Implementation have been\nadded  to  the  Active  Treatment  portion  of  the  original  program.  New\nemployees continue to have six months (the remainder of their probationary\nperiod) to complete the program. Accompanying the DCCTP is a competency\nbook  of  50  task  analyzed  job  duties  in  providing  health  related  care,\nstaff/client  interactions,  provide/maintain  a safe  living  area,  and  how  to\nimplement program plans.\n6.  Compliance  with  the  completion  requirements  for  the  Pre-service\nprogram  and  DCCTP  will  continue  to  be  monitored  by  the  Training\nDepartment.  Notices are sent to supervisors monthly advising them of staff\n11\n\n\n\n2.  In addition to Adult CPR, NVTC will continue to conduct emergency\nmedical response drills.  (Attachment 13).  The purpose of these drills is to\nallow  all  staff  involved  the  opportunity  to  practice  responding to  mock\nmedical emergencies to better prepare them for a real situation.  Nursing staff\ncoordinate, monitor, and evaluate these drills and send documentation to the\nTraining Department.\n3.  Compliance with mandated training requirements will be monitored by\nthe Training  Department.  Quarterly  summaries  of compliance  rates with\nmandated training requirements are sent to the supervisors.\n4.  NVTC's curriculum on Client Record System and Documentation has\nbeen developed and will continue to be included in the Annual Retraining\nProgram.  Target date for implementation was June 30, 1995.\n5.  Recognizing that the skills and knowledge necessary for direct care staff\nassigned to different work sites will vary depending upon the specific needs\nof the clients,  program  managers are in the  process of working  with  the\nTraining Department to determine additional training requirements for direct\ncare staff assigned to each unit.  Building 7 began this pilot in late 1994 and\nbegan  implementing  its  plan  in  January  1995.  (See Attachment  14  for\nBuilding  7 Plan).  All  residential  buildings  will  have completed  plans by\nSeptember 30, 1995.\nC.  Physical Management Training\nTraining the Physical Management curriculum \"Challenges in Physical\nManagement\", as described in Pre-service Training, Paragraph A.9 above, will\nbegin for direct care and clinical staff by January 31,1996.  Staff assigned to\nUnits 1, 3A, 3C, 3D, and 5A will participate in more intense in-services and\nclient specific training at their work sites.  These in-services will be provided\nquarterly at a minimum. Whenever an individual client program is developed\nor modified, all staff will be trained on these changes.\nD.  Individual Behavioral Programming Training\n1.  During  pre-service, staff receive training on  Behavior  Modification,\nTeaching  Techniques  (Task  Analysis,  Prompting,  Reinforcement,  Error\nCorrection),  Crisis  Management,  Behavioral  Documentation,  and  Use  of\nMechanical  Restraints. This training  is meant to  be general  in nature and\nprovide staff with the \"tools\" to be able to implement individualized program\nplans.  However, staff are not permitted to implement program plans until\nthey have received additional training on the individual plans.\n13\n\n2.  Once  an  employee  completes  the  pre-service  program,  he or she\nbegins working on the assigned work site.  If clients on the unit have behavior\nprograms, the new staff member is not allowed to implement them until he\nor she has been properly trained by the psychologist or psychology assistant.\nThe psychology staff will monitor the training of each new staff member in all\naspects of the program (including the specific target behavior, the objective,\nhow to prevent the behavior from occurring, what to do when the targeted\nbehavior  is displayed, the adaptive and reinforcement  components of the\nprogram, and data collection requirements).  NVTC policy also requires that\nstaff be re-trained on all behavior programs whenever there are changes to the\nprogram  or  every  six  months,  whichever  comes  first.  This  training  is\ndocumented and forwarded to the Training Department for inclusion in each\nemployee's training record.\n3.  As new behavior support plans are written and summarized on new\nforms (Client Behavior Profiles), as described in Section II.C above, these will\nbecome a quick study guide and training tool for staff.  Completion date is\nJanuary 31, 1996.\n4.  To  further  develop  the  knowledge  of  staff  regarding  behavioral\nprinciples,  all  direct  care  staff  will  be  required  to  complete  the  \"Basic\nBehavioral Principles and their Applications to People with  Developmental\nDisabilities\" software package previously mentioned  in the section on Pre-\nservice Training.  The completion date for this training for Units 5C, 6, 7C,\n8A, and 8C is October 31, 1995, and for Units 1, 3A, 3C, 3D, 5A, and 7A is\nJune 30, 1996.\nE.  Feeding/Mealtime Training\n1.  The Training  Department  has begun  providing  and  will  continue  to\nprovide in-services on Active Treatment focusing on the mealtime activity.\nThis training stresses the importance of implementing individual  goals and\nobjectives from the I HP into the meal experience.  Staff are quizzed on their\nknowledge  of  individual  client  programs,  followed  by  discussion  and\ndemonstration of how these client needs can be integrated and implemented\nbefore, during, and after each mealtime.  NVTC has completed training on\nUnits  1, 3D, 5A, 5C, 6, and  7A.  Units 3C and  7C are scheduled to be\ncompleted by February 1, 1996.  3A will be completed by March 1, 1996, 8A\nby April 1, 1996 and 8C by May 1, 1996. All active treatment training will be\ncomplete by May 1, 1996.\n2.  A concentrated interdisciplinary effort around several mealtime issues\nwas begun in the Fall of 1994.  The goal is to create a mealtime environment\nand experience which  is more normalizing and more enriching, as well as\n14\n\ntherapeutic  in  nature.  This  is  accomplished  by  evaluating  the  physical\nenvironment  of  the  dining  areas,  the  time  and  resources  allocated  to\nmealtimes, and the knowledge of staff in mealtime programs and issues of\nactive treatment.  Clinical staff have established days and times to be in the\ndining  areas to assist, model, and provide  feedback  to  staff on  mealtime\ntechniques and program implementation.  This will continue on an on-going\nbasis.  Monitoring  is to  be done  by  building  supervisory  staff.  Specific\noutcome  measures  will  be  established  by  the  clinical  departments,  in\nconjunction with the I.D. Team, for each specific unit by October 31, 1995.\n3.  As client programs are developed and modified, direct care staff will\ncontinue to be trained in these individual program plans by the appropriate\nclinical  staff.  Such  reviews  are  documented  and  become  part  of  the\nemployee's training record.  Clinical staff regularly and periodically review\ngeneral information as well as client-specific information with the staff.  This\nis documented and forwarded to the Training Department for inclusion in the\nemployee's training record.\n4.  NVTC has purchased a tutorial software package on Active Treatment\nwhich will be included in the pre-service program.  All direct care staff will\ncomplete the tutorial by July 1, 1996.\nF.  Continuing Education for Professional Staff\n1.  NVTC has established minimum continuing education requirements for\nits clinical staff.  (Attachment  15).  These were established for professional\npositions  for  which  there  are  no  state  mandated  or  licensing  continuing\neducation  requirements.  These  were  established  by  the  appropriate\ndepartment heads and were based on standards from other states.  Clinical\nstaff  who  attend  a  training  event  which  meets  a  continuing  education\nrequirement send documentation of this to the Training Department and it is\nentered into their training record.  Summaries of training are provided to the\nsupervisors and employees upon request.  This continuing education process\nwill be ongoing.\n2.  Records  will  be  kept  on  compliance  with  required  continuing\neducation  and reported back to supervisors and the Quality  Management\nCommittee on a quarterly basis.  Reports will begin with training completed\nby December 31, 1995.\n15\n\nV.  PHYSICAL THERAPY AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY  MANAGEMENT\nNVTCwill provide clients with adequate physical management, including appropriate\nphysical therapy and occupational therapy programs.  In addition to staffing outlined  in\nSection III, J and K, NVTC shall take the following steps to accomplish this:\nA.  Physical Therapy\n1.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will design and provide new wheelchairs\nand seating systems to 32 residents.  (Attachments 16 and 18).\n2.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will design and fit 19 new seating systems\ninto current wheelchairs.\n3.  By  December  31,  1996,  NVTC  will  upgrade  and/or  replace  the\nremaining third  of  individual  wheelchairs.  Provision  of wheelchairs  and\nwheelchair  modifications will  be based upon a professional assessment of\nthose most in need; all adaptive equipment will be individualized and there\nwill  be  a  continual  adaptation  of  wheelchairs  and  other  equipment  as\nindividual needs change.  (Attachments 16 and 18).\n4.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will develop and staff an on-site workshop\ndedicated to wheelchair and positioning equipment.\n5.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will complete modifications to the water\nheating system for the Hubbard Tank to permit staff to conduct hydrotherapy\nduring cold weather months.\n6.  By  June  30,  1996,  NVTC  will  reevaluate  all  clients  with  fixed\ncontractures and reassess their potential for improvement with  consultation\nfrom orthopedic and physiatric consultants.\n7.  By June 30, 1995, NVTC will establish 24-hour positioning schedules\nfor ail clients in need of positioning on Unit  1 and Building 3:\na.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will  begin taking photographs of\nclients in various positions, with accompanying written descriptions of\nthe benefits of placement in each position.  These photographs will be\nassembled in unit-based books for daily use.\nb.  By April 30, 1995, NVTC will implement completed positioning\nprograms in Unit 1.\n16\n\nc.  By June 30, 1995, NVTC will implement completed positioning\nprograms in Building 3.\n8.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will establish and implement a staff training\ncourse  for  physical  management  of  clients  who  demonstrate  challenging\nmealtime and positioning needs.\n9.  By July  1, 1995, NVTC will  select a physical  management training\nprogram following review of several physical management training packages\nby the Training Department, Director of Occupational Therapy, Director of\nPhysical Therapy and Director of Center Programs.\n10.  By July 1,1996, physical management training will become part of pre-\nservice orientation for all new staff and yearly re-training will also be required.\nB.  Occupational Therapy\n1.  A new Director of Occupational Therapy Services was hired on July\n18,  1994.  The Director will  not serve as program manager ior any other\nBuilding or Unit at NVTC.\n2.  By December 31, 1995, NVTC will be established as an internship site\nfor students in occupational therapy professional training programs.\n3.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will complete a pilot project involving sensory-\nmotor integration training/treatment for four clients.  Data will be collected\nand assessed. If data shows positive benefits for clients, the training/treatment\nprogram  will  be  implemented  with  other  clients  whose  need  for  such\ntraining/treatment has been identified by professional staff.\nVI.  NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT AND FEEDING\nNVTC will provide clients with adequate nourishment, identification of nutritional\ndeficiencies and appropriate feeding programs and adaptive equipment for use at mealtimes.\nNVTC will take the following steps to accomplish this:\nA.  By April  1, 1995, NVTC developed and began  pilot  implementation  of a\nNutritional Risk Assessment Form.\n1.  Pilot  testing,  modification  and  refinement  of  the  Nutritional  Risk\nAssessment Form will be completed by December 31, 1995.\n17\n\n2.  A Nutritional Risk Screening Assessment form has been completed for\neach  resident  determined  by  staff  to  have  specialized  nutritional  and/or\nfeeding needs, and such a form will be completed for each resident identified\nin the future with a specialized need.  Training appropriate to the resident's\nneeds, based upon nutritional risk assessment, will be conducted for all staff\nmembers having nutritional responsibility and/or feeding responsibilities with\nrespect to the resident.  It is understood that staff working with residents with\nthe highest risk will be the first to receive the training.\nB.  By July 1, 1995, NVTC will  establish one and one-half additional  dietitian\npositions.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC shall have on staff two and one-half Registered\nDietitians.\nC.  By September 1, 1995, NVTC will have provided consultation to direct care\nand professional staff on Units 1 and Building 3 by a multi-disciplinary  nutritional\nmanagement team, including an occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech\npathologist and dietitian.  (Attachments 17 and 18).\nD.  By December 31,1995, NVTC will receive equipment designated as needed\nto implement modifications identified by nutritional assessments.  Items will include\none weighing scale, specialized calipers to assess nutritional status and measuring\nboards.\nE.  By December 31, 1995, NVTC will purchase the adaptive equipment for use\nduring  meals  which  has  been  identified  as  needed  by  physical  therapy  and\noccupational therapy staff.  (Attachments 16 and 18).\nF.  By July 1, 1995, NVTC will receive 30 dining room chairs and accompanying\ntables for mealtime use on Building 3.\nG.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will install a dishwasher in the Building 3 dining\nroom, so all adaptive equipment can be cleaned on-site.\nH.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will install an answering machine in Dietary the\nServices office to permit units to report, at ail hours, adaptive feeding equipment\nneeds.\nI.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will provide for diagrams and photographs of residents\nto be placed in the dining room next to each resident.\n18\n\nVII.  MEDICAL CARE\nResidents will be provided with adequate medical care.  In order to accomplish this,\nNVTC will:\nA.  Quality Assurance\nImplement a peer review  mechanism for all disciplines  involved  in\nproviding health services. The Quality Assurance Program for Health Services\n(Attachment  19)  provides  for  systematic  credentialing  procedures,  staff\neducation,  reviews of  adverse events or  outcomes  by  a Clinical  Practice\nReview  Committee,  as well  as for  peer  review  for  medical  and  nursing\npractitioners.\na.  Medical peer review was initiated on November 4, 1994 and\nthe process of this review will continue, with systemic refinements, as\nneeded.\nb.  NVTC's  medical  director  will  serve  on  a committee  which\nincludes the Director of Resident Records in order to develop a system\nfor monitoring and improving physician documentation in charts. This\nreview and planning period will be completed by September 1, 1995.\nB.  Medical Specialty Consultation\nNVTC  maintains  a  regular  schedule  of  consultation  with  medical\nspecialists.  (See Attachment 7.)  These include neurology, ENT, orthopedics,\nophthalmology,  psychiatry,  physiatry,  gastro-intestinal,  podiatry,  urology,\ncardiology, gynecology, dermatology and genetics. Recruitment for additional\nspecialty medical consultants will continue, as needs are identified.  Notes\nfrom these consultations will continue to be included in residents' records and\na procedure for monitoring will be established by September 30, 1995.  See\nalso Section IX.  Recordkeeping Section.\nC.  Medical Management of Residents with Epilepsy\n1.  An interdisciplinary epilepsy committee developed and implemented\na  new  charting  system  for  the  epilepsy  clinic.  (See  Attachment  20.)\nInformation  from this charting will  be incorporated  into the new  resident\nrecord system by March 30, 1995.  A procedure for monitoring compliance\nwith the requirement of inclusion of charting information into resident records\nwill be established by September 30, 1995.\n19\n\n2.  By  December  31, 1995,  semi-annual  audits  of  antiepileptic  drug\nprescribing practices will  be conducted by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics\nCommittee,  which  performs  the  functions  of  a  drug  utilization  review\ncommittee.  Information  from  these  audits  will  be  considered  by  the\ninterdisciplinary  epilepsy  committee  and  will  submitted  to  the  Quality\nManagement Director.  Appropriate monitoring and follow-up will occur, as\nnecessary.\na.  NVTC will emphasize use of monotherapy and deemphasize\nuse of barbiturates and phenytoin.\nb.  The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will  continue to\nmonitor the consistency of charting and medication adjustment/change\nin individuals with epilepsy and seizures.\nc.  One  index  of  improved  quality  of  life  for  clients  receiving\nepileptic  drugs  has been  identified  as reduced  use of  helmets  for\nclients with  epilepsy.  Monitoring  of  frequency  of  helmet  use has\nshown a reduction of 38% in the use of helmets from 45 in 1989 to\n28 in February,  1995.  NVTC will  rely upon controlled  medication\ntrials and ongoing monitoring of  improvement  to determine further\nappropriate reduction of helmet use.  (Attachment 4).\n3.  Individual  treatment  protocols  for  status  epilepticus  will  be\nimplemented by September 30, 1995.\n4.  A  videotape  and  brochures  for  staff  and  family  education  will  be\ncompleted by the interdisciplinary epilepsy committee by October 30, 1995.\n5.  Beginning June 30, 1995, the interdisciplinary epilepsy committee will\nreview  epilepsy-related  injuries,  infirmary  and  hospital  admissions  on  a\nquarterly basis and report its analysis of this data to the Quality Management\nDirector.\n6.  Guidelines were developed in September,  1994 for nursing care of\nclients  with  seizures and for  first aid  by  residential  staff.  Guidelines  for\nresidential staff were posted in October,  1994.  (Attachment 21).\nCompliance with these guidelines will be assessed through routine audits of\nindividual charts by a procedure to be established by September 30, 1995.\n20\n\nD.  Emergency Responsiveness\n1.  Monthly emergency responsiveness drills, involving nursing, security\nand residential staff, were begun in May, 1994.  (Attachment 22).  The nurse\nmanager will  monitor the monthly drill reports and forward the analysis of\nthese results and  recommendations  to the Quality  Management  Director,\nbeginning on September 30, 1995.\n2.  Documentation of response times of EMS personnel to 911 calls from\nNVTC and of NVTC nurses to on-campus emergencies was begun in May\n1994.  (Attachment 23).  The nurse manager will monitor the response times\nof  EMS  and  nursing  staff  members  and  will  report  the  results  of  this\nmonitoring to the Quality Management Director, beginning on June 30,1995.\n3.  Emergency notification procedures were posted on residential units in\nOctober, 1994. (Attachments 24 and 25). Compliance with these procedures\nwill be monitored by the nurse manager through chart audits, and compliance\nrates  gathered  from  this  monitoring  will  be  submitted  to  the  Quality\nManagement Director, beginning on September 30, 1995.\nVIII.  MEDICATION MANAGEMENT\nBeginning December 1, 1995, a semi-annual audit of psychotropic medication\nprescribing  practices  will  be  conducted  by  the  Pharmacy  and  Therapeutics\nCommittee, which performs the function of a drug utilization review committee, with\nthe  results  of  these  audits  transmitted  to  the  Quality  Management  Director.\nAppropriate monitoring and follow-up will occur, as necessary.\n1.  Since mid-1989, NVTC's use of antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs has\nbeen reduced by 33%.  As of December 31, 1994, 26 clients were receiving\nthis class of drugs, in comparison with  39 residents five years previously.\n(Attachment 26).\n2.  The Dyskinesia Identification System: Condensed User Scale (DISCUS)\nwas adopted for monitoring tardive dyskinesia and other side-effects of clients\non psychotropic medications in August, 1993.  (Attachment 27).  Information\nfrom  this  instrument  will  be  reviewed  quarterly  by  the  Pharmacy  and\nTherapeutics  Committee  beginning  in June,  1995.  Information  from this\nreview will be submitted to the Quality Management  Director.\n3.  The consulting psychiatrist and Medical Director will continue to serve\nas members of the Behavioral Management Committee.\n21\n\n4.  NVTC will  follow  its policies and procedures  regarding the use of\npsychotropic  medication,  e.g.  NVTC  Instruction  5302  on  Psychotropic\nMedication (Attachment 28), Medical Plan for Psychotropic Drug Use, consent\nforms (Attachment 29) and Health Services Policy and Procedures (Attachment\n30).\nIX.  RECORDKEEPING\nNVTC will develop and implement a system of records for each client, developed\nand  maintained  under  the  supervision  of  a  qualified  professional  whose  primary\nresponsibility  will  be to properly  maintain  client  records.  Each record will  be readily\navailable to all staff and will contain current information with respect to the client's care,\nmedical treatment, and training, and will  be organized so as to enable those using it to\nrender  professional judgments  in providing care, medical treatment, and training to the\nclient.  NVTC will require staff to utilize such records in making care, medical treatment,\nand training decisions.\nNVTC has approved for implementation a new Client Records System, the \"Source\nOriented Medical Record with Integrated Progress Notes\".  Revision of the record system\nhas been divided  into five phases:  I.  Recruitment;  II. Research and Development; III.\nTraining; IV. Implementation, and V.  Quality Management. Timetables for each section are\noutlined in Attachment 31.  Phases I and II have been completed.  NVTC's plan provides\nfor:\nA.  Recruitment of a qualified Health Information Manager.  A new Director of\nResident  Records,  was  hired  on  August  22,  1994.  This  position  will  oversee\nimplementation of the new client records system in 1995.\nB.  Development of a new Client Records System:  Following three months of\nreviewing  the  current  records  management  system, site visits  to  other  facilities,\nsolicitation of input from facility staff and researching recordkeeping techniques, a\nnew client record system was proposed.  In November and December  1994, the\nproposal  was  presented  to  Resident  Record  Committee  members,  clinical  and\nresidential  staff and Senior  Staff.  On  December  20,  1994, the Source Oriented\nMedical Record with Integrated Progress notes was approved for use beginning June\n30, 1995.  Attachment 32 summarizes the system which has been accepted.\nC.  The most significant change represented by the new client record system is\nthe integrated progress note, \"Interdisciplinary  Note\", section.  In this centralized\nsection, professional disciplines will be charting information pertaining to the client.\n(Attachment 33).  Specific documentation instruction to staff include guidelines for\nall those making entries into the centralized progress notes and contain \"prompts\" for\n22\n\nentry  of  indicators  such  as  \"OT  Monthly  Notes\"  as a title  (qualifier)  for  easy\nidentification and review.\nD.  Training:  Beginning in March, 1995, Medical Records staff, in conjunction\nwith the Training Department, will begin training in the new records system.  Small\ndepartmental groups have been targeted for individualized training.  Training will\nrequire each staff member to convert an existing client record to the format created\nby the new  records system.  Instructional  guides will  be provided for  each staff\nmember.  Training for all residential and clinical staff will be completed by June 30,\n1995.  Follow-up sessions will be scheduled, as needed.\nE.  Implementation:  Since  records  will  be  revised  during  training  sessions,\nfacility-wide implementation of the new records system will be completed by June\n30, 1995.\nF.  Quality Management: By June 30,1995, the current Resident Records Quality\nManagement Plan will be amended to include quality mechanisms for  monitoring\nimplementation of the new system.  Amendments will include provisions for:\n1.  Establishing  a  random  sampling  of  records  from  each  unit  for\ncompliance review by the Medical Record department staff and members of\nthe Resident Record Committee.\n2.  Completion  of  initial  reviews  for  all  units  will  be  completed  by\nSeptember 30, 1995 and a schedule for ongoing reviews of compliance with\nrequirements of the new system.\n3.  Establishing criteria for monitoring which include, at a minimum:\na.  correct chart identification on each CRS;\nb.  correct record filing order;\nc.  correct chronological date order for documents;\nd.  entries made to the integrated progress notes which are prefaced\nwith qualifiers stating the discipline documenting the note; and\ne.  correct use of double-sided progress notes.\n4.  Reporting results of each random sampling on a quarterly basis to the\nQuality Management Committee and the facility Resident Records Committee.\n23\n\nX.  QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN\nNVTC will  develop  and annually  update  a Quality  Management  Plan  that  will\nmonitor, document and evaluate implementation of the activities  identified  in this Plan.\nAttachment 34 is NVTC's Quality Management Plan for FY 94-95.\nXI.  COMMUNITY PLACEMENT\nA.  NVTC will reduce the number of current clients at NVTC in accordance with\nthe NVTC Community  Integration  Initiative developed  in  1991 with the primary\nobjective of reducing current (i.e. 1991) resident census from 270 to 200 persons.\nThis will be accomplished by securing appropriate community-based placements for\nthose clients it determines in accordance with professional judgment to be eligible\nand appropriate  for such placement, subject to the procedures described  in  1 C\nbelow.  Full implementation of the Community Initiative will occur by July 1, 1996.\nAttached is a description of the Community Initiative outlining timelines employed,\nschedule for continued downsizing, and the process that has been used and will be\nused to meet its objectives.  (Attachment 35).\nB.  NVTC will annually assess the needs of all remaining residents at NVTC as\nfollows:\n1.  The  treatment  team  will  annually  assess  in  accordance  with  the\nexercise of professional judgment the needs of all residents at NVTC at the\ntime of the development  of the annual  IHP to  render an evaluation  with\nrespect  to  the  appropriateness  of  continued  placement  at  NVTC.  Such\nassessments will  occur  more  frequently  if  a change  in  the  needs  of  the\nresident so indicates.\n2.  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  9, 4,  if  all  appropriate  professionals\nemployed by or under contract with the Commonwealth to assess a resident,\nincluding but not necessarily limited to the assigned interdisciplinary team,\ndetermine that NVTC is not an appropriate setting for a resident and that a\nresident  would  be  more  appropriately  served  in  a  community  setting,\nappropriate professionals will, within a reasonable time thereafter, develop\nsuch plan as may be appropriate and feasible to provide necessary services to\nthe resident in a community setting, and will place the resident in accordance\nwith the plan within a reasonable time after such plan has been developed\nand can be feasibly implemented.  Sound, prudent fiscal considerations, and\ngenerally accepted business practices may be used by NVTC in determining\nwhether a plan to place a resident in the community  is feasible and, if so,\nwhen such plan can be feasibly implemented.  In no event will NVTC have\nan obligation  under  the Plan to discharge or  transfer  a resident  before a\n24\n\ncommunity setting that would more appropriately serve the resident has been\nidentified and there is such a setting available.\n3.  In all decisions with  respect to  individual  residents, the views and\nopinions of the individual resident, parent(s), guardian(s), other appropriate\nsurrogate decision-maker(s) and professionals will be appropriately considered\nby NVTC.  When it is determined that NVTC is not an appropriate setting for\na resident, NVTC will ensure that the views and opinions of the individual\nresident, parent(s), guardian(s), appropriate surrogate decision-maker(s) and\nprofessionals  will  be considered  when  developing  and  implementing an\nappropriate and feasible discharge plan.\n4.  Where the consent of parent(s), guardian(s), or other surrogate decision-\nmaker(s) is withheld regarding discharge or placement, in disagreement with\nthe  judgment  of  professionals  employed  by  or  under  contract  with  the\nCommonwealth, NVTC will  make its discharge and transfer decisions after\nconsultation  with  the  individual  resident,  parent(s),  guardian(s)  or  other\nappropriate  surrogate  decision-maker(s)  and, after  such  consultation,  will\nengage in a good faith effort to reach a consensus as to what decision about\ndischarge and/or placement is in the best interests of the individual  NVTC\nresident in exercise of its discretion on a case-by-case basis.  The parent(s),\nguardian(s) or other surrogate decision-maker(s) may present the opinion of a\nqualified professional(s) for consideration by NVTC with respect to discharge\nand/or placement decisions.  If the NVTC decision is ultimately to retain the\nresident, NVTC will continue to involve the parent(s), guardian(s) or other\nsurrogate decision-maker(s) in the treatment and discharge planning process\nand continue to make them aware of available opportunities in the community\nfor  the  care  of  the  resident  through  parental  educational  opportunities\nconducted by community providers.\ne:\\kbc\\cripa\\nvtc.cln\n25\n\nNORTHERN VIRGINIA  TRAINING  CENTER\nCASE NO. 96-283-A\n\nEXHIBIT\nA\nCommonwealth of Virginia\nDepartment of Mental  Health, Mental  Retardation\nand Substance Abuse Services\nNORTHERN VIRGINIA  TRAINING  CENTER\nPLAN\nAs revised through\nJune 27, 1996\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nPreface to the Plan  ii\nI.

The Plan is incorporated by reference into\nthe Settlement Agreement executed by the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States\nof America, and is subject to the terms thereof.\n\nI.  DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAINING PROGRAMS UTILIZING\nPOSITIVE TRAINING TECHNIQUES\nNVTC  provides  training  programs  developed  by  qualified  professionals  utilizing\npositive  training  techniques  designed  to  afford  skill  development,  personal  safety  and\nreasonable use of restraints and prevent  regression of residents.  In order to accomplish\nthese programs, NVTC will:\nA.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will professionally evaluate and/or re-evaluate each\nresident using multi-disciplinary evaluations, as needed. Each individual will receive\na psychological review or comprehensive evaluation as part of the development of\nhis or her annual habilitation plan.  The annual review will consist of a review of\nprevious evaluations to determine continued validity, review of the client's chart,\nobservations of the cl ient, report of behavioral treatment, behavioral data, comparison\nof the current service period with the previous one to determine relevant changes,\nand statements concerning a person's needs and recommendations for treatment.  If\na significant change is noted in the individual, the ID Team will request additional\ninformation  and  the  psychologist  will  provide  the  necessary  evaluations.  Full\npsychological evaluations will be completed for clients every three (3) years, or more\nfrequently  if conditions  warrant.  A full  psychological  evaluation  will  include a\nconcise description of the resident, an appropriate assessment of intellectual/cognitive\nfunctioning  and  adaptive  behavior,  assessment  of  mental  health  problems  (if\nappropriate), review of previous evaluations and comparison of the current test results\nwith previous results to determine trend, review of behavioral observations, review\nof  behavioral  procedures  and  data,  the  resident's  strengths,  needs  and  the\npsychologist's recommendations.  These evaluations will focus on the assessment of\nfunctional  skills and interests through ecological  and person-centered  assessment\nprocedures.  Each assessment will  coincide with  each client's  annual  Individual\nHabilitation Plan (IHP) schedule.\n1.  By August 1, 1995, all current and future admissions to the Special\nBehavior Unit will receive a functional assessment.  (Attachment 1). A widely\nused functional assessment tool developed by Robert Horner and colleagues,\ncalled Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior, will  be used as a primary\nassessment  guide. Other  assessment tools, such as the Aberrant  Behavior\nChecklist, the Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults, the\nReiss  Screen, the  Autism  Behavior  Checklist,  and  ecological  and  analog\nassessment strategies will also be employed as needed.\n2.  By March 1,1996, all clients receiving psychotropic medication and/or\nrestrictive behavior support plans will receive a functional assessment as part\nof their individualized behavioral support plan.  A functional analysis will be\nconducted thereafter as needed, at least on an annual basis.\n\n3.  The Director of Center Programs is developing a training curriculum\nfor the psychology  staff with  specific training in functional  and  ecological\nassessment and the use of this information  in the development  of  positive\nbehavior support plans.  A major focus for all persons will  be on teaching\nmore appropriate skills to replace challenging behaviors.  The first training\nclass is planned for August 1, 1995 and training will be completed by March\n1, 1996.\n4.  Every client for whom a behavioral need is identified or who  has a\nbehavioral  program will  receive a formal functional  analysis as part of the\ndevelopment of a behavioral support plan by July 1, 1996.  In developing and\nassessing behavior  plans, priority will  be given to those individuals whose\nbehavior  places  them  at  greatest  risk.  NVTC  will  establish  priority  for\nprogram  development  for  those  residents  who  exhibit  Pica,  self-injurious\nbehavior or other behavior that is dangerous to self, others, or property and\nfor those residents for whom relatively high usage of time-out and/or restraint\nis  shown  by  objective  and  reliable  data.  Such  individuals  will  receive\nfunctional  analyses which  are focused  on assessing the specific  problems\ndemonstrated  by  the  individual.  Behavioral  plans  will  be  based  upon\nobjective and reliable data and interventions documented in those plans will\nbe based upon data collected.  When appropriate, current literature will be\nconsidered in developing behavior plans.\nB.  NVTC will continue to develop and implement a professionally based training\nprogram for each client and provide each client with an adequate number of hours\nof training pursuant to applicable standards utilizing positive approaches to enable\nthe client to develop behaviors which will afford safety, freedom from undue restraint\nand other restraints on the individual's movement within and about the facility and\nto  prevent  regression  or  deterioration  of  skills.  By July  1, 1996,  each  training\nprogram will contain at a minimum:\n1.  Training  objectives  developed  by  an  appropriately  constituted\ninterdisciplinary team and based upon assessments and evaluations required\nby paragraph 1 above for those clients who have been identified as needing\nmental health services, which comport with applicable standards;\n2.  Specific  instructional  methods  to  be  utilized  by  those  with\nresponsibility for implementing the program; such methods will  emphasize\npositive  approaches  and  positive  behavioral  interventions  which  promote\nfunctional  skill  development  and  socially  acceptable  behaviors  for  the\nindividual client;\n3.  A specific training schedule to be followed; the number of hours of\ntraining to be provided will be sufficient to permit the client for whom the\n\nprogram has been developed to have a reasonable opportunity to reach the\nidentified  behavioral  objective(s)  of a training program;  no schedule  will\nprovide for fewer than 40 hours of structured training or activities each week,\nunless medically contraindicated;\n4.  Procedures utilized for data collection will  be sufficient to permit a\nqualified professional to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program or\nany part thereof and to monitor the implementation of the plan and ensure its\nmodification, as necessary.  Documentation forms for tracking adaptive and\nmaladaptive behaviors have been standardized. A computerized data tracking\nsystem is being used to provide on-going functional assessment of behavior\nplans.  Graphical  representations  of the data are and will  continue  to be\npresented to the Behavior Management Committee (BMC) and Local Human\nRights Committee (LHRC) and are used for clinical presentations; and\n5.  Identification  of  the  persons  responsible  for  the  consistent\nimplementation of the program.\nC.  NVTCwill consistently implement the training programs required in Paragraph\nB. above for all clients by July 1, 1996, and thereafter within fifteen (15) days of the\ndevelopment of the behavior plan by the ID team and full approval by the Behavior\nManagement  Committee  (BMC),  Local  Human  Rights  Committee  (LHRC)  and\nparent/guardian.  Notwithstanding this time frame, priority in the development and\nimplementation  of training  programs will  be given to any client  exhibiting  self-\ninjurious, aggressive or pica behaviors.  Any such client will have a professionally\ndeveloped and consistently implemented training program within sixty (60) days of\nidentification of the problem.\nD.  In  order  to  afford  consistent  implementation  of training  programs,  NVTC\nprovides and will  continue to provide adequate competency-based training for all\nstaff responsible for implementing the programs specified in Paragraph B above. Staff\ntraining will focus on how to implement the programs and collect appropriate data.\nNVTC will  conduct  regular periodic follow-up evaluations of staff competency  in\nimplementing programs and provide additional training, as necessary.\n1.  By June 1, 1995, center-wide Psychology Behavioral Treatment Books\nwill  be available to all psychology staff, advocate, duty officers and roving\nteam  leaders.  Also by June 30,  1995, Unit-specific  Behavioral  Treatment\nBooks will be accessible to all unit staff as a reference for behavioral support\nplans.\n2.  Greater emphasis upon the preventive and positive procedures of the\n\"Mandt\" Training System have been included in staff orientation and during\nstaff  training  of  individualized  behavior  support  plans.  The  entire  staff\n\norientation  training  package  for  behavior  management  was  reviewed  in\nJanuary 1995 and plans and timelines for a revised training package based\nupon preventive and positive behavioral support program philosophies and\nprocedures have been established.  Implementation  of the revised training\npackage is set for August 1, 1995.\nE.  NVTC has implemented and will fully maintain systems by  March 1, 1996\nfor:  (1) observing clients' behavior to determine the effectiveness of the programs\nand recording those observations;  (2) verifying the reliability of the recorded data;\nand (3) ensuring that a qualified professional reviews and appropriately modifies any\nclient's  training program when the  professional  determines  that the  resident has\nexhibited no measurable progress for a significant period of time.\n1.  Unit-based clinical meetings will continue to occur semi-monthly to\nmonitor  clinical  issues and address changing client needs.  In the Special\nBehavior Unit (SBU), these meetings will occur weekly.\n2.  Unit-based  psychotropic  medication/behavior  plan  reviews  will\ncontinue to occur weekly on the SBU and on all other units at least monthly.\nThis  interdisciplinary  data-based  review  is  attended  by  the  psychiatrist,\nphysician,  psychologist,  psychological  assistant,  nurse,  direct  care  staff,\nprogram  manager  or  team  leader,  and  Qualified  Mental  Retardation\nProfessional  (QMRP).  Vocational  staff,  parents  and  other  pertinent\nprofessional disciplines may also attend.\n3.  Psychology staff will  perform weekly  reliability  checks of treatment\nplans  using direct  observation  of  client  behavior  and  implementation  of\nbehavior  support  plans  by direct  care  staff.  Documentation  of  behavior\nsupport  plans  will  also  be  checked  for  reliability  on  a weekly  basis  by\ncomparing direct care staff and client observations with log entries, behavior\ntracking forms, and entries in the client record by March 1, 1996.\n4.  QMRP's will continue to provide program monitoring at least quarterly\nas part of the Individualized Habitation Plan (IHP) review system.\n5.  Active treatment will continue to be formally monitored using a system\ndesigned  by  Dr.  Brian  Iwata.  Designated  and  trained  staff  will  record\nobservations at least twice a week for every unit.  (Attachment 2).  In January\n1995, a data system was established in which active treatment  information\nfrom  this  form  will  be  used  to  make  management  decisions.  The  Risk\nManager will enter the raw data and monthly reports will be generated for\nreview by management staff.  Active treatment and other measures will  be\nintegrated  into a program monitoring plan to be submitted to the  Quality\nManagement Committee by August 1, 1995.  The results of these measures\n\nwill be compiled and distributed quarterly to all clinical and unit departments\nand to the Quality Management Committee.\nF.  NVTC will develop by January 1, 1996, a system to regularly train all direct\ncare staff in collecting and maintaining the behavioral data necessary to assess the\neffectiveness of any behavior program.  Staff will be fully trained by July 1, 1996.\nNVTC will keep written records to document such training.\nG.  An interdisciplinary team will evaluate the efficacy of the training programs\nfor each client with self-injurious, aggressive or pica behavior on a monthly basis and\nthe efficacy of the training programs for all other clients on at least a quarterly basis.\nThe team will  base its review of the efficacy of the training programs on the data\ncollected as well as the occurrence of incidents (events) and the use of restraints.  If\n1 the team recommends the need to revise the training program, it will be reviewed\nand revised, if appropriate, by a psychologist within thirty (30) days.\nH.  The  Behavior  Management  Committee,  including the  Director  of  Medical\nServices and, as appropriate, a psychiatrist, will review behavior plans and supporting\ndocumentation relating to each resident who:  (1) exhibits self-injurious or aggressive\nbehavior,  or  (2)  is subject  to  restrictive  programming, frequent  behavior  control\nprocedures, or receives behavior modifying medication, to ascertain whether:  (i)\nthere are sufficient behavioral data recorded, (ii) such data have been assessed for\nreliability, and (iii) the continuation of the current training or treatment program is\njustified,  or  the  program,  including  medication,  should  be  modified.  Where\ninadequate  or  unreliable  data are found, or  the continuation  of  the  training  or\ntreatment  program  is otherwise  not  justified, the  matter  will  be  referred  to  the\nappropriate interdisciplinary team which shall, within 30 days of the referral, modify\nthe existing program in accordance with the judgment of qualified  professionals,\nincluding the primary care physician, psychologist and psychiatrist, as appropriate.\nWhen in the judgment of qualified NVTC professionals, data indicates that individual\nprograms  as  implemented  have  been  ineffective  and  outside  independent\nconsultation is necessary to assist in devising an appropriate revision to the program,\nNVTC will obtain such consultation.\nII.  USE OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINT AND TIME OUT\nNVTC has developed and will continue to implement policies and procedures to\nensure that time-out and physical restraints are administered only pursuant to the judgment\nof a qualified professional and are not used as punishment, in lieu of training programs, or\nfor  the  convenience  of  staff.  These  policies  and  procedures  are  contained  in  NVTC\nInstruction  5300  (Restrictive  Procedures) and NVTC Instruction  5301  (Use of  Protective\nDevices) and the Psychology Department's Behavior Therapy Procedures:  Philosophy of\n\nUse, Definition and Staff Responsibilities.  (Attachments 3, 4, and 5).  These policies and\nprocedures will:\nA.  Protect clients from unreasonable risks to their personal safety from both the\nconduct of staff and other clients, and from unreasonable use of bodily restraints.\nB.  Provide for the use of bodily restraint and time-out only in conjunction with\na written treatment and/or training program, except in emergency circumstances. An\n\"emergency\"  is defined as \"a situation  in which a qualified  professional deems a\nbehavior to be likely to cause harm to the client or others or to property unless the\nproposed intervention is immediately initiated.\"  For each emergency use of bodily\nrestraint or time-out, the decision to use the bodily restraint or time-out  must be\nmade by a qualified  professional  after considering a hierarchy  of  less  restrictive\ninterventions.  Each emergency use of bodily restraint or time-out will be described\nand recorded in the client's record including the identity of the professional making\nthe decision and the justification for the decision.  A client who has been placed in\ntime-out or bodily restraints in emergency circumstances three times in the previous\nyear will be assessed and a written treatment and/or training program developed, if\nnecessary, within two weeks of the third incident, except in medical contingencies\nwhere the restraint is prescribed by a physician for short term use while the condition\nis being treated.  A standardized Crisis Management Documentation Form has been\nused since January 1994 to track emergencies and will continue to be used.\nC.  Require that, in every behavior program that utilizes bodily restraint or time-\nout, specification of:\n1.  the behavior to be eliminated and the specific behavior, clearly and\nobjectively defined, which triggers the use of the restraint or time-out;\n2.  behaviors to be taught to the client to replace the behavior that initiates\nthe use of the restraint or time-out and other programs to reduce or eliminate\nthe use of such restraint or time-out;\n3.  the restriction, i.e. type of restraint or time-out authorized and, where\napplicable, the duration of the restriction;\n4.  the professional responsible for the program and the direct care staff\nauthorized to implement the program;\n5.  the frequency and manner in which behavioral data are to be recorded\nby direct care staff.\nIn order to accomplish the above, NVTC has revised the format of all behavior\nsupport  plans  (BSPs).  A  major  emphasis  is placed on functional  analysis-based\n\ntreatment plans which rely upon individualized preventive and proactive behavioral\nprocedures to address challenging behaviors.  (See Attachment 6 for a sample of this\nnew format.)  A short summary of each BSP is also written to be used as a quick,\neasy reference for staff.  All behavior plans and short summaries will be rewritten\ninto this new format corresponding with the client's annual staffing. All BSPs will be\nwritten into the new format by January 31, 1996.\nD.  Require that beginningjanuary 1, 1996, any treatment and/or training program\nutilizing bodily restraint or time-out will be reviewed before implementation and at\nleast every three  (3)  months thereafter  by the  Behavior  Management  Committee\n(BMC) as well as by the Local Human Rights Committee prior to implementation of\nthe program; provided, however, that under emergency conditions, the Chairman of\nthe BMC may approve a program not to exceed 30 days.\nE.  Prohibit the use of bodily restraint or time-out except in:  (a) those situations\nwhere there  is written  evidence  in the client's  record that  other,  less restrictive\ntechniques  have  been  considered  and/or  systematically  tried  and  consistently\nimplemented  as part of a professionally designed training program and accurate,\nobjective  data  have  demonstrated  such  techniques  to  be  ineffective  and  (b)\nemergency situations in which there is a risk of harm to self or others.  Each time a\ndevice is used in an emergency situation or as a protective device, the client record\nmust document  that the decision to so use the device was made by a qualified\nprofessional;  it  must  identify  the  professional  making the decision,  and  it  must\ndocument  the justification  for  such  use.  Any  use of  restraint  will  be the  least\nrestrictive  form  of  restraint  after  consideration  of  a hierarchy  of  less  restrictive\ninterventions.  The  use of papoose boards as a form of behavioral  restraint was\neliminated as of January 18, 1992 and will not be re-implemented.  There are and\nwill be no standing medical orders for PRN psychotropic medications.\nF.  Require that appropriate psychology staff will  review  monthly each use of\nbodily restraints or time-out occurring in the previous 30 days to ascertain whether\neach use was pursuant to the exercise of professional  judgment  or the  behavior\nprogram of the resident subject to the use.  The results of these monthly reviews,\nincluding the conclusions of the psychology staff, will be reported to the BMC every\nthree (3) months, which will  review whether a particular client needs a behavior\nprogram or whether an existing program should be modified. The BMC may initiate\nmore frequent reviews when indicated.  Restrictive measures will  be continued in\nclients' programs only if reliable data supports the necessity of their continued use.\nThe BMC will record these recommendations and transmit them to appropriate staff,\nas well as NVTC management, who will be responsible for ensuring that any new\nprograms or revised programs are developed and implemented within 30 days.\niiir\n\nIII.  STAFFING  REQUIREMENTS\nNVTC will  hire, deploy, and provide ongoing training to a sufficient  number  of\ncompetent  and  qualified  direct  care  and  professional  staff  to  provide  its  clients  with\nadequate care, treatment, and training programs.\nA.  A sufficient  number  of qualified  staff,  including  physicians,  psychologists,\nregistered nurses, licensed practical nurses, registered physical therapists, licensed\nphysical therapy assistants, occupational therapists, speech therapists, dietitians and\ndirect care workers will be available.  NVTC will demonstrate continuing efforts to\nachieve any additions to staff that are necessary for this purpose by January 1, 1996\nand will achieve such staffing by July 1, 1996.\n\" B.  NVTC will maintain adequate direct care staffing levels while  implementing\nits census reduction plan referenced in Section XI.A. below.  NVTC currently meets\nan on duty direct care ratio of 1:4 on the a.m. shift, 1:5 on the p.m. shift and 1:9 at\nnight.  When the client census reaches 200 on July 1, 1996, NVTC will  have and\nmaintain a campus-wide staffing ratio of 1:4,  1:4,  1:8 and will continue to deploy\nstaff based on the exercise of professional judgment to provide for the training and\nsafety needs of all clients.  NVTC will continue to provide 1:1 staffing for individuals\nwhom  qualified  professionals at the facility  have determined  are in  need of  1:1\nstaffing.\nC.  Direct care staff will not be routinely used to perform such support functions\nas housekeeping, laundry, other than client personal clothing, maintenance and meal\npreparation, etc.  This  requirement  does not  preclude  direct  care workers  from\ntraining residents in these functions pursuant to a written training program developed\nin accordance with established procedures.\nD.  NVTC will employ sufficient senior clinical staff to afford adequate clinical\nsupervision,  case consultation, education  and training  of  staff  and to  afford  the\nprovision of adequate services to clients.\nE.  NVTC will continue to employ as Director of Center Programs a behaviorally\ntrained  professional  to  supervise  those who  design  and  implement  appropriate\ntreatment,  training  and  programming  for  clients  and  sufficient  psychologists  to\ndevelop and implement all training programs and data collection and evaluation.\n1.  NVTC currently employs 5 psychologists and 6 qualified psychology\ntechnicians.  NVTC will establish and advertise for one additional psychology\nposition and fill that position by July 1, 1996.\n2.  By July 1, 1996, the overall ratio of psychology staff to clients will be\n1:34.  The psychologist assigned to the Special Behavior Unit will have a ratio\n8\n-im  i  -w\n\nof 1:20 clients plus a small number of clients from Unit 1 with relatively few\nbehavioral needs.\nF.  NVTC will employ sufficient nursing staff to provide adequate nursing services\nto appropriately monitor the clients' health and medical needs.  NVTC currently has\n23 Registered Nurse positions and 4 Licensed Practical Nurse positions representing\na staffing of 14 nurses on A.M. shift, 8.5 on P.M. shift, and 4.5 on NOC shift.  The\non duty nurse to client ratio will continue to be at least 1:25 A.M. shift, 1:30  P.M.\nshift and 1:55  NOC shift.1\nG.  NVTC  currently  employs three  physicians who  serve as the  primary  care\nphysicians for the clients.  NVTC will maintain this level of staffing.  A physician is\non-site or on-call and available seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  NVTC's current\nnight call schedule is published monthly and includes home and beeper numbers.\nTwo of NVTC's physicians cover one night per week and one weekend per month\neach including Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The Medical Director covers one\nnight per week.  A family practitioner covers one night per week.  Another family\npractitioner covers two weekends per month. EMT and ER services are also available\nand located within five minutes from the Center.  NVTC will maintain a night and\non-call system, or a similar system, to meet the requirements of this plan.\nH.  NVTC will afford sufficient consultation with appropriate medical specialists\nincluding  psychiatrists, neurologists, orthopedists and a physiatrist  and  otherwise\nprovide services to clients as may be needed to provide adequate care and treatment.\n(See Attachment 7.)\n1.  NVTC will continue to contract for the on-site services of a psychiatrist\n2 full days per week (at least 6 1/2 hours per day) plus a psychiatric fellow\napproximately one day per week.\n2.  In addition to off-site services, NVTC will continue to contract for the\non-site services of a physiatrist at least quarterly, an orthopedist quarterly, and\na neurologist 2 full days per month. (Full days may be reduced to partial days\nif  and  when  patient  needs  allow.)  NVTC  will  also  continue  periodic\nconsultation with a geneticist for diagnostic purposes.\nI.  By July 1, 1995, NVTC will hire three (3) full time additional physical therapy\npositions with the goal of filling these positions by July 1, 1996.  These positions\ninclude one licensed physical therapist and two physical therapist assistants, bringing\nthe total physical therapy positions at NVTC to 3 registered physical therapists and\nNothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent NVTC in the exercise of its own\ndiscretion, from deploying a greater proportion of nursing staff than is required by this Plan.\n\n3 licensed physical therapy assistants.  This will bring the ratio of physical therapists\nas of July 1, 1996 to  1:34.\nJ.  By  July  1,  1995,  NVTC  will  establish  and  advertise  for  one  additional\nregistered  occupational  therapist  position  and  3 certified  occupational  therapist\nassistant positions.  NVTC's goal is to fill these positions by July 1, 1996.  This will\nbring the total  number  of funded  OT positions to  7.  The ratio of  occupational\ntherapists to clients as of July 1, 1996 will be 1:29.\nK.  By July 1, 1995, NVTC will establish 1.5 additional dietitian positions bringing\nthe total number of dietitian positions to 2.5.  NVTC's goal is to fill these positions\nby July 1, 1996.\nIV.  STAFF TRAINING\nAll  staff  who  provide  services  to  NVTC  clients  are  adequately  trained  to  fully\nimplement the requirements of this Plan and are thereafter provided with in-service training\non a regular basis.  The training will  be competency-based and will  include, but not be\nlimited to:  behavior management techniques; implementation of individualized treatment\nand training  programs; emergency  medical  response, including  recordkeeping  for  such\nprocedures.\nA.  Pre-Service Training\n1.  All new employees of NVTC will continue to be required to attend a\nbasic  orientation  program  within  the  first  30  days  of  employment  and\nsuccessfully complete all components before the end of their  probationary\nperiod. This orientation provides basic information in the following mandated\nsubject areas: Personnel Policies, Orientation to NVTC, Abuse Policy, Human\nRights Regulations, Safety and Security Procedures, Infection Control/AIDS,\nNormalization, Introduction to Mental Retardation, Seizures, First Aid, Body\nMechanics and Lifting, and Sexual Harassment.\n2.  NVTC will continue to require NVTC direct care staff to successfully\ncomplete  additional  training  as  part  of  their  orientation  training,  and  a\ncompetency-based  training  program  at  their  worksite.  (Attachment  8).\nCoursework will  concentrate on additional  health/nursing information  and\nemergency  procedures,  behavior  management  techniques,  appropriate\ninteractions  and  teaching  techniques,  specific  clinical  information  and\nstrategies  necessary  to  be  able  to  implement  individual  programs,  and\ndocumentation and data collection. The orientation program will also include\nActive Treatment, Behavioral Documentation, Use of Mechanical Restraints,\nAdult CPR, Side Effects of Medications, and the Mandt System for Managing\n10\nin i\n\nPeople.  (Attachment 9).  Most of the orientation sessions in the clinical areas\nwill continue to be competency-based (tests, return demonstrations, etc.).  In\naddition, there is a final written exam.  Staff who are unable to demonstrate\ncompetency are terminated from employment.  In keeping with NVTC's goal\nto share resources with the community, the orientation program will continue\nto be offered to all of the local community agencies who frequently attend\nsessions and comment  on the quality  of the training their  staff  receive at\nNVTC.\n3.  Training in the Mandt System will continue to be a component of the\nstaff development program and will focus on all interactions between people.\nThe  major  emphasis of  the  program  is on  non-physical  interventions.  It\nstresses the need to interact appropriately at all times in an effort to prevent\nindividuals from becoming upset.  All direct care staff receive the two-day\nIntermediate  Level  of  training  in  pre-service.  An  annual  one-day\nrecertification is also required.\n4.  All  staff development  programs will  continue to emphasize  several\nmajor  themes  which  support  the  Mission  Statement  of  the  agency:\nappropriate staff to client interactions (treatment with dignity and respect), and\nthe need to encourage and teach client independence.  The importance of\nproviding  an  environment  which  is  supportive,  protective,  encouraging,\nreinforcing,  and  proactive  is  included  throughout  the  entire  orientation\nprogram.\n5.  NVTC has developed and will continue to use a competency-based\ntraining program for new employees which is utilized at the work site once\nthe employee has successfully completed the orientation portion of the pre-\nservice program.  The Direct Care Competency Training Program (DCCTP)\nprovides  opportunities  for  new  staff  to  demonstrate  to  their  supervisors\ncompetence in all aspects of their job responsibilities.  (Attachment 10).  The\nDCCTP  includes  sections  on  Philosophy,  Personal  Care/Health/Hygiene,\nActive Treatment, Documentation, and Policy.  Sections on  Understanding\nBasic Behavior Intervention Programs and Program Implementation have been\nadded  to  the  Active  Treatment  portion  of  the  original  program.  New\nemployees continue to have six months (the remainder of their probationary\nperiod) to complete the program. Accompanying the DCCTP is a competency\nbook  of  50  task  analyzed  job  duties  in  providing  health  related  care,\nstaff/client  interactions,  provide/maintain  a safe  living  area,  and  how  to\nimplement program plans.\n6.  Compliance  with  the  completion  requirements  for  the  Pre-service\nprogram  and  DCCTP  will  continue  to  be  monitored  by  the  Training\nDepartment.  Notices are sent to supervisors monthly advising them of staff\n11\nTWT\n\nneeding to attend specific classes.  A quarterly compliance report is also sent\nto supervisors.  (See Attachment 11 for sample of report.)\n7.  Beginning  April  30,  1995,  NVTC  will  include  in  the  pre-service\ncurriculum two software packages from Softpath Habitation which teach (1)\nActive  Treatment,  and  (2)  Behavioral  Principles  and their  Applications  to\nPeople with Developmental Disabilities. The Active Treatment program is an\nautomated interactive tutorial that teaches the basics of interacting with people\nwith  disabilities  to  ensure their  greater  independence.  The  focus  of  the\nBehavioral program is to teach direct care residential and workshop staff basic\nbehavioral  principles and their  applications to people with  developmental\ndisabilities.  The  principles  are  taught  in  the  context  of  common  life\nexperiences.  Applications are taught in the context of working with people\nwho have developmental disabilities.  Each program is student-paced and is\ncompetency-based. These are intended to supplement classroom sessions, not\nto replace them.\n8.  The Behavior Modification curriculum will be implemented by August\n1, 1995.  The new curriculum will not rely on lecture format solely, but will\nincorporate  experiential  learning  opportunities.  Content  will  include\ntraditional behavior modification and behavior management information, but\nconcentrate on preventive and positive behavior support strategies, functional\nassessment, and person-centered planning.\n9.  NVTC  has  obtained  the  \"Challenges  in  Physical  Management\"\ncurriculum developed by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. This\nis a 2-day comprehensive training program.  The program is divided into 4\nsections:  Body  Mechanics,  Physical Assistance Techniques  and Transfers,\nPositioning, and Putting It All Together.  NVTC is also reviewing a program\nfrom  Texas  which  provides  additional  areas  of  training.  A  qualified\nprofessional will deliver the training.  When adequate professional staff are\navailable, this curriculum will be included in the pre-service program for all\ndirect care staff.  NVTC will  use its best efforts to implement  this training\nprogram by January 31, 1996.\nB.  Other Mandated Training\n1.  NVTC will continue to require the staff to receive refresher training in\nprescribed subject areas on an annual basis.  All staff are required to attend\nclasses on: Abuse Policy, Infection Control/AIDS, Human Rights Policy, Body\nMechanics and Lifting, Sexual Harassment, and the Heimlich Maneuver. In\naddition, direct care staff are required to receive annual training on:  Active\nTreatment,  Crisis  Management,  Adult  CPR,  and  the  Mandt  System.\n(Attachment 12).\n12\nIM'l\n\n2.  In addition to Adult CPR, NVTC will continue to conduct emergency\nmedical response drills.  (Attachment  13).  The purpose of these drills is to\nallow  all  staff  involved  the  opportunity  to  practice  responding  to  mock\nmedical emergencies to better prepare them for a real situation.  Nursing staff\ncoordinate, monitor, and evaluate these drills and send documentation to the\nTraining Department.\n3.  Compliance with mandated training requirements will be monitored by\nthe Training  Department.  Quarterly  summaries of  compliance  rates  with\nmandated training requirements are sent to the supervisors.\n4.  NVTC's curriculum on Client Record System and Documentation has\nbeen developed and will continue to be included in the Annual  Retraining\nProgram.  Target date for implementation was June 30, 1995.\n5.  Recognizing that the skills and knowledge necessary for direct care staff\nassigned to different work sites will vary depending upon the specific needs\nof the clients,  program  managers are in the  process of working with  the\nTraining Department to determine additional training requirements for direct\ncare staff assigned to each unit.  Building 7 began this pilot in late 1994 and\nbegan  implementing  its  plan  in  January  1995.  (See Attachment  14  for\nBuilding  7 Plan).  All  residential  buildings will  have completed  plans by\nSeptember 30, 1995.\nC.  Physical Management Training\nTraining the Physical Management curriculum \"Challenges in Physical\nManagement\", as described in Pre-service Training, Paragraph A.9 above, will\nbegin for direct care and clinical staff by January 31, 1996.  Staff assigned to\nUnits 1, 3A, 3C, 3D, and 5A will participate in more intense in-services and\nclient specific training at their work sites.  These in-services will be provided\nquarterly at a minimum. Whenever an individual client program is developed\nor modified, all staff will be trained on these changes.\nD.  Individual Behavioral Programming Training\n1.  During  pre-service, staff  receive training on  Behavior  Modification,\nTeaching  Techniques  (Task  Analysis,  Prompting,  Reinforcement,  Error\nCorrection),  Crisis  Management,  Behavioral  Documentation,  and  Use  of\nMechanical  Restraints. This training  is meant to be general  in  nature and\nprovide staff with the \"tools\" to be able to implement individualized program\nplans.  However, staff are not permitted to implement program plans until\nthey have received additional training on the individual plans.\n13\n\n2.  Once  an  employee  completes  the  pre-service  program,  he  or  she\nbegins working on the assigned work site.  If clients on the unit have behavior\nprograms, the new staff member is not allowed to implement them until he\nor she has been properly trained by the psychologist or psychology assistant.\nThe psychology staff will monitor the training of each new staff member in all\naspects of the program (including the specific target behavior, the objective,\nhow to prevent the behavior from occurring, what to do when the targeted\nbehavior  is displayed, the adaptive and reinforcement  components  of the\nprogram, and data collection requirements).  NVTC policy also requires that\nstaff be re-trained on all behavior programs whenever there are changes to the\nprogram  or  every  six  months,  whichever  comes  first.  This  training  is\ndocumented and forwarded to the Training Department for inclusion in each\nemployee's training record.\n3.  As new behavior support plans are written and summarized on new\nforms (Client Behavior Profiles), as described in Section II.C above, these will\nbecome a quick study guide and training tool for staff.  Completion date is\nJanuary 31, 1996.\n4.  To  further  develop  the  knowledge  of  staff  regarding  behavioral\nprinciples,  all  direct  care  staff  will  be  required  to  complete  the  \"Basic\nBehavioral Principles and their Applications to People with  Developmental\nDisabilities\" software package previously mentioned  in the section on Pre-\nservice Training.  The completion date for this training for Units 5C, 6, 7C,\n8A, and 8C is October 31, 1995, and for Units 1, 3A, 3C, 3D, 5A, and 7A is\nJune 30, 1996.\nE.  Feeding/Mealtime Training\n1.  The  Training  Department  has begun  providing  and  will  continue  to\nprovide in-services on Active Treatment focusing on the mealtime  activity.\nThis training stresses the importance of implementing individual  goals and\nobjectives from the IHP into the meal experience.  Staff are quizzed on their\nknowledge  of  individual  client  programs,  followed  by  discussion  and\ndemonstration of how these client needs can be integrated and implemented\nbefore, during, and after each mealtime.  NVTC has completed training on\nUnits  1, 3D, 5A,  5C, 6, and  7A.  Units  3C and  7C are scheduled  to be\ncompleted by February 1, 1996.  3A will be completed by March 1, 1996, 8A\nby April 1, 1996 and 8C by May 1, 1996. All active treatment training will be\ncomplete by May 1, 1996.\n2.  A concentrated interdisciplinary effort around several mealtime issues\nwas begun in the Fall of 1994.  The goal is to create a mealtime environment\nand experience which is more normalizing and more enriching, as well as\n14\n\ntherapeutic  in  nature.  This  is  accomplished  by  evaluating  the  physical\nenvironment  of  the  dining  areas,  the  time  and  resources  allocated  to\nmealtimes, and the knowledge of staff in mealtime programs and issues of\nactive treatment.  Clinical staff have established days and times to be in the\ndining  areas to  assist, model, and  provide  feedback  to  staff  on  mealtime\ntechniques and program implementation.  This will continue on an on-going\nbasis.  Monitoring  is to  be done  by  building  supervisory  staff.  Specific\noutcome  measures  will  be  established  by  the  clinical  departments,  in\nconjunction with the I.D. Team, for each specific unit by October 31, 1995.\n3.  As client programs are developed and modified, direct care staff will\ncontinue to be trained in these individual program plans by the appropriate\nclinical  staff.  Such  reviews  are  documented  and  become  part  of  the\nemployee's training record.  Clinical staff regularly and periodically  review\ngeneral information as well as client-specific information with the staff.  This\nis documented and forwarded to the Training Department for inclusion in the\nemployee's training record.\n4.  NVTC has purchased a tutorial software package on Active Treatment\nwhich will be included in the pre-service program.  All direct care staff will\ncomplete the tutorial by July 1, 1996.\nF.  Continuing Education for Professional Staff\n1.  NVTC has established minimum continuing education requirements for\nits clinical staff.  (Attachment  15).  These were established for  professional\npositions  for  which  there  are no  state  mandated  or  licensing  continuing\neducation  requirements.  These  were  established  by  the  appropriate\ndepartment  heads and were based on standards from other states.  Clinical\nstaff  who  attend  a  training  event  which  meets  a  continuing  education\nrequirement send documentation of this to the Training Department and it is\nentered into their training record.  Summaries of training are provided to the\nsupervisors and employees upon request.  This continuing education process\nwill be ongoing.\n2.  Records  will  be  kept  on  compliance  with  required  continuing\neducation  and reported  back to supervisors and the Quality  Management\nCommittee on a quarterly basis.  Reports will begin with training completed\nby December 31, 1995.\n15\n\nV.  PHYSICAL THERAPY AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY MANAGEMENT\nNVTCwill provideclientswith adequate physical management, including appropriate\nphysical therapy and occupational  therapy programs.  In addition to staffing outlined  in\nSection III, J and K, NVTC shall take the following steps to accomplish this:\nA.  Physical Therapy\n1.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will design and provide new wheelchairs\nand seating systems to 32 residents.  (Attachments 16 and 18).\n2.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will design and fit 19 new seating systems\ninto current wheelchairs.\n3.  By  December  31,  1996,  NVTC  will  upgrade  and/or  replace  the\nremaining  third  of  individual  wheelchairs.  Provision  of wheelchairs  and\nwheelchair  modifications will  be based upon a professional  assessment of\nthose most in need; all adaptive equipment will be individualized and there\nwill  be  a  continual  adaptation  of  wheelchairs  and  other  equipment  as\nindividual needs change.  (Attachments 16 and 18).\n4.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will develop and staff an on-site workshop\ndedicated to wheelchair and positioning equipment.\n5.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will complete modifications to the water\nheating system for the Hubbard Tank to permit staff to conduct hydrotherapy\nduring cold weather months.\n6.  By  June  30,  1996,  NVTC  will  reevaluate  all  clients  with  fixed\ncontractures and reassess their potential for improvement with  consultation\nfrom orthopedic and physiatric consultants.\n7.  By June 30, 1995, NVTC will establish 24-hour positioning schedules\nfor all clients in need of positioning on Unit 1 and Building 3:\na.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will  begin taking photographs of\nclients in various positions, with accompanying written descriptions of\nthe benefits of placement in each position. These photographs will be\nassembled in unit-based books for daily use.\nb.  By April 30, 1995, NVTC will implement completed positioning\nprograms in Unit 1.\n16\n!••'!\n\nc.  By June 30, 1995, NVTC will implement completed positioning\nprograms in Building 3.\n8.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will establish and implement a staff training\ncourse  for  physical  management  of  clients  who  demonstrate  challenging\nmealtime and positioning needs.\n9.  By July  1, 1995, NVTC will  select a physical  management  training\nprogram following review of several physical management training packages\nby the Training Department, Director of Occupational Therapy, Director of\nPhysical Therapy and Director of Center Programs.\n10.  By July 1,1996, physical management training will become part of pre-\nservice orientation for all new staff and yearly re-training will also be required.\nB.  Occupational Therapy\n1.  A new Director of Occupational Therapy Services was hired on July\n18,  1994.  The Director will  not serve as program manager for any other\nBuilding or Unit at NVTC.\n2.  By December 31, 1995, NVTC will be established as an internship site\nfor students in occupational therapy professional training programs.\n3.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will complete a pilot project involving sensory-\nmotor integration training/treatment for four clients.  Data will be collected\nand assessed. If data shows positive benefits for clients, the training/treatment\nprogram  will  be  implemented  with  other  clients  whose  need  for  such\ntraining/treatment has been identified by professional staff.\nVI.  NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT AND FEEDING\nNVTC will provide clients with adequate nourishment, identification of nutritional\ndeficiencies and appropriate feeding programs and adaptive equipment for use at mealtimes.\nNVTC will take the following steps to accomplish this:\nA.  By April  1, 1995, NVTC developed and began pilot  implementation  of a\nNutritional Risk Assessment Form.\n1.  Pilot  testing,  modification  and  refinement  of  the  Nutritional  Risk\nAssessment Form will be completed by December 31, 1995.\n17\n\n2.  A Nutritional Risk Screening Assessment form has been completed for\neach  resident  determined  by  staff  to  have  specialized  nutritional  and/or\nfeeding needs, and such a form will be completed for each resident identified\nin the future with a specialized need.  Training appropriate to the resident's\nneeds, based upon nutritional risk assessment, will be conducted for all staff\nmembers having nutritional responsibility and/or feeding responsibilities with\nrespect to the resident.  It is understood that staff working with residents with\nthe highest risk will be the first to receive the training.\nB.  By July 1, 1995, NVTC will  establish one and one-half additional  dietitian\npositions.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC shall have on staff two and one-half Registered\nDietitians.\nC.  By September 1, 1995, NVTC will have provided consultation to direct care\nand professional staff on Units 1 and Building 3 by a multi-disciplinary  nutritional\nmanagement team, including an occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech\npathologist and dietitian.  (Attachments 17 and 18).\nD.  By December 31, 1995, NVTC will receive equipment designated as needed\nto implement modifications identified by nutritional assessments.  Items will include\none weighing scale, specialized calipers to assess nutritional status and measuring\nboards.\nE.  By December 31, 1995, NVTC will purchase the adaptive equipment for use\nduring  meals  which  has  been  identified  as  needed  by  physical  therapy  and\noccupational therapy staff.  (Attachments 16 and 18).\nF.  By July 1, 1995, NVTC will receive 30 dining room chairs and accompanying\ntables for mealtime use on Building 3.\nG.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will install a dishwasher in the Building 3 dining\nroom, so all adaptive equipment can be cleaned on-site.\nH.  By March 30, 1995, NVTC will install an answering machine in Dietary the\nServices office to permit units to report, at all hours, adaptive feeding equipment\nneeds.\nI.  By July 1, 1996, NVTC will provide for diagrams and photographs of residents\nto be placed in the dining room next to each resident.\n18\n\nVII.  MEDICAL CARE\nResidents will be provided with adequate medical care. In order to accomplish this,\nNVTC will:\nA.  Quality Assurance\nImplement a peer review  mechanism for all disciplines  involved in\nproviding health services. The Quality Assurance Program for Health Services\n(Attachment  19) provides  for systematic  credentialing  procedures,  staff\neducation,  reviews of adverse events or outcomes by a Clinical  Practice\nReview  Committee, as well  as for peer  review  for medical  and nursing\npractitioners.\na.  Medical peer review was initiated on November 4, 1994 and\nthe process of this review will continue, with systemic refinements, as\nneeded.\nb.  NVTC's  medical  director  will  serve on a committee  which\nincludes the Director of Resident Records in order to develop a system\nfor monitoring and improving physician documentation in charts. This\nreview and planning period will be completed by September 1, 1995.\nB.  Medical Specialty Consultation\nNVTC  maintains a regular  schedule of consultation  with  medical\nspecialists.  (See Attachment 7.) These include neurology, ENT, orthopedics,\nophthalmology,  psychiatry,  physiatry,  gastro-intestinal,  podiatry,  urology,\ncardiology, gynecology, dermatology and genetics. Recruitment for additional\nspecialty medical consultants will continue, as needs are identified.  Notes\nfrom these consultations will continue to be included in residents' records and\na procedure for monitoring will be established by September 30, 1995. See\nalso Section IX. Recordkeeping Section.\nC.  Medical Management of Residents with Epilepsy\n1.  An interdisciplinary epilepsy committee developed and implemented\na  new charting  system  for the epilepsy  clinic.  (See Attachment 20.)\nInformation  from this charting will be incorporated  into the new  resident\nrecord system by March 30, 1995.  A procedure for monitoring compliance\nwith the requirement of inclusion of charting information into resident records\nwill be established by September 30, 1995.\n19\n\n2.  By  December  31,  1995,  semi-annual  audits  of  antiepileptic  drug\nprescribing practices will  be conducted by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics\nCommittee,  which  performs  the  functions  of  a  drug  utilization  review\ncommittee.  Information  from  these  audits  will  be  considered  by  the\ninterdisciplinary  epilepsy  committee  and  will  submitted  to  the  Quality\nManagement Director.  Appropriate monitoring and follow-up will occur, as\nnecessary.\na.  NVTC will  emphasize use of monotherapy  and deemphasize\nuse of barbiturates and phenytoin.\nb.  The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will  continue to\nmonitor the consistency of charting and medication adjustment/change\nin individuals with epilepsy and seizures.\nc.  One  index  of  improved  quality  of  life  for  clients  receiving\nepileptic  drugs  has  been  identified  as reduced  use of  helmets  for\nclients with  epilepsy.  Monitoring  of  frequency  of  helmet  use has\nshown a reduction of 38% in the use of helmets from 45 in 1989 to\n28 in February, 1995.  NVTC will  rely upon controlled  medication\ntrials and ongoing monitoring of improvement to determine  further\nappropriate reduction of helmet use.  (Attachment 4).\n3.  Individual  treatment  protocols  for  status  epilepticus  will  be\nimplemented by September 30, 1995.\n4.  A  videotape  and  brochures  for  staff  and family  education  will  be\ncompleted by the interdisciplinary epilepsy committee by October 30, 1995.\n5.  Beginning June 30, 1995, the interdisciplinary epilepsy committee will\nreview  epilepsy-related  injuries,  infirmary  and  hospital  admissions  on  a\nquarterly basis and report its analysis of this data to the Quality Management\nDirector.\n6.  Guidelines were developed  in September,  1994 for nursing care of\nclients with  seizures  and for  first  aid  by  residential  staff.  Guidelines  for\nresidential staff were posted in October, 1994.  (Attachment 21).\nCompliance with these guidelines will be assessed through routine audits of\nindividual charts by a procedure to be established by September 30, 1995.\n20\n!••!\n\nD.  Emergency Responsiveness\n1.  Monthly emergency responsiveness drills, involving nursing, security\nand residential staff, were begun in May, 1994.  (Attachment 22).  The nurse\nmanager will  monitor the monthly drill  reports and forward the analysis of\nthese results  and  recommendations  to  the  Quality  Management  Director,\nbeginning on September 30, 1995.\n2.  Documentation of response times of EMS personnel to 911 calls from\nNVTC and of NVTC nurses to on-campus emergencies was begun in May\n1994.  (Attachment 23).  The nurse manager will monitor the response times\nof  EMS  and  nursing  staff  members  and  will  report  the  results  of  this\nmonitoring to the Quality Management Director, beginning on June 30, 1995.\n3.  Emergency notification procedures were posted on residential units in\nOctober, 1994. (Attachments 24 and 25). Compliance with these procedures\nwill be monitored by the nurse manager through chart audits, and compliance\nrates  gathered  from  this  monitoring  will  be  submitted  to  the  Quality\nManagement Director, beginning on September 30, 1995.\nVIII.  MEDICATION MANAGEMENT\nBeginning December 1, 1995, a semi-annual audit of psychotropic medication\nprescribing  practices  will  be  conducted  by  the  Pharmacy  and  Therapeutics\nCommittee, which performs the function of a drug utilization review committee, with\nthe  results  of  these  audits  transmitted  to  the  Quality  Management  Director.\nAppropriate monitoring and follow-up will occur, as necessary.\n1.  Since mid-1989, NVTC's use of antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs has\nbeen reduced by 33%.  As of December 31, 1994, 26 clients were receiving\nthis class of drugs, in comparison with  39 residents five years  previously.\n(Attachment 26).\n2.  The Dyskinesia Identification System: Condensed User Scale (DISCUS)\nwas adopted for monitoring tardive dyskinesia and other side-effects of clients\non psychotropic medications in August, 1993.  (Attachment 27).  Information\nfrom  this  instrument  will  be  reviewed  quarterly  by  the  Pharmacy  and\nTherapeutics  Committee  beginning  in June,  1995.  Information  from  this\nreview will be submitted to the Quality Management  Director.\n3.  The consulting psychiatrist and Medical Director will continue to serve\nas members of the Behavioral Management Committee.\n21\n\n4.  NVTC will  follow  its policies and procedures  regarding the  use of\npsychotropic  medication,  e.g.  NVTC  Instruction  5302  on  Psychotropic\nMedication (Attachment 28), Medical Plan for Psychotropic Drug Use, consent\nforms (Attachment 29) and Health Services Policy and Procedures (Attachment\n30).\nIX.  RECORDKEEPING\nNVTC will develop and implement a system of records for each client, developed\nand  maintained  under  the  supervision  of  a  qualified  professional  whose  primary\nresponsibility  will  be to  properly  maintain client  records.  Each record will  be  readily\navailable to all staff and will contain current information with respect to the client's care,\nmedical treatment, and training, and will  be organized so as to enable those using it to\nrender  professional judgments  in providing care, medical treatment, and training to the\nclient.  NVTC will  require staff to utilize such records in making care, medical treatment,\nand training decisions.\nNVTC has approved for implementation a new Client Records System, the \"Source\nOriented Medical Record with Integrated Progress Notes\".  Revision of the record system\nhas been divided  into five phases:  I.  Recruitment; II. Research and Development; III.\nTraining; IV. Implementation, and V.  Quality Management. Timetables for each section are\noutlined in Attachment 31.  Phases I and II have been completed.  NVTC's plan provides\nfor:\nA.  Recruitment of a qualified Health Information Manager.  A new Director of\nResident  Records,  was  hired  on  August  22,  1994.  This  position  will  oversee\nimplementation of the new client records system in 1995.\nB.  Development of a new Client Records System:  Following three months of\nreviewing  the  current  records  management  system, site visits  to  other  facilities,\nsolicitation of input from facility staff and researching recordkeeping techniques, a\nnew client  record system was proposed.  In November and December  1994, the\nproposal  was  presented  to  Resident  Record  Committee  members,  clinical  and\nresidential  staff and Senior  Staff.  On  December  20, 1994, the Source  Oriented\nMedical Record with Integrated Progress notes was approved for use beginning June\n30, 1995.  Attachment 32 summarizes the system which has been accepted.\nC.  The most significant change represented by the new client record system is\nthe integrated progress note, \"Interdisciplinary  Note\", section.  In this centralized\nsection, professional disciplines will be charting information pertaining to the client.\n(Attachment 33).  Specific documentation instruction to staff include guidelines for\nall those making entries into the centralized progress notes and contain \"prompts\" for\n22\nTin\n\nentry  of  indicators  such  as  \"OT  Monthly  Notes\"  as a title  (qualifier)  for  easy\nidentification and review.\nD.  Training:  Beginning in March, 1995, Medical Records staff, in conjunction\nwith the Training Department, will begin training in the new records system.  Small\ndepartmental groups have been targeted for individualized training.  Training will\nrequire each staff member to convert an existing client record to the format created\nby the new  records system.  Instructional  guides will  be provided  for  each staff\nmember.  Training for all residential and clinical staff will be completed by June 30,\n1995.  Follow-up sessions will be scheduled, as needed.\nE.  Implementation:  Since  records  will  be  revised  during  training  sessions,\nfacility-wide implementation of the new records system will be completed by June\n30, 1995.\nF.  Quality Management: By June 30,1995, the current Resident Records Quality\nManagement Plan will  be amended to include quality mechanisms for  monitoring\nimplementation of the new system.  Amendments will include provisions for:\n1.  Establishing  a  random  sampling  of  records  from  each  unit  for\ncompliance review by the Medical Record department staff and members of\nthe Resident Record Committee.\n2.  Completion  of  initial  reviews  for  all  units  will  be  completed  by\nSeptember 30, 1995 and a schedule for ongoing reviews of compliance with\nrequirements of the new system.\n3.  Establishing criteria for monitoring which include, at a minimum:\na.  correct chart identification on each CRS;\nb.  correct record filing order;\nc.  correct chronological date order for documents;\nd.  entries made to the integrated progress notes which are prefaced\nwith qualifiers stating the discipline documenting the note; and\ne.  correct use of double-sided progress notes.\n4.  Reporting results of each random sampling on a quarterly basis to the\nQuality Management Committee and the facility Resident Records Committee.\n23\n\nX.  QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN\nNVTC  will  develop  and annually  update  a Quality  Management  Plan  that  will\nmonitor, document and evaluate implementation  of the activities  identified  in this Plan.\nAttachment 34 is NVTC's Quality Management Plan for FY 94-95.\nXI.  COMMUNITY PLACEMENT\nA.  NVTC will reduce the number of current clients at NVTC in accordance with\nthe NVTC Community  Integration  Initiative developed  in  1991 with  the  primary\nobjective of reducing current (i.e. 1991) resident census from 270 to 200 persons.\nThis will be accomplished by securing appropriate community-based placements for\nthose clients it determines in accordance with professional judgment to be eligible\nand appropriate for such placement, subject to the procedures described  in  ^ C\nbelow.  Full implementation of the Community Initiative will occur by July 1, 1996.\nAttached is a description of the Community Initiative outlining timelines employed,\nschedule for continued downsizing, and the process that has been used and will be\nused to meet its objectives.  (Attachment 35).\nB.  NVTC will annually assess the needs of all remaining residents at NVTC as\nfollows:\n1.  The  treatment  team  will  annually  assess  in  accordance  with  the\nexercise of professional judgment the needs of all residents at NVTC at the\ntime of the development  of the annual  IHP to  render an evaluation  with\nrespect  to  the  appropriateness  of  continued  placement  at  NVTC.  Such\nassessments will  occur  more  frequently  if  a change  in  the  needs  of  the\nresident so indicates.\n2.  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  ^  4,  if  all  appropriate  professionals\nemployed by or under contract with the Commonwealth to assess a resident,\nincluding but not necessarily limited to the assigned interdisciplinary team,\ndetermine that NVTC is not an appropriate setting for a resident and that a\nresident  would  be  more  appropriately  served  in  a  community  setting,\nappropriate professionals will, within a reasonable time thereafter, develop\nsuch plan as may be appropriate and feasible to provide necessary services to\nthe resident in a community setting, and will place the resident in accordance\nwith the plan within a reasonable time after such plan has been developed\nand can be feasibly implemented.  Sound, prudent fiscal considerations, and\ngenerally accepted business practices may be used by NVTC in determining\nwhether a plan to place a resident in the community  is feasible and, if so,\nwhen such plan can be feasibly implemented.  In no event will  NVTC have\nan obligation  under  the  Plan to discharge or  transfer  a resident  before a\n24\n\ncommunity setting that would more appropriately serve the resident has been\nidentified and there is such a setting available.\n3.  In all decisions with  respect to  individual  residents, the views  and\nopinions of the individual resident, parent(s), guardian(s), other appropriate\nsurrogate decision-maker(s) and professionals will be appropriately considered\nby NVTC.  When it is determined that NVTC is not an appropriate setting for\na resident, NVTC will ensure that the views and opinions of the individual\nresident, parent(s), guardian(s), appropriate surrogate decision-maker(s) and\nprofessionals  will  be  considered  when  developing  and  implementing  an\nappropriate and feasible discharge plan.\n4.  Where the consent of parent(s), guardian(s), or other surrogate decision-\nmakers) is withheld regarding discharge or placement, in disagreement with\nthe  judgment  of  professionals  employed  by  or  under  contract  with  the\nCommonwealth, NVTC will  make its discharge and transfer decisions after\nconsultation  with  the  individual  resident,  parent(s),  guardian(s)  or  other\nappropriate  surrogate  decision-maker(s)  and, after  such  consultation,  will\nengage in a good faith effort to reach a consensus as to what decision about\ndischarge and/or placement is in the best interests of the individual  NVTC\nresident in exercise of its discretion on a case-by-case basis.  The parent(s),\nguardian(s) or other surrogate decision-maker(s) may present the opinion of a\nqualified professional(s) for consideration by NVTC with respect to discharge\nand/or placement decisions.  If the NVTC decision is ultimately to retain the\nresident, NVTC will continue to involve the parent(s), guardian(s) or other\nsurrogate decision-maker(s) in the treatment and discharge planning process\nand continue to make them aware of available opportunities in the community\nfor  the  care  of  the  resident  through  parental  educational  opportunities\nconducted by community providers.\ne:\\kbc\\cripa\\nvtccln\n25\n\nBEHAVIORAL PROGRAMS:  2/24/95\nADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS TRAINING PROCEDURES\nPB - ProSocial Behavioi AC - Appropriate Communicaiioo DRO • Differential Reinforcement of Other Bebavion RT • Relaxation Trunin(\nOT • OoilU Touchiog AM • Accept Medication DRI -  Difftrtoiiai Raiaforeaaaai of boompatibla Bahaviora SS • Scnaory SimuJaiio*\nCL - Connuniir Uvaif OM • Otject Manipulation DRA • Differential RafaforctDjanl of Appropriate Behavior* IE • Item Exchange (Pica)\nTR • Tderait Re fault TT • Traatitioa Training CT • ConnunicatJoa Tranbai TE • Token Economy\nCM - Choice MaUns CB * Cooperate Behavior I/GC • Individual/Group Couai<lin[ LS • L<*d Syncn\nSS - Sensory Stimulation AM • Abwnce of MaJadaptJva Beta OB - Odor Board fP • PoniitT Pridkc\nNote:  Is addition lo tpecific Uftiaiaf procedures, appropriale provtol»(ive procedure!,\nla da di a | cannMNtalal Caclort, ha*a b««a coaridarad is dia Uaiaia| profraaiL\nMALADAPT1VE BEHAVIORS INTERVENTION PROCEDURES\nWr - Wnppmc TR - Tear or Remove Ootbci NO » NoniernovaHc Carmeni CB * CoraiDUnictuon Board\nHC \" Nan Cooperation LWA - Lcavinf Wjihom Apotoval TO • Tt«r Rcattiam Otmaai Ra •  Rcniaiiioa\nSi • Send Behavior IS • Inappropnile Social Bdiavior BR •  Bedioon Co •  Counidioj\nMo • Mouihmj IP • Inappropriate Phvrical Behavior QA • Quiet Area RC •  ReiponiaCoii\nSi • Stealing Ta • Tantrum (veil, etc.) OR - Ouiet Room SR - Self Rtniiia\nSin  • fcce> Th • Threatiol A[^ TO • Time Out 5« -SelfmQR\nSp » Spinint DB • Diimpiive Behifior Ei • Extinction Ml -  Placed on Mai\nNS - No!

Pt.rpn«ta  To define restrictive procedures at NVTC and to specify philosophy of use\nof restrictive procedures with clients.\nII.  ranrptigrtnn  NVTC Instruction 5300 dated. September  1, 1992 is hereby canceled.\nIII.  nafinmnn  A restrictive procedure is defined as any procedure which:\nA.  Restncts a client's freedom of movement and/or\nB.  Limits access to activities, objects or events to which a client would otherwise\nbe entitled as a part of his/her human rights and/or\nC.  Requires a  client to perform a specific  behavior , such an over correction\nprocedure, and/or\nD.  Results  in altered  states of consciousness  (see  NVTC  Instruction  5302.\nPsychotropic Medication).\nIV.  Phiinsnphy  it is the policy  and philosophy  of NVTC  to emphasize  positive\napproacnes to behavior  management,  the  least  restrictive  interventions for each\nindividual  client  and to ensure the protection  of each  individual's  rights  when\nrestrictive  procedures  are utilized.  The least  restrictive  alternative is then to be\ndefined as those procedures which most quickly eliminate the behaviors for which\nthey  were  designed  intrusive  only  to the point  required  to achieve  clinical\neffectiveness so that the individual is able to participate more fully in ail phases of\nhis/her daily  life.  Interventions with any degree of restrictiveness must be designed\nby the IO Team, approved by the individual and his/her representative, the Behavior\nManagement Committee, the Director and the Local Human Rights Committee, and\nreviewed at least every six months.\nBehavior programs are designed for individual residents taking into consideration not\nonly  the  above  factors  but  also  the  individual  needs,  strengths and\ndevelopmental/social levels of the clients.  Procedural safeguards are also included\nto ensure that the individual's rights to effective treatment and freedom from undue\ncoercion are balanced and protected.\nV.  Prp/*grttirp\nA.  Programmatic  Uses.  Restrictive procedures  are one component of a total\npositive training effort designed by the ID team with the exception of certain\n\nVTC INSTRUCTION  5300\nAGE 2\nemergency situations.  See tne NVTC Behavior Therapy Procedures Manual\nfor  full  description  of  program  elements,  limitation  of  use,  reviews  and\ndocumentation necessary for program implementation.  A  copy of this manual\nis located  with  all NVTC  psychologists, ail Senior  Staff  members.  Program\nManagers, on all residential units, and the Director,  NVTC.\nB.  No  staff  may  initiate  restrictive  procedures  except  under  those  conditions\nspecified under Programmatic Uses, and then only when necessary approvals\nand  documentation  have  been  obtained.  Violations  may  be  abusive  and\nconsidered in accordance with OMHMRSAS and NVTC policy on abuse.\nC.  Community  Programs must contact  NVTC in advance  to  secure the  above\nidentified reviews and approvals prior to implementation, per our contractual\nagreements with them.\nD.  Restraints used as Protective Devices.  Refer to NVTC Instruction 5301.\nE.  Non-Programmatic Uses.  Crisis Management (Emergency Procedures):  In the\nevent an emergency situation exists where it is likely that a client couid harm\nhimself/herself or others and less restrictive procedures are not effective, the\nclient can be physically restrained (MANOT techniques) by any staff member\nfor up to one hour.  During that hour if the staff member  believes that the\nphysical  restraint  is ineffective  the  unit  psychologist  should  be called.  If\nunavailable  the  on-call  psychologist  should  be contacted  with the  Chief  of\nPsychological  Services; Physician and NVTC  Director  as back-up.  A Crisis\nManagement Form must be completed by the staff and forwarded to the NVTC\nRisk Manager.  If the need for an emergency restraint occurs three times in one\nyear, the need for a more restrictive program will be assessed.\nVI.

AND STAJ7 R£S?0NSX3rLiriIS\nPHILOSOPHY\nThe Northern Virginia Training Canter (NVTC, Is dedicated ta\nthe principle that all individuals are entitled ta develop to\ntheir fullest potential and become as independent as their\ninnate capability will permit.  (See Appendix A far Missions\nand Goals of NVTC.)  Individuals of all ages and sax vita\ndevelopmental disabilities, regardless of the nature and\ndegree of their cognitive, emotional, behavioral, or physical\ndisability, are capable of learning and will benefit from tne\nsuccessrul application of current behavioral tacnnoiogies.\nTne Mandt System of behavioral interaction has been adapted by\nthe commonwealth of Virginia and accurately reflects tne\ntraataent pnilasocny of NVTC.  This system not only provides\ntie underlying foundation for all behavioral interactions vita.\ntae clients but is also viewed as an integral component of. all\nformalized behavioral management programs.  All staxf are\ntrained in cae use of tae Mandt System and are expected to\nintegrate tie application of nonpnysical and physical methods\nof interaction vita formalized restrictive and nonrestrictive\nbehavioral programs.  (See Appendix K for an outline, i.e.,\ntable of content,, of tae Mandt System.)\nThe policy and philosophy of NVTC is to (a) focus on equipping\nall clients to ccsaunicate their r.&^ds and desires, providing\naoceis of adaptive and socially acceptable behavior, and\nproviding environments and experiences that are reinforcing,\nand (b) seeic tae least restrictive programming alternative for\neach client, i.e. , there must be a match between the nature\nand severity of tae problem and rastricrtiveness/intrusiveness\nof tae procedure, and (c) ensure the protection of each\nindividual's rights vhen restrictive procedures are utilized.\nThe least restrictive alternative is to be defined as those,\nprocedures vhica will most quicJdy eliminate the behaviors for\nwaica they were iatanded, iatrusive only to tha point required\nto achieve clinical effectiveness, so that taa individual is\nthen able to participate more fully in all phases of his/her\ndaily schedule of training programs.\nBehavior Taerapy Programs are based on the premise that\nadantive and maladaptive behaviors are learned behaviors, and\n\nhence can be modifisd through the systematic application of\nprinciples af learning.  These programs are developed vith the\nparricipacion of individuals served and their parents,\nguardians, or advocates, are designed izr individual clients\ntatting into consideration not only tie aaove tactsrs bur also\n\"ne individual needs, strengths and developmental/social\nlevels  o£  <=ia« eiianc.  ?3?oe««tiral  eara«?Uird*  iriClUdttfl  in  ^Hie\ndocument  are  designed  ts  ensure  ciat  rie  individual's  rights.\nto  effective  habiii-aticn  and  freedom  from  undue  csercion  are\nbalanced  and  protsctsd.\nTlie  purpose  of  tiiis  Behavior  THerapy  Procedures  manual  is  to\nprovide  policy  and procedural  guidelines  for  zh.e design,\ndevelopment,  and  implementation  of  tre&csint  programs  for\nindividuals  with  specific  behavioral  training  needs.  r^  is\nour  expectation  \".ax  services  delivered  tiirsugh.  quality\nbehavioral  programs  vill  enhance  the  maturation,  development,\nv«ll-*D«ing,  and quality  of  life  of  all  JTVTC clients  within  the\nmost  noraal  and  least  rastricrive  environment  csnsistant  with\ntheir  needs.\n\nIX.  DESIGN OF BEHAVIOR THEHAPY PP.OGSAMS  !\n3ehavioral therapy programs at ;T7TC ars based on the modal of\n\"Behavioral Deficits/Behavioral Excesses.\"  Therefore, Che\nindividualized habilitation plan far a client who exhibits\naaladaptive behavior includes provisions to teach the\nindividual tie circumstances, if any, under vhich the behavior\ncan ba exaibitsd adaptiveiy, to taacn the individual how to\nchannel the behavior into similar adaptive expressions, or to\nreplace the maladaptive behavior with behavior that is\nadaptive.  Reliance on raactive control procedures is\nunacceptable.\nIndividuals* behaviors ara reviewed and analyzed to determine\npotential causes of maladaptive behaviors that say be related\nto factors in the individual's li*e, such as (a) lacJc of\nexposure to positive models and teaching strategies, (b) laeJc\nof ability to ccamunicats needs and desires, (c) lacJc of\nsuccess experiences, (d) lade cf social, community, and\nleisure slcills, (e) insufficient quantity of high quality\nactivities at an appropriate level, (f) lacJc cf opportunities\nto interact vith others, (g) history of inappropriate\nreinxarcement and punishing experiences, (hj inadequate coping\nsJcills to deal with frustration, stress, and anger, (i)\nboredom and environmental stresses, (j) a physiological\ncondition, e.g., pain, discomfort, and law sensory threshold\nsuch that 3ialadaptive behavior occurs when the thrashold is\nbreached, or (fc) psychiatric conditions.\nBehavior management programs are designed to raduce or\neliminate behaviors vhich iirtarfars with ongoing training, and\nts taacn the client nore socially acceptable behaviors.\nBehavior programs provides a hicn degrae of consistancy by\nidentifying t«e ta-rcatad behaviors and specifying vnat the\nstaff response should be.  Behavior programs generally consist\naf tvo main components.  The first is a sat cf training\nprocedures taacn clients alternative replacement behaviors\nwhich serve the same function fpurpose) as the maladaptive\nbehaviors.  For example, taaching a client to gat attention by\nJcnocicing on the team station door rather than engaging in\nself-injury.  The second is a reactive procedure to manage the\nmaladaptive behavior when it occurs.  This may consist of\nprocedures ranging from vernal prompts to \"calm down\" to the\napplication cf highly restrictive mechanical restraints.\nSeveral essential procram development components must be\naddressed before a comprehensive and effective behavioral\nprograms can ba designed.  These basic components, as\ndescribed balow, aust be taken into consideration regardless\n\nof the individuals adaptive oehavior training needs, severity\nor nacurs or targeted aaiadaptive behaviors, or degree of\nprogram rastrir:iveness.  See also Section III.\nA.  Socially appropriate benaviors which are currently\navailable and displayed by the ciianc Bust be identified.\nAdditional training say ba needed Co strengthen these\nbehaviors or develop new behaviors as replacements for\ninappropriate and maladaptive behaviors.\n3.  Targeted maladaptive behaviors muse ba claariy defined\nand described in detail (e.g., operational definitions)\nto enable staff ta accurately record their frequency,\nintensity, duration, and other significant behavioral\ncharacteristics.  There are several categories of\ninzcrmation vhich should be collected as a parr of\nbaseline data.  These, in addition to the behaviors\nthemselves, include: (a) antecedents - what happened or\nwhat conditions existed just before the maiadaptive\nbehavior occurred;  (b) consequence - what happened to\nthe antecedent conditions as a result of the maladaptive\nbehavior;  (c) client's response - how did the client\nresponded to the consequence;  and (d) ecological or\nenvironmental conditions - where the behavior occurred,\ntime, date, persona present, noise level, etc.\nBaseline data are then collected over a specified period\nof time without any intervention in order to (a) provide\ninformation in determining the function or purpose of - the\nbehavior, i.e., why the client engages in the behavior,\nand (a) determine the effectiveness of the treatment\nprocedure (behavior program) by comparing baseline data\nto treatment data.\nCollection of baseline data can taJce a variety of\ndifferent fcras depending upon the type and rats of\nbehavior.  Generally, low severity behaviors, SUCH as\ntantrums can be observed over an extended period of tiae\nwith minimal interventions whereas severe self-injurious\nbehaviors cannot be unattended for any length of time.\nAlso, low frequency maladaptive behaviors aay require an\nextend period to time to observe these behaviors in\nsufficient frequency to establish a pre-treatment rate of\noccurrence.  On the other hand, high frequency behaviors\nmay ba sampled or probed during specific time periods,\ne.g. , collecting data for an hour each day for a veeic*\n2.  An assessment of the client's motivational, bases for the\ntargeted maladaptive behavior(s) is conducted by the_\npsychologist through record reviews, direct observations\nof the client, and vith input frenx ether zemoers of the\nclient's Interdisciplinary Team.  This procedure may\n\ninclude, but not limit ad «,  me  fallowing forms of\nassassatnts:  structural, functional, and analog.  (For a\nmare data:.lea description or the assessment procedure and\nan example or t.-s worksheet usad in this process, pleasa\nrefer en Appendix D.)\nD.  Once the behavioral assassaant has be*n completed, thA\npsychologist continues his/her leadership rala in tha\ndesign and development of a comprehensive behavioral\nprogram.  Among the issues zz ba addrassad are:\n1.  Ecology.  The relative significance of tie\nenvironmen-c on raa client's banavior, i.e., an\nanalysis of taa canxlicri^ig nasds at taa clionr\nversus constraints  limitations, and/ or conditions\nt \nin the client's physical and social environment\nwhich contributes to the occurrence of maladaprive\nbehaviors.  Wherever possible, ecological faccsrs\nshould be a di us tad to nesc thtt neads of tha targecad\nclient without impinging on the neads and rights of\nother clients.\n2.  Total haoilitation program.  Tie interactive nature\nbetween and among haoilltation programs and behavior\nrequires an analysis of tha clients total\nhabilitatisn program.  Theretore, tha relative\ncontribution of such programs as speech, recreation   v\nr\nand occupational therapy must be recognized along  i\nvith the need to ensure coordination of all\nhaiailitation programs.\n3.  Behavioral program.  Development of a comprehensiva\nbehavioral program which address tha identified\ntraining needs of the client thrsugn positive\nrainxcrcament procedures.  When applicable, the\nprcgraa vill also describe the leasz intrusive\ninterventicn pracedure to deal with maladaptive\nbahaviors related to clients1 health and safety.\nE.  Priority target behavior(s) will b« identified by the\npsychologist for behavioral intervention.  Tha primary\nconcerns which must be addressed when selecting the\ntargeted behavior(s) for programmatic intervention are:\n1.  Which behavior or category of bahaviars is most\ndisruptive to the clienr?\n2.  Will modification of the behavior(s) enahle the\ncliaat \"3 adapt aore efiecrively ta his/her\nenvironment?\nJ\n\n3«  Are  rssourcas  available  cs  effectively  addrsss  tha\ntargeted  benavior(s) ?\n*,  Haw can  the  ocCsirrsncs  of  the  behavior  be  recorded\nreliably?\nT.  The psychologist will then generate hypotheses regarding\nthe causes of the maladaptive behavior(s) and procedures\nwill be identified and included in the program to\nincrease the probability of socially appropriate forma of\nthe behavior(s) necessary to accomplish the same inferred\nends.  These procedures may taice the farm of:\n1.  Specific training sessions to taach the appropriate\nb«havior(s) , especially it they are not already in\nthe client's repertoire;\n2.  a positive reinforcement program \"overlay*1 of t\nclient • s daily activity schedule as an integral\ncomponent of ALL behavioral programs;\n3.  procedure (a) which addresses the health and safety\nneeds of the client and others; or\n4.  a combination of the above, whichever is deeaed\nclinically appropriate.\nG.  Although not entirely under psychological purview, any\nbehavior therapy programs must pay special attention ta\nthe client's daily activity schedule.  Too much structure\n(i.e., to many activities) may contri-bute to the\nmaladaptive behavior(s) while too little structure (i.e.,\n. • too fsw activities) may, likewise, contribute to the\nmaladaptive behaviorfs) . A functional analysis, as noted\nearliar, =ay indicate chat the same behavior can serve\ndifferent functions in diffarant situations as well as\nfor different clients and that specific activity\ncomponents within the daily activity schedule may need\nexamination as they, too, may be contributing to\nmaladaptive behaviors.\nH.  The design, development,, and implementation of activities\nwithin the context of the client's daily routine is the\nresponsibility of all disciplines woricing together as a\nteam.  These activities should directly address the\nindividual training needs of the clients but say also be\nused as carriers for other forms of training. For\nexample, communication, leisure, and recreational sicills\ntraining can sarve as ends in themselves bur they can\nalso be used to encourage and promote the display of more\nappropriate forms of behavior in a wide variety of social\nsituations.\n\nPlanned. monitoring of tha clients' bahavior aust also ba\nconducted on a regular basis,  mis may taica tha form or\nasSASsmg the interaction pa-crams bewean staff and\nclients as veil as tha cenaviar of the clients\nthemselves.  Psychological Services currently usas tha\nGATOMF (Group Active Traatment Outcome Monitoring Fora)\ndeveloped by Reid & Parsons (1990) to document tie extant\nto wnicii clients are engaged in activities which have\nvarying degrees of therapeutic utility from an active\ntreatment perspective (See Appendix I) .  Tills information\nis than provided co residential unit supervisors to\nenable them to provide the clients viti the most\ntherapeutic environment.\nI. , The psychologist also recognizes that contextual\ninfluences also shape tne eaergenca and display of\n• maladaptive behaviors.  Environmental factors^ such as\ntanpara'cure and ciimacic conditions, over-crowding,\nactivity and naxsa levels, social interaction patrarns\nbetveen and among staff and clients, and Z3.SK demands\ncontrxhute to tie development of the client's behavioral\ntopography.  In particular, the communicative intent of\nmaladaptxve behavior(s) must be recognized, and addressed.\nin a comprehensive aabilitaticn program developed by tha\npsychologist, speech therapist, and/or other significant\nmember of the client's Intardisciplinary Team.\nJ.  An, effective behavior therapy program must also consider\nthe impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on tha\ndevelopment and maim»on» ra  naladaptive behaviors.\nn  ac\nFor example, the dietitian, physician, and other medical\npractitioners should ba consult art to determine the\nsignificance of the client's diet, allergies, and other\nphysiological conditions vnich may be cantributing to the\nnaladaptive behavior(s).\nTie psychiatrist should also be consulted if there are\nany suggestions that mental health issues may be\ninvolved..  If psychotropic medications are prescribed as\nan adjunct to the client's behavioral program, then the\neffects of the medications on the client's behavior\n(i.e., psychiatric features such as hallucinations,\ndelusions, ayperactivity, lethargy, sleeplessness, etc.)\nwill be monitored on a regular basis.  (Sae Appendix J\nfor an example of one monitoring instrument.)\nTherefore, tha policy of NVTC is to focus on (l) the\nestablishment of the most therapeutic social and. physical\nenvironment possible within residential programs participating\nin Title XI3C Medicaid Program for intermediate care Facilities\nfor individuals with Mental Retardation (ICF/HR) , such as\n\n••p\nXVTC.  £2) t*. provision of\n-nrfividuaiized and inzegrataa training\nIs ==n=?der=a to ce active rr a«enc. and <3) **«  P « « « on\nS\nd use of poamive crai-iiaq cachmcues -= inc.-ase c..e\n^!itY  of occurrence of appropriate benavior(s) i=r ti»\nwhile ar cae same cia.. anauii-ig \"e client =  actii.v.\n3\ninferred Bacivmeianal ends.

These\nbehavior  programs  must  be designed  to  increase  individuals'\nrepertoire  or  adaptive  and  socially  appropriate  behaviors  to\nincrease  their  independence  and eventual  re-integration  into\ntheir  communities.\nA variety  of  training  procedures  grounded  in  the  principles  or\nLearning  are  currently  available  to  assist  the  clients  to\ndevelop  more socially  acceptable  behaviors,  thereby  reducing\nthe  occurrence  or  maladaptive  behaviors.  The  basic  underlying\nassumptions  of  behavior  therapy  programs  are:  (a)  behavior\nproblems  are  learned,  (b)  behavior  problems  are  learned\nseparately,  (c)  behavior  pronlems  can  be modified  using  the\nprinciples  of  learning,  (d)  the  behavior  problem  that  a  client\nexhibits  in  a particular  situation  indicates  only  how  that\nindividual  behaves  in  that  specific  situation,  (e)  emphasis  is\nplaced  en treating  the  client's  behavior  in  tie  hera  and now,\n(f)  goals  and objectives  of  behavior  management  programs  are\nspecific,  and  fg)  symptom  substitution  does  not  occur  if  there\nhas  been  an accurate  identification  and modification  of  those  ~\\\nfactors  contribute  tc  the  client's  behavior  problem-  '\nA variety  of  behavioral  and  nonbehavioral  (i.e.,  environmental\nnanipulations)  management  procedures  are  available  for  use\nviti  tie  clients  cr  NVTC.  These  include,  cut  are  not  limited\ntzo tie  fallowing:\nA.  All  clients  should,  participate  ir. on-ccinc  planned\nactivities  vhicn  are  implemented  as  part  of  their  daily\nactivity  schedule.  Individuals  vho  are  engaged  in\n\\  activities,  particularly  activities  they  enjoy,  are  leas\nlikely  to  display  inappropriate,  disruptive,  and  other\nforms  of  maladaptive  behaviors.  These  activities,  such\nas  unit-based  and  structured  recreation  and  leisure,\nspeech  and  language  training,  and vocational  sJcill\ntraining,  also  serve  as  excellent  carriers  or  vehicles\nfor  individualized  and croup  training.  Adaptive  and\n'  targeted  replacement  behaviors  which  can  be  addressed\n;  during  these  activities  include  such  behaviors  as\n:  cooperation,  communication,  compliance,  social\ninteraction,  and  sicil!  acquisition.\nB«  :  Positive  rsinfsreement  systems:  The presentation  of  a\n•'  stimulus  (e.g.,  an  activity  or  commodity),  the  emission\n!  la\n\nof an adaptive behavior  (or \"-a absence or a maladaptive\nbehavior), and tie application oc a reward serves ca\nincrease the raaccurr^nce proeabiiity of that behavior-\nI* the targeted behavior increase in frequency  (or other\nmeasure o: improved benavicr) as a result of regularly\nscheduled data probes, then it is highly probable that\nthe contingent stimulus is reinforcing far tha\nindividual.  Tills fora of response-reinforcement is the\nmost common and most affective method of developing,\nstrengthening, and increasing tha display of adaptive\nreplacement behaviors.\nSince it is not uncommon for an individual to have mars\nthan one targeted behavior which needs to be changed*  the\nbehavior that should be changed first is the one that is\njudged ta be easiest to strengthen.  \"or a variety at\nreasons, including generalization, increased  self-image\nbecause the client; begins ta experience succass,\nincreased numbers of positive staff-client interaction\npatterns, the success of this response-reinforcement\ncontingency procedure will then maJce it easier ta\nstrengthen and/or develop other adaptive behaviors.\n1.  Differential Reinforcement of Appropriate Behaviors\n(DRA) :  A basic procedure in which rewards are\ncontingently given for displays of targeted\nappropriate behavior(s).\n2.  Differential Reinforcement of Other Behaviors  (DKO) :\nA procedure in which a reinforcement is delivered at\nthe end of a specified time interval if the client\nis engaged in any response other than the targeted.\nmaladaptive behavior.\n  ;\n3.  Differential Reinfarcement of Incompatible  Behaviors\n(DRI1 :  A procedure in which a reinforcement is\ndelivered if a specified adaptive behavior cccurs\nthat is topographically incompatible with the\ntargeted maladap-cive behavior.\n4.  Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates of Behavior\n(DRL) :  A procedure in which reinforcement is\ndelivered only if (a) a specified period of time has\nelapsed since the last maladaptive response has\noccurred, or (b) fewer than a specified number of\nthe targeted maladaptive behavior has occurred\nduring the preceding time interval.\n5.  Response Cost:  Response cost generally involves a\ntoken economy sysrem but can be used when any reward\nis given for displays of targeted adaptive\nbehaviors.  The basic concept is that an  individual\n11\n\nloses a reward, e.g., a toicen(s) or other desirable\nitem(s) , vnenever an unacceptable behavior is\ndisplayed.  Response cost does not involve\ncontingent personal property removal or the\n:ic-=icn or privileges.\nC.  Schedules of rewards:  Even if it is possible Co reward\nan individual for each desirable behavior, research has\nindicated taat this procedure may not be the most\neffective in maintaining tie learned behavior.  In most\ncases in which rewards nave been given continuously, the\nbehavior rapidly decreases if tie rewards are removed.\nTais will not occur if, after tie individual has learned\nthe targeted behavior, rewards are given on an\nintermittent or partial basis instead of a conrinuous\nbasis.\nAmong tie four basic reward schedules presented below,\ntae tvo most videly used schedules witn. severely\nhandicapped individuals are toe fixed Ratio and Variable\nRatio scnedules.\n1.  Fixed Ratis (73) reward schedule:  Tie individual\nreceives a reward only arter he has exhibited a\nfixed number of tae targeted behavior.\n2.  Variable Ratio (VR) reward schedule:  Similar to tna\nFH schedule except tae individual does not always\nreceive the reward after a fixed number of correct\nresponses.  A VR-3, for example* zim&na tnat the in\nindividual receives a reward on the average after\nevery 3 correct responses.\n3.  Fixed I.-tarval (71) reward schedule:  Tae individual\nreceives a reward only after exhibiting tae targeted\nbeiiavior aftar a fixed iaterval of time has passed.\n4.  Variable Interval (VX) reward schedule:  Similar to\nthe FT schedule except the individual does not\nalways receive the reward after the same fixed\ninterval.  Rather, the individual is rewarded on a\n:  variable tiae interval schedule which is randomly\ndetermined.  For example  VT~3 means that an\nf\nindividual is rewarded an the average of every 3\nminutes following the first correct response.\nD.  Factors which influence tha effectiveness of rewards.\n1.  Immediacy of t£a reward:  Tne greater tae immediacy\nof the reward following a targeted behavior, Uxe\ngreater the effectiveness of tae reward.  If the\nbeiiavior cannot be immediately rewarded,, a \"bridging\n!  12\n\ncue41 should be used.  for example. staff should say\nor da something to bridge tie time delay becveen tie\nbehavior and the reward.\nConsistently rewarding behavior:  During the initial\nstage of response development, all staff should\nconsistently rsiniorce all targeted, behaviors.  Once\nthe benavior is well es-ca.blisb.ea, the \"remforcemexit\nschedule\" should be changed to a variable procedure\nin which a reward does not always follow the\noccurrence of tne targeted behaviors.\n3.  Combining praise with the tangible reward:\ngive a tangible reward without praise, unless it is\nobvious chat the individual does nor like to be\ncommended.  As a general rule, nontangible rewards\nassociated vith a staff member (e.g., an approving\nlook, verbal praise, pat on that bacic, ate.) are\npreferred over more concrete rewards, e.g., drinics\nand fcod items.\n4.  Schedule of reward:  The contingency between a\nbehavicr and a reward is learned more easily when\ntraining begins at a low level FH. schedule.  As the\nbtthavior becomes more firaly established, the\nschedule can be changed to increase response\npersistence and generalization*\n5.  Type of tangible reward.  Determine what is most\ndesirable for tha individual, e.g., use a reward\nmenu, and begin each session after determining what\nappears zo be most affective at that time.  More\nthan one type of reward may need t3 be used during\nany given session.\ni\n6.  Quality and quantity of reward.  3e sure to use\nfresn and desirable tangible rewards and deliver all\nrewards with sincerity and enthusiasm.  Give edibles\nand liquid rewards in small amounts while other\nforms of rewards, such as activity and physical\ncontact, should be given for correspondingly short\nperiods of time.\n7.  Individual who gives the reward.  The reward should\ninitially be given by someone who is a meaningrul\nfigure in the individual's life.  After the\ncontingency between the client's response and the\nresulting reward is established, encourage stimulus\n(i.e., staff} generalization by assigning other\nstaff members as reward dispensers.\n\n5.  Symbolic reward systams:  Any itsm. person, or event can\ntake on reinforcing properties when it is consistently\nassociated vizi a reward.  The following are examples of\ncommonly used symbolic systems.\n1.  Token Economy System:  This is an \"economy system*\nsince it is based on a \"normal\" monetary system.\nHowever, instead of receiving a dollar or some other\nmonetary amount, an individual receives a token, A\ntoJcen must (a) be something a person can see, touch,\nand count; (b) be in a specific place to see haw\nmany is earned; (c) be exchangeable for actual\nrewards; fd) be obtainable from more than a\ndesignated person(s) dispensing the  tokens; and (a)\nba contingent upon the display or absence of\nspecific behaviors.\nResponse Cost:  once a token economy is well\nestablished, a procedure can be used for placing a\nprice an to.e display of undesirable behavior(s) .\n(See description under \"Positive Reinforcement\nSystems. '•)\nStar  ciiar-zs:  A. oigixly  visible  behavior  ciarri^\naacnnnism  isi vaici  Z&A occurrence  of  targered\nbahaviors  (usually  adaptive  benavlars  or  t^ie  absence\nof  maladaprive  behaviors)  are  hign-Iigiitiad  with, a  )\nsymbol,  e.g.,  vita  a  \"star,'1  \"happy-face, ••  etc.,  on\na  fixed  Interval  schedule.  After  a  specified  mmhir\nof  symbols  are  accumulated,  they  ara  than  exchanged\nfor  a reward-\nother positive symbols: Any items which can be worn\nand displayed by an individual can sarvs. as a\nreward.  \"cr sxampla, a necJclace, bracelet (vrist\nbands , vrisrvatch, etc. ) , or badge (riifaan, butt an,\netc.) can be given to an individual whenever\nadaptive behaviors are exhibited.  The recipient not\nonly \"taovs\" vhat tha symbol represents but, because\nthe symbol is worn by the individual, staff and\nsignificant others can drav attention to the symbol\nand provide additional rewards in the form of\npraise, attention, and social interaction.\nLaval system:  Access to selected activities can\nalso be used to discourage the display of\nmaladaptive behaviors.  For example, a client will\nbagin an the lawes-c level and will ba permitted to\nparticipate in a limitad number of activities, e.g.,\nresidential unit activities only.  Whan he does not\ndisplay any of the targeted maladaptive behaviors\nfor a specified period of time, he is moved to the\n\nnexr lavel vnars he now has access \"  a greater\nvarisry and nuaoer at activities, e.g., off-unit hut\nonly cn-<?raunds activities.  The chird levei can be\nsupervised orf-grounds activities, e.g., selected\ncssmuni ty- oas ed a cciv i t i as.\nTechniques of training  (behavior soaping) include, bur\naxe not iisired ta tie fallowing hierarchy of prompts.\nCompliance wita each, promprs should be appropriately\nreinforced.  The goal is to maJce the client as self-\nsui-ic-anc and independent as passible. i.e.   self-\nf\niniriaricn of tasics and acrivicies wirii no or ainiaal\nring.\n':  l.  Vartal Prompring - Lowesr level of prompring in\nvoicn verbal cues are used cs describe and cromcce\ntie occurrenca of taa targeted adaprive benavior;\nmay also include manual /sign cmnnrnm carion.\n2.  Gestural Prompring  (Modeling) - Snowing tne client\ntne response ts be learned cirougn modeling or\nimitation.\n3.  Shadowing - Following tne client's movements tnxough\ntne desired response vita start's hands in order to\nuse nigaer levels of prompting if necessary.\n4.  Physical Prompting - Gently touching the client to\ninitiate and/ or continue the response in a correct\nmanner.\n5.  Physical Guidance - Physically directing a reaisrive\nclient through the entire response sequence.  If\nphyszcai guidance is used for more than 1 minute,\nthen zz>& procedure is considered to be rastricrive\nand rsquxres the approval or the Behavior Management\nCommittee  (SHC) , Local Human Rights Ccmnu.-rae\n(LSRC) , etc.  (See Appendices B and C, respectively,\nfor descriptions of their goals and functions.)\nAttempts should be made to decrease the degree of\nphysical involvement whenever possible.\nG.  Training procedures for relatively complex behaviors:\n1.  successive approximation:  An individual should be\ntaught a \"complex\" activity in successive steps -\nwith each step gradually leading to an approximation\nof the desired targer behavior.  For example*\ninstead of teaching a person the whole behavior of\nputting on a pair of pants, this complex behavior\nwould be broken down into its component parts.  Each\nparx vould then be taught separately such that one\nL5\n\ncomponent is then chained to the next component\nuntil the wnole behavior is performed\nsatisfactorily.  ;\n2. Behavioral chaining:  The Uniting of behavioral\ncomponents until a complex behavior is learned\naccording ta a predetermined saquenca.  \"or example,\nbrushing taerh can be broken down into a number of\nisolated behaviors which are taught sapararely\n(e.g., pick up toorhhrush, pur pasra on the brush,\ninserr toothbrush inro aouch, ace.) and then\ncombined inro the desired behavior.\nReverse training:  Linking of behavioral\ncomponents in a reverse manner, i.e., the\nterminal component is taugnr firsr and tiien\nsystematically linking eaca component to tie\npreceding component in a stapwise faanion unril\ntne wnole benavior can be perxoraed witaout\ninterruption frcm beginning to end.\nb. Forward training:  appoaita of reverse\ntraining, i.e., taacning a whole behavior by\nlinking the first component with the second,\nthe second with the third, unril all the\ncomponents are linked together to fora the\ndesired behavior.\nH.  orher behavior training procedures:\n1.  Re-diracrion to another activity:  When a client\nbegins to engage in a maladaptive behavior, sraff\nwill inrervene to determine probable causes and\neliainars or reduce the effscrs of the disruptive\ninfluences.  Staff vill then attampt tc encourage\nthe client to either  return to the rsouirad task or\nacriviry, or ta engage in another fora of\nappropriate behavior,  ks a rule, redirection is\nmore successful if the suggested activity is easy to\nperxora and enjoyable to the client.  This is not an\nappropriate procedure if the redirection becomes a\nreinforcer for the inappropriate behavior.\n;  Redirection should be recognized to be a temporary\nmeasure in that the problem or reason for the\nmaladaptive behaviors has nor been directly\naddressed.\n2.  Stimulus Control:  A technique in which a\nmaladaptive behavior (i.e., typically used far\nsrereorypical and perseverative behaviors and nor a\nserious behaviors) is broughr under control, by\npairing it with a particular stimulus under the\nIS\n\ncontrol  of  sraff.  Once cie  behavior  is  lirJced,  with\na. controlling  szisulus,  -hac  srisai.ua  can  tien  be\nsystematically  rsduced  to  decrease  tie  occurrence  of\ntie  maiadaptive  behavior.  Variations  of  this\nprocedure  include  instructianal  central.\n3.  Sactinction:  A procedure  in  vhich  positive\nreinforcement  is  withheld  fallowing  a  maladaptive\nbehavior.  ?or  example,  a maladaptive  behavior  tiat\ndisrupts  normal  and routine  interactions  between\nstaff  and clients  can be addressed  throucn  active\nignoring,  i.e.,  staff  doe* not  atrend  to  or\nrecognize  the  occurrence  or  existence  or  tie  emitted\nbehavior.  Ti.e exception  is  vaen  blocicing  or\nredirection  is  needed Car momentary  stopping  tie\nmaladaptive  behavior  if  tie  intensity  or  tie  episode\nendangers  tie  client  or staxf *  Tie  success  of  tiis\nprocedure  depends  on tie  extreme  csnsistency  of\nwithholding  positive  r*inr\"an=emeirc  whenever  tie\ntargeted  behavior  is  displayed  (otherwise,  a  partial\nrainxorcament  schedule  is  inadvertantly  being  used\nto  maintain  tie  undesirable  behavior) .\n4.  Satiation:  A procedure  vhici  is  generally  viewed,  as\nantitietica.1  to  extinction.  Satiation  involves  tie\ngiving  of  unlimited  access  to  positive  reinforcement:\nvhici  is  believed  to  be m^ jrH-ai.rnng  a  targeted\nmaladaptive  behavior.  For example,  it  a  client\nhoards  or  steals  clothing  from other  clients,  then\nthe  client  would be given  unlimited/excessive\namounts  of  clotiing  with  tie  expectation  that  he/she\nwould  lose  interest  in  tie  items.  ,:\n3.  Modeling  (cr  imitative  learning) :  A. procedure  in\nwhich  ^ie  desiraci  behavior  is  first  demonstrated  to\ntie  individual  and tien  rewarding  tie  individual  for\nsuccessfully  imitating  tie  modeled  behavior\n(generally  accomplished  through  tie  techniques  of\nshaping,  e.g.,  successive  approximation).  Sta£f\nmust  be  sure  that  tie  individual  is  highly  imitative\nand  tiat  tie  person  who performs  tie  modeled\nbeiiavior  is  relatively  attractive  and/ or  prestigeful\nto  tie  individual.\n6.  Individual  counseling:  Tie general  orientation  is\nto  focus  on concrete  and specific  behaviors  commonly\nexpected  in  certain  situations,  e.g.,  what  would\nnormally  be expected  as  a  \"socially  appropriate\nbehavior\"  in  a specific  situation,  psycicdynamic\nparameters,  such  as  attitude,  expectations,  affect,\netc.  nay  also  be  incorporated  into  tie  counseling\nsession  when deemed  appropriate  (i.e.,  based  on  tie\n•  i  .  - • .  17\n\nintended cucccse of tha sessions, functioning' lave},\nof the individual, ace.) .  Individual or group\ncounseling sessions may also be more efiectiva if\nthey are given a sense of importance to both staff\nand client by prescneduling as to tiae and place,\nand, in some cases where attending and/or\nparticipating t^isasaives are issues, rewards,\ntoJcens, and other fsras of incentives may also be\nincorporated tie clients' programs-\n7.  Behavioral contracts:  A vrittan contractual\nagreement betvaen a client and staff in which the\noccurrence af a targeted behavior vill result in a\nreinforcing conditioning, e.g., a client agrees to\nallow staff to inspect his closet for stolen soiled\nclothing in exchange far the privilege ta lacx his\ncloset.  Included in this contract are such items as\nthe identification of specific behaviors to be\ntargeted, staff and client expectations,\nconsequences af targeted maXadaptive behavior, and\nperformance criteria leading to the folfillment of\nthe contract.\nTraining in sJcili acquisition.  The behavioral repertoire\nof many mentally retarded individuals is relatively\nlimited and does not penit them to adequately express\ntheir wants and needs.  Therefore, behavioral outlets  x\noften include inappropriate, disruptive, and aggressive  '\nforms of behavior as well as mere socially acceptable\nforms of expression.  Areas for continued training\ninclude, but are not Limited to the following:\n1.  Communication sJcilis training:  When maladaptive\nbehaviors have been detersuned to serve a\ncommunicative function, che client's haJailitation\nplan, as developed by the Speech /Language Therapist\n. and other Jcey memners of the Interdisciplinary Team,\nmust include plans to taach the client other aeans\nof communication, thereby significantly reducing the\nfunction of the maladaptive behavior.\n2.  Community, social, and leisure sicills training:\nBecause clients vill engage in both acceptable and\nunacceptable behaviors to occupy their time, \"^iey\nmust be engaged in training programs which, vill\nincrease their interests and competencies in\nactivities other than those which focus on salf-care\nand vocational needs.  The Recreation Tnerapist,\nSpeecn Pathologist, occupational Tnerapist, and\nother clinical and residential staff members of the\nInterdisciplinary Team, aust ba involved in these\n. programming areas.\ni  13\n\n2.

Again, the philosophy and policy of\nMVTC is ta emphasize cie posirive faarures raraer tian ciie\nreacrive aspects sucn as liair saczing, nonresrrictive, or\nrestricrive procedures which comprisa only ont saall parr of\nt^ie clienr's overall behavior therapy program.  Several points\nare significant and should be to be addressad within this\ncontext.  i\nA.  Liait-seccing procedure may sarve a variety of functions.\n1.  Lisit -setting procedures sarve to interrupt a chain\nof behavior(s) before they escalate to more intense\nforas of behavior.  As such, they may be }ceyed to a\nclinical knowledge of t^ie client's \"typical\"\nbehavioral sequence (i.e., chain)-\n2.  By intervening earlier in the response chain, more\nintrusive and restrictive behavioral management  ]\nprocedures say not ba necessary.\n3.  LDcewise, lev levels of ma 1 adaptive behavior(s) may\nba amenable zz redirection and limit-setting\nprocedures without having ta rssort ta more\nintrusive ar rastrictive intervention strategies.\n3.  Generally, rastrictive praceduras are defir.ed as any\nprocedure vtiz.cz,:\n1.  Restricts a client's freedom af movement.\n2.  Liaiits access ta activities  objects, or events to\nr \nwhich a client would otherwise ba entitled as a part\nof his/her rights.\n3.  Causes a resistive client ta perform a specific\nbehavior.\n4.  Results in. altered states of consciousness, i.e.,\nchange in the psyche due ta the administration of\npsycaotrspic medication.\nC.  It is along the Lines af perceived restrictiveness of\nvarious behavicral intervention procedures that levels\n;  20\n\n5*\nwere established.

Some procedures are, =y tieir\nvery nature, sors raacr:ci;ve/ intrusive c~an others.\nFor example, verbal redirection into a room to «-» ^ >n\nan aggressive client is less restrictive e^a  the\nn\nuse of a personal restraint to achieve the same end.\n2.  The duration of tie prescribed procedures,  With tie\nsame procedures, in many cut not all cases - shorrer-\nduraticns were designated as less restrictive than\nlonger durations.\n3.

Tlxese procedures,\nunder vernal control, are designated as less\nrestrictive taan tie same procedures requiring\nphysical implementation.\n0-  It is tie position of *TVTC tiat tie following procedures\nare not used to address m&ladaptive behaviors:\n1.  Corporal punishment is not employed.\n2..  Seclusion, defined as noncontingently placing an\nindividual alone in a room or anotner area from\nvnici egress is prevented, is not employed.\n3.  Individuals are not placed in totally enclosed cribs\nor barred enclosures  (otiier tian cribs) .\n4*  \"Papoose beards\" are not used as a fcra cf\nmechanical restraint.\n5-  Individuals served do not discipline otaer\nindividuals served.\nThroughout tie instruction, tie greater the perceived\nrestrictiveness of tie procedure, tie higher tie levels of\nconsent and approval required prior to program implementation\nin order to protect tie above-mentioned interests of tie\nclient.  Nonrestrictive programs require the approvals of the\nIDT and psychologist  (and occasionally the physician and\ndietitian) while restrictive procedures require tie same\napprovals witi tie addition of:  parent/guardian, 3MC (s«*\nAppendix B) , LHRC  (see Appendix C) , and NVTC Director.  Tie\nClient Advocate is informed of all restrictive behavioral\nprogxams.\ni  21\n\nV.  DESIGN AND IXPL£MZ5TTATrON OF BEHAVIOR PROGRAMS\n3ehavioral programs have been demonstrated to be relatively\neffective in addressing a wide variety at behavioral needs,\nranging from tha development and refinement of adaptive and\ncammunir/ living siciils training ta the reduction and\naiiwinagian of highly disruptlv* and aggressive outbursts-\nAll treatment programs are designed, ta use behavioral\nmanagement procedures which are clinical sound and are r.te\nleast rastrictive and intrusive procedures necessary to bring\nabout behavioral change.\nA.  Formalized Behavioral Programs - Behavioral management\nprocedures may be implemented either vita or vithout a\nformal written plan of training and intervention,  in\nsome situations tha psycnologist and IOT vill determine\nthat the identified behaviors do not necessitate a formal\nwritten program and can be addressed, thxougn tze use of\nroutine behavioral management practices, such as those\ncaugnt in pre-servica and in Mandt System training.\nFormal behavioral programs are developed in various vays,\ndepending upon chair need for immediate implementation\nand degree of restrictiveness.  Formal behavioral\nprograms cannot be ianlement without prior approvals.\n1.  A behavioral program using only nrmreatrigtiv\nprocedures requires the approval of the Psychologist\nand the Interdisciplinary Team.  Sowever, other\napprovals may also be required, depending upon the\npurpose, aetncdology, and outcome of the treatment\nprogram.  \"or example, ii edible rsinforcsrs are\npart of the prsgram, zien advice and approvals of\nthe dietitian and physician should be securad.  (Se«\nSection VT; Summary of Programmatic uses oc\nRestrictive Procedures.)\n2.  A behavioral program using restrictive procedures\nrequires the approval of the Psychologist,\nInterdisciplinary Team, Physician, Parent/Guardian,\nBehavior Management committee. Local Human Rights\ncommittee, and NVTC Director.  The Human Rights\nAdvocate is also sent a espy at tha program.  (See\nSection VT.)\n3   In some situation vixen a restrictive program must be\n#\nimplemented prior ts tha next scnmtuled meeting of\nthe BMC  a behavior program can be presented for\nf\nInterim, approval after the approvals of the IDT and\ni  '  :  22\n\nauthorized raoresinucive* are oatained.

Interim approval can be given far\nall procedures except for Time-out.\n4.  Emergency approval for specific treatment procedures\nmay be onrained for 72 hours for macrers of\nimmediate health and safetr/ for che client and loss\nrestrictive alternatives Have been determined to be\nunfeasible.  This is generally a medical cancers and\nrequires tie approval of either the Physician or\nPsychiatrist and a writtan medical order.  ?or\nexample, a mechanical restraint may be ordered to\nprotect a client from serious injury as a result of\na sudden appearance of self-autilation behavior.\n5.  Approvals for cilaical trials must also be obtained\nwhen restrictive procedures are under evaluation.\nOn a short-term basis only, not to exceed 2 veeJcs,\nthe psychologist aiay, for diagnostic purposes,\nimplement any procedure up to but not including\ntime-out or aversive stimulation as a consequence of\ntargeted maladaptive behavior(s).  Approvals\nrequired are the same as those for an interim\nprogram.\nImmediately following sues implementation, the\npsycaclogist will enter an ID note in the client's\nCZS specifying the behavior(s) the client was\nexniiiti^c, the procedure used, date, time, duration\nof the procedure, client's reaction to tie\nprocedure, and ether staff who had assisted.\nB.  Programmatic Use - Restrictive procedures at NVTC cannot\nexist by themselves except in emergency situations  (i.e.,\nNon-Programmatic Uses) .  The use of these procedures\nprogrammatically must be done in the context of an\noverall planned behavior management program as designated\nby the Interdisciplinary Team.\nRestrictive procedures, when used programmatically, are\ndesigned to be used altar- efforts to use nonrestriccive\nprocedures have been unsuccessful or deemed inappropriate\nby the functional analysis.  However, all restrictive\nprograms are generally designed to use less restrictive\nnrocedures as the initial reaction to a behavioral issue.\n12\n\nSfc\nThis  is  based  en rie  assumption  and expectation  that  the\nclient:  will  (1)  eventually\" learn  to  appropriately  respond\nto  early  and  nonnnysical/nonrsstrrctive  farms  of\nbehavioral  interaction  resulting  in  tie  tsrainatian  of\ntie  behavioral  episode.  (2)  learn  to  respond  in  such a\nmanner that  restrictive  procedures  will  be  used  leas\nfrequently  as  training  progresses,  and  (3)  no  longer  need\nrestrictive  interaction  procedures  to  manage  maladaptive\nbehaviors  in  tie  fuctira.\nFor  example,  i*  a  time  out  procedure  is  indicated  by  t\nfunctional  analysis  (e.g.,  tie  client  becomes  disruptive\nor  aggressive  to  gee  staff's  attention),  tie  behavioral\nprogram should  incorporate  tie  use  of  less  restrictive\nprocedures  as  tie  first  stap   suci  as  problem-solving,\nf\nredirection  to  preferred  activities,  limit-setting,  or\nrediraction  to  a quiet  area,  before  tie  restrictive\nprocedure  of  tine  out  is  used*\n3eiavioral  programs,  using  boti  nonrestrictive  and\nrestrictive  procedures  (waici  incorporates  nonciiysical\nand piysical  interaction  procedures  described  by  tie\nMandt System)  nay  be viewed  as  a relatively  temporary\n'•over-lay\"  af  tie  client's  daily  activity  schedule.\n1.  Restrictive  procedures  may be used  only  when  tie\nindividual's  behavior:\na.  Presents  a danger  to  self,  others,  property,  or\nis  severely  disruptive  to  a  therapeutic\nenvironment;  and/or\nb.  interferes  significantly  witi  tie  individual's\ndeveicpmental/sociai  progress.\n2.  Prograamat-caliy,  restrictive  procedures  may  be  used\nonly:\na.  As  part  of  a planned,  approved,  and documented\naabilitaticn  program designed  by  tie\npsychologist  and Interdisciplinary  Team  tiat\nemphasizes  the  use  at  positive  techniques  of\nbehavior  management  and tie  development  of\nappropriate  replacement  behaviors.\nb.  When other  less  restrictive  alternative\nprocedures  have  been  (a)  consistently\nimplemented  and documented  as  unsuccessful,  or\n(b)  treatment  literature  or clinical  judgment\nindicates  that  tie  proposed  intervention\n\nrapresencs the least rastrictive altamativ*\nappropriate z  rasaive the problematic\nZ\nbehaviors(s).\nc.  Vhen they are designed to lead ta less\nrestrictive ways or managing and/or ultimately\neliminating the behavior(s) for which ^hey ware\nemployed and subsequently eliminating tie\nnecessity of restrictive components of\ntreatment programs.\nRe3tr::::ve procedures may nor be used  (a) in the\nabsence of maladaptive behaviors, (b) in\nretribution,  (c) far staff convenience, (d) as a\nconsequence of insufficient staff, (a) in the\nabsence of positive habilitative programming, or (f)\nas a substitute far benaviaral programming.  Ixcspx\nfor valid emergency situations as specified L.i tne\nMonPrcgrammatic Sections, restrictive procedures may\nnot be used vita clients until individualized plans\nhave o^9a developed, reviewed, and approved as\nspecified in tnas instru.cti.on.  To subject a client\nto tnese procedures may be considered abusive and\nreviewed i.i accordance viti NVTC Instruction 5002,\n\"Abuse or Neglect of Resident\".\nNo restrictive procedure with, tile exception of\nmechanical restraint used as a response prevention\ndevice may be used during \"down time\".  Down rime is\nto be defined as periods of time greater t^ian 15\nminutes during vhich the client is not under visual\nbut only under auditory supervision and/or staff are\nnot immediately available- This is ra be\ndistinguished from true \" Leisure cine11 in which\nstaff are directly available to c:ia client and are\noffering options of activities rrcm wnich tiie client\nmay choose.  During periods of \"down time\", if the\nclient begins to exhibit saladaptive behaviors,\nstaff are to utilize the sequence of procedures\ndescribed in Section V.D.3., (Crisis Prevention and\nIntervention Procedures).\nWhen a client exhibits maiadaptive behavior and\nsystematic efforts to eliminate the behavior have\nbeen demonstrated to be ineffective, tne need for\nthe services of a behavioral management consultant\nwill be recommended to the Interdisciplinary Team by\nthe psychologist.\nIn the design, development, and implementation of a\nbehavicr program, the psychologist is responsible\nfor:\n25\n\"IT Hi\n\n=2*\na.

Therefore, adjustments in a client's behavioral\nprogram may need to be made on the baais of the client's\nchanging behavioral topography.  For example, changes in\nthe positive reinforcement procedure aa well as the level\nof intervention may be necessary, e.g., degree of\nrestrictiveness may be changed from a guiat room\nconsequence to an extinction procedure because of a\nchange in the function served by the maladaptive\nbehavior.  All changes must be approved by the\nInterdisciplinary Team and, if the restrictiveness of the\nprogram is increased, additional approvals must also be\nobtained.\nX*  Definitions:\ni\n!\na.  Restrictive behavioral program:  Personal and\nmechanical restraint procedures, time—out,\nmodification of client's rights, psychotropic\nmedication, etc. (see summary table of\nProgrammatic Procedures far mare details).\nb.  Program deferral:  A. temporary short-term\ndiscontinuation of a behavioral program\napproved by the Interdisciplinary Team.\nIf a client has a restrictive behavioral program\n(whether because of a restrictive behavioral\nprocedure or the use of psychotropic medication) ,\nthe  program cannot ba deferred.  L£_ a behavioral\nprocedure far a restrictive program must be changed\n(e.g., a procedure is no longer effective and/or\nappropriate and other adaptive and/or maladaptive\nprocedures used) , then the procedure(s) must be\nincorporated  (i.e., written) Into the behavioral\nprogram far the duration of its usage.\nA nonrestrictive behavioral program can be deferred\nwith the approval of the client's Psychologist and\nInterdisciplinary Team.  However, during the\ninterim, residential staff must be provided with\nclearly writtan intervention procedures to address\nthe client's training needs.  The psychologist must\n31\n' *mr\n\nalso specify zixe. conditions under which the original\nbehavioral program will ba reinstated, raodifiad, ar\ndiscontinued.\n4.  When a restrictive behavioral program is changed\ntoward greater rastrictiveness, all original\napprovals must again ba secured by tie psyciologisr.\nAdditional approvals may be required in some cases\nwhen other1 professional disciplines axe now\ninvolved, sucn as the addition of edible\nreinf orcaments as a part of the training program\n(e.g., tie dietitian's approval should now be added\nto the list of approvals) .  (see summary table of\nProgrammatic Procedures).\n5.  When a behavioral program is changed from being\nnonrastricxive no restrictive, tie standard\nprocedure for securing approvals for a restrictive\nprogram aust be fallowed*\n6.  When a restrictive behavioral program is changed\ntoward lesser rastrictiveness or is now\nnonrestrictive, tne change must be approved: by tie\nInterdisciplinary Team and a memo describing the\nchange farvarded to the chairperson of BHC.\nProgrammatic Procedures (see summary table for approvals,\nconcerns and notifications necessary).\n1.  Calm:  A clinically determined period of time of\nsustained non-agitated behavior not to exceed tan\n(10) minutes.  It's function is to ensure that tne\nclient is, indeed, clinically calm before returning\nto tie activities available ta aim/her and tiereiy\nrsduca cia probability of a ratum ta tie previous\nstate of disruptive behavior.  Duration of calm,\ne.g., calm for 2 mnutes, is to be established\nbased on prior experiences with observations of tie\nclient.\n2.  Overcorraction:  Any type of repetitive actions\nimplemented as a consequence of behavior.\nOvercorrsction procedures shall not be prescribed\nfor* a period in excess of 3 0 minutes.  The total\namount of time per day a client spends in\novercorraction procedures- shall not exceed tvo (2)\nhours within a tvanty-four (24) hour period for\nrepeated incidents without prior approval of tie\nDirector of NVTC.\n32\n\na.  Graduated Restitution:  AeCurr.;.ig the\nenvironment tc it normal state with, ~«a minimum\npnysical intrusion necessary.  For example,\noicicmg up ciotimg, placing tiea on hangers,\n.  and returning tiem to tie ciossc after thay\nhave bamn tirewn out by tie individual.\nb-  Graduated Positive Practice:  Repeating the\nappropriate form of tie behavior with tie\natinimum pnysical intrusion necessary.  \"or\nexample, as a consequence of deliberately\nspilling or rftrowing food during a meal as an\nintentional act of misbehavior, a client will\nnot only perron restitution but also wipa tie\ntable and clean tie immediate area after a\nmeal.\nc.  Graduated Contingent Exercise:  Repeating a\ntopographically dissimilar response with\nrespect to tie targeted maladaptive beaavior(s)\nwiti tie minimum pnysical intrusion necessary.\nFor example, as a consequence of ^-^appropriate\nsexual touching of another client or staff, a\nclient will touch his toes ten times for a\nspecified period of time.\nd.  Graduated Negative Practice:  Repeating the\ntargeted maladaptive behavior with tie minimum\nphysical Intrusion necessary.  For example, as\na consequence for constantly moving furniture\nresulting in the disturbance of other clients,\na client will bs guided through tie act of\nmoving furniture tar a specifiad period of\nrime.\nContingent Exclusion:  Temporary removal cf a client\nfrom ongoing activities as a consequence cf a\nmaladaptive behavior.  As with all programs, but\nespecially with contingent exclusion procedures, it\nis necessary to specify those conditions under which\na psychologist's review will be done.  This is to\nensure that tie client is not excluded unduly from\nsignificant portions of training for unnecessarily\nprolong period of time,  with tie exception of \"On\nunit During Program Time,\" \"Unit Restriction,\" and\n\"Contingent Access to Activity, \" no order aay exceed\none hour.  See Section rv.B.9.   Extension of\nf\nProcraamatic Procedures.\nAs a general policy, exclusion procedures are not\nused in response to self-injurious behaviors  (SIB) .\nTiere are exceptions, however, when exclusion may be\n33\n\nan appropriate response to SIS as determined by\nfunctional analysis and the clinical judgment of the\npsychologist and IDT and approved by BMC and LHRC.\nFor example, exclusion may be an appropriate\nprocedure if the SIB is motivated by attention and\ndoes not escalate to an intensity where personal\nrestraints are required to prevent possible tissue\ndamage.\nIf exclusionary procedures are used, as reactive\ninteractions to physical aggression to people and\nthe client begins to display SIB, the psychologist,\nin conjunction with the physician, must clearly\ndescribed the contingency procedures in the behavior\nprogram to address this situation.  Tnat is, the\nprogram must indicate the conditions under which\nstaff will intervene, e.g., when to ignore the\nbehavior and when they will physically stop the SIB.\na.  In Room:  Tae client is escorted to his/her ovn\nbedroom or to a vacant room with the minimum\nphysical intrusion necessary.  P&ysical\nprocedures should not be used to maintain tie\nclient in the designated room.\nb.  In-Seat:  Tne client is escorted to and sea-ted\n(but not held in) with tne minir™\"\" physical\nintrusion necessary, tfonpaysical procedures\ncan be used to keep the client seated.\nc.  Off-Unit:  The client is escorted off the unit\n(e.g., to a hallway or outside the building)\nwith the minimum physical intrusion necessary\n(MOTE:  If this procedure is utilized the\nwrittan narrative ts tne behavior program\n.  :  should include documentation that the client is\ncapable of utilizing this procedure in a\npositive manner, i.e., not running away or\nresorting to displacing anger/aggression to\npassersby or property.)\nd.  In Corner:  The client is escorted to a corner\nof the room with the minimum physical intrusion\nnecessary.  The client is maintained in the\ndesignated area through verbal /gestural\nprompts, physical presence, and other\n  , nonphysical procedures.\n;\ni\ne.  Quiet Roes/Area:  The client is escorted to a\nneutral unlocked room/area other than his/her\nbedroom with the minimum intrusion necessary.\nThe room/area should be ventilated, veil lit,\n*  34\n\nfree  of  safety  hazards,  and unless  otherwise\nccncr^uidica ted,  equip pea  vizi  a aac.

Tie room\nshould be ventilated, wail lit, free of  safety\nhazards, and. unless otiervisa ccnzraindicated,\nequipped vith a mat.\nTime out from reinforcaaant vith staff  outside\ntie room:  Tie client is escorted to a time out\nroom with tie least amount of physical\nintrusion necessary.  Tie client is prevented\nfrom leaving tie time out room vith a hand-held\nlacking bar (i.e., tie door becomes  unlocked\nwhen che bar is released) rather cian a keyed\nlocic.  Tie room is ventilated, veil lit, free\nof safety hazards, and, unless otherwise\ncontraindicated, equipped viti a mat.\n(1)  Tie individual vili be released after- a\nrescribed period of calm, not more t»ftan\n-minutes in. tie room.  However, if.it is\nclinically indicated that a longer\nduration is necessary to achieve calm\nand/or significantly increase tie\n'  probability that f-artier aggressive\nepisodes can be reduced, tien tie\ninterdisciplinary'taam, viti tie approval\nof BMC, LHRC. and ether approving bodies,\nmay extend the duration far specifically\nidentified clients to not acre tian 60\nminutes in tie room.  This change is tien\nreflected in tie client's formal  program.\n(2)  Staff must remain immediately outside the\ndoor at all times far purposes of\nunobtrusively monitoring tie client.\n(3)  criterion for use and discontinuance of\ntime-out procedure, i.e., plans to move to\nless restrictive means of modifying  tua\n-•  targeted behavior, must be clearly\nspecified in tie client's program.\nOn unit during program time:  Tie client is to\nremain on the unit for only the duration of\n35\n\nj  program tiae in which he/she was intentionally\nI  disruptive or refused to attend, e.g., remain\n|  on the unit rather than go. to recreational\nI  activity such as a dance or swimming.\ni\ni.  Unit restriction:  As a consequence of specific\nmaladaptive behaviors, e.g., consistently runs\naway ta avoid doing his/her assigned chores,\n;  tiie client is required to remain on tie unit\n.1  for a period of time greater than tiie duration\nI  of program tiae where he/sha was disruptive but:\ni  not to exceed twelve (12) hours.\ni\nj;  Contingent  access  to  activity:  A client's\n!  access  to  preferred  activity  not  related  ta\n|  training  needs  or goals  is  contingent  upon\ni  demonstration  of 'targeted  adaptive  behavior(s)\n;  or withholding  targeted  maladaptive  behavior\nI  for  a specified  period  of  time,  e.g.,  not\nI  becoming upset  for  an entire  veeJc  when  asJced by\ni  staff  to  bathe  will  entitle  the  client  ta  go an\na  field  trip  to  the circus.\n4* Meal Modifications:  Altering  any condition  of  a\nclient's  normal meals,  including  the  amount\nconsumed,  where the meal  is  consumed,,  and when tha\nmeal  is  consumed when the modifications  are  part  of\na'planned  behavioral  program-  Behavioral  programs\ndo  not  employ techniques  that  may result  in  denial\nof  nutritionally  adequate  diet.\na.  Limitations:\n(1)  Access  to  meals  may not be  used\ncontingently  as part  of  the  behavioral\n:  program.  The client  must  ba  allowed\n|  reasonable  access  to  his/her  meal  on a\n•j  non-contingent  basis  at  the  prescribed\ni • •  time.\n(2)  If  a client,  through  his/her  own behavior,\n,  refuses  the meal,  staff  must  attempt  to\n! .  ascertain  the reason(s)  for  the  meal\ni  refusal.  If  the client  simply  did not\n, j  want that  particular  meal,  then,  short  of\ni  danger to  health  and depending  on the\n|  developmental  or functioning  level  of  the\nj  client,  staff  is  under no obligation  to\ni  maice special  arrangement  ta  feed,\n\n(3)  Zl a client should reiusa or miss :vo  (2)\ncsnsecinve meals, the unit: physician must\nbe notified by the unit staff and ba\nI  responsible far monitoring tie client's\nnutritional intaice and overall health.\nEach aieai missed or refused must ba\ndocumented by the unit staff.\n(4)  I* a client is involved in a behavioral\nprocedure prior to and extending zirougii\n  mealtime, unit s-cafi aust arrange for izhm\n;\ni  meal to ba provided ts tie client aitar\n.  the procadure is tarminated and tne client\nis reruraed. ta a state of calm.  if ti«\nnaai vas originally served off the Unit:,\nthe meal say subsequently be offered  again\nat the off-Unit site or brought bacJc to\ntha Unit vita the client, whichever is\nmore appropriate.\nb.

Medical treatment, i*\nwarranted, will taica precedence over the\nuse of behavioral consequences.\n(4)  Althougn the duration in mechanical\nrestraints varies from case to case,\ndepending upon such conditions as natura,\nseverity, and function of the maladaptive\nbehavior,  environmental/residential\nlimitations, behavioral history, and\ndocumented learning history and potential\nof the client, all individuals in\nmechanical restraints must be released  for\na minimum of 10 minutes every 2 hours and,\nunless asleep, provided with an\nopportunity for motion, exercise, liquid\nintaJce, and toileting.\n(5)  Procedures:\n(a)  As a response consequence, the\nmechanical restraint functions as an\nanalogue to timeout from\nreinforcement procedures.  The\nv  duration in restraints will be  \"until\ncalm\" to .a ™»y^wiwH of 1 hour,  For\nexamole, a hairnet may be contingently\napplied \"until cairn\" for headbanging\nbut not to exceed 1 hour.\n(b)  As a response prevention procedure, a\nmechanical restraint is\n•;  differentiated frcm a medical\n•  protective device on the basis of tie\n1  degree of control the client has over\n  the behavior(s) for which they are\n;\n:  being used.  A. helmet worn to protect\na client from passible injury due to\n>  seizures is a medical protective\n?  device? similarly, a helmet to\nprevent pica  (after possible medical\ncauses such as nutritional deficits\n::  have been eliminated) is a\n•  behavioral/medical mechanical\n!•  restraint.  Tne former helmet usage\n•  is not subject to this policy whereas\nthe latter is.\n44\n\ntil\nZn addition, '-a«n used as a raspons*\nprevention procedure, the duration ir*\nrestraints aay vary frcm \"until calm\"\nto a maximum of 2 hours, £•<?•, a\nhelmet far pica may be applied as a\nconsequence \"until calm\" or applied\nj  noncontingently for 2 hours vnere\npica is perceived by the pnysician to\n=  be a heal Hi. and safety :ssue.\n(c)  Screening:  A special casa of us* of\na oecnanical restraint in which a\ndevice is placed on the client but\ndees not interfere vita normal\nscheduled activities or training.\nFor example, a surgical Bask, is\nplaced over the client's moutii fox a\nlioitsd period of tima as consequence\nS  \\  for spitting.\n9.  Aversive Stimulation:  According to the 1587\nstandards or ACDD  (Accreditation Council on Services\nfor People vita Developmental Disabilities) ,\nnAversive  conditioning refers to tae application,\ncontingent upon tne exoibition of maladactive\nb«ha.vior   of startling, unpleasant or painful\nr\nstimuli, or stimuli tnat have a potentially  noxious\neffect*1  (page 65).  ACDD also states taat:  (1)\naversive conditioning \"'aust also be limitad to\nsituations in vnicn the interdisciplinary team, the\nbehavior management committee, and the human rights\ncommittae concur that to withhold the procedure\nvould cause Irreparable harm to the individual\"\n(page 67) , and (2) the procedure is used only vti&n\ntie client's behavior \"precludes his or her\ndevelopment, and less negative procaduras have, in\nthe izimediata cast, been documented to be\nineffective ia reducing or eliminating this\nparticular behavior'1  (page 72) .\nHVTC does not subscribe to the use of aversive\nconditioning as a treatment procedure.\nLO.  £xtension of Programmatic Procedures:  Although most\norders cor programmatic procedures do not exceed one\nhour, it may be necessary, from time to time,\nespecially during the initial phase of program\nimplementation, to extend the duration of the\nprocedure, based on the client's behavior, i.e., not\ncalm.  If, toward the end of the hour, the client\ncontinue to exhibit signs of not being calm, staff\n45\n\nshould contact the following- for authorization to\nextend the procedure: (1) the unit  psychologist;\n(2) on-call\"psychologist; (1) Chier of Psychological\nServices; (4) physician; (5) NVTC Director, or; (S)\nActing WVTC Oirector.\nTlie extension will be for only one additional hour\n\"until calm,\"  The extended procedure must be\nterminated once the client returns to a calm state\nor at the end of the additional hour regardless of\nthe client's behavior, whichever occurs first.  In\nextreme emergencies where ic is unequivocally clear\nthat the client will be a significant threat to\nhim/herself or others, the Psychologist should be\ncontacted for consultation.\nFollowing the extension of programmatic procedures,\na Crisis Management Documentation Form must be -\ncompleted and forvarded tc the Program Manager\nwithin tventy-four hours or the first wording day\nfollowing the incident.  Th.e crisis Management\nDocumentation Form will then be routed first to the\nProgram Manager and the CTnit Psychologist and then\nto selected members of the Interdisciplinary Team,\nchairaan of BMC, RisJc Manager, NVTC Director, and\nthe Resident Advocate for their review and comments.\nE.  Non-programmatic Uses of Restrictive Procedures\nX.  Collection of Baseline Data:  During this period, it\nmay be necessary to try a variety of behavioral\nprocedures not only for the purpose of managing the\nclient and deal with situations as they arise but\nalso to collect data to document each behavioral\nepisode.  Baseline data is essential in the event of\nfuture program development: and evaluation.\nProcedure which may be used during this time are:\ni ft. Restitution\nb.  Quiet room/area, bedroom, Ln-seat until calm\nc.  Physical guidance\nd.  Personal restraint until calm (requires\ncompletion of the Crisis Management Form) .\n2.  Day ta day procedures:  Data and documentation arm\nnot required in these situations as they are\nstanding procedures which, are available to staff to\n46\n\nhelp  bring  a given  (low  frequency)  behavioral\nsituation  under  centre!.  These  procedures  include:\na.  Restitution\nb.  Quiet: room/area or bedroom until calm\nc.  Removal frcm che group unril calm\n3.  Crisis Prevention and Management Procedures:  On\nan emergency basis, certain restrictive procedures\nmay be implemented in order ta manage a client's\nbehavior that clearly poses a threat to self or\nothers.\nIt is critical to distinguish between procedures\nused in crises management and t^osa used as part of\na planned behavior treatment programs.  A behavioral\ncrisis is an exceptional event which occurs so\ninfrequently tiar a systematic plan of intervention\nhas not been formally developed.  Restrictive\nprocedures in tnis context may not: be used as an\naversive consequence but rather strictly as a method\nof calming the client and managing his/her behavior.\nWhen a client becomes highly aggressive, there is\ntypically a reason (with the possible exception of\ndually diagnosed individuals) . In most cases, there\nare early signs that he/she is stimulated and is\nbuilding up ts .an aggressive outburst.  Therefore,\nan attempt at early intervention designed ta prevent\nthe outburst or deal with it before it becomes\nviolent is necessary and expectsd before restrictive\nprocedures are applied.\nCrisis management may be conceptualized as a\nsequence or procedures that progressively become\nmore restrictive for the client.  Interactions with\nthe client should begin with nonphysical procedures\nwhenever passible (i.e., the graduated approach as\ndescribed by the Handt system) .  Tne point at which\nstaff enter into this sequence will depend on the\nbehavior(s) being exhibited by the client.\na.  Preventive/Supportive intervention\n!  (1) A client's behavior may typically include\n|  an unusual departure from his/her normal\nj  routine, e.g., agitated behavior such as\n|  complaining, screaming, pacing or possibly\nj  withdrawing from others.\n\n(2)  Appropriate staff response at tiiis stage\nincludes a variety of supportive\nsucii as:\n(a)  Atrampting ta determine whetner  or\nnor the client is in physical\ndiscomfort, e.g.,  ill or injured, and\nrequires medical treacaenc;\n(b)  Talking to the client to find out\nwhat is wrong, helping ta\nproblem-solve, or simply calm tie\n••  client with a soothing tane of vaica;\n(c)  Providing riie clienr vith  sufficianr\npersonal space and reducing  excessive\nenvironmental stiaulacion, suci as\nnoise and activity immediately  around\ncne client;\nC<i)  Redirecting tne client into a\nspecified activity tnat ne/she can\neasily perform and tiat will maintain\nhis/her interests;\n(a)  Presenting requests in a positive,\nsupportive manner and giving  tne\ni  client more fleacibility where\npassiisle in meeting tnese requests;\n(t)  Keeping other clienrs away-who may\ntease   bother, or somehow  stimulate\nf\ntae agitated client or away until  the\nclient is calm.\nLimit setting  intervention\n(1)  client's behaviors may typically  include a\nvide range of behaviors  such as  continued\n r\nagitation, tantrums, verbal aggression,\nthreats of aggression, or isolated acts at\naggression to self., others or property.\n(2)  Appropriate staff responses at tiis  stage\ninclude:\n(a)  Identifying the most effective\nstrategy to manage the individual,\n•  including using the right person(s),\napproaching the client in a\n\\  nonrnreatening manner, using a calm\n\ncentre lisa voica, respecting tie\nclient's personal space, etc.;\n(\"o)  Identifying and iaieiir.g tie client's\nsehavior and/cr aaoticnal state far\n>  him/her and suggesting an immediate\ncourse of accisn, e.g., \"(Name),\nyou'rs upset so lac's sit down and\n:  •a.JJc about what's troubling you.11\n(c)  Identifying appropriate limit-a art lag\nprocadura(s) fsr ^e  client given\ntie client's background, previous\ntraining and experience, and tie\npresent situatisn.  As a rule of\nthumb, tie client snould be offered\n2-3 options in order to perait\n•  him/her soma centre! as ta what vill\nba done.  For example, the client aiay\nba given tie instruction \"hands\n'.  down, \"or \"Let's go to your room,11 or\n\"lat's go to tie quiet room.11\nIf the client is exrxihiting rasponsas\nrelated to aggression to self, a\nlimit-setting procsdure designed to\nstop tie behavior mi.gh,t be \"Hands\ndown\".  On the otier hand, It tie\nclient is exhibiting a response\nrelated to aggression to others, a\nsuggested liait-setting procedure\naright be, \"Let's go to your room-\"\nHowever, i* tie client is exhibiting\nresponses related to aggression to\nproperty, a liait-setting procadure\nmight be, \"Let's go to tne quxet\nroom.\"  Tie duration of any\nlimit-setting procedure would be\nuntil tie client is calm.\nIf tie client refuses to comply witi\ntie limit setting prompt, bacicup\nassistance should be obtained and\ntie client once again given tie\nprompt.  Tie staff who began tie\nprocedure should generally continue\ntie exchange unless tiere is clear\nindication tiat anotier staff would\nbe more effective,  if tie client\nagain .refuses to comply witi tie\nlimit setting prompt, he/she should\nbe physically guided into tie prompt\n4§\n\n\"3ft\n(e.g., hands biociced at tie side,\nescorted to ream, or escartad to\nquiet area) .  Follow tirouga ac this\nstage is important; a ciienr siiculd\nnot be give a specific prompt unless\ntiie prompr can be carried our.\nCrisis Intervention Procedures\n(1)  The client's behavior is out of control  in\na manner that is harmful to self  or\nothers.  Tie behavior at tiis stage is\ntypically characterizad by repeated acts\nof aggression or self spouse and the\nclient' s inability to respond to\nsupportive or iiait setting procedures.\n(2)  Staff Responses:\n(a)  Crisis Management:  As always, tne\ngraduated procedure as prescribed by\nthe Mandt system of staff-client\ninteraction should be used.  For\nexample, consideration snauld be\ngiven to such factors as the need to\nseparate the client from tie group\nf \nwhether or not the types and number\nof staff are optical to manage tie\nclient, what fora of  staff-client\ninteraction is needed, etc.  Only\nwhen deemed necessary for the\nprotection of the client, others, or\nsignificant property, should physical\ninteraction procedures based on the\nMandt system ce used to manage the\nclient saxaiy.\nphysical interactions must use\ntie least amount of  external\nmanagement ta brin? the crisis under\ncontrol.  If there is any  significant\ndeparture f ram tie - prescribed\nphysical interaction procedures, this\nmust be described In tie Crisis\nManagement Documentation Fora  (see\nAppendix El .\nIt is especially important to note\nhere that tie Handt system of\nphysical restraints should be used in\nwhich tie intent of tie procedure is\nto manage tie aggressive  behavior\nSQ\n\nusing tie least amount of external\naanageaent necessary zz deal viti tie\nclient's behavior.  If necessary,\n^u.s may involve noiding cie arms,\nbody, and legs in sues, a way as ts\nensure a safe and effective\nrestraint.\nThe client should be regularly\nassured tiat he/she will be released\nas soon as he/she calms down and is\nquiet for a couple of minutes.\nHowever, staff should not attaapt ta\nyell or shout instructions over tie\nclient's loud or inappropriate\nverbalizations but wait until tie\nclient is able to understand what is\nbeing conveyed by staff.  When tie\nclient is quiet for a full tvo\nminutes, he/she should be released\nand tien slowly reintegrated into tie\non-going activity.\nIf,  (a) staff believes tiat physical\nrestraints is inappropriate or\nineffective, i.e., imminent tireat of\ninjury to staff or client or (b) thm\nclient remains highly agitated after\napproximately 30 minutes of Crisis\nManagement and is showing no signs of\ncalming, tie unit psychologist should\nbe contacted.

He  frequently\ninitiates independent leisure activities and particularly\nenjoys such activities as looJcing/reading magazines and\nbooks, writing and drawing, watching television, movies,\nfoods  and cooJcing, swimming, biking,  walking,  a-ncl soc\nhops, and visiting with family-\n\nBEHAVIORAL PROGSAH 1/03/95\nReg.\nVh  has displayed a vide range of maladaptive behaviors\nin  the  past  beginning  in  early  childhood,  inducting\nperseveration,  appcsicional  behavior,  inappropriate\ntoileting,  agitation,  hallucinations,  aggression  to\npeople  and  property,  and  self-injurious  behaviors.\nHowever, since ••• began receiving Clozapine in 10/93, he\nhas  shown  a  ramaricahle  reduction  in  the  frequency,\nintensity, and duration of these aaiadaptive behaviors.\nThis improved behavior was maintained through 1994 and he\ncontinues to do well despite occasional occurrences these\nbehaviors  (see Figures on pages 5 and 6 for frequencies\nof  targeted  maladaptive  behaviors  and  intervention\nprocedures) .

It\nshould also be noted that the majority of the behavioral\n1 episodes consistently occur during the p.m. shift.\nIn addition, since many of his episodes include more than\n: a single maladaptive behaviors and multiple interaction\nprocedures, i.e., one behavior may merge into the next,\n| the duration of each type of maladaptive behavior is not\npossible  to  determine.

The intensity of each episode of maladaptive\nbehavior ranged from 1-5  (i.e., l=low 5 5=*high) with, an\naverage of 4.0 per episode.\nPrevious Interventions: ^^g has a history of maiadapcive\nbehaviors  dating  from  early  childhood.  He  has  been\nenrolled in several residential and educational programs\ndesigned to address the needs of individuals with mental\nretardation  who  are  also  diagnoses  with  psychiatric\ndisorders.  A. variety  of  training  and  intervention\nprocedures  have been tried  to address his  maladaptive\nbehaviors, particularly his self-injurious and aggressive\nbehaviors to others.\nAn assessment of previously used interventions suggests\nthat the most effective program involved a combination of\npreventative,  training,  and  rsactive  procedures  which\nincorporated in vivo training and protective and calming\nprocedures.\nTraining and reactive procedures which have been used in\nthe  past  when ••  became  agitated  or  upset  included\nproblem-solving,  verbal  redirection,  relaxation,  and\nLimit-setting.  He has been on a token economy program,\nDRO  for  absence  of  aggressive  behaviors,  and  social\nreinforcement for displaying appropriate/replacement/ etc.\nbehaviors using various DRI schedules.\nWhen flpl became  aggrassive,  reactive  procedures  have\nincluded behavioral procedures (i.e. , personal restraints ,\n2-point wrist restraints, 5-points supine bed restraints,\nand a \"papoose board\" as well as emergency psychotropic\nmedications.  At one point, M IV  aggrsssion rate was so\nhigh  (i.e. , almost  continuous  at  times)  that  medical\norders were written to remove him from the other clients\non his Unit and place him in 4-point bed restraints for\nextended periods of time.  On many occasions, MM  would\nhave  difficulty  calming  down  within  SO  minutes  and\nprogram  extensions have been required.  For a graphic\ndisplay of various intervention procedures used over the\npast tvo years, please refer to the preceding graph.\n\nBEHAVIORAL  X3TSKVESTIOH  PROGRAM  1/03/95\n(Reg.\nA  behavior  which  has  not  been  displayed  since\napproximately  L989  is  running  away  from  wherever  he\nhappened to be, e.g., home or NVTC.  3ecause of potential\nhealth issues associated with his diabetic condition, (l)\nM  was always accompanied by staff whenever he was off\nthe Unit, (2) an educational program was implemented to\nteach ^^  what foods he should and should not eat, tne\nhealth consequences of eating the wrong roods, the need\nfor  insulin, etc., and  (3) a 2 4 hour Unit  restriction\nwhenever M  left the Unit without staff permission.  The\nonly component remaining to the above plans at this time\ninvolves his dietary needs.\nII.  FOTCTIOHAL ANALYSIS:\nBased on a review of m ^ B l ^B  written records prior to his\nadmission to NVTC (s.g.  home, DeJaxnette, C7TC, Western State\nf\nHospital, etc.), staff reports, personal observations, and an\nexamination of his behavioral data, his maladaptive behaviors\nappear to be motivated by a combination of factors.\nA.  Psychiatric Diagnosis:  The large majority of  • • • ••\nbehaviors appear to be motivated by conditions associated\nwith  his  diagnosis.  He  is  a  relatively  nervous  and\nanxious individual who appears to have many autistic-liJce\nbehaviors.  According  to  a  10/16/39  psychiatric\nevaluation, IBl \". . . . suffers from autism.  He manifests\nthe classical triad of severely  impaired  interpersonal\nrelaticnsnips,  severe  impairments  of  ability  to\ncommunicate  eifactively,  and  a  rigid  repertoire  of\nabilities  zo  interact  in  the  world.\"  His  current\ndiagnosis is:  Axis I - Autism;  Axis II - Mild Mental\nRetardation;  and Axis XII - Diabetes.  See records  in\nResident Records for previous diagnoses.\nB.  Sensory  Stimulation:  Many  of  his  infrequent  Self-\ninjurious  behaviors  (SIB)  are  reported  to  occur  when\nappears  to  be having  a relatively  good  day,  is  alone\n(usually in his bedroom or bathroom, and with no clear\nantecedent conditions.\nC.  Attention:  Agitation and aggression may occur when his\nrepeated  attempts  to  attract  staff  attention  are\nunsuccessful.\n\nBEHAVIORAL IOTSHVCTTXaN PROGRAH  1/03/95\n\"  ^  (Rag. #745)\nD.

Interruption, at on-going activities:  Occasionally, JI|M\nmay  become  upset  when  he  is  engaged  in  a  preferred\nactivity  and  does  not want to  stop, whether  it  is  a\nrecreational or vocational activity.\nIZZ. DESCRIPTION OF TARGETED BEHAVIORS:\nA.  Definition:\n1.  Inappropriate Urination - Intentionally  urinating\nin inappropriate areas, such as in his bed or on\n:  the floor in the bathroom, bedroom, dayruom, etc.\n2.  Agitation - Behaviors which typically precedes more\ndisruptive  behaviors,  including:  Significant\ndilation of his ayes, red nose, facial contortions,\n'  constant  flipping  cf  his  glasses,  odd  physical\nmovements,  increased  motor  activity,  threatening\ngestures, oppositicnai behaviors, and inappropriate\nvocalizations.\n3 .  Aggression  .; ceooie - Out of anger, any behavior\nwhicn could result m  significant injury to others,\nincluding:  Hitting, Jcicicing, punching, pinching,\nscratching, using an object as a weapon, etc.\n4.  Self-Injurious  behaviors  -  Out  of  anger,  any\nbehavior  vUica  could  result  in  bodily  injury  to\nhimself, including:  Facial hitting, pinching self,\nheadbanging, hitting or kicking self, etc.\n5.  Ri-sJc/Implication of Targeted Behaviors:  ^B has clearly\ndemonstrated  his  ability  to  be  highly  disruptive  and\naggressive toward himself and others to the point where\ninjury  occurs  unless  the  behavior  is  stopped.

On  some  occasions, when  the\n:  noise  and  activity  levels  increase,  particularly\nwhen other clients become disruptive, he may become\ndistracted, annoyed, and agitated and begin to have\nbehavioral difficulties.  Therefore, Staff  should\nattempt  ta  maintain  a  relatively  quiet  and\n;  therapeutic  environment  while  at  the  same  time\n:< i raspcnd to his attantional and training needs.\n2.  Independence  -  3ecause  fl^  is  a  very  capable\nindividual who is able to initiate and complete the\nmajority  of  his  self-care  and  community  living\n:  activities,  he  should  have  some  control  over  as\nmany of these activities as possible.\nStaff must also not only enable M  to maintain his\n:  current  level  cf  independence  but  develop  and\nrefine additional social and  interpersonal sJcills\n; :  to prepare him for the eventual move  into a  less\nrestrictive  environment,  preferable  into  a\n,:  community-based residential program.  To this end,\n:  HI  should be offered a variety of community-based\nactivities, e.g., recreational programs, shopping,\nrestaurants,  etc.  (particularly  since  he  enjoys\n\n3EE&VT0RAL PROGRAM\n1/Q3/9S\nReg.  #745)\ngoing  into  the'  community) W currently\nparticipates  in  community Awareness\nSpecial\n0lympics, and ociier off-tfnit activities\n(e.g., is\noccasionally  involved  in activities  with peer\ngroup in 3uiiding 3).\n3 •  Individualized  Choices  -  Vft  has  clearly\ndemons-era, tec  his  ability  to  aaJca  appropriate\nchoices  in a number of areas, including  those  in\nleisure and community  living.  Therefore,  to  the\ngreatest  extent  possible,  he  should  be  directly\ninvolved  in  aaJcing  choices  whenever  they  axe\npossible,  such  as  his  clothing  as  veil  as\nvocational,  recreational,  seals/snacics  (if\npossible) , and  leisure  activities  for  his  daily\nactivity  schedule.  Since  food  has  historically\nbeen  a  source  of  difficulty  for flft, he  should\ncontinue  Zo  receive  information  and  training\nregarding  his  dietary  needs  as  well  as  the\nrationale for any iced restrictions.\n4.  Attention - flBPl need for attention continues to\nbe  regularly  displayed.  This  is  particular ly\n •  evident in h^s effort ^3 communicate with staff and\n:\nwill frequently become perseverative if he does not\nimmediately receive a response from staff.  Staff\nshould  talk  with Bft whenever he wants  to  talk,\nregardless of the topic.  At the same time, staff\nroust respond to him in an appropriate manner, i.e.,\nanswer  his questions  but redirect and  set  limits\nwhen he begins  ~c cerseverats.  Therefore,  staff\nshould  periodically  communicate  or  interact  with\n^•l in such a manner that each event is clearly and\nappropriately initiated and terminated.\nB.  Positive Program Components:  Adaptive Behaviors will be\nreinforced  within the context of fll^B daily  activity\nschedule.  Staff  attention and/or  interaction  will  be\nused as the primary form of reinforcement but, in some\nsituations, other more tangible reinforcers will be used\n(Note:  all  foods /drinks used  as  reinforcsrs  must  be\napproved  by  the  Dietitian.)  The  use  of  response\ncontingent procedures appear to be the mast clinically\nappropriate procedure at this time.\n12\n\nBEHAVIORAL  ISTERVEHTION  PRQGRAH  1/03/95\n(Rag.

All  interventions  are  not  to  exceed  60  minutes\nwithout the approval of a Psychologist.\nA.  Kaladaptive  Behaviors:  Reactive  Procedures.  A.11\ntargeted maladaptive behaviors will be addressed  using\n(1) a graduated system of interaction ranging from verbal\n14\n\nBEEAVTORAI* PHQGXAH 1/03/95\nRag.\nand nanphysical nethads to physical interactions as well\nas (2) the specific procedures designed to address eacii\ncategory of identified behaviors.\nI-  Inappropriate  CJrina-cion - This  behavior  tends to\n,  occur between the time •• goes to bed at night and\ni  waJcing up  in the morning.  Staff  will  verbally\nprompt him to use the bathroom when he gets up at\nany  time  during  the  night.  However,  if\" he\n; ,  inappropriately urinates, either in his bed or on\n•; !  the floor, he will be requested to restitute using\n;'  verbal and gestural prompts.  After  the araa  is\nclean, he may return to bed.\n2.  Agitation - Staff should immediately intervene in a\nI  supportive manner and attempt to problem-solve and\nredirect  W H Ht  when  he  becomes  agitated  and\n!  begins  to display  precursors  to  aggression  (see\n'''  definition above).\n;  A  graduated  system  of  interaction  will  be  used\nbeginning  vies  (1) Nonphysica.1  techniques,  i.e.,\nproblem-salve, instructed relaxation, retiirect, and\nlimit-set.  (2) If he remains agitated, he will be\npromptad to sit an a mat until  calm.

Crisis Management:  Crisis management procedures will be\nused at any time or place, as described in Section VT:\nPHYSICAL  INTERACTION  TECHNIQUES, if ttB'S behavior is\ndetermined to be a potential danger to himself or others.\nThe Crisis Management Form must be completed as soon as\npossible if crisis management procedures are used.\nVI.  PHYSICAL OTTH?ACTION TECHNIQUES:  Restraints\nIn the event that personal and/or mechanical restraints are\nrequired to assist in the management of Ws  behavior, as\nprescribed in either (1) his behavioral program or for (2)\nhealth and safety  reasons, i.e., Crisis  Management,  these\nprocedures will be based an the Mandt Svstem and implemented\naccording to DMHMRSAS and MVTC policies.  Since restraints are\nnot a part of Ken's  formal program, all restraints must be\nconducted and processed as a form of Crisis Management.\nIf a restraint is needed to manage Mfc's behavior, staff will\nfirst implement a personal restraint.  If, according to the\njudgement cf the shift supervisor or the in-charge  person,\n^B's  condition  (i.e., his emotional stats, severity of his\naggression,  etc.) can be cettar  managed  with  mechanical\nrestraints,  then  a  Psychologist  aust  be  contacted  far\nconsultation and then approval.  It is recommended that the\nPsychologist  be notified  within  10 minutas  following the\ninitiation of the personal restraint.\nThe interactive procedures as well as the guidelines described\nbelow  were developed  according to feB's current  behavioral\nneeds.\nA.  Personal Restraint:  The nature of the restraint should\nalways be dictated by the individual, i.e., sufficiently\nflexible  within  specified  limits  to  consider  ^fcy s\npsychological  responses to restraints, the behavioral\ntopography, his strength, size, ate. Therefore, whenever\npossible, the restraint should be conducted according to\nthe fallowing preferred sequence of alternatives.\n:  is\n•wrr\n\n3£HaVT0RAL  IHTSRVEHTXOtf  FHOGRAH 1/03/95\n(Rag.\nNumber Staff  -  The  minimum  number  of  staff\nrsquired to implement a personal restraint is tvo\ntrained staff with sufficient physical interaction\nskills to deal with ••'£ sizs and strength. And,\nif  additional  staff  are  present,  then  their\ninvolvement will be directed by trie restraint \"team\nleader.11\nRestraint  Position  -  The  preferred  restraint\nposition is standing because it will make movement\ninto a quiet  area or his bedroom,  if necessary,\neasier and safer.  As indicated by David Mandt, \"it\nmay become necessary to restrain a person viio has\nbecome aggressive or out-of-control on the ground.\nWe feel it is best Zz try to restrain tie person\nstanding up first;  however, you may not have any\nchoice  (The \"andt  Svsten, page  4-14) .\"  This is\napplicable to M B.\nThe  order of preferred restraint  positions is as\nfollows:\n(1)  Standing 2-3 person  restraint\n(2)  Sitting down (2-3 staff)\n(3)  Lying  down  (at leasr  3 s-caff and preferably\nwith Wm  lying en his side)\n5odv Mass - The most typical method of initiating a\nrestraint is to bring the individual' s body  under\ncontrol by securing  \"body  mass.\"  Therefore, the\nmost experienced star* should be the person to make\nthe  first physical contact to at laast manage his\nbody.  The  second  staff  will  then  assist  in\nmanaging  the arm(s)  and, if necessary  because of\nthe presence of other clients or activities,  begin\nmoving I^B into the Quiet  Room.  If MM  drops to\nthe  floor, the 2nd/3rd  staff  will  be  responsible\nfor managing the legs.\n4. Management  o f  Arms / Leas  -  As  a  general  rule,\nphysically  manage  only  as much  of ifc' s body as\nnecessary to protect him and staff  from harm.  If\n•A  is retrained in a standing position, staff must\nbe  aware  that he will  attempt to bite,  headbutt,\nand kick  (however, his legs do not need to be held\n\n3EK&VT0RAL  INTERVENTION  PKOGHAH  1/G3/95\n(R«g.  5*745)\nif he is properly position away from other people) .\nIf the restraint is conducted in a sitting or lying\n! • • position, \"hen the lags must be held  by at  least\n:  one staff.\nThe  order  of  preference  in  securing MA's  arms,\nregardless  of  the  restraint  position,  is  as\n; .  follows:\n(1)  one-arm standing/seated/lying down\n;  (2)  Two-arms standing/seatad/lying down\nB.  ', Mechanical  Restraint:  If  mechanical  restraints  are\nrequired,  per  Crisis  Management  policy,  then  the\nfollowing adjustments will need to be made:\n1.  vnpHor- f  staff - A Tnir.-i-rmrm f  3 staff should  be\n o  O\ninvolved.  The first step involves the management\nof MB  by placing him in a personal restraint.\nThe  second  step  will  involve  a  lift  and  carry\nprocedure.  One staff will place ^M  in a  2-ana\n  restraint  while  the  other  2  staff  will  securely\n;\n[  hold each of his legs.  Care must be taken  sines\n§•• will attempt to headbutt and bite.  l^fe will\nthen be lifted and carried to his bed.\n2.  Restraint Position - SB's bed will be prepared as\nfollows:  (a) A pillow positioned at the headJaoard\n~z prevent headbanging when ••• is transferred  to\n:  the bed.  (b) Wrist and ankle restraints will  be\nattached to the bed.  (c) The chest rastraint will\nbe nearby for easy access when needed.\n;  Mi will be placed in a supine position (facing up)\non his bed.  The restraint will be maintained whila\nthe  lags  are  secured  with  anJde  cuffs  by  each\nstaff.  The staff will then take each of •••'s arms\nwhile  the  restraining  staff  removes  her/himself\n:  from SB.  Each arm will then be secured with wrist\ncuffs.  The  chest  restraint  will  be  added  to\nprevent MH  from bouncing on his bed.\nStaff must be able to put two fingers between Mfc\nand the wrist and ankle restraints to ensure their\n13\n\nBEHAVIORAL  IOTEKVENTION  PSOGRAH  1/03/95\n(Reg.  ^745)\n:  proper application.

SCHEDULE OP PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe behavioral program should be implemented at all times and\nall locations except in emergencies situation when adjustments\nmay to be made for programmatic and/or for health and safety\npurposes.  For example, in the event of an emergency,  e.g.\nfirs, all formal interaction procedures will be  immediately\nterminated and ^m  will be escorted out of the building.  If\nhe  remains  disruptive  and/or  becomes  aggressive,  and  is  a\nthreat to people,\" property, or himself, a physical restraint\nprocedure as describe above will be implemented  (Section VT -\nPHYSICSi I2TT2SACTICN TSCHNIQtJES) .

The training package is developed to orient\nnew employees to their jobs; to list and document ability, skills\nand knowledge necessary to perform their duties.  It will provide\nthe  trainee  with  enough  tachnicai  information  and  practice  to\nbecome a successful Developmental Aide, capable of performing all\nrequired duties and responsibilities.\nIn  addition,  DCCTP  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  an\nemployee's performance evaluation.  The supervision should review\neach  of  the  competency  items  to  ensure  that  the  employee  has\nmaintained competency in each required area.\nThe  Direct Care Competency Training  Program  has two parts:\nfirst, gix  (6) Learning Areas that are knowledge and information\nrelated to the Developmental Aide jobs description:\n1.  Orientation and Training\n2.  Philosophy\n3.  Personal Care, Health, Hygiene\n4.  Active Treatment\n5.  Documentation\n6.  Policy\nThe Learning Areas have objectives, questions, resources and\nperformance  criteria  which  may  be  a  written  test  or  return\ndemonstration  cf  the  task.  Each  trainee  will  be  required  to\nsuccassfuily complete each Learning Area.\nThe second part is a list of competencies which are jcb duties\nthat are task analyzed.  They are divided into four (4) groups:\n1.  Provide Health Related Care\n2.  Staff/Client Interaction\n3 .  Provide/Maintain Safe Living Araa\n4.  Implement Program Plan\nThe  task analyzed duties are used as resources  in Learning\nAreas 2 and 4.  The criteria for passing Learning Areas 3 and 4 is\nmastering the competencies by return demonstration of the task in\nthe situation or a simulated* situation as verbally recalling \"Che\nprocedure.  The supervisor/trainer would document whether- or not\nthe trainee performs the task in an \"acceptable\" or \"unacceptable\"\nmanner.  The  trainer  should  indicate  under  \"comments\"  if  the\nemployee needs additional practice, training, or needs to attend\nPre-Service Training Classes in related areas.\n14\nII •\n\nWhen the trainee reports to his/her unit af-tar pre-service\ntraining, he/she will have a blue notebook which includes the six\n(6) Learning Areas.  There is a book of competencies already on\neach unit.  The Training Coordinator will have trainees work on and\ncomplete  Learning  Areas  l and  2 while  in training  class.  The\ntrainer will then work exclusively on Learning Area 3 until he/she\nsuccessfully completes the performance criteria.  Since Learning\nArea 3 is so time-consuming, the maximum amount of time allowed to\ncomplete it will be three (3) months.  Then go on in sequence to\nthe  other  Learning  Areas  4,  5,  and  6;  maximum  amount  of  time\nallowed for each Learning Area will be one month.  The trainee then\ncan take up to six (6) months to complete the program.\nThe  trainer  will  receive  a  notebook  containing  a  Unit\nCompetency Checklist, casts, answer sheets and task check sheets.\nThe trainer will administer the performance criteria, be it written\ntests, performance check-offs, or both and document the results on\nthe Unit Competency Checklist.  This replaces NVTC form 162 Unit\nTraining Checklist.\nWhen the training is completed, the Unit Competency Training\nChecklist  is reviewed and signed by the Team Leader and  Program\nManager and then sent to the Training office to be forwarded to\nPersonnel with the Pre-Service Training Record.\nDCCTPDR5  15\nl III1\n\nATTACHMENT\n11\nUNIT7C\nTRAINING STATUS OF STAFF\n30-\nO4\n25 r\n20 iL\n<\n15-\"\n03\n10\"\nc\nLU 5r\ni\n0-\nMANDT CPR ANNUAL PRE-SVC\nSTRAINED  ^  NOT TRAINED\nUNIT7C\nTRAINING STATUS OF STAFF\nO\nCD\nz\nLU\nCJ\nc\nLLJ\nC\nMAND\" CPR ANNUAL  PRE-SVC\nSTRAINED  ^  NOT TRAINED\nTWT -rr\n\nAnnual Re-Training Requirements for IWTC Staff\nPolicy:  All employees will receive mandatory re-iraming in designated topics on an\nannual basis.\nPurpose:  The purpose of this re-nraining is to ensure competence in Hgffn^H criricai\ntopic areas.

Ordinarily, the medication having the most favorable benefit vs. side effects profile in\nthe lowest effective dose for the shortest period necessary for each individual will be utilized.\nSound medical judgment will be the primary decision-making criterion, both under ordinary\ncircumstances and for determining exceptions.\nPROCEDURES\n1.  Interdisciplinary assessment and decision-making processes, tempered and guided by\nsound medical judgment, shall be employed in the initiation, adjustment, and withdrawal of\npsychotropic medications.\n2.  Decisions must be supported by objective data, to the extent practical, as well as by\nsubjective observations and opinions, and must conform with sound medical judgnu\n3.  Involvement of diem, family, and/or authorized representative will take place, as specified\nbylaw.\n4.  Review by the Behavior Management Committee and by the Local Human Rights\nCommittee will take place, as specified by NVTC Instruction 5302.\n5.  The Medical Plan for Psychotropic Drug Use, Form #159, which also includes consent\nforms, will be completed by the psychiatrist or primary physician: the plan and consents\nwill be updated at least annually on form #159A.\n6.  Emergency uses of psychotropic medications will be handled according to NVTC\nInstruction 5302.\n7.  The clinical course and dosages for ail clients receiving psychotropic medications will be\nreviewed at monthly interdisciplinary medication review conferences by a psychiatrist\nand/or by the client's primary physician.\n3.  Monitoring by direct client observation for adverse side effects of psychotropic\nmedications by nursing and medical staff members will regularly occur, at least as often as\nthe quarterly physical assessment and tardive dyskinesia assessments by registered nurses\nand the annual physical examination by primary physicians; tardive dyskinesia assessments\nwill be conducted according to HS Standing Order #28 and Nursing Services SOPs # 28\nand 30.\n\n9.  Clients manifesting signs or symptoms suggesting possible new psycfaotropic medication\nside effects will be promptly referred for medical, psychiatric, and/or neuroiogic evaluation\nand treatment, if indicated.\n10.  Candidates for medication reduction and withdrawal may be individually identified\naccording to the guidelines in 1 through 3, above, and such adjustments planned if the\nanticipated benefits to the client appear to exceed the risks of decompensation, in the\njudgment of the consulting psychiatrist.\n11.  An audit of the quarterly tardive dyskinesia screening program will be conducted semi-\nannuaily by the nursing department and the results submitted to the quality assurance\ncommittee.\n12.  An audit of psychotropic medication prescribing practices will be conducted annually by\nthe pharmacy and therapeutics committee and the results submitted to the quality\nassurance committee.\nMichael B.

Purpose:\nThe purpose of the Quality Management Program for NVTC is\nto establish, organize, and implement an effective program through\nmonitoring, evaluating, and documentation to improve the quality of\nlife for each individual served.\nII.  Goals:\nThe goals of the NVTC Quality Management Program are as\nfollows:\nA.  To organize and facilitate the systematic monitoring\nand  evaluation of the quality and appropriateness  of consumer\nservices and client care and treatment in relation to established\nstandards of care and practice.\nB.  To identify problems/risks and areas for improvement\n.rough gathering, aggregating and analyzing data.\nC.  To resolve identified problems/risks and to seize\nopportunities to improve consumer services and client care and\ntreatment.\nD.  To  document  the  process  of  problem/risk\nidentification and quality improvement through resolution and\nfollow-up.\nE.  To coordinate and integrate quality management into\nthe ongoing operational activities of all clinical and support\nservices.\nF.  To minimize the potential for liability to NVTC\nrelated to the provision of professional services.\nG.  To encourage the communication  of  information,\nfindings and quality  improvement  efforts between services,\ndepartments  and committees  so as to increase clinical and\nadministrative knowledge and to positively affect consumer services\nand client care and treatment.\nH.  To evaluate annually  the effectiveness  of the\nQuality Management Program.\n\nIII.  Background:\nA.  Quality Management is a dynamic process of monitoring\nand evaluating the habilitation and care programs and services\nprovided to consumers and clients so as to produce strategies for\nchange and improvement.  Quality Management processes generally\nadhere to a problem solving module.  Data from a variety of sources\nis utilized to identify existing problems, risks or potential for\nimprovement.  Once problem  areas, risks or  improvement\nopportunities are identified information is translated, assessed\nand analyzed so as to formulate a strategy for change.  This\nproblem-focused approach to Quality Management has five components:\n1.  Identification of existing/potential problems,\nrisks or potential for improvement.\n2. Assessment to determine the cause and scope of\nproblems, risks or barriers to improvement.\n3.  Development and implementation of a corrective\naction or quality improvement plan.\n4. Monitoring and follow-up to determine if desired\nresults and outcomes have been achieved and sustained.\n5. Documentation and communication of the results\nand outcomes of the quality management/ improvement  effort to\nappropriate management, staff and consumers.\nB.  It is the intent of NVTC's Quality Management Program\nthat issues be addressed and resolved at the lowest possible level.\nPrimary responsibility for providing quality services lies with the\nindividual service provider and the responsible unit, team,\ndepartment or service.  Each unit, team, department and service\nmust insure that services are developed in accordance with specific\nregulations, standards, policies, procedures, agency instructions,\nand Departmental Instruction No. 74 (QA/RM Program).\nIV.

The Quality  Management Committee  shall  monitor\nthe  effectiveness  of  the  actions  taken  by  conducting  follow-up\nevaluations.\nC.  Quality  Management  Activities  of  Management  and\nStanding  NVTC committees.  Several  NVTC committees  have  been\nidentified  whose principle  functions  involve responsibilities  that\ncan have a significant  impact upon the quality  of  the NVTC service\ndelivery  system  in  one  capacity  or  another.  The  chairpersons  of\nthese  committees  have  been  charged  with  the  responsibility  to\ndocument  and  report  activities  and  projects  that  have  been\nundertaken  and  which  are  deemed  to  have  Quality  Improvement\nimplication.  Reports  of  these  activities  and accomplishments  are\nto  be  forwarded  to  the  Quality  Management  Director  on a  quarterly\nbasis  so  that  they  may  be  incorporated  as  a  part  of  the\ncomprehensive  NVTC quality  effort.  The  Committees  are  listed\nbelow:\n1.  Admissions Committee\n2.  Behavior Management Committee\n3.  Ethics Committee\n4.  Research and Development Committee\n5.  Resident Records Committee\n6.  Infection Control Committee\n7.  Safety Committee\n8.  Workers Compensation Review Committee\n9.  Clinical Practices Review Committee\n10.  Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee\n\n11\n11.  Habilitation Committee\n12.  Equal Employment Opportunities Committee\n13.  Others as Identified by the Quality Management\nCommittee\nD.  TQM/CQI projects and project leaders are assigned by\nthe NVTC Director as deemed appropriate.  The Quality Management\nCommittee shall serve as resource individuals and as facilitators\nfor the Project Leaders should those leaders desire to utilize the\nassistance available.  The Quality Management  Director shall\nmaintain a file of various TQM/CQI models and methodologies and\nshall provide any required training or guidance to TQM/CQZ Team\nLeaders and/or Project Teams as indicated.  TQM/CQI Project Leaders\nshall provide quarterly reports to the Quality Management Committee\nrelated to project status and quality improvements accomplished as\na result of the activities of the effort.  (See Appendix A)\nE.  Unit-Based Habilitation and Active Treatment Program\nContinuous Quality Improvement Activities.  Unit service delivery\nsystems are evaluated on a periodic basis utilizing the concepts of\nthe TQM/CQI method in accordance with the certification standards\npublished by HCFA for Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally\nRetarded.  This program audit is conducted by the NVTC Quality\nfanagement Committee but is accomplished with the participative\ncontributions of Unit Managers, Clinicians and Direct Care Staff.\nThe procedures for the conduct of these Unit-based reviews and\nQuality Improvement efforts are as follows:\n1.  The Quality Management Committee chooses a Unit\nin which to conduct a certification standard related survey and\ninitiate a Continuous Quality Improvement effort.  Several factors\nare utilized to make this selection:\na.  Quality Management  indicators and trend\nanalysis.\nb.  Senior management preferences.\nc.  Results  of reviews  from  previous\nevaluations.\nd.  Invitation by the Unit managers and/or\ntreatment team.\n2.  The Quality Management Committee evaluates all\ntrend data available so as to provide a focus for the Unit survey.\nData to be examined includes but is not limited to:\na.  Event Report data.\nb.  Employee injury data.\nc.  Human Rights complaint data.\n\n12\nd.  Client restraint data.\ne.  QMRP reports.\nf.  Client Record System audit data.\ng.  Active Treatment and Staff  Interaction\ndata.\n3.  A general meeting  is conducted  among the\nQuality Management Committee, the Unit ID Team and Residential\nServices staff.  At this meeting the Unit Team is advised that they\nhave been selected for a Continuous Quality Improvement effort and\nare provided with the details and procedures that will be utilized\nby the Quality Management Committee during the conduct of the\nsurvey and improvement  effort.  The trend data that had been\npreviously analyzed by the Quality Management Committee shall be\ndiscussed and management, clinicians and Unit staff are encouraged\nto assess the quality status of the Unit.  Participants are also\ngiven the opportunity to address and identify any obstacles that\nprevent improvement of care and treatment.\n4.  The Quality Management Committee conducts a\nseries of on- unit and at-work observations, record reviews and\nprogram audits. Numerous observations are made on all shifts and\nfull program audits and records reviews are conducted of between\n20-40% of records. A Quality Management Client Review Checklist\ndeveloped from the HCFA regulations and guidance to surveyors has\nbeen formulated and is used to conduct these audits.  Audit results\nare shared with the ID Team principals as they occur.\n5.  The Quality Management Committee conducts a\nteam meeting and identifies a few to several areas where problems\nand potential for improvement as identified in program audits, unit\nobservations and in staff interviews appear to be concentrated.\nThe identified areas are then chosen as recommended projects for\nUnit Team TQM/CQI Focus Group processing.  The Quality Management\nCommittee also identifies some possible resource individuals from\namong  its own Committee as well as from other NVTC resources\noutside of the Unit being reviewed. In addition, some preliminary\nideas for addressing problem areas are devised.\n6.  The Quality Management Committee meets with the\nentire Unit Team again and presents the results of the audit\nprocess, the identified potential TQM/CQI topics and the initial\nsuggestions for how each topic area may be improved.  Input is\nsolicited from the Unit Team Members and TQM/CQI Focus Group topics\nare finalized.  A leader for each Focus Group is identified and\nUnit Team members are permitted to choose the Focus Group with\nwhich they would like to participate.  A member of the Quality\nManagement Committee is assigned to each Focus Group and additional\nresource individuals are identified and invited to participate.\n7.  Each Focus Group, consisting of a mixture of\nmanagement staff, clinical staff, personal care staff, members of\n\n13\nthe Quality  Management  Committee  and  additional  resource\nindividuals meets, utilizing the TQM/CQZ methods discussed earlier,\nfor a period of about four to six weeks for the purpose of\nidentifying process changes required in their project area.  Each\nFocus Group shall prepare a series of suggestions/recommendations\ndesigned to achieve Quality Improvement related to their Focus\nGroup topic.\n8.  The Quality Management Committee and the Focus\nGroups then meet as a whole and each Focus Group presents its\nrecommendations.  Recommendations are discussed and expanded upon\nby the whole group and the several recommendations are synthesized.\n9.  Many of the initial recommendations can be\nimmediately  implemented,  and if this is deemed  appropriate\nimmediate change is instituted,  other recommendations may require\nthe approval of higher level NVTC Management and if this is the\ncase the recommendations are taken to that level by the Quality\nManagement Committee. Likely, many of the recommendations will have\nto be adapted and redesigned.\n10.  Focus Groups shall continue to meet to advance\nmore recommendations and to refine implementation.  The Unit Team\nwill eventually assimilate the accomplishments and recommendations\nof each Focus Group and develop a fluid and on-going Continuous\nImprovement Plan for the Unit that will implement  all of the\nrecommendations. The Unit Team shall address the Improvement Plan\nperiodically at clinical and administrative meetings to insure that\nrecommendations and efforts are not neglected.  The Unit management\nshall revise the Continuous Improvement Plan as accomplishments are\nachieved and as new areas for improvement are identified.\n11.  Unit management shall provide copies of updated\nContinuous Improvement Plans and reports of efforts and activities\nrelated to the Quality  Improvement  project to the Quality\nManagement Committee quarterly.\nF.  Other Formal Program or Service Reviews. These types\nof reviews are non-routine evaluations.  They are normally a very\nformal process and they require the development  of a specific\nevaluation format.\n1.  Topic Selection.  Topics for formal review are\neither recommended  by the Quality Management  Committee  or are\nassigned by the Director of NVTC.  These reviews are indicated\nwhen:\na.  There is statistical evidence to indicate\nthat the problem of concern occurs frequently.\n\n14\nb.  The problem is so severe (though perhaps\nnot widespread) that the facility's clients or resources are at\nsignificant risk.\n2.  Development  of Assessment Criteria.  The\ncriteria for selecting performance standards to be assessed must be\nsuch that the elements that are essential to producing quality\ncare, treatment or service are evaluated.  The criteria selected\nshould be outcome based to the extent that this is possible,\nhowever, process (what the provider does and the degree to which\nthis conforms to accepted  standards) shall not be overlooked.\nStandards selected are to be ratified or confirmed as essential by\nthose who are responsible for the service being evaluated.  This is\nnecessary, not only to be fair to those responsible for the\nservice, but also to enlist their support for and commitment to the\nprocess.\n3.  Program  and Documentation  Review.  Case\nTreatment  or service delivery  is evaluated and reviewed in\naccordance with the established criteria to determine what, if any\ndeficiencies, problems or opportunities for improvement exists.\n4.  Identification of the Problem or Improvement\nOpportunity.  Once identified,  problems or  improvement\nopportunities shall be briefly, but fully stated.  Measures of the\nextent, location and frequency of the difficulty shall be utilized\nto complete this process.\n5.  Problem Analysis.  The responsible unit,\ndepartment  or service must then determine what has caused the\nproblem.  No corrective action plan can be successful unless it is\nappropriate to the cause of the difficulty.  The three most common\ncauses of problems are defects in system processes, insufficient\nknowledge and deficient performance.  Each of these areas must be\nevaluated.\n6.  Corrective Action Plan.  Once causes of a\nproblem have been identified,  a corrective action plan can be\ndeveloped and implemented.  The unit, department or service shall\nfully document the procedures which shall be instituted to bring\nabout resolution.  The plan shall identify corrective actions to be\ntaken, assign a responsible individual and establish the suspense\ndates for the completion of the actions.  The unit, department or\nservice may find that it does not have the resources available to\nfully correct deficiencies noted.  Should this be the case,\nadditional corrective action requirements shall be coordinated with\nthe Quality Management Committee.\n7.  Follow-Up.  The unit, department  or service\nshall provide the Quality Management  Committee with regular\nprogress reports related to the implementation of its improvement\nplan.  The schedule for the submission of these reports shall be\n\n15\nestablished on an individual basis as determined to be appropriate\nby agreement between the unit, department  or service and the\nQuality Management Committee.  Continued monitoring and evaluation\nshall be implemented by the Quality Management Committee or by the\nappropriate Senior Staff Committee representative to insure that\nthe approved correction plan has been implemented  and the\ncorrections implemented have produced the required change.\nVI.  Quality Management Program Evaluation:\nThe effectiveness of the NVTC Quality Management Program\nmust be formally evaluated on an annual basis during the period of\nAugust - September by the Quality Management Committee and by the\nSenior Staff Committee to insure that the collective effort has\nbeen comprehensive, cost effective and that it has achieved the\ndesired goal of enhancing the quality of services provided by NVTC.\nThis evaluation must also assess the degree to which the annual\nperformance objects of the Quality Management Program have been\nrealized.  The results of this annual program evaluation shall be\nfully documented and utilized to revise the NVTC Quality Management\nPlan and to establish objectives for the following year.\nVII.  Quality Management Program Documentation:\nA.  Annual Report.  The Quality Management Director is\nrequired  to submit  a formal Quality Management  Program annual\nreport to the DMHMRSAS Office of Quality Assurance. This report\nmust be submitted  in October of each year and consists of the\nfollowing elements\n1.  A report of the activities and accomplishments\nof the Quality Management Program realized during the preceding\nsemi- annual period.  The report submitted shall be a synthesis of\nall of the efforts, activities and accomplishments  generated by\neach of the Quality Management Program components detailed in this\nplan.\n2.  The results of the annual formal NVTC Quality\nManagement Program evaluation of effectiveness.\n3.  A copy of the revised NVTC Quality Management\nPlan.\n4.  A listing of the planned objectives to be\naccomplished  by the NVTC Quality Management Program during the\nfollowing year.\nB.  semi-annual Report. The Quality Management Director\nis required to submit an interim Quality Management Program report\nto the DMHMRSAS Office of Quality Assurance semi-annually.  This\ninterim report must be submitted in February of each year, and as\n\n16\nin the case of the annual report, consists of a compilation and\nsynthesis of the activities and accomplishments realized by each of\nthe NVTC Quality Management Program components.\nVIII.  Quality Management Plan Revision.\nThe NVTC Quality Management Plan shall be reviewed\nannually.  Any revisions shall correspond to and be in accordance\nwith the findings produced during the annual Quality Management\nProgram evaluation.  This does not preclude the plan from being\nrevised and improved at any time that circumstances warrant.\nAll Quality Management Plan revisions shall be submitted\nto the NVTC Director and to the DMHMRSAS Commissioner as they are\nmade.\nIX.  Confidentiality:\nAll information, both verbal and written, pertaining to\nthe NVTC Quality Management Program shall be held confidential and\nis considered to be the sole property of this facility as part of\nDMHMRSAS.  This information  is protected from disclosure by\nspecific exclusion from the Freedom of Information Act and is\nconsidered as privileged communication under the terms of the Code\nof Virginia, Section 8. 01-581.16 and Section 8.01-581.17.\nRevised:  March 1995\n\nAPFEMDXX A\nTOTAL QUALITY XAMAOZMEBT /CONTINUOUS QUALITY  IMPROVEMENT\n(TQM/CQI)\nTQM/CQI is the terminology applied to the method of providing for\na  fluid,  ongoing  and  continual  enhancement  of  the  quality,  as\ndefined by the customer  (those who use and/or are impacted by the\nservice), and achieved through a systematic analysis of the service\ndelivery  system  processes  by means  of  a team  approach  in which\nmanagement  leads and  facilitates  employees  who  are empowered  to\nmake  a  significant  impact  upon  the  nature  and methods  of  the\nprocesses utilized.\n1.  Elements  of a TQM/CQI  Approach.  Numerous  TQM/CQI\nprograms and models have been advanced.  Most of them  incorporate\nseveral, if not all, of the following elements:\na.  Customer Oriented.  In the TQM/CQI concept quality is\ndefined  as meeting and/or exceeding the customers' expectations.\nWhen this is accomplished the customer is satisfied that the system\nhas  done the  correct  things  in the  correct manner.  Key  to  the\napproach is being able to:\n1)  Identify  who  the  customers  are.  In  general\nCustomers are the ultimate target or beneficiary  of the agency's\nservice.  Customers may  also  be those who  assist  in making  the\nservice available to the primary target and even anyone within the\norganization who receives or utilizes the work of another employee\nor team.  simply  stated,  the customer  is anyone  who uses  or  is\nimpacted by the service.\n2)  Identify  the  critical  expectations  of  the\ncustomer.  This means that the focus of Quality Improvement efforts\nmust be at the point where services are actually delivered to the\nsystem's users.\n3)  Keep in touch with the customer.  This means\nknowing  them  and  viewing  all  that  is delivered  from  their\nperspective.  Any outcomes that are measured must be the outcomes\nthat are experienced by the customer.\nb.  Team Approach. The TQM/CQI concept  emphasizes  the\nteam approach to problem solving and decision making.  The value in\nutilizing the team approach is that it allows the introduction of\na broad knowledge base to the problem  identification  and problem\nsolving  process.  Ideally, Team Members will be assembled  from\namong a broad range of employees who have expertise in all of the\nseveral  components  of the  system  being  evaluated.  The  team\napproach allows for the pooling of skills, talents and knowledge so\nas to  permit  the  identification  of more,  if not  all,  of  the\nhindrances  to Quality  Enhancement  as well  the  introduction  of  a\nwider  range  of  solution  options.  With  proper  guidance  and\n\nfacilitation,  teams  can often  tackle  complex  and  chronic  problems\nand generate  effective,  permanent  solutions.\nc.  Management  Leads  and  Facilitates.  The TQM/CQI\nprocess  is  dependent  upon management  being  willing  to  forego  more\ntraditional  directing  roles  and  assume  a  leadership  style  that\nsupports  and  facilitates  the  group  process.  Some  of  the\nrequirements  for  management  in  the  TQM/CQI  process  include  the\nfollowing:\n1)  Adopt  the  TQM/CQI  philosophy.\n2)  Demonstrate  a  support  for  and  give  direction\nto  TQM/CQI process.\n3)  Demonstrate  a  participative  attitude  in  the\nprocess.\n4)  Encourage  ideas  and theories  for  improvement.\n5)  Provide  resources  and  other  assistance\nnecessary  for  the  process  to  be  successful.\n6)  Institute  a program of  education,  training and\nself-improvement  for  employees.\n7)  Make  changes  based  upon  the  recommendations\ngenerated  in  the  process.\nd.  Employees  are  Empowered.  The  TQM/CQI  method  is\nbased  upon  including  all  levels  of  employees  into  the  process  of\nidentifying  areas  for  improvement and soliciting  their  involvement\nin  developing  the  mechanisms  by  which  this  may  be  accomplished.\nThere  are  several  principles  that  may  be  applied  in  order  to\nempower  employees:\n1)  Treat  all  employee  with  dignity  and  respect.\n2)  Provide employees with  important work to  do on\ncritical  issues.\n3)  Give  employees  discretion  and  autonomy  over\ntheir  tasks  and  resources.\n4)  Allow  employees  to  find  ways  to  better  serve\ntheir  customers.\n5)  Encourage employees  to  find  and fix  problems.\n6)  Enable  employees  to  put  their  ideas  into\naction.\n\n7)  Assist employees in building relationships and\nsupports.\ne.  Systematic  Evaluation  of Processes.  The TQM/CQI\nmodel  incorporates the concept that the potential of eliminating\nmistakes and errors  lies not in changing worker  behavior but in\nimproving the system through which work is done. Emphasis is placed\nupon evaluating and analyzing the workplace systems so as to change\nthem in order to facilitate a process that will result in improved\nquality when the final product is delivered.  Therefore,  TQM/CQI\nmethods  center  about a scientific  or systematic  approach to\nstudying and evaluating processes.  Decisions for change are based\non data analysis rather than hunches, root causes to hindrances are\nsought rather than reacting to superficial symptoms and permanent\nsolutions are sought rather than relying on quick fixes.  Thus, the\nTQM/CQI approach involves the use of a number of scientific tools\nand data collection mechanisms in order to analyze system processes\nand  evaluate  the improvement  generated  when  changes are\nimplemented.  Some of the data gathering and analytical  systems\nused in the TQM/CQI method  include:\n1)  Flowcharts - simple to construct  charts  that\nemphasize the major steps to a process.\n2)  Work  Flow  Diagrams  - Show the movement of\nmaterials, people or information within a system.\n3)  Pareto  Charts - Focus  improvement  efforts by\nranking problems or their causes.  It is a chart depicting a series\nof  bars  whose  heights  reflects  the frequency  or impact  of the\nproblem.\n4)  cause and Effect Diagrams - pictorial displays\nof a list.  They  identify and organize the possible  causes of\nproblems.\n5)  Operational Definitions - Precise definitions\nof important terms and procedures used in a project.  They simply\ndescribe what something is and how it is used.\n6)  Histograms  or Frequency  Distributions -\nPinpoint problems by identifying where and when problems do and do\nnot occur.\n7)  Time Plots - Are used to examine data for\ntrends and patterns that occur over time.\n8)  Dot Plots - Show  what  values  occur and how\noften.  They are used to quickly examine the distribution or spread\nof data.\n\n9)  Checfcsheets - structured forms that facilitate\nthe recording and analyzing of data.\n10)  Scatter  Diagrams  - Display  the  relationship\nbetween two variables.  The shape of the scatter indicates if and\nhow the two factors are related.\nf.  Monitoring  the  Results  of  Improvement  Strategies.\nMost  TQM/CQI  models  consist  of  studying  data  to  identify  system\nproblems and suggesting solutions that are believed to correct the\nsystem  problems.  Results  (outcomes)  are  then  evaluated  and\nmeasured to assess if improvement has occurred.  If improvement  is\nrealized,  steps are taken to  incorporate  the changes  permanently\nand retain the enhancements.  If positive results are not achieved,\nthe process is repeated and an alternative enhancement strategy is\ndeveloped.  To  accomplish  this  objective  it  is  imperative  that\nperformance  indicators are:\n1)  The best indicators of  performance\n2)  Outcomes that the identified customers  desire\nand expect  (customer  oriented).\n3)  Operationally  defined  (clearly  understood  by\nall).\n4)  Easily  identified\n5)  Measurable\ng.  Project Selection.  Most successful TQM/CQI efforts\nare project based.  The processes or subsystems that are best\nsuited for TQM/CQI treatment are those that are utilized by a broad\nnumber  of  users  throughout  the  service  delivery  system.  The\nfollowing are guidelines that are to be considered when considering\nTQM/CQI projects:\n1)  The project is considered to have a significant\nimpact  on  improving  the  quality  of  life  for  clients  and/or  the\nquality of work for employees.\n2)  The project allows for the collection of data\nthat can be easily measured  in observable terms.\n3)  Results can be obtained  in 4 to 6 months.\n4)  The process is not one that is currently under\nrevision  or  scheduled  to  be  substantially  changed  in  the  near\nfuture.\n\n5)  The process has clearly  defined  starting  and\nending points.\n6)  The project represents a process /subsystem that\nneeds  improvement.  The  redesign  of  an  entire  service  delivery\nsystem  is not  likely  to be benefitted  by the  use of the  TQM/CQZ\nmethod.\n\nI.  NVTC  INITIATIVE\nCurrent Status The NVTC Community Integration Initiative is the NVTC downsizing project with the\nprimary objective of reducing the resident census from 270 to 200 persons during a\nthree-year period as determined in 1991 under Governor Wilder's administration.\nTimelines\nJanuary 1992 A  special  allocation  was  requested  and  appropriated  from  the  1992  General\nAssembly in order to support funding for community placements of individuals to\nreduce to a census of 200 over a three-year period (July 1993 to June 1996).\nFebruary 1992 From July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993, a total of $180,000 in start-up funds was\nmade  available  to  community  planners  for  leasing  of  homes  and  purchasing\nfurnishings, equipment, etc.  A total of $2,100,000 was also appropriated over a\nthree-year period beginning July 1, 1993.  This funding was to be utilized as Home\nand Community-based Medicaid Waiver match for all services that were appropriate\nfor the individuals re-entering the community from NVTC.\nApril 1992 The  State  established  a three-year  budget,  matching  State General  Funds  with\nMedicaid Waiver  funds to cover  the re-entry to  the community.  The schedule\ninvolved three years, allocating funds for community placement of 30 persons for the\nfirst year (1993-1994), 20 for the second year (1994-1995)  and 20 for the third year\n(1995-1996).  Later this schedule was revised as individual needs and high costs of\nresidential services required.\nSeptember 1992 A steering committee for the Initiative was formed. Membership consists of staff from\nthe  Northern Virginia Community  Services Boards (CSBs), parents of  individuals\nliving at the Training Center, Virginia Office of Mental Retardation Services (OMRS)\nstaff,  the  Northern Virginia  ARC, Parents and Advocates of the  Institutionalized\nRetarded (PAIR), private providers and staff of NVTC.  The steering committee has\nmet quarterly throughout the project.\n1\n\nMarch-September  1993 The NVTC Steering Committee required that detailed information about the quality\nand scope of community residential providers be sent to all families interested in the\ncommunity  re-entry.  Also, families developed a set of questions to be asked of\nprospective program providers to assist them in making informed choices.\nMarch 1993 Families, NVTC staff, private providers, and CSB staff began meeting to plan for the\nfirst round of placements of individuals interested in community re-entry (Continued\nthroughout 1993).\nApril  1993 The first individual moved out of NVTC to a community placement via the Medicaid\nWaiver.\nDecember 1993 A total of 10 individuals moved into community homes in calendar year 1993.\nDecember 1994 Twenty-eight  additional  placements  were  finalized  at  the  rate  of  two-to-three\nplacements per month during this calendar year.  All  placements were  in  small\ncommunity residences with intensive involvement of parents/families in choice and\nselection of providers.\nJune 1995 The total number  of discharges has been 41 for the first two fiscal  years of the\nInitiative.  These 41 placements have depleted the first two years of funding of the\nspecial allocation.\nJuly 1995 The remainder of the original funding from the special allocation funds for the third\nyear of the Initiative will become available. These funds will serve approximately 12\nadditional persons.\nA supplemental funding request of $600,000 to assist in placing the remaining 17\npersons was included in the FY96 NVTC Continuous Improvement Plan submitted\nto and approved in the 1995 General Assembly Session.\n\n...\nII.

PROCESS\nCollaborative Planning The DMHMRSAS, five Northern Virginia Community Services Boards (CSB's), the\nEmphasized NVTC Senior Staff, and representatives from the parent and advocates group of NVTC\nresidents, spent 18 months planning ihe move into community residential settings\n(January 1992-September 1993).\nParent Involvement Most NVTC parents had never considered the possibility that their sons and daughters\nEmphasized with severe/profound mental retardation would ever live in the community.  Many\nof the potential residents of NVTC for the Community Initiative had/have multiple\ndisabilities  with  significant  physical  and behavioral  problems.  Frequent  parent\nmeetings  established  assurances  that  the  community  environment  would  be\nsufficiently  supportive  and  help  consumers  attempt  to  attain  personal  goals\n(February/December  1993).\nFamily choice was Many parents were empowered for the first time with choices for community resi-\nEmphasized dential options for their sons and daughters.  Parents helped select providers and\nroommates configuration for the developing community homes (Beginning Summer\n1993).\n\ni\nIndividualized placements Based on information regarding the consumer's friendship choices, needs, interest,\nwere designed etc.,  community  placements  were  highly  individualized.  The  staff  at  NVTC\ndeveloped and sent a questionnaire to all family members, advocates or guardians\nof every person residing at NVTC. This questionnaire consisted of basic information\ndescribing the project and solicited feedback on community placement and choice\nof living options of the families for those individuals at the Center.  Such questions\nas type of living arrangement (i.e., group home, foster home, supported living, etc.)\ndesired  by  the  families,  as well  as roommate  selection  and  time  frames  were\nsurveyed.  About  50%  of  the  questionnaires  were  completed  and  returned\n(Summer/Fall 93).\nPersons Prioritized NVTC did not simply prioritize the \"least disabled persons\" for placements. Instead,\nfor Placements with the involvement of families, a roster of individuals who were interested or\nvolunteered for community placement was developed.

OUTCOMES\nBy July 1, 1996 The census of NVTC will be reduced to 200 persons on schedule.\n•  Strong collaborative relationships have been developed between NVTC\nand  Community  providers.  These  relationships  will  greatly  assist\nNVTC in further downsizing efforts.\n•  NVTC parents and families now understand that persons with severe\ndisabilities can live in community options, due to the success of this\nInitiative.\n\nI.

''\n§1997 et sec., the Civil Rights Division of the United States\nDepartment of Justice was commencing an investigation into\nconditions at Northern Virginia Training Center (\"NVTC\") , a\nfacility for the mentally retarded located in Fairfax, Virginia.\nAs specified by the statute, we are now writing to inform you\nthat our review indicates that unconstitutional conditions exist\nat NVTC, and also to advise you of the minimum measures we\nbelieve are necessary in order to remedy those conditions.\nOur investigation consisted, first, of several comprehensive\ntours of NVTC by independent experts, most recently on\nOctober 22-24, 1990.  The experts observed conditions in all the\nresidential units of NVTC at various times of the day,\ninterviewed administrators, staff and residents, and examined\na variety of records.  Further, we gathered and analyzed\ndocumentation relating to the operation of NVTC, including:  a\nvariety of policies and procedures; information relating to\nstaffing; minutes from various committees, including the Behavior\nManagement Committee and the Senior Staff Committee; incident and\ninvestigation reports; injury reports; restraint logs; lists of\nresidents on medications; and residents' records.\nBased upon our investigation, we find that conditions exist\nat NVTC that deprive residents of their constitutional rights.\nThe United States Supreme Court has clearly stated that\ninstitutionalized mentally retarded persons have a constitutional\nright to adequate medical care, reasonable safety, and such\ntraining as an appropriate professional would consider reasonable\nto ensure their safety and freedom from undue bodily restraints.\n\n- 2 -\nYouncberq v. Poaeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324  (1982)..  We have concluded\nthat the State subjects its residents of NVTC to conditions that\nviolate their constitutional rights, including conditions that\nseriously threaten the health and safety of NVTC residents.\nThese conditions include:\n1.  Failure to provide sufficient training to\nresidents to avoid undue risks to residents'\npersonal safety and unreasonable use of physical\nand chemical restraints;\n2.  Failure to provide sufficient numbers of\nappropriately trained staff to render and\nimplement professional judgments regarding\nnecessary care, training, and medical treatment\nand to avoid undue risks to residents' personal\nsafety and unreasonable use of physical and\nchemical restraints;\n3.  Failure to provide adequate medical care;\n4.  Failure to adequately monitor medications;\n5.  Failure to keep and maintain such records as will\nallow staff to render professional judgments\nregarding care and treatment of residents.\nSet forth below are our findings and recommendations.\nI. Inadequate Behavioral Training\nA.  Failure to provide and implement training programs\nNVTC fails to provide professionally designed and\nimplemented training programs sufficient to ensure that residents\nare not subjected to unreasonable risks to their personal safety\nand undue bodily restraint.  Our expert psychologist found that\nthe psychologists on duty have excessive caseloads and\nprofessional\"responsibilities  so that they do not have adequate\ntime to render professional judgments with respect to matters\nwithin their professional responsibilities, including the design\nand implementation of training programs and supervision and\ntraining of direct care workers.  As a result of the shortage of\npsychologists, treatment programs are not individualized and\noften contain inappropriate or incompatible goals.  They often\nremain the same, including the use of restraint, from year to\nyear.  Our expert psychologist concluded that the current\npractice of behavior modification at NVTC fails to reduce self-\nabusive, aggressive,, and other maladaptive and inappropriate\nbehaviors.\n\n- 3 -\nDue to the lack of training, direct care workers lack skills\nnecessary to implement and monitor behavior training programs.\nAs a result, often data is not collected or the data collected by\nsuch untrained and unsupervised workers is unreliable.  The\nindividual training programs reviewed reflect this inconsistent\nand inaccurate data collection, implementation and monitoring.\nDirect care staff did not know the elements of the residents'\ntraining programs or know how to carry them out.  The failure to\ndevelop consistent and necessary training programs, to implement\nand monitor them, and to collect and record accurate and\npertinent progress data places residents at substantial risk of\nharm to their personal safety and to excessive mechanical and\nchemical restraint.\nThe training programs were seriously deficient in their\nfailure to address residents' needs and to consider alternatives\nto restraint, especially in cases where restraint had not been\neffective in reducing maladaptive and inappropriate behaviors,\nresulting in residents failing to receive such training as is\nreasonably necessary to protect them from unreasonable risks of\nharm.  Training programs are further compromised at NVTC by a >\nlack of coordination between professional staff.  Medical\nprocedures interfere unduly with residents' programs:  routine\nblood work and the evaluation of even trivial problems often\ncause residents to be kept out of their programs for half of the\nday or even the entire day.  This evidences a lack of\ncoordination between residents' programmatic and medical needs.\nThere is no justification for preventing residents from\nparticipating in their training programs for medical procedures\nand evaluations that take minutes.\nB.  Excessive use of restraint\nWe were struck by the pervasive use of restraint at this\nfacility.  Staff regularly resort to chemical and physical\nrestraints to control residents' behavior in violation of the\nresidents' constitutional rights.  A myriad of mechanical\nrestraint devices were in evidence and in use during the tours,\nincluding leather wrist and ankle straps, helmets with face\nguards, and papoose boards.  Moreover,' it is not uncommon for\nthese restraints to be used in combination with seclusion and\nwith chemical restraint  (emergency injections of psychotropic\nmedication).\nAlthough we were told restraints are generally used in\nconnection with behavior programs, these programs do not\nfacilitate a reduction in the uss of such restraints and\nresidents remain on programs with restraint as their central\ncomponents for long periods of tine.  Indeed, for some residents\nthe incidence of restraint and the length of time spent in\nrestraints is increasing.  The behavior programs are not modified\nto address the ineffectiveness of restraints, nor do they direct\n\n- 4 -\nthose inple-6r.t.ing the programs to attempt other measures prior\nto resort to restraint.  On the contrary, restraint is used so\nfrequently that it appears to be the treatment of choice rather\nthan a technique of last resort.\nWhen physical restraints are employed, they are not\nconsistently monitored and evaluated by qualified professional\nstaff.  Thus, significant numbers of injuries occur during the\nimplementation of restraints.  Moreover, restraint is used for\ninappropriate reasons and in response to behaviors that are not\ndangerous.  Many residents are restrained in their beds at night,\nraising serious concerns for the safety of residents in the event\nof a fire.\nIn sum, NVTC lacks adequate and necessary training programs.\nOur consultant concluded that these activities expose residents\nto undue risks to their personal safety and to undue restraint.\nII. Insufficient Trained Direct Care Staff\nThe safety of NVTC residents is threatened by the inadequate\ntraining of direct care staff for the myriad tasks assigned to\nthem.  There is a widespread failure to appropriately manage\nmaladaptive resident behavior.  Staff questioned about a specific\nresident's behavioral programs were unaware of the components.\nDuring our tours, we rarely observed competent staff\nintervention.  Our experts observed an almost total absence of\nstaff-resident interaction in daily programs.  Some residents in\nneed of assistance were unnoticed by staff for extended periods\nof time until our experts pointed them out.  Residents were not\nencouraged, praised, or otherwise reinforced for their efforts,\nnor were they given directions which would keep them on task.\nOur experts concluded that direct care staff do not possess the\ntechnical competence to adequately supervise and train residents\nof NVTC.  Moreover, NVTC has insufficient staff to implement\nappropriate programs, to provide appropriate encouragement and\ndirection, and to interact with residents in meaningful ways and\nto further residents' training goals. .<\nDirect care staff training at NVTC is deficient and\ncontributes to inadequate care by staff.  Our experts' review\nindicated that the training given to the staff is insufficient in\ndepth and scope to enable them to adequately provide essential\ncare to residents.  The direct care staff receives insufficient\ntraining concerning how to effectively intervene to prevent or\ndeal with acting out behaviors of residents or to implement\nresidents' individualized training programs.  Direct care staff\nis not trained in the detection and identification of possible\nside effects of any medications, but is directed to notify\nnursing staff of \"any change\" in residents.  The absence of\ntraining regarding what changes in residents may be significant\n\n- 5 -\nor, indeed, what constitutes a \"change,\" renders staff wholly\ninadequate tc protect the health and safety of residents who are\nreceiving psychotropic, anticonvulsant, or other medications and\ncombinations of medications with serious potential side effects.\nAs a consequence of the foregoing staffing inadequacies,\nresidents of NVTC are exposed to serious risks to their health\nand safety.\nIII. Inadequate Medical Care\nOur consultant found that prinary care physicians do not\nprovide prinary medical care; instead, various outside\nconsultants provide care to residents of NVTC.  As a result,\nmedical care is fragmented and uncoordinated, with little prinary\nfocus.  Serious medical conditions and marked functional\ndeterioration are not comprehensively evaluated or effectively\ntreated.  Thus, there were inadequate efforts to diagnose\nresidents' medical problems, a process essential to then\nselecting the appropriate drug, if necessary, and evaluating the\nefficacy of treatment.  As a result, residents' physical  \"  «•\nconditions often deteriorated and they were placed at risk.  In\naddition, there is little long range therapeutic planning for\nchronic medical problems and a failure to provide adequate\npreventative health care.  Instead staff merely monitors medical\nconditions as they worsen, rather than taking preventative\nmeasures to protect residents from such deterioration.  This\nfailure to adequately monitor and care for serious medical\nconditions and to prevent deterioration includes the failure to\nadequately address residents' feeding and positioning needs.\nTherefore, we have concluded that the care and treatment of such\nresidents is inconsistent with the exercise of judgment by a\nqualified professional.\nAs a further result of the reliance on outside consultants\nat NVTC, the primary care physicians have not acquired expertise\nin the complex yet common medical problems found in populations\nof people with severe developmental disabilities.  Thus, for\nexample, neurological care at NVTC depends upon the services of a\nneurolocist who does annual evaluations only.  This seriously\ncompromises the medical care of people who live at NVTC.\nIV.  Inadequate Medication Practices\nMedications at NVTC are not adequately monitored.  Residents\nare placed on combinations of drugs, psychotropics, anti-\nconvulsants, and others, which have risks of dangerous side\neffects, with no adequate review by the pharmacist or other\nprofessional to note these combinations and to recommend changes,\nwhere appropriate.  Moreover, as noted above, there is inadequate\nmonitoring of residents for drug induced side effects, including\ntardive dyskinesia.  Lack of training for direct care staff, who\n\n- 6 -\nspend the most time with residents, and confusion among staff as\nto who is responsible for monitoring, coupled with inadecuate\nreview of prescriptions, place the residents of NVTC at severe\nrisk-\nThere is insufficient effort made to properly diagnose\nresidents prior to prescribing dedications for psychiatric\ndisorders and not all residents in need of psychiatric evaluation\nreceive such evaluations.  Careful selection of medication, if\nnecessary, and its trial in conjunction with a behavioral program\ndepend upon adequate evaluation and an initial diagnosis.\nOverall psychotropic medication usage has declined in the last\ntwo years.  Yet the positive and negative effects of psychotropic\nmedications, once prescribed, are not adequately monitored at\nNVTC.  Our consultants found that residents who had benefited\nfrom psychotropic medication's in appropriate doses nevertheless\nhad their medications discontinued.  As a result of such\ninadequate medication practices, residents' conditions\ndeteriorate, abilities to function decrease, and maladaptive ar.d\ninappropriate behaviors increase.  Residents then are unable to\nparticipate in training activities and are subjected to increased\nphysical and chemical restraint.\nMedications administered at NVTC include chemical restraint\nof residents, using psychotropic medications on an emergency\nbasis.  There are serious problems with this practice beyond the\nfailure to provide training programs that might reduce or\neliminate the need to resort to chemical restraint in the first\ninstance.  Emergency injections of psychotropic medication are\nused repeatedly with some residents, without limitation on the\ntotal number of doses or assurance that repetitive use will\ntrigger review and revision, if necessary, of the resident's\nbehavior program.  The consulting psychiatrist at NVTC neither\nreviews the use of emergency chemical restraint nor participates\nin the decision to use it, even with residents who receive a\nsubstantial number of emergency doses of psychotropic medication.\nWith one part-time consulting psychiatrist for over 270\nresidents, it does not appear that the psychiatrist would have\ntime to conduct such reviews.\n  ;\nFor the reasons enumerated here, medication practices at\nNVTC are inadequate, expose residents to serious risks to their\nhealth and safety, and impair their abilities to function.\nV.  Inadequate Recorckseoina\nRecordkeeping at NVTC is deficient.  Behavioral records of\nresidents are not maintained and progress data are not collected\nin a consistent fashion.  The consequence of the failure to\nmaintain adequate records is that responsible staff are unable to\nrender professional judgments regarding care, treatment, and\ntraining of residents of NVTC, thereby subjecting them to\n\n- 7 -\nunnecessary risks of ham.  NVTC has not established\nrecordkeepir.g systems and procedures to ensure reliability and\nvalidity of information relevant to the care and training of\nresidents.  Methods for collecting baseline data, follow-up, and\nprogress data are absent or inadequate.\ni\nInaccurate or incomplete behavioral data collection and\nrecordkeepir.g present an active danger to residents by depriving\nprofessional and other staff of information necessary to make\nappropriate and safe decisions regarding training of residents.\nTreatment decisions are implicated as well because, in the\nabsence of accurate behavioral data, management of patients on\npsychotropic medications cannot take place consistent with\nprofessional standards of practice.\nOur consultants also found medical records to be cumbersome,\nfragmented, totally inadequate, and even dangerous in their\ndeficiencies.  Results of most diagnostic testing and routine\nlaboratory data often were not found in the charts and\nconsultations regarding major medical problems were not readily\navailable.  Other documents, while in the records, are not  ,.\nconsistently found in their designated sections.  A comprehensive\nunderstanding of diagnostic and therapeutic measures for any\nproblem is, therefore, a difficult process.  Fragmented medical\nrecords, coupled with the lack of coordinated medical care and\ninadequate communication among professionals at NVTC severely\ncompromise adequate medical care.\nMinimally Necessary Remedies\nAs discussed above, NVTC residents are being subjected to\negregious or flagrant conditions that deprive them of their\nconstitutional rights pursuant to a pattern or practice of\nresistance to the full enjoyment of these rights.  To rectify the\ndeficiencies at NVTC and to ensure that constitutionally adequate\nconditions are maintained thereafter, we propose to enter into an\nagreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia which shall be\nentered as an order of a Federal Court and which shall provide,\nat a minimum, that NVTC shall implement the following remedies:\n1)  The Commonwealth must provide professionally designed\ntraining programs to the residents at NVTC who need them and for\nwhom training will reduce or eliminate unreasonable risks to\ntheir personal safety and/or the need to use undue bodily and\nchemical restraints, and must ensure that such programs are\nappropriately implemented by trained staff.  Immediate attention\nmust be given to residents who have been subject to repeated\nepisodes of mechanical or chemical restraint for extended periods\nof time by identifying them and providing necessary training.\nIn addition, the Commonwealth must discontinue the use of papoose\nboards and the use of restraints in conjunction with seclusion at\nNVTC.\n\n- 8 -\n2)  The Commonwealth nust hire, deploy, and provide  ongoing\ntraining to a sufficient nuaber of competent and qualified  direct\ncare and professional  staff at NVTC to*provide its residents  with\nadequate care, treatment, and training programs to protect  them\nfrom unreasonable risks of bodily  harm and to their personal\nsafety.\n3)  The Commonwealth must provide coordinated medical  care\nto NVTC residents, through the use of NVTC's primary  care\nphysicians and outside consultants, that adequately  addresses\ntheir chronic and long-term medical  needs and ensures that\nappropriate assessments, medical  care plans, and  consultations\nwith specialists are provided to those residents who need  them.\n4)  The Commonwealth must assure that medications  are\nappropriately monitored, that the effects of medications  are\ndocumented  in residents' records, and that decisions to\nprescribe, change, or discontinue the use of medications  are\nbased upon sufficient data and are the result of qualified\nprofessional judgment.  *\n5)  The Commonwealth must assure that NVTC develops  and\nimplements adequate recordkeeping  systems to monitor the use and\neffectiveness of behavior and other programs and medical\nrecordkeeping  systems sufficient to allow  identification,\nmonitoring, and follow-up of medical conditions as appropriate.\nInformation about Federal  financial assistance which may  be\navailable to assist with the remedial process can be  obtained\nthrough the United States Department of Health and Human\nServices' Regional Office  (Director, Intergovernmental  and\nCongressional Affairs),  and through the United States  Department\nof Education.\nAlthough the primary purpose of this letter, consistent  with\nCRIPA, is to describe the unconstitutional  conditions at NVTC\nthat require remediation, we also wish to acknowledge some of the\npositive steps taken at NVTC.  During-our time on-site at NVTC,\nwe encountered many staff who appeared  committed to providing\nresidents with appropriate care  in a safe environment.  Our\nexperts noted that the physical plant at NVTC and its  recreation\nfacilities may offer opportunities  for residents to enhance  their\nlives through varied  activities  in different settings.  They  also\nnoted the opportunities given to a number of residents to work\nand move about in the  community.\nLess positive, however, have been the circumstances\nsurrounding our investigation which has been somewhat marred  by\nwhat may be termed the disruptive  and litigious actions of\nVirginia's attorneys.  These actions have impaired our ability  to\nconduct this investigation  in the spirit of cooperation  intended\n\n- 9 -\nby the Civil Rights of Institutionalized  Persons Act, but va hope\nthat, cooperatively, our future efforts with Cosuaonwealth\nofficials and attorneys will lead to an amicable resolution of\nthis matter.\nOur attorneys will be contacting the Virginia Attorney\nGeneral's Office shortly to arrange a meeting to discuss this\nmatter in greater detail.  In the meantime, should you or your\nstaff have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free\nto call Arthur E. Peabody, Jr., Chief, Special Litigation\nSection, at (202) 514-6255.\nSincerely,\nc\n,. .../<*-\nJohn R.
