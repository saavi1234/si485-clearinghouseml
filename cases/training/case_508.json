    "summary": "<p>On October 21, 1996, four advocacy groups, the People First of Washington, the Arc of Washington State, the Autism Society of Washington, and the Washington Protection and Advocacy System (WPAS), and several individuals filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, challenging the dangerous conditions at Rainier School, Washington's largest state-operated residential habilitation center for people with intellectual disabilities.  Plaintiffs alleged violations of their constitutional rights and rights guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Social Security Act.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class action certification.</p><p>Plaintiffs' Complaint detailed numerous deficiencies and incidents of abuse, neglect and injury which occurred at the Rainier School.  The Complaint alleged inadequate basic care, substandard medical care, excessive injury and abuse,  inadequate habilitation and training,  inadequate behavior management, and lax discharge planning and community placement at the Rainier School.  Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to correct the conditions and to allow residents to be transferred to integrated community settings.</p><p>On March 21, 1997, the District Court (Judge Franklin D. Burgess) granted defendants' motion to strike the complaint.  Plaintiffs were granted leave and directed to file an amended complaint, which was filed on April 8, 1997.</p><p>Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was denied on May 1, 1997.  The District Court allowed the group Friends of Rainier, Inc. to intervene as a intervenor/defendant.</p><p>On January 27, 1998, the parties filed a joint motion to stay the proceedings and for adoption of the Settlement Agreement.  The District Court granted the motion on February 5, 1998 and stayed the case.  A hyper-link to the Settlement Agreement was not available on the PACER docket and it terms are not known.</p><p>The Court entered a Stipulation and Order on December 6, 1999, granting the parties joint motion to voluntarily dismiss the case with prejudice.  Plaintiffs were awarded attorneys fees and costs in the amount of $75,000.00.</p><p></p>",

This is a civil rights class action brought by six Washington citizens with developmental\n24 disabilities who currently reside at the Rainier Residential Habilitation Center in Buckley, Washington,\n25 on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated; and People First of Washington, Inc.; The Arc\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 2 Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nof Washington State, Inc.; the Autism Society of Washington; and the Washington Protection and\n2  Advocacy System, Inc., in its capacity as the designated protection and advocacy agency for those\nWashington citizens who have mental and physical disabilities.\n1.2.  The representative plaintiffs and the other members of the plaintiff class that they represent\n(hereinafter \"Class Plaintiffs\") are residents of the Rainier Residential Habilitation Center (hereinafter\n\"Rainier\"),  a  large  state  institution  for  individuals  with  mental  retardation  and  developmental\ndisabilities.  Specifically, plaintiffs bring this action to redress the unconstitutional, unlawful, unsafe,\n8  and  unprofessional  conditions  imposed  on  them  by  the  defendants  under  color  of  state  law.\nApproximately  four hundred fifty persons with mental retardation and developmental  disabilities\n10  currently reside at Rainier.\n11  1.3.  Rainier is a dangerous place to live. Many members of the plaintiff class have been and\n12  continue to be subjected to abuse, neglect, injury, and unnecessary physical and chemical restraint.  In\n13  addition, Rainier and the defendant state officials responsible for the conditions at Rainier routinely\n14  deprive the plaintiff class of liberty and fundamental human rights in violation of their rights under the\n15  Constitution and laws of the United States.\n16  1.4.  By this action, the plaintiffs seek to enforce the constitutional and statutory rights of those\n17  individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities currently residing at Rainier to\n18  receive their  habilitation, vocational, and other services and supports in integrated settings and in\n19  accordance with current professional standards.\n20  1.5.  The plaintiff  class' need for habilitation, vocational training, and other supports and\n21  services require placement in small, community-based programs where their individual developmental\n22  and daily living needs can be met.  However, the defendants deny the plaintiffs these services because\n23  of the plaintiffs' perceived severe disabilities, complex medical conditions, and challenging behaviors.\n24  1.6.  The defendants' attitudes on the severity and complexity of the individual class members'\n25 I disabilities,  medical  conditions,  and behaviors  are based, in large part,  on plaintiffs'  prolonged\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n2'  Civil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28 II  _ 3  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n page\n\n1 institutionalization at Rainier, as well as the defendants' failure to meet their federal statutory and\n2 regulatory obligations to place, monitor, and discharge the members of the plaintiff class to alternative\n3 non-institutional programs.\n4 1.7.  The defendants have failed to properly assess the plaintiff class' skills and abilities, in\n5 contravention of the requirements of the federal laws and regulations governing the provision of\n6 habilitation and active treatment to individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities.\n7 1.8.  The acts and omissions of the defendants have violated the rights of the plaintiff class under\n8 the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Title II of the Americans with\n9 Disabilities  Act  of  1990, 42 U.S.C.  §  12131, st  sea,, (hereinafter  \"ADA\");  Section  504  of  the\n10 Rehabilitation Act of 1973,29 U.S.C. § 794, ej ggg. (hereinafter \"Section 504\"); and the Social Security\n11 Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, elssa. (hereinafter \"SSA\").\n12\nJurisdiction and Venue\n13\n2.1.  This action arises under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to redress the deprivation,\n14\nunder color of state law, of the plaintiffs' rights, privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution\n15\nand laws of the United States. The rights which plaintiffs seek to redress are guaranteed by the First and\n16\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as 29 U.S.C. §§ 720 and 794, 42\n17\nU.S.C. §§ 1396, 1396a, 1396d, and 12131.\n18\n2.2.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 133 l(a), 1343(3) & (4), and 1367 as\n19\nthis action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and seeks injunctive and other\n20\nequitable relief under acts of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights.\n21\n2.3.  This Court also has authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 & 2202 to enter declaratory\n22\njudgments declaring the rights and other legal relations of parties to the action, as well as 42 U.S.C. §\n23\n1983.\n24\n2.4.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as all of the parties reside in the State of\n25\nWashington and plaintiffs' claims for relief arise within this state.\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 4 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n1 Parties\n2 A. Plaintiffs\n3 3.1.  The plaintiff People First of Washington, Inc. (hereinafter \"People First\"), a nonprofit\n4 corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Washington, is a state wide self-advocacy\n5 organization governed entirely by people with developmental disabilities. More than one thousand\n6 Washington citizens are members of People First through its thirty-three chapters and support groups\n7 located throughout Washington.  People First maintains its main administrative office at 932V4 Sixth\n8 Street in Clarkston, Washington.\n9 3.2.  People First's members include individuals with disabilities who currently live in state\n10 institutions, residential facilities, and nursing homes, including Rainier.  People First believes that all\n11 of its individual members could live in their local communities if appropriate habilitation programs and\n12 other support services were available to them.\n13 3.3.  People First's purpose, for which it expends its resources, are as follows:\n14 a.  To promote the philosophy liiat everyone, no matter what disability he or she has or\nits severity, has the same basic civil rights and responsibilities;\n15\nb.  To  advocate  and defend  the rights of persons with disabilities  in the areas of\n16 employment, education, housing and transportation; and\n17 c.  To provide a way for persons with disabilities to express and remedy their concerns\nand enhance their well-being.\n18\n3.4.  To advance these goals, People First and its members advocate for legislation to enable\n19\nthose Washington citizens with disabilities to live more independently.  Its members travel around the\n20\nstate teaching people with disabilities about self-advocacy and their legal rights and responsibilities at\n21\nregularly scheduled local, regional, and statewide conferences, meetings, and programs.  People First\n22\nprovides leadership and self-advocacy training, and fosters community awareness through the volunteer\n23\nservice activities of its members.  Its individual members also represent the interests of Washington's\n24\ncitizens with disabilities by serving on regional, state, and national committees, including, but not\n25\nlimited to: the Managed Care Feasibility Work Group, the Developmental Disabilities Council for the\n26\n27 Class Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 5 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nState of Washington, and the Statewide Advisory Committee for Developmental Disabilities.\n3.5.  People First International was founded in 1974 by residents of the Fairview Training\nCenter, a state institution for persons with mental retardation in Oregon.  In discussing the selection of\na name for their new organization, one of the founding members said, \"Why not call ourselves People\nFirst, because we want to be known as people first before we're known for our handicaps?\" After that,\nthey formed People First organizations in many other states, including Washington. These organizations\nshare a common purpose — to support their members' right to speak for themselves, make their own\ndecisions, and know how to exercise their rights as citizens, including their right to live in their home\ncommunities.\n10 3.6.  People First has many individual members who reside at the Rainier.  These individual\n11 members, who actively support the goals and purposes of People First, are individuals who are directly\n12 harmed  by the actions and inactions of the defendants,  as set forth  and more fully  described  in\n13 paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 below.\n14 3.7.  Plaintiff James Campbell (hereinafter \"Campbell\"), who was born on June 2,1972, was\n15 first diagnosed as having mental retardation when he was a child.  Since December 1,1983, when he\n16 was just eleven years old — and for the last thirteen years — Mr. Campbell has continuously resided and\n17 has been unnecessarily institutionalized at Rainier.\n18 3.8.  Dennis Campbell, who is a resident of Vancouver, Washington, brings this action on behalf\n19 of James Campbell in his capacity as James Campbell's next friend.  Dennis Campbell, who is a member\n20 of People First, is familiar with James Campbell.\n21 3.9.  James Campbell resides at PAT E / Shasta House, a residential unit at Rainier for men and\n22 women with developmental disabilities.\n23 3.10.  James Campbell is a capable man with good communication skills who has been labeled\n24 as moderately retarded. He has repeatedly stated that he wants to leave Rainier and live in a normal\n25  home  in the community.  However, because of the defendants'  disparate discharge policies  and\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 6 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\ndiscriminatory development of community-based services, the defendants have denied James Campbell\nthe individualized habilitation programs and services he needs.\n3.11.  James Campbell has little opportunity to model appropriate social skills or to learn how\nto  act  in  the  community.  Instead,  he  is regularly  exposed  to  persons  whose  social  skills  and\ninappropriate behaviors are at least as problematic as his own.\n3.12.  James Campbell is not receiving adequate habilitation at Rainier.  James Campbell and the\nindividuals in his residential unit have little or no choice about when to wake up and go to bed, what to\neat, or what to do from day to day. On average, plaintiff James Campbell receives less than two hours\nof programming per day, which is neither adequate nor appropriate for his needs.  James Campbell's\n10 limited habilitation program does not constitute active treatment according to accepted professional\n11 standards.\n12 3.13.  James Campbell lacks meaningful  employment training opportunities at Rainier.  He\n13 participates in an inadequate and segregated workshop at Rainier, where much of his \"vocational\n14 training\" amounts to repetitive and monotonous tasks, interrupted by extended periods of \"dead time\"\n15 when he has nothing to do.  This \"program\" is the only \"employment\" opportunity available to James\n16 Campbell and the vast majority of his fellow Rainier residents.\n17 3.14.  James Campbell could receive all of his habilitation, vocational, and attendant services in\n18 the community.  However,  he remains at Rainier because of barriers  caused  by the  defendants'\n19 development and operation of a community service system that discriminates against him because of\n20 his disabilities and prevents his successful discharge.  These barriers include, but are not limited to, the\n21 defendants' failure to develop adequate habilitation programs for persons living in the community; their\n22 failure to develop appropriate supported employment and other day services for persons living in the\n23 community; their failure to develop adequate residential and behavioral support services for persons\n24 living in the community; and their failure to provide adequate staff development training and technical\n25 assistance available to those people who work in this state's community service system.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28  p g . 7  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\na e\n\n3.15.  Since James Campbell's admission to Rainier, no one has developed or implemented an\nappropriate discharge plan. To date, contrary to professional judgement, plaintiff James Campbell has\nnever been placed in a supervised community-based program and placement appropriate to meet his\nneeds.\n3.16.  Although  plaintiff  James  Campbell  could  live  in  the  community  with  appropriate\nhabilitation, vocational training, and support services, he experiences on a daily basis the harmful and\nunlawful  conditions described in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 herein and below.  Because of the\ndefendants' discriminatory policies and practices, he has no alternative to Rainier.\n3.17.  The failure to provide James Campbell with the necessary support services has resulted in\n10 direct and immediate injury to him, has caused him physical and emotional harm, and has been the direct\n11 cause of his deterioration and regression. This failure is unreasonable, constitutes a substantial departure\n12 from accepted professional standards, and needlessly deprives James Campbell of his liberty.\n13 3.18.  Plaintiff Chris Olson (hereinafter \"Olson\"), who was born on June 11, 1954, was first\n14 diagnosed as having mental retardation when he was a child.  Since March 2,1970, when he was just\n15 fifteen years old — and for the last twenty-six years — Mr. Olson has continuously resided and has been\n16 unnecessarily institutionalized at Rainier.\n17 3.19.  Diane Grace, who is a resident of Seattle, Washington, brings this action on behalf of Chris\n18 Olson in her capacity as Chris Olson's next friend.  Ms. Grace, who is a member of People First, is\n19 familiar with Chris Olson.\n20 3.20.  Mr. Olson resides at PAT B / Meyer House, a residential unit at Rainier for men and\n21 women with developmental disabilities and behavior problems.\n22 3.21.  Chris Olson has multiple disabilities and is labeled as severely retarded.  He does not say\n23 many words clearly and has difficulty  with the activities of daily living.  Mr. Olson engages in\n24 stereotypical, perseverative behaviors that are the result of his long institutionalization at Rainier.  With\n25 the appropriate supports, Mr. Olson could live in a normal home in the community. However, because\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 8 Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nof their discriminatory discharge policies and practices with respect to community-based habilitation\nservices and supports, the defendants have denied Mr. Olson the individualized habilitation programs\nand services he needs.\n3.22.  Mr. Olson has little opportunity to model appropriate social skills, behaviors, or to learn\nhow to act in the community.  He is exposed without respite to persons whose social skills and\ninappropriate behaviors are at least as problematic as his own.\n3.23.  Chris Olson is not receiving adequate habilitation at Rainier. Mr. Olson and the individuals\nin his residential unit have little or no choice about when to wake up and go to bed, what to eat, or what\nto do from day to day. On average, plaintiff Olson receives less than two hours of programming per day,\n10 which is neither adequate nor appropriate for his needs. Mr. Olson's limited habilitation program does\n11 not constitute active treatment according to accepted professional standards.\n12 3.24.  Mr. Olson has sustained numerous and frequently unexplained injuries while in the care\n13 of the defendants that have required medical treatment.  During 1995 and 1996, these injuries have\n14 included, but have not been limited to: lacerations to the area around his eyes, bruising about his body,\n15 abrasions, and severely torn finger and toe nails.\n16 3.25.  Despite Mr. Olson's injuries, incident reports were not done to explain how or when his\n17 injuries were sustained, as required by Rainier's policies and regulations, except in limited instances.\n18 Defendants also failed to conduct any investigation into how these injuries were sustained, in spite of\n19 Rainier policies and regulations that require such investigations when residents are injured.\n20 3.26.  Chris  Olson  lacks  meaningful  employment  training  opportunities  at  Rainier.  He\n21 participates in a limited, inadequate, and segregated workshop at Rainier, where much of his \"training\"\n22 amounts to repetitive and monotonous tasks, interrupted by extended periods of \"dead time\" when he\n23 has nothing to do.  This \"program\" is the only \"employment\" opportunity available to Mr. Olson and\n24 the vast majority of his fellow Rainier residents.\n25 3.27.  Mr. Olson could receive all of his habilitation, vocational, and individual support services\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 9 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nin the community.  He remains at Rainier because the defendants refuse to consider him for placement\nin the community because they believe he requires specialized supports — supports that they have chosen\nto provide only at Rainier.\n3.28.  The community service system operated by the defendants discriminates against Chris\nOlson and precludes his appropriate discharge from the segregation of Rainier to an  appropriate\ncommunity placement.  Plaintiff Olson could receive all of his habilitation, vocational, and attendant\nservices in the community were it not for the barriers caused by the defendants' community service\nsystem.  These barriers include, but are not limited to, the defendants'  failure to develop adequate\nhabilitation  programs for persons living in the community; their failure to develop  appropriate\n10 supported employment and other day services for persons living in the community; their failure to\n11 develop adequate residential and behavioral support services for persons living in the community; and\n12 their failure to provide adequate staff development training and technical assistance available to those\n13 people who work in this state's community service system.\n14 3.29.  Since Mr.  Olson's  admission to Rainier, no one has developed  or  implemented  an\n15  appropriate discharge plan. To date, plaintiff Olson has never been placed in a supervised community-\n16 based program and placement appropriate to his needs.\n17 3.30.  Although Chris Olson could live in the community with appropriate habilitation, vocational\n18 training, and support services, he experiences on a daily basis the harmful and unlawful  conditions\n19 described in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 herein and below.  Because of the defendants' discriminatory\n20 policies and practices, he has no alternative to Rainier.\n21 3.31.  Defendants' failure to provide Chris Olson with the necessary support services he requires\n22 has resulted in direct and immediate injury to him, caused him physical and emotional harm, and has\n23 been the direct cause of his deterioration and regression.  This failure is unreasonable, constitutes a\n24 substantial departure from accepted professional standards, and needlessly deprives Mr. Olson of his\n25 | liberty.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n^ ° Page - 10  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n3.32.  Plaintiff Houston Williams (hereinafter \"Williams\"), who was born on February 14,1949,\nwas first diagnosed as having mental retardation when he was a child.  Since February 21,1956, when\nhe was just seven years old -  and for the last forty years -  Mr. Williams has continuously resided and\nhas been unnecessarily institutionalized at Rainier.\n3.33.  Steven Cassio, who is a resident of Bonney Lake, Washington, is the duly-appointed legal\nguardian  for  Houston Williams, pursuant to an order of the  Superior  Court for  Pierce  County,\nWashington.  Steven Cassio brings this action on behalf of Houston Williams, in his capacity as his\nward's next friend and legal guardian.\n3.34.  Until recently, Houston Williams resided at PAT C/2015 Quinault Court, a residential unit\n10 at Rainier for men with severe developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors.  Last month,\n11 Rainier staff, over the objections of his legal guardian, moved Mr. Williams to PAT C / 1040 Quinault,\n12 another residential unit at Rainier.  In both of his Rainier cottages, Mr. Williams has had little\n13 opportunity to model appropriate behavior or to learn how to act in the community.  Instead, he is\n14 exposed without respite to persons whose behaviors are at least as problematic as his own.\n15 3.35.  Houston Williams has limited communication skills, but understands others when they\n16 speak to him. He can walk, feed himself, and make his choices and preferences known to others.  Mr.\n17 Williams has been labeled as severely retarded and behaviorally impaired.  While the defendants have\n18  repeatedly stated that Houston Williams is appropriate for community placement if they provide him\n19  with  extensive  supports, and have acknowledged  that his challenging behaviors are  substantially\n20  decreased when he is able to go into the community on visits, defendants have not helped Mr. Williams\n21  and his legal guardian in finding an appropriate community placement.\n22  3.36.  Mr. Williams and the other men in his residential unit have little or no choice about when\n23  to wake up and go to bed, what to eat, or what to do from day to day.  Plaintiff Williams was placed at\n24  Rainier because of his severe developmental disabilities and challenging behavior, and because the State\n25  ofWashington and the defendants' predecessors only offered services to people with his disabilities at\n26\n_  Class Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27  Civil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n^  Page - 11  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\ninstitutions like Rainier.\n3.37.  Mr. Williams hardly ever leaves Rainier, and spends most of his time in his residential unit.\nDefendants  provide  him with  minimal  activities  and  opportunities  for  socialization  outside  the\n4 I institution.\n3.38.  Defendants  have repeatedly used and continue to use a variety of inappropriate and\ndiscriminatory  restraints  to  address  Mr.  Williams'  challenging  behaviors,  including  the  use  of\nantipsychotic  medications  and  other  unspecified  manual  restraints,  despite  the  fact  that  these\ninterventions have had little effect on decreasing the frequency or severity of Mr. Williams' challenging\nbehaviors.\n10 3.39.  Although Houston Williams has the potential to acquire adaptive, functional life skills\n11 focused on the maintenance of a home, meal-preparation, and personal care skills, he cannot learn these\n12 skills at Rainier because it cannot provide him with an appropriate, community-based  habilitation\n13\nprogram.\n14 3.40.  Mr. Williams is not receiving even minimally adequate habilitation at Rainier.  He lives\n15  in a barren residence with stark, institutional furniture, a television blaring for most of the day, and little\n16 else to do. During his forty years at Rainier, Mr. Williams has not had access to meaningful activities,\n17 vocational training, or the opportunity to learn real-life skills in the natural environments where those\n18 skills can be practiced, which has resulted in a loss of his individual skills and competencies.  Mr.\n19 Williams'  current habilitation program does not constitute active treatment according to accepted\n20 professional standards.\n21 3.41.  The defendants have denied Houston Williams community placement because of his\n22 challenging behaviors.  With proper habilitation, support, and training in a small community home,\n23 however, these challenging behaviors could be decreased or eliminated.  Further, in an appropriate\n24 community-based program and placement, Mr. Williams could also receive much richer and more\n25 meaningful habilitation, consistent with his individual needs and the judgment of qualified professionals.\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage-12 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n3.42.  Since Mr. Williams' admission to Rainier, no one has developed or implemented an\nappropriate discharge plan. To date, contrary to professional judgement, plaintiff Williams has never\nbeen placed in a supervised setting appropriate to his individual needs.\n3.43.  Houston Williams experiences on a daily basis the harmful  and unlawful  conditions\ndescribed in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 below. Because the defendants have limited their community\nservices to persons who do not have severe developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors, Mr.\nWilliams remains confined and segregated at Rainier.\n3.44.  Due to the length and circumstances of his institutionalization, Houston Williams will\nrequire appropriate clinical, programmatic and habilitative services to support bis placement in a\n10 community-based program for an extended period.\n11 3.45.  If Mr. Williams is discharged from Rainier without an appropriate habilitation program and\n12 the necessary supports and services required to meet his individual needs, there is a significant likelihood\n13 that he will be deprived of his liberty by his reinstitutionalization in the future.\n14 3.46.  The failure to provide Houston Williams with the necessary support services and has\n15 II resulted in direct and immediate injury to him, has caused him physical and emotional harm, and has\n16  been the direct cause of his deterioration and regression.  This failure is unreasonable, constitutes a\n17  substantial departure from accepted professional standards, and needlessly deprives Mr. Williams of his\n18 liberty.\n19 3.47.  Plaintiff Peter Bohnke (hereinafter \"Bohnke\"), who was born on July 31,1940, was first\n20 diagnosed as having mental retardation when he was a child.  Since July 24,1947, when he was just six\n21  years old — and for the last forty-nine years — Mr. Bohnke has continuously resided and has been\n22  unnecessarily institutionalized at Rainier. He has no family who is involved in his life and activities at\n23  Rainier.\n24  3.48.  John Domenic Revello, who is a resident of Seattle, Washington, brings this action on\n25 II behalf of Peter Bohnke in his capacity as Peter Bohnke's next friend.  Mr. Revello is familiar with Peter\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage-13 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nBohnke.\n3.49.  Mr. Bohnke resides at PAT C / 2015 Quinault Court, a residential unit at Rainier for men\nwith severe developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors. Mr. Bohnke has little opportunity to\nmodel appropriate behavior or to learn how to act in the community.  He is exposed without respite to\npersons whose behaviors are at least as problematic as his own.\n3.50.  Due  to  the  severity  of  his  developmental  disabilities,  Peter  Bohnke  has  limited\ncommunication skills, as well as difficulty with activities of daily living.  He engages in stereotypical,\nperseverative behaviors that are the result of his long institutionalization.  The irony is that because of\nthe disabilities that were created in part by prolonged institutionalization and inadequate habilitation,\n10 plaintiff Bohnke is now considered inappropriate for community living.  The defendants refuse  to\n11 consider him for community living on the ground that he requires specialized supports — supports that\n12 they have chosen to provide only at Rainier.\n13 3.51.  Peter Bohnke and the other men in his residential unit have little or no choice about when\n14 to wake up and go to bed, what to eat, or what to do from day to day. Mr. Bohnke was placed at Rainier\n15 because of his severe developmental disability and challenging behavior, and because the State of\n16 Washington and the defendants' predecessors only served people with his disabilities at institutions like\n17 Rainier.\n18 3.52.  Mr. Bohnke never leaves Rainier, and rarely leaves his residential unit, mostly because the\n19  defendants have frequently restrained him twenty-four hours a day for weeks at a time with a variety of\n20 inappropriate and discriminatory physical and chemical restraints, as well as aversive therapies.  These\n21 restraints and therapies have included: physical restraints, antipsychotic medications, manual holds,\n22 locking helmets, and prolonged five-point prone restraints, along with other forms of restraint and\n23 therapies, despite the fact that these interventions have had little effect on decreasing the frequency or\n24 severity of Mr. Bohnke's challenging behaviors.\n25 3.53.  During his forty-nine years at Rainier, Mr. Bohnke has had little or no opportunity to\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nII  Seattle, Washington 98370\n\"  Page - 14  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\npractice vocational skills, recreational skills, or community living skills.  His environment is barren,\nmonotonous, and unpleasant.  He is currently condemned to live from day to day without hope or\ncompanionship.  Mr. Bohnke's current habilitation program is provided less than two hours a day and\ndoes not constitute active treatment according to accepted professional standards.\n3.54.  Despite  the  fact  that  Peter  Bohnke  could  live  in  the  community  with  appropriate\nhabilitation, vocational training, and support services, he experiences on a daily basis the harmful and\nunlawful conditions described in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 below.  Because the defendants have\ndiscriminated in the development and operation of their community services against persons who they\nperceive as having severe developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors, he has no alternative\n10  to Rainier.\n11  3.55.  Plaintiff Dawn Lavery (hereinafter \"Lavery\"), who was born on June 24,1956, was first\n12  diagnosed as having mental retardation when she was a child.  Since February 26,1973, when she was\n13  just 16 years old — and for the last twenty-three years — Ms. Lavery has continuously resided and has\n14  been unnecessarily institutionalized at Rainier.  She has no family who is involved in her life and\n15  activities at Rainier.\n16  3.56.  Emerson Fosner, who is a resident of Tacoma, Washington, is the duly-appointed legal\n17  guardian for Dawn Lavery, pursuant to an order of the Superior Court for King County, Washington.\n18  Emerson Fosner brings this action on behalf of Dawn Lavery in his capacity as his ward's next friend\n19  and legal guardian.\n20  3.57.  Ms. Lavery resides at PAT B / Tyee House, a residential unit at Rainier for men and\n21  women  with severe developmental  disabilities and challenging behaviors.  Ms. Lavery has little\n22  opportunity to model appropriate behavior or to learn how to act in the community.  She is exposed\n23  without respite to persons whose behaviors are at least as problematic as her own.\n24 H  3.58.  Due  to  the  severity  of  her  developmental  disabilities,  Dawn  Lavery  has  limited\n25 communication skills, as well as difficulty with activities of daily living.  She engages in stereotypical,\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage-15 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nperseverative behaviors that are the result of her long institutionalization.  The irony is that because of\nthe disabilities that were created in part by institutionalization and inadequate habilitation,  plaintiff\nLavery is now considered inappropriate for community living.  The defendants refuse to consider her\nfor community living on the ground that she requires specialized supports — supports that they have\nchosen to provide only at Rainier.\n3.59.  Plaintiff Lavery lives in a barren residence with stark, institutional furniture, a television\nblaring for most of the day, and little else to do. Ms. Lavery and the other individuals in her residential\nunit have little or no choice about when to wake up and go to bed, what to eat, or what to do from day\nto day. Plaintiff Lavery was placed at Rainier because of her developmental disability and challenging\n10 behaviors, and because the State of Washington and the defendants' predecessors served people with\n11 her disabilities at institutions like Rainier.\n12 3.60.  Ms.  Lavery  rarely  leaves  her residential  unit, mostly  because  the  defendants  have\n13 frequently restrained her twenty-four hours a day for weeks at a time with a variety of physical and/or\n14 chemical  restraints.  During her twenty-three  years at Rainier, Ms. Lavery  has had  little  or  no\n15  opportunity to practice vocational skills, recreational skills, or community living skills.  She is currently\n16  condemned to live from day to day without hope or companionship.\n17  3.61.  During her twenty-three years at Rainier, Ms. Lavery has not had access to  meaningful\n18  activities, vocational training, or the opportunity to learn real-life skills in the natural environments\n19  where those skills are practiced.  Her environment is barren, monotonous, and unpleasant.  On average,\n20 she receives less than two hours of programming per day, which is neither adequate nor appropriate for\n21 her needs. Ms. Lavery's current habilitation program does not constitute active treatment according to\n22 accepted professional standards.\n23 3.62.  In  an  attempt  to  address  Dawn  Lavery's  challenging  behaviors,  Rainier  staff  has\n24 continually and regularly used a variety of inappropriate and discriminatory physical and chemical\n25 restraints, as well as aversive therapies, including the use of antipsychotic medications and other\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 16  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nunspecified manual restraints.  These restraints and therapies have included: physical restraints, cold\nwater baths, antipsychotic medications, visual occlusion, manual holds, locking helmets, and wheelchair\nrestraints, along with other forms of restraint and therapies.\n4 3.63.  Ms. Lavery's current Behavioral Treatment Plan (BTP) does not allow for the use of\n5 chemical or physical restraints.  Her BTP calls for the use of an aversive therapy known as \"visual\n6 occlusion.\"\n7 3.64.  \"Visual occlusion\" therapy, as implemented by Rainier staff, consists of \"blocking\" Ms.\n8 Lavery's vision with a screen and/or a ski mask placed over her head and eyes to address her self-\n9 injurious behavior.  This \"visual occlusion\" therapy is to be used for approximately thirty seconds or\n10 until Ms. Lavery stops the alleged self-injurious behavior, but not beyond thirty minutes.\n11 3.65.  Despite the fact that physical restraints are not to be used on Dawn Lavery, on or about\n12 August 18, 1994, she was placed in a wheelchair restraint for \"medical\" reasons for three days.\n13 3.66.  On or about August 3,1995, Dawn Lavery's hand was severely injured in a paper shredder\n14 which resulted in her being placed in wrist to wrist restraints.\n15 3.67.  On or about February 21, 1996, Rainier staff used a manual hold on Dawn Lavery on at\n16 least three  separate  occasions, despite the fact  that  this type of restraint  is not permitted  and is\n17 specifically prohibited by her BTP because it causes her self-injurious behaviors to worsen.\n18 3.68.  On or about March 15, 1996, Rainier staff restrained Dawn Lavery with a locked helmet,\n19 despite the fact that this type of restraint is not permitted by her BTP and there was no authorization\n20 from her legal guardian for this type of restraint.\n21 3.69.  On or about March 17, 1996, Rainier staff restrained Ms. Lavery with a locked helmet on\nfour separate occasions, despite the fact that this type of restraint is not permitted by her BTP.  Further,\n23 her legal guardian had not authorized Rainier to use this type of physical restraint.\n24 3.70.  Despite  the fact  that  Dawn  Lavery  could  live  in the community  with  appropriate\n25 habilitation, vocational training, and support services, she experiences on a daily basis the harmful and\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street Suite 506\nSeattle. Washington 98370\nPage • 17  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nunlawful conditions described in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 below.  Because the defendants have\ndiscriminated in the provision of community services against persons who have severe developmental\ndisabilities and challenging behaviors, Ms. Lavery remains confined and segregated at Rainier.\n3.71.  Plaintiff John Mann (hereinafter \"Mann\"), who was born on November 18,1942, was first\ndiagnosed as having mental retardation when he was a child.  Since December 15,1947, when he was\njust five years old — and for the last forty-eight years — Mr. Mann has continuously resided and has been\nunnecessarily institutionalized at Rainier. He has no family who is involved in his life and activities at\nRainier.\n3.72.  Resa Hayes, who is aresident of Spokane, Washington, brings this action on behalf of John\n10 Mann in her capacity as John Mann's next friend. Ms. Hayes, who is a member of People First, is\n11 familiar with John Mann.\n12 3.73.  John Mann resides at PAT B / Oakley House, a residential living unit at Rainier for men\n13 and women with severe developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors.  Mr. Mann has little\n14 opportunity to model appropriate behavior or to learn how to act in the community.  He is exposed\n15 without respite to persons whose behaviors are at least as problematic as his own.\n16 3.74.  Mr. Mann hardly ever leaves Rainier, and spends most of his time in his residential unit.\n17 Defendants  provide  him  with  minimal  activities  and  opportunities  for  socialization  outside  the\n18  institution.\n19 3.75.  John Mann lives in a barren residence with stark, institutional furniture, a television blaring\n20 for most of the day, and little else to do. Mr. Mann and the other individuals in his residential unit have\n21 little or no choice about when to wake up and go to bed, what to eat, or what to do from day to day.\n22 John Mann was placed at Rainier because of his developmental disability and challenging behaviors,\n23 and because the State of Washington and the defendants' predecessors served people with his disabilities\n24 at institutions like Rainier.\n25 3.76.  Due  to  the  severity  of  his  developmental  disabilities,  John  Mann  has  limited\n26\nClass Action Complaint •  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 18  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\ncommunication skills, as well as difficulty with activities of daily living.  He engages in stereotypical,\npreservative behaviors that are the result of his institutionalization.  The irony is that because of the\ndisabilities that were created in part by institutionalization and inadequate habilitation, John Mann is\nnow considered  inappropriate for community  living.  The defendants  refuse  to consider him  for\ncommunity living on the ground that he requires specialized support— support that they have chose to\nprovide only at Rainier.\n3.77.  Mr. Mann is not receiving adequate habilitation at Rainier.  During his forty-eight years\nat Rainier, he has not had access to meaningful activities, vocational training, or the opportunity to learn\nreal-life skills in the natural environments where those skills are practiced.  On average, Mr. Mann\n10 receives less than two hours of programming per day, which is neither adequate nor appropriate for his\n11 needs. Mr. Mann's current habilitation program does not constitute active treatment according to\n12 accepted professional standards.\n13 3.78.  John Mann rarely leaves his residential unit, mostly because the defendants have frequently\n14 and extensively restrained him with a variety of physical and/or chemical restraints.  During his time at\n15 Rainier, he has had little or no opportunity to practice vocational skills, recreational skills, or community\n16 living  skills. Mr.  Mann's  environment  is barren, monotonous,  and unpleasant.  He  is  currently\n17 condemned to live from day to day without hope or companionship.\n18 3.79.  In an attempt to address Mr. Mann's behaviors, Rainier staff has continually and regularly\n19 used various forms of physical and chemical restraints, as well as aversive therapies, since his admission.\n20 These restraints and therapies have included, but not been limited to: body wraps, specialized jump suits,\n21 prone restraints, manual holds, Haldol, Lithium, Mellaril, and other physical restraints and therapies.\n22 3.80.  John Mann has a severe cardiac condition that exacerbates the risk of harm he must endure\n23 when  placed  in restraints.  Despite  defendants'  acknowledgment  of this  condition,  Mr.  Mann's\n24 behavioral support plan currently allows for the use of manual restraints when he is sitting on a couch\n25 || or mat, as well as a restrictive jumpsuit restraint. In the recent past, his behavioral support plan has also\n26\nClass Action Complaint •  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 19  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nallowed for the use of prone restraint, body wraps, and other physical and chemical restraints, despite\nhis heart condition.\n3.81.  Despite the fact that John Mann could live in the community with appropriate habilitation,\nvocational  training, support  services, he experiences  on a daily basis the harmful  and  unlawful\nconditions described in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 below. Because the defendants have discriminated\nin the provision of community services against persons who have severe developmental disabilities and\nchallenging behaviors, he remains confined and segregated at Rainier.\n3.82.  Plaintiff The Arc of Washington State, Inc. (hereinafter \"Arc\"), a nonprofit corporation\nduly organized under the laws of the State of Washington in 1936, is this state's oldest and largest\n10 membership organization for individuals with developmental disabilities, their families, friends, and\n11 persons providing services to them.  Arc's administrative office is located at 1703 East State Avenue\n12 in Olympia, Washington.  It has chapters in counties across the state.\n13 3.83.  In 1936-37, the Arc drafted and successfully lobbied for the legislation that created the\n14 state's second institution for persons with developmental disabilities, now known as Rainier, because\n15 their sons and daughters with mental retardation were then excluded by law from attending their local\n16 public schools. Later, it supported the creation of the Fircrest Residential Habilitation Center in Seattle,\n17 as well as the Yakima Valley Residential Habilitation Center in Selah, Washington.  For decades, the\n18 Arc provided the mainstay of support in Olympia for appropriations to support and expand such\n19 institutions.  Gradually, however, the members of plaintiff Arc became convinced that such segregated\n20 facilities could not provide individuals with developmental disabilities with minimally adequate living,\n21 training, working, and recreational supports and opportunities.\n22 3.84.  Among the Arc's purposes is the education of individuals with disabilities, their families,\n23 and the public on issues affecting persons with developmental disabilities.  The Arc's membership\n24 includes individuals who are at risk of institutionalization  at Rainier due to their  developmental\n25 disabilities.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 20  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n3.85.  The Arc devotes considerable resources to support and promote the development of\ncommunity-based habilitation programs.  Further, the Arc seeks to render defendants aware of the\ncompetencies and potential of persons with severe developmental disabilities, and to ensure that all such\npersons, including the children of its parent members, are not forced into segregated institutional centers,\nwhich always retard, and often defeat, their personal growth and development.\n3.86.  Defendant's actions and inactions adversely effect the Arc's organizational purposes and\nthe interests of its members, as set forth and more fully described in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 below.\n8 3.87.  Plaintiff Autism Society of Washington (hereinafter \"Autism Society\") is a local chapter\nof the Autism Society of America, which provides advocacy, support, and education on issues affecting\n10 persons with autism and their families and friends.  The Autism Society's members include individuals\n11 with autism and other similar disabilities, as well as their families and friends.  The Autism Society's\n12 main administrative office is located at 15230 Fifteenth Avenue N.E. in Seattle, Washington.\n13 3.88.  Many  of the  Autism  Society's  members  include  individuals  who  currently  live  in\n14 institutions and nursing homes, and who could live in their local communities if there were appropriate\n15 habilitation programs and support services available to them.  The Autism Society's  membership\n16 includes individuals who are at risk of institutionalization  at Rainier due to their  developmental\n17 disabilities.\n18 3.89.  The Autism Society's purpose, among others, is to empower and support the self-advocacy\n19 efforts of individuals with developmental disabilities, including those individuals who are currently\n20 residing in institutions and nursing homes but could live in their local communities in non-institutional\n21 alternatives.\n22 3.90.  Defendants' actions and inactions adversely affect the Autism Society's organizational\n23 purposes and the interests of its members, as set forth and more fully  described in paragraphs 4.1\n24 through 5.12 below.\n25 3.91.  Plaintiff  Washington Protection and Advocacy System, Inc. (hereinafter  \"WPAS\"), a\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 21  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nnonprofit corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Washington, is the statewide\nprotection and advocacy system designated by the Governor of the State of Washington to protect and\nadvocate for the legal and civil rights of those citizens of this state who have physical or mental\ndisabilities, pursuant to the \"Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act\", 42 U.S.C.\n§ 6000, et ssg.; the \"Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illnesses Act\", as amended,\n42 U.S.C. § 10801, stseq.; and RCW 71A.10.080. WPAS maintains its offices at 1401 East Jefferson\nStreet, Suite 506, in Seattle, Washington.\n3.92.  As the duly designated statewide protection and advocacy system for individuals with\nmental and physical disabilities in the State of Washington, WPAS has the authority and responsibility\n10 to pursue legal, administrative, and such other appropriate remedies or relief as may be necessary to\n11 protect and advocate for the rights of those persons within the State of Washington who are or who may\n12 be eligible for treatment, services, or habilitation due to their developmental, mental, or physical\n13 disabilities.  42 U.S.C. §§ 6000, et sea., and 10801, et sea., 29 U.S.C. § 794e.\n14 3.93.  Defendants' actions and inactions adversely affect WPAS' organizational interests and the\n15 legal rights of its clients, as set forth and more fully described in paragraphs 4.1 through 5.12 below.\n16 B. Class Action Allegations\n17 3.94.  The individual plaintiffs, their legal guardians, next friends, and People First, Arc, Autism\n18 Society, and WPAS bring this action pursuant to FRCP 23(a) and (b)(l)(A) & (B), 23(b)(2), and\n19 23(b)(3) on behalf of themselves and all of the other persons similarly situated.\n20 3.95.  The plaintiff class consists of all persons who: (1) presently reside at Rainier; (2) may be\n21 admitted or are at risk of being admitted to Rainier; or (3) have been discharged from Rainier to group\n22 homes, nursing  facilities,  intermediate care facilities  for  individuals with mental retardation  and\n23 developmental disabilities, and other community living arrangements funded, operated, or licensed by\n24 the defendants after October 1, 1991.\n25 3.96.  There  are approximately  four hundred and fifty-nine individual  class members  who\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 22  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\npresently reside at Rainier. Approximately thirty individuals have been discharged from Rainier during\nthe  past  five  years.  The  number  of  class  members  who  may  be  admitted  or  are  at  risk  of\ninstitutionalization at Rainier in the future is not known to plaintiffs at the present time.\n3.97.  The defendants' actions, inactions, policies, and practices have deprived the members of\nthe plaintiff class of their rights under federal laws.  The plaintiffs seek for themselves and all of the\n6 other members of the class declaratory and injunctive relief to eliminate those  actions, inactions,\npolicies, and practices of the defendants, and to require defendants to create, develop, and establish\nstandards and procedures that do not arbitrarily deny to plaintiffs and the class those rights guaranteed\nby federal law.\n10 3.98.  That plaintiffs' complaint is proper as a class action pursuant to FRCP 23 because:\n11 a.  the class is so numerous as to make joinder of all members impracticable;\n12 b.  there are substantial questions of law and fact common to the entire class;\n13 c.  the claims of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the class theyseek to represent\nin that they are all individuals who, because of their disabilities, have bbteen, are, or in the\n14 future will be at risk of placement at Rainier, and who, as a direct result of such placement,\nhave, are, or will suffer from one or more of the violations of rights enumerated in this\n15 complaint.  The named plaintiffs herein do not in this action seek individual damages,\nwhich are specifically reserved for other actions these plaintiffs may wish to pursue;\n16\nd.  the plaintiffs' attorneys have the legal resources and experience necessary to protect\n17  all of the members of the class, and the representative plaintiffs will adequately and fairly\nrepresent the interests of the class;\n18\ne.  the defendants  have acted on grounds generally  applicable to the class, thereby\n19  making appropriate final injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a\nwhole;\n20\nf.  the prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class might establish\n21  incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants in this action; and\n22  g.  separate actions would create a risk of adjudications  with respect to  individual\nmembers of the class that would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the\n23  other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their\nability to protect their interests.\n24\n3.99.  The questions of law and fact common to the entire plaintiff class include, but are not\n25\nlimited to:\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28  p ge. 23  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\na\n\na.  Are the conditions at Rainier unconstitutional, unlawful, unsafe, and unprofessional\nas alleged herein?\nb.  Does the plaintiffs' segregation at Rainier violate, among other rights, plaintiffs' right\nto:  equal  protection  of the  laws; habilitation  in the  least  separate,  most  integrated\ncommunity setting; freedom of association; freedom of expression; the right to participate\nin public services, programs, and activities receiving federal assistance regardless of the\nseverity of the plaintiffs disabilities, medical conditions, and behavioral challenges?\nc.  Do the defendants have an obligation under the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates to provide necessary services to the representative plaintiffs and all of the other\nmembers of the class they represent in the least separate, most integrated community\nsetting?\nd.  Have the defendants  subjected the residents of Rainier to unnecessary abuse or\nneglect?\n9\ne.  Have the defendants deprived the residents of Rainier of adequate and humane care,\nhabilitation,  medical care, vocational training, and support services?\n11 f.  Have  the  defendants  failed  to  develop  and  deliver  a  professionally  designed,\nconsistently and aggressively implemented program of training, treatment, habilitation, and\n12 other services to each Rainier resident to enable her or him to function with the greatest\nself-determination and independence possible?\n13\ng.  Have  the  defendants  subjected  the  residents  of  Rainier  to  unnecessary  and\n14 inappropriate physical and chemical restraint?\n15  h.  Have the defendants  deprived the residents of Rainier of their rights to  secure\nappropriate  community-based  habilitation  and  services  in order  to  prevent  needless\n16  hospitalization and thus ensure their continued liberty?\n17  i.  Have the defendants deprived the residents of Rainier of their rights to humane and\nadequate habilitation and treatment designed to prevent further deterioration and to restore\n18  functioning sufficient to allow class plaintiffs to return to their home communities and\nensure their liberty?\n19\n20  C. Defendants\n21 3.100.  Defendant Rainier is a state-owned and state-operated institution for individuals with\n22 mental retardation and developmental disabilities located at 2120 Ryan Road in Buckley, Washington.\n23 Rainier is classified as an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (hereinafter \"ICF/MR\")\n24 under Title XIX of the SSA, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et sea., and receives federal funds under said Act.\n25 3.101. Defendant Michael Lowry (hereinafter  \"Lowry\") is sued in his official  capacity as the\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 24  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nGovernor for the State of Washington. Defendant Lowry's administrative office is located in Olympia,\nWashington, and his office mailing address is as follows: Governor's Office, Legislative Building, AS-\n13, P.O. Box 4002, Olympia, Washington  98504.\n3.102.  Under Article III of the Washington Constitution, defendant Lowry  is the state's chief\nexecutive officer,  and in his official  capacity, has, pursuant to Article III, § 5 of the Washington\nConstitution, and RCW 43.06.010, supreme executive power to execute the laws of the State of\nWashington. Defendant Lowry, in his official capacity, is charged with, and, at all times relevant herein,\nhas exercised overall responsibility, supervision, and control over the operation of all of the State of\nWashington's institutions, departments, and agencies.\n10 3.103.

OFM assists DSHS and DDD in the planning and\nestablishment of Medical Assistance programs in the State of Washington and is responsible for all\nfinancial matters related to Medical Assistance.\n3.117.  Defendant Gary Robinson (hereinafter \"Robinson\"), is sued in his official capacity as the\nActing  Director  of  OFM.  Defendant  Robinson's  administrative  office  is  located  in  Olympia,\nWashington, and his office mailing address is as follows: OFM, 300 Insurance Building, P.O. Box\n43113, Olympia, Washington  98504-3113.\n3.118.  Defendant Robinson, in his official capacity, is responsible for preparing the governor's\nannual budget to the state legislature; for financial planning of the Medical Assistance programs in\n10 Washington; for review and audit of the expenditure of funds by state agencies; for determining the\n11 amount of reserve allotments; and for ensuring that program expenditures are maintained  within\n12 legislative appropriations, pursuant to the provisions of RCW 43.41.100.

In 1992 the defendants or, where applicable, their predecessors, were informed by the\n18  Washington  State Legislative Budget Committee (hereinafter  \"LBC\") that it was commencing an\n19  investigation into issues of legislative interest connected with the \"downsizing\" of Washington's state\n20  institutions for people with developmental disabilities by moving residents to community settings.\n21  Thereafter, the LBC conducted several comprehensive tours of Rainier with independent experts and\n22  consultants who observed conditions at all of the state's institutions, including Rainier; interviewed\n23  institutional and community service administrators, staff, and resident-clients; and examined records and\n24  analyzed documents pertaining to staffing, injury, abuse, mortality, medications, and habilitation policies\n25 I and practices.\n26\nClass Action Complaint - Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights 1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 29 Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n1 3.120.  Based on that extensive investigation, the LBC concluded that the populations living in the\n2 state's developmental disability institutions and community residential programs and services, generally\n3 speaking, were not distinct in terms of problem behaviors, daily living skills, and needed services and\n4 supports.  The LBC's findings included, but were not limited to, the following:\n5 a.  Many of the current residents at state institutions could be supported successfully in\nhome and community-based placements;\n6\nb.  Placement in home and community-based settings is most conducive to personal\n7 growth and independence, and is generally more cost-effective than institutional care; and\n8 c.  Services provided in both community and institutional settings should be designed to\npromote the acquisition of independent living skills and  self-sufficiency.\n9\n3.121.  The LBC notified the defendants or, where applicable, their predecessors, of these findings,\n10\nand of the remedial measures and resource allocations necessary to address these issues in a report dated\nJanuary 14, 1993.\n12\n3.122.  At all times relevant herein, the defendants, in their official capacities, were and are under\n13\nan affirmative  obligation to make their programs, services, and activities accessible to otherwise\n14\nqualified individuals with disabilities pursuant to Title II of the ADA and Section 504.\n3.123.  At all times relevant herein, the defendants, and each of them, knew or should have known\n16\nof the policies, practices, acts and conditions alleged herein.\n17\n18\nFactual Allegations\n19\nA. How Plaintiffs came to Rainier\n20\n4.1.  Washington's original institution for persons with mental disabilities, now known as\n21\nWestern State Hospital, was organized during the territorial period.  In 1874 Congress granted lands at\n22\nSteilacoom for \"an asylum for the insane.\"  Ch.98, 18 Stat. 29, part 3 (1874).  In 1875 the territorial\n23\nlegislature named the facility the \"Hospital for the Insane in Washington Territory\" and established a\n24\nboard of trustees.  Laws of 1875, pp. 83-89.\n25\n4.2.  In 1886  the legislature authorized a \"school for the deaf mute, blind and feeble-minded\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27  Civil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 30  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nyouth of Washington Territory.\"  It was located at Steilacoom and called the School for Defectives.\nIn 1892 the superintendent praised the decision \"to discriminate against the admission of epileptics,\nparalytics, and profound idiots,\" whose entrance into the school would defeat its objectives.  J.  Laing,\nA  History  of the Provision  for  Mentally  Retarded  Children  in the  State  of  Washington,  Ph.D.\ndissertation, Univ. of Washington 96 (1955).\n4.3.  During the first session of the new State Legislature, a statute was enacted that governed\nnot only the newly renamed Western Washington Hospital for the Insane, but also the hospital \"now in\nprocess of erection at Medical Lake, in Spokane county,\" to be called the Eastern State Hospital for the\nInsane.  Laws of 1889-90, pp.  482-95. In section 29 of the Act, the Legislature demonstrated that it\n10 continued to discriminate against persons with mental retardation or other developmental disabilities,\n11 by providing that:\n12 No case of idiocy, imbecility, harmless chronic mental unsoundness, or acute mania apotu\nshall  be  committed  to the  hospital  for  the  insane;  and  whenever  in  the  opinion  of  the\n13 superintendent, after a careful examination of the case of any person committed, it shall be\nsatisfactorily ascertained by him that the party has been unlawfully committed, and that he or\n14 she comes under the rule of exemptions provided for in this section, he shall have the authority\nto discharge such person so unlawfully committed, and return him or her to the county from\n15 which committed, at county expense.\n16 4.4.  The first Legislature also made segregated education compulsory for all deaf, mute, blind\n17 or feeble-minded youth.  Laws of 1889-90, pp.  497-98.  Each county superintendent of schools was\n18 ordered to report the names of such youth to the county commissioners, who were, in turn, required to\n19 send such youth to the Washington School for Defective Youth (unless proof was provided that they\n20 were being adequately educated at home).\n21 4.5.  In 1891 the Legislature authorized erection of a separate building for the \"feeble-minded\"\n22 pupils of the Washington School for Defective Youth.  Laws of 1891, chap. 101.\n23 4.6.  In 1907 a separate State Institution for the Feeble-Minded, now known as the Lakeland\n24 Village Residential Habilitation Center, was organized at Medical Lake near Spokane, near what is now\n25 Eastern State Hospital. In 1917 the Legislature changed its name to the State Custodial School. In 1924\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 31  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nthe superintendent attacked the word \"School\" in its title, since it gave false hope to parents that their\n\"hopelessly  defective\"  children  could  be  educated  and  then  returned  home.  E;  Bixler,\nSuperintendent's Report on the State Custodial School.  Second Biennial Report of the Department of\nBusiness Control, State of Washington. (1924).\n4.7.  In 1937 the Legislature authorized a second \"Western\" State Custodial School on the west\nside of the Cascade Mountains at Buckley in rural Pierce County.  Laws of 1937, chap.  10.  That\ninstitution, now known as the Rainier Residential Habilitation Center, was open to children and adults.\nCounty superintendents of schools were required to apply for admission of all children between six and\ntwenty-one who:\n10 .... by reason of defective intellect, are rendered unable to acquire an education and/or training\nin the common schools, Provided. That they are free from loathsome or contagious diseases:\n11 Provided also, that children who are idiotic, epileptic, or afflicted in any particular that renders\nthem unfitted for companionship with other children, may be segregated and admitted at the\n12 State Custodial School located at Medical Lake ....\n13 Section 8.\n14 4.8.  Adults under the age of fifty  (50) could be committed to the Western State Custodial\n15 School, using the same commitment procedure employed for insane persons, if they were:\n16 .... determined to be feeble-minded and who are of such unoffensive habits as to make them\nproper subjects for classification, education and discipline in an institution for defectives  ...,\n17 but no insane person or those who are properly subjects for county infirmaries, hospitals or\nasylums, or cases of senile dementia shall be admitted to the Western State Custodial School.\n18\nSection 15.\n19\n4.9.  Fircrest School, now Fircrest Residential Habilitation Center, was opened in 1958 on the\n20\nsite of a former  tuberculosis  sanitarium north of Seattle for 200 \"grossly handicapped  children,\"\n21\naccording to Rainier Superintendent Wesley D. White.  7 HOPE for Retarded Children 1 (1958).  The\n22\nfollowing year it received legislative authorization.  Laws of 1959, chap. 31.\n23\n4.10.  The population totals for those individuals residing at the State's institutions for persons\n24\nwith mental retardation — Fircrest, Rainier, and its other Residential Habilitation Centers at Lakeland\n25\nVillage, Yakima Valley, Frances Haddon Morgan, and Interlake ~ peaked at 4,197 in 1968 and began\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 32  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nto decline thereafter.\n4.11.  The representative plaintiffs and all of the other members of the class they represent are\n3 institutionalized at Rainier because of the defendants' failure to serve persons with severe developmental\ndisabilities, physical disabilities, complex medical conditions, challenging behaviors, and other severe\ndisabilities in community-integrated programs and placements.  A significant number of the class\nplaintiffs were admitted to Rainier after their parents and families sought services in community-based\nprograms, but were denied such access to such programs because of the severity of their developmental\ndisabilities, physical disabilities, complex medical conditions, and/or challenging behaviors.\n4.12.  Other  class members came to Rainier after  being  discharged  or transferred  from  a\n10 community-based group home program due to the severity of their developmental disabilities, complex\n11  medical conditions, and/or challenging behaviors.  To date, the defendants' have failed or refused to\n12 prevent this practice or to ensure that group home residents are not discharged without adequate\n13 procedural due process.\n14 4.13.  Many of the members of the plaintiff class were placed at Rainier because they were\n15 initially classified, in accordance with the defendants' policies and practices of \"ranking\" people with\n16 disabilities by their level of functioning.  The defendants disproportionately consign persons classified\n17 at the lowest  level of functioning  to institutions like Rainier rather than small  community-based\n18 programs and placements, despite the fact that persons with the most significant disabilities have the\n19 greatest need for the individualized services and close personal attention that is only possible in such\n20 small community-based programs and placements.\n21 4.14.  Before their placement at Rainier, the members of the plaintiff class and, where applicable,\n22  their legal guardians, were not informed of any feasible alternatives available under the Medicaid Waiver\n23  Program, nor were they given the choice of either institutional or community-based services.\n24  4.15.  Prejudice  and stereotype continue to support the segregation of people with  severe\n25 I developmental disabilities, complex medical conditions, and/or challenging behaviors in institutions\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 33  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n1 such as Rainier, away from their families, friends, neighbors and fellow citizens.\n2\nB. Harmful Conditions at Rainier\n3\n4.16.  Rainier is a segregated institution located in a rural area outside the small town of Buckley,\n4\nWashington. All of the individuals residing at Rainier are further segregated from the local community,\nas well as the communities where they once lived, solely because of the nature and severity  of their\n6\ndisabilities.\n7\n4.17.  The conditions at Rainier are dangerous, and have caused and continue to pose an\n8\nimmediate and great threat of harm to the individuals residing there.\n9\n4.18.  Rainier is a \"total institution\" where habilitation programs, recreational activities, social\n10\nactivities, and medical care services are provided on the same institutional grounds where its residents\n11\neat and sleep. Rainier's self-contained character inhibits meaningful community involvement.  Many\n12\nresidents never leave the institution or their respective living units at all.\n13\n4.19.  The vast majority of Rainier's residents spend their days waiting out the hours.  Many of\n14\nthose residents with physical handicaps sprawl in ill-fitting wheelchairs or carts.  These individuals are\n15\nfrequently parked in day rooms or hallways unattended, or are left alone in their rooms, unattended for\n16\nhours, with no stimulation or human contact except when they are changed and fed.  Interaction between\n17\nstaff and residents is minimal.\n18\n4.20.  The physical environment at Rainier was designed for mass management and custodial\n19\ncare.  Its architecture cannot be adapted to the habilitative needs of persons with  developmental\n20\ndisabilities.  Activity space is limited to \"classrooms\" that are only used during the residents' limited\n21\n\"program hours\" and to the day rooms attached to the residents' living units.  These restricted spaces\n22\nand rooms are inadequate for habilitation and active treatment.\n23\n4.21.  The living activity space at Rainier is dehumanizing.  The facility's  physical  layout\n24\nencourages passivity and dependence rather than activity and growth.  The environment  is bare,\n25\nuncarpeted, devoid of warmth, individuality, or dignity. Living and sleeping areas are sparsely furnished\n26\n_  Class Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\no\n2'  Civil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n^°  Page-34  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nand do not contain age-appropriate furnishings associated with normal active living.  Plaintiffs are\ndenied the developmental opportunities, the sensory and intellectual stimulation, and the comfort and\npleasure that community residents obtain from their usual surroundings and conveniences in homes,\nschools, restaurants, work places and recreational facilities.\n4.22.  At best, the staff at Rainier provide bare custodial care. More often, they fail to provide\nthe attention necessary to safeguard the residents from deterioration, atrophy, physical injury and abuse.\n4.23.  In a representative case, Rainier staff have not provided plaintiff Peter Bohnke with\nappropriate attention to safeguard him from deterioration, atrophy, and physical abuse. Specifically, Mr.\nBohnke has not been adequately protected by Rainier staff from self-injurious behaviors so that he no\n10  longer has a substantial portion of his nose.\n11  4.24.  In another representative case, Rainier staff have not provided plaintiff Dawn Lavery with\n12  appropriate attention to safeguard her from deterioration, atrophy, and physical abuse.  Specifically, Ms.\n13  Lavery has been restrained excessively throughout her residency at Rainier to the point where she had\n14  been restrained to a wheelchair for such a long period of time that she lost the ability to walk.  Ms.\n15  Lavery must now use a walker to walk short distances and a wheelchair for long distances.\n16  4.25.  Defendants have created, fostered, and condoned conditions, policies, and practices at\n17  Rainier that are unreasonable and directly contrary to professionally accepted standards of habilitation,\n18  are anti-therapeutic, are emotionally debilitating, and have caused deterioration in the well-being and\n19  self-esteem of many of the members of the plaintiff class.\n20  4.26.  An essential prerequisite of appropriate habilitation is a humane environment.  At Rainier,\n21  class plaintiffs are frequently subjected to treatment from direct care staff that is totally lacking in human\n22  dignity and decreases their self-esteem.  For example, members of the class are frequently  transferred\n23  from their residence to a completely different residence at times convenient to staff, with no prior\n24  planning or notice to the individual residents or their legal representative, nor relationship to the\n25 individual resident's needs.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 35  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.27.  On information and belief, during 1995, the individual residents of the PAT C / 2025\nQuinalt Court residence decided that they wanted to purchase a \"big screen\" television set for their\npersonal use and enjoyment.  The residents, acting on their own and without staff support or supervision,\nraised the necessary money through a variety of projects and activities, and purchased a \"big screen\"\ntelevision set for their residence.  Shortly thereafter, without prior notice or explanation from staff, all\nof the individual residents were moved to other residential units at Rainier. The \"big screen\" television\nset remained at the PAT C / 2025 Quinalt Court residence, unable to be used by any of the residents who\n8 purchased it.\n9 C. Inadeouate Basic Care\n10 4.28.  Many of the plaintiffs' basic care needs are frequently ignored.  Residents are often left\n11 alone for hours.\n12 4.29.  In many residential units, staff ratios are inadequate to meet residents' basic care and\n13 attendant support needs. Due to the inadequate staffing, some of the staff who are on duty commonly\n14 ignore their clients and leave residents unattended.\n15 4.30.  Because of staff shortages at Rainier, staff often \"float\" to areas of the institution to which\n16 they are not typically assigned and care for a large number of residents whom they do not know.  This\n17 practice creates an unacceptable high risk of harm.\n18 4.31.  In a representative case, on or about February 15, 1996, Daniel Coffield, a male resident\n19 residing at Rainier was insufficiently supervised and therefore was able to leave the Rainier premises.\n20 Mr. Coffield was found dead in a nearby field by a farmer the next day, having died as a result of his\n21 exposure to the hostile weather conditions and his inability to take sufficient measures to protect himself\n22 from same. Daniel Coffield was left unsupervised despite the fact that he had a history of running away\n23 from the facility and the defendants were aware of this fact.\n24 4.32.  In another representative case, on or about December 15, 1995, Lorreta Westin, a female\n25 resident was restrained with a \"seatbelt\"on a toilet and left unsupervised.  While left alone, strapped to\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 36  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nthe toilet, Ms. Westin fell off the toilet and became unconscious.  Rainier staff subsequently found her\ncatatonic on the bathroom floor with vomit beside her face, and no pulse or respiration.  She died five\ndays later.  She was strapped to the toilet and left unsupervised despite the fact that there was at least\none other documented instance where she had fallen off the toilet in August of 1995, and had a well\ndocumented history of seizures, falling, and a need for attendant support and care.\n4.33.  Many of the direct care staff at Rainier lack the skills and training required to provide\nadequate basic care to those members of the plaintiff class who have severe disabilities, complex\nmedical needs, and/or challenging behaviors.\n4.34.  For instance, during the evening of February 12,1996, Rainier staff placed plaintiff Peter\n10 Bohnke in bed while he was wearing a locked helmet with the expectation that he would go to sleep. At\n11 about 10:30 pm later that same evening, Rainier staff found plaintiff Peter Bohnke choking on his helmet\n12 after he had tried to remove it with his hands. At that time, Mr. Bohnke's face was a bluish-purple color\n13 and it was apparent that his circulation had been cut off and that he suffered a near strangulation.  In\n14 addition, one of his hands was injured when it became caught in the locking neck/chin strap while he\n15 was attempting to remove the helmet.\n16 4.35.  In another example, plaintiff Dawn Lavery is frequently subjected to an aversive therapy\n17 known as visual occlusion for hours at a time to address her challenging behaviors. This therapy, which\n18 is provided for in Ms. Lavery's Behavioral Treatment Plan is to be used for approximately thirty seconds\n19 or until she stops the alleged behaviors, but not beyond thirty minutes.\n20\nD. Inadequate Medical Care\n21\n4.36.  Many members of the plaintiff class do not receive adequate and timely medical care or\n22\ndental care.  Their health problems often go unrecognized and untreated.\n23\n4.37.  Medical staffing at Rainier is grossly inadequate, thus depriving the residents of appropriate\n24\nand timely medical care that is consistent with currently accepted professional standards.\n25\n4.38.  The number of adequately trained nurses at Rainier is insufficient  to meet the current\n26 Class Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\n27\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 37  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nresidents' health care and psychological treatment needs.\n4.39.  Nursing staff are hired without adequate experience or training in caring for individuals\nwith severe developmental disabilities, complex medical conditions, and challenging behaviors, and do\nnot receive sufficient in-service training in these areas after they begin working at Rainier.\n4.40.  Due to the lack of properly trained and experienced medical staff, Rainier residents receive\ninadequate preventive and ongoing care. Instead, medical care is characterized by \"crisis management\",\nwhich inevitably causes a decline in the health of the residents. These problems could be avoided if the\ndefendants would hire properly trained and/or experienced physicians and nursing staff in sufficient\nnumbers to meet the medical needs of Rainier's current residents, or, in the alternative, insure that the\n10 residents can access appropriate medical care in the community, in order to treat their ongoing health\n11 care needs.\n12 4.41.  In a representative case, for the past several months Chad Phillips has had a large, infected\n13 growth resembling an epithelial carcinoma tumor on his leg which caused him a great deal of discomfort\n14 and fear.  Mr. Phillips has a legal guardian who has abused him in the past, and this fact is known to the\n15 Rainier staff.  Mr. Phillips has repeatedly requested medical assistance to treat and/or remove this\n16 growth, however, to date, Rainier staff have refused to provide Mr. Phillips with any form of medical\n17 treatment because Mr. Phillips' legal guardian has refused to respond to their requests that he consent\n18 to medical treatment for his ward. Consequently, this infected growth has not been treated and continues\n19 to cause Mr. Phillips' great pain.\n20 4.42.  Seizure management is deficient at Rainier.  Many residents with seizure disorders have\n21 not been seen by a neurologist for several years.  Some residents continue to receive anticonvulsant\n22 medications long after they have stopped having seizures, while others receive grossly sub-therapeutic\n23 doses of the anticonvulsant medications they need.  The inconsistent recording of seizures by Rainier\n24 staff seriously compromises the rationale for, and the efficacy of, prescribed medications and treatment.\n25 4.43.  Emergency medical care at Rainier is inadequate. The institution has no written guidelines\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 38  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nprescribing when 911 should be called.  Residents who need immediate emergency medical care are\ntransported from their living units to the medical building by non-medical personnel such as security\nofficers when they should be taken by emergency medical technicians directly to the hospital.\n4.44.  Psychiatric  services at Rainier are seriously deficient.  The psychiatric  consultation\ncurrently available at Rainier is limited to a part-time (.6 FTE) psychiatrist under contract, which is\ncompletely inadequate to supervise and monitor the care of the hundreds of Rainier residents who are\nreceiving psychoactive medications or require intensive behavioral supports due to their complex\nconditions and challenging behaviors.\n4.45.  Defendants' failure to adequately monitor the effects of these psychoactive medications\n10 and the failure to monitor implementation of individual treatment plans is dangerous to residents.  It\n11 greatly enhances the risk that psychoactive medications and physical restraints will be used instead of\n12 active treatment and non-aversive behavioral intervention strategies.\n13 4.46.  In a representative case, plaintiff Peter Bohnke, suffered several seizures as a result of the\n14 antipsychotic medication, Clozaril, that had been prescribed for him by a Rainier psychiatrist's order.\n15 Finally, on or about April 9,1996, Mr. Bohnke, suffered from agranulocytosis as a result of his reaction\n16 to the Clozaril that he was still taking pursuant to the same psychiatrist's order.  Agranulocytosis is an\n17 acute disease in which the white blood cell count drops to extremely low levels.  As a result of this\n18 condition, Mr. Bohnke had to be hospitalized in the Rainier infirmary.  After a prolonged delay, the\n19 Clozaril was finally discontinued.\n20 4.47.  Rainier staff members often present conflicting data about residents to the psychiatrist that,\n21 in turn, may lead to inappropriate prescriptions and administration of psychoactive medications.\n22 4.48.  Rainier's procedures for tracking medication side-effects  is similarly deficient.  This\n23 absence compounds the risk of harmful side-effects and jeopardizes the rights and liberty of those class\n24 members who are unnecessarily medicated.  Many of Rainier's current residents exhibit visible signs\n25 of the negative side-effects resulting from inappropriate prescriptions and excessive administration of\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 39  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\npsychoactive medications.\n4.49.  Medical  care and services provided  to the residents  of Rainier  are inadequate and\ninconsistent with their identified  needs and abilities, and with accepted standards of professional\npractice.\n4.50.  Medical care and services provided to the residents of Rainier are distinctly different, less,\nand far more segregated when compared with the medical care and services provided to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities in the community.\n4.51.  The significant lapses in the medical care and services provided to residents of Rainier are\nunacceptable. They compromise the plaintiffs' long-range outlook and create an undue risk of physical\n10 harm and loss of life.\n11\nE. Excessive Injury and Abuse\n12\n4.52.  Residents' safety at Rainier is constantly at risk. The rate of injury is alarmingly high.\n13\nMany of the injuries are of unknown cause and were unobserved at the time they occurred.\n14\n4.53.  In congregate care settings such as Rainier, residents with maladaptive behaviors will hurt\n15\nother residents.  This risk is severe at Rainier, where residents suffer injuries and assaults on a regular\n16\nbasis and are at serious risk of harm in their own living units and throughout the institution.\n17\n4.54.  The defendants do not make reasonable professional attempts to prevent injury at Rainier.\n18\nSome residents push, hit and bite other residents, often causing injury serious enough to require stitches\n19\nor loss of teeth, in plain view of staff.\n20\n4.55.  The lack of trained staff, non-implementation of individual programs, and the almost\n21\ncomplete lack of activity or stimulation in the units contributes significantly to the high rate of injury\n22\nand death.\n23\n4.56.  Rainier does not conduct the analysis needed to prevent recurrence of avoidable injuries.\n24\nWithout adequate reporting of data on causes and patterns of injuries, it is impossible to know how to\n25\nprevent them.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 40  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.57.  The defendants have failed to protect Rainier residents from physical abuse and neglect.\n4.58.  For example, during February 1996, Daniel Coffield, a male resident residing at Rainier,\nwas insufficiently supervised, due to the defendants' failure to insure that there was sufficient direct care\nstaff to meet the needs of the institution's residents, thus allowing Mr. Coffield to leave his residential\nunit and the Rainier grounds without the knowledge of his residence's direct care staff.  Mr. Coffield\nwas found dead in a nearby field by a farmer the next day.  Mr. Coffield was left unsupervised and\nallowed to \"wander off',  despite the fact that he had a history of running away from the facility and the\nRainier staff was aware of this fact.\n9 4.59.  Verbal abuse of residents is widespread at Rainier.  Staff uses abrupt, verbal commands\n10 to communicate with residents; often, they scream at residents.\n11 4.60.  Staff reporting of abuse or neglect is not adequately monitored or supervised at Rainier.\n12 Some staff use intimidation to prevent other staff from reporting such incidents. In a representative case,\n13 when plaintiff Peter Bohnke choked on his locked helmet while in bed on February 12,1996 and almost\n14 died, Rainier staff did not even complete an incident report, as is required by the policies of DSHS and\n15 DDD, as well as Rainier.\n16 4.61.  Resident abuse investigations are cursory, and many potential incidents of abuse are never\n17 investigated, in violation of DSHS and Rainier policies and regulations.  Those investigations that are\n18 carried out typically conclude with a finding that the allegation is not substantiated, even in cases in\n19 which the evidence suggests that abuse did occur.\n20 4.62.  Neglect of residents at Rainier is common. Residents are left for extended periods in soiled\n21 clothes or engaging in self-injurious behavior unattended with no staff intervention.  For example,\n22 during  December  1995, Loretta  Westin  was  restrained  with  a  \"seat  belt\"  on  a  toilet  and  left\n23 unsupervised.  While left  alone strapped to the toilet, Ms. Westin fell  off the toilet and became\n24 unconscious.  Sometime later, Rainier staff found her catatonic, lying on the bathroom floor with vomit\n25 beside her face, and no pulse or respiration.  Ms. Westin died five days later.  She was strapped to the\n26\n27 Class Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\n28 Seattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 41  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\ntoilet and left unsupervised despite the fact that she had fallen off the toilet at least once before (August\n1995) and had a well-documented history of falling and seizure disorders.\n4.63.  Defendants' policies and practices to prevent abuse and neglect of Rainier residents, as well\nas their staff training activities on prevention, are inadequate and inconsistent with accepted standards\n5  of professional practice.\n6\nF. Inadequate Habilitation and Training\n7\n4.64.  Habilitation is the teaching and training process required by persons with  significant\n8\ndisabilities so that they can reach their fullest potential in physical, social and mental growth.\n9\n4.65.  Nearly all persons with significant disabilities have the capability, with proper education\n10\nand training, to learn some basic self-care skills: to participate in feeding, toileting, mobility and other\nbodily needs.  Most of Rainier's current residents could, with proper individualized instruction and\n12\nadaptations, more fully participate in their self-help functioning.\n13\n4.66.  Active treatment is the formal process of training, treatment and care that must be delivered\n14\nto each Medicaid-eligible resident of in Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR).\n15\nActive treatment is a professionally designed, consistently and aggressively implemented program of\n16\ntraining, treatment, and other services to enable each ICF/MR resident to function with the greatest self-\n17 11\ndetermination and independence possible. 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d); 42 C.F.R. § 483.440.\n18\n4.67.  Active treatment requires the development and implementation  of an  individualized\n19\nprogram of intervention that is based upon and accountable to a comprehensive assessment of the\n20\nindividual needs of the resident and an Individual Program Plan (IPP). Assigning an ICF/MR resident\n21\nto a generic activity (one that is generally available at a facility) is not active treatment unless the activity\n22\nfulfills an individual goal or objective that, in turn, addresses an assessed need of the individual resident.\n23\n42. C.F.R. § 483.440(a), (c)(3), (c)(4), (d)(3).\n24\n4.68.  No  long-term  view  for  each  individual  resident  leading  to  greater  independence,\n25\nproductivity and integration guides the program planning process for residents of Rainier.  Long-term\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 42  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nviews are the basic first-step to the development of an adequate IPP.\n4.69.  At Rainier, IPPs are meaningless as a guide to habilitation.  They frequently ignore the\nresidents' individual needs, even when those needs are obvious and substantial.\n4.70.  Rainier residents' IPPs fail to specify the specific interventions needed to support the\nperson toward independence.  Their IPPs also fail to provide training in personal and functional skills\nessential for privacy and independence.\n4.71.  Rainier residents' IPPs fail to identify the mechanical supports needed to achieve proper\nbody position, balance or alignment, as well as the reasons for each support and the situation in which\neach is to be applied.\n10 4.72.  Residents'  IPPs  also  fail  to  include  opportunities  for  individual  choice  and  self-\n11 management.  Class members are not offered reasonable treatment choices and alternatives.  Individual\n12 program plans do not reflect the expressed needs and opimons of the individual residents or her or his\n13 family/legal guardian.\n14 4.73.  Most of the residents' IPP goals are \"canned,\" not individualized.  Plans and programs for\n15 Rainier residents with different levels of ability are virtually identical.\n16 4.74.  The defendants do not revise and update Rainier residents' IPP plans and programs in light\n17 of each resident's changing needs. Instead, their IPPs often remain unchanged from one year to the next.\n18 4.75.  The number of professional staff who work at Rainier is inadequate.\n19 4.76.  The professional staff who are employed at Rainier do not adequately monitor the delivery\n20 of the programs they develop for class members.  There is no effective method to ensure quality and\n21 consistency of performance among direct care staff.\n22 4.77.  The direct care staff at Rainier have little knowledge of the persons for whom they have\n23 care giving responsibility and thus are unaware of the significant issues in their lives.\n24 4.78.  The direct care staff at Rainier are not adequately trained to carry out their clients'\n25 individual  program plans and often do not even know the content of those plans.  They do not\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 43  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nunderstand their clients' needs nor the techniques required to teach them functional skills.  They do not\nknow how to collect meaningful progress data.\n4.79.  At Rainier, accurate and meaningful data are not kept that can show progress, regression\nor lack of change.\n4.80.  Rainier lacks the capability to deliver active treatment because the basic components of\nactive  treatment  — adequate  professional  staff,  functioning  interdisciplinary  teams,  adequate\nassessments, professionally-designed  individual habilitation plans, and direct care staff trained and\nsupervised in the delivery of each resident's plan — do not exist.\n4.81.  Rainier staff fail to carry out active treatment programs for class members, especially for\n10 those  individuals  with  severe  physical  disabilities,  complex  medical  conditions,  or  challenging\n11 behaviors.  Class members spend only a fraction of their time in program-related activities.\n12 4.82.  Untrained, unsupervised, unfamiliar with their client's needs and abilities and unaware of\n13 what is expected of them, Rainier staff often stand idle in a roomful of Rainier residents — or they\n14 socialize with one another and ignore the residents.\n15 4.83.  Rainier residents receive little attention from staff, and rarely interact with anyone other\n16 than a paid staff member.  Most of their time is \"dead time.\" They spend long periods \"waiting\" to go\n17 from one activity to another, engaging in self-stimulation, rocking, milling around, dozing, or simply\n18 doing nothing.\n19 4.84.  The interdisciplinary teams for each resident at Rainier do not have a sufficient array of\n20 services available to make reasonable habilitation decisions that meet the needs of the individual\n21 residents.\n22 4.85.  The amount of habilitation services offered to each class member at Rainier is grossly\n23 inadequate to meet their individual needs or to qualify as active treatment.  Most residents receive two\n24 hours or less of planned habilitation each day.\n25 4.86.  The individual habilitation, vocational training, and behavior modification programs at\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage -44  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facslmile: (206) 324-1783\n\nRainier depart substantially from current professional judgment, standards, and practices.  They are\ninappropriate to the learning needs of persons with severe intellectual disabilities.\n4.87.  Individual habilitation, vocational training, and behavior modification programs at Rainier\ndo not teach functional skills. Residents of Rainier are denied the opportunity to learn the skills of daily\nliving, such as dressing and tooth-brushing.  In the living units, there are no materials that can be used\nto teach age-appropriate, functional skills. Further, many of the objects and possessions that are found\nin these environments are age-inappropriate.\n4.88.  Many Rainier residents are capable of going to the store, choosing and purchasing then-\nfood, cooking and serving meals and caring for their own living units, but they have no opportunity to\n10 do so.  Staff cook and clean while the residents remain idle.\n11 4.89.  The defendants do not provide the residents of Rainier with adequate  individualized\n12 adaptions to enable them to do things for themselves. Adaptive equipment is generally not available to\n13 residents who need it in their education and living areas.\n14 4.90.  Communication and cooperation between cottage and adult education programs at Rainier\n15 are virtually nonexistent.\n16 4.91.  Rainier residents' opportunities to interact with non-disabled persons and to spend time\n17 outside the institution is extremely limited.  Residents of the institutions receive little or no community-\n18 based instruction.  They have little or no opportunity to learn skills that will enable them to function in\n19 their communities, such as acting and dressing appropriately in public, eating in a restaurant, going to\n20 a movie, or crossing streets.\n21 4.94.  Recreational and leisure-time services, supports, and activities provided to the residents\n22 of Rainier are inadequate and inconsistent with their identified needs and abilities, or with accepted\n23 standards of professional practice.\n24 4.95.  Recreational and leisure-time services, supports, and activities provided to the residents\n25 of Rainier are distinctly different, less, and far more segregated when compared with the recreational\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 45  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nand leisure-time services, supports, and activities provided to individuals with developmental disabilities\nin the community.\n4.96.  Habitation at Rainier does not lead to greater independence, productivity, and social\nintegration. The quality of life of persons at Rainier is unacceptable because it offers no opportunity for\nprogress, participation in valued life activities, daily life style choices, privacy, safety, dignity or hope\nfor improvement.\n4.97.  The consequences of the defendants' failure to provide active treatment at Rainier, or to\ncarry out professional recommendations for placement elsewhere, are devastating to class members.\nTheir basic needs are neglected, their time is wasted, their bodies are constricted, they develop behavior\n10 problems. Many residents, like plaintiff Lavery, lose basic skills such as the ability to speak and walk.\n11 The defendants also deprive class members of the opportunity to live in a decent home and to build\n12 relationships with non-disabled people. Their human potential is wasted.\n13\nG. Inadequate Behavior Management\n14\n4.98.  Appropriate behavior management programs and supports are important components of\n15\nhabilitation and active treatment.  However, at Rainier, programs to deal with plaintiffs'  behavioral\n16\nproblems are seriously deficient.  As a result, physical and chemical restraints are used as a substitute\n17\nfor  appropriate  care and programs, with the consequence that residents'  behavioral problems are\n18\nexacerbated and escalate.\n19\n4.99.  Rainier residents do not have the environmental and physical supports to develop and\n20\nmaintain positive behaviors. Without those supports, behavior management techniques are ineffective\n21\nand reduced to crisis intervention after harm and injury have already occurred.\n22\n4.100.  Rainier does not properly conduct the assessments needed to develop effective programs\n23\nof behavioral  support.  Few, if any, functional  behavioral analyses, which are the foundation  for\n24\ndeveloping adequate behavior intervention strategies, are conducted.\n25\n4.101.  The defendants do not individualize behavior modification and behavior support programs\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 46  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nfor each resident.  Programs for different persons are virtually identical. The programs are incomplete,\nincoherent, and implemented inconsistently.\n4.102.  Documentation of residents' behavior is inaccurate, unreliable, inconsistent and incomplete.\nData collected on residents' behavioral and skill training programs are often identical from day to day,\ngiving the appearance that data is fabricated or recorded at the end of the day, week or month.  The\nmeaningless quality of the data deprives professional  staff of the information necessary to make\nprofessional, appropriate and safe decisions regarding the residents' behavioral support needs.\n4.103.  Rainier staff does not have the skills and competence necessary to appropriately implement\nbehavioral interventions or to develop appropriate individual program plans.  Staff intervention to\n10 manage inappropriate behavior has no clear treatment objectives or positive long-term effect.\n11 4.104.  In place of adequate behavioral support, staff at Rainier practice emergency physical\n12 restraint.  This is an inherently risky procedure that places residents at serious risk of injury and death.\n13 4.105.  Without adequate programming and non-aversive behavioral intervention strategies to\n14 teach positive behavior, Rainier residents are subjected to unnecessary restraint.\n15 4.106.  Psychoactive medication for control of behavior is used at Rainier outside of and not in\n16 conjunction with individuals' IPPs and in violation of ICF/MR standards.\n17 4.107.  Rainier  staff  often  physically restrains Rainier residents when the demands  of their\n18 individual habilitation needs or challenging behaviors become inconvenient to staff.\n19 4.108.  Defendants'  failure to adequately develop, carry out, and monitor residents'  behavior\n20 support programs, as needed, is dangerous to residents.  It greatly enhances the residents' risk of harm\n21 and safety from Rainier staffs dependance on chemical and/or physical restraints due to the lack of\n22 appropriate, non-aversive behavior support programs.\n23 4.109.  Rainier  staff  is often  unfamiliar  with the behavioral programs of the residents they\n24 supervise.\n25 4.110.  In a representative case, plaintiff Dawn Lavery has repeatedly been subjected to aversive\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 47  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nand anti-therapeutic forms of physical restraint in lieu of a properly implemented behavioral program\nbecause the Rainier staff are unfamiliar with Ms. Lavery's behavioral program.\n4.111.  In a representative case, plaintiff Peter Bohnke has repeatedly been subjected to aversive,\nanti-therapeutic,  and prolonged  forms  of physical  and chemical  restraints  in lieu of a properly\nimplemented behavioral program because the Rainier staff are unfamiliar with Mr. Bohnke's behavioral\nprogram.\n4.112.  The inability of Rainier staff to deal with continual behavior problems results in more\n8 frequent accidents and injuries to class members.\n4.113.  The behavioral modification and support practices at Rainier are inadequate to prevent or\n10 reduce the incidence of abuse and injury to class members, or to ensure their freedom from undue\n11 restraint.\n12 4.114.  Behavioral modification services, supports, and activities provided to the residents of\n13 Rainier are inadequate and inconsistent with their identified needs and abilities, or with accepted\n14 standards of professional practice.\n15 4.115.  Behavioral modification services, supports, and activities provided to the residents of\n16 Rainier are distinctly different,  less, and far more segregated when compared with the behavioral\n17 modification services, supports, and activities provided to individuals with developmental disabilities\n18 in the community.\n19\nH. Inadequate Physical Therapy and Physical Management\n20\n4.116.  Many Rainier residents who have contractures or are non-ambulatory require physical\n21\ntherapy and frequent positioning and repositioning in order to prevent skin breakdown and muscle and\n22\njoint deterioration.\n23\n4.117.  Physical therapy services at Rainier are seriously deficient.  Direct care and professional\n24\nstaff are untrained in how to properly position, transfer or move residents. Programs are inadequate and\n25\ninconsistently implemented despite the residents' identified needs and their IPPs.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27  Civil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 48  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.118.  Rainier staff does not position residents properly for sitting, eating or other activities\nrequiring proper body alignment or support.\n4.119.  Rainier staff place residents with physical disabilities in inappropriate positions or allow\nthem to remain in devices or postures that inhibit their ability to function and may even exacerbate their\ndeformities.\n4.120.  Therapeutic  equipment  helps to  hold  a  developmentally  disabled  person's  body  in\nalignment, prevent the progression of deformity and allow the person to move as normally as s\\he can.\n8 With proper individualized therapeutic equipment, persons with severe developmental disabilities,\nsevere physical disabilities and deformities, and severe and profound mental retardation can achieve\n10 better alignment, better control of their muscles and limbs, and more normal and varied movements.\n11 They can learn to sit in more upright positions that facilitate growth and learning.\n12 4.121.  Rainier does not provide adequate assistive devices to enable residents to walk, move, or\n13 communicate.  Individual residents who could walk and move with assistance are  unreasonably\n14 prevented from doing so and lose the ability to walk altogether.  Individual residents who could learn\n15 to express their needs, wants, and desires by using assistive devices are prevented from doing so.\n16 4.122.  Because of improper positioning and the lack of adequate physical therapy, residents'\n17 deformities actually have increased through the loss of existing motor skills and physical abilities.\n18 4.123.  The lack of proper positioning and therapy has also led to osteoporosis, kidney stones,\n19 digestive difficulties, circulatory problems, respiratory problems, and deterioration of normal function,\n20 growth, sensory, and cognitive abilities.\n21 4.124.  Physical therapy services, supports, and activities provided to the residents of Rainier are\n22 inadequate and inconsistent with their identified needs and abilities, and with accepted standards of\n23 professional practice.\n24 4.125.  Physical therapy services, supports, and activities provided to the residents of Rainier are\n25 distinctly different, less, and far more segregated when compared with the physical therapy services,\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 49  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n1  supports, and activities provided to individuals with developmental disabilities in the community.\n2\nI. Inadequate Occupational Therapy\n3\n4.126.  Occupational therapy is a component of habilitation and active treatment.  Occupational\n4\ntherapists help people with disabilities to master the functional activities of everyday living and meet\nthe demands of their environment.\n4.127.  Because occupational therapy is environmentally and contextually bound, the limitations\nof the environment at Rainier limits the ability of occupational therapists at Rainier to train or teach.\nOccupation therapists cannot adequately teach community living skills there because the environment\nof the institution is completely unlike the community.\n4.128.  The occupational therapy services, supports, and activities provided to the residents of\nRainier are inadequate and inconsistent with their identified needs and abilities, and with accepted\nstandards of professional practice.\n4.129.  The occupational therapy leisure-time services, supports, and activities provided to the\nresidents of Rainier are distinctly different,  less, and far more segregated when compared with the\nrecreational  and  leisure-time  services,  supports,  and  activities  provided  to  individuals  with\ndevelopmental disabilities in the community.\n19 4.130.  Communication services are an important part of habilitation and active treatment.  If the\n20 defendants do not provide people with developmental disabilities with adequate services and supports\n21 to address their speech and language needs, they will regress.\n22 4.131.  Little speech and language therapy is conducted at Rainier.  As a result, residents do not\n23 receive the speech/language therapy and services they need to improve or maintain their ability to\n24  understand  others  and  communicate  their  needs.  Augmentative  devices  to  enable  residents  to\n25 communicate are virtually nonexistent or are not in use.  Staff do not attempt to communicate with\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 50  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nresidents in sign language, although some residents could benefit from learning sign language.\n4.132.  The defendants have failed to provide class members with assistive technology and other\nmethods through which many persons previously labeled severely and profoundly retarded have learned\nto communicate and express ideas.  As a result of this failure, coupled with the defendants' pervasive\ndenial  of  appropriate  habilitation  and vocational  programs  for  class  members,  defendants  have\ndiminished and failed to protect the capacity of class members to produce ideas by thinking and learning,\nand to express those ideas through communication.\n4.133.  Speech and language therapy services, supports, and activities provided to the residents of\nRainier are inadequate and inconsistent with their identified needs and abilities, and with accepted\n10 standards of professional practice.\n11 4.134.  Speech and language therapy services, supports, and activities provided to the residents of\n12 Rainier are distinctly different,  less, and far more segregated when compared with the speech and\n13 language  therapy  services,  supports,  and  activities  provided  to  individuals  with  developmental\n14 disabilities in the community.\n15\nK. Inadequate Vocational Training and Employment Opportunities\n16\n4.135.  Individuals with severe intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior can participate\n17\nin productive work and work at real jobs in real workplaces.\n18\n4.136.  With individualized systematic instruction and practice, most of the residents at Rainier\n19\nare able to learn and maintain vocational skills.\n20\n4.137.  The opportunity to use and practice vocational skills in real work settings gives persons\n21\nsevere disabilities not only with the benefits of earning wages and decreasing their dependence on public\n22\nsupport, but also provides the benefits of participating in the community in a valued role and developing\n23\nrelationships with their co-workers, friends and other non-disabled people who are not paid to be with\n24\nthem.  Opportunities to work in real job settings allows for modeling and learning appropriate work\n25\nhabits and social behaviors from non-disabled peers, something that is not possible at Rainier.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 51  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.138.  There are no systematic attempts to develop true vocational programs for Rainier residents.\nThe programs called \"vocational\" at Rainier are not truly vocational because they do not lead to real\njobs, nor do they teach skills that can prepare the class plaintiffs for real jobs.\n4.139.  Meaningful opportunities for employment and vocational training at Rainier are severely\nlimited due to the inadequacies and limitations of Rainier's vocational training programs.  Most of the\nresidents \"lucky\" enough to receive or participate in Rainier's vocational training program receive less\nthan two hours of vocational training per day. Approximately seventy-five per cent of the institution's\n8  current residents do not participate in or receive any form of vocational training at Rainier.\n4.140.  Employment opportunities and vocational services, supports, and activities provided to the\n10  residents of Rainier are inadequate and inconsistent with their identified needs and abilities, and with\n11  accepted standards of professional practice.\n12  4.141.  Employment opportunities and vocational services, supports, and activities provided to the\n13  residents of Rainier are distinctly different,  less, and far more segregated when compared with the\n14  employment opportunities and vocational services, supports, and activities provided to individuals with\n15  developmental disabilities in the community.\n16\nL. Denial of Personal Choice. Dignity. Privacy, and Freedom of Association\n17\n4.142.  The defendants routinely deprive Rainier residents of their dignity. Staff interact with them\n18\neither as children or objects to be managed. Rainier staff are allowed to treat residents with indifference,\n19\nand to abuse and neglect them without consequence.\n20\n4.143.  Rainier residents are denied privacy because of the lack of adequate staff to help residents\n21\nwith intimate bodily functions in private.\n22\n4.144.  Rainier residents are routinely denied the basic rights of freedom  of association and\n23\ncommunication, access to personal property, and participation in community activities.\n24\n4.145.  The overwhelming majority of the members of the plaintiff class are denied an adequate\n25\nopportunity to participate in community activities.  Some never leave the institution at all.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n^'  Civil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 52  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.146.  Residents of Rainier experience acute social isolation.  The living, learning and working\nenvironments for the vast majority of residents are completely segregated from the community.  Class\nplaintiffs have little or no opportunity to acquire and practice life skills in typical settings, such as home,\nsocial functions, or work sites in the community. They have little or no opportunity to make friends who\nare non-disabled who are not paid staff.\n4.147.  Members of the plaintiff class are denied the right to make basic choices about their lives\nthat other citizens take for granted. They have no opportunity to make basic decisions for themselves.\n8 4.148.  The defendants have denied plaintiffs their right to freedom of association and expression\nby restricting their access to community activities, friendships and visitation.  Plaintiffs are denied the\n10 opportunity to leave the facility to participate in outside community activities.\n11 4.149.  Rainier residents are denied the right to marry or to enjoy intimate relationships.  The\n12 policy and practice of the institution is to separate residents who wish to engage in sexual activity.\n13 4.150.  Rainier fails to monitor the residents' personal property or to protect it from theft.\n14 4.151.  Members of the plaintiff class are denied the right to attend religious services in the faith\n15 and congregation of their choice. Most class plaintiffs do not have the choice of attending services off\n16 campus because they are not provided with transportation to do so. In this regard, many class plaintiffs\n17 are denied their right to freely exercise their respective religious beliefs, since the services offered at the\n18 institution do not and cannot reflect the variety of class members' religious preferences.\n19 4.152.  Residents of Rainier spend nearly all their time in their living units and rarely, if ever, are\n20 allowed to recreate out of doors.\n21 4.153.  Many of the members of the plaintiff class are denied the right to make the basic choices\n22 about their lives that other citizens take for granted.  They have no opportunity to learn to make\n23 decisions for themselves.\n24 4.154.  The  size, scale, isolation  and segregation of Rainier present  almost  insurmountable\n25 impediments to the exercise of basic rights. Residents are assigned to large groups within the institution\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 53  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nbecause of the logistical needs of the facility and cannot choose with whom to associate.  This \"group\"\napproach to life precludes choice for most residents.\n4.155.  More than half of the class members do not have legal guardians and therefore, defendant\nLamb and/or her designees make decisions on behalf of these individuals that has the effect of not only\nresulting in a conflict of interest, but also of preventing those class plaintiffs from exercising their basic\nrights.\n7\nM. Inadequate Discharge Planning\n8\n4.156.  Post-discharge planning and follow-along services at Rainier are inadequate.  Several\n9\nRainier residents have been discharged from the institution without adequate effort to assure that they\n10\nwill receive the proper support in an alternative community-based setting.  As a result, these Rainier\n11\nresidents who have been discharged are at risk of harm and of readmission to Rainier.\n12\n4.157.  During the past five years, Rainier has discharged thirty residents, often without proper\n13\nplanning and provision of the services needed to meet their individual needs.\n14\n4.158.  The defendants have also discharged residents to general nursing facilities during the past\n15\nfive  years.  Nursing facilities  are considered by professionals  and federal  regulators to be totally\n16\ninappropriate settings for persons with developmental disabilities, since they do not provide the active\n17\ntreatment or habilitation services needed by persons with those disabilities.  The staffing  ratio in a\n18\ntypical nursing facility falls far short of the staffing needed to provide adequate care to persons with\n19\nsignificant developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors.\n20\n21 N. Needless Regression\n22 4.159.  Because of the conditions set forth in paragraphs 4.16-4.149 above, Rainier residents have\n23  suffered regression with respect to their individual skills and abilities.\n24 4.160.  Members of the plaintiff class who were in good health now have serious, even life-\n25 threatening health problems, including damaged lungs and difficulties with breathing and digestion.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 54  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.161.  Due to the numbing effect of idleness and the institution's barren environment, many class\nplaintiffs have lost cognitive skills, the ability to relate to others and to respond to their environment.\nOther class plaintiffs have lost the ability to speak and communicate. From being denied the opportunity\nto engage in the activities of daily living, many class plaintiffs have lost those skills altogether.\n4.162.  Custodial facilities  like Rainier inherently deny the class plaintiffs  the  experiences,\n6 interactions, and opportunities for growth and development that other members of society enjoy.\n4.163.  By segregating individuals they perceive as having significant disabilities from the rest of\n8 the community and isolating them at Rainier with others who are disabled, defendants emphasize their\n\"difference\" from the rest of society, stigmatizing them for life.\n10 4.164.  Individuals who are perceived as having significant disabilities, like other persons, vary\n11 in their needs, wishes, and abilities. At different points of life, different activities and environments are\n12 appropriate to each person. The environment of Rainier is designed for a single purpose — for custodial\n13 care  and  mass  management  of persons with severe disabilities.  Plaintiffs'  confinement  in  this\n14 environment deprives them of their individuality, the possibility of habilitation, and of living freely.\n15 4.165.  In  an  environment  designed  for  mass  management  of  large  numbers  of  residents,\n16 individuals who are perceived as having significant disabilities cannot receive the consistent individual\n17 attention they need to grow, develop, and avoid regression. Persons who cannot communicate in words\n18 need attention from others  who know them well and understand their method of communication.  Far\n19 more than those who can speak articulately and whose disabilities are less severe, people with severe\n20 disabilities and those who cannot speak need close personal attention that they can receive only in a\n21 family-scale setting.\n22 4.166.  Individuals with complex needs fare the least well in large congregate settings. The more\n23 complex the individual's needs, the smaller the setting must be, to enable staff to focus on and provide\n24 consistent attention to the individual.\n25 4.167.  A congregate care facility like Rainier is not a natural environment.  It is an artificial\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 55  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nenvironment in which persons with intellectual disabilities cannot learn real life skills or functional\nactivities.  In such an environment, persons with developmental disabilities cannot receive what their\nspecific learning needs require: the opportunity to learn real-life skills in the environments where those\nskills are practiced.\n4.168.  Congregate care facilities, particularly where there are ten or more residents, are dangerous\nbecause of a high risk that a resident will lose her own sense of personal identity and the reinforcing and\nstimulating aspects of direct handling in a stable and family-like atmosphere.\n8 4.169.  The threat of abuse of individuals with disabilities is increased in an institutional setting\nbecause the institution congregates a large number of people with dependent needs.\n10 4.170.  Individuals with challenging behaviors need \"models\" ~ persons without maladaptive\n11 behaviors. When individuals with challenging behaviors are congregated together, as they are at Rainier,\n12 there is an enhanced risk of learning maladaptive behaviors from the inappropriate behavior of others.\n13 4.171.  The size and scale of Rainier is an impediment to the consistent, effective delivery of\n14 therapeutic activities and services.  In a large setting, many more staff must be trained in consumers'\n15 therapy and management programs than would be the case in a smaller setting.\n16 4.172.  Maintenance of employee resolve and standards is much more complicated at a congregate\n17 care facility like Rainier than at a small program.  Holding staff accountable to deliver residents' IPP\n18 programs is difficult in a large facility.  The complexity of the institutional bureaucracy and the lack\n19 of staff accountability in a large congregate environment makes it difficult to get the simplest things\n20 done.\n21 4.173.  Recruiting qualified  professional  staff to work at places like Rainier is tremendously\n22 difficult.  This is due not only to the low pay but to the administrative barriers that staff must overcome\n23 to work efficiently in that environment.\n24 4.174.  Because so many persons with complex disabilities are congregated together at Rainier,\n25 their needs overwhelm the staff.  Congregating a large number of persons with complex needs greatly\n26\nClass Action Complaint •  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 56  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nincreases the difficulty for staff of finding activities that are interesting, stimulating or meaningful for\nthe residents. Conversely, however, when persons with significant disabilities spend time with persons\nwithout disabilities, each non-disabled person serves as a natural teacher, and opportunities for learning\nare multiplied.\n4.175.  The opportunity to share places with individuals who are not labeled \"retarded\" cannot be\nprovided to people with disabilities in institutions; it can only be provided in communities. The\nopportunities and benefits of being around other people who do not have disabilities, including the\nbenefits  of modeling and learning personal and community living skills, the opportunity to  form\nfriendships with people who do not have disabilities, and the opportunity to gain the respect of members\n10 of the community, are not available in institutions.\n11 4.176.  No matter how large the ratio of staff to clients in a large congregate care setting, such a\n12 facility can never achieve the same favorable results as a normal home with support. Increasing the ratio\n13 of staff to clients will only lead to a point of diminishing returns, at which one additional  staff member\n14 will not result in any additional interaction with the people who live there. However, when only one\n15 staff person works with a very small number of residents, the quality of staff interaction with residents\n16 improves greatly.\n17\nO. Ineffectiveness of Institutionalization\n18\n4.177.  Rainier  embodies  the  \"medical\"  or  \"deficit\"  model  of  services  to  persons  with\n19\ndevelopmental disabilities. The \"medical model\" was a paradigm or framework for providing services\n20\nto people with disabilities that was current when most state institutions were built, but it is now obsolete.\n21\nThat model was based on the premise that a person with a developmental disability should be placed in\n22\na special setting whose purpose was to \"treat\" her or his disability or deficit.  An aspect of the medical\n23\nmodel is the concept of the \"continuum of care,\" that is, a continuum of residential settings from the\n24\nmost restrictive to the least restrictive, from the most heavily staffed  to the least heavily  staffed.\n25\nAccording to the \"medical model,\" a person was expected to move through the various stages of the\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 57  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\ncontinuum—from a state institution to a nursing home or large ICF/MR, to a small ICF/MR, to a group\nhome, to a semi-independent living arrangement and finally to a home of one's own -- as she or he\n\"improved\" and met the exit criteria for each setting.  According to this concept, people could move\nfrom a restrictive congregate setting such as Rainier only by demonstrating their \"readiness\" for the next\nlevel of the continuum.  In vocational services, the medical model dictated that the person earned his\nway along a similar \"continuum of care\": from a day activity center to a work activity center to sheltered\nwork and eventually to a real job only when her or his skills improved.\n8 4.178.  Research  and  experience have shown conclusively  that the medical  model  and  the\ncontinuum of care are unnecessary and highly unsuccessful in preparing persons with developmental\n10 II disabilities to live and work in more integrated and normal settings.\n11  4.179.  Research and experience have shown that institutions are not needed to serve persons with\n12 developmental disabilities, including persons with complex needs such as challenging behaviors or\n13 serious medical problems; that everyone can live in the community; and that people with developmental\n14 disabilities are better off in integrated community settings than in large congregate settings based on the\n15 \"deficit\" model.\n16 4.180.  Other states have reduced their admissions to state institutions to zero, demonstrating\n17 conclusively that the institutional model and the continuum of care are unnecessary.  Other states serve\n18 people with disabilities as severe as those of the residents of Rainier in home and community-based\n19 settings.  Still other states have concluded explicitly that they do not need state mental retardation\n20 institutions. The District of Columbia, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont have closed\n21  their state institutions.  Other states, including Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and\n22 Wyoming, have explicit or implicit plans to close all of their state institutions within the next five years.\n23 4.181.  No services are provided at Rainier that cannot feasibly be made available to class plaintiffs\n24 in the community, and particularly for those class members with severe disabilities, complex medical\n25 needs, and challenging behaviors. To the contrary, critically-needed services such as physical therapy,\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 58  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nspeech-language therapy, assistive technology, vocational training, and behavioral support management\nare provided inadequately and sporadically at Rainier, or not at all. In the community, the professional\nservices that the members of the plaintiff class need are widely available.\n4.182.  In a family-scale residence, it is easy for staff to become familiar with an individual's needs\nin a way that staff at Rainier cannot.\n4.183.  The defendants' failure to make residential services available to class plaintiffs with serious\nmedical needs is irrational since in Washington, as in other states all over the country, children with\ncomplex medical needs — children who are technology dependent, ventilator dependent, or have\ncatheterization tubes — are living at home with their families with support services funded by Medicaid,\n10 maternal health demonstration grants and the Washington Medicaid waiver program.  Adults with\n11 serious medical needs live in their own homes with support services provided by home health care\n12 agencies and other support services. The vast majority of Washington's citizens with serious medical\n13 needs do not go to institutions to receive their medical, therapeutic, or educational services.  They\n14  receive those services in their own homes and communities.\n15  4.184.  The intent of Congress, in amending the Social Security Act in 1971 to allow states to use\n16 Title XIX funds to pay for services in Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR),\n17 was to support \"[t]he active provision of rehabilitative, educational and training services to enhance\n18  the capacity of mentally retarded individuals to care for themselves or to engage in employment.\"  117\n19  Cong. Rec. 44720 (December 4,1971).  The unintended consequence of the use of ICR/MR funds by\n20  state officials, including the defendants, is that most ICF/MR dollars have flowed to large, custodial\n21  institutions like Rainier where little habilitation, education, and training take place.\n22  4.185.  Under the federal ICF/MR program, federal funds pay for fifty-two percent of the cost of\n23  care at Rainier. The ICF/MR program in effect gives states a right to draw against an open-ended federal\n24  bank account for their state institutions as long as the state's own surveyors continue to certify those\n25 facilities.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 59  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.186.  The State of Washington is highly dependent upon the ICF/MR funding  stream, not\nbecause of the professional judgment that persons with developmental disabilities are appropriately\nserved in an ICR/MR facility, but because the ICF/MR program provides the most secure, stable, and\npredictable  form  of  federal  financial  assistance  to  states  for  service  delivery  to  persons  with\ndevelopmental disabilities.  Defendants'  discriminatory and inappropriate use of ICF/MR funds to\nsustain its large, custodial state institutions inhibits and slows the growth and creation of alternative\ncommunity-based services for persons with significant disabilities.\n8 4.187.  DSHS surveyors have an inherent conflict of interest when they survey a state facility such\nas Rainier.  The state has a strong fiscal interest in continued Medicaid reimbursement for services at\n10 Rainier, and that interest is jeopardized when surveyors find violations of the conditions for continued\n11 participation.\n12 4.188.  The defendants' ICF/MR survey process is inadequate. DSHS surveyors fail to ensure that\n13 Medicaid-certified facilities in Washington, including Rainier and other ICF/MRs, meet the minimum\n14 standards for certification for the receipt of Medicaid funds pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security\n15 Act. Under the Medicaid regulations, failure to meet all eight of the ICF/MR conditions for participation\n16 requires that the facility be decertified.  However, DSHS surveyors often ignore the myriad violations\n17 of the ICR/MR standards at Rainier and routinely certify the facility, even though deficiencies are so\n18 massive that a reasonable surveyor could not find the institution in compliance with all of the ICF/MR\n19 conditions for participation.\n20\nP. Integrated Community-Based Programs and Placements\n21\n4.189.  Professional judgment dictates that persons with significant disabilities be served in life\n22\npatterns that are integrated with and similar to those followed by other persons.  The overwhelming\n23\nmajority of developmental disability professionals, public agencies and service providers now reject the\n24\nmedical or deficit model and see their purpose as that of supporting people with significant disabilities\n25\nin normal, integrated residential and work settings. Professionals now believe that the task of the service\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 60  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nsystem is not to assign the persons to a facility based on a diagnosis, but to support people in homes they\nchoose themselves, where they can live with the people with whom they want to live. This paradigm\nshift from the \"medical model\" to the \"support model\" is reflected in the mission statements, goals and\nobjectives of all the major national organizations concerned with people with developmental disabilities,\nas well as the policies of the State of Washington and its executive and legislative branches.\n4.190.  The  longstanding  federal  policy toward  individuals with developmental  disabilities,\narticulated and enacted over the course of nearly three decades, is based on the values of independence,\nproductivity, and integration of citizens with disabilities.  This policy in turn mirrors the professional\nconsensus that the proper place for individuals with developmental disability is in normal homes,\nschools and workplaces, and not in segregated \"facility-based\" programs.\n4.191.  The defendants themselves have recognized that it is good for individuals with disabilities\nto live in the most normal setting possible.  They know that individuals with significant disabilities\nbenefit enormously from opportunities to practice daily living skills in normal environments, and to\nexercise choice and judgment in their lives.\n4.192.  The defendants have acknowledged and recognize that the most important concept shaping\nthe delivery of developmental disability services during the last decade included \"normalization\" and\n\"community  integration\" as formal  objectives  for  those state  agencies  administering  services  to\nindividuals with disabilities. \"Normalization\" is the principle that \"the 'treatment' of individuals with\nmental retardation and related conditions must recognize and reflect each individual's dignity as a\nperson, his or her natural membership in their native society and community, and his or her right to live\nas closely as possible in the manner of their culture.\" 'Community integration' is a concept \"reflecting\nthe value to people with developmental disabilities of sharing in community life\" that includes the\nfollowing key principles:\na.  Physical  Integration:  To be  a member  of  a community  one  must  live  in  that\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 61  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n1  valued lifestyles and roles;\n2  c.  Social Integration: To be a member of a community one must enjoy  reciprocal\ninterpersonal relationships with other community members; and\nd.  Self-Determination: To be a member of a community one must be able to affirm one's\n4 individuality through expressions of personal independence and preference within the\nlimits and according to the standards of the community.\n4.193.  The defendants,  as well as those professionals  who work at Rainier,  are in general\n6\nagreement that the residents of Rainier could successfully be placed in the community if provided with\n7\nadequate supports and services.  In particular, defendant Davis, the Director of DDD, has frequently\n8\nstated that the residents of Rainier could be served in the community if they were provided with\n9\nappropriate habilitation services and supports.\n10\n4.194.  Research, demonstrations, and practice have shown conclusively that individuals with\nII\ndevelopmental disabilities are better off in integrated community settings than in large congregate\n12\nsettings based on the \"deficit\" model. Individuals with developmental disabilities grow, gain skills, and\n13\novercome institution-imposed regression when provided with opportunities to learn and practice basic\n14\nskills in small, well-structured, supervised community settings.\n15\n4.195.  In the last twelve years a body of research has developed showing what happens to the\n16\nquality of life of individuals with developmental disabilities when they move from large congregate care\n17\nsettings to community living in small, family-scale homes.\n18\n4.196.  In a five-year study commissioned by the Secretary of the United States Department of\n19\nHealth  and Human  Services comparing the growth and development  of individuals  moved from\n20\nPennhurst, a large congregate institution in Pennsylvania structurally similar to Rainier, to family-scale\n21\ncommunity living arrangements, researchers monitoring residents for five years found that persons with\n22\nsevere disabilities placed in community living arrangements increased in skills and developmental\n23\ngrowth while residents of the institution did not. The federal government study concluded that persons\n24\nwho moved from Pennhurst to community placements were \"better off in every way.\" J.W. Conroy and\n25\nV.J. Bradley. The Pennhurst Longitudinal Studv: A Report of Five Years of Research and Analysis.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\n27\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 62  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nTemple Univ. Philadelphia, PA (1985). After the initial five-year study was competed, the authors of\nthe Pennhurst Longitudinal Study continued to follow the 1700 members of the Pennhurst class and\nfound significant continued gains in growth and well-being.\n4.197.  Similarly, a systematic longitudinal study on the progress of 1,350 members of the plaintiff\nclass in CARC v. Thome. No. H-78-653 (TEC) (D. Conn.), concluded that \"the people who have thus\nfar moved from congregate care to community settings are, on the average, much better off in every way\nwe know how to measure.\"  J.W. Conroy, fit al, 1990 Results of the CARC v. Thorne Longitudinal\nStudy (1991) (emphasis in original).\n4.198.  These and other systematic studies of what happens to institutional residents when they\n10 move to the community have found:\n11 a.  When former institutional residents are placed in the community, they make highly\nsignificant gains in skills and development (adaptive behavior);\n12\nb.  Former institutional residents who move to the community make significantly greater\n13 gains in adaptive behavior than those individuals with comparable needs who remain at\nthe institution;\n14\nc.  When people who are labeled severely or profoundly retarded move into family-like\n15 community settings, they show even greater gains, proportionally, in adaptive behavior\nthan persons labeled mildly and moderately retarded. No support exists for the proposition\n16 that some people are \"too low functioning\" to succeed in the community;\n17 d.  Although the initial gains in adaptive behavior following class members' placement\nin the community are generally the most dramatic, the gains do not level off but continue.\n18 Former institutional residents continue to make significant gains in the community;\n19 e.  Former institutional residents make significant  gains in reducing challenging or\nmaladaptive behavior after they are placed in the community;\n20\nf .  An inverse relationship exists between the size of a residential setting and the degree\n21  of community integration of its residents;\n22  g.  Former  institutional  residents  generally  receive  more  hours  of  service  in  the\ncommunity than they received at the institution; and\n23\nh.  Before  community  placement,  the  majority  of  families  of  former  institutional\n24 residents are strongly opposed to community placement of their relatives. However, after\ncommunity placement, this pattern is completely reversed: the majority of family members\n25 become strongly supportive of community placement.\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 63  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\n4.199.  The experience of properly planned institutional closures in other states demonstrates that\nvirtually  all residents of state institutions can live in small, integrated residential  settings in the\ncommunity, and that closure can be accomplished without adverse effects to institutional residents.\n4.200.  The issue of whether individuals with developmental disabilities are better off in family-\nscale, integrated settings than in large congregate settings (settings with more than fifteen residents) is\nno longer an issue for scholars and professionals in the  field.  There is a strong consensus among\nscholars who have studied the relation between size and quality of care that family-scale residences are\n8 better than institutions for individuals with developmental disabilities in every way that is measurable.\n9\nO. Discriminatory Exclusion from Community-Based Services\n10\n4.201.  The  defendants  refuse  to refer  many members  of the plaintiff  class for  community\n11\nplacement because they perceive them as having severe disabilities, complex medical conditions, or\n12\nchallenging behaviors.  Professional recommendations for community placement cannot be made or\n13\nacted upon because of the unavailability of community services for those members of the plaintiff class.\n14\n4.202.  The State of Washington's mental retardation and developmental disabilities program\n15\nembodies the obsolete \"medical model.\"  It is characterized by a system of \"levels\" of residential\n16\nfacilities from the large and most heavily staffed institutions, such as Rainier, to the smallest and least\n17\nheavily staffed residential facilities, such as typical homes, duplexes, or apartments where residents live\n18\nsemi-independently.  This system is a substantial departure from the current professional consensus in\n19\nthe field. By continuing to operate this system, the defendants intentionally discriminate against those\n20\nindividuals who are perceived as having severe developmental disabilities, complex medical conditions,\n21\nor challenging behaviors.\n22\n4.203.  The defendants have failed to prevent their community-based residential service providers\n23\nfrom  discriminating  against those  plaintiff  class members  who  are perceived  as  having  severe\n24\ndevelopmental disabilities, complex medical conditions, or challenging behaviors.  Defendants have\n25\nfailed to provide funding on a per diem basis for community-based services that is non-discriminatory\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\n28\nPage - 64  Telephone: (206) 324-1521 /Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\nand equitable in comparison to the funding  available to the state's institutions, including Rainier.  The\nservice system operated by defendants is characterized by absence of planning and lack of coordination\nbetween the separate agencies that share responsibility for serving individuals with developmental\ndisabilities.\n4.204.  The defendants, through DSHS, have applied for and received a waiver from the Health\nCare Financing Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services as\nprovided under Section 2176 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.  The Section 2176\n8 waiver allows Medicaid funds to be used to support a variety of non-institutional home and community-\nbased services for former ICF/MR residents or those who are at risk of ICF/MR placement.  To obtain\n10 a waiver, the defendants must show the Health Care Financing Administration of the United States\n11 Department of Health and Human Services that they will use the waiver to close ICF/MR beds or refrain\n12 from opening new ones. The wavier provides the same federal match — fifty-two cents for every forty-\n13 eight cents — that the defendants receive for services at Rainier.  Effective use of the federal Medicaid\n14 Waiver Program would enable Washington to provide integrated services to persons currently residing\n15 at Rainier at no greater expense to the state treasury.\n16 4.205.  The defendants have failed to use the waiver program to provide home and community-\n17 based services for Rainier residents with the most significant disabilities. If community programs were\n18 funded at the same level as Rainier, community providers could develop services for everyone.\n19 4.206.  The defendants  do not plan for services based on the identified  needs of individual\n20 residents. Many of the class plaintiffs are placed at Rainier because institutional beds are available, not\n21 because that service meets their individual needs.\n22 4.207.  The  defendants  have  chosen  to  allocate  the  majority  of  their  fiscal  resources  for\n23 developmental  disabilities  services to the  state's  institutions.  This  is  a political, rather  than  a\n24 professional, decision.  Class plaintiffs are denied community services, not because of the professional\n25 judgment that they should be institutionalized, but because the distribution of resources is skewed\n26\nClass Action Complaint -  Washington Protection & Advocacy System\n27\nCivil Rights  1401 East Jefferson Street, Suite 506\nSeattle, Washington 98370\nPage - 65  Telephone: (206) 324-1521/Facsimile: (206) 324-1783\n\ntoward the state's institutions.\n4.208.  In their actions and inactions recited above, the defendants have failed to exercise proper\nprofessional judgment.  Defendants'  actions and inactions are such a substantial  departure  from\nprofessional judgment and current standards and practices as to demonstrate that they actually did not\nbase their decisions on professional judgment.\n4.209.  In their actions and inactions recited above, the defendants have acquiesced, with deliberate\nindifference, in a policy and practice of failing to adequately train their employees and in other policies,\n8 practices, customs and usages that are likely to result and have resulted in the violation of the class\nplaintiffs' constitutional rights.\n10 4.210.  The actions and inactions of the defendants that are recited above have resulted and will\n11 continue to result in harm, injury, and regression to the class plaintiffs.\n12 4.211.  The class plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy at law.\n13\n14 Claims\n15 Count I: Americans With Disabilities Act\n16 5.1.  The ADA contains four substantive titles that address discrimination in the areas of\n17 employment, public services, public accommodations, and telecommunications. Plaintiffs have brought\n18 this action, in relevant part, pursuant to Title II of the ADA.\n19 5.2.

The overwhelming majority of developmental disability\nprofessionals, public agencies and service providers now see their purpose as that of supporting\npeople with significant disabilities in normal, integrated residential and work settings. Professional\nand scholarly research clearly shows that individuals with developmental disabilities are better off in\nfamily-scale, integrated settings than in large institutions.\nProfessionals now believe that the task of the service system is not to assign the persons to a facility\nbased on a diagnosis, but to support people in homes they choose themselves, where they can Uve\nwith the people with whom they want to live. This paradigm shift from the \"medical model\" to the\n\"individual support model\" is reflected in the mission statements, goals and objectives of all the major\nnational organizations concerned with people with developmental disabilities, as well as the policies\nof the state of Washington and its executive and legislative branches.\nIndividuals with significant disabilities benefit enormously from opportunities to practice daily living\nskills in normal environments, and to exercise choice and judgment in their lives. The most important\nconcepts shaping the delivery of developmental disability services during the last decade included\n\"normalization\"  and \"community  integration\"  as formal  objectives  for those  state  agencies\nadministering services to individuals with disabilities.\nNormalization is the principle that \"the 'treatment' of individuals with mental retardation and related\nconditions must recognize and reflect  each individual's dignity as a person, his or her natural\nmembership in their native society and community, and his or her right to live as closely as possible\nin the manner of their culture.\"\nCommunity integration is a concept \"reflecting the value to people with developmental disabiUties\nof sharing in community life\" that includes the following key principles:\nTelephone (Voice) Facsimile Electronic Mail Telephone (TDD)\n(206)324-1521 (206)324-1783 wpas@halcyon.com (206)720-0209\n(800)562-2702 toll-free (800)905-0209 toll-free\ninterpreters  Available Promoting Dignity, Equality\nand Self-Determination\n\n•  When  former  institutional residents are placed in the community, they make highly\nsignificant gains in skills and development (adaptive behavior);\n•  Former institutional residents who move to the community make significantly  greater\ngains in adaptive behavior than those individuals with comparable needs who remain at\nthe institution;\n•  When people who are labeled severely or profoundly retarded move into  family-like\ncommunity settings, they show even greater gains, proportionally, in adaptive behavior\nthan  persons  labeled  mildly  and  moderately  retarded.  No  support  exists  for  the\nproposition that some people are \"too low functioning\" to succeed in the community;\n•  Although the initial gains in adaptive behavior following class members' placement in the\ncommunity are generally the most dramatic, the gains do not level off but continue.\nFormer institutional residents continue to make significant gains in the community;\n•  Former  institutional  residents  make  significant  gains  in  reducing  challenging  or\nmaladaptive behavior after they are placed in the community;\n•  `  An inverse relationship exists between the size of a residential setting and the degree of\ncommunity integration of its residents;\n•  Former institutional residents generally receive more hours of service in the community\nthan they received at the institution; and\n•  Before community placement, the majority of families of former institutional residents are\nstrongly opposed to community placement of their relatives. However, after community\nplacement, this pattern is completely reversed: the majority of family members become\nstrongly supportive of community placement:\nThe experience of properly planned institutional closures in other states demonstrates that virtually\nall residents of state institutions can live in small, integrated residential settings in the community, and\nthat closure can be accomplished without adverse effects to institutional residents.\nThe issue of whether individuals with developmental disabilities are better off in  family-scale,\nintegrated settings than in large congregate settings (settings with more than 15 residents) is no longer\nan issue for scholars and professionals in the field. There is a strong consensus among scholars who\nhave studied the relation between size and quality of care that family-scale residences are better than\ninstitutions for individuals with developmental disabilities in every way that is measurable.\nThe Right Choice  Page 3",

      "text": "People First of Wash. v. Rainer RHC\nMR-WA-002-001\nPromoting Dignity, Equality\nand Self-Determination\nPeople First vs. Rainier RHC\nCase Summary  '\nThe Washington Protection and Advocacy System (WPAS) filed a major class action lawsuit\nconcerning dangerous conditions at Rainier School, the state's largest residential habilitation center\n(RHC) for people with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. According to the lawsuit,\nfiled  in federal  court October 21, Rainier residents are subjected to abuse, neglect, injury, and\ninappropriate physical and chemical restraint and the defendants have violated the rights of\nresidents under the following  laws: U.S. Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Social Security Act. One of the lawsuit's\ndemands is the transfer of many Rainier residents to appropriate community placements.  Similar\nlitigation in other states has resulted in the closure of institutions for people with developmental\ndisabilities. This lawsuit could have a dramatic impact on the lives of people with developmental\ndisabilities in Washington.\nPlaintiffs\nNamed as plaintiffs in People First vs. Rainier RHC are six individuals with developmental disabilities\nwho currently reside at Rainier and four organizations: People First of Washington, The Arc of\nWashington State, the Autism Society of Washington, and the Washington Protection and Advocacy\nSystem (WPAS).\nThe six individual plaintiffs are: James Campbell, who has lived at Rainier since 1983; Chris Olson,\nwho has lived at Rainier since 1970; Houston Williams, who has lived at Rainier since 1956; Peter\nBohnke, who has lived at Rainier since 1947; Dawn Lavery, who has lived at Rainier since 1973;\n&nd John Mann, who has lived at Rainier since 1947.\nPeople First of Washington, a nonprofit corporation, is a statewide solf-advocacy organization\ngoverned entirely by people with developmental disabilities. More than 1000 Washington citizens are\nmembers of People First through its 33 chapters and support groups.\nThe Arc of Washington State, a nonprofit corporation, is the state's oldest and largest membership\norganization for individuals with developmental disabilities, their families, friends, and persons\nproviding services to them. The Arc's membership includes individuals who are at risk of\ninstitutionalization at Rainier because of their developmental disabilities.  »\nThe Autism Society of Washington, a nonprofit corporation, is a local chapter of the Autism\nSociety of America, which provides advocacy, support, and education on issues affecting persons\nwith autism and their families and friends.  The Autism Society's members include individuals with\nautism and other similar disabilities, as well as their families and friends.\nWashington Protection & Advocacy System\nA member of the National Association of Protection & Advocacy Systems\nFacsimile  Telephone (Voice)  1401 East Jefferson, Suite 506  Telephone (TDD)  Electronic Mail\n(206)324-1783  (206)324-1521  Seattle, Washington 98122  (206)720-0209  wpas@halcyon.com\n(800) 562-2702 toll-free  (800) 905-0209 toll-free\nInterpreters Available\n\nThe Washington Protection and Advocacy System (WPAS), a nonprofit corporation, is\ndesignated by the Governor to protect and advocate for the legal and civil rights of people in\nWashington who have physical or mental disabilities. WPAS has the authority and responsibility to\npursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to protect and advocate for the rights of\nthose state citizens who are or who may be eligible for treatment, services or habilitation due to their\ndevelopmental, mental or physical disabilities.\nDefendants\nThe following are named as defendants in People First vs. Rainier RHC:  The Rainier Residential\nHabilitation Center, a state-owned and state-operated institution in Buckley, Washington; Michael\nLowry, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Washington; The Washington\nDepartment of Social and Health Services; Lyle Quasim, in his official capacity as the Secretary\nof the Washington Department of Social and Health Services; The Washington Division of\nDevelopmental Disabilities; Norm Davis, in his official capacity as the Director of the Washington\nDivision of Developmental Disabilities; Leanna Lamb, in her official capacity as the Superintendent\nof the Rainier Residential Habilitation Center; The Washington Office of Financial Management;\nand Gary Robinson, in his official capacity as the Acting Director of the Washington Office of\nFinancial Management.\nDescription of class\nThe class represented in the lawsuit consists of all persons who: (1) presently reside at Rainier, (2)\nmay be admitted or are at risk of being admitted to Rainier; or (3) have been discharged from Rainier\nto group homes, nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with mental retardation\nand developmental disabilities, and other community living arrangements funded, operated, or\nlicensed by the defendants after October 1, 1991, and at risk of reinstitutionalization in the future due\nto inadequate supports and services. Approximately 459 individuals currently reside at Rainier.\nApproximately 30 individuals have been discharged from Rainier in the past 5 years. The number of\nclass members who may be admitted or are at risk of institutionalization at Rainier is not known at the\npresent time.\nPrimary Allegations\nPeople First vs. Rainier RHC includes, but is not limited to, the following allegations:\nHarmful Conditions: The conditions at Rainier are dangerous, and have caused and continue to\npose an immediate and great threat of harm to the individuals residing there. In addition, Rainier is a\nsegregated, inhumane and disrespectful environment.\nInadequate Basic Care: At Rainier, many of the plaintiffs' basic care needs are frequently ignored.\nFor example, residents are often left alone for hours, staff ratios in many units are inadequate to meet\nresidents' basic care and attendant support needs, and, due to the inadequate staffing, some of the\nstaff on duty commonly ignore their clients and leave residents unattended. In some cases, this\npractice has lead to serious injury and death.\nPeople First vs. Rainier RHC -  Page 2\n\nInadequate Medical Care: Many members of the plaintiff class do not receive adequate and timely\nmedical care or dental care. Medical staffing at Rainier is grossly inadequate. Residents' health\nproblems often go unrecognized and untreated. The one part-time psychiatrist at Rainier is completely\ninadequate to supervise and monitor the care of the hundreds of Rainier residents who receive\npsychoactive medications or require intensive behavioral supports.\nExcessive Injury and Abuse: Residents' safety at Rainier is constantly at risk.  The rate of injury is\nalarmingly high. Many of the injuries are of unknown cause and weie unobserved at the time they\noccurred. The defendants do not make reasonable professional attempts to prevent injuries. Verbal\nabuse of residents is widespread at Rainier and neglect of residents is common.\nInadequate Habilitation and Training: Habilitation is the teaching and training process required by\npersons with significant disabilities so that they can reach their fullest potential in physical, social and\nmental growth. The amount of habilitation services offered to class members at Rainier is grossly\ninadequate to meet their individual needs or to qualify as active treatment. Habilitation at Rainier does\nnot lead to greater independence, productivity and integration. The quality of life of persons at\nRainier is unacceptable because it offers no opportunity for progress, participation in valued life\nactivities, daily lifestyle choices, privacy, safety, or dignity.\nInadequate Behavior Management: Appropriate behavior management programs and supports are\nimportant components of habilitation and active treatment.  However, at Rainier, programs to deal\nwith plaintiffs' behavioral problems are seriously deficient.  As a result, physical and chemical\nrestraints are used as a substitute for appropriate care and programs, with the consequence that\nresidents' behavioral problems are exacerbated and escalate.\nInadequate Discharge Planning: Post-discharge planning and follow-along services at Rainier are\ninadequate.  Several Rainier residents have been discharged from the institution without adequate\neffort to assure that they will receive the proper support in an alternative community-based setting.\nAs a result, these Rainier residents who have been discharged are at risk of harm and of readmission\nto Rainier. During the past five years, Rainier has discharged thirty residents, often without proper\nplanning and provision of the services needed to meet their individual needs.\nNeedless Regression: Rainier residents have suffered regression with respect to their individual skills\nand abilities. Members of the plaintiff class who were in good health now have serious, even life-\nthreatening health problems, including damaged lungs and difficulties with breathing and digestion.\nDue to the numbing effect of idleness and the institution's barren environment, many class plaintiffs\nhave lost cognitive skills, the ability to relate to others and to respond to their environment. Other\nclass plaintiffs have lost the ability to speak and communicate.\nDiscriminatory Exclusion from Community-Based Services: The defendants refuse to refer many\nmembers of the plaintiff class for community placement. Although community services are not more\nexpensive, the defendants have chosen to allocate the majority of their fiscal resources for\ndevelopmental disability services to the institutions. Many of the class plaintiffs are placed at Rainier\nbecause beds are available, not because that service meets their individual needs.\nPeople First vs. Rainier RHC — Page 3\n\nDemands\nThe primary goal of People First vs. Rainier RHC is to change harmful conditions at Rainier and\nallow residents to be transferred to community placements.  Specific demands include the following:\n•  To establish a system to prevent abuse and neglect of Rainier residents, to thoroughly and\npromptly investigate allegations of abuse and neglect and to establish appropriate\nconsequences for abuse and neglect of residents by Rainier staff.\nTo arrange for independent evaluation, by qualified professionals not employed by the state,\nof the individual habilitation and treatment needs of each plaintiff class member to determine\nwhether adequate treatment is being provided and whether any injuries have resulted from\ninadequate treatment at Rainier,\nTo hire sufficient numbers of professional and direct care staff at Rainier, including sufficient\nnumbers of qualified physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and\nlanguage pathologists, psychologists, and aides;\n•  To develop and provide adequate training programs for professional and direct care staff at\nRainier, and assure that all staff are able to demonstrate the skills and competencies to provide\nactive treatment to the class members they serve;\n•  To cease admitting individuals to Rainier or from transferring present residents from Rainier\nunless such transfer is to the most integrated community setting appropriate to their needs,\nand appropriate developmental disability services are provided to them;\nThe State Legislature's Conclusions on Community Placement\nIn 1992, the state Legislative Budget Committee (LBC) conducted an extensive investigation on the\nissue of moving people with developmental disabilities out of institutions and into the community.\nThe LBC concluded that individuals in the state's developmental disability institutions and community\nresidential programs and services, generally speaking, were not distinct in terms of problem behaviors,\ndaily living skills, and needed services and supports. Their findings, distributed in early 1993,\nincluded the following:\n•  Many of the current residents at state institutions could be supported successfully in home and\ncommunity-based placements;\n•  Placement in home and community-based settings is most conducive to personal growth and\nindependence, and is generally more cost-effective than institutional care; and\n•  Services provided in both community and institutional settings should be designed to promote\nthe acquisition of independent living skills and self-sufficiency.\nPeople First vs. Rainier RHC — Page 4",
