    "summary": "<p>On March 1, 1985, a class of juveniles confined at juvenile detention centers operated by the District of Columbia (\"the District\") filed a lawsuit against the District under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. They alleged unconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation of the juveniles' Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. Plaintiffs specifically challenged the conditions of confinement at Cedar Knoll Youth Center and Oak Hill Youth Center, both in Laurel, Maryland, alleging that the facilities at Cedar Knoll were unfit for habitation and that rehabilitative services, including educational and vocational training services, mental health and medical services, and social and recreational services, were unconstitutionally and statutorily inadequate at both Centers. The complaint further alleged that a climate of violence existed at both Centers, and that policies concerning attorney-client communication and family visitation at both Centers violated the juveniles' rights. The plaintiffs, represented by the Public Defender Service and the ACLU National Prison Project, sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>On July 24, 1986, the Superior Court (Honorable Ricardo M. Urbina) approved and entered a consent decree (\"the Decree\"). The consent decree established a panel of three experts to determine the correct number of juveniles in the District in need of secure confinement, and develop a system for appropriate care of these juveniles. The Decree established procedural rules for staff discipline and training, recordkeeping, and discipline of juveniles; set forth detailed requirements for diagnostic procedures, cottage life, recreational, mental health, and social services, as well as education and vocational training programs; and required the District to submit a plan and timetable for resolving environmental health and safety concerns.</p>\r\n<p>The Clearinghouse only has appellate decisions describing subsequent litigation, but it is clear that extensive litigation over the scope of the Decree followed. Following the panel's submission of a plan to the court, and the court's orders pursuant to this plan, the District appealed. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals (Chief Judge Rogers) found that the trial judge had exceeded his authority under the scope of the decree in certain respects. 571 A.2d 178 (D.C. Ct. App. 1990). The court of appeals did, however, find that the trial judge had not erred in finding that the District had \"failed to meet its basic commitment under the Decree,\" and in imposing sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 1990, the D.C. Court of Appeals (Judge Farrell) affirmed the lower court's ruling that plaintiffs' attorneys could be awarded fees for their work enforcing the Decree, but remanded the issue to the trial court because it had failed to adequately explain its reasoning as to the amount of fees awarded. 580 A.2d 1270 (D.C. Ct. App. 1990). Attorney's fees litigation continued over several years. In 1996, the plaintiffs' attorney submitted a bill for work done during the months of April, May, and June, 1996. Defendants contested, arguing that fees for any work done after passage of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") were subject to the PLRA fee cap. The District Court (Judge Richard A. Levie) held that the PLRA did not apply to juvenile facilities, but on September 3, 1998, the D.C. Court of Appeals (Judge Schwelb) reversed, holding that the PLRA's limitation on attorney fee awards did apply to attorneys whose clients were confined juveniles and that the fee cap did not violate due process. 717 A.2d 866 (D.C. 1998).</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on June 24, 1997, the D.C. Superior Court appointed a Special Master to assist the defendants \"in identifying and correcting deficiencies in the provision of educational services required by the Consent Decree,\" because the defendants had repeatedly failed to bring the educational systems at the Centers into compliance with the Decree. In August 1998, the Special Master expressed concern over \"certain personnel, resource, and training issues\" at the Oak Hill Center, and the trial court appointed a receiver \"to assume, ultimate control over the education system at Oak Hill.'\" The District appealed, and the D.C. Court of Appeals (per curiam) held that, while the District had not fully complied with the Decree, there was not a sufficient basis for the imposition of such an extraordinary remedy. 738 A.2d 1206 (D.C. 1999). On May 15, 2000, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. 529 U.S. 1118 (2000).</p>\r\n<p>The consent decree remained in effect for several subsequent decades. In 2015, the parties settled part of the case and agreed that the court would have less oversight responsibility going forward.</p>\r\n<p>On February 5, 2020, the parties settled the remainder of the case and agreed to end the consent decree. The District pointed to various improvements it had made over the years, such as establishing a Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, closing facilities (including Oak Hill) and opening new facilities, adding medical and behavioral health services, education, and other rehabilitative resources, and making facilities safer. The settlement required the District to create an Office of Independent Juvenile Justice Facilities Oversight (OIJJFO), which would make sure that the District was still meeting the goals of the consent decree. The court approved this settlement later that year, and the consent decree was terminated.</p>\r\n<p>The OIJJFO was created in 2021, and the settlement mandated that it operate for at least three years. In November 2023, the District decided to fund the OIJJFO until at least September 2024. Subsequent news reports indicated that the OIJJFO would be funded through 2025 as well. These extensions of the OIJJFO occurred after allegations about dangerous conditions within the District's youth facilities, including staffing shortages, excessive confinement, sexual assault, and violent fights.&nbsp;</p>",

The District did not comply and the Court granted receivership, but the decision was remanded for consideration of factors mentioned by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

No. 1519-65 (IFP)\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al.,  )\nDefendants. )\nCONSENT DECREE^\nBy agreement of the parties, the following consent decree is\nsubmitted for approval by the Court to resolve the issues in C.A.\nNo.  1519-65.  The  parties  agree  to  the  provisions  set  forth\nbelow:\nI.  POPULATION AND FACILITIES\nA.  General Principles\n1.  The parties recognize and acknowledge the right of\nchildren  to  be  housed  and  provided  services  in  the  least\nrestrictive setting consistent with the protection of the public,\nthe youth's  individual  needs  and with  applicable  court  rules,\nstatutory and constitutional provisions.\n2.  The parties recognize the right of a child not to\nbe confined in any District nf Columbia secjjre juvenile facility\nif that child is capable of functioning safejly by himself or with\nthe responsible assistance of others, without  serious danger to\nhimself or others, in a community-based program.\n3.  The parties recognize and acknowledge that it is in\nthe  best  interest  of  children  to  remain  in  secure  pretrial\ndetention for as short a time as possible but not to exceed any\nperiod  longer  than  (30)  days  or,  in  the  case  of  a pretrial\nshelter house placement, any period longer than  (45) days.  The\nparties further recognize that it is not In any party's interest\nfor more detention slots to be created solely because of pretrL&l\ndetention periods exceeding  these periods; the parties  further\nrecognize that the presence of children in pretrial detention for\n\n-2-\npeciods longer  than  that set  forth above because of delays in\ncourt proceedings, a footer which, in many cases, is beyond the\ndefendants' control,  creates  a  need  for  a  greater  number  of\ndetention slots, including in the community, than that which the\ndefendants should be required to provide.\nB.  The plaintiffs and defendants agree that an assessment\nand study of the juvenile population in the existing YSA juvenile\nfacilities  will  be  done  in order  to determine  an  appropriate\nconfiguration and design for the confinement of children in the\ncustody  of YSA.  The parties  further  agree  that  the  juvenile\npopulation  confined  to  secure  beds  in  the District  should  be\nreduced  to the lowest number possible pursuant to those general\nprinciples  set  forth  in Section A above.  The  defendants  are\ncommitted  to and  shall take all reasonable action within their\nauthority  to reduce  the population of the secure  facilities to\nthe  lowest  number  possible.  In  order  to  determine  the\nappropriate number of juveniles in need of secure confinement in\nthe  District  and  to  develop  a  system  for  appropriate  care,\nservices, and  placement  of securely  confined  juveniles  in YSA\ncustody, the following mechanism shall be implemented:\n1.  A panel  of  three experts, selected  as follows by\nthe parties, shall be convened as soon as possible from the date\nt\nof  the signing  of  this Decree by the parties.  Plaintiffs and\ndefendants  each  shall  select  one member  of  the panel and  the\nplaintiffs and defendants shall agree upon the third member.  The\nfollowing  persons  have  been  designated  to  constitute  this\npanel:  Paul DeMuro (designated by the plaintiffs)}\n(designated by the defendants)} and Margaret Beyer\n(mutually selected by plaintiffs and defendants).  Jerome Miller\n•hall  be  a  non-voting  consultant  to  the  panel, and  will  be\ncompensated  for his services out of the panel's budget.  If for\nsome  reason  a  panel  member  cannot  continue  to  aerve  in this\ncapacity,  the  successor  panel member  shall be selected  in the\nsame manner as his/her  predecessor.  If, after  two weeks from\nreceiving notice that the mutually selected panel member intends\nto resign, the parties can not agree on a successor  for that\n\n-4-\nconfinement  slots  per  facility  as  determined  by  the\n*  panel), such as pre-release housing or therapeutic unit\nhousing;\nc)  establish standards and procedures as well as\na  mechanism  for  the  on-going  review  and  community\nplacement  of  all  detained  and  committed  children\nconfined  in YSA custody.  At a minimum, such children\nshall be reviewed by defendants every 30 days (unless a\ndifferent  time  frame  is  otherwise  determined  by  the\npanel), to assess whether children are being confined in\nthe most appropriate and least restrictive setting.\n3.  Within 3 months of the provisional approval of this\nDecree  by  the Court, the panel  shall compile  the findings and\nplans required under Section B(2) above, in a draft plan to be\nsubmitted  to  the  parties,  who, within  twenty-five  (25) days,\nshall submit their views to the panel.  Within twelve (12) days,\nthe  panel, after  review  and  due consideration  of  the parties'\nview, may modify the findings and the plan and shall submit this\ndraft plan to the parties.  The parties then shall have ten (10)\ndays to submit any further views to the panel, which must within\nten (10) days review and consider these further comments.  At the\nend of this ten (10) day review, the panel shall then submit.its\nfinal plan to the Court.  Unless objections to the plan by either\nparty  are  submitted  to the Court  within  twelve  (12) days, the\nplan shall be reviewed and, upon approval by the Court, shall be\nincorporated  herein by reference.  In the event of objections,\nthe Court may hold a hearing and resolve the natter pursuant to\nthe principles in Section A above.  The parties will not seek a\n•tay of, or appeal from, those portions of the order affirming\n.the panel's plan except that* neither party waives the right, if\nany exists, to seek a stay of or appeal from those portions of\nthe order which modify the final plan submitted to the Court by\nthe panel.  In the event of such appeal, the parties agree that\nno  portion  of  the  Decree  itself  nay  be  challenged.  This\nparagraph is not intended to impinge upon the court's prerogative\nto order youth into secure confinement.\n\n-3-\nmember,  then  the  two remaining  panel members  shall select  the\nthird member  of  the panel within  five days.  if at the ena of\nthis  period,  the  two  panel  members  can  not  agree  upon  that\nmember, then the matter is considered a substantial dispute to be\nsubmitted to the monitor for resolution.\n2.  In  accordance  with  the  time  frames  set  forth  In\nSection I(B)(3), the panel shall:\na)  determine  the  number  of  children  that  the\nDistrict of Columbia may confine in secure facilities in\naccordance with those principles set forth in Section A.\nabove.  This  determination  shall  be  based  upon  the\npanel's assessment of the current population within YSA\ncustody, including in the secure facilities; discussions\nwith  their  consultants,  if  necessary;  information  and\ndata about the D.C. juvenile justice process; interviews\nwith  pertinent  D.C. Government  employees, with  DHS/YSA\nstaff,  including  those  persons  whom  the  parties  may\nsuggest,  with  youth  in  YSA  custody,  With  the  Public\nDefender  Service, and  the Juvenile  Branch,  Corporation\nCounsel, and with representatives of the Superior Court\nFamily  Trial  Lawyers  Association?  and  any  other\ndocuments  and  sources deemed  appropriate by the panel.\nThe panel shall have access to all relevant records and\nfiles  and  access  to  all DRS/YSA  facilities  and  staff;\nand  access to D.C. Superior  Court officials and  staff,\nas available.\nb)  prepare a specific comprehensive plan for the\ndesign,  development,  and  implementation  of  community-\nbased  programming  and  alternatives  with  specific\nobjectives  and  time  tables  in  accordance  with  the\nprinciples set forth in Section A above.  The continuum\nof  alternatives'to  facility  confinement  shall  include\nbut not necessarily be limited  to group homes, shelter\nhouses,  foster  tare,  specialized  placements,  family\nsupport services, home detention service*, day treatment\nprograms, and any needed  tesidential construction of a\nnon-secure nature  (not to exceed a designated number of\n\n4.  By December  1, 1987, (unless the panel determines\nthat • different time frame is appropriate):  i) the number of\nchildren, who pursuant to I (B) (2) (a) the District of Columbia may\nconfine in secure facilities, will not exceed said number above;\nii)  the  system  of  community  based  alternatives  pursuant  to\nI(B)(2)(b) shall  be  established  and utilized.  Within  six  (6)\naonths of the provisional approval of this Decree by the Court,\nthe on-going review pursuant to I(B)(2)(c) to be devised by the\npanel, shall be implemented.  This paragraph is not intended to\nimpinge upon the court's prerogative to order youth into secure\nconfinement.\n5.  The panel  shall be maintained  for  24 months from\nthe time of the submission of its plan to the Court.  The panel\nshall  provide  recommendations  to  the  defendants  to  accomplish\n'  i\nfull  implementation  of  the Court  approved  pi art and  shall  also\nmonitor  the  progress  of  defendants'  compliance  by  submitting\nsemi-annual reports to the parties.  Once the panel is disbanded,\neither  party  herein  may  thereafter  request  that  the panel  be\nreconvened  to  reassess  whether  a  modification  of  the  plan\napproved  by  the  Court  as  to  the  number  of  children  who  the\nDistrict of Columbia may confine  in secure facilities should be\nrevised  following  the  procedures  set  forth  in Section  I(B)(3)\nabove.  in this regard, the panel shall submit a report to the\nparties, and thereafter  the Court, following the procedures set\nforth in Section I(B)(3) above.\n6.  The  panel  may  utilize  the  services  of  personnel\nwith  expertise  in  the  District  government  where  it  deems  it\nappropriate.  The District of Columbia shall compensate the panel\nfor reasonable costs and fees for the performance of the panel's\n, functions.  The panel shall, after consultation with counsel for\nthe parties, propose its budget.  If there ate no objections to\nthe budget, or if objections are resolved within ten (10) days,\nthe budget shall be accepted  and  incorporated  herein.  If the\npanel and the parties are unable to resolve a dispute concerning\nthe budget, such dispute shall be submitted to the monitor.  If\nthe matter still remains unresolved, the issue shall be submitted\nto the Court.\n\n7.  YSA on a aonthly basis shall review the StatUS Of\nall detained or committed children in YSA custody.  Where a child\nneeds less secure confinement, YSA shall make all reasonable and\nappropriate adjustments to the system pursuant to the principles\nset forth  in I (A) abovet  ^including  reassignment  of children by\nYSA  to  non-secure  custody,  and  notifying  and  requesting\nCorporation  Counsel*  Juvenile  Branch,  and  appropriate  defense\ncounsel  for youth  in YSA ^ustody to file motions with pertinent\njudges to transfer to less v ^ure settings, to lift restrictions,\nand to modify the level of detention or commitment as to specific\nyouth).  Accordingly,  YSA  sVall  have  available  at  all times a\npriority  listing  revised  on\\ a  monthly  basis  of  at  least  20\nsecurely  detained  and  20  securely  committed  children  who  are\nclosest  to release or most appropriate for being transferred out\nof secure confinement.

As to committed  youth, the mission of institution\nprograms  is  habilitation.  Youth  have  many  educational,\nemotional, vocational, familial, recreational  and social needs.\nThe  experience  of  success  is  central  to  the  habilitation\nprocess.  Youth must be offered opportunities  to be competent,\nhave  a  sense  of  self-worth,  and  be  accepted  by  adults  and\npeers.  Staff in all parts of the institution must work to create\na'positive milieu  in which youth succeed and fdrm constructive\nrelationships with adult and peers.\n2.  Youth are detained in YSA secure facilities by the\ncourt.  The goals of YSA for the securely detained are  (1) to\nprovide  a humane  environment  in which  short-term  educational,\nrecreational  and  emotional  needs  are  met;  (2)  to  prepare\nrecommendations on individual needs for disposition? and  (3) to\nmaintain  a child  and  to prevent  his deterioration  during  his\nperiod of detention.  The secure detention program must be short-\nterm and focused on preparing the youth for a more positive--next\nstep  in  his/her  life,  either  after  dismissal,  disposition  of\nprobation, or a disposition of commitment.\n3.  After 45 days of detention, each youth will receive\nservices and programs consistent with the goals set forth above\nfor  committed  youth  in  accord  with  his  Individual  Services\nPlan.\nB.  Diagnostic Services- for All Youth in YSA Institutions\n1.  Diagnostic Procedures\nAs of February 1, 1987, classification procedures\nwill be developed and implemented to:\n(a)  identify  the  least  restrictive  alternative\nplacement  to. «eet  the needs of each youth  end to protect  the\n\n-15-\npublic,  including  placement  in  community-based  programs  as\npermitted by the court and consistent with the principles in 1(A)\n(1) and  (2) above.\n(b)  specify  an  initial  screening  and  diagnostic\nprocess;\n(c)  define  how  youth  will be classified  based on.\nsocial,  psychological,  and  behavioral  needs  and  assigned  to\nhousing  units  according  to  treatment  needs  and  security\nconsiderations.\n(d)  enable the facility  to move youth to the next\nleast  restrictive  setting  when  youth  are  ready  to  move,  as\npermitted  by  the  court  and  consistent  with principles  in I  (A)\n(1) and  (2) above.  .  <\n—  Procedures will be developed  in compliance with the\nprovisions  of  the  ACA  Standards  for  Juvenile  Training  Schools\n(1983 ed.) pertaining  to classification  (2-9381 through 2-9399).\n2.  Diagnostic Dnlt\nAs  of  January  1,  1987,  there  will  be  a  unit\ndesignated  for  diagnostic  purposes.  As  of  February  1,  1987,\nwritten procedures will be developed  and implemented  to:\n(a)  limit the stay of youth on the diagnostic unit\nor within the diagnostic phase;\n(b)  prohibit  the  use  of  isolation  during -the\ndiagnostic  phase,  except  in  Individualized  cases  for\nmedical/psychiatric or disciplinary  reasons.\n(c)  ensure  that youth  in the diagnostic unit have\na structured daily program;\n(d)  ensure  that  youth  wear  appropriate  daytime\nclothing on the diagnostic unit.\n3.

Observation,  interviews,  information  from\nprevious  evaluations,  and  testing,  including  individualized\ntesting, are the ingredients of thorough assessment:  the goal of\nthe diagnostic unit is to develop as accurate picture as possible\nof  each  youth's  needs.  The diagnostic  process must  result in\nspecific  identification of needs and strengths which direct the\nservices  to be  delivered  to youth.  An  integrated  diagnostic\npackage  must  be  done  in  such  a  way  that  it  produces  an\nunderstandable needs and strengths list which can be used by the\nteam to develop the individual service plan.\n(b)  The  diagnostic  package  shall  include\npsychological,  educational,  vocational,  medical  and  family\nassessments.  These assessments must not be more than a year old,\nand may be repeated more frequently if the diagnosticians see the\nneed  to  do  so.

Assessments-must\nincorporate  the observations  of  cottage  staff,  probation, and\nothers who have worked with the youth previously.\n(c)  Educational assessments will identify academic\nneeds and strengths and learning problems to be addressed during\nconfinement and current  functioning  levels as well as vocational\ninterest  and  aptitude  utilizing  individualized  instruments and\naeasures.\n(d)  The educational  assessment  will be completed\nwithin 3 days of adminsion.  In the event a youth is suspected of\nbeing handicapped and in need of special education services under\nP.L.  94-142, he will be referred by the next working day after\nbis  assessment  and will  be  evaluated  by  the DCPS  eligibility\nteams within 20 days of his referral except that where there is\n\n-18-\ndiagnostic unit  (unless a longer diagnostic phase is needed for\nsn  Individual  and  justified  in  writing  In  his/her  temporary\nservice plan).  At  this, point, the Team Leader will convene a\nteam meeting to dejrelpjL_the Individual Service Plan (hereinafter\nISP),.

The class\nincludes (but is not limited to) children who are or will be\n; confined at Cedar Knoll Youth Center and those who are or will be\n:1 confined at Oak Hill Youth Center.  These children are confined\nj; under court orders of detention (pending trial or pending\ndisposition) pursuant to D.C. Code § 16-2313(b)(3), or under\ndispositional orders of commitment to the Department of Human\nServices pursuant to D.C. Code § 16-2320(c)(2).\nCedar Knoll Youth Center is a detention facility for\nchildren, operated by the District of Columbia, and located in\nLaurel, Maryland.  The resident population of Cedar Knoll\nfluctuates from approximately 70 to 100 youths.  Approximately\ntwo-fifths of the children incarcerated at Cedar Knoll are\ndetained pending trial or disposition; the rest are committed to\nthe Department of Human Services.  Cedar Knoll is an antiquated\n\"reform school\" whose buildings have become unfit for habitation\nand whose programs are grossly limited and wholly inadequate.\nThe children live in buildings that are insufficiently heated and\nventilated, are infested with vermin, and have gaping holes in\nwalls and ceilings.  Without meaningful rehabilitative services,\nthe residents are warehoused for months or years before being\nreturned to the community.  ,\n¦  The Oak Hill Youth Center is a maximum-security juvenile\n\\¦ detention facility operated by the District of Columbia, and als<\nl· ·\nlocated in Laurel, Maryland.  The population of Oak Hill\nV  Because the status of the Cedar Knoll School has been and\ncontinues to be in a state of flux, the allegations\ncontained herein are true and accurate to the best of\ncounsels' knowledge as of the filing of this Amended\nComplaint.\n\n- 6 -  ;\nis approximately 150 children.  Approximately one-third are\ndetained pending trial or disposition, and the other two-thirds\nare committed to the Department of Human Services.  The buildings\nat Oak Hill are newer than those at Cedar Knoll and so Oak Hill\nmay appear on the surface to be a better facility.  But scrutiny\nof the rehabilitative services at Oak Hill —  the heart of any\nfacility for caring for detained youth and treating delinquent\nyouth —  reveals that the services at Oak Hill are as deplorably\ninadequate as those at Cedar Knoll.\nThe Receiving Home for Children is a maximum level detention\nfacility for juveniles operated by the District of Columbia, and\nlocated on Mt. Olivet Road, N.E. in the District of Columbia.  In\naddition to operating as a detention facility, it also functions\nas a temporary holding facility for children who are arrested\nafter three o'clock in the afternoon and must await their court\nappearance the next morning.  Theoretically, the population is to\nbe limited to thirty-eight children.  In practice, however, it\nfrequently exceeds that number.  Routinely the additional\nchildren are then bussed at any time during the night to Cedar  ;\nKnoll.  They are then awakened at six o'clock in the morning and\n\"shipped back\" to either the Receiving Home or court on the early\nmorning bus.  The Receiving Home for Children is not an adequate\nsubstitute for a child's home.  The building itself has been\ndescribed as \"'poorly designed and functionally obsolete.1\"\nD.C. Crime Commission Report p. 675, 1966 cited in In re Savoy,\nGreen, J. Nov. 6, 1970 Memorandum Opinion at p. i3.  The space at\nthe Receiving Home is not sufficient for either proper education\nor for proper indoor recreation.  It is functionally and\nstructurally inadequate to house children properly.\nThe plaintiffs contend that the totality of the conditions\nin these juvenile detention facilities violates statutory and\nconstitutional requirements.  The plaintiffs live under\nconditions that are inhumane and that inflict needless suffering.\n\n_ 7 –  ;\nThey are deprived of the educational, vocational, mental health, ;\nand other social services that they so desperately need and that\ndefendants are obligated to provide.  The totality of these\nconditions violates the children's statutory right to appropriate\ncare and treatment under D.C. Code §S 16-2313(b) and 2320 (as\ninterpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2), their statutory rights to\nadequate educational services under D.C. Code §§ 31-401 and\n31-403 and under 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401 et seq., and their rights\n`-¦ under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States  •\nConstitution.  Secure confinement in these facilities for many  ;\nchildren also violates their right to custody care and discipline\nas nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been  ¦\nprovided by their parents, and their right to the least  ¦\nrestrictive environment consistent with their need for care,  ¦\ncustody and treatment, both under D.C. Code § 16-2313(b) and 2320\n(as interpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2) and the Fifth and Eighth  ¡\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\nAll of the named plaintiffs in this action are currently\nconfined in these detention facilities.  The named plaintiffs\ninclude children who are detained at Cedar Knoll, children\ncommitted to Cedar Knoll, children detained at Oak Hill,  ¦\nchildren committed to Oak Hill, children detained at the\nReceiving Home, and children who are committed at the Receiving  ¦\nHome.  ;\nJURISDICTION\n¡1  1.  This is a civil action for declaratory and injunctive  •\nii  ;\n¦! relief.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code §§  ¦\n;! 1.1-921(a)(2) and 11-921 (a) (3) (C).  ¦\n2.  This action seeks to redress injuries, suffered by  ¡\ni\nplaintiffs and the class they represent, for deprivation of\nrights secured by the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the  ;\nConstitution of the United States, and the Education of the\n\n- 8 -\nHandicapped Act (20 U.S.C. § 1401 et seq.).  These claims for\nrelief are brought pursuant to 42 ü.S.C. §1983.  :\n3.  This action furthermore seeks relief for defendants1\ndepriving plaintiffs and the class they represent of their  i\nrights, under the laws of the District of Columbia, to  i\nappropriate care and treatment (D.C. Code §§ 16-2313(b), 16 2320; :\nSCR-Juv. Rule 2) and educational services (D.C. Code §§ 31-401,  ¦\n:| 31-403).  ¡\n¦¦  PARTIES  ¦\nPlaintiffs  ¦\n4.  Each of the plaintiffs is presently incarcerated in a\njuvenile detention facility operated by the District of Columbia. ,\nThere are three named plaintiffs at Cedar Knoll.  Plaintiffs  j\nClarence M. and Leo J. are detained at Cedar Knoll and plaintiff '\ni\nCharles H·. is committed to the Department of Human Services and  ¦\nhas been placed at Cedar Knoll.  Four named plaintiffs are at Oak\nHill; two of them are detained there and two of them have been  ;\ncommitted to the Department of Human Services and placed there.  :\nPlaintiff Jerry M., who when this action was originally commenced\nI\nhad been detained pending trial at Cedar Knoll, is now at Oak  ¢\nHill after having been committed to the Department of Human  ¡\nServices.  Also committed and placed at Oak Hill is plaintiff  ¡\nVaun T., plaintiff Phillip C, and plaintiff David U., who had  ¦\n¡\nbeen detained at Cedar Knoll when the original complaint was  I\nfiled.  Plaintiff Omar H. is detained at Oak Hill.  Plaintiff  |\n¦ Thurmon W. is detained at the Receiving Home and ¾>laintiff Tyra\n: W. has been committed to the Department of Human Services and\n¦ placed at the Receiving Home.\n:  5.  Plaintiff Clarence M. is a seventeen year old young man\nwith educational handicaps.  His achievement levels,' especially\nin langugage skills, are well below expected grade levels.\nAlthough mental health professionals have determined that therapy\nand a supportive milieu would be of considerable value to him, he\n\n¯ 9 ¯  j\nhas received no individual or group counseling since his\ndetention at Cedar Knoll.  He participated in drug counseling\nsessions at Cedar Knoll, but these sessions ceased in early\nOctober after the Cedar Knoll students were sent to Oak Hill to\nattend school.  Moreover, Clarence's \"residual depression,\"  ;\n\"suicidal ideation,\" and suicidal behavior are not being\naddressed at Cedar Knoll.  Clarence lives in a unit at Cedar  |\nKnoll where the walls are coming down and the shower facilities  '\nare in a state of disrepair.  Prior to his incarceration,\nClarence's weight problem was being medically treated.  In the  ;\ntime since he has been at Cedar Knoll, however, he has not  ;\nreceived any medical attention for his weight problem.\n•I\n6.  Leo J. is a fourteen year old boy who is detained at  ;\nCedar Knoll.  He has been deemed chronically depressed and in  ~ !\nneed of a therapeutic placement with around-the-clock supervision\nfor the emotional problems which cause him to act in a\n  ¦\nself-destructive manner.  He needs a strong therapeutic and  i\nremedial academic program, neither of which he is getting at\nCedar Knoll.  Although he needs special education and, prior to  !\nhis incarceration,.had been enrolled at the Bundy School, a\nspecial education school for emotionally disturbed children, he  j\nhas not received any special education during his period of  ¡\nj\nincarceration.  ¡\n7.  Charles H. is a seventeen year old young man who has  |\nbeen committed to the Department of Human Services and placed at :\nI\nCedar Knoll.  While in the community Charles attended school  I\ni\nregularly and was enrolled in the Community Services Program,  ¦\ni\ncompleting all the working hours required of him.  Given that  ¦\nCharles is seventeen and has a two year old child who lives with |\nhis mother, he clearly needs vocational education which will  ¦\nenable him to support his family upon his release.  He receives  \\\nno such education at Cedar Knoll.  Moreover, Charles' classes are\novercrowded with many students and few teachers.  •\n8.  Plaintiff Jerry M. is an eighteen year old man with\neducational handicaps.  He has been diagnosed as functioning \"in ¦\n!\nI\n\n- 10 -  :\nthe low end of the borderline retarded range\" and as needing a\n\"full-time special education placement for emotionally disturbed\nadolescents.\"  Prior to his incarceration at Cedar Knoll and Oak\nHill, Jerry attended a special education school in the community.\nBut during his detention at Cedar Knoll and ultimate placement at\nOak Hill, he has been placed in regular education classes with\nthe general population.  Most of the school curriculum is above\nhis level, and he finds that the teachers invariably move through\ni\nthe material too quickly for him to comprehend.  i\n9.  Vaun T. is a seventeen year old boy who has been  ¦\ncommitted to the Department of Human Services and placed at Oak  j\nHill.  Although Vaun has been deemed in need of individual  ¦\ncounseling, he has not received it.  Moreover, he has not  ¯:\nreceived any drug counseling.  He has seen a social worker only  ¦\nonce in two and one half.months.  Vaun has little opportunity to !\nparticipate in recreational activities and spends most of his  :\nfree time involved in relatively idle activities such as watching\ntelevision or playing cards.  In addition, Vaun's above-average\nintellectual abilities have not been challenged by the school\nprogram at Oak Hill.\n10.  Plaintiff Phillip C. is a sixteen year old boy who has\nbeen committed to the Department of Human Services and placed at\nOak Hill.  Prior to his incarceration Phillip spent the summer\nmonths working at MacDonald's during the day and assisting his\nfather in construction work during the evening hours.  He had\nbeen enrolled in Anacostia Senior High School.  Phillip was\nassaulted in his room by other residents who attacked him and  ;\nbroke his jaw.  As a result, Phillip was in the hospital for  ¡\napproximately six weeks.  At the time he received his injury it\nwas two days before his jaw was even X-rayed.  He received no\nschooling while in the Oak Hill hospital and because he was the\nonly patient there, he was effectively in \"solitary confinement.\n11.  Plaintiff David U. is a sixteen year old youth with\nsubstantial emotional problems.  He has been diagnosed as\n\n- 11 -  ¦\nseverely depressed, passive-dependent, and possibly suffering\nfrom brain disfunction.  Mental health professionals have\ndetermined that David needs a structured program of education and\nvocational training, and requires individual counseling.  Yet,\nduring the months that David has been at the Children's Center he\nhas not received any appropriate educational, vocational, or\npsychological services.\n12.  Plaintiff Omar H. is a seventeen year old youth who\nfunctions in the mildly mentally retarded range and has\ncognitive deficits in visual-motor performance.  While in the\ncommuity, Omar attended a special educational school.  But while\nat Oak Hll —  during a previous period of incarcertaion and\nduring his present period of detention —  Omar is deprived of\nappropriate special education services and attends class with the\ngeneral population.  :\n13.  Thurmon W. is a fifteen year old boy who is detained at\nthe Receiving Home.  Due-to his emotional problems, which\ninterfere with his learning, Thurmon has been deemed in need of\nspecial education.  At age fifteen he is functioning academically,\nfive to nine years below normal for his age group.  Nevertheless\nhis special education needs have gone unmet during his period of\nincarcertion.\n14.  Fourteen year old Tyra W. is an emotionally disturbed\nteenager in need of a multitude of services which include\nindividual therapy, special educational services, and sexual  ¦\nidentification counseling.  She has been at the Receiving Home  ¡\n•  i\nsince August 26, 1985, awaiting a residential placement, and has ;i\nnot received the appropriate mental health and educational  ¡\ni\nservices she requires.  During her incarceration at the Receiving'\n¡\nHome, there has been one counselor who has been abusive towards  I\nher in a variety of ways, and who once, while drunk, threatened  :\nTyra with a knife.\n15.  Plaintiffs bring this action by and through their next\nfriend. Donna Wulkan, Clinical Instructor in the Antioch School\n\n- 12 -\nof Law Juvenile Rights Clinic and Developmental Disabilities Law\nClinic.  Ms. Wulkan is qualified to serve as next friend for the\n.named plaintiffs and the class which they represent, and will\nf  fully and actively advocate the interests of both the named¯ ¯\nplaintiffs and the class.  In Palmer v. Barry, C.A. 84-1077 (D.\nD.C. 1984), the Honorable Harold Greene appointed Ms. Wulkan as\nguardian ad litem for the class of all former, current and future\n: residents of St. Elizabeths Hospital Division of Child and\n. Adolescent Services.  In that capacity, Ms. Wulkan participated\nin negotiations with the District of Columbia and entered into a\nsettlement on behalf of the entire class of children.\nClass Action Allegations  ;\n16.  This is a class action under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(i)\nand (2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.\nPlaintiffs are representative of the class which is composed of  ¡\nall persons presently confined in District of Columbia juvenile\ndetention facilities or who may be so confined in the future.\n17.  Plaintiffs are members of the class and their claims  j\nare typical of all class members.\n18.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.  There are approximately 200-250 children\ncurrently confined in the juvenile detention facilities.  In\naddition, there is an indeterminate number of children who may be\nconfined in these facilities in the future.\n19.  The questions of law and fact presented by the\na\n¡ plaintiffs are common to the class.  Plaintiffs live under common\n`. conditions of confinement, have common grievances and seek\n! common relief.  The basic legal issues presented by this action\n—  the defendants' violation of statutory and constitutional\nrequirements for appropriate care and treatment' of incarcerated\nchildren —  are common to the class as a whole.\n20.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.  The relief sought in this case, the\n\n- 13 -\nimprovement of living conditions and programs in District of\nColumbia juvenile detention facilities, will benefit all members\nof the class.  Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel\nwho will adequately protect the interests of the class.\n21.  The defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\ninjunctive and declaratory relief with repsect to the classs as a\nwhole.  Since the named plaintiffs seek to reform living\nconditions and programs in the juvenile detention facilities,\nadjudication with respect to some children confined in these\nfacilities would be dispositive of the interests of other\nchildren not parties to the action.  Prosecution of separate\nactions by individual children would create a risk of\ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual\nmembers of the class, which would subject the population of the\ndetention facilities to varying conditions or standards of\nconfinement.\nDefendants.\n22.

Physical Structure  .  ¡\n32. The vast majority of residential units at Cedar Knoll  ;\n¡\nYouth Center —  including both buildings housing detained youth  ¡\nand buildings housing committed children —  are in a state  of\ndisrepair.  The living conditions in these buildings are  :\ninadequate, inhumane, and hazardous to the residents' health and\nsafety.  ;\n33.  The vast majority of residential units have substantial\nholes in the walls.and most buildings have major holes in the  ;\nceilings.  Plaster has fallen in large pieces, and in some  ¦\nbuildings, the outer brick layer is completely exposed.  This is\ntrue even in units such as Carver, Jefferson, and Bunche, which\nwere renovated in recent years but have not been properly  ;\nmaintained.  ¦\n34.  These residential units  provide inadequate shelter  j\nfrom the cold during the winter months.  Most of the buildings  J\nhave windows that either have broken glass (which is not repaired;\nfor lengthy periods of time) or cannot be closed because of  j\nI\nfaulty closing mechanisms.  Even the windows that are fully  ¡\nj\nintact provide inadequate shelter, because they lack any form of ¡\ninsulation and the cold air pierces the window casings.\n3/  As of the filing of this Amended Complaint, there are\napproximately seventy-eight children incarcerated at\nCedar Knoll.  These include both detained and committed\nchildren.\n\n- 16 -\n35.  The fixtures and furnishings of the buildings are\n^totally deteriorated.  The walls have large strips of peeling\n-paint.  There are so£as with the stuffings either totally removed\nor dangling from the sofa onto the floor, and with the springs\nexposed.  There are beds with the metal slats so bent that the\nbed cannot be used comfortably.  Wall sockets are totally exposed\nand give electric shocks when used.  Many of the electrical\nappliances used in the residences, such as television sets and\nfloor buffers, have stripped cords which also cause electric\nshocks to residents.  ,  ;\n36.  The utility services of the facility are inadequately\noperated and maintained.  The heating and plumbing services are\nso old and deteriorated, that they regularly overflow, flooding  ¦\nareas and periodically necessitating the temporary closure of  '\ncottages.  The conditions in several of the cottages violate fire\nsafety requirements.  Many of the cells are overheated while  ¡\nothers lack any heat at all.  In either situation the residents  .\nare unable to regulate the heat in their individual cells.  .\n37.  The vast majority of the cottages are infested with  :\nvermin.\n38.  Plaintiff Clarence M. lives in Jefferson Cottage.  '\nDespite the fact that it was renovated only several years ago,\nhis building suffers from broken walls, peeling paint, falling  ;\nplaster, ramshackle furniture, and vermin.  Moreover, the walls  ¡\nof the showers are falling apart.\n^·  Educational Services  ¦\ni.  Introduction\n39.  The Department of Human Services has assumed the\nDistrict of Columbia's responsibility for providing educational\nservices to children who are detained or committed in the\nDistrict's detention facilities.\n\n- 17 -  i\n40.  In the nearly nine months since the original complaint\nwas filed in this case the \"educational program\" at Cedar Knoll\nhas been completely erratic and has changed several times.  There\nis nothing to indicate that by the time this case goes to trial,\nthe \"educational program\" will not have changed further.\n41.  In March, 1985, when this suit was commenced, the\nchildren attended school on the grounds at Cedar Knoll. The\neducational services consisted of essentially two types of\nservices:  (a) Academic courses paralleling the traditional\nschool curriculum and provided to the general population of the\nfacility [hereinafter referred to as \"general educational\n  :\nservices\"]; and (b) \"special educational services\" for residents\nwho were educationally handicapped as a result of learning  :\ndisabilities, mental retardation, emotional disturbance, or other\ndevelopmental or organic disorders.\n42.  The vast majority of the children in the District's  j\ndetention facilities are educationally handicapped and in need of!\nspecial educational services.  In addition, even among the\nremaining general population, there are large numbers of students\nwho require special attention (because of behavior and adjustment\nproblems in the school setting) and remedial tutoring (to\novercome gaps in their formal education caused by sporadic\nschool attendance in prior years).  ¦\n43.  After the Cedar Knoll school was closed in June, 1985,\nthe children were bussed to Oak Hill to attend summer school,  |\nwhich, as discussed infra at paragraphs 83 through 92 inclusive, j\ni\nwas  inadequate.  Moreover,  the  Cedar Knoll  teachers  were  `·\ntransferred  to  teach  at  Oak Hill.  At  the  end  of  the  summer,  due ,\nto  defendants'  lack  of  planning  for  the  fall  semester,  the  ¦\nchildren  at  Cedar Knoll  received  no education  whatsoever.  !\nEventually  Oak Hill  teachers,  working  overtime,  were detailed  to ;\nCedar Knoll  between  four  o'clock  and  seven  o'clock  in  the  evening\nto  teach  the  children  at  Cedar Knoll  in  their  units.  This meant\n\n- 18 -\nthat the children never left their units.  Because these Oak Hill\nteachers appeared only sporadically, it was decided that the\nCedar Knoll children should be bussed, yet again, to attend\nschool at Oak Hill.  In essence, in a matter of several months,\nthe Cedar Knoll children have been subjected to at least four\ndifferent \"academic regimens,\" which have ranged from no\n¦; schooling at all to inadequate \"educational programs\" at best.\ni,\n|  ii. General Educational Services\n44.  The Cedar Knoll School was grossly inadequate.  The\nschool lacked sufficient teachers, educational aides, and support\nservices, and employed teachers who were not adequately qualified\nand who were not certified under the criteria of D.C. Public\n  ;\nSchools.  The facility placed children of widely ranging\nabilities and needs into a single class.  Under these impossible\nteaching conditions, the teachers abandoned even the semblance of\nattending to all the students in their classes.  The teachers\ngenerally directed their attention to only a handful of students,\nwhile allowing the remaining students to play cards or other\ngames in class.  There were frequent absences by teachers, and  :\nthe lack of any substitute teachers resulted in cancellations of ;\nclasses during these teacher absences.  Plaintiff Jerry M.\nattended the Cedar Knoll School, and received an inadequate\neducation as a result of these deficiencies in the services.\n45.  The defendants failed to provide any educational  !\n  ¦\n`l·  *\ny. services whatsoever to the residents of Bunche Cottage, the  '\n;;. auxiliary maximum security cottage.  These children were not  !\n:: allowed to leave their cottage to attend school, and defendants ¡'\ndid not send a teacher into the cottage to teach the children.  ¡\nPlaintiff David U. resided in Bunche Cottage for approximately  i\nthree months, and received no educational services during that  ¡\nperiod of time.\n\n- 19 -\n46.  Paragraph 84, infra, is hereby incorporated regarding\ntfch¯e¯ inadequacies of general educational services at Oak Hill.\niii.  Special Educational Services\n47.  Under the federal Education of the Handicapped Act, all\neducationally handicapped children are entitled to special\neducation and related services.  (The law explicitly extends the\nbenefits of special educational services to children in  ;\ncorrectional institutions.)  The law requires the District to  ¦\nidentify, evaluate, and provide special educational services to ¦\nthose children in its correctional facilities who are  •¦\neducationally handicapped.  Yet, with respect to the population :\nof children who are confined at Cedar Knoll, the District failed ¦\nand continues to fail on all three of these requirements of\nidentification, evaluation, and provision of services.  In the\ntime since the original complaint was filed in this case, the\nGovernment Accounting Office's October, 19 85 Report to the\nHouse of Representatives' Ranking Minority Member Committee on  ;\nthe District of Columbia found, at best, an inadequate provision\nof special educational services at Cedar Knoll, and at worst, a\ncomplete absence of any teachers there certified to teach in a\nspecial education program.  ;\n48.  The District failed and continues to fail to identify\nthe handicapping conditions of the majority of educationally  ¦\nhandicapped children confined at Cedar Knoll, because the  ¡\n•  i\ndefendants do not properly test or evaluate these children, do\nnot obtain their educational records from the schools that the  ¦\nchildren attended prior to their incarceration, and do not employ\npersons trained and qualified to identify children with specific\nlearning and educational handicaps.\n\n- 20 -\n49.  The District failed and continues to fail to properly\ne¯vàlúate educationally handicapped children at Cedar Knoll, in\nthat the defendants rely heavily on tests that are administered\nby people who have not been properly trained to administer them,\nand their evaluations are made by persons who often lack\nspecialized knowledge of the specific area of disability of the\nchildren.\n50.  The District violated and continues to violate its\nstatutory duty to provide adequate and appropriate special\neducational services to all educationally handicapped children at\nCedar Knoll, in all the following respects:\na.  Children who are truly educationally\nhandicapped, but have never been\nidentified as such by Cedar Knoll\nwere and continue to be placed in\nregular classrooms with the general\npopulation, and thereby foreclosed\nfrom special educational services?\nb. ¯Even when the defendants did and do\nidentify a Cedar Knoll resident as\neducationally handicapped, the\ndeficiencies in the evaluation process\nresulted in and continue to result in an\nIndividualized Education Plan\ninappropriate for the child's specific\ndisabilities and needs;\nc.  Even when the defendants have prepared\n.  or obtained a proper Indiviâualized\nEducation Plan, the services actually\nprovided to the child did and do not\nfulfill the specifications of the Plan and did\nand do not adequately serve the child's special\n\n- 21 -  I\neducational needs.  The Cedar Knoll\n....-..._- -  teachers, who were assigned and continue\nc\nV  to be assigned the responsibility for\n/  providing special education, are untrained\nin the specific learning disabilities' from\nwhich the children suffer, and are not\nprovided the time, resources, and equipment  ,\n` `i  `\nj  necessary to provide an appropriate  :\n¦!  education to these children.\n51.  Furthermore, in the course of evaluating and placing\nchildren, the defendants failed and continue to fail to afford  '\nCedar Knoll residents and their parents the procedural rights  ;\nwhich are guaranteed by federal law.  Upon admitting children who\nwere in special education classes in the community, the facility\nroutinely changed and continues to change the child's educational\nsetting to a general educational classs without notifying the\nchild's parents of the change in educational placement and their\nright to contest the change.  When the facility itself identifies\na child as handicapped and ordered or orders a preplacement  i\nevaluation to determine specific educational needs, the  ¡\ndefendants did and do not notify the child's parents of the\nidentification of a handicap or secure their written consent for |\na preplacement evaluation.  The defendants also frequently failed\nand continue to fail to notify parents of the results of  .\nj\nevaluations, their right to a hearing to contest the evaluation, \\\nl¦\n1  their  right  to obtain  an  independent  educational  evaluation  at  ¦\n¦!  ì\n. public expense, and the nature of the tests, records, and reports!\nrelied upon to make the evaluation.  Finally, in scheduling\nmeetings for the purpose of preparing Individualized Education\n¡\nPlans,  the  defendants  did  and do not  consistently  observe  ¡\nstatutory  requirements  for  proper  and  timely  notice  to  the  |\nchildren's  parents.  :\n\n- 22 -\nC.  Vocational Training Services\nV  52.  Defendants fail to provide any vocational training\n/  program whatsoever at Cedar Knoll.  The facility offers neither\nshop programs nor pre-vocational counseling.  Although the\nfacility at one time had a series of shop programs, these have\nall been eliminated.  The only remaining shop, a printing shop,\nhas only one student in it, and is in the process of being\ndismantled for transfer to Oak Hill Youth Center.  ;\n53.  Plaintiff Charles H. suffers from the lack of any  ¦\nvocational services at Cedar Knoll.  At age seventeen and with a :\ngirlfriend and a two-year old child who lives with Charles1  i\nfamily, Charles clearly needs to prepare himself to support them ,\nupon his release.  Charles, prior to his incarceration, showed  ]\ninterest in his child and was attentive to her.  His admirable\nassumption of such a responsibility is only thwarted by  :\ní\ndefendants' failure to equip him to support his family when he is\nreleased.\nD.  Mental Health Services  i\n54.  The mental health services offered at Cedar Knoll are\ninadequate to meet the needs of a resident population that has a\ndisproportionately large number of children with mental problems\nand emotional disturbances.  `\n55.  The psychiatric services are virtually,non-existent.  ¡\n```  Cedar Knoll receives the part-time services of psychiatrist Andre\nAceituno, whom it shares with Oak Hill and Forest Haven facility j\nfor mentally retarded persons.  Dr. Aceituno's services to Cedar ¦\nKnoll are limited to seeing residents in emergency situations\n(such as suicide attempts), and he does not provide psychiatric\ntherapy on a regular basis to residents.  Even when Dr. Aceituno\ndoes see a student, his limited facility with the English\nlanguage impairs •communications with the child.\n\n- 23 -\n56.  Although Cedar Knoll previously had the regular\nservices of psychologists J. Leonard Scheinker and Darwin\nRaymore, these psychologists were obligated to divide their time\nV\nbetween diagnostic testing of newly committed residents and\ntherapy.  As a result, the psychological services which they\noffered were impaired in all the following respects:\na.  The testing was often insufficiently\ncomprehensive to detect and identify\nthe precise mental health needs of\nthe residents;\nb.  The inadequate time for therapy forced\nthe psychologists to adopt a \"triage\"\npolicy of providing therapy only to\nthe most needy and as a result, many\nresidents' mental health needs went\nunattended;\nc.  The facility followed a policy of\ndenying therapy services to the\n¯entire detained population, with the\nexception of those children who had\nbeen court-ordered to receive therapy\nwhile detained;\nd.  Even when the psychology department\ndid provide therapy to residents, it\nwas almost exclusively group therapy,\nand residents' needs for individual\ntherapy were frequently unmet.\n57.  Presently Dr. Scheinker is assigned full-time to the\nReceiving Home and Mr. Raymore, who had been detailed to Cedar\nKnoll for half of the work day during the summer, is assigned to\nOak Hill and is never at Cedar Knoll unless he is specifically\ncalled to go there.\n\n- 24 -\n58.  Plaintiff Clarence M. has significant mental problems.\nHe has been identified as having \"some residual depression\nrelated to [his] family\" especially concerning an incident in\nwhich he was stabbed in the back by a household member.\nMoreover, during his incarceration he has exhibited,suidical\nideation and has engaged in suicidal gestures.  Although therapy\nhas been recommended, Clarence has not received either\npsychiatric or psychological therapy services.\nE.  Medical Services\n¯59.  The defendants have failed to secure sufficient\npersonnel and facilities at Cedar Knoll to provide adequate  :\nmedical care to the residents.  There is not a physician or even\na registered nurse on duty twenty-four hours a day.  The  ¦\ncounselors and other direct care staff are not adequately trained\nin first aid or in how to deal with medical emergencies.\nMoreover, when medical emergencies do occur, there are not\nadequate facilities and staff for quickly transporting residents\nto medical care.\n60.  Plaintiff Clarence M. has a severe weight problem\nwhich was being medically treated prior to his incarceration.\nSince his incarceration, there has been a complete lack of any\nmedical attention to this problem.\nP.  Counseling Services, Social Services,\nand Direct Care\n61.  In every cottage of Cedar Knoll, the juvenile residents,\nof the cottage are supervised by adult counselors.  These  •\ncounselors have the primary responsibility for direct care and  !\nsupervision of the residents.  The facility then provides \"social ¦\nservice representatives,\" who have the responsibility for  ¦\nproviding social services to groups of residents that have been  ¦\nassigned to them.  ¡\n62.  The majority of the \"social service representatives\" do\nnot have the requisite training or certification to provide\nsocial work services.  As a result, these workers do not do an  ;\n\n- 25 -\nadequate job of assessing the residents' needs, counseling the\nResidents; and-arranging for appropriate services.  The \"social\nSirvfcë representatives\" are not properly supervised and do not\n¦  receive a consistent program of in-service training.\n63.  Although a large proportion of the population of Cedar\nKnoll suffers from drug abuse and drug dependency problems, the\nfacility does not provide a drug counseling program for its\n'; residents.\n¦:  64.  Cedar Knoll does not have a sufficient number of\ncounselors to provide direct care and supervision to all of its\nresidents.  The facility attempts to redress this deficiency by\npermitting counselors to work overtime for higher pay.  As a  |\nresult, a large proportion of the Cedar Knoll staff works long  \\\novertime hours, often working as many as sixty or eighty hours\na week.  The effect upon the counselors' performance is profound:\ncounselors fail to provide adequate supervision and care for the\nresidents, and display irritability and short tempers in dealing\nwith the residents.  •\n65.  Defendants fail to arrange adequate supervision of\ncounselors' work, and fail to provide adequate and consistent\ntraining of counselors.\nG.  Climate of Violence\n66.  As a result of the following actions, omissions, and\npolicies, the defendants have created a \"climate of violence\" at\nCedar Knoll that pervades the daily lives of the residents:\ni  •  ¦\n''  a.  The inadequate training and supervision  :\ni  of the counselors has resulted in a  ;\n;•  situation in which counselors periodically  ¦\ncommit physical assaults upon the youthful  ¡\nresidents; and\nb.  The staff's inadequate supervision of  ¡\nresidents (due to the insufficiency of\nstaff and the inadequate training of\nstaff) has resulted in a situation in  ;\n\n- 26 -\nwhich residents are able to physically\nassault other residents.\nThese conditions not only result in physical harm to the\nresidents who have been assaulted (by counselors or other\nresidents), but also result in psychological harm to the\nremaining residents who witness these assaults and live in\nconstant fear of being injured.\n67.  In addition to the incidents reported in the original  ¦\ncomplaint, page 24, paragraphs 6 2 and 63, hereby incorporated by :\ni\nreference, Plaintiff Clarence M. is aware of incidents involving !\ncounselor abuse of students and lives in fear that he will fall  ;\nvictim to such violence and abuse.\nH.  Procedures for Disciplining Residents  :\n68.  In an Order issued on November 3, 1976, the Family\nDivision in In re Savoy, J-4808-70, established detailed\nprocedures for disciplining children who are confined in District\nof Columbia juvenile detention facilities.  The defendants  •\nsubsequently incorporated these procedures into Institutional  i\nCare Services Division Rule 4.12.\n69.  The defendants, however, have failed to take the steps\nnecessary to ensure that these procedures are followed on a daily\n :\nbasis by the direct care staff or Cedar Knoll.  ¦\ni\n70.  In contravention of the standards established in In re :\nSavoy and Rule 4.12, the counselors at Cedar Knoy. have violated ¡\nthe standards in a variety of ways, including, imposing  ¡\npunishments without an adjudicatory hearing.  :\n¯  `  i\nI.  Recreational Services  j\nI\n71.  At the time the original complaint was filed, the  :\nI\nrecreational program at Cedar Knoll consisted of periodic  ¦\nbasketball games and non-physical activities such as television.\n\n- 27 -\nmovies and card games.  The Cedar Knoll staff did not ensure that\nall the residents had an adequate amount of daily major muscle\nactivities.  Presently, plaintiffs are afforded almost no\nphysical or recreational activity and spend most of their time\nlocked in their units watching television or playing cards.\n72.  The defendants have failed to establish an adequate,\nstructured physical education program at Cedar Knoll.  Defendants\nfurthermore have failed to establish a program to teach leisure\ntime recreational activities such as music and crafts.  !\n¡\nJ.  Procedures for Attorney-Client Communications\ni\n73.  In  both  their  visitation  policies  and  telephone  \\\npolicies,  defendants  improperly  interfere  with  attorneys1  access !\nto  their  clients.  :\n74.  If  an attorney  wishes  to meet with  a detained  client,\ndefendants  will  transport  the  child  to  the  Receiving  Home.  But  ¦\ndefendants  have  failed  to  establish  sufficient  interview  rooms  at\nthe  Receiving Home.  As a result,  attorneys  frequently  are  unable\nto  meet with  their  clients  because  all  of  the  rooms  are  already  ;\nfilled  by other  attorneys,  probation  officers,  or  mental  health\nprofessionals.\n75.  Defendants  have,  moreover,  adopted  a policy  of\nprecluding  transportation  of  committed  residents  to  the  Receiving\nHome for  the  purpose  of  attorney-client  meetings.  As a  result,\nan attorney  representing  a child  in  a post-commitment  proceeding  .\nmust  travel  to Laurel,  Maryland  to  meet with  his  client.  j\n76.  The defendants  have  adopted  a policy  of  closing  Cedar\nKnoll's  telephone  switchboard  in  the  evenings,  and  thereby  I\nprecluding  any  calls  to  residents  during  the  evening  hours.  The |\nI\ndefendants  have  in  this  manner  severely  impaired  attorney-client  ,\n!\ncommunications  since  attorneys  who are  in  court  all  day  often  ¦\nmust  use  the  evening  hours  to  call  clients.  `  '.\n\n-  28 -\nK.  Procedures  for  Family  Visitation\n77.  For  the  children  at  Cedar Knoll,  like  all  children,  the\nemotional  bonds  to  their  parents  are  a crucial  stabilizing  and\nshaping  influence  on the  child's  development.  Because  children\nconfined  at  Cedar Knoll  are  physically  separated  from  their  ,\nparents,  many for  the  first  time  in  their  lives,  it  is  vital  that\nthe  children  be permitted  frequent  contact  with  their  parents.  :\n78.  The defendants  have  adopted  policies  that  have  the  ¦\neffect  of  limiting  committed  children's  family  visits  to  one day\na month.  Defendants  technically  permit  visits  every  weekend.\nHowever,  most of  the  children's  parents  are  impoverished  and do  `,\nnot  own automobiles  that  they  can drive  to Laurel,  Maryland.  The\ndefendants  do operate  a bus  that  will  transport  detained  ;\nchildren's  parents  from  the  Receiving  Home to  Cedar Knoll  for\nvisits  with  their  children,  but  defendants  limit  the  use of  this\nbus by committed  children's  parents  to one day  a month.  :\nII.  Oak Hill  Youth Center  :\nA.  Physical  Structure  ;\n79.  Although  the  physical  structure  of  Oak Hill  is  not  as  ]\ndecrepit  as Cedar Knoll's,  Oak Hill  suffers  from  several  ¡\nstructural  flaws  and  defects.  In  many of  the  cottages,  there  are\nholes  in  ceilings  and walls,  broken windows,  and broken  lights.  ¡\nAppliances  such  as  refrigerators,  telephones  and  air  vents,\n  ;\nconstantly  malfunction.  Several  of  the  cottages  are  infested  !\nì\nwith vermin.\n80.  Many of the cottages fail to comply with fire safety\nrequirements.  There are fire extinguishers which are empty and\nneed to be re-charged.  The keys to fire boxes and extinguishers\nfrequently are not kept on the unit, and therefore these\nprotective devices are inaccessible in an emergency.\n\n- 29 -\n81.  The cottages at Oak Hill are not designed to protect\nresidents from extreme weather conditions.  In the winter months\nthe lack of adequate insulation allows the cold air to pierce the\nV\n/  walls and window frames.  During the intense heat of the summer\nmonths, the lack of air conditioning in the cottages renders the\nchildren's rooms almost unbearable.\n82.  Plaintiff Jerry M. lives in a cottage in which\nconditions exist violative of fire safety requirements.  During\n¦  the summer months, because no air-conditioning exists in the\ncottage, living conditions become unbearable.\nB.  Educational Services\nThe Department of Human Services has assumed the\nDistrict's obligation for providing educational services to\nchildren who are detained at or committed to Oak Hill.  As at\nCedar Knoll, the vast majority of the Oak Hill residents are\neducationally handicapped and in need of special educational\nservices.  In addition, even the remaining students, who are  `\ncapable of attending general educational classes, often require\nspecial attention (because of behavior and adjustment problems\nin the school setting) and remedial tutoring.  Moreover, the\ninadequacy of the educational program has been¯ exacerbated by the\ntransfer of Cedar Knoll children to Oak Hill for education.  As a\nresult of this transfer, all detained Oak Hill residents housed\nin Unit Seven now receive their schooling in the unit and not in\n;¦ the school building which is used for the Cedar Knoll children.  ¡\n; Because of the lack of space in the school building at Oak Hill, '\nthe Unit Seven residents remain in their unit virtually all day\nevery day.  ;\n\n- 30 -\ni.  General Educational Services\n/  84.  The defendants have organized Oak Hill School in a\nmanner that totally frustrates any hope of providing a\nmeaningful education to the residents.  Rather than placing\nstudents in classes according to their educational abilities, the\ndefendants have organized classes by cottage grouping:  a cottage\nof 20 residents will attend class together.  But residents'\ncottage placements are randomly selected, and the educational\nabilities within each cottage vary widely.  Thus, a single  ¡\nteacher will be confronted with a cottage group whose abilities  ¡\nrange from third grade to college level.  Given these teaching  j\nconditions and the lack of sufficient educational aides and  j\nsupportive services, the •Oak Hill teachers generally tailor their1\ncurricula to the low median level of the group and ignore the\nacademic needs of students above and below that level.  ;\n85.  Plaintiff Vaun T. functions intellectually well above\naverage.  In addition, he has a high intellectual potential and  \\\nhas been identified as possibly being a gifted child.  Although  ,\nit had been recommended that he be provided individualized  '\ntutorial instruction which would allow him to proceed at an  !\naccelerated pace, this has not been done during Vaun's  ¡\nincarceration at Oak Hill.  :\nii. Special Educational Services  ¦\n*\n¦;  ¡\n86.  As at Cedar Knoll (see paragraphs 47-51), the  j\nI;  ¦\n¦  defendants fail to fulfill their federal statutory duties to\nidentify, evaluate, and provide appropriate-special education and\nrelated services to educationally handicapped children who are\nconfined at Oak Hill Youth Center.  In the time since the  ¡\noriginal complaint was filed these allegations have been  i\nconfirmed by a study of the General Accounting Office which found\na complete lack of any special educational services whatsoever\n\n- 31 -\nat Oak Hill.  See, Report to the House of Representatives'\nRanking Minority Member Committee on the District of Columbia\n(October 17, 1985).\n87.  The defendants fail to identify the handicapping\nconditions of these children because the defendants do not\nproperly test or evaluate the children, do not obtain their\neducational records from their prior community-based schools, and\ndo not employ persons trained and qualified to identify children\nwith specific learning and educational handicaps.  •\n88.  The evaluation procedures employed at Oak Hill are\ndeficient, in that defendants rely heavily on tests administered `\nby people who have not been properly trained to administer them, !\nand the evaluations are conducted by persons lacking specialized\nknowledge in the specific areas of disability.  ,\n89.  The defendants violate their duty to provide\nappropriate special educational services to all handicapped Oak\nHill residents, in that:  (a) Children who are truly handicapped,\nbut have never been identified as such by Oak Hill, are placed in\nregular classrooms and foreclosed from special educational\nservices; (b) Defendants fail to prepare Individualized Education\nPlans appropriate to the specific needs of the handicapped\nchildren, even when the facility does identify their handicaps; ¡\nand (c) Even when defendants do prepare or obtain a proper\nIndividualized Education Plan, the services actually provided to\nthe child do not fulfill the specifications of the Plan and do\nnot adequately serve the child's special educational needs.  .\n90.  In the course of evaluating and placing children, the i\ndefendants furthermore fail to afford Oak Hill residents and\ntheir parents their procedural due process rights.  Defendants  ¦\nfail to properly notify residents' parents of changes in their  |\nchildren's educational settings, identification of handicaps, and\nscheduling of meetings to prepare Individualized Education\n\n- 32 -\nPlans, fail to obtain these parents' written consent for\npreplacement evaluations, and fail to properly advise these\nparents of their procedural rights to contest the facility's\nevaluation.\n91.  The defendants have failed to identify the educational\nhandicaps of Jerry M·, who attends regular educational classes at\nOak Hill School.  When he was educationally evaluated by Cedar\nKnoll staff, the staff did not identify any specific handicapping\nconditins or need for special educational services.  The Cedar\nKnoll.educational assessment recommended nothing more than  ¦\n\"[t]utoring in mathematics.\"  Yet, prior to his incarceration,  '•\nJerry was evaluated by the Superior Court Child Guidance Clinic\nand D.C. Public Schools as \"functioning . ..  in the low end of\nthe borderline retarded range\" and as requiring \"[a] full-time  i\nI\nspecial education placement for emotionally disturbed  i\nadolescents.\"  Consistent with his evaluation, Jerry had been\nplaced by D.C. Public Schools in a full-time special education\nschool and provided with an Individualized Education Plan.  When\ndefendants transferred him to a regular educational setting and\nrefused to implement his Individualized Education Plan,  ¡\ndefendants violated the substantive and procedural requirements\nspecified in the federal statute.  ;\n92.  The defendants have similarly failed to adequately  j\nevaluate the educational needs of plaintiff Omar H.  While in the\ncommunity, Omar was found to be educationally handicapped and was\ni\nplaced in a special education school.  A Child G·idance Clinic  ¦\nevaluation determined that Omar functions in the mildly mentally !\nretarded range and suffers from cognitive deficits in visual-  ¡\nmotor performance.  But Oak Hill has chosen to place Omar in a  j\nregular education setting with nothing more than Chapter I  ¦\nsupplementary services.  In changing Omar's special educational  ¡\nstatus, defendants failed to comply with the substantive and  ¦\nprocedural criteria of the federal statute.  .\n\n- 33 -\nC.  Vocational Training Services\nV  9 3.  Vocational training should be a vital component of the\n/  Oak Hill rehabilitative program.  The residents of Oak Hill tend\nto be older than those at Cedar Knoll; most of the Oak Hill  ·.\nresidents are between the ages of 16 and 19.  Because of their\n: academically deprived backgrounds, most of these youths have\nlittle prospects for or interest in pursuing higher education and\nprofessional careers.  They intend to enter the job market as\nquickly as possible, but their lack of any vocational skills  ;\nrenders them virtually unemployable.  If Oak Hill is to fulfill i\nits function of rehabilitating these youths and preparing them  \\\nfor a productive future, then adquate vocational training is  ¡\ncrucial.\n94.  In spite of these compelling considerations, the\ndefendants fail to •provide meaningful vocational training at Oak\nHill.  The only true vocational training class taught by a\nqualified instructor is a class in barbering.  The class serves :\nonly a handful of` students.  Moreover, the class is of marginal\nvalue since it teaches only traditional barbering, rather than\nthe more competitive skill of hair-styling.  ¦\n95.  Plaintiff Omar H. has been deemed in need of vocational\ntraining \"in a field such as painting, building maintenance or\nthe culinary arts.\"  While incarcerated at Oak Hill he has  !\nreceived no vocational training whatsoever.\ni,  96.  Similarly, Plaintiff David U., has received no\nvocational training at Oak Hill despite the fact that it was\n!  recommended by defendants1 own contractor that he be placed in a\nprogram to meet his vocational needs.  This is a particularly\negregious situation because he had demonstrated great industry in\nthe past by working on an ice-cream truck where he handled his\njob responsibly.\n\n- 34 -\nD.  Mental Health Services\n97.  The psychiatric services at Oak Hill are provided on a\n/  part-time contractual basis by Dr. Andre Aceituno, who provides\n20 hours of services per week, and Dr. William Goldstein, who\nprovides 10 hours per week.' As earlier described (see paragraph\n55, supra), Dr. Aceituno has difficulties in communicating with\nresidents because of his limited facility with the English\nlanguage.  In continuing to retain his services, and indeed\nrelying on him for the bulk of psychiatric services at Oak Hill,\ndefendants have violated their duty to provide children at Oak\nHill with adequate psychiatric assistance.\n  ;\n98.  Defendants employ psychologists Robert Diener, Samuel\nStayton, and Darwin Raymore to provide therapy services for all\nof Oak Hill and also to prepare psychological assessments of all\nnewly committed children.  As a result, defendants have curtailed\ntherapy services in the following manner:\na.  The defendants deny therapy services to\n- the entire population of detained children,\nwith- the exception of those children for\nwhom therapy has been court-ordered;\nb.  Among the committed population, defendants\nreserve therapy for the most disturbed\nresidents and thereby deny services to\nchildren who, although only mildly\ndisturbed, are in need of therapy.\"  j\n99.  Plaintiff Vaun T., has been identified by defendants  ¦\nas needing family counseling, individual counseling, and  •\nadolescent group counseling.  Notwithstanding the defendants' own\nrecommendations, he has not received any such services while\nincarcerated at Oak Hill.\n\n-  35 -\n100.  Plaintiff  David U.  suffers  from  educational  and\nemotional  handicaps  stemming  from  his  childhood.  Defendants'  own\ncontractor  deemed him  in  need  of  considerable  remedial  and\nintensive  individualized  assistance.  Despite  this  recommendation\nhe does  not  receive  therapy  of  any  sort.\nE.  Medical  Services\n101.  At Oak Hill,  as  at  Cedar Knoll,  the  defendants  fail  to\nprovide  twenty-four  hour  a day medical  services  by a physician  or\neven  a registered  nurse.  The counselors  and other  direct  care\nstaff  at  Oak Hill  are  not  trained  in  first  aid  or  how to  deal\nwith  medical  emergencies.  If  a resident  sustains  a  serious\ninjury  during  the  evening  or weekend  hours  when the  nurse  is  off\nduty,  the  counselors  frequently  defer  any  action  (or  medical\nattention)  until  the  nurse's  return.  Moreover,  even when the\ncounselors  perceive  the  need  to  transport  the  resident  to  the\nhospital  at  Forest  Haven or  to D.C.  General  Hospital,  there  are\ninadequate  procedures,  staff  and  facilities  for  rapidly\ntransporting  the  resident.\n102.  Plaintiff  Phillip  C. was severely  injured  on October  5,\n1985 when his  jaw was broken by another  resident.  An X-ray of\nPhillip's  jaw did  not  occur  until  October  7,  1985.  Moreover,\nduring  the  time  that  Phillip  remained  in  the Oak Hill  hospital,\nhe had  not  received  any  schooling  and because  there  were no other\npatients  there,  Phillip  was effectively  in  \"solitary\nconfinement.\"  !\nP.  Counseling  Services,  Social  Services,\nand Direct  Care\n103.  As at  Cedar Knoll,  defendants  deal  with  staff  shortages\nat  Oak Hill  by allowing  counselors  to  work  overtime  for  higher  !\npay.  Many of  the  counselors  at  Oak Hill  work  as  many as  sixty\n\n- 36 -\nto eighty hours in a single week.  As a result, they are\nirritable and short-tempered with the residents and fail to\nprovide adequate supervision and care.\n104. Defendants fail to arrange adequate supervision of\ncounselors' work, and fail to provide adequate and consistent\ntraining of counselors.\n105. The caseworkers (or \"social service representatives\")\nat Oak Hill, like those at Cedar Knoll, lack the requisite\ntraining and certification to provide social work services.  As  '\na result, these workers fail to adequately assess residents'\nneeds, counsel the residents, and arrange for appropriate\nservices.  The caseworkers are not properly supervised and do\nnot receive a consistent program of in-service training.  :\n106. Although a large proportion of the population at Oak\nHill suffers from drug abuse and drug dependency problems,\ndefendants fail to provide any drug counseling to these children.\nAt the time the original complaint was filed, even in cases in  '\nwhich the court had specifically ordered drug counseling for a\n  :\nparticular child, defendants frequently failed to provide or  :\narrange for such counseling.  Only recently has the facility\nprovided drug counseling for those children for whom the court\nspecifically orders it.\n107. Although during the intake interview at Oak Hill\nPlaintiff Vaun T. acknowledged that his phencyclidine usage was\nfrequent, defendants have not provided him with any drug\ncounseling during his incarceration.  Ironically,•however,\n  ¦\ndefendants have expressed the intention of arranging for\ncommunity drug counseling when Vaun he is released.  ¦\ni\nG.  Climate of violence\n108. Like at Cedar Knoll (see paragraphs 66-67, supra), the\ndefendants have created a climate of violence at Oak Hill.\n\n- 37 -\nInadequately trained and supervised counselors, short-tempered\nfrom long overtime hours, periodically assault the children who\nare in their care.\n109. As a result of the counselors' inadequate supervision\nof the residents, there are frequent assaults of residents by\nother residents.  The defendants, moreover, have failed to\nestablish classification procedures that would place children in\ncottages on the basis of their age and physical stature; children\nare randomly assigned to cottages, and children of varying ages\nand sizes all live in the same cottage.\n110. As a result of these actions and omissions of the  ¡\ndefendants, many of the children residing at Oak Hill suffer\nphysical harm.  The remaining residents suffer psychological harm\nfrom living in an atmosphere of constant fear and violence.\n111. In October of 1985, during a period of inadequate\ncounselor supervision of the residents, another resident\nassaulted plaintiff Phillip C,  fracturing his jaw.\nH.  Procedures for Disciplining Residents\n112. In an Order issued on November 3, 1976, the Family\nDivision in In re Savoy, J-4808-70, established detailed\nprocedures for disciplining children who are confined in District\nof Columbia juvenile detention facilities.  The defendants  ;\nsubsequently incorporated these procedures into Institutional\nCare Services Division Rule 4.12.\n  i\nm\n113. The defendants, however, have failed to take the steps j\nnecessary to ensure that these procedures are followed on a daily!\nbasis by the direct care staff of Oak Hill.  ¦\n114. In contravention of the standards established in In re '\nSavoy and Rule 4.12, the Oak Hill counselors frequently impose  ¦\npunishments without an adjudicatory hearing, impose periods of  !\nseclusion exceeding seven days for a single incident of\nmisbehavior, and impose \"group punishment\" of an entire unit for\nthe transgressions of a single resident of that unit.\n\n- 38 -\n115. All named plaintiffs were recently locked in their\nunits because some students had made noise in the school building\nearlier in the day.\nI.  Recreational Services\n116. The recreation program at Oak Hill consists of basket-\nball in the gymnasium, billiards in the cottage, and non-physical\nactivities such as television, movies and card games.  The Oak\nHill staff do not ensure that all the residents have an adequate\namount of daily major muscle activities.\n117. The defendants have failed to establish an adequate,\nstructured physical education program at Oak Hill.  Defendants\nfurthermore have failed to establish a program to teach leisure\ntime recreational activities such as music and crafts.\n118. Plaintiffs Vaun T. and Jerry M. spend their free time\nplaying cards or watching television.  The only major physical\nactivity in which they engage is an occasional basketball game in\nthe gymnasium.\nJ.  Procedures for Attorney-Client Communications\n119. In both their visitation policies and telephone\npolicies, defendants improperly interfere with residents' access\nto their attorneys.\n120. If an attorney wishes to meet with a detained client,\ndefendants will transport the child to the Receiving Home.  But\ndefendants have failed to establish sufficient interview rooms at\nthe Receiving Home.  As a result, attorneys frequently are unable ,\nto meet with their clients because all of the rooms are already\nfilled by other attorneys, probation officers, qr mental health\nprofessionals.\n121. Defendants have, moreover, adopted a policy of\n\n-  39  -\nprecluding  transportation  of  committed  residents  to  the  Receiving\nHome for  the  purpose  of  attorney-client  meetings.  Consequently,\n  an attorney  representing  a child  in  a post-commitment  proceeding\nA\n/  must  travel  to Laurel,  Maryland,  in  order  to  meet with  his  or  her\nclient.\n122.  The defendants  have  adopted  a policy  of  closing Oak\nHill's  telephone  switchboard  in  the  evenings,  and  thereby  :\nprecluding  any  calls  to  residents  during  these  hours.  The\ndefendants'  policy  severely  impairs  attorney-client\ncommunications  since  attorneys  who are  in  court  all  day  must use\nthe  evening  hours  to  call  clients.\nK.  Procedures  for  Family  Visitation\n123.  Like  at  Cedar Xnoll  (see paragraphs  77-7ö,  supra),  the\n¡\ndefendants  limit  their  provision  of  free  transportation  for\ncommitted  children's  parents  to  one day  a month.  Since  many of\nthe  children's  parents  are  impoverished  and  do not  own cars,  they\ncannot  travel  to Laurel  to  visit  their  children  on more than  this\nsingle  occasion  each  month.\n\n-  40  -\nIII.  Receiving Home\nA.  Physical  Structure\n124.  The  Receiving  Home is  a two-story,  red  brick  building\nlocated  at  1000 Mt.  Olivet  Road,  N.E.  in  the  District  of\nColumbia.  The doors  to  the  facility  are  always  locked  and  all\nthe  windows  have  bars  on them.  There  is  a small  outdoor  blacktop\nplayfield  on the  roof  of  the  building  which  is  surrounded  by a\nhigh  wire  fence.\n125.  The Receiving  Home for  Children  is  not  an  adequate\nsubstitute  for  a  child's  home.  The Receiving  Home is  \"'poorly\ndesigned  and  funcitonally  obsolete.\"1  D.C.  Crime  Commission\nReport  p.  675,  1966 cited  in  In  re  Savoy,  Green,  J.  Nov.  6,  1970\nMemorandum Opinion  at  p.  13.\n126.  The  space  at  the  Receiving  Home  is  not  sufficient  for\neither  proper  education  nor  for  proper  indoor  recreation.\nFunctionally  it  is  poorly  designed.\n127.  The kitchen  equipment  cannot  be properly  cleaned\nthereby  causing  problems  of  infestation  of  insects  and  other\nvermin.\n128.  The  rooms  and  dining  areas  are  uncomfortably  cold  and\ndo  not  provide  adequate  shelter  from  the  cold  during  the  winter.\n129.  There  are  not  enough  bathrooms  or  showers  for  all  the\nresidents  at  the  Receiving  Home when  it  is  operating  to  capacity,\nas  it  has  been  for  some  time.\n*  |\n130. Most of the children are housed in cells which measure\napproximately ten by seven feet in area.  Since these rooms do\n  ;\nnot have a commode or wash basin in them and remain inadvisably\npadlocked at all times, children needing to use the bathroom  j\nduring sleeping hours are forced to gain the attention of one of\nthe Receiving Home staff in order to be let out to use the  ¦\nbathroom.  Often children have had to wait to extended periods\n\n- 41 -\nof time before being allowed out to use the bathroom.  Moreover,\nthere is not enough privacy for the youngsters when they are able\nto get to the bathroom.\n131. Locked doors separate each of the units from each\nother and additional locked doors separate the recreation areas\nfrom the cells.  As a result, the area within which a detained or\ncommitted child is able to move freely is very limited.\n132. Children at the Receiving Home are not afforded\n; adequate time to take their showers.  In addition, in the boys'\nunit, the showers do not have curtains.  All the children at the •\nReceiving Home are forced to rush through their showers in one\nhour.  There need to be three shower facilities for each living\nunit.\n133. The fixtures and furnishings at the Receiving Home are\ndeteriorated.  The beds are made of metal slats which run\nperpendicular to one another.  The mattresses are very thin,\nthereby providing little protection from the hard metal of the\nbed frame.\n134. The utility services of the facility are not adequately\nmaintained or operated.  The heating and plumbing services are\nold and regularly overflow causing floodings.  The wire fixtures\ncovering many of the lights in the facility ace not tamper-\nresistant.  The conditions in some areas at the facility are in  :\nviolation of fire safety requirements.  Moreover, monthly fire\ndrills are not held, nor do the staff have access to keys which\n.would allow them to evacuate the building in an emergency-  Such\nan emergency occurred when a fire broke out during the spring  ·\nmonths of 19 85 and, due to the absence of keys, the Receiving  '\nHome was not evacuated prior to the arrival of the Fire  j\nDepartment.  The Washington, D.C. Fire Department does not review\nall the fire prevention and safety equipment.  ¦\n135. Plaintiff Tyra W. has been housed at the Receiving Home\nsince August, 1985.  Her room is often cold and she is unable to\n\n- 42 -\nregulate the heat in ht¿r cell.  She has often had to wait for\nlong periods of time to be let out of her cell to use the\nbathroom during sleeping hours.\nB.  Educational Services\n136. As stated in paragraphs 39 and 83, supra, the\nDepartment of Human Services has assumed the District of\nColumbia's responsiblity for providing educational services to\nchildren who are detained or committed in the District's\ndetention facilities, including the Receiving Home.\n137. The educational system at the Receiving Home is\ncompletely inadequate.  It lacks sufficient or qualified\nteachers, educational aides, and support services.  Not all of\nthose employed in an educational capacity have the qualifications\nrequired by the D.C. Public Schools.  Often students of widely\ndisparate abilities are together in a single class which,\ntogether with the other poor educational conditions, has caused\nmany of the teachers to abandon efforts to meet the students'\nneeds.\n138. Theoretically, there are classes at the Receiving Home\nin both the morning and the afternoon.  However, the afternoon\nclasses often begin late or are completely cancelled.  Teaching\nvacancies are not promptly filled.  Classes are often taught by\nconsultants or part-time staff who are not accountable to the\nReceiving Home and whose sporadic and intermitten,t appearance\nprovide no continuity for the children.  Thus, children housed at\nthe Receiving Home do not receive the five hours of daily\ninstruction required by law.\n139. Although at least eleven girls can be housed at the\nReceiving Home, there are not sufficient physical education\nactivities for them.  Moreover, since there is only one unit to\nhouse all the girls, regardless of age, the unit can house girls\nof diverse ages and, hence, abilities.  This situation presents\nneeds, as yet unmet, in the educational programming for girls.\n\n- 43 -\n140. The children at the Receiving Home do not receive an\neducational program which takes into consideration the unique\nnature of their situation and the extreme stress which they\nexperience.  The absence of individualized instruction and of\nsufficiently small learning modules fails to instill any self-\nesteem or sense of accomplishment in the children.  The\nevaluation system is not one which can be transferred to another\neducational setting.  It therefore hinders any continuity in the\nchildren's educational growth and development after they leave\nthe Receiving Home.\n141. As stated at paragraphs 42 and 83, supra, most of the\nchildren in the District's detention facilities, including the\nReceiving Home, are educationally handicapped and need special\neducation services.  Moreover, even among those children who do\nnot have such problems, there are many who require special\nattention based on their behavorial and adjustment problems in a\nschool setting.\n142. The Federal Education of the Handicapped Act entitles\nall educationally handicappped children to special education and\nrelated services.  This entitlement applies explicitly to\nchildren incarcerated in correctional facilities.  The law\nmandates that the District identify, evaluate, and provide\nspecial educational services to those children in its\ncorrectional facilities who are educationally handicapped.  The\nDistrict is not meeting its obligations in any of these three\nrequirements.  •\n143. The District fails to identify the handicapping\nconditions of the majority of educationally handicapped children\nat the Receiving Home, because the defendants do not properly\ntest or evaluate these children, do not obtain their educational\nrecords from the schools that the children attended prior to\ntheir incarceration, and do not employ persons trained or\nqualified to identify children with specific learning and ·\neducational handicaps.\n\n- 44 -\n144. The District violates its statutory duty to provide\nadequate and appropriate special educational services to all\neducationally handicapped children at the Receiving Home in that:\n/\n/  a.  Children who are truly educationally\n  handicapped, but have never been\nw\nidentified as such by the Receiving\nHome are foreclosed from special\n¦  educational services by being placed\nin classes with children who are not\neducationally handicapped.\nb.  Even when the Receiving Home does\nidentify a resident as educationally\nhandicapped, the deficiencies in the\neducation program prohibit the\nimplementation of an Individulized Edu-\ncational Plan that is appropriate for\nthe child's specific disabilities and\nneeds.\nc. - Defendants do not prepare a proper\nIndividualized Education Plan for any\nchild.  Moreover, even when defendants\nobtain such a plan, the services\nactually provided to the child do not\nfulfill the specifications of the\nplan and do not adequately serve the\nchild's special educational needs.\"\n¡!  There are no Receiving Home teachers\nwho are assigned the responsibility\nfor providing special education.\n145. In the course of evaluating and placing children,\nthe defendants fail to afford Receiving Home residents and\n\n-  45  -\ntheir  parents  the  procedural  rights  which  are  guaranteed by\nfederal  law.  Upon admitting  children  who were  in  special\neducation  classes  in  the  community,  the  facility  routinely\n/  changes  the  child's  educational  setting  to  a general  educational\n¡\nclass  without  notifying  the  child's  parents  of  the  change  in\neducational  placement  and their  right  to  contest  the  change.\nSince  defendants  fail  to  provide  any  special  education  whatsoever\nat  the  Receiving  Home,  they  are  in  direct  violation  of  the\n; substantive  and procedural  requirements  of  the  Federal  Education\nto  the  Handicapped  Act.\n146.  Plaintiff  Thurmon W. has  been deemed  in  need  of  special\neducation  due  to  his  emotional  problems  which  interfere  with  his\nlearning.  Since  his  incarceration,  however,  he has  received  no\nspecial  education  services  at  all.\n147.  Plaintiff  Tyra's  W.'s  proven  educational  disability  and\nemotional  disturbances  render  her  in  need  of  special  education.\nShe has  received  no appropriate  educational  services  during  her\nperiod  of  incarceration  at  the  Receiving Home.\nC.  Vocational  Training  Services\n148.  There  is  no vocational  training  at  the  Receiving Home\nat  all.  The residents  there  range  in  age  up to  19 years  old and\nsome  stay  at  the  Receiving  Home for  periods  of  time  far  exceeding\nsixty  days.  For  those  who had been  receiving  vocational  training\nin  the  community,  the  absence  of  any  vocational  opportunities  at\n,  the  Receiving  Home breaks  the  continuity  of  their  education,\n``¦  thwarts  the  progress  they  were making,  and hinders  their\nreadjustment  to  the  community.\n\n- 46 -\n149. Most of the detained and committed youths have few\nprospects for higher education, due to their educationally\ndeprived backgrounds.  They plan to enter the job market as\nquickly as possible and the complete dearth of vocational\nopportunities at the Receiving Home fails to fulfill any\nrehabilitative function of incarceration, leaving the young\npeople who re-enter the community from the Receiving Home without\nopportunities for a productive future.\nD.·  Mental Health Services\n150. The mental health personnel at the Receiving Home are\nprimarily the psychiatric nurse, a part-time psychiatrist, and a\nmental health specialist, who works only ten hours each week.\nThe facility needs an additional mental health specialist or\npsychiatric social worker.  Two nights of every week there are no\nmental health personnel to handle screenings of youngsters and\nthis work is left to a social worker.  Although three persons\nfrom the Youth Services Administration who had been at Cedar\nKnoll are now assigned to the Receiving Home, thus leaving Cedar\nKnoll without mental health personnel, the only psychiatric\nsocial worker available for individual counseling spends just\nthree hours a week providing individual counseling.  This means\nthat she is only available to three children each week and since\nshe continues to see those cnildren until they are no longer at\nthe Receiving Home, the number of individuals who have the\nbenefit of her services is very limited.\n151. Plaintiff Thurmon W. receives no counseling at all and\nplaintiff Tyra W. receives the counseling she does only because\nit is required by court order.\n\n- 47 -\nE.  Medical Services\nV  152. Defendants do not provide adequate medical care to the\nI  children at the Receiving Home.  There is no full-time phsycian\nor registered nurse at the Receiving Home twenty-four hours a\nday.  The counselors and other staff are not properly trained in\nfirst aid or how to deal with medical emergencies.  In addition,\n•¦ when a medical emergency arises, there are no adequate facilities\n:! or staff to quickly transport residents to proper medical care.\nF.  Counseling Services, Social Services\nand Direct Care\n153. The group leaders on each of the four units at the\nReceiving Home have the primary responsibility for direct care\nand supervision of the children on each unit.  Many of the staff\nat the Receiving Home work long and extended hours.  The result\nis an often exhausted staff who deal with problems in what they\nperceive to be the easiest way possible.  This is not always the\nmost productive manner of handling difficult situations.\nRelatedly, defendants physically restrain children at the\nReceiving Home by tying them to beds and other physical objects\nwithout the authorization of a medical doctor or the\nsuperintendent.  Moreover, there is no limit on the length of\ntime for which children are physically restrained and there is no\nprocedure requiring approval of physical restraints before they\nare utilized.\n154. Akin to defendants' use of physical restraints, is  '\ntheir practice of isolating children in their cells for extended ;\nperiods of time up to seven days for relatively minor\ninfractions.  Moreover, defendants do not maintain consistent\ndocumentation of the use of physical restraints and isolation,\nnor do they check those children who are restrained or in\nisolation with any reasonable degree of frequency.\n\n-  48 -\n155.  The social  workers  are  frequently  absent  and  the  group\nleaders  are  not  properly  trained  or  certified  to  provide  social\nwork  services.  Thus,  residents'  needs  are  often  inadequately\nassessed  and  arrangements  for  appropriate  services  are  frequently\nnot  made.  The staff  are  not  properly  supervised  nor  do they\nreceive  a consistent  program of  in-service  training.\n156.  While many of  the young people  housed  at  the  Receiving  .\n`  Home sufer  from  problems  of  drug  abuse  and drug  dependency,  the\n• ¦  limited  counseling  program  available  is  inadequate  to  meet  the\nneeds  of  those  residents  who need  drug  counseling  and  especially\nthose  in  need of  individual  drug  counseling.  ;\n157.  Plaintiff  Tyra W. lives  in  a unit  from  which  the\nassigned  social  worker  is  frequently  absent..  Thus,  many of  her  i\nneeds  and problems  go unaddressed.  Moreover,  because  that  worker\nhas  no formal  training  or  degree  in  social  work or  counseling,\nand  is  not  professionally  equipped  to  deal  with  Tyra's  severe\nemotional  problems,  even when he  is  present,  Tyra  is  not  ;\nreceiving  the  appropriate  services  or  counseling  she needs.\nG.  Climate  of  Violence\n158.  There  is  a  \"climate  of  violence\"  which pervades  the\ndaily  lives  of  the  young people  incarcerated  at  the  Receiving\nHome.  This  atmosphere  is  due  to\na.  The  inadequate  training  and  supervision\nof  the  staff  resulting  in  a situation  in\n¦.  which  staff  periodically  commit physical\n!  assaults  upon the  children  at  the\n1  -  Receiving  Home; and\nb.  The staff's  inadequate  supervision  of  the\nchildren  at  the  Receiving Home which\nallows  for  an environment  in which\ntensions  build  and residents  assault\neach  other.\n\n- 49 -\n159. Separate and apart from the physical injuries caused by\nthe foregoing acts, omissions, and policies of defendant,\nresidents at the Receiving Home also suffer psychological injury\nto all the youngsters who witness these assaults and live in\nconstant fear of being injured.  As of the filing of this amended\ncomplaint there were allegations of three separate incidents in\nwhich different staff members allegedly raped female residents\nduring the autumn of 1985.\n160. Plaintiff Tyra W. was the victim of physical and verbal\nabuse by a staff member at the Receiving Home in September, 1985.\nAccording to a report written by another staff member, the\nassaultive behavior came from someone who had been using vulgar,\ninflammatory, and derogatory language towards Tyra.  Moreover,  ••\nTyra was threatened with a knife and all the pictures in her cell\nwere torn off the walls by the staff person.  ;\nH.  Recreational Services\n161. There are not sufficient full-time recreation staff for\nthe youngsters at the Receiving Home.  The recreational program  ¦\nat the Receiving Home consists of a limited number of activities\navailable in the units and in the recreation room.  In addition,\nthere is a limited amount of outdoor activity available on small\nblacktop surfaces.  These limitations are due, in part, to the\ndesign and structural inadequacy of the facility itself.  The\nblacktop surfaces are not enclosed and thus are useless during\ncold and/or inclement weather.  This means that the children  ';\nremain indoors continuously for months at a time.  There are no <,\ni\nmajor muscle activities or organized intramural games or  '\nactivities for the children.  Thus, idleness is a great problem, ¡\npaticularly because the limited activities available to the  ¡\nchildren are sedentary.  Moreover, the defendants have not  :\nestablished a program to teach leisure time recreational  j\ni\nactivities such as music and crafts.\n\n- 50 -\n162. Plaintiff Tyra W. spends much of her time watching\ntelevision or playing cards, or board games.\n*·  Procedures for Attorney-Client Conununications\n163. In both their telephone and their visitation policies,\ndefendants improperly interfere with attorneys' access to their\nclients.\n164. Since the Receiving Home is used for attorney-client\nvisits with children incarcerated at Oak Hill and Cedar Knoll\n(see paragraphs 74 and 120, supra) as well as for interviews by\nprobation officers and others, attorneys are often unable to meet\nwith their clients because all the rooms are already filled.\nFurthermore, since the space at the Receiving Home is so limited,\ndefendants frequently curtail the number and length of attorney  \\\nvisits.\n165. Moreover, defendants' telephone policy precludes easy\naccess to residents during the evening hours.  This policy\nseverely hinders the attorney-client relationship sicne attorneys\nwho are in court all day must call their clients in the evening. •\n166. Plantiff Tyra W.'s attorney had difficulty visiting her\nwhen she and her attorney were forced to share an interview room\nwith others because the only other interview room was being used\nto detain a child for whom there was no other space.\nJ.  Procedures for Disciplining Residents\n167. In an Order issued on November 3, 1976, the Family  |\nDivision in In re Savoy, J-4808-70, established detailed  j\nprocedures for disciplining children who are confined in District\nof Columbia juvenile detention facilities.  The defendants  ¡\nsubsequently incorporated these procedures into Institutional  ¡\nCare Services Division Rule 4.12.  ¡\n¡\n168. The defendants, however, have failed to take the steps \\\nnecessary to ensure that these procedures are followed on a daily '•\nbasis by the direct care staff of the Receiving Home.\n\n- 51 -\n169. In contravention of the standards established in In re\nSavoy and Rule 4.12, the children incarcerated at the Receiving\nHome are often subject to arbitrary and severe punishment far\nbeyond any justifiable response to a given infraction.  Children\nare locked in their cells for lengthy periods of time and\npunishments are imposed without an adjudicatory hearing being\nheld.  Moreover, \"group punishments\" have been imposed on an\nentire unit when only a single child misbehaves.\nK.  Procedures for Family Visitation\n170. The space available at the Receiving Home for family\nvisits is antithetical to fostering positive, growing, and\nnuturing relationships between the children incarcerated and\ntheir families.  The space is inadequate and precludes frequent\nvisits from as many families as possible.  Frequent and\nproductive visits are vital to encouraging positive development\nin the relationship between an incarcerated child and his or her\nfamily, clearly a critical component to any rehabilitative\nprocess for young people.\n171. Moreover, there are no consistent provisions made for\nyoungsters who do not have family to visit them.  Families must\ncall to arrange for visits with their children and are often\nunable to see them at times convenient to them because of the\nlimited space at the Receiving Home.\n*\nIV.  Systemic Allegations\n172. Many detained and committed youngsters at all three\nfacilities, Oak Hill, Cedar Knoll, and the Receiving Home, are\nplaced inappropriately and are subjected to environments\n\n- 52 -\nunnecessarily secure for their needs which inherently impair\ntheir statutory right to be in as homelike a setting as possible.\nThe secure detention in which many of the children are placed is\n/  not necessary for the protection of the public and is\ninconsistent with their rehabilitative and custodial needs.\n173. According to recent statistics, the District of\nColumbia has the highest rate of incarceration of juveniles in\n¦- training schools of any jurisdiction in the nation.  Even so,\nmany children confined in these three secure facilities pose no\nthreat to the public and are incarcerated for non-violent\noffenses.  Professional staff and experts alike agree that such\nsecure detention is not appropriate or necessary for many of\nthese youngsters.\n174. There are lengthy waiting lists of children who have\nbeen deemed eligible for 'and in need of less secure and\nrestrictive settings such as youth shelter houses, youth group\nhomes, home detention, and residential placements.  However,\ndefendant officials provide insufficient facilities, staff and\nresources in order to place many of the children in these more\nappropriate and less restrictive settings in a timely fashion or\nat all.\n175. District officials fail to evaluate the needs of the\nindividual children in terms of their placement in these\ninstitutions initially when the decision is in their discretion\nand fail to provide adequate follow-up and periodic reviews to\nensure that children are not being placed in overly secure\nsettings which may be inconsistent with their custody and\ntreatment needs and with the protection of the public.\n\n- 53 -\nCAUSES OF ACTION\n176. With respect to each of the following Counts,\nplaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all of the\nallegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 175.\nCOUNT I\n177. The totality of the conditions in the District of\nColumbia juvenile detention facilities, including the physical\nstructures, programs, practices and policies, violates detained\nand committed children's rights, under the laws of the District\nof Columbia, to appropriate care and treatment.  The totality of\nconditions also violates these children's statutory rights to an\nappropriate education under the laws of the District of Columbia\nand the laws of the united States, their right to rehabilitative\ntreatment under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nand their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights to be free from harm,\nunnecessary restraint, and cruel and unusual punishment.\nCOUNT II\n178. Defendants have failed to provide detained and\ncommitted children confined in District of Columbia detention\nfacilities with suitable and adequate educational services, in\nviolation of these children's statutory rights to appropriate\ncare and treatment under D.C. Code SS 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as\ninterpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2), their statutory right to\neducation under D.C. Code § 31-401, and their rig¾ts under the\nFifth and Eighth Amendments.  In failing to provide adequate and\nappropriate special education and related services, defendants\nhave furthermore violated the substantive and procedural\nrequirements of the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C.\nS 1401 et seq.), D.C. Code §§ 31-401, and 403, and the Fifth and\nEighth Amendments.\n\n-  54  -\n179.  By  failinq  to  provide  adequate  medical  services  and\nadequate  mental  health  services  to  the  detained  and  committed\nresidents  of  juvenile  detention  facilities,  defendants  have\nviolated  these  children's  statutory  rights  to  appropriate  care\nand  treatment  under  D.C.  Code  S§  16-2313(b)  and  16-2320  (as\ninterpreted  in  SCR-Juv.  Rule  2),  their  right  to  \"related\nservices\"  under  the  Education  of  the  Handicapped  Act  (20  U.S.\nS  1401  et  seq.),  their  Fifth  and  Eighth  Amendment  rights  to  be\nfree  from  harm  and  cruel  and  unusual  punishment,  and  their  Fifth\nAmendment  right  to  rehabilitative  treatment.\nCOUNT IV\n180.  By  failing  to  provide  humane  and  safe  living\nconditions  in  the  juvenile  detention  facilities,  defendants  have\nviolated  detained  and  committed  children's  rights  to  appropriate\ncare  and  treatment  under  D.C.  Code  SS  16-2313(b)  and  16-2320  (as\ninterpreted  in  SCR-Juv.  Rule  2),  their  Fifth  and Eighth  Amendment\nrights  to  be  free  from  harm  and  cruel  and  unusual  punishment,  and\ntheir  Fifth  Amendment  right  to  rehabilitative  treatment.\nCOUNT V\n181. The defendants' failure to provide adequate vocational\ntraining services, counseling and social services, and\nrecreational services, and their failure to provide adequate\nmeans for parental visitation violates detained and committed\nchildren's rights to appropriate care and treatment under D.C.\nCode §S 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as interpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule\n2), their right to \"related services\" under the Education of the\nHandicapped Act (20 U.S.C. § 1401 et seq.), their Fifth and\nEighth Amendment  rights to be free from harm and cruel and\nunusual treatment, and their Fifth Amendment due process right to\nrehabilitative treatment.\n\n- 55 -\nCOUNT VI\n182. The defendants' failure to provide adequate facilities\nfor attorneys' communications with and visits with children\ny\nconfined in District of Columbia juvenile detention facilities\nviolates these children's Fifth Amendment due process right to\naccess to the courts and legal assistance.\n;  COUNT VII  .\n!•  ~¯¯¯~¯^¯~~¯¯¯\njí  183. The climate of violence prevailing in District of\nColumbia juvenile detention facilities (including direct\ncounselor abuse of residents and counselors' failure to protect\nresidents from other residents) and the excessive and improper \\\nuse of seclusion and other disciplinary sanctions violates\ndetained and committed children's rights to appropriate care and ¦\ntreatment under D.C. Code §S 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as  :\ninterpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2), their Fifth Amendment due  ;\nprocess rights to receive adequate treatment and to be\nsafeguarded from summary punishment, and their Eighth Amendment\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\nCOUNT VIII\n184. The defendants' failure to evaluate, determine, and\nreview plaintiffs adequately in order to place them in\nappropriate facilities consistent with plaintiffs' treatment\nneeds and defendants' failure to afford confinement in the least\nrestrictive settings consistent with the childre¾s1 treatment and\nj\n!;  rehabilitative  needs  violates  plaintiffs'  Fifth  Amendment due\nl\nprocess rights under the U.S. Constitution and their statutory\nright to custody care and discipline in settings as nearly as\npossible like that which should have been provided by their\nparents under D.C. Code S 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as interpreted\nin SCR-Juv. Rule 2.)\n\n- 56 -\nRELIEF REQUESTED\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for the following relief:\n1.  That this Court determine, pursuant to Rules 23 and\n| 23-1 of the Superior Court Ruyles of Civil Procedure, that this\nI\naction is a proper class action and that plaintiffs are proper\nclass representatives;\n2.

The necessity of amending the complaint arose\nafter several of plaintiffs' experts, upon touring the three\nfacilities (pursuant to Superior Court Rule 34 of Civil\nProcedure), discovered excessive and unwarranted incarceration of\nchildren who should not be institutionalized in any of the three\nfacilities at issue and learned of inadequate assessment and\ntreatment by defendants of the needs of the children entrusted to\ndefendants' care and custody.\nSignificantly, defense counsel was present on all of the\nexperts' tours during which said experts expressed their concern\nover these issues.  Thus, defendants have had notice of these\nareas of concern for over a month.  Moreover, it is significant\nthat these amendments do not represent a substantive change in\nthe nature of this action and that defendants, as of the filing\nof this motion, have yet to answer the amended complaint filed on\nJanuary 15, 1986.\n\n- 2 -\nThe rule permitting amendment of a pleading is to be\nliberally applied.  Eagle Wine and Liquor Co., et al. v.\nSilverberg Electric Company, 402 A.2d 31, 34 (D.C. Ct. App. 1979)\nV  (there should be a \"prevailing spirit of liberalism in allowing\n;  ... amendments when justice will be so served\").  See also,\nHartford Accident and Indemnity Company v. District of Columbia,\net al., 441 A.2d 969 (D.C. Ct. App. 1982).  Leave to amend a\npleading, even after a responsive pleading has been filed, is\ngenerally \"freely given\" since \"this jurisdiction favors\nresolution of controversies on their merits.\"  Gordon v. Raven\nSystems and Research, Inc., 462 A.2d 10, 13 (D.C. Ct. App. 1979)\n(when suit against the District of Columbia has afforded Mayor\ntimely notice of suit and circumstances manifesting an intention\nto sue the city, the Court should permit amendment of the\npleadings consistent with that notice).  See also, Epps v. Vogel,\n454 A.2d 320 (D.C. Ct. App. 1982); Keith v. Washington, 401 A.2d\n468 (D.C. Ct. App. 1969).\nIn the instant case defendants were aware of plaintiffs'\nintentions over one month ago based on expert tours which have\nbeen taking place since the end of January, 1986, the most recent\nof which did not take place until the end of March, 1986.\nMoreover, the need to add language referring to utilization of\nthe least restrictive alternative, greater availability of\nalternatives to incarceration, and more frequent, accurate, and\ndetailed assessments of the needs of the population in each of\nthe three institutions at issue, only arose after plaintiffs'\nexperts toured the three facilities and it became apparent that\nthese aspects of the conditions at each of the three facilities\nneeded to be addressed.\nAbsent bad faith, undue delay, dilatory tactics, or undue\nprejudice to the opposing party, leave to amend a pleading is to\nbe granted where \"justice so requires.\"  Blake Construction Co.,\nInc. v. Alliance Plumbing and Heating, 388 A.2d 1217, 1220 (D.C.\n\n- 3 -\nCt. App. 1978) cert, denied, 440 U.S. 911 (1979).  See also,\nGordon v. Raven Systems and Research, Inc., supra, 462 A.2d at\n13 (D.C. Ct. App. 1983) (factors to be considered in determining\nwhether to grant leave to amend a pleading include \"the length\nof the pendency of the proceedings, [and] the existence of bad\nfaith or dilatory motive, [and] prejudice to the opposing\nparty\"); Bennett v. Fun and Fitness of Silver Hill, 434 A.2d 476\n(D.C. Ct. App. 1981).\nIn the instant case any arguable delay in amending the\ncomplaint has not been due to dilatory tactics on plaintiffs'\npart, \\J nor has it been caused by plaintiffs' bad faith.\nMoreover, the delay has not been lengthy given the chronology of\nthe case and the fact that defendants have not even answered\nthe amended complaint filed on January 15, 1986.  Finally, no\nprejudice is caused defendants by amending the complaint at this\ntime since the amendments do not entail substantive charges, but\nmerely re-phrase the terms in which the complaint is set\nforth. 2/\nAs stated by the Supreme Court,\n\"Leave to amend 'shall be freely given when\njustice so requires1; . . ..  If the\nunderlying facts or circumstances relied\nupon by a plaintiff may  be a proper\nsubject of relief, he ought to be afforded\nan opportunity to test his claim  on the\nmerits.  In the absence of any apparent\nor declared reason —  such as undue delay,\nbad faith or dilatory motive on the part of\nthe movant, repeated failure to cure\ndeficiencies by amendments previously\nallowed, undue prejudice to the opposing\n\\J  As explained, supra, it was only through the expert tours\nbetween the end of January and the end of March, 1986, that\nthe three concerns plaintiffs seek to address by their\namended complaint came to the fore.\n2/  The amended complaint differs from the amended complaint\nfiled on January 15, 1986 in the following limited ways:\na) the last sentence of paragraph 1 on page •seven (7) is\nnew; b) paragraphs 172 through 175  are new; c) Count VIII\non page 55 is new; d) paragraph 1, on page 58 is new.\n\n- 4 -\nparty by virtue of allowance of the\namendment, futility of amendment, etc.\n—  the leave sought should, as the rules\nrequire, be 'freely given.1  Of course,\nthe grant or denial of an opportunity to\namend is within the discretion of the . . .\nCourt, but outright refusal to grant the\nleave without any justifying reason\nappearing for the denial is not an exercise\nof discretion; it is merely abuse of that\ndiscretion and inconsistent with the spirit\nof the . . . Rules.\"\nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962), quoting Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 15(a). 3/\nWHEREFORE, for all the aforementioned reasons, any others\nwhich may appear at a full hearing on this matter, and any\nothers which this Court deems just and proper, Plaintiffs\nrespectfully request that this Honorable Court grant this Motion\nand allow Plaintiffs to amend the Complaint.\nV  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) is identical to\nSCR-Civil 15(a), except that the latter contains an\nadditional sentence specifying a time limit, after the\nfiling of a responsive pleading, within which an amended\npleading must be filed.

Smith, Jr., Special Deputy Corporation Counsel, with whom John M. Ferren, Corporation\nCounsel at the time the brief was filed, and Richard S. Love, Special Counsel, were on the brief, for appellants.\nRobert L. Wilkins, Public Defender Service, with whom James W. Klein and David A. Reiser, Public Defender\nService and Donna Wulkan, were on the brief, for appellees.\nDaniel A. Rezneck, Washington, DC, filed a brief on behalf of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility\nand Management Assistance Authority as amicus curiae.\nBefore WAGNER, Chief Judge, and TERRY, Associate Judge, and KERN, Senior Judge.\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellants, the District of Columbia (District) and the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), challenge an\norder of the trial court appointing a receiver for education at the Oak Hill Youth Center, a facility maintained by the\nDistrict for the treatment and rehabilitation of detained and committed children. The question presented by this\nappeal is whether the trial court erred in granting this extraordinary remedy. While the District's history of\ncompliance with the orders of the court leaves much to be desired, we are not persuaded that the record reveals\na sufficient basis for the imposition of this remedy of last resort under the circumstances existing at the time of\nthe entry of the order, and therefore, we reverse and remand.\nI. Procedural and Factual Background\n1208 This case has a long and unfortunate history. It was commenced in 1985 when *1208 Jerry M., representing a\nclass of detained and committed children confined at the District's facilities for juveniles, filed suit against the\n[1]\nDistrict and various District officials  contending that they had failed \"to provide appropriate care, rehabilitation,\nand treatment to them in violation of the Constitution and the District of Columbia Code.\" Jerry M., supra note 1,\n571 A.2d at 180. On July 24, 1986, the parties entered into a Consent Decree which was approved by the court\n[2]\nand entered as a judgment.  The Consent Decree provided, among other critical matters, for \"minimum\nstandards for staffing and training, improvements in diagnostic services, treatment planning through individual\nservice plans (ISP) and Team leaders, as well as education, recreational, and mental health services and medical\nservices\" in the District's facilities. Id. at 181 (footnote omitted). Section IV(H) of the Consent Decree, Education\nand Vocational Programming, provided for the number of educational personnel to be employed, including a\nprincipal and assistant principal, certification requirements for teachers, specified student-teacher ratios,\nacademic subjects approximating those available in the D.C. public schools, adequate equipment, materials and\nresources, and classroom placement according to individual ability. Various deadlines were set for\nimplementation of each of these actions, with the latest to be completed by September 1, 1987. Pursuant to the\nConsent Decree, a Monitor was appointed to make findings and recommendations \"concerning the steps to be\ntaken to achieve compliance [with the Consent Decree].\" Id. In addition, the Consent Decree established a panel\nof three experts to \"determine the appropriate number of juveniles in need of secure confinement in the District\n\nand to develop a system for appropriate care, services, and placement of securely confined juveniles in YSA\n[3]\ncustody.\" Id.\nIn the years following entry of the Consent Decree, the DCPS had responsibility for the educational program at\nthe Receiving Home, while DHS and the YSA were responsible for the programs at Oak Hill and Cedar Knoll.\nReports of the Court Monitor show that the school at the Receiving Home was generally in compliance with\neducational requirements. However, the court entered several orders reflecting that the schools at Oak Hill and\nCedar Knoll were not in compliance with the educational requirements of the Consent Decree. For example,\nthere was no substitute teacher roster or adequate equipment and supplies at Oak Hill School in 1986. The\nsubstitute teacher problem and inadequacy of books and supplies persisted in 1987, and cancellation and\ncurtailment of school days occurred without reasonable justification. There were other violations in 1988,\n1209 including an improper student-teacher *1209 ratio, lack of a substitute teacher roster, inadequate supplies, and\nviolations of the special education requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1401 et seq. In a report to the court filed on March 7, 1989, the Monitor reported that despite some\nimprovements at Oak Hill, many children were not assigned to classes according to abilities, some staff positions\nwere not filled, and there was still no substitute teacher roster and no meaningful vocational program. In a report\nsubmitted to the court in 1990, the Monitor reported that in spite of efforts to assist with compliance, Oak Hill\nSchool did not have enough special education teachers, lacked a substitute teacher roster, had teachers not\ncertified in their area of specialization, and maintained an inadequate vocational education program. A contempt\norder was entered related to deficiencies in 1991. Some improvements were noted in 1992, but there were still\ndeficiencies in connection with supplies, vocational education, timeliness of assessments, and special education\nprovisions. In 1993, there were IDEA violations, inadequate teacher certification, inadequate books, equipment\nand supplies. In 1995, there were problems with children failing to attend classes and an insufficient number of\nteachers and substitute teachers, and noncompliance with special education requirements continued.\nA different judge was assigned to the case who requested a report from the Monitor's expert, Dr. Leone, and the\ncourt requested appellants to develop a plan to respond, focusing on education. Many of the teachers at the\nschool were not adequately certified, and a new curriculum had not been implemented as promised. In March\n1996, appellants announced their intention to secure the services of the Richard Milburn High School (RMHS) to\nrun the educational programs at the Oak Hill School beginning with the 1996-97 school year. However, RMHS did\nnot commence operation of the school until November 6, 1996, because the contract for services was not signed\nuntil mid-October of that year. Teachers were issued reduction-in-force (RIF) notices in anticipation of the\ntransition to contract services. This created problems, which were reported by the Monitor as follows:\nFrom the day of the RIF notices, the educational program fell to pieces, with teachers using sick\nleave to look for new jobs or just refusing to come to work, coming in late and leaving early, and\nspending on-the-job time complaining about the unfairness of the RIF. Records were not kept;\nthere were no special education referrals to the DCPS Diagnostic and Placement team for Oak\nHill; diagnostic evaluations were not done, so placement of students in classes was based on little\nmore than intuition; and students were allowed to wander the grounds almost at will.\nAt an emergency hearing, DCPS placed on the record its reasons for the position that it was not responsible for\nassisting YSA during the transition to privatization. The court ordered DCPS to provide Oak Hill with fourteen\ncertified teachers, including two in special education, by September 16, 1996, and DCPS complied. According to\nthe Monitor, \"[t]he addition of DCPS teachers made the difference between holding school and not holding it.\"\nBy Order dated June 24, 1997, the trial court appointed a Special Master to \"assist the [appellants] in identifying\nand correcting deficiencies in the provision of educational services required by the Consent Decree.\" In\nappointing the Special Master, the trial court stated that it sought to \"initiate the process of judicial action with an\n[4]\neffort of minimal intrusiveness to assist, not take over, [appellants'] duties under the Consent Decree.\"  The trial\n1210 court *1210 found, inter alia, that (1) \"despite the assistance of the Monitor and the Monitor's experts, and in the\nface of the Court's remedial Orders I and K, [appellants] have never achieved compliance with the educational\nrequirements of the Consent Decree\"; (2) the \"appellants have demonstrated an inability to achieve and sustain\ncompliance with the Consent Decree and the Court's remedial orders regarding educational services. Moreover,\nthe Court is convinced that the `lack of communication and cooperation' ... is likely to recur without Court\n\nintervention\"; (3) the appellants \"conced[ed] substantial non-compliance on educational issues\" following a\nhearing on [appellees'] motion for contempt held on May 9, 1997, foregoing the defense of impossibility of\nperformance; and (4) \"[t]here is no factual dispute as to whether the Court has sufficient evidence to find\ndefendants in contempt for violation of the Consent Decree.\" Among the duties conferred upon the Special\nMaster were the following:\nIn Phase One, the duty of the Special Master shall be to use the powers enumerated below to aid\n[appellants'] compliance with the educational provisions of the Consent Decree. Phase Two of the\nSpecial Master's duties will become operational only if the Court concludes that [appellants] have\nfailed to achieve substantial compliance with the educational provisions of the Consent Decree by\nDecember 1, 1997.\nWhile Phase One powers essentially involved the preparation of an educational implementation plan and\nmonitoring appellants' compliance with the plan, Phase Two powers gave the Special Master the authority to\nimplement the plan developed in Phase One.\nIn the First Report to the trial court, the Special Master referenced the \"`Commitment [of the District of Columbia\nPublic Schools (DCPS)] to Providing Services to Special Education Students at Richard Milburn High School' at\nOak Hill, signed on September 25, 1997, by the Acting Executive Director of the Special Education Division of\n[5]\nDCPS.\"  After receiving this Report, the trial court issued Order 12, dated October 8, 1997, establishing court-\nordered deadlines. Order 12 \"incorporated the tasks, target dates and person(s) responsible noted in the [Special\nMaster's] First Report [to the trial court].\" Thereafter, the Special Master submitted several reports to the trial\ncourt indicating some areas of continued noncompliance.\nIn anticipation of the 1998-99 academic school year, the District announced its desire to permit DCPS to run the\nOak Hill School. On May 12, 1998, after hearing presentations from the newly appointed Superintendent of\nDCPS, Ms. Arlene Ackerman, and the Director for Alternative Placement, Dr. Ira Thomas, the trial court permitted\nDCPS to develop a plan for running Oak Hill in compliance with the \"Consent Decree, the implementing orders\nissued by Judge Urbina and this Court, and all federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements.\" In early\nJune 1998, DCPS presented its plan to run the Oak Hill School to the Special Master for review. The trial court\n[6]\napproved the plan over appellees' objection.\nOn July 13, 1998, the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority\n1211 (Authority) approved Management Directive No. 98-1 *1211 (Directive).[7] At the core of the Directive \"was the\ncentralization of power in the DCPS Director of the Alternative Education Program (Director).\" The Authority\ndirected the Director, inter alia, \"to identify highly qualified, certified teachers, with proper credentials for services\nat [the Oak Hill Youth Center (OHYC)], and the Superintendent of Schools shall appoint them, no later that\nAugust 19, 1998 [to satisfy certain teacher-student ratios]....\" The Authority also ordered the Director to \"appoint a\nPrincipal and Assistant Principal for OHYC no later than July 15, 1998.\" In addition, the Directive: (1) authorized\nthe termination of teachers and employees who failed to meet established performance standards; (2) ordered\nthe implementation of a curriculum-based assessment system for placement decisions, and ordered the\ninstallation of \"sufficient computers with software necessary to implement the curriculum utilized at OHYC\" to be\nin place by the beginning of the 1998 fall semester; (3) mandated that all books and supplies be available for use\n[8]\nby August 24, 1998,  (4) charged the Director with coordinating with DCPS Division of Special Education \"to\nensure the provision of timely and current special education assessments and all related services identified in\neach child's IEP\"; (5) directed the Director to \"ensure that YSA unit staff and [Youth Corrections Officers (YCOs)]\nreceive training to act as teacher's aides during the school day and tutors during the evenings and weekends\";\n(6) directed the Director of DHS and the YSA to hire \"[a]n education specialist ... to coordinate and monitor the\nprovision of education services at OHYC\"; and (7) directed the heads of District of Columbia agencies \"to work\nwith DHS and DCPS or face `corrective action' by the authority.\"\nOn August 17, 1998, the Assistant to the Special Master sent a Memorandum to the Director \"to express her\nconcerns about certain personnel, resource and training issues relating to the then-forthcoming commencement\n[9]\nof school at Oak Hill, scheduled to begin in two weeks.\"  The Memorandum discussed \"the failure of DCPS to\n\nextend employment offers to the teachers.\" The Memorandum further noted \"the lack of employment of special\neducation assistants and a special education coordinator.\" Finally, the Memorandum questioned the plans DCPS\n\"had for training the YCOs for their new assistant/tutor roles.\" Appellees filed a Motion to Appoint a Receiver for\nEducation on September 3, 1998.\nIn considering appellees' Motion to Appoint a Receiver For Education, the trial court concluded that it \"[r]egretfully\n... finds itself in the same position it was in June, 1997, insofar as examining a factual record that establishes\nnumerous violations of the Consent Decree, implementing orders and applicable statutory provisions.\"\nMore specifically, the trial court found that: (1) appellants failed to ensure that teachers received competency-\nbased training in the use of the curriculum by the commencement of the 1998-99 academic school year as\nmandated by the Consent Decree, Order 12 and the Management Directive; (2) as of September 4, 1998,\nappellants were out of compliance with their duty to hire DCPS-certified teachers as mandated by the Consent\n1212 Decree;[10]*1212 (3) appellants failed to purchase supplies adequate to meet students' needs as mandated by\nthe Consent Decree, Order 12, and the Directive; (4) appellants were out of compliance with regard to completing\nspecial educational evaluations by established deadlines as set forth in the Consent Decree; (5) appellants'\nability to provide special education services were \"woefully inadequate,\" in violation of the Consent Decree; (6)\nappellants stipulated that \"individualized curriculum-based assessment is not currently in use\" in violation of the\nConsent Decree and Order 12; (7) appellants had not implemented a teacher compensation program, nor had it\nappointed teachers as required by Order 12 and the Directive; and, (8) appellants stipulated that \"they presently\ndo not have a roster of substitute teachers\" as required by the Consent Decree and Order K. The trial court found\nthat the appellees had established these violations by a preponderance of the evidence.\nUpon consideration of the previously mentioned reports from the Special Master, and after concluding \"that there\nis no alternative, as yet untried,\" the trial court appointed a receiver to assume \"ultimate control over the\neducation system at Oak Hill ....\" To this end, the trial court intended for the receiver to \"act to implement the\nManagement Directive and any other steps necessary to achieve a quality education program at Oak Hill through\noversight and control of DCPS, YSA and DHS personnel.\" In appointing the receiver, the trial court left in place\n\"many of the individuals who have labored on behalf of the [appellants] up until now ... hold[ing] these individuals\nfrom DCPS, YSA and DHS to the representations they have been making for months regarding their commitment\nto the youth at Oak Hill.\" \"[T]he Court want[ed the appellants] to be partners in this endeavor and to be achievers,\nnot obstructers.\" The power granted to the receiver was to,\nabsent further court order, extend through the current 1998-99 academic year, including summer\nschool for 1999. Prior to the end of this period, the Receiver may petition the Court to terminate\nthe receivership if the Defendants demonstrate the capability to operate the Oak Hill school in a\n[11]\nmanner that provides a quality education and complies with all legal requirements.\nOn September 25, 1998, appellants filed a timely notice of appeal of the receivership order. On October 23, 1998,\nappellants filed a Motion to Stay Receivership Order, which was subsequently denied by Order 15 on November\n19, 1998.\nII.\nOn appeal, appellants argue that the trial court erred in appointing a receiver \"[j]ust days after the beginning of\nthe new school year and before the recently-appointed School Superintendent had a fair opportunity to make\nmeaningful improvements at the District's Oak Hill Youth Center.\" Furthermore, appellants contend that the trial\ncourt \"took this action only eight weeks after Superintendent Ackerman had courageously agreed to assume full\nresponsibility for a troubled program that other public and private entities had for 12 years failed to remedy.\" They\ncontend that the trial court \"took this action even though Superintendent Ackerman had begun to make significant\nprogress at the facility, and [the trial court] took it notwithstanding that [it] had given the Superintendent no notice\nthat [it] intended to judge her based on conditions during the first week of school.\"\nIn summary, appellants contend that the trial court did not and could not conclude, within the first\n1213 week of school, that Ms. Ackerman was incapable of providing effective leadership; was unable\n\n*1213or unwilling to carry out her responsibilities; and that there was no reasonable prospect for\nprogress at Oak Hill within a reasonable time. Moreover, in transferring the Superintendent's\nauthority to [its] own appointees, [the trial court] ignored the principle of deference to local\nauthority, which is at its zenith concerning local control over the operation of the public schools.\nFurthermore, [the trial court] refused to avail [itself] of less drastic, more narrowly tailored\nremedies which were specifically suggested by [appellants] and were obviously available to\naddress any shortcoming [the trial court] found.\nThe court has the power, pursuant to its equity jurisdiction, to take broad remedial action to secure compliance\nwith its orders, including the power to appoint a receiver. See Dixon v. Barry, 967 F.Supp. 535, 550 (D.D.C.1997)\n(citing Morgan v. McDonough, 540 F.2d 527, 533 (1st Cir.1976) (other citations omitted)). \"[C]ourts have\nappointed receivers to protect constitutional and statutory rights in a variety of circumstances.\" Id. (citing Morgan,\n540 F.2d at 533) (other citation omitted); see also LaShawn A., by Moore v. Barry, 330 U.S.App. D.C. 204, 210,\n144 F.3d 847, 853 (1998). Receivers have been appointed \"to coerce public officials to comply with legal\nmandates in a number of factual settings, including public schools, housing, highways, nursing homes, and\nprisons.\" Dixon, 967 F.Supp. at 550. The appointment of a receiver to act in the place of \"elected and appointed\nofficials is an extraordinary step warranted only by the most compelling circumstances.\" Morgan, 540 F.2d at 535.\nEssentially it is the remedy of last resort, and therefore, should be undertaken only when absolutely necessary. \nLaShawn A.,330 U.S.App. D.C. at 211, 144 F.3d at 854. In determining whether other remedies are inadequate\nand receivership remains the only viable option to effectuate compliance with the laws and orders of the court,\nthe court should consider a number of factors. These include: (1) \"whether there were repeated failures to comply\nwith the Court's orders\"; (2) whether further efforts to secure compliance would only lead to \"confrontation and\ndelay\"; (3) whether leadership is available which can \"turn the tide within a reasonable time period\"; (4) \"whether\nthere was bad faith\"; (5) \"whether resources are being wasted\"; and, (6) \"whether a receiver can provide a quick\nand efficient remedy.\" Dixon, 967 F.Supp. at 550 (citing Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. v. Commissioner of\nDep't of Mental Retardation, 424 Mass. 430, 677 N.E.2d 127, 148-49 (1997), and Morgan, 540 F.2d at 533).\nIn this case, the trial court relied principally upon only one of the factors essential for a reasonable exercise of its\ndiscretion to impose this extraordinary remedy. It focused upon the history of the District's failure to comply fully\nwith the court's requirements. The District's abysmal response to its mandates for such a protracted period of\ntime, as the trial court found, is a compelling consideration; however, it is not the only one. If that were the only\nfactor for consideration, it would present a compelling case. However, some assessment must be given to the\nother pertinent factors by which the trial court's exercise of discretion must be guided. Particularly pertinent to the\ncourt's consideration here are the unique circumstances in which the District found itself not long before the\nreceivership order was entered. The Congress had established the Authority and delegated to it the power to act\nso as to secure sound financial and management responsibility for the District government. In that connection,\nthe Authority had taken steps to address various problems with local government, including its educational\nsystem. To that end, the Authority appointed an Emergency Transitional Education Board of Trustees to institute\nreforms in the public schools. It was only in April 1998 that the Authority appointed Arlene Ackerman as Chief\n1214 Executive Officer/Superintendent of *1214 the D.C. Public School System. The Authority sought an opportunity\nfor the new superintendent to institute a quality educational program at Oak Hill and filed a declaration in support\nof the District's application to stay the order imposing a receivership. Pursuant to its statutory powers, the\nAuthority issued a Directive on July 13, 1998, which was intended to facilitate the establishment of a program of\nquality education consistent with the requirements of Jerry M. at Oak Hill, with the assistance of the new\nsuperintendent. In appointing a receiver, the trial court failed to consider adequately the availability of this\ncongressionally appointed body and its appointee, the superintendent, as bearing upon the factors of leadership\navailability and bad faith. See Dixon, supra, 967 F.Supp. at 550 (citation omitted). Whether a newly appointed\nreceiver could secure compliance more speedily than the duly appointed Authority and its appointee is among the\nfactors which must be weighed. See id.\nThe decision of whether to appoint a receiver is within the court's discretion. See Dixon, supra, 967 F.Supp. at\n550 (citing Fleet Nat. Bank v. H. & D. Entertainment, Inc., 926 F.Supp. 226, 233 (D.Mass.1996)). In determining\nwhether that discretion has been properly exercised, we consider, among other things, whether the trial court\nfailed to consider a relevant factor. See Johnson v. United States, 398 A.2d 354, 365 (D.C.1979). We conclude\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in appointing a receiver because several important criteria were omitted\n\nfrom the trial court's consideration in this case as above-described. See Dixon, 967 F.Supp. at 550. In\nconsidering the necessity for this remedy of last resort, it was essential for the trial court to consider, in addition to\nthe past performance of the District under prior circumstances, the availability of new leadership, the brief time\nthat the new superintendent had to act, the capability of new leadership to \"turn the tide,\" the presence of good\nfaith or bad faith at the time, and the prospects for the receiver of providing a speedy remedy. A proper\nconsideration of all of the relevant factors, given the extraordinary nature of the remedy, can lead only to the\nconclusion that an insufficient basis was shown for the appointment of a receiver under the circumstances\nexisting at the time of the entry of the order.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order appealed from hereby is reversed and remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\nSo ordered.\n[1] The District officials named as defendants in the case included the Mayor, the Director of the Department of\nHuman Services (DHS), the Commissioner of Social Services, the Administrator of the Youth Services\nAdministration (YSA), the Superintendent of Oak Hill, Cedar Knoll and the Receiving Home, and the\nSuperintendent of Special Education of the D.C. Public Schools. District of Columbia v. Jerry M., 571 A.2d 178,\n180 n. 5 (D.C.1990).\n[2] The Consent Decree was based on the following general principles: \n(1) \"the right of children to be housed and provided services in the least restrictive setting consistent with the\nprotection of the public, the youth's individual needs and with applicable court rules, statutory and constitutional\nprovisions\"; (2) \"the right of a child not to be in secure confinement when capable of functioning effectively in a\ncommunity based program\"; and, (3) \"a child should remain in pretrial detention for the shortest possible period\nand in no event to exceed 30 days or, in the case of a pretrial shelter house placement, 45 days....\"\nJerry M., 571 A.2d at 181.\n[3] The Consent Decree defined the class to be \"all children who are or come to be confined in the three juvenile\nfacilities, Oak Hill, Oak Hill Annex (also known as Cedar Knoll), and the Receiving Home for Children, operated\nby the District of Columbia, for so long as they are in YSA custody.\" Jerry M., supra note 1, 571 A.2d at 181 n. 6.\n[4] The trial court indicated that it would consider \"more drastic and far-reaching remedies\" if [appellants]\ncontinued to fail to meet their obligations under the Consent Decree. The trial court then stated in a footnote that\n\"[a]s more and more government functions are placed in court-ordered receiverships, this Court may have to\nconsider this option as well.\"\n[5] \"In this Commitment, DCPS acknowledged its responsibility for the evaluation or re-evaluation of students\nsuspected of having or having identified disabilities under the IDEA. DCPS also committed to providing\npsychological services to such students as required by their IEPs.\"\n[6] Appellees objected \"noting the historical lack of involvement and interest by DCPS in Oak Hill, the shortfall in\nthe proposed budget, an inadequate number of teachers and aids, and an overall lack of coordination and\nplanning between DCPS and YSA.\"\n[7] The Authority is an entity which Congress created to address the District's fiscal crisis and to secure sound\nfinancial stability and management for the government. D.C.Code §§ 47-391.1 to -393 (1997).\n[8] To ensure compliance with this mandate, the Directive authorized the Director to use emergency procurement\nrules.\n[9] The Assistant to the Special Master \"noted that the teachers were to be hired by August 19 and that [the\nDirector] had informed teachers that he expected the employment situation to be finalized by August 1, which\ndate was later changed to August 7.\" The Assistant to the Special Master indicated in the Memorandum that the\n\nDirector orally indicated that \"it was unresolved budget/contract issues between DHS and DCPS that were\ndelaying the hiring.\"\n[10] The trial court found that 31% of the teachers at Oak Hill lacked current certification in the areas in which\nthey were teaching.\n[11] The parties do not suggest that the powers of the Receiver have ceased.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Schwab, Asst. Corp. Counsel, with whom Herbert O. Reid, Acting Corp. Counsel, Charles L.\nReischel, Deputy Corp. Counsel, and Lutz Alexander Prager, Asst. Deputy Corp. Counsel, were on the brief, for\nappellant.\nDavid A. Reiser, Public Defender Service, with whom Kim A. Taylor, Public Defender Service, James Klein, Public\nDefender Service, and Donna Wulkan were on the brief, for appellees.\nBefore ROGERS, Chief Judge, and SCHWELB and FARRELL, Associate Judges.\nROGERS, Chief Judge:\nThe reformers who championed the establishment of juvenile courts in the United States envisioned a system in\nwhich youthful law violators would receive treatment and other forms of rehabilitation and thereby become\nproductive members of society without forever being tarnished by criminal records as a result of youthful\nindiscretions. See In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 15, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1437, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1966). While the visions of\nthe reformers did not always comport with the reality of juvenile court systems, hope persists that the system will\nwork. Even today this hope appears not to be totally unrealistic in view of the experts' conclusion that \"[c]onfined\n[1]\njuveniles in the District of Columbia are, for the most part, neither violent nor chronic offenders.\"  Clearly, there\nis no lack of recognition of the need to expand the services that are available to such juveniles. On July 24, 1986,\nthe parties agreed and the trial judge approved a Consent Decree that called for \"an assessment and study of the\njuvenile population in existing YSA juvenile facilities ... to determine an appropriate configuration and design for\n[2]\nthe confinement of children in the custody of YSA.\"  In the view of the trial judge the Decree represented a\n\"monumental effort\" to bring about correction of conditions for such youth.\nIn this appeal the District of Columbia contends that the trial judge exceeded his authority under the Consent\nDecree in ordering the District to take actions to which it had not consented. Specifically, the District maintains\nthat the judge erred in ordering (1) five secure decentralized facilities that would replace existing secure\ninstitutions, (2) a cap of 60 on the number of juveniles in residential placements outside the District, where there\nis no representative plaintiff and the question had not been at issue in the case, (3) a case management system\nthat is the functional equivalent of a system previously agreed upon by the parties, and (4) broad-ranging\nmanagement reforms in YSA. It further contends that the judge abused his discretion by ordering caps on the\nnumber of securely detained juveniles recommended by the Panel, but rejecting the Panel's recommendation for\njudicial reforms necessary to achieve the caps. Finally, the District contends that the judge erred in enforcing the\none-juvenile-per-room provision of the Consent Decree by entering a new mandatory injunction to which the\nDistrict never agreed, requiring that the District transfer juveniles to shelter or group homes within ten days of the\ndetermination that they are suitable for less secure confinement. Appellees respond that in view of the District's\n180 pervasive noncompliance with the *180 Decree for three and one half years, this court should, with one exception\nregarding decentralization of secure facilities, affirm because the trial judge did not impose any new duties on the\nDistrict, but simply fleshed out the provisions of the decree in a more specific remedial order.\nFinding ourselves in total agreement with the parties and the trial judge that improvements in the alternatives to\nsecure detention are imperative for juveniles who do not require secure detention, we nevertheless conclude that\n\nportions of the judge's orders exceeded his authority under the Consent Decree. We do so with some reluctance\nsince the District's record of compliance with the Decree leaves much to be desired and the judge exercised\nconsiderable restraint, on several occasions agreeing to the District's requests precisely because he\nacknowledged some of the bureaucratic and administrative problems that YSA was experiencing. Still, the\nDecree of July 24, 1986, was limited in scope and, in turn, limited what the judge was authorized to do in ordering\ncompliance with it.\nThe Consent Decree agreed to by the parties, and approved by the trial judge, was limited to the design of\nplacement alternatives for youth no longer requiring secure confinement, and expressly recognized that the\nrequirement for secure placement of juveniles was subject to judicial authority beyond the control of the parties.\nHence the orders of the trial judge regarding decentralization of the secure facilities, placements outside the\nDistrict of Columbia, and the management of the YSA were beyond the scope of the four corners of the Decree\nand beyond the judge's authority. Otherwise we affirm. The trial judge recognized that the demographics of\nsecurely committed juveniles had changed since the Panel's report in adopting the Panel's cap\nrecommendations. The decree as well as the judge's orders afforded the District the opportunity to adapt to\nchanged circumstances and to submit new figures. See Order of April 8, 1988 and Memorandum Order \"D,\"\nnotes 14 & 16, infra. What the court did not do was ignore the District's agreement to implement a juvenile justice\nsystem with a variety of community based services and thereby reduce the time youth were inappropriately\nhoused in secure facilities. Further, in view of the provisions of the Consent Decree designed to minimize the time\nthat a juvenile remained in a secure facility if found suitable for less restrictive confinement, and the provisions of\nMemorandum Orders \"C\" and \"D,\" note 16, infra, from which the District did not appeal, the judge did not exceed\nhis authority in ordering, over three years after the decree had been entered, that the District remove children\nwithin ten days.\nI\n[3] [4]\nJerry M., representing appellees, the class of detained  and committed  children confined at the District of\nColumbia's secure juvenile institutions, filed suit challenging the failure of the District of Columbia and those\n[5]\nofficials  responsible for administering the juvenile facilities (District) to provide appropriate care, rehabilitation,\nand treatment to them in violation of the Constitution and the District of Columbia Code. After extensive pretrial\ndiscovery and briefing, the parties presented a settlement agreement to the trial judge on July 17, 1986.\nFollowing a hearing on July 24, 1986, during which the parties responded to concerns raised by the trial judge,\n181 and modified *181 their agreement accordingly, the judge approved the settlement agreement and entered the\nConsent Decree as a binding judgment.\nThe Consent Decree was based on three general principles. The first principle was \"the right of children to be\nhoused and provided services in the least restrictive setting consistent with the protection of the public, the\nyouth's individual needs and with applicable court rules, statutory and constitutional provisions.\" The second\nprinciple was the right of a child not to be in secure confinement when capable of functioning effectively in a\ncommunity based program. The third principle was that a child should remain in pretrial detention for the shortest\npossible period and in no event to exceed 30 days or, in the case of a pretrial shelter house placement, 45 days,\nbut recognized that the presence of juveniles in pretrial detention for longer periods as a result of court delays\nwould require the District to provide additional detention slots.\nThe Decree established a panel of three experts (Panel), one named by the appellees, one selected by the\nappellants, and one chosen by the parties, to \"determine the appropriate number of juveniles in need of secure\nconfinement in the District and to develop a system for appropriate care, services, and placement of securely\n[6]\nconfined juveniles in YSA custody.\"  The Decree also appointed a monitor to make findings and\nrecommendations \"concerning steps to be taken to achieve compliance.\" The Panel was to base its\ndetermination of the number of children who could be securely confined on its \"assessment of the current\npopulation within YSA custody,\" and to \"prepare a specific comprehensive plan for the design, development, and\nimplementation of community-based programming and alternatives with specific objectives and time tables in\naccordance with the [three general] principles set forth in [the Decree].\" In addition, the Panel was to establish\n\n\"standards and procedures as well as a mechanism for ongoing review and community placement of all detained\n[7]\nand committed children confined in YSA custody.\"  Provision was made for exceptions in emergencies and the\nhousing of a number of children in secure facilities in excess of the number provided in the Panel's plan as a\n[8]\nresult of a court order. Other provisions concerned conditions at institutions and required housing limitations,\nminimum standards for staffing and training, improvements in diagnostic services, treatment planning through\nindividual service plans (ISP) and Team Leaders, as well as education, recreational, and mental health services\n[9]\nand medical services.  The Decree further provided that appellees would not seek to have the District\n182 defendants held in contempt of court so long as they had *182 taken \"all reasonable steps, employing their\nutmost diligence, to ensure substantial compliance with\" this Decree.\nThe Panel submitted to the trial judge on March 11, 1987, its final plan of 48 recommendations which the Panel\nadvised were \"intrinsically connected to one another.\" The Panel explicitly stated, however, that it did \"not attempt\n[10]\nto address issues of implementation\" and that its report \"should not be considered a detailed work plan.\"  The\nrecommendations revolved around four areas that the panelists considered to be prerequisites for change: YSA\naccountability based on an integrated case management system; expansion of the options in the service delivery\nsystem; emphasis on the neighborhood in an effort to strengthen families and thereby reduce delinquency; and a\ncooperative public-private partnership. Specifically, the plan included increased use of diversion from\nprosecution, temporary housing for youth whose parents cannot be located, increased use of \"home detention,\"\nshort term foster care, alternatives to secure detention, creation of therapeutic group homes for committed\nyouths, creation of programs for juvenile drug users including new treatment facilities and youth-run businesses;\nregular review of placements; increased involvement of community groups in providing services; and improved\nrecord keeping and monitoring of placements. It also explicitly called for the Family Division to assure faster\n[11]\nprocessing of juvenile cases within 180 days.  The plan envisioned a detention program approximately half the\n[12]\nsize of that then in existence.\nThe parties filed written responses to the plan, and on October 9, 1987, the trial judge issued Memorandum\n183 Order \"A,\" approving the Panel's plan with modifications.[13] The District thereafter filed a motion *183 to alter or\namend Memorandum Order \"A\" on the grounds that the trial judge had altered the Panel's plan by eliminating the\ncommitment of the judiciary to prompt hearings, and that the data relied on by the Panel were no longer current in\nlight of the number of juveniles ordered held in secure detention and the sharp rise in the percentage of such\njuveniles with drug charges (from 19% to 40%). The judge denied the motion on April 8, 1988. While\nacknowledging that the demographics, as the District maintained, appeared to have changed in the past year, the\n[14]\njudge placed the obligation on the District to present a proposal matching current realities.  On March 28,\n1988, in response to Memorandum Order \"A,\" the District had submitted what, in the judge's view, was \"an\nimpressive sixty-eight (68) page plan to the Court that provided for an expanded continuum of care,\" that was\n\"broader in some respects than Memorandum Order `A,' [but] on its face... not fully responsive to the Court's\nOrder.\" The trial judge issued written interrogatories to the parties on April 29, 1988, and following a hearing on\nMay 9, 1988, issued Memorandum Order \"B\" on May 20, 1988, which reaffirmed the Panel plan and, \"[w]ith\n[15]\nreluctance,\" adopted the District's requests for extended periods of time in which to comply.  The District noted\nan appeal from Memorandum Order \"A\" on May 9, 1988, and appealed Memorandum Order \"B\" on June 20,\n1988. The District also appeals the trial court's Memorandum Order \"E,\" dated May 24, 1989, ordering sanctions\nand remedial relief based on its March 10, 1989, determination that the District was in contempt of both the\n[16]\nConsent Decree and Memorandum Order \"C,\" dated October 14, 1988.  All appeals were consolidated.\n184  II\n*184\n[17]\nWaiver of Appellate Rights.  We address first appellees' threshold contention that the District's appeals must\nbe dismissed because the plain meaning of the waiver section of the Consent Decree prohibits the District from\n[18]\nappealing.  The District maintains that it did not waive its right of appeal from those aspects of the trial judge's\norders that exceed the Decree's delegation of authority to the Panel and the trial court. Included in these are the\n\ntrial judge's orders altering the Panel's final plan by accepting numbers included in the Panel's recommendations\nwhile rejecting its recommendations for reform of the Superior Court Family Division procedures.\nBy its plain terms, the Decree provides that either party may appeal from those portions of the orders which\nmodify the Panel's final plan. Although the trial judge had no authority to order changes in Superior Court\n[19]\npractice,  the judge's deletions of the Panel's recommendations regarding the procedures of the Superior\n185 Court Family Division constitute a modification *185 of the Panel's final plan, and are therefore appealable under\nthe term of the waiver claim. Obviously, every minor revision of the Plan would not give rise to an appealable\nissue since the waiver of appellate rights was an important part of the parties' agreement, and they are bound to\nit as it is incorporated into the Consent Decree. But the fundamental linkage between the Panel's recommended\ncaps and the changes in Superior Court procedures is clear from the Panel's report. Under these circumstances\nwe are satisfied that the District could not have intended to agree to the caps without simultaneous changes in\ncourt procedures. Nor can the waiver provision be read to waive the right to appeal an order on the ground that it\nexceeds the scope of the Decree. See Fire-fighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 575-76, 104\nS.Ct. 2576, 2586, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984); Baker Industries Inc. v. Cerberus, Ltd., 570 F.Supp. 1237, 1259\n(D.N.J.1983),aff'd,764 F.2d 204 (3d Cir.1985) (master's findings not final, hence may be appealed, to extent \"he\nexceeded the scope of his reference\").\nIII\nSuperior Court Authority under the Consent Decree. A consent decree is a strange hybrid of a contract,\nnegotiated by the parties, and a court order, which can be altered by a court if \"circumstances\" warrant. Brown v.\nNeeb, 644 F.2d 551, 557 (6th Cir.1981). Of particular relevance is the observation of the Supreme Court that\n[c]onsent decrees are entered into by parties to a case after careful negotiation has produced\nagreement on their precise terms. The parties waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the\ncase and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation. Naturally, the\nagreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost and\nelimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded\nwith the litigation. Thus, the decree itself cannot be said to have a purpose; rather the parties have\npurposes, generally opposed to each other, and the resultant decree embodies as much of those\nopposing purposes as the respective parties have the bargaining power and skill to achieve. For\nthese reasons, the scope of a consent decree must be discerned within its four corners, and not\nby reference to what might satisfy the purposes of one of the parties.\nUnited States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681-82, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757-58, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971) (emphasis\nin original) (footnote omitted). See Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, supra, 467 U.S. at 574, 104 S.Ct.\nat 2585. Therefore, a consent decree is construed as a valid contract between the parties and its scope \"must be\ndetermined from within its four corners.\" Baker v. District of Columbia, 494 A.2d 1299, 1302 (D.C.1985) (citing \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission v. Premex, Inc., 655 F.2d 779, 782 (7th Cir. 1981)). See United States v.\nITT Continental Banking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 233-37, 95 S.Ct. 926, 932-35, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975); Armour, supra,\n402 U.S. at 682, 91 S.Ct. at 1757; United States v. Atlantic Refining, 360 U.S. 19, 20-24, 79 S.Ct. 944, 945-47, 3\nL.Ed.2d 1054 (1959). However, the trial judge's interpretation of a Consent Decree is entitled to deference; \"few\npersons are in a better position to understand the meaning of a consent decree than the judge who oversaw and\napproved it.\" Brown v. Neeb, supra, 644 F.2d at 558 n. 12. See United States v. City of Chicago, 717 F.2d 378,\n382 (7th Cir.1983).\nIn contending that the Superior Court exceeded its authority under the Consent Decree, the District argues: (1)\nthe trial court erred in ordering the District to plan for a juvenile justice system with fewer securely detained and\ncommitted juveniles without implementing the Panel's recommended reforms for case processing in the Superior\nCourt's Family Division; (2) the provision of five decentralized secure facilities with bed slots equal to the number\nof secure beds in the entire system is tantamount to closing Oak Hill, which the Decree contemplated would\n186 remain open; (3) the trial court and the Panel were limited *186 by the Consent Decree to planning only for non-\nsecure alternatives to secure confinement; and (4) the trial court and the Panel lacked the authority to restrict the\n\nnumber of residential placements outside the District of Columbia, because the Panel was to restrict itself to\nDistrict institutions and placement. In general, the District maintains that the trial judge construed the Consent\nDecree as broadening the authority delegated to the Panel, including authority not contemplated by the parties or\n[20]\ndiscernible from the four corners of the Consent Decree.  Appellees respond that the judge acted within his\nauthority to assure the District's compliance with the Consent Decree.\nBecause the trial judge's authority to assure compliance by the District government with the Consent Decree\nturns on the scope of the Decree, we have set forth the provisions of the Decree and the judge's orders in some\n[21]\ndetail. While considerable deference is due the trial judge's interpretation of the scope of the Decree,  that\ndeference must be informed by the record of the proceedings before the trial judge. The Consent Decree\ncontemplated that by 1989 the District would have in place community-based facilities in sufficient numbers and\n[22]\nvariety so that juveniles eligible for release from secure facilities could be very quickly placed.  Three years\n[23]\nafter the Decree took effect the District has not accomplished this goal.  Any number of explanations were\npresented to the trial judge, but the question is whether, and in what respects (if any), it was beyond the authority\n[24]\nof the trial judge to impose the sanctions that he did.\nA.\nWe summarize the bases for our conclusions. First, contrary to appellees' assertions on appeal, the Consent\nDecree did not call for the complete reform of the juvenile justice system in the District of Columbia. Quite\nspecifically, the Decree called for the development and design of community-based facilities as alternatives to the\nsecure facilities housing youth for whom such detention was not required. At the July 24, 1987, hearing before\nthe trial judge the parties agreed that the Decree did not address the District's secure facilities, which were to\ncontinue in operation, nor did it reach into the administration of the programs to be carried on in the community-\nbased facilities or address the issue of those children who went directly to group homes or other non-secure\n187 facilities. Rather, *187 the Decree focused on the use of jointly-selected experts to design the services and\nfacilities needed as alternatives for youth unnecessarily being held in secure detention, and the use of a monitor\nto advise the court on the District's progress or lack thereof in implementing the plan. Indeed, the trial judge\nexplicitly recognized the limits of the Decree when he commented that it was his hope that the larger effort\nneeded to accomplish the broader goals identified by the Panel would occur.\nSecond, nothing in the Consent Decree suggests that it was frozen in time insofar as the youth population to be\nserved was concerned. At the July 24, 1987, hearing the parties and the trial judge agreed that the Decree could\nnot limit the authority of the Family Division judges to commit juveniles to secure facilities. The Decree\nacknowledged the judicial authority to order secure detention that would require the District to maintain additional\nsecure placements. In addition, it provided for semi-annual meetings between executive and judicial branch\nrepresentatives to address whether the juvenile justice system was functioning consistently with the Decree. The\nPanel Report expressly contemplated that its recommendations could not be implemented without further review\nby the parties and the court so that a detailed and realistic work plan for implementation could be developed. The\nreport contemplated further that time would be required since not only were additional staff and programs\nnecessary, but budget requests would have to be approved and court procedures adjusted in some respects.\nThird, the District clearly understood that it had committed itself under the Consent Decree to developing a\nvariety of alternative services and community based facilities. As this court has recently reemphasized, parties\nmust obey court orders. See D.D. v. M.T., 550 A.2d 37 (D.C.1988). In view of the District's failure to take what the\njudge correctly characterized as minimal steps to ensure collaboration among the various elements of the\nexecutive branch, the passage of time, and the fact that rigid conformance with the Decree has never been\nordered, the trial judge properly rejected some of the District's objections to the court's omission of the Panel's\ndirections for judicial reforms. The judge acknowledged that the District's information about the number and types\nof commitments appeared to show a change in the relevant demographics, and issued an order that provided the\nDistrict with the opportunity to come back to the court with a new configuration, \"fully anticipat[ing] [that the\nnumbers] ... might not be feasible....\" See Order of April 8, 1988, note 14, supra. The judge subsequently directed\nthe Monitor to evaluate whether the needs of the institutional population had changed since the Panel had made\n\nits recommendations. See Memorandum Order \"E,\" note 16, supra. Under these circumstances, the judge could\nproperly reject the District's bureaucratic explanations of its delay and direct it to respond with a specific plan to\naddress changes needed in the comprehensive juvenile justice plan. The record makes clear that the judge was\ndirecting the District only to live up to its commitment to implement a program that would more quickly move\nyouth out of secure facilities and into the facilities they needed. Hence, the record supports the judge's\nconclusion that \"[t]he suggestion... that such a change in population has somehow obstructed [the District] from\nliving up to the three year old commitment is bogus. No such external forces have prevented the establishment of\nthe continuum of programs necessary to better and more comprehensively service the troubled youth of this\ncommunity.\"\nFourth, the parties made it clear at the July 24, 1986, hearing that, in agreeing to the Consent Decree, the YSA\nwas not surrendering its responsibilities for administration of the juvenile facilities and the programs in the\nfacilities. The Decree placed a number of responsibilities on the YSA, and the Panel's plan added others. The\nadministrative means by which it fulfilled those responsibilities remained, however, for YSA to determine. The\nresponsibility to select these means was not transferred to the court or, as ordered by the court, to the Panel. It is\n188 readily understandable *188 that, as the District continued to miss deadlines, the judge experienced great\nfrustration in achieving the District's compliance with the Consent Decree. The options available to the judge,\nhowever, did not include redesigning and reordering the administration of YSA.\nFifth, the District has not helped its cause in this case since its delays were so often due to matters within its\ncontrol. Indeed, the trial judge showed considerable understanding of the District's problems when he took into\naccount the turmoil in YSA as a result of reorganizations and the new administrator's explanation that without\ninternal management reforms compliance with the Consent Decree was not possible. As the trial judge observed,\n\"[i]t appears in retrospect that defendants entered into the Decree without a full appreciation of the liabilities\nfacing any administration of YSA attempting to implement the changes required by the Decree.\" Still, the new\nmanagement at YSA was a hopeful sign, in the judge's view, that \"YSA appears to be over the worst of its internal\nreorganizations turmoil, and YSA managers can turn their attention to moving forward in implementing this Order\nand generally complying with the Decree.\" Further, the record fully supports the trial judge's finding in\nMemorandum Order \"E,\" note 16, supra, that the District had ample time and opportunity over a three year period\nto develop new detention and commitment alternatives. While we conclude that the trial judge exceeded his\nauthority with respect to some of the remedial steps he ordered, he did not err in finding that the District had\nfailed to meet its basic commitment under the Decree to develop a broad range of alternative community based\nservices and facilities.\nB.\nWith this background we turn to the District's specific contentions on appeal.\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to bind the Superior Court to the parties' consent decree.\nThe parties addressed this issue with the trial judge prior to signing the decree. The proposed Consent Decree\nwas amended at the direction of the trial judge specifically to remove any language which appeared to bind\nSuperior Court judges. The District cannot now successfully raise the same issue years later. Further, as noted\nabove, the District was not without recourse. Not only did the Decree recognize that the District had to respond to\njudicial commitment orders, but the District committed itself to holding\nsemi-annual meetings convened by the Mayor or his designee of the pertinent officials in the\njuvenile justice process, including the monitor of this Decree and the Corporation Counsel or his\ndesignee, the Director of the Public Defender Service or her designee and representatives from\nthe Family Trial Lawyers Association, to discuss whether the juvenile justice system is operating\nconsistent with the principles set forth in section I(A)(1).\nThe trial judge noted the District had not held such a meeting during the twenty (20) months following the signing\nof the Consent Decree and found the District \"disingenuous\" in its attempt to avoid its responsibilities under the\ndecree by citing the court's unwillingness to bind itself.\n\nAs to the cap on the number of secure beds, the Decree expressly directed the Panel to \"determine the number\nof children that the District of Columbia may confine in secure facilities in accordance with the principles set forth\nin Section A.\" The Panel did so, recommending that the District confine no more than 42 detained and 60\ncommitted youths. Report at 168-71. The Decree expressly directs the Panel to set a maximum number, subject\nto the court's approval. The plain language of the Decree makes it clear that this recommendation of the Panel\nwas within the boundaries of its directive. For reasons previously noted, since the Decree included the leeway for\njudicial commitments, the judge's deletion of those portions of the Panel's recommendations relating to faster\ncourt proceedings of cases did not place the District in an impossible position; indeed, it has never so argued. In\n189 any event, neither *189 appellees nor the trial judge enforced the provisions of the Decree that called for the\nDistrict to close Cedar Knoll, thus leaving 138 additional single room secure beds and 68 dormitory beds above\nthe cap.\nWe agree with the District, however, that the Panel and the trial judge were limited by the Consent Decree to plan\n[25]\nonly for non-secure alternatives to secure confinement.  The Panel concluded that small, decentralized and\nspecialized treatment programs are more effective than more restrictive large institutions. The Decree is itself\nreplete with references to community based alternatives to existing institutions, but makes no reference to\ndecentralization of secure facilities. The parties were clear that the Panel was limited to recommending the\nnumber of secure beds and was not to make recommendations about the programs to be used in secure\nfacilities. Inclusion in the Decree of the pages on improvements at Oak Hill and the Receiving Home in staffing,\nprograms, resident rights and discipline, and services, is written evidence of the parties' understanding that these\n[26]\ninstitutions would continue in existence.  The judge's acknowledgment that the Panel's proposals went beyond\nthe Decree in some respects, when he expressed his hope that the district would implement even those panel\nrecommendations, seems apt here.\nAdditionally, we find no basis for the Panel to address the number of residential placements outside the\nboundaries of the District of Columbia. The Decree refers to community based facilities and to juveniles within the\nplaintiff class who are in District of Columbia facilities. This is different from out-of-city placements in non-D.C.\nfacilities and from youths in residential placements, neither of which were contemplated by the parties as falling\nwithin the scope of the Decree. If available, the Panel advised, \"local therapeutic group care, specialized foster\ncare, and nonresidential psychoeducational, drug, and intensive job training programs could more effectively\nmeet the needs of some youth than residential treatment centers.\" By substituting a local network in place of out-\nof-state residential placements, the Panel expected to reduce delays, improve the quality of services, and save\nmoney. Even though the rationale underlying the Panel's recommendation makes sense, the Consent Decree\naddressed only the needs of youth improperly retained in the District's secure facilities because of a lack of\nappropriate community-based alternatives and was not a cure-all for the District's institutional programs. The\nPanel's broad mandate to construct \"a specific comprehensive plan for the design, development, and\nimplementation of community-based programming\" is limited by the context in which the Decree was entered. A\nfair reading of the record, as appellees appeared to concede at oral argument, shows that out-of-state facilities\nwere not contemplated within the compromise Consent Decree arising out of appellee's lawsuit on behalf of\nyouths in secure facilities.\nFinally, we agree with the District that in limited respects Memorandum Order \"A\" impermissibly impinges on\nYSA's management prerogatives. While the Consent Decree challenged the Panel to \"establish standards and\n190 procedures as well as a *190 mechanism for the on-going review of all detained and committed children confined\nin YSA custody,\" the July 24, 1986, hearing made it clear that the parties contemplated that YSA would retain\nadministrative responsibility for implementing the Panel's plan, including quality assurance review. Indeed, the\nPanel emphasized the importance to the success of its plan of having YSA assume responsibility, and the trial\njudge's own recognition that YSA's internal reorganization turmoil was finally at an end was further\nacknowledgment that day to day management and administration remained with the agency, not the court, the\nPanel or the Monitor. Although, as the judge correctly found, YSA had surrendered some of its management\nprerogatives in the Decree, specifically with regard to the habilitation assessment of children, it did not surrender\nthem all, and those it surrendered were of a decidedly different nature from the budget, data processing,\npersonnel and contracting functions at issue in Memorandum Order \"B.\" Further, the parties also recognized that\n\nexisting budgetary and personnel systems for the executive branch would remain applicable when the Decree\nbecame effective.\nAppellees maintain that the case management system developed by the Panel did not duplicate the treatment\nteam concept in the Decree since the latter addressed institutionalized juveniles while the former case\nmanagement system developed by the Panel focused on continuous monitoring of youth in community\nplacements as well as institutions. Even so, nothing suggests that YSA intended the Panel or the trial court to\nplan such managerial reform of YSA as would cause it to surrender control over the caseloads of case managers.\nThe Panel's recommended maximum caseload of 20 for each case manager of non-institutionalized youth is\nquite different from the limitations agreed to by the parties as part of the Consent Decree, which called for an\n[27]\nassessment mechanism and limited the ratio of staff to residents in several instances.  While the Monitor's\nsemi-annual reports made it clear, and YSA officials themselves conceded, that it would be impossible for YSA to\ncomply with the Consent Decree without improving its management, management changes were made, and the\njudge acknowledged, in finding the District to be in contempt, that the District had taken steps toward future\ncompliance, albeit too little too late.\nIV\nContempt. Civil contempt is a sanction designed to enforce compliance with an order of the court. D.D. v. M.T.,\nsupra, 550 A.2d at 43 (citing McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. 187, 191, 69 S.Ct. 497, 499, 93 L.Ed.\n599 (1949); Zapata v. Zapata, 499 A.2d 905, 908 (D.C. 1985)). As noted above, a consent order is\n\"indistinguishable in its legal effect from any other court order, and therefore subject to enforcement like any other\ncourt order.\" Moore v. Jones, 542 A.2d 1253, 1254 (D.C.1988) (quoting Padgett v. Padgett, 472 A.2d 849, 852\n(D.C.1984)). Consequently, a consent decree is a court order which may be enforced by contempt. D.D. v. M.T.,\n[28]\nsupra, 550 A.2d at 44.  Where the purpose of contempt is to compel a party to comply, the court \"must\nconsider the character and magnitude of the harm threatened by the continued violation, and the probable\neffectiveness of any suggested sanction in bringing about the desired result.\" United States v. United Mine\nWorkers, 330 U.S. 258, 304, 67 S.Ct. 677, 701, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947) (footnote omitted).\n191 *191 \"The decision whether to hold a party in civil contempt is confided to the sound discretion of the trial judge,\nand will be reversed on appeal only upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\" D.D. v. M.T., supra, 550 A.2d at\n44. Similarly, the trial judge enjoys broad discretionary powers in designing appropriate orders for contemptuous\nconduct. Hubbard v. Fleet Mortgage Co., 810 F.2d 778, 782 (8th Cir.1987) (\"In contempt cases, the trial court has\ndiscretion to fashion the punishment to fit the circumstances.\" (citing United Mine Workers, supra, 330 U.S. at\n303, 67 S.Ct. at 701). See also In re Arthur Teacher's Franchisee Litigation, 689 F.2d 1150, 1158-59 (3d\nCir.1982) (\"[d]istrict courts have broad powers to fashion remedial relief in civil contempt proceedings ... [and]...\nmay require the contemnor to perform various affirmative acts, even though these actions were not mandated by\nthe underlying decree.\"); Perfect Fit Industries Inc. v. Acme Quilting Co., 673 F.2d 53, 57 (2d Cir.1982) (district\ncourt has broad discretion to design a remedy that will bring about compliance where purpose of civil contempt is\ncoercive). A contemnor may be subject to a staggering daily fine. United States v. City of Yonkers, N.Y., 856 F.2d\n444 (2d Cir.1988),aff'd in part, rev'd in part,___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 625, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990) (city\nconditionally fined up to $1,000,000.00 per day). See United Mine Workers, supra, 330 U.S. at 303, 67 S.Ct. at\n701. Finally, there is precedent for imposing monetary sanctions for violations of population provisions in\ncorrectional settings as a sanction for contempt of court orders. 12 John Does v. District of Columbia, 272\nU.S.App.D.C. 235, 855 F.2d 874, 878 (1988); Mobile County Jail Inmates v. Purvis, 551 F.Supp. 92\n(S.D.Ala.1982).\nThe District maintains that the trial judge exceeded his equitable powers when he chose to enforce the provisions\nof the Decree prohibiting more than one child per room at the District's three secure institutions. Specifically, the\nDistrict argues that the trial judge's finding of contempt and his remedial order, Memorandum Order \"E,\" setting a\nten day transfer period ceiling subject to fine for violation, lack \"essential findings necessary to support any\ninjunction relating to the adequacy of legal remedies and irreparable harm.\" The District points out that its own\nOctober 4, 1988, plan designed to remedy the population and staffing problems faced by YSA was improperly\nsupplemented in the trial judge's order of October 14, 1988, by the demands of appellees. See Memorandum\n\nOrder \"C,\" note 16, supra (setting a 45 day period for transfers and new facilities openings and requiring the\nDistrict to comply with the single room requirement by December 31, 1988). The District argues that the Decree\ndid not authorize extraordinary relief of 10-day transfers subject to fine and that the trial judge's rationale is faulty\nsince the injunction is \"wholly independent of the `one child per room' requirements of the consent decree.\"\nThe District's contention that the trial judge's sanctions impose an obligation on the District without its consent\nmisses the mark. The District has already consented to be bound by the Consent Decree as an order of the\nSuperior Court. Further, much of what the judge ordered was based on the District's own plan, submitted October\n4, 1988, and on Memorandum Orders \"C\" and \"D,\" see note 16, supra, from which the District did not appeal.\nThe trial court does not require a party's permission before it may impose sanctions on that party in order to\n[29]\ninduce compliance with the trial court order.\nIn support of its contention the District cites cases where a party has applied to the court for an injunction. \n192 Firefighters*192Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, supra, 467 U.S. at 575, 104 S.Ct. at 2586 (relief not authorized\nby language of the decree); Hughes v. United States, 342 U.S. 353, 357, 72 S.Ct. 306, 308, 96 L.Ed. 394 (1952)\n(grant of injunction reversed because language of decree did not support requirement of injunction); Atlantic\nRefining, supra, 360 U.S. at 23, 79 S.Ct. at 946 (injunction denied because circumstances did not warrant court\nsubstantially changing the terms of the consent decree). In addition, the District relies on a case which addresses\nthe limits governing a trial court's interpretation of a consent decree. Armour, supra, 402 U.S. at 682, 91 S.Ct. at\n1757 (consent decree does not have underlying purposes which can be effected through later remedial orders of\na trial court).\nThe District, however, can hardly maintain persuasively at this point that it did not agree to reduce to the\nmaximum extent possible the waiting period for the transfer of youth in secure institutions to community-based\nprograms more appropriate for their needs. It has not claimed that it has fulfilled its commitments under the\nConsent Decree. The record amply demonstrates that the trial judge accorded the District opportunities and time\n[30]\nto reach the goals that were in the Decree.  It further amply supports the judge's finding of the relationship\nbetween overcrowding and delays in transferring youth to community based facilities and disposes of the\nDistrict's contention that the judge did not purport to find irreparable harm or the inadequacy of legal remedies.\n[31]\n Accordingly, we cannot agree with the District that the one room per child provision is unrelated to the\nrequirement that no child wait more than ten days for placement elsewhere.\nThe District has been found to be in civil contempt. There are only two recognized defenses in civil contempt\nproceedings, substantial compliance and inability to do that which the court commanded. D.D. v. M.T., supra, 550\nA.2d at 44 (citing Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 76, 68 S.Ct. 401, 411, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948); Smith v. Smith, 427\nA.2d 928, 932 (D.C.1980)). The District has not offered either defense.\nAccordingly, except with regard to the provisions for out of state placements, decentralization of secure facilities,\nand management controls of YSA, we affirm Memorandum Orders \"A\" and \"B,\" and we decline to vacate\nMemorandum Order \"E's\" provision requiring transfers within a ten day period.\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part.\n[1] Beyer, Brown and DeMuro, Report of the Jerry M. Panel, submitted to the D.C. Superior Court, March 11,\n1987, at 73 (Report).\n[2] YSA is the Youth Services Administration of the Commission on Social Services in the D.C. Department of\nHuman Services. It is responsible for the confinement of children who are committed by the court to the custody\nof the District of Columbia government.\n[3] These class members are confined awaiting a \"factfinding hearing\" (trial of guilt or innocence) or \"disposition\"\n(determination of the need for rehabilitation and the type of treatment required) pursuant to D.C.Code § 16-2313\n(b) (1989 Repl.).\n[4] These class members are placed in the custody of the Department of Human Services (DHS) for up to two\nyears pursuant to D.C.Code § 16-2320 (1989 Repl.).\n\n[5] The public officials included the Mayor of the District of Columbia; the Director of the Department of Human\nServices (DHS), the Commissioner of Social Services; the Administrator of the Youth Services Administration; the\nSuperintendent of Oak Hill; Cedar Knoll and the Receiving Home; and the Superintendent of Special Education of\nD.C. Public Schools.\n[6] By its terms the decree defined the plaintiff class as \"all children who are or come to be confined in the three\njuvenile facilities, Oak Hill, Oak Hill Annex (also known as Cedar Knoll), and the Receiving Home for Children,\noperated by the District of Columbia, for so long as they are in YSA custody.\" \"Facilities\" and \"institutions\" were\ndefined in the Decree to refer to the same three institutions \"and their successors and any non-community based\nsecure placements.\"\n[7] The Consent Decree required YSA to conduct monthly reviews of the status of all detained or committed\nchildren in its custody and to make \"all reasonable and appropriate adjustments\" to assure less secure\nconfinement for a child. YSA also was to provide a daily count of the children in its custody, and to give notice\nwhen the number of securely held children would exceed 95 percent of the capacity called for in the Panel's plan\nand take appropriate steps to avoid exceeding the limit.\n[8] The Decree required the institutions to house children in single rooms, forbade construction of additional\nsecure institutions unless recommended by the Panel, and mandated the closing of the Cedar Knoll institution by\nDecember 1, 1987, and that no more youth would be placed in it after June 1, 1987.\n[9] Article IV of the Decree provided a process to bring the institutions into compliance with the federal Education\nfor All Handicapped Children Act and the American Public Health Association's Standards for Correctional\nInstitutions (1986 ed.) section on Environmental Health and the American Correction Association's standards for\nvocational training. There also were provisions on disciplinary actions against juveniles, improvements in\nenvironmental conditions and medical services, children's rights, and publication of a student handbook. Articles\nV-X.\n[10] The Panel gave two reasons for the limitation: first, the litigants and the court would review the report before\na final plan was adopted, and second, many of the recommendations were \"intrinsically related to one another\n(e.g. the need for secure detention beds is directly related to how completely and in what time frame the\nrecommendations concerning speedy trial are accepted and implemented).\"\n[11] The Panel report noted that \"unusually long delays in juvenile cases and high juvenile detention rates result\nin the District of Columbia government being required to provide a disproportionately larger number of juvenile\ndetention beds than other cities and states with greater juvenile populations.\" Report at 8. It cited as causes of\nthe delays an insufficient number of judges available to preside over trials and dispositions in the Family Division,\nslow drug analysis by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, inadequate commitment alternatives, a time-\nconsuming residential placement process, and too few defense attorneys and prosecutors. Id. In addition to\nsuggesting an individual calendar system for the Family Division, the report stated that most trials for juveniles in\nsecure detention should occur within 20 days of the detention hearing and within 30 days for those in shelter\nhouses. The report also called for a two-track scheduling system with most secure cases reaching disposition\nwithin 30 days of arrest and a small number of the more difficult cases requiring 45 days, secure detention cases\ntaking priority. Id. at 8-9. A number of other court-related recommendations addressed other ways to reduce\ndelays in handling juvenile cases. \"The recommendations regarding delay in court processing can be achieved in\n180 days.\" Id. at 19. Thus, the Panel concluded, within another 180 days, there should be a need for only 42\nsecure detention beds. Id.\n[12] The plan analysis was as follows: \n   Current options:          Proposed options*:\nhome detention       190   home detention     150\nfoster homes          10   foster homes        15\n9 shelter houses      80   6 shelter houses    54\nReceiving Home        37   2 staff secure\n\nCedar Knoll          106     shelter houses    16\nOak Hill              62   secure detention    42\nTOTAL                485   TOTAL              277\n                       * if all recommendations\n                         are followed\nReport at 19.\n[13] MEMORANDUM ORDER \"A\" omitted the Panel's recommendations for faster processing of juvenile cases in\nthe Family Division. See note 11, supra. It directed the District to bring the length of detention closer to national\nstandards by (1) putting in place within 60 days a process for reviewing the need of securely detained juveniles\nand publishing written standards and procedures; (2) establishing more consistent supervision over children in\nthe home detention program and coordinating that program with the Public Schools, providing improved services\nto children and their families; (3) within 90 days, providing temporary housing and transportation for children\nwhose parents cannot be located; (4) reducing the number of juveniles in secure detention who can be placed in\nhome detention; (5) within 6 months, expanding short-term foster care facilities to 15 beds as a detention\nalternative for securely held juveniles and operating staff secure shelter houses with 16 beds for fugitives,\nrunaways and absconders. The court also ordered staff training and additional resources and a streamlining of\nthe residential placement process. \nThe District was given 120 days to expand its contracts in order to reduce delays in residential placements, and\ndirected to take specific actions regarding the Interagency Youth Project, vocational program, youth run\nbusinesses, YSA's foster home capacity, and secure group therapeutic homes for committed drug abusers.\nThe District was directed to put into operation within a year five 12-bed decentralized secure programs for violent\nand chronic offenders and reduce the number of committed delinquents in residential treatment outside the city to\nno more than 60.\nMemorandum Order \"A\" also required a system for individualized assessment needs, decentralization of case\nmanagers carrying maximum caseloads of 20 with the capacity to purchase services, and treatment plan reviews\nevery three months. It directed the use of standardized information sheets on each youth and a variety of\npersonnel actions for staff consistent with a reorganization of YSA staff desired by the District.\nThe District was directed to meet with members of the Panel to develop a detailed implementation plan within 45\ndays. The plan was to include no more than 42 secure beds, 60 residential treatment placements outside the city,\nand 60 securely confined committed delinquents.\n[14]ORDER, dated April 8, 1988, denied the District's motion to alter or amend Memorandum Order \"A.\" The\njudge noted that in the 20 months since the Decree had become effective, he knew of no semi-annual meetings\nconducted by the District to review operation of the juvenile justice system in accordance with the general\nprinciples of the Consent Decree. He further acknowledged that the demographics might have changed but that\nthe District, having been ordered to plan and not to implement, had the burden of \"com[ing] forward with a\nreasoned analysis of a configuration that matches current realities,\" and that the District had ceded some of its\nmanagement prerogatives in the decree.\n[15] In MEMORANDUM ORDER \"B,\" the court explained that it had extended the District's time to comply for two\nreasons: first, because the District planned to implement the plan incrementally, and second, in recognition of\nmanagement changes at the top of DHS and the Commission of Social Services.\n[16] Thereafter, following the filing on May 6, 1988, by appellees of a motion for emergency relief to reduce\novercrowding at the Children's Center, the trial judge issued Memorandum Order \"C\" on October 14, 1988, after\nthe parties were unable to mediate their differences. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \"C,\" dated October 14, 1988, directed the District to carry out its short term\nimplementation plan, submitted to the court on October 4, 1988, to remedy overcrowding and understaffing in\nYSA and reduce the population in YSA to 60 by January 31, 1989. The District was to hire staff, conduct a\nclassification review and out-place eligible juveniles by December 15, 1988, increase clients in the Interagency\n\nYouth Project to 30 by December 15, 1988, and review home detention placements. Also, the District was to\nopen two facilities and within 45 days move all youth awaiting group home placement. The District was to reduce\nits institutional population to single room capacity by the end of the year. On November 28, 1988, the trial judge\nissued Memorandum Order \"D\" denying the District's motion to alter or amend Order \"C.\"\nMEMORANDUM ORDER \"D,\" dated November 28, 1988, rejected the District's explanations for its shortfall and\nhiring freeze and an increase in the number of judicial juvenile commitments. The judge observed that since the\nentry of the Decree two years earlier, the District had \"failed to comply with practically every provision of the\nDecree,\" including failure to comply with the Cedar Knoll closure commitment. The judge noted that the District's\nmotion \"raises indirectly the issue of amending the Consent Decree\" in its statement that \"it is uncontroverted that\nCedar Knoll will remain open for the foreseeable future.\" To assist in determining whether to issue remedial\norders compelling the District to comply with its own agreement, the judge directed the Monitor \"to ascertain ...\nwhether the limits of institutional population recommended by the panel remain consistent with the Decree and\nthe needs of youth detained and committed.\"\nOn March 10, 1989, the judge held the District in civil contempt of court. The CONTEMPT ORDER found the\nDistrict in contempt with respect to the population provisions and single room provisions of the Consent Decree. It\nalso found that the District had failed to establish the classification review and to increase the number of clients in\nthe Interagency Youth Program to 30 and to open two ten-bed group home or shelter facilities as set forth in\nMemorandum Order \"C.\" The order directed the District to reduce the waiting list for juveniles awaiting group\nhome placements to ten days. Following hearings that focused on the harm caused to the juveniles who were to\nbenefit from the Decree by the District's noncompliance, the court issued MEMORANDUM ORDER \"E,\" dated\nMay 24, 1989, directing that by September 1, 1989, the District comply with the single room requirements for the\nReceiving Home and Oak Hill, and between June 1 and that date house no more than 42 and 165 persons,\nrespectively, at those institutions. The court prohibited expansion of Cedar Knoll after June 1, 1989. Further, by\nAugust 1, 1989, the District was to reduce the waiting time for group or shelter home space to no more than ten\ndays. Memorandum Order \"E\" also imposed monetary fines of $100 a day per child for violations at each facility\nand $1,000 a day for violation of the single room cap at either facility. To assure compliance the District was\ndirected to submit monthly reports, the Panel was to establish a priority list of services needed by the Jerry M.\nclass, and the Monitor was to use the fines to implement the service list developed by the Panel.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER \"F,\" dated July 27, 1989, denied the District's motion for a stay of provisions of Order\n\"E,\" including payment of the fines and the delegations of authority to the Panel and the Monitor. While\nacknowledging the District's substantial compliance in hiring staff, the judge noted its failures to reduce\ninstitutional populations.\n[17] The District's appeal of Memorandum Order \"A\" is timely based on its notice of appeal, dated May 9, 1988.\nThe time for appeal was tolled while the trial court considered the District's timely motion to alter or amend its\norder. D.C. App.R. 4(a)(2) (1989). The trial judge denied the District's motion in an order dated April 8, 1988. The\nDistrict then had until Sunday, May 8, 1988, to file a timely notice of appeal. The period to file a notice of appeal\nwas extended to Monday, May 9, 1988, because the last day of the filing period was a Sunday. D.C.App.R. 26(a)\n(1989).\n[18] The Consent Decree provided: \n[t]he parties will not seek a stay of, or appeal from, those portions of the order affirming the Panel's plan, except\nthat neither party waives the right, if any exists, to seek a stay of or appeal from those portions which modify the\nfinal plan submitted to the court by the Panel.\n[19] The Superior Court was not a party and was therefore not bound by the Consent Decree.\n[20] Specifically, the District contends that the Consent Decree does not authorize five twelvebed decentralized\nsecure programs for violent chronic offenders or a reduction in the number of committed delinquents in residential\ntreatment outside the geographic parameters of the District to more than sixty; the trial court has no authority to\norder system-wide improvements in the internal operations and case management system of the Youth Services\nAdministration (YSA).\n\n[21] As appellees point out, deference is due here because the Decree was open-ended to the extent that it\ncreated a mechanism for creating a continuum of community based facilities, and because it involved options and\ncases of a kind familiar to Family Division judges, and the trial judge had posed a series of questions to the\nparties about their intent before accepting their agreement.\n[22] Article II(L) of the Decree provided that three years after its entry the District could move for dissolution of the\nmonitorship, which appellees would not oppose upon a showing \"of sustained and satisfactory implementation\nand substantial compliance in all areas of the Decree.\"\n[23] Appellees' brief, filed November 27, 1989, points out that still unfulfilled are the District's promises to close\nCedar Knoll, improve conditions at Oak Hill and the Receiving Home, upgrade educational programs, medical\ncare and mental health treatment, and reduce institutional populations.\n[24] Nearly thirty years ago, a juvenile court judge, and now senior judge of the Superior Court of the District of\nColumbia, observed that if the promise of the juvenile court is to be fulfilled 00 that is, that the substitution of state\n97\ncontrol for parental control premised on the assumption that the state will act in the best interests of the child and\nthat its intervention will affirmatively enhance the child's welfare 00 then \"the mantle of leadership\" falls on the\n97\njudges involved with juvenile proceedings to assure that the state keep its part of the bargain. Orman W.\nKetcham, \"The Unfulfilled Promise of the Juvenile Court,\" Crime and Delinquency, April 1961, National Council on\nCrime and Delinquency (N.Y.N.Y.), at 100, 110.\n[25] The Consent Decree itself contained elaborate provisions for reform of YSA secure confinement facilities.\n[26] Thus, when the Panel stated that \"The District should close Oak Hill and Cedar Knoll and replace these\ninstitutions with a broad array of alternatives, because we know that there is a better way to treat youth 00 even\n97\nviolent and serious offenders00than in large institutions,\" it expressed sentiments with which many might agree\n97\nbut which are nowhere embodied in the Consent Decree. \nWe do not agree with the District that the Panel's plan for secure beds is tantamount to closing the Oak Hill\nfacility. The Panel's plan called for a total of 102 secure spaces0042 for detained youths and 60 for committed\n97\nyouths. The proposed decentralized facilities would not absorb the entire confined population. In addition, the trial\njudge only directed the District to plan for a system with 60 securely confined delinquents and did not ultimately\ndetermine whether the additional decentralized programs would be used in addition to, or instead of, other secure\nfacilities. In any event, the parties had agreed only to close Cedar Knoll, not Oak Hill.\n[27] The Consent Decree sets limits on the ratio of staff to youth in certain categories, such as cottage life 1:10;\ntreatment team leaders to youth 1:100 and 1:300, respectively; recreation specialists to youth 1:50; social\nworkers to youth 1:40; special education teachers to youth 1:10; and regular academic teachers to youth 1:15.\n[28] As pointed in D.D. v. M.T.:\nCourts have a right to demand, and do insist upon, full and unstinting compliance with their commands. One who\nis subject to a court order has the obligation to obey it honestly and fairly, and to take all necessary steps to\nrender it effective.... Indeed, he or she must be diligent and energetic in carrying out the orders of the court, and a\ntoken effort to comply will not do.\nId. (citations omitted).\n[29] The District's contention that the trial court has only three options open to it, to accept the proposed\nsettlement, to reject it and postpone trial to see if a different settlement can be arranged, or to try the case, is\nrelevant only at the stage when the trial judge was presented with the parties' agreement, on July 17, 1986.\nHaving accepted the parties' agreement, with modifications to which they also agreed, on July 24, 1986, the\nissue facing the judge more than three years later was how to coerce the District into complying with the Decree.\nThe options available to a trial judge in order to coerce compliance are numerous even if not unlimited.\n[30] The trial judge not only invoked the procedures in the Decree affording the parties the first opportunity to\nresolve differences among themselves, but also afforded the District additional time to resolve its differences with\n\nappellees before imposing his own resolution. Appellees passed up opportunities under which it could have\nsought to have held the District in contempt under the Decree. See Consent Decree ¶ II(G). Hence, the District's\nattempt to attack the trial judge's remedial order on the ground that he was required to use the Decree dispute-\nresolving procedures first, and that the Decree limited the circumstances under which contempt could be sought\nby appellees, must fail.\n[31] The trial judge held hearings on the potential harm to the class meant to benefit from the Decree before\nfashioning his conclusions about appropriate remedial orders. Those hearings, as well as other evidence in the\nrecord, including the Panel's report, see note 11, supra, and the dangers encountered by youth at the District's\nsecure facilities which caused appellees to seek emergency relief from the court to reduce overcrowding at the\nChildren's Center, see note 16, supra, leave no room for this court to find that the trial judge failed to make the\nnecessary findings before issuing his remedial order.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "580 A.2d 1270 (1990)\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., Appellants,\nv.\nJERRY M., et al., Appellees.\nNo. 89-1371.\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals.\nArgued June 26, 1990.\nDecided September 5, 1990.\n1272 *1272 James C. McKay, Jr., Asst. Corp. Counsel, with whom Herbert O. Reid, Sr., Corp. Counsel, and Charles L.\nReischel, Deputy Corp. Counsel, Washington, D.C., were on the brief, for appellants.\nDavid A. Reiser, Public Defender Service, and Donna L. Wulkan, with whom Kim Taylor and James Klein, Public\nDefender Service, Washington, D.C., were on the brief, for appellees.\nBefore ROGERS, Chief Judge, and SCHWELB and FARRELL, Associate Judges.\nFARRELL, Associate Judge:\nThis case is before us on appeal from the trial court's award of $63,497.58 in attorney's fees to Donna Wulkan for\nher work between June 8, 1988 and June 29, 1989, in enforcing the District of Columbia's compliance with a\nconsent decree in the matter of the complex and lengthy \"Jerry M.\" litigation. See District of Columbia v. Jerry M.,\n571 A.2d 178 (D.C.1990). We hold that Ms. Wulkan's services are fully compensable under 42 U.S.C. § 1988\n(1982), but vacate the award in part and remand to the trial court for further findings as to the reasonableness of\nthe fee award.\nI.\nThe trial judge entered judgment on the consent decree following a class action filed on behalf of detained and\ncommitted juveniles, challenging the conditions under which they are confined at secure facilities maintained by\nthe District of Columbia. The suit \"alleg[ed] the failure of the District of Columbia and those officials responsible\nfor administering the juvenile facilities... to provide appropriate care, rehabilitation, and treatment to them in\nviolation of the Constitution and the District of Columbia Code.\" Jerry M., supra, 571 A.2d at 180. The suit was\noriginally brought by Donna Wulkan, an attorney and the fee claimant here, as next friend on behalf of Jerry M.,\nand by other named plaintiffs representative of the class. At that time, the class was represented by the Public\nDefender Service (PDS) and the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n[1]\nFollowing judgment on the consent decree,  plaintiffs' counsel moved to add Wulkan as attorney for the plaintiff\nclass. By order of the trial court in February 1988, Wulkan became one of the attorneys for the plaintiff class that\nwere monitoring compliance with the decree. By the time Wulkan entered her appearance in the case, the\nmonitor appointed to oversee the District's compliance with the decree had reported several violations. Wulkan\nthen took part in a series of efforts to enforce the District's adherence to the decree.\nOn May 6, 1988, appellees filed a motion for emergency relief to reduce overcrowding. After attempts at\nmediation failed, the trial judge issued Memorandum Order \"C\" on October 15, 1988, directing the District to\nimplement measures to remedy overcrowding and understaffing. See Jerry M., supra, 571 A.2d at 183 n. 16. In\naddition, appellees filed a motion for a temporary restraining order enjoining unhealthy environmental conditions,\nand another to prevent continuing violations of the educational provisions of the consent decree. The court\ngranted the first motion and referred the matter of violation of the education provisions to the monitor in\naccordance with mandatory mediation provisions of the decree. The court gave the parties until September 30,\n1988 to determine whether the dispute could be settled without court intervention, and directed the monitor to\n\nsubmit findings and recommendations by October 4 if it could be resolved. Although the monitor submitted\n1273 findings and recommendations, the plaintiffs advised *1273 him that the dispute could not be resolved through\nthe mediation process.\nIn February 1988, after a critical report from an expert retained by the monitor to evaluate the state of medical\ncare and recommend specific improvements, the District agreed to a Corrective Action Plan implementing the\nexpert's recommendations by June 1988. In October 1988, the monitor reported that \"implementation [of the plan\nto improve medical care] appears to be at an impasse. Improvement has been slow in some areas, nonexistent in\nothers; in some areas, medical services have worsened.\"\nIn December of 1988, appellees filed a motion for an order directing appellants to show cause why appellants\nshould not be held in civil contempt for not complying with the medical, educational, staffing, and inmate\npopulation requirements of the consent decree, and with Memorandum Order \"C.\" After denying appellants'\nmotion to alter or amend Memorandum Order \"C\", the trial judge, on March 10, 1989, held the District in civil\ncontempt upon finding that it had violated population limit provisions of the decree and certain provisions of\n[2]\nMemorandum Order \"C.\"  He deferred action on the motion with respect to the medical care provisions until\nafter an evidentiary hearing, held in July 1989, where testimony was taken from members of the District's medical\nstaff and public health officials and from an expert hired by appellees. On September 28, 1989, the judge entered\nMemorandum Order \"H\" finding that the District's failure to implement certain professional medical standards was\n\"contumacious conduct,\" but that other asserted failures of compliance with the decree did not support a finding\nof civil contempt.\nWith respect to the educational provisions, appellees' contempt motion alleged that the District had failed to\ncomply with certain of the monitor's recommendations, while acknowledging that some of the short term\nrecommendations had been satisfied. The judge ordered the District to show cause why it should not be held in\ncontempt and conducted a hearing on April 3, 1990. On April 13, the District submitted an affidavit from the\nDirector of the Department of Human Services detailing specific actions the \"Department is undertaking to ensure\ncompliance with the Consent Decree's provisions governing education, outplacement and suicide prevention.\" On\nJuly 2, 1990, the judge issued Memorandum Order \"I\" which, among other things, found the District to be in\ncompliance with the decree provision regarding special education but out of compliance with multiple other\neducational provisions of the decree.\nMs. Wulkan's name appeared on most of the motions to enforce compliance. Up to June 3, 1988, the District\nvoluntarily paid her $11,618.00 in attorney's fees but stated for the record that it was doing so without admitting\nher entitlement to such fees. In May of 1989, Wulkan filed a motion for additional attorney's fees under the Civil\nRights Attorney's Fees Award Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, which authorizes an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing\nparty who sought to enforce provisions of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The District opposed the request\nbut the judge, after finding that Wulkan had provided \"valuable and competent legal services\" to the plaintiff\nclass, granted the request for fees in all but minor respects. The District appeals from that order.\nII.\nGenerally, parties to a civil action must bear their own attorney's fees absent a contrary contractual provision or\n\"specific and explicit [statutory] provisions for the allowance of attorney's fees.\" Schlank v. Williams, 572 A.2d\n101, 108 (D.C.1990),quoting Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 260, 95 S.Ct. 1612,\n1274 1623, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). As pointed out, Wulkan sought fees under the *1274 Civil Rights Attorney's Fees\nAward Act, which provides in part:\nIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section [] ... 1983 ... of this title, the court, in\nits discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's\nfee as part of the costs.\n42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\nA. Availability of Fees for Enforcement of a Consent Decree\nThe District contends that § 1988 does not authorize a fee award in this case because, in enforcing the\nprovisions of the consent decree through various motions, Wulkan did not seek to enforce § 1983 claims alleging\ndeprivation of federal or constitutional rights, but rather sought to vindicate rights deriving solely from District of\nColumbia law. The District asks the court to focus on the \"alleged violations of the consent decree for which\n[Wulkan] claims fees\" and the absence in those allegations of any claimed infirmity under the United States\nConstitution or federal law.\nIt is true that Wulkan's May 6, 1988 Motion for Emergency Relief challenging overcrowding and other conditions\nat the Children's Center was premised on alleged violations of the consent decree and various provisions of the\nD.C.Code and Superior Court Juvenile Division rules. Similarly, later motions seeking to enforce compliance with\nprovisions of the consent decree concerning educational services and medical care did not explicitly allege\n[3]\ndeprivations of constitutional or federal rights.  Nevertheless, we do not agree that § 1988 authorizes fees only\nto the extent that alleged violations of the consent decree themselves constitute deprivations of constitutional or\nfederal rights.\nA plaintiff is a \"prevailing party\" within the meaning of § 1988 if he or she succeeds in obtaining relief by way of a\nsettlement agreement or consent decree; \"[n]othing in the language of § 1988 conditions [the court's] power to\naward fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that the plaintiff's rights have been\nviolated.\" Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). To be deemed a\n\"prevailing party,\" it is necessary only that the plaintiff \"succeed on any significant issue in litigation which\nachieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit.\" Allen v. District of Columbia, 503 A.2d 1233,\n1236 (D.C.1986),quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983),\nin turn quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.1978) (emphasis in Allen). See also Texas\nState Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 1491-93, 103 L.Ed.2d\n866 (1989) (endorsing Hensley/Nadeau formulation).\nIn Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council, 478 U.S. 546, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986), the\nSupreme Court held that a statutory fee provision analogous to § 1988 authorized fees for efforts to enforce\ncompliance with a consent decree in an administrative proceeding. The Court reasoned that \"[p]rotection of the\nfull scope of relief afforded by the consent decree was ... crucial to safeguard the interests asserted [by the\nplaintiff],\" and \"[i]n a case of this kind, measures necessary to enforce the remedy ordered by the District Court\ncannot be divorced from the matters upon which [the plaintiff] prevailed in securing the consent decree.\" Id. at\n558-59, 106 S.Ct. at 3095. The Court observed that \"several courts have held that, in the context of [§ 1988],\n1275 post-judgment monitoring of a consent decree *1275 is a compensable activity for which counsel is entitled to a\nreasonable fee.\" Id. at 559, 106 S.Ct. at 3095, citing Garrity v. Sununu, 752 F.2d 727, 738-39 (1st Cir. 1984); \nBond v. Stanton, 630 F.2d 1231, 1233 (7th Cir.1980); Miller v. Carson, 628 F.2d 346, 348 (5th Cir.1980); \nNorthcross v. Board of Education, 611 F.2d 624, 637 (6th Cir.1979),cert. denied,447 U.S. 911, 100 S.Ct. 2999,\n64 L.Ed.2d 862 (1980).\nThese and other decisions recognize that, oftentimes, a consent decree \"represent[s] only a beginning. Without\ndetermined, competent and dedicated representation, the provisions of [the c]onsent [d]ecree might have little\npractical significance for the class members.\" Duran v. Carruthers, 885 F.2d 1492, 1496 (10th Cir.1989),quoting \nBrewster v. Dukakis, 544 F.Supp. 1069, 1072 (D.Mass.1982),modified on other grounds,786 F.2d 16 (1st\nCir.1986). Whenever \"[p]erseverance and a watchful eye [have] led to the filing of a motion for contempt,\" \nMcDonald v. Armontrout, 860 F.2d 1456, 1461 (8th Cir.1988), in turn assuring \"protection of the full scope of the\nrelief afforded by the consent decree ... crucial to safeguard the interests [of the plaintiff class],\" Delaware Valley,\nsupra, 478 U.S. at 558, 106 S.Ct. at 3095 (emphasis added), those activities are compensable under § 1988.\nHere, the class plaintiffs sought a broad range of relief on a variety of claims, some founded on constitutional and\nfederal law and others on District of Columbia law. They achieved the benefit sought by the entire action by way\nof a judgment entered on a consent decree rather than on the merits of the individual claims. That the measures\n\nrequired by the decree may have exceeded minimum constitutional standards does not mean they bore no\nrelation to the constitutional claims asserted under § 1983 in the complaint. As alleged in the various motions to\ncompel compliance, the District's widespread disregard of its obligations under the decree threatened the relief\nattained in the decree addressing conditions plaintiffs had alleged violated their constitutional rights. \"Efforts to\nmonitor compliance with a consent judgment `cannot be severed from the matters upon which the plaintiff\nprevailed' by obtaining the consent judgment.\" Turner v. Orr, 785 F.2d 1498, 1503 (11th Cir.1986),quoting Adams\nv. Mathis, 752 F.2d 553, 554 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam). Whether or not violation of the decree's provisions rose\nto the level of a denial of constitutional or federal rights, the decree as a whole served to provide relief for the full\narray of plaintiffs' claims.\nNot only were the § 1983 claims joined with others based on District of Columbia law in the complaint, but the\nfactual allegations underlying both classes of claims were, for the most part, identical. Thus, there is nothing to\nsuggest that the § 1983 claims were resolved against the plaintiffs or otherwise vanished at the moment the court\napproved the settlement. Even if the provisions of the decree Wulkan sought to enforce represented success only\non claims founded on District of Columbia law, this would not defeat plaintiffs' right to fees under § 1988.\nSuccessful state-based claims may also support a fee award provided they are joined with unresolved substantial\nconstitutional or federal claims which arise from a common nucleus of operative facts with the state-based\nclaims. Allen v. District of Columbia, supra, 503 A.2d at 1237,citing Maher v. Gagne, supra, 448 U.S. at 132, 100\nS.Ct. at 2576. Plaintiffs' allegations regarding physical conditions and educational and medical services gave rise\nto both constitutional and non-constitutional claims. Thus, even assuming the settlement secured relief for\nplaintiffs on the local statutory claims only, fees would still be authorized under § 1988.\nHowever, although § 1988 does not condition a fee award on an adjudication of a constitutional claim in the\nplaintiff's favor, merely to invoke the federal constitution in a complaint does not entitle a prevailing party to\nattorney's fees when the claim remains unaddressed; \"[i]f a litigant could obtain fees simply by an incantation of §\n1983, fees would become available in almost every case.\" Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1003, 1007, 104\n1276 S.Ct. 3457, *1276 3463-64, 3465-66, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984). As we now develop, the undecided constitutional\nclaims must be \"substantial\" in the sense that they would support federal subject-matter jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1331 (1988) if brought in federal court, Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577\n(1974); and the ultimate relief attained must be reasonably related to those claims. Smith, supra, 468 U.S. at\n1007, 104 S.Ct. at 3465-66.\nB. Constitutional \"Substantiality\"\nThe first of these two requirements is \"an extremely lenient one,\" Grano v. Barry, 251 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 296, 783\nF.2d 1104, 1111 (1986), deriving from the test for federal subject-matter jurisdiction over constitutional claims set\nforth in Hagans v. Lavine, supra:\n\"Constitutional insubstantiality\" for this purpose has been equated with such concepts as\n\"essentially fictitious,\" ... \"wholly insubstantial,\" ... \"obviously frivolous,\" ... and \"obviously without\nmerit.\" ... A claim is insubstantial only if \"`its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous\ndecisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the\nquestions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.'\"\n415 U.S. at 537-38, 94 S.Ct. at 1379; quoting Ex Parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 4-5, 78 L.Ed. 152\n(1933) (citations omitted).\nIn Maher v. Gagne, supra, the Supreme Court acknowledged the Hagans substantiality formulation in holding\nattorney's fees under § 1988 authorized when the plaintiff alleged constitutional claims substantial enough to\nsupport subject-matter jurisdiction, despite the fact that those claims were not adjudicated and ended in a\nsettlement. 448 U.S. at 128 n. 10, 131-32, 100 S.Ct. at 2574 n. 10, 2575-76. Noting the prominence of the \nHagans test in the legislative history accompanying § 1988, the Court observed that \"Congress intended fees to\nbe awarded where a pendent constitutional claim is involved, even if the... claim on which the plaintiff prevailed is\n\none for which fees cannot be awarded under the Act.\" Id. at 132 n. 15, 100 S.Ct. at 2576 n. 15, citing H.R.REP.\n[4]\nNo. 94-1558 (1976).\nDespite the Court's apparent acceptance of the Hagans test in Maher, the District argues that this court is free to\nadopt a more rigorous definition of substantiality because the meaning of that concept was not at issue in Maher.\nAs pointed out previously, however, Maher concluded that \"[n]othing in the language of § 1988 conditions [the\ncourt's] power to award fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that the plaintiff's rights\nhave been violated.\" Id. at 129, 100 S.Ct. at 2575. The District itself concedes that \"Maher ... reflects a\ndetermination that the constitutional claim need not be found meritorious.\" But to accept the District's proposed\nstandard of a showing of \"some real substance\" to constitutional claims beyond what Hagans' \"not clearly\nforeclosed by prior decisions\" formulation demands, would require in practice the same inquiry into the merits\nthat Maher understood Congress not to have intended at the attorney's fee stage. As Maher recognized,\nCongress provided for attorney's fees without a decision on the merits of a constitutional claim if the claim was\nnot frivolous and the plaintiff prevailed on a factually-related nonconstitutional claim; it did so to avoid penalizing a\nplaintiff when the trial court has followed the prudential course of deciding a case on non-constitutional grounds. \nId. at 132 n. 15, 100 S.Ct. at 2576 n. 15, quoting H.R.REP. No. 94-1558, supra, at 4 n. 7. There is surely no\nreason to adopt a more rigorous standard where the defendant has avoided trial of both the constitutional and\n[5]\nnon-constitutional claims by agreeing to a settlement.\n1277 *1277 What the District desires, in essence, is a requirement of proof of likely success on the merits, a standard\nakin to that for obtaining a preliminary injunction. We agree with the United States Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, however, that the Maher/Hagans standard\nrequires courts to dismiss fee claims based on wholly frivolous lawsuits, but simultaneously\nconstrains them from holding a full trial, or from making ad hoc predictions about the plaintiff's\nchance for success, on the merits. The court may only consider whether claimant's action is\nfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\nMiller v. Staats, 227 U.S.App.D.C. 299, 304 n. 31, 706 F.2d 336, 341 n. 31 (1983) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted; emphasis added). In Miller the court remanded the fee claim because the trial court had denied\nfees on the ground that claimants had not made out \"any sufficient threshold showing of real discrimination\"\nagainst certain government workers, a test the appellate court concluded \"appears to hold fee claimants to a\nhigher standard than the law requires.\" Id. at 305, 706 F.2d at 342. We agree with that conclusion.\nAccordingly, we must examine whether the constitutional claims of the plaintiff class were substantial under the \nMaher/Hagans standard. We hold that the complaint satisfies that test. Count I alleged that the totality of the\nconditions at the District's juvenile facilities violated the right of confined juveniles to be free of harm,\nunnecessary restraint, and cruel and unusual punishment secured by the Fifth and Eighth Amendments; Count II\nalleged that the failure to provide adequate educational services violated the Fifth and Eighth Amendments;\nCount III claimed that the failure to provide adequate medical services violated the right of confined children to\nrehabilitative treatment, secured by the Fifth Amendment, and their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights to be kept\nfree from harm; Count IV alleged that the failure to provide safe and humane living conditions violated the Fifth\nand Eighth Amendments; Count V alleged that the lack of adequate vocational training, counseling and social\nservices, and parental visitation violated the Fifth Amendment right to rehabilitative treatment; Count VI claimed\nthat the District's failure to provide adequate facilities for consultation with attorneys violated the Fifth\nAmendment; and Count VII alleged that the climate of violence within the institutions caused by the District's\nneglect violated the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.\nThe fact that each count except Count VI also alleged violation of rights created under the District of Columbia\nCode does not reveal the constitutional claims as spurious or without substance. In the aggregate, the allegations\nconstituted a claim that the District was confining juveniles for a purpose and in a manner inconsistent with\nfundamental due process. A recurrent theme in the complaint is the asserted deprivation of confined juveniles'\nFifth Amendment right to rehabilitative treatment. We need not decide whether such a right exists or its scope; it\n1278 is enough to point out that several federal courts have recognized the right[6] and that the District cites us to \n*1278 nothing in Supreme Court decisions expressly or impliedly rejecting it. It has been argued that, to meet\n\nconstitutional demands, \"the nature ... of confinement must bear a reasonable relation to the purpose of the\nintervention,\" and that \"[m]ere custodial confinement without treatment bears no relationship to the rehabilitative\npurpose of the juvenile system.\" R. HOROWITZ & H. DAVIDSON, LEGAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN, § 11.37, at\n506 (1984). The argument is not frivolous. See Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1858, 32\n[7]\nL.Ed.2d 435 (1972).  In the District of Columbia, the dual ends of juvenile justice00 treatment and rehabilitation,\n97\nas opposed to punishment00inform the statutory scheme governing juveniles. See In re L.J., 546 A.2d 429, 437\n97\n(D.C.1988) (\"the District of Columbia is firmly committed to a rehabilitative approach to juvenile justice\"). What\n\"makes a juvenile proceeding fundamentally different from an adult criminal trial,\" Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253,\n263, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 2409, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984), is \"the strong government interest in determining the\ntreatment required to rehabilitate youthful offenders.\" In re L.M., 432 A.2d 692, 694 (D.C.1981). See also In re\nC.W.M., 407 A.2d 617, 622 (D.C.1979); District of Columbia v. P.L.M., 325 A.2d 600, 604 (D.C.1974).\nRelying on these principles, plaintiffs here asserted that the conditions of confinement of juveniles in the District's\ninstitutions 00alleged to include no efforts at rehabilitation through education, counseling, vocational training and\n97\nother services, and to place children at unnecessary risk of physical and emotional harm00amounted to\n97\npunishment, a constitutionally invalid goal of confinement of persons denied procedural rights of adult\ndefendants. Whatever the ultimate merits of that claim, to satisfy Hagans it is enough that it is not foreclosed by\n[8]\nany apparent binding authority.  Other claims of the plaintiffs relating to the failure to provide medical care,\nfailure to prevent physical abuse, and use of physical restraints allege violations of \"constitutionally protected\ninterests in conditions of reasonable care and safety [and] reasonably nonrestrictive confinement conditions\"\nrecognized by the Supreme Court in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.Ed.2d\n28 (1982) (commitment of mentally retarded). In the context of juvenile confinement, these claims too are\nsubstantial within the meaning of Hagans.\nC. Causal Relation\nAs stated earlier, unadjudicated constitutional claims must satisfy an additional requirement to permit an award of\nattorney's fees under § 1988: the relief obtained must be related to those claims. Smith v. Robinson, supra, 468\nU.S. at 1006, 104 S.Ct. at 3465. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has\nexplained this relation by saying that § 1983 claims must have \"served as catalysts in securing the result\"\n1279 achieved by *1279 the class plaintiffs. Grano v. Barry, supra, 251 U.S.App.D.C. at 295, 783 F.2d at 1110.\nIn making this causal inquiry ... courts [should] consider the chronological sequence of events and\ndraw conclusions from the facts at hand.... From this sequence of events, the court must\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that [the] fee claimant['s] participation contributed to\ndefendant's action [in settling] 00so that the relief granted cannot be ascribed to other influences.\n97\nMiller v. Staats, supra, 227 U.S.App.D.C. at 304 n. 32, 706 F.2d at 341 n. 32 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). These statements fairly explicate the causation standard. See also S.D. v. Faulkner, 705\nF.Supp. 1361, 1364-65 (S.D.Ind. 1989).\nThe District's consent to implement the provisions of the settlement can be traced in substantial measure to the\nclaims alleged for which fees could be awarded under § 1988. The decree states that it was being submitted for\nthe court's approval to \"resolve the issues in C.A. 1519-85,\" the class action. Moreover, there is substantial\nidentity between the requested relief from conditions generating those claims and the provisions of the decree. In\nits prayer for injunctive relief, the complaint sought to compel the District: to provide appropriate, humane, and\nsafe living conditions in residential units; to provide adequate educational services (for both the general\npopulation and educationally handicapped children), including compliance with the Education of the Handicapped\nAct; to provide adequate medical, counseling and mental health services and vocational training; to provide staff\ntraining and supervision of residents and take other steps to prevent counselor assaults on residents and resident\nassaults on other residents in the detention facilities; to promulgate and ensure staff compliance with proper\ndisciplinary procedures; to provide adequate recreational services; and to adopt procedures necessary to ensure\ndetained and committed children adequate opportunities for family visits and consultation with legal counsel. The\ndecree memorializes the District's agreement to address many of these conditions by \"requiring housing\n\n[population] limitations, minimum standards for staffing and training, improvements in diagnostic services,\ntreatment planning through individual service plans (ISP) and Team Leaders, as well as education, recreational,\nand mental health services and medical services,\" Jerry M., supra, 571 A.2d at 181 & nn. 8, 9, and family\nvisitation and attorney consultation procedures.\nIn Smith v. Robinson, supra, the Supreme Court reasoned that where fee claimants \"present[] distinctly different\nclaims for different relief, based on different facts and legal theories, and have prevailed only on a nonfee claim,\nthey are not entitled to a fee award simply because the other claim was a constitutional claim that could be\nasserted through § 1983.\" 468 U.S. at 1015, 104 S.Ct. at 3470. Here, in sharp contrast, the plaintiffs sought the\nsame relief under both their fee and non-fee-generating claims00claims predicated on exactly the same facts.\n97\nBecause the issues were resolved by a consent decree giving the class substantially the relief requested, it\ncannot be said that plaintiffs \"prevailed only on a nonfee claim.\" In agreeing to be bound by the decree, the\nDistrict spared itself the \"time, expense and inevitable risk of litiga[ting]\" both the nonfee claims and the § 1983\nclaims as well. Jerry M., supra, 571 A.2d at 185,quoting Brown v. Nebb, 644 F.2d 551, 557 (6th Cir.1981).\nPlaintiffs thus satisfied the causation requirement as well.\nIII.\nThe District further contends that, even if § 1988 permits attorney's fees for Ms. Wulkan's efforts to enforce the\nconsent decree, the fee award must be vacated and remanded because the trial judge abused his discretion in\nawarding fees that compensated activities by Wulkan which duplicated the services of other attorneys staffing the\ncase. The District argues, at a minimum, that the judge failed adequately to explain the reasons supporting his\n1280 virtually complete grant of Wulkan's request, particularly in light of the District's detailed *1280 opposition filed\nbelow. We find merit in the latter point, and thus conclude that a remand is necessary for a fuller statement of the\njudge's reasoning specifically addressing the District's claim that at least some of Wulkan's services were\nunnecessary and duplicated those of PDS attorneys. Our disposition, however, is without prejudice to an\nimmediate application by Wulkan in the Superior Court for an order directing partial payment of the fee\nrequested. We leave the determination of any such amount to the judge, noting only our opinion that a partial\ninterim award appears justified.\nA.\nAfter entering her appearance as an attorney in February 1988, Wulkan submitted two invoices for fees to the\nDistrict which it disputed. A settlement was reached with the court's approval whereby the District, without\nconceding Wulkan was entitled to fees for monitoring compliance with the decree, agreed to pay her a total of\n$11,618.00 for work performed between February 8 and June 3, 1988. On May 1, 1989, Wulkan filed a motion for\nattorney's fees and costs seeking payment for services rendered from June 3, 1988 forward. In opposing the\nmotion, the District argued that (1) Wulkan was not entitled to claim fees because only the ACLU had reserved\n[9]\nthe right to fees in the consent decree;  (2) fees were available for enforcement of the decree only to the extent\nthe District's alleged noncompliance violated federal or constitutional rights; (3) the fee sought was unreasonable\nbecause it duplicated services performed by PDS attorneys and requested fees for unnecessary and excessive\nwork, and (4) the fee application was insufficiently detailed to permit assessment of the reasonableness of the\nfees claimed.\nThe judge entered an order granting the fee motion almost entirely. He correctly rejected the District's arguments\n(1) and (2) above, and as to the argument that Wulkan's documentation was insufficiently detailed, found the\ndetail \"sufficient to permit a reasonable person to make an informed judgment regarding the reasons for the fees\ncharged.\" As to the claim of duplicative and excessive work, the judge stated:\nSome of the defendants' concerns expressed about Ms. Wulkan's billing practices as an attorney\nmember of the plaintiff's team of lawyers fail[] to recognize the complex nature of the plaintiffs'\ntask. Defendants' failure to date to comply with substantial portions of the Consent Decree\nunderscores one dimension of the difficulty of the undertaking. The plaintiffs have been scrupulous\n\nin attempting to ensure that the Youth Services Administration discharges its responsibilities to the\ncitizens of the District of Columbia and the young people entrusted to its care. Ms. Wulkan's\nparticipation as a plaintiff's team member has thus far proven important, constructive and\nproductive.\nDefendants are correct when they argue that some of Ms. Wulkan's time for which she is now\nclaiming fees, is time spent in consultation with other members of plaintiffs' team of attorneys. The\nCourt, having reviewed carefully Ms. Wulkan's fee application finds that the time spent conferring\nwith co-counsel is well within reasonable limits. The Court finds defendants' concern to be a valid\none, however, and cautions Ms. Wulkan to continue to exercise the same judgment evident in the\napplication under consideration.\nB.\nDetermining the amount of a \"reasonable\" attorney's fee under § 1988 is a matter within the trial judge's\ndiscretion. Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941; Henderson v. District of Columbia,\n1281 493 A.2d 982, 999 (D.C. *1281 1985). The deference due that discretion is probably at its zenith when, as here,\nthe judge has been absorbed in (if not consumed by) the litigation in question for years. But, although the\nappellate court must defer to the judge's \"superior understanding\" of the matters for which fees are sought, \nHensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941, the judge does not enjoy unqualified discretion in fixing the fee\namount. The legislative history and case law associated with § 1988 set forth boundaries that00as in the case of\n97\nmany exercises of discretion00limit \"the range of permissible alternatives\" and \"enumerat[e] the factors the court\n97\nmay or should consider.\" Johnson v. United States, 398 A.2d 354, 365 (D.C.1979). In Hensley and Blum v.\nStenson, 465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984), the Supreme Court fashioned a calculus which, if\ncarefully applied, leads to a presumptively \"reasonable\" fee under § 1988. This court summarized and applied\nthose standards in Henderson v. District of Columbia, supra.\nThe initial burden of showing that fees claimed are reasonable falls upon the fee claimant. Blum, supra, 465 U.S.\nat 897, 104 S.Ct. at 1548. After determining whether the fee claimant is a prevailing party, the judge should\ncompute the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation, excluding any claimed hours that are\nexcessive, redundant, or unnecessary. Henderson, supra, 493 A.2d at 999,citing Hensley, supra, 461 U.S. at\n434, 103 S.Ct. at 1939-40. As the Court recognized in Hensley, \"cases may be overstaffed,\" 461 U.S. at 434, 103\nS.Ct. at 1939-40, and thus \"[c]ompiling raw totals of hours spent ... does not complete the inquiry. It does not\nfollow that the amount of time actually expended is the amount of time reasonably expended.\" Copeland v.\nMarshall, 205 U.S.App.D.C. 390, 401, 641 F.2d 880, 891-92 (1980) (en banc) (emphasis in original). Accord, \nDistrict of Columbia v. Hunt, 525 A.2d 1015, 1016 (D.C.1987) (per curiam). Next, the judge must decide what\nconstitutes a reasonable hourly rate for the services rendered, as measured by prevailing market rates in the\nrelevant community for attorneys of similar experience and skill. Henderson, supra, 493 A.2d at 999. Lastly,\nmultiplying these two figures yields a \"lodestar\" amount, id., which is \"presumed to be the reasonable fee\n[10]\ncontemplated by § 1988.\" Blum, supra, 465 U.S. at 897, 104 S.Ct. at 1548.\nHensley and other authorities teach that a vital step in calculating the lodestar00indeed, the first step00is the\n97 97\nexclusion of hours that are redundant or unnecessary. In its opposition below, the District raised specific\nquestions concerning unnecessary duplication of effort by Wulkan. It noted that PDS had staffed the case at the\nenforcement stage with no fewer than four attorneys, that Wulkan attended court hearings \"where three, and\nsometimes four other attorneys for plaintiffs [were] also present,\" and that on these occasions lead counsel\n\"appear[ed] usually to be [a PDS attorney].\" It cited seven instances of hearings for which Wulkan claimed fees\n[11]\nwhere she allegedly played at most a secondary role.  In their brief, appellees assert that \"Ms. Wulkan\n1282 assumed primary*1282responsibility for drafting pleadings, conducting discovery, and representing the plaintiff\nclass in connection with issues relating to medical care and education\" (emphasis added); from a similar\nunderstanding below the District argued that her role was subordinate in regard to other issues of overcrowding\nand understaffing. In its opposition, the District summarized several pages of billings related to her work on these\nissues.\n\nAt oral argument Wulkan argued strongly that her services and fee claims cannot validly be parsed according to\nthe primary and secondary roles she assumed since the compliance issues were all interrelated and the judge\nimpliedly found her services important to each. Hensley, however, requires the trial judge to deal explicitly with\n[12]\nclaims of duplication and redundancy,  and we are not persuaded on this record that the judge's obligation\nwas satisfied by findings merely that, \"having reviewed carefully Ms. Wulkan's fee application[,] ... the time spent\nconferring with co-counsel is well within reasonable limits,\" and given the \"complexity of the plaintiffs' task,\" \"Ms.\nWulkan's participation as a team member has thus far proven important, constructive and productive.\" See \nJohnson v. Georgia Highway Express, supra note 10, 488 F.2d at 717 (\"If more than one attorney is involved, the\npossibility of duplication of effort along with the proper utilization of time should be scrutinized\"); Copeland v.\nMarshall, supra, 205 U.S. App.D.C. at 401, 641 F.2d at 891. Review of fee awards under § 1988 \"requires a\nrecord that elucidates the factors that contributed to the fee decision and upon which it was based,\" Evans v.\nSheraton Park Hotel, 164 U.S.App.D.C. 86, 97, 503 F.2d 177, 188 (1974); see also Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin,\n749 F.2d 945, 950 (1st Cir. 1984) (conclusory statements about reasonableness insufficient to withstand\nappellate review). On remand, the trial judge should address the specific issues of duplication raised by the\nDistrict. We imply no view on the propriety of the fee amount Ms. Wulkan sought or the court awarded; our\nconcern is with the process by which the fees were computed. Consequently, the case is remanded for further\nfindings as to the reasonableness of the fees requested; in all other respects the order appealed from is affirmed.\nSo ordered.\n[1] A detailed description of the specific provisions of the consent decree is set out in our previous opinion\naddressing the propriety of certain orders entered by the court arising from appellees' efforts to enforce the\ndecree. Those facts will not be repeated here. See Jerry M., supra, 571 A.2d at 180-83.\n[2] This court subsequently affirmed the contempt citation but vacated certain aspects of other orders requiring\nthe District to take actions beyond the scope of the consent decree. Jerry M., supra, 571 A.2d at 192.\n[3] This statement is subject to one qualification. Addressing the class plaintiffs' claims that the District had failed\nto provide screening, classification and special education to handicapped children in its charge as required by the\nEducation of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1485 (1988), the consent decree required the District,\namong other measures, \"to comply fully with the requirements of the [EHA] and its implementing regulations by\nSeptember 1, 1987.\" Notwithstanding the incorporation of the EHA into the decree, Wulkan's contempt motions\nrelied on the District's noncompliance with the handicapped education provisions of the decree, rather than\nviolations of federal law.\n[4] In text the Court stated: \"Congress was acting within its enforcement power in allowing the award of fees in a\ncase ... in which both a statutory and a substantial constitutional claim are settled favorably to the plaintiff without\nadjudication.\" 448 U.S. at 132, 100 S.Ct. at 2576.\n[5] The District cites decisions from various states which it says have employed more exacting substantiality tests\nthan Hagans. Some appear to be basically in accord with Hagans. The District relies chiefly on Jackson v. Town\nof Searsport, 456 A.2d 852 (Me.),cert. denied,464 U.S. 825, 104 S.Ct. 95, 78 L.Ed.2d 101 (1983), in which the\ncourt criticized application of the Hagans standard to the \"retrospective inquiry of whether a party has prevailed\nfor purposes of section 1988,\" id. at 855 n. 13, and concluded: \"If a federal claim under the civil rights laws has\nno merit, it cannot serve as the predicate for the imposition of attorney's fees simply because it is appended to a\nvalid state claim.\" Id. at 856. To the extent Jackson (and other cases cited by the District) hold that a\nconstitutional claim actually adjudged meritless cannot support an award of fees on a successful pendent claim\nfor which no fees are authorized, they are consistent with our holding in Allen, supra, that \"[i]f it is determined that\nno constitutional right is violated, the predicate for the award vanishes.\" 503 A.2d at 1236. But, for the reasons\nstated in the text, this rule does not justify reaching the merits of undecided constitutional issues at the terminus\nof a case resolved by a consent decree simply to determine a prevailing party's eligibility for attorney's fees.\n[6]E.g., Nelson v. Heyne, 491 F.2d 352, 358-60 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,417 U.S. 976, 94 S.Ct. 3183, 41 L.Ed.2d\n1146 (1974); Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F.Supp. 1130 (S.D.Miss.1977); Gary W. v. Louisiana, 437 F.Supp. 1209\n\n(E.D.La.1976); Harris v. Bell, 402 F.Supp. 469 (W.D.Mo.1975); Morales v. Turman, 364 F.Supp. 166 (E.D.Tex.\n1973),rev'd on other grounds,535 F.2d 864 (5th Cir.),rev'd and remanded,430 U.S. 322, 97 S.Ct. 1189, 51\nL.Ed.2d 368; on remand, 562 F.2d 993 (5th Cir.1977); Inmates of Boy's Training School v. Affleck, 346 F.Supp.\n1354 (D.R.I.1972); Martarella v. Kelly, 349 F.Supp. 575 (S.D.N.Y.1972). But see, Santana v. Collazo, 714 F.2d\n1172, 1176-77 (1st Cir.1983).\n[7] As one court has stated, citing Jackson v. Indiana, \"[S]ince the State has defined its interest in taking custody\nof delinquent children as rehabilitation, due process requires that the nature of the child's custody bear a relation\nto that rehabilitation.\" State ex rel. R.S. v. Trent, 169 W.Va. 493, 289 S.E.2d 166, 175 (1982).\n[8] Aside from the claims referring to this Fifth Amendment theory, the complaint alleged that certain practices,\nincluding overcrowding, violate the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. While\nthe District argues that such practices as \"double-celling\" have conclusively been established not to constitute\ndeprivation of the Eighth Amendment rights of adult prisoners, see Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 101 S.Ct.\n2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); Inmates of\nOccoquan v. Barry, 269 U.S.App.D.C. 210, 218, 844 F.2d 828, 836 (1988), these authorities do not resolve the\nissue of whether such practices, as applied to juveniles, can constitutionally be reconciled with a system that\ndoes not purport to punish but rather to treat and rehabilitate.\n[9] Relying on this provision, the District asserted that the parties had negotiated a waiver of fees as to the\nACLU's successor, Ms. Wulkan. The trial judge rejected this exclusio unius argument, and we agree that the\nconsent decree reflects no waiver of Wulkan's right to claim fees, or exclusive reservation of the ACLU's right to\ndo so, but is simply silent on the issue of fee claims of other attorneys of the class.\n[10] Because \"there may be circumstances in which the basic standard of reasonable rates multiplied by\nreasonably expended hours results in a fee that is either unreasonably low or unreasonably high,\" Blum, 465\nU.S. at 897, 104 S.Ct. at 1548, after fixing the lodestar the court \"must next turn its attention to upward or\ndownward adjustments thereto.\" Henderson, supra, 493 A.2d at 999. At this point, the trial court may consider a\nmultiplicity of factors, including the twelve considerations articulated in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, 488\nF.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974). The judge must recognize, however, that at least some of those factors may be\nsubsumed in the lodestar. Id. See, e.g., Blum, 465 U.S. at 898-99, 104 S.Ct. at 1548-49 (novelty and complexity\nof issues reflected in the number of hours reasonably expended; quality of representation generally reflected in a\nreasonable hourly rate). Wulkan has made no claim for enhancement of the lodestar amount.\n[11] The District also alleged that Wulkan attended inspection tours of District juvenile facilities by experts in the\ncompany of one or more PDS attorneys. Citing three such instances, it argued that Wulkan could have obtained\nat least a portion of the information she needed from the PDS staff rather than attending these tours herself.\n[12] When Wulkan originally was permitted to enter her appearance as counsel, the judge made no finding\nwhether her services were needed and could not be provided by counsel already in the case, primarily the PDS\nattorneys. The judge cannot be faulted in this regard since the District consented to Wulkan's entry and did not\nrequest any finding of need for her services. We note that absent such a finding, however, the risk of duplication\nof services in a case such as this is substantial.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996), Congress\namended several different titles of the United States Code in a comprehensive effort to curtail the ability of\n[1]\nprisoners to challenge the conditions of their confinement. Section 802 of the PLRA, known as STOP,  severely\nlimited the remedies available to plaintiffs in litigation over prison conditions. See Alexander S. v. Boyd, 113 F.3d\n1373, 1380 (4th Cir.1997),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 118 S.Ct. 880, 139 L.Ed.2d 869 (1998). Section 803(d) of\nthe PLRA amended the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997 et seq., and\n868 restricted the recovery of counsel fees brought pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act, 42 U.S.C. \n[2]\n*868 § 1988,  \"by a prisoner who is confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e\n(d).\nThis appeal presents the question whether the PLRA's limitation of counsel fee awards in prison litigation applies\nto the claim of an attorney whose clients are confined at a secure institution for adjudicated juvenile delinquents.\nWe answer this question in the affirmative. We also reject the plaintiffs' related constitutional claim.\nI.\nBACKGROUND\nThis suit has a long and complex history. In 1985, the plaintiffs, a certified class of juveniles confined in secure\njuvenile institutions in the District of Columbia, alleged that the District and its agents had subjected them to\nunconstitutional and otherwise unlawful conditions of confinement and had failed to provide them with adequate\ncare, rehabilitation and treatment. See District of Columbia v. Jerry M., 571 A.2d 178, 180 (D.C.1990) (Jerry M. I).\nThe parties subsequently reached a settlement, which was memorialized in a consent decree entered on July 24,\n1986. Id. at 179. Since that date, most of the Jerry M. litigation has focused on the District's alleged failure to\n[3]\ncomply with various provisions of the consent decree.\n[4]\nDonna L. Wulkan is one of the attorneys of record for the plaintiffs in Jerry M.  In District of Columbia v. Jerry\nM., 580 A.2d 1270 (D.C.1990) (Jerry M. II), we held that services rendered by Ms. Wulkan were \"fully\ncompensable\" by the District pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, at least to the extent that her fees were reasonable. \nId. at 1272.\n\nIn June 1996, Ms. Wulkan submitted a bill for services furnished on behalf of the plaintiff class from April 15, 1996\nthrough June 7, 1996. The District objected to the amount claimed, arguing that because the PLRA had become\neffective on April 27, 1996, the portion of Ms. Wulkan's fee request which covered the period from that date until\nJune 7, 1996 was subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 803(d). The plaintiffs and Ms. Wulkan opposed\nthe District's motion, contending that the PLRA's amendments to the CRIPA are inapplicable.\nIn an oral decision delivered on August 27, 1996, the trial judge ruled that Section 803(d) does not apply to\njuvenile facilities because, in his view, the plaintiffs were not \"confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional\nfacility\" within the meaning of the Act. On September 11, 1996, the judge ordered the District to pay Ms. Wulkan\n$2,966.40, the full amount requested by her, for services provided after the effective date of the PLRA. This\nappeal followed.\nII.\nLEGAL DISCUSSION\nA. The standard of review.\nAlthough the amount of an award of counsel fees is ordinarily committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, \nsee Jerry M. II, supra, 580 A.2d at 1280, the issue before us is one of statutory construction. Accordingly, we\nreview the trial judge's order de novo. See Alexander S., supra, 113 F.3d at 1381; Ashton Gen. Partnership, Inc.\nv. Federal Data Corp., 682 A.2d 629, 632 (D.C.1996).\nSince the trial judge's ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has squarely decided the\nprincipal question in this case in accordance with the position taken by the District. Alexander S., supra, 113 F.3d\nat 1380-85. The Supreme Court has denied certiorari. ___ U.S. ___, 118 S.Ct. at 880, 139 L.Ed.2d 869. We\n869 accord respectful consideration to the interpretation of the PLRA, which is a federal statute, *869 by the only\n[5]\nfederal appellate court that, to our knowledge, has had occasion to construe the provision here at issue.\nB. Statutory background.\nSection 803 of the PLRA, as codified in the CRIPA, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n(d) Attorney's Fees\n(1) In any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional\nfacility, in which attorney's fees are authorized under section 1988 of this title, such fees shall not\nbe awarded, except to the extent that ...\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e (d)(1) (emphasis added). The statute then enumerates various restrictions on the availability\nof awards of counsel fees to successful plaintiffs, and it establishes a cap of 150 percent of the hourly rate\nprescribed by the Criminal Justice Act. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e (d)(1)-(4).\nThe word \"prisoner\" is defined in Section 803(h) of the PLRA as follows:\nAs used in this section, the term \"prisoner\" means any person incarcerated or detained in any\nfacility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of\ncriminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary\nprogram.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e (h) (emphasis added).\nThe words \"any jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" are not defined in the PLRA.\n\nC. The statutory language.\nThe plaintiffs acknowledged in the trial court, and concede on appeal, that juveniles who have been adjudicated\ndelinquent are \"prisoners\" within the meaning of Sections 803(d) and 803(h). This case therefore turns on\nwhether the plaintiffs are \"confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" as those terms are used in\nSection 803(d).\nIn Alexander S., supra, the court concluded that \"the plain meaning of the [quoted] phrase undoubtedly\n870 encompasses juvenile detention facilities.\" 113 F.3d at 1383. In the court's view, the dictionary definitions[6] of \n[7]\n*870 the statutory terms were broad enough to support that conclusion,  and it was significant that \"Congress\ndid not add any language limiting the scope of these words to adult facilities.\" Id. Noting the expansive meaning\nof the word \"any,\" the court concluded that the phrase at issue must be construed \"to include all jails, prisons, and\ncorrectional facilities, including those housing juveniles.\" Id. (emphasis in original).\nFrom a purely textual perspective, the analysis in Alexander S. is persuasive but perhaps not quite conclusive.\nJuvenile delinquency proceedings are not simply criminal prosecutions featuring very young defendants. As the\nSupreme Court explained in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966),\n[t]he theory of the District's Juvenile Court Act, like that of other jurisdictions, is rooted in social\nwelfare philosophy rather than in the corpus juris. Its proceedings are designated as civil rather\nthan criminal.... The objectives are to provide measures of guidance and rehabilitation for the child\nand protection for society, not to fix criminal responsibility, guilt and punishment.\nId. at 554-55, 86 S.Ct. 1045 (footnote omitted); see also In re L.J., 546 A.2d 429, 437 (D.C.1988). Given the\n[8]\ntheoretically noncriminal character of juvenile delinquency proceedings,  words like \"prison\" and \"jail\" and even\n\"correctional facility,\" which generally refer to crime, punishment, and incarceration, might ordinarily be viewed as\nrelating to something other than juvenile delinquency proceedings, when those proceedings are civil in character\nand based on the Juvenile Court Act's social welfare focus. Section 803(h) of the PLRA, however, explicitly\ndefines \"prisoner\" as including \"adjudicated delinquent.\" See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e (h). If a juvenile delinquent falls\nwithin the definition of a prisoner, then the use in the PLRA of criminal law terminology like \"jail\" or \"prison\" or\n\"correctional facility\" cannot automatically exclude juvenile delinquents from coverage.\nD. The presumption against redundancy.\nAccording to the plaintiffs, however, the language and structure of the CRIPA, which are said to have been\ncarried over into the PLRA, conclusively establish that the plaintiffs are not confined \"to any jail, prison, or other\ncorrectional facility\" and that Ms. Wulkan's claim therefore is not subject to the counsel fee strictures of the PLRA.\nThe plaintiffs rely on the distinction in the CRIPA between \"a jail, prison, or other correctional facility,\" see 42\n871 U.S.C. § 1997(1)(B)(ii), on the one hand, and a facility \"for juveniles,\" id. § 1997(1)(B)(iv), on the other.[9]*871\nThey contend that by listing \"a jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" (subsection ii) separately from \"for\njuveniles\" (subsection iv), Congress must have intended to treat the two categories as different and as mutually\nexclusive. If the phrase \"jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" in subsection (ii) were to be read to include\njuvenile facilities, then, say the plaintiffs, subsection (iv) (facilities for juveniles) would be redundant, and its\npresence in the statute would have no effect. Moreover, the words \"jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" are\nalso used in Section 803(d) of the PLRA and, according to the plaintiffs, the limited meaning of the phrase in the\nCRIPA has therefore been carried over to the PLRA's amendments to the CRIPA.\nIn a related contention, the plaintiffs reiterate that the counsel fee restrictions promulgated in Section 803(d) of\nthe PLRA do not apply to all litigation instituted by prisoners, but only to those actions which have been brought\nby prisoners who are \"confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility.\" (Emphasis added.) If the District's\ninterpretation of the italicized phrase is correct, and if juvenile facilities are included in it, then, say to the plaintiffs,\nthe italicized phrase has no effect, and might just as well have been omitted from the statute.\n\n[10]\nThe plaintiffs' position is not without surface appeal.  \"Where, as here, we are asked to determine the meaning\nof, and discern the interaction between, several statutory provisions, we are especially mindful that each\nprovision of the statute should be construed so as to give effect to all of the statute's provisions, not rendering\nany provision superfluous.\" District of Columbia v. Morrissey, 668 A.2d 792, 798 (D.C.1995) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615\n(1955); Veney v. United States, 681 A.2d 428, 433 (D.C.1996) (en banc); Friendship Hosp. for Animals, Inc. v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 698 A.2d 1003, 1006 (D.C.1997). \"[R]edundancy should not be easily attributed to Congress\nif another interpretation is possible.\" Wirtz v. Cascade Employer's Ass'n, Inc., 219 F.Supp. 84, 86 (D.D.C.1963).\nMoreover, if, as the plaintiffs assert, the phrase \"jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" implicitly excludes\njuvenile facilities, and if that phrase has an established meaning within the context of the CRIPA, then that\nmeaning may constitute a statutory definition that would necessarily trump other definitions, even those with\ncloser ties to the dictionary. \"When a legislature defines the language it uses, its definition is binding upon the\ncourt even though the definition does not coincide with the ordinary meaning of the words.\" 1A NORMAN J.\nSINGER, SUTHERLAND ON STATUTES AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION § 20.08, at 90 (5th ed.1993).\nWe conclude for several reasons, however, that the canon of construction on which the plaintiffs rely, while\nproperly a part of the court's interpretive calculus, is not dispositive of the case. We note at the outset that the\n\"so-called canons of construction are not technical rules of law which afford the answer to a problem like this.\" \nMastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB, 350 U.S. 270, 293, 76 S.Ct. 349, 100 L.Ed. 309 (1956). Canons phrased in\nEnglish, like Latin maxims, \"will only take us so far.\" Edwards v. United States, 583 A.2d 661, 664 (D.C.1990).\nThe presumption against redundancy, like the rule of ejusdem generis addressed in Edwards, \"is only a\nconstructionary crutch and not a judicial ukase in the ascertainment of legislative intention.\" Id. (citation omitted).\n\"Canons of construction provide some guidance, but cannot anticipate all of the variables which converge in a\nconcrete case.\" Id.\n872 The limits of the redundancy canon are illustrated in this case. The plaintiffs argue, *872 as we have noted, that\nas used in the CRIPA, a facility for juveniles00Section 1997(1)(B)(iv)00cannot be a \"jail, prison, or other\n97 97\ncorrectional facility\"00Section 1997(1)(B)(ii)00because, if it were, subsection (iv) would be redundant. This\n97 97\ncontention assumes, however, that each of the five subsections was intended to define a separate type of facility,\nand that no overlap was intended. An analysis of the statute, which we have quoted in relevant part in note 9, \nsupra, reveals that this is an improbable hypothesis. Subsection (iii)00a pretrial detention facility00is likely to\n97 97\noverlap in many if not most instances with subsection (ii)00a jail, prison, or other correctional facility. Subsection\n97\n(i)00a facility for the mentally ill, retarded, etc.00likewise overlaps with subsection (v)00an institution providing skilled\n97 97 97\ncare. A reasonable reading of Section 1997(1)(B) suggests that the drafter's focus was on ensuring that the\nlegislation covered all institutions intended to be included, and not on defining strictly exclusive categories.\nMoreover, even if the term \"jail, prison, or other correctional facility,\" as used in the CRIPA, unambiguously\nexcluded facilities for adjudicated delinquents00and it does not00it is not at all obvious that this restrictive definition\n97 97\nwas adopted in the PLRA. The phrase in question appears not only in Section 803 of the PLRA, but also in\nSections 807 and 808, which amend 18 U.S.C. § 3626. But prior to the enactment of the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626\ndid not contain these words. It is improbable that Congress used the phrase three times in the PLRA, intending to\naccord the words their ordinary dictionary meaning in Sections 807 and 808, but contemplating a limited and\ncompressed meaning in Section 803.\nFinally, the redundancy canon on which the plaintiffs have predicated their argument can be a two-edged sword.\nSection 803(h) defines a \"prisoner\" as a person incarcerated \"in any facility\" who, inter alia, has been convicted\nof a crime or adjudicated delinquent. The District argues that, if the plaintiffs' construction is correct, then the\nwords \"any facility\" never come into play and become superfluous.\n\nE. Congressional intent.\nIn Alexander S., the court expressed the view that the CRIPA \"distinguishes between a `jail, prison, or other\ncorrectional facility'\" and a \"juvenile facility,\" and that the former phrase \"excludes\" the latter. 113 F.3d at 1383.\nThe court continued:\nBecause ... the PLRA's definition of \"prison\" [in Section 802] (which includes juvenile facilities) is\ninconsistent [with] § 1997's implicit definition of \"jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" (which\nexcludes juvenile facilities), we conclude that the phrase is ambiguous.\n[11]\nId. Although we do not altogether subscribe to the court's underlying analysis,  and although we think that the\nDistrict has the better of the textual argument, we agree, especially in light of the canon of construction\ndisfavoring redundancy, that no dispositive \"plain meaning\" conclusively emerges. Further analysis is therefore\nrequired to ascertain the intent of Congress. We begin that inquiry with a visit to some venerable but instructive\ncase law.\nWell before those of us who are today invoking his wisdom were born, one of this nation's most distinguished\njurists wrote that statutes \"should be construed, not as theorems of Euclid, but with some imagination of the\npurposes which lie behind them.\" Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v. Yensavage, 218 F. 547, 553 (2d Cir.1914) (Learned\nHand, J.), cert. denied,235 U.S. 705, 35 S.Ct. 282, 59 L.Ed. 434 (1915). Earlier still, the highest court of this\njurisdiction declared that\nevery statute must be construed with reference to the original intent and meaning of the makers,\nand which intent and meaning may be collected from the cause or necessity of the enactment,\nand the objects intended to be accomplished by it.\n873 Ex parte Redmond, 3 App. D.C. 317, 318 (1894). Having failed to discern a plain *873 meaning in the relevant\nprovisions of the PLRA, we must determine whether it is the plaintiffs' interpretation or the District's that most\neffectively carries out the purposes that Congress sought to achieve by passing the new legislation.\nThe PLRA was enacted in order to \"impos[e] new restrictions on class action and individual prisoner lawsuits,\" to\n\"sharply circumscribe[] a prisoner's ability to seek remedies for alleged unconstitutional prison conditions,\" and\n[12]\nthereby to \"limit federal courts'  involvement in the daily operation of federal and state correctional facilities.\" \nAlexander S., supra, 113 F.3d at 1379. The plaintiffs have acknowledged in their brief in this court that the PLRA\n[13]\nwas \"animat[ed]\" by a general Congressional hostility to prison litigation.  Although that hostility was not\n[14]\nabsolute,  the PLRA was plainly the result of a perception in the Congress that lawyers and judges were\nintruding to an unacceptable degree upon the prerogatives of prison administrators, and that litigation over prison\nconditions should not be encouraged and should be restricted to those situations in which constitutional rights\nwere genuinely in jeopardy. It is our duty, in interpreting the statute, to keep its dominant purpose firmly in mind.\nThe concerns of Congress regarding prison litigation and its perceived intrusion upon the authority of federal and\nstate correctional officials demonstrably extended to suits brought by or on behalf of juveniles as well as to\nactions instituted by adults. We have previously noted that, in Section 803(h) of the PLRA, the term \"prisoner\" is\nexplicitly defined as including an adjudicated juvenile delinquent. The theme implicit in this definition00namely, that\n97\nthe PLRA was designed to make litigation harder for juvenile wrongdoers as well as for their adult\ncounterparts00is echoed in other provisions of the legislation as well.\n97\nPrior to the enactment of the PLRA, the words \"jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" appeared in two places in\nthe CRIPA. First, as we have seen, this phrase was a part of the definition of \"institution.\" See 42 U.S.C. § 1997\n(1) (quoted in note 9, supra). Second, the phrase appeared in 42 U.S.C. § 1997e (a). Prior to its amendment by\nthe PLRA, § 1997e (a) required a plaintiff to exhaust his or her administrative remedies (when appropriate and in\nthe interest of justice) in any action brought \"by an adult convicted of a crime and confined in any jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility.\" (Emphasis added.) The PLRA, however, amended § 1997e (a) by substituting the\nwords \"by a prisoner\" for the words \"by an adult convicted of a crime.\" (Emphasis added.) Because \"prisoner\"\n\nincludes \"adjudicated delinquent,\" the exhaustion requirement previously applicable only to adults had been\nextended so that it would now reach juvenile delinquents as well. In addition, the PLRA introduced the phrase \"by\na prisoner who is confined [in] any jail, prison or other correctional facility\" into five new sections of the CRIPA as\n[15]\namended, including, as we have seen, the counsel fee provisions, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e (d).\nIn Alexander S., the court stated:\n874 In enacting the PLRA, Congress had far-reaching goals, and nothing in the Act *874 indicates an\nintent to omit juveniles confined in juvenile facilities from its impact. To the contrary, by enacting §\n803 of the PLRA, Congress affirmatively amended 42 U.S.C.A. § 1997e to replace the word\n\"adult\" with the word \"prisoner,\" and then defined \"prisoner\" to expressly include juveniles\nadjudicated delinquent of crimes.\n113 F.3d at 1384. We agree with this analysis.\nFinally, it is undisputed that the STOP provisions of Section 802 of the PLRA, which severely limit the substantive\nremedies available to plaintiffs in prison conditions litigation, apply to delinquents in juvenile facilities, for a prison\nis there defined as any facility that \"detains juveniles or adults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or\nadjudicated delinquent for\" violating the criminal law. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(5); Alexander S., supra, 113 F.3d\nat 1384. Concededly, this definition is not expressly carried over into Section 803 of the PLRA. Nevertheless, like\nthe court in Alexander S., \"[w]e can discern no reason for Congress to limit the more important substantive\nremedies available to juveniles under [Section] 802 of the PLRA, yet not [to] limit the availability of attorney's fees\nunder [Section] 803.\" Id. at 1384.\nF. Practical construction.\nWith the foregoing analysis of the statutory purposes in mind, we now consider the practical consequences of the\nplaintiffs' proposed construction.\nThe plaintiffs acknowledge that adjudicated delinquents are prisoners within the meaning of Section 803(d). They\ntherefore also concede, as they must, that if an adjudicated delinquent were confined in a jail or prison00if, in the\n97\nDistrict of Columbia, he were confined at Lorton, rather than at Oak Hill00the PLRA's restrictions on awards of\n97\ncounsel fees would apply. Nevertheless, according to the plaintiffs, Section 803 has no application where, as in\nthis case, adjudicated delinquents are confined in a juvenile facility.\nSuch a construction may perhaps be plausible in the abstract, but in our view it makes little practical sense. We\nnote first that adjudicated delinquents are not ordinarily confined in adult facilities. As stated in Alexander S.:\nThe Juvenile Prosecution Act of 1994 prohibits the placement of juveniles in adult federal facilities.\nSee 18 U.S.C.A. § 5039 (West Supp.1997) (\"No juvenile committed, whether pursuant to an\nadjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense, to the custody of the Attorney General\nmay be placed or retained in an adult jail or correctional institution....\"). Also, a juvenile who is\nsimply \"accused of\" a crime or even \"adjudicated delinquent\" would not, under normal\ncircumstances, be confined to an adult state facility.\n[16]\n113 F.3d at 1385.  We think it most improbable that Congress would have included adjudicated delinquents in\nthe definition of \"prisoner\" in Section 803(d) and in four other provisions of the PLRA, if their inclusion would have\nreached only a small percentage of those delinquents. If the plaintiffs' construction of Section 803 were correct,\nthen the change in the PLRA from \"adult\" to \"prisoner,\" and the definition of \"prisoner\" to include adjudicated\ndelinquents, would have had limited practical consequences.\nMoreover, under the plaintiffs' construction of the Act, an attorney whose juvenile client is confined at Oak Hill is\nentitled to a more generous award of counsel fees than his counterpart whose client is (hypothetically) confined\nat Lorton. The plaintiffs have offered no explanation, in the statute or in its legislative history, for such an unusual\n875 distinction, and their own hypothetical justifications, while imaginative, are unpersuasive.[17]*875 We discern no\n\nrational basis for the notion that the Oak Hill resident's lawyer should be paid more than the attorney for his\n[18]\njuvenile counterpart at Lorton, and we do not believe that Congress intended such a result.\nThe construction of the PLRA urged upon us by the plaintiffs is certainly not compelled by its text. But even if the\nmost natural reading of the statutory language supported the plaintiffs' position, the practical consequences\nwould be decidedly odd. \"Where the literal reading of a statutory term would compel an odd result, we must\nsearch for other evidence of Congressional intent to lend the term its proper scope.\" Public Citizen, supra, 491\nU.S. at 454, 109 S.Ct. 2558 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the District's proposed\nconstruction is far more plausible.\nIII.\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT\nIn the alternative, the plaintiffs assert that Section 803(d) deprives prisoners of liberty without due process of law.\nThey claim that Congress, \"[b]y changing the standards for prison conditions cases only ... deliberately made it\nmore difficult for prisoners to vindicate their constitutional rights by seeking redress from the courts.\" According to\nthe plaintiffs, the PLRA impermissibly interferes with the \"fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts\".\nSee Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 2177, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (citation omitted).\nThe plaintiffs do not claim, nor can they, that their own access to the courts has been infringed. In fact, the\nplaintiff class has been vigorously litigating this case for many years. Moreover, their primary counsel, the Public\n[19]\nDefender Service, has not sought counsel fees from the District.  The plaintiffs are thus compelled to argue, in\neffect, that the PLRA violates the rights of persons other than themselves. Because they are attacking the\nconstitutionality of the statute on its face, they must demonstrate that \"no set of circumstances exists under which\nthe Act would be valid.\" United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987).\nThe plaintiffs begin this obviously uphill battle with the contention that the \"strict scrutiny\" standard applies, in light\nof the \"fundamental\" nature of the right of access to courts. We disagree. The first step in a \"fundamental right\"\nanalysis is to engage in a \"careful description of the asserted right.\" Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S.Ct.\n1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). While the Due Process Clause does guarantee prisoners the opportunity to fairly\npresent to the courts allegations of constitutional violations, see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 579, 94 S.Ct.\n2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 616, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), that right\nis not genuinely at issue here. The Constitution does not require the \"permanent provision of counsel.\" Lewis,\nsupra, 518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. at 2181. In the present case, we see nothing \"fundamental\" about an asserted\nright to recover counsel fees in a desired amount, particularly when fee-shifting in other forms of civil litigation is\nthe exception, not the rule. See Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct.\n876 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); see also Ross, supra, 417 U.S. at 616, 94 S.Ct. 2437 (\"that a particular *876\nservice might be of benefit to an indigent defendant does not mean that the service is constitutionally required\").\nAs a fall-back position, the plaintiffs argue that Section 803's counsel fee restrictions are unconstitutional even\nunder \"rational basis\" analysis. Under this test, there is a \"heavy presumption of constitutionality,\" Department of\nLabor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 721, 110 S.Ct. 1428, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990), and the plaintiffs face the\nformidable burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the legislation transgresses the Constitution. \nSee Hornstein v. Barry, 560 A.2d 530, 533 (D.C.1989) (en banc).\nCongress was apparently motivated by a concern that the expenses of prison litigation were becoming too high. \nSee, e.g., 142 CONG. REC. § 10576 (daily ed. Sept. 16, 1996) (statement of Sen. Abraham) (observing that the\ndefense of prison litigation cost the states approximately $81 million dollars). Congress may also have wished to\ninsure that attorneys for prisoners would not receive excessive fee awards at taxpayer expense. Cf. Farrar v.\nHobby, 506 U.S. 103, 115, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992) (Section 1988 was \"never intended to produce\nwindfalls to attorneys\") (citation omitted). Finally, Congress was obviously apprehensive that litigation of this kind\nwas intruding impermissibly on the prerogatives of prison officials and diverting them from their substantive\nresponsibilities. We cannot say that these objectives lack legitimacy.\n\nWe also conclude that § 1997e (d) is rationally related to legitimate state interests. See City of New Orleans v.\nDukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976). The restrictions directly advance the\npermissible governmental objective of reducing prisoner litigation expenses and curtailing excessive counsel\nfees. According to the District, the provision most troublesome to the plaintiffs, namely, that the fee may not\nexceed 150% of the CJA rate, establishes a fee limit of $112.50 per hour. Nothing in the Constitution of the\n[20]\nUnited States supports the contention that such a fee is unreasonable.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order appealed from is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\nSo ordered.\n[1]See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3626(a)-(f). STOP stands for \"Stop Turning Out Prisoners.\"\n[2] any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [42 U.S.C. § 1983], the court, in its discretion, may allow the\nprevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs....\n42 U.S.C. § 1988(b).\n[3] This court addressed one such dispute in Jerry M. I.\n[4] The plaintiffs are also represented by the Public Defender Service (PDS) and by the National Prison Project of\nthe American Civil Liberties Union.\n[5]See, e.g., Street v. Hedgepath, 607 A.2d 1238, 1243 n. 5 (D.C.1992) (federal cases interpreting a federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure are persuasive authority in this court's construction of identical local Rule); Arthur Young & Co.\nv. Sutherland, 631 A.2d 354, 361 n. 17 (D.C.1993) (this court looks to federal decisions construing federal statute\nfor guidance in construing similar local statute). If we are guided by decisions of the federal appellate courts\nconstruing federal statutes when we interpret similar District of Columbia legislation, then those federal decisions\nare even more persuasive where, as here, our task is to construe the very federal statute which the United States\nCourt of Appeals has construed. \nAlthough the majority rule appears to be that decisions of the federal appellate courts in cases raising federal\nquestions, while persuasive, are not binding authority on state courts, see 21 C.J.S. Courts § 159, at 196-97\n(1990); 20 AM. JUR.2D Courts § 171, at 454-55 & nn. 78-80 (1995), there is significant authority to the contrary. \nSee, e.g., Desmarais v. Joy Mfg. Co., 130 N.H. 299, 538 A.2d 1218, 1220 (1988) (\"we are guided and bound by\nfederal statutes and decisions of the federal courts interpreting those statutes\"); Blue Cross & Blue Shield of\nAlabama v. King, 532 So.2d 1045, 1046 (Ala.Civ.App.1988) (\"absent the existence of a United States Supreme\nCourt ruling on a federal question, the decision of a federal appellate court is binding on our state courts[;] ...\n[h]owever, if federal decisions are in conflict, we may follow and apply the better reasoned decision\") (citation and\ninternal quotations omitted); Flanagan v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., 67 N.Y.2d 500, 504 N.Y.S.2d 82, 495\nN.E.2d 345, 348,cert. denied,479 U.S. 931, 107 S.Ct. 402, 93 L.Ed.2d 355 (1986) (\"we are bound to apply the\n[federal] statute as interpreted by Supreme Court decision or, absent such, in accordance with the rule\nestablished by lower federal courts if they are in agreement\") (citing cases); Darr v. Long, 210 Neb. 57, 313\nN.W.2d 215, 220 (1981) (\"in the administration and interpretation of federal legislative acts, pertinent opinions of\nthe federal courts are binding upon the state courts\") (citation omitted). The District has not asked us to follow\nthese cases or to treat Alexander S. as binding authority, and we consider that decision as persuasive precedent\nonly.\n\n[6] The use of dictionaries in the interpretation of statutes is entirely permissible, see, e.g., Estate of Cowart v.\nNicklos Drilling Co., 505 U.S. 469, 477, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992), but while \"`the words used,\neven in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of\nany writing,' nevertheless `it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a\nfortress out of the dictionary[.]'\" Public Citizen v. United States Dep't of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 454, 109 S.Ct.\n2558, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989) (quoting Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir.) (Learned Hand, J.), aff'd,\n326 U.S. 404, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945)); James Parreco & Son v. District of Columbia Rental Hous.\nComm'n, 567 A.2d 43, 46 (D.C. 1989). Acknowledging the limits of literalism as articulated by Judge Hand, we\nhave nevertheless opined that when we construe statutes, \"it is useful to have [a dictionary] around.\" Riggs Nat'l\nBank v. District of Columbia, 581 A.2d 1229, 1235 (D.C.1990).\n[7] The court stated: \n\"Jail\" is commonly defined as a \"place for the lawful confinement of persons\" or a \"prison.\" Webster's II New\nRiverside University Dictionary 650 (1988). It is also defined as a \"prison\" or a place \"usually used to hold\npersons either convicted of misdemeanors (minor crimes) or persons awaiting trial or as a lock-up for intoxicated\nand disorderly persons.\" Black's Law Dictionary 834 (6th ed.1990). \"Correctional institution\" is a \"generic term\ndescribing prisons, jails, reformatories and other places of correction and detention.\" Id. at 344. And, \"house of\ncorrection\" is defined as a \"prison for the reformation of petty or juvenile offenders.\" Id.\n113 F.3d at 1383.\n[8] \"The Juvenile Court is theoretically engaged in determining the needs of the child and of society rather than\nadjudicating criminal conduct.\" Kent, supra, 383 U.S. at 544, 86 S.Ct. 1045 (emphasis added); L.J., supra, 546\nA.2d at 437.\n[9] The CRIPA provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \n(1) The term \"institution\" means any facility or institution00\n97\n(A) which is owned, operated, or managed by, or provides services on behalf of any State or political subdivision\nof a State; and\n(B) which is00\n97\n(i) for persons who are mentally ill, disabled, or retarded, or chronically ill or handicapped;\n(ii) a jail, prison, or other correctional facility;\n(iii) a pretrial detention facility;\n(iv) for juveniles00\n97\n(I) held awaiting trial;\n(II) residing in such facility or institution for purposes of receiving care or treatment; or\n(III) residing for any State purpose in such facility [with certain exclusions]; or\n(v) providing skilled nursing, intermediate or long-term care, or custodial or residential care.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997(1) (emphasis added).\n[10] We note, however, that if there is an overlap between subsection (ii) and subsection (iv), it is a partial overlap\nonly. Subsection (iv) includes institutions which are not correctional in nature at all, and those institutions are not\nswallowed up by subsection (ii)'s \"jail, prison, or other correctional facility.\"\n\n[11] For the reasons stated in Part II. D, supra, we do not believe that the CRIPA's definition of \"jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility\" necessarily excludes facilities for adjudicated delinquents, and we therefore discern no\nconflict between the CRIPA and the PLRA as to the meaning of the term.\n[12] Although the court in Alexander S. referred to federal courts' involvement, it is undisputed that the PLRA\napplies with equal force to suits instituted in the Superior Court.\n[13] The plaintiffs contend, however, that this hostility does not shed light on the proper construction of individual\nprovisions of the statute.\n[14] While attempting to deter frivolous prisoner litigation, \"Congress preserved the rights of prisoners with valid\nclaims to have access to an attorney and seek legal redress for meritorious claims by including the provision for\nattorney fees.\" Hernandez v. Kalinowski, 146 F.3d 196, 200 (3d Cir.1998).\n[15]See also 42 U.S.C. § 1997e (c) (providing for the immediate dismissal of frivolous lawsuits); § 1997e (e)\n(limiting recovery for emotional injury); § 1997e (f) (restricting removal of prisoner from confinement during\npretrial proceedings); § 1997e (g) (defendant's failure to respond to complaint regarding prison conditions not to\nbe treated as an admission). There are, however, several provisions of the PLRA which expressly apply only to\nadults. See, e.g., PLRA § 809(a), 28 U.S.C. § 1932 (limiting revocation of earned release credit to adults\nconvicted of a crime and confined in a federal correctional facility). By contrast, no such express limitation\nappears in the counsel fee provision.\n[16]But cf. 28 C.F.R. § 31 (1996), promulgated after the PLRA became effective, and authorizing transfer of\nadjudicated delinquent to adult facility where a delinquent has reached the full age of criminal responsibility and\nwhere the transfer is authorized by state law; In re C.B., 708 So.2d 391, 399 (La.1998); Bureau of Justice\nStatistics, Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 1997 (1998).\n[17] According to the plaintiffs, Congress might have concluded that juveniles in adult facilities can adequately\nprotect their own rights through pro se litigation. In contrast, juveniles in juvenile facilities are alleged to be less\nable to do so, and the plaintiffs say that Congress may have refrained from imposing any counsel fee restrictions\nthat would create a disincentive for attorneys to undertake to represent such juveniles. But no infant, wherever he\nor she may be confined, has the capacity to sue without a representative, Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(c), and the plaintiffs\nhave not identified any jurisdiction which has a different rule. \nThe plaintiffs also assert that the different treatment of juveniles confined to juvenile facilities makes sense at\nleast within the context of Section 803(a), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e (a), because a rule which requires all inmates of\nadult facilities to exhaust their administrative remedies may be more efficient than one which applies only to the\nadult inmates of an adult facility. This \"efficiency\" explanation does not, however, provide a rationale for Section\n803(d)'s restriction on counsel fees.\n[18] Indeed, the Supreme Court of Louisiana has held that where a juvenile is transferred to an adult facility, he\nacquires protections greater than those that he had when he was confined in a juvenile facility (e.g., the right to a\njury trial). See In re C.B., supra note 16, 708 So.2d at 399-400.\n[19] Nor is the PDS permitted to do so. See D.C.Code § 1-2702(a)(2) (1992).\n[20] Because we do not entertain \"grave doubts\" as to the constitutionality of Section 803(d), our construction of\nthe statute is unaffected by constitutional considerations.

The class\nincludes (but is not limited to) children who are or will be\nconfined at Cedar Knoll Youth Center and those who are or will\nbe confined at Oak Hill Youth Center.  These children are\nconfined under court orders of detention (pending trial or\npending disposition) pursuant to D.C. Code § 16-2313(b)(3), or\nunder dispositional orders of commitment to the Department of\nHuman Services pursuant to D.C. Code § 16-2320(c)(2).\nCedar Knoll Youth Center is a detention facility for\nchildren, operated by the District of Columbia, and located in\nLaurel, Maryland.  The resident population of Cedar Knoll\nfluctuates from approximately 70 to 100 youths.  Approximately\ntwo-fifths of the children incarcerated at Cedar Knoll are\ndetained pending trial or disposition; the rest are committed to\nthe Department of Human Services.  Cedar Knoll is an antiquated\n\"reform school\" whose buildings have become unfit for habita-\ntion and whose programs are grossly limited and wholly\ninadequate.  The children live in buildings that are insuffi-\nciently heated and ventilated, are infested with vermin, and\nhave gaping holes in walls and ceilings.  Without meaningful\nrehabilitative services, the residents are warehoused for months\nor years before being returned to the community.\nThe Oak Hill Youth Center is a maximum-security juvenile\ndetention facility operated by the District of Columbia, and\nalso located in Laurel, Maryland.  The population of Oak Hill\nis approximately 150 children.  Approximately one-third are\ndetained pending trial or disposition, and the other two-thirds\nare committed to the Department of Human Services.  The\nbuildings at Oak Hill are newer than those at Cedar Knoll and so\nOak Hill may appear on the surface to be a better facility. But,\n- 5 -\n\nscrutiny  1 the rehabilitative servi  s at Oak Hill —  the heart\nof any facility for caring for detained youth and treating\ndelinquent youth —  reveals that the services at Oak Hill are as\ndeplorably inadequate as those at Cedar Knoll.\nAll of the named plaintiffs in this action are currently\nconfined in these detention facilities.  The named plaintiffs\ninclude children who are detained at Cedar Knoll, children\ncommitted to Cedar Knoll, children detained at Oak Hill, and\nchildren committed to Oak Hill.\nThe plaintiffs contend that the totality of the conditions\nin these juvenile detention facilities violates statutory and\nconstitutional requirements.  The plaintiffs live under condi-\ntions that are inhumane and that inflict needless suffering.\nThey are deprived of the educational, vocational, mental health,\nand other social services that they so desperately need and that\ndefendants are obligated to provide.  The totality of these con-\nditions violates the children's statutory right to appropriate\ncare and treatment under D.C. Code §§ 16-2313(b) and 2320 (as\ninterpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2), their statutory rights to\nadequate educational services under D.C. Code §§ 31-401 and\n31-403 and under 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401 et seq., and their rights\nunder the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the united States\nConstitution.\n- 6 -\n\n1.  This is a civil action for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code\nSS 11-921(a)(2) and 11-921(a)(3)(C).\n2.  This action seeks to redress injuries, suffered by\nplaintiffs and the class they represent, for deprivation of\nrights secured by the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the\nConstitution of the United States, and the Education of the\nHandicapped Act (20 U.S.C. S 1401 et seq.)  These claims for\nrelief are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983.\n3.  This action furthermore seeks relief for defendants'\ndepriving plaintiffs and the class they represent of their\nrights, under the laws of the District of Columbia, to appro-\npriate care and treatment  (D.C. Code SS 16-2313(b), 16-2320;\nSCR-Juv. Rule 2) and educational services (D.C. Code §§ 31-401,\n31-403).\nPARTIES\nPlaintiffs\n4.  Each of the plaintiffs is presently incarcerated in a\njuvenile detention facility operated by the District of\nColumbia.  Plaintiff Jerry M. is detained, pending trial, at\nCedar Knoll Youth Center, and plaintiff David U. is detained,\npending disposition, at Cedar Knoll.  Plaintiff Anthony W. has\nbeen committed to the Department of Human Services, and was\nplaced by the Department at Cedar Knoll.  Plaintiff Omar H. is\ndetained, pending trial, at Oak Hill Youth Center.  Plaintiffs\n¦ Maurice B., Willie H., Gerald R., and Rondy S. have been\n¦ committed to the Department of Human Services, and placed by the\nDepartment at Oak Hill.\n- 7 -\n\n5.  ^'aintiff Jerry M. is a sixr ¾u o. ~~_ _,\n J¢\neducational handicaps.  He has been diagnosed as functioning \"in\nthe low end of the borderline retarded range\" and as needing a\n\"full-time special education placement for emotionally disturbed\nadolescents.\"  Prior to his incarceration at Cedar Knoll, Jerry\nattended a special education school in the community.  But\nduring his detention at Cedar Knoll, he has been placed in\nregular education classes with the general population.  Most of\nthe school curriculum is above his level, and he finds that the\nteachers invariably move through the material too quickly for\nhim to comprehend.\n6.  Plaintiff David U. is a sixteen year old youth with\nsubstantial emotional problems.  He has been diagnosed as\nseverely depressed, passive-dependent, and possibly suffering\nfrom brain disfunction.  Mental health professionals have\ndetermined that David needs a structured program of education\nand vocational training, and requires individual counseling.\nYet, during the three months that David has been detained at\nCedar Knoll, pending trial and now pending disposition, he has\nnot received any educational, vocational, or psychological\nservices at all.\n7.  Plaintiff Anthony W. is a thirteen year old boy with\nemotional problems and educational handicaps.  A psychological\nevaluation found that Anthony's \"functioning fluctuates from\nmentally deficient to low average,\" and the D.C. Public Schools\ndetermined that Anthony should be placed in a special education\nschool program.  But Cedar Knoll has consistently refused to\nprovide Anthony with appropriate special educational services\nand has failed to adequately assess his educational needs.\n8.  Plaintiff Omar H. is a seventeen year old youth who\nfunctions in the mildly mentally retarded range and has\ncognitive deficits in visual-motor performance.  While in the\ncommunity, Omar attended a special education school.  But while\nat Oak Hill —  during a previous period of commitment and during\nhis present period of pre-trial detention —  Omar is deprived of\nappropriate special education services and attends class with\nthe general population.\n- 8 -\n\n9.  Plaintllt  naun>,c  u·,  - _\ncommitted to Oak Hill.  Maurice has a history of severe abuse of\nPCP, and a psychiatrist has called for drug counseling for\nMaurice.  Oak Hill, however, does not provide any such\ncounseling for its residents.  Maurice is also one of several\nyoung men who have been physically assaulted by a counselor\nwhile at Oak Hill.\n10.  Plaintiff Willie H. is a seventeen year old with\nsubstantial educational handicaps, who has been assessed as\nneeding special education.  Oak Hill has consistently failed to\nprovide Willie with the special educational services that he\nneeds.\n11.  Seventeen year old plaintiff Gerald R·, who is commit-\nted to Oak Hill, also has major educational handicaps: he\nsuffers from a learning disability, developmental language\ndisorder, and has an immediately noticeable speech impediment.\nYet, Oak Hill has placed him in regular classes with the general\npopulation, and has failed to provide him with speech therapy\nservices.  Although mental health professionals have deter-\nmined that Gerald is in need of \"individual as well as group\ncounseling on a daily basis,\" he receives no psychological\ntherapy whatsoever at Oak Hill.\n12.  Plaintiff Rondy S. is an educationally gifted eighteen\nyear old who has earned his G.E.D. degree and intends to pursue\nhigher education.  Because Oak Hill will not provide —  or\narrange —  college level classes for gifted children like Rondy,\nhe spends his days working on facility maintenance and sitting\nin the cottage watching television.  Rondy was the subject of a\nvicious assault by another resident, at a time when the\nresidents were inadequately supervised by the counselors.\n13.  Plaintiffs bring this action by and through their next\nfriend, Donna Wulkan, Clinical Instructor in the Antioch School\nof Law Juvenile Rights Clinic and Developmental Disabilities Law\nClinic.  Ms. Wulkan is qualified to serve as next friend for the\nnamed plaintiffs and the class which they represent, and will\nfully and actively advocate the interests of both the named\n- 9 -\n\nplaintiff ` ana _ue c¿et&a.  *.\n(D. D.C. 1984), the Honorable Harold Greene appointed Ms. Wulkan\nas guardian ad litem for the class of all former, current and\nfuture residents of St. Elizabeths Hospital Division of Child\nand Adolescent Services.  In that capacity, Ms. Wulkan parti-\ncipated in negotiations with the District of Columbia and\nentered into a settlement on behalf of the entire class of\nchildren.\nClass Action Allegations\n14.  This is a class action under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(l)\nand (2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.\nPlaintiffs are representative of the class which is composed of\nall persons presently confined in District of Columbia juvenile\ndetention facilities or who may be so confined in the future.\n15.  Plaintiffs are members of the class and their claims\nare typical of all class members.\n16.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.  There are approximately 200-250 children\ncurrently confined in the juvenile detention facilities.  In\naddition, there is an indeterminate number of children who may\nbe confined in these facilities in the future.\n17.  The questions of law and fact presented by the plain-\ntiffs are common to the class.  Plaintiffs live under common\nconditions of confinement, have common grievances and seek\ncommon relief.  The basic legal issues presented by this action\n—  the defendants1 violation of statutory and constitutional\nrequirements for appropriate care and treatment of incarcerated\nchildren —  are common to the class as a whole.\n18.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.  The relief sought in this case, the\nimprovement of living conditions and programs in District of\nColumbia juvenile detention facilities, will benefit all members\nof the class.  Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel\nwho will adequately protect the interests of the class.\n- 10 -\n\n19.  •*¯¯ e defendants nave ~w-  _.\n¦ generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\ninjunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a\nwhole.  Since the named plaintiffs seek to reform living\nconditions and programs in the juvenile detention facilities,\nadjudication with respect to some children confined in these\nfacilities would be dispositive of the interests of other\nchildren not parties to the action.  Prosecution of separate\nactions by individual children would create a risk of\ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual\nmembers of the class, which would subject the population of the\n¡ detention facilities to varying conditions or standards of\nconfinement.\nDefendants\n20.

Physical Structure\n29.  The vast majority of residential units at Cedar Knoll\nYouth Center —  including both buildings housing detained youth\nand buildings housing committed children —  are in a state of\ndisrepair.  The living conditions in these buildings are\ninadequate, inhumane, and hazardous to the residents' health and\nsafety.\n30.  The vast majority of residential units have\nsubstantial holes in the walls and most buildings have major\nholes in the ceilings. Plaster has fallen in large pieces, and\nin some buildings, the outer brick layer is completely exposed.\nThis is true even in units such as Carver, Jefferson, and\nBunche, which were renovated in recent years but have not been\nproperly maintained.  Conditions are particularly deplorable in\nWilson Cottage, a dimly lit, decaying building whose interior\nwalls lack large segments of bricks.\n31.  These residential units provide inadequate shelter from\nthe cold during the winter months.  Most of the buildings have\nwindows that either have broken glass (which is not repaired for\nlengthy periods of time) or cannot be closed because of faulty\nclosing mechanisms.  Even the windows that are fully intact\nprovide inadequate shelter, because they lack any form of\ninsulation and the cold air pierces the window casings.\n32.  The fixtures and furnishings of the buildings are\ntotally deteriorated.  The walls have large strips of peeling\npaint.  There are sofas with the stuffings either totally re-\nmoved or dangling from the sofa onto the floor, and with the\nsprings exposed.  There are beds with the metal slats so bent\nthat the bed cannot be used comfortably.  Wall sockets are\n- 13 -\n\ntotally «  >osed and give electric sh  •ks when used.  Many of the\nelectrical appliances used in the residences, such as television\nsets and floor buffers, have stripped cords which also cause\nelectric shocks to residents.\n33.  The utility services of the facility are inadequately\noperated and maintained.  The heating and plumbing services are\nso old and deteriorated, that they regularly overflow, flooding\nareas and periodically necessitating the temporary closure of\ncottages.  The conditions in several of the cottages violate\nfire safety requirements.\n34.  The vast majority of the cottages are infested with\nvermin.\n35.  Plaintiff Jerry M. lives in Marshall Cottage.  His bed\nis directly adjacent to non-insulated windows that will not\nfully close, and opposite a broken window that has not been\nrepaired for weeks.  His building suffers from broken walls,\npeeling paint, ramshackle furniture, and vermin.\nB.  Educational Services\n¦  i.  Introduction\nI\n,  36.  The Department of Human Services has assumed the\nDistrict of Columbia's responsibility for providing  educational\nii\n'.' services to children who are detained or committed  in the\nDistrict's detention facilities.  The Department of Human\n¦¦ Services operates a school at Cedar Knoll and a school at Oak\nHill.\n37.  The educational services at these facilities consist of\nessentially two types of services: (a) Academic courses\n; paralleling the traditional school curriculum and provided to\nthe general population of the facility  [hereafter referred to as\n\"general educational services\"]; and  (b) \"Special educational\n- 14 -\n\n; services\" \"or residents who are educ¯*¯.ionally  handicapped\n';¡ as a result of learning disabilities, mental  retardation,\nj¦\nj¦ emotional disturbance, or other developmental or organic\n:¡ disorders.\nI  38. The vast majority of the children in the District's\n!\nj detention facilities are educationally  handicapped and in need\ni of special educational services.  In addition, even among the\ní\nremaining general population, there are large numbers of\nstudents who require special attention (because of behavior and\nadjustment problems in the school setting) and remedial tutoring\n(to overcome gaps in their formal education caused by sporadic\nschool attendance in prior years).\nii.  General Educational Services\n¦  39.  The Cedar Knoll School is grossly inadequate.  The\nschool lacks sufficient teachers, educational aides, and support\nservices, and employs teaohers who are not adequately qualified\n,, and who are not certified under the criteria of Ð.C. Public\nI*\n¦ Schools.  The facility places children of widely ranging\n1 abilities and needs into a single class.  Under these impossible\nteaching conditions, the teachers have abandoned even the\nsemblance of attending to all the students in their classes.\nThe teachers generally direct their attention to only a handful\nof students, while allowing the remaining students to play cards\n; or other games in class.  There are frequent absences by\nteachers, and the lack of any substitute teachers results in\ncancellations of classes during these teacher absences.\nI\nPlaintiff Jerry M. attends the Cedar Knoll School, and receives\nan inadequate education as a result of these deficiencies in the\nservices.\nii\n'  40.  The defendants fail to provide any educational services\ni,\nwhatsoever to the residents of Bunche Cottage, the auxiliary\nmaximum security cottage.  These children are not allowed to\nleave their cottage to attend school, and defendants do not send\n. a teacher into the cottage to teach the children.  Plaintiff\n!Í\n\n'I\n! months, aud received no educational . ¿rvices during that period\nof time.\niii.  Special Educational Services\n41.  Under the federal Education of the Handicapped Act, all\neducationally handicapped children are entitled to special\neducation and related services.  (The law explicitly extends the\nbenefits of special educational services to children in\ncorrectional institutions.)  The law requires the District to\nidentify, evaluate, and provide special educational services to\nthose children in its correctional facilities who are\neducationally handicapped.  Yet, with respect to the population\nof children who are confined at Cedar Knoll, the District fails\non all three of these requirements of identification,\nevaluation, and provision of services.\n42.  The District fails to identify the handicapping con-\nditions of the majority of educationally handicapped children\nconfined at Cedar Knoll, because the defendants do not properly\ntest or evaluate these children, do not obtain their educational\nrecords from the schools that the children attended prior to\ntheir incarceration, and do not employ persons trained and\nqualified to identify children with specific learning and\neducational handicaps.\n43.  The District fails to properly evaluate educationally\nhandicapped children at Cedar Knoll, in that the defendants rely\nheavily on tests that are administered by people who have not\nbeen properly trained to administer them, and their evalua-\ntions are made by persons who often lack specialized knowledge\nof the specific area of disability of the children.\n44.  The District violates its statutory duty to provide\nadequate and appropriate special educational services to all\neducationally handicapped children at Cedar Knoll, in all the\nfollowing respects:\na.  Children who are truly educationally\nhandicapped, but have never been\nidentified as such by Cedar Knoll\n- 16 -\n\nare placed in regular  assrooms with\nthe general population, and thereby\nforeclosed from special educational\nservices;\nb.  Even when the defendants do identify\na Cedar Knoll resident as educationally\nhandicapped, the deficiencies in the\nevaluation process result in an Indivi-\ndualized Education Plan that is not\nappropriate for the child's specific\ndisabilities and needs;\nc.  Even when the defendants do prepare or\nobtain a proper Individualized Education\nPlan, the services actually provided to\nthe child do not fulfill the specifica-\ntions of the Plan and do not adequately\nserve the child's special educational\ni  needs.  The Cedar Knoll teachers, who\n¡  are assigned the responsibility for\n¦i  providing  special education, are un-\n¦i\ntrained in the specific learning dis-\nabilities from which the children  suffer,\nand are not provided the time, resources,\nand equipment necessary to provide an\nappropriate education to these children.\n45.  Furthermore, in the course of evaluating and placing\nchildren, the defendants fail to afford Cedar Knoll  residents\nand their parents the procedural rights which are guaranteed by\nfederal law.  Upon admitting children who were in special\neducation classes in the community, the facility  routinely\n,' changes the child's educational setting to a general  educational\n: class without notifying the child's parents of the change in\n¦i\neducational placement and their right to contest the change.\n- 17 -\n\nWhen the fa  lity itself identifies a > lid as handicapped and\norders a preplacement evaluation to determine specific\neducational needs, the defendants do not notify the child's\nparents of the identification of a handicap or secure their\nwritten consent for a preplacement evaluation.  The defendants\nalso frequently fail to notify parents of the results of\nevaluations, their right to a hearing to contest the evalua-\ntion, their right to obtain an independent educational evalua-\ntion at public expense, and the nature of the tests, records,\nand reports relied upon to make the evaluation.  Finally, in\nscheduling meetings for the purpose of preparing Individualized\nEducation Plans, the defendants do not consistently observe\nstatutory requirements for proper and timely notice to the\nchildren's parents.\n46.  Plaintiff Jerry M., who is currently detained at Cedar\nKnoll, has been placed by the facility in a regular education\nclass with the general population.  When he was educationally\nevaluated by Cedar Knoll staff, the staff did not identify any\nspecific handicapping conditions or need for special educational\nservices.  The Cedar Knoll educational assessment recommended\nnothing more than \"tt]utoring in mathematics.\"  Yet, prior to\nhis incarceration, Jerry was evaluated by the Superior Court\nChild Guidance Clinic and D.C. Public Schools as \"functioning\n...  in the low end of the borderline retarded range\" and as\nrequiring \"[a] full-time special education placement for\nemotionally disturbed adolescents.\"  Consistent with his\nevaluation, Jerry had been placed by D.C. Public Schools in a\nfull-time special education school and provided with an\nIndividualized Education Plan.  When Cedar Knoll transferred him\nto a regular educational setting and refused to implement his\nIndividualized Education Plan, defendants violated the\nsubstantive and procedural requirements specified in the federal\nstatute.\n47.  Plaintiff Anthony W. is a thirteen year old boy with\nsubstantial educational handicaps.  A Child Guidance Clinic\nevaluation found that Anthony's \"functioning fluctuates from\n- 18 -\n\nrth  ally def  lent to low average,\" and  at he \"functions at\nonly the third grade level.\"  The D.C. Public Schools determined\nthat Anthony is educationally handicapped, and prepared an\n¦¦ Individualizeã Education Plan for provision of appropriate\nspecial educational services to Anthony.  But when Anthony was\ncommitted to Cedar Knoll, the institution's educational assessor\nfailed to obtain his prior school records and erroneously\nconcluded that \"[t]he need for an IEP is not apparent, at this\ntime.\"  As a result, Anthony has been deprived of the special\neducational services that he needs.  In changing Anthony's\nspecial educational status and declining to enforce the\npreviously prepared Individualized Education Plan, defendants\nfailed to comply with the substantive and procedural criteria\nof the federal statute.\n|\nij\n¦i  C.  Vocational Training Services\n  48. Defendants fail to provide any vocational training\n;\n¦ program whatsoever at Cedar Knoll.  The facility offers neither\nshop programs nor pre-vocational counseling.  Although the\nfacility at one time had a series of shop programs, these have\nall been eliminated.  The only remaining shop, a printing shop,\nhas only one student in it, and is in the process of being dis-\nmantled for transfer to Oak Hill Youth Center.\n49.  Plaintiff Jerry M. suffers from the lack of any\nvocational services at Cedar Knoll.  A psychological evalua-\ntion of Jerry, prepared prior to his incarceration, recommended\n; that he \"receive pre-vocational counseling to prepare him for a\nfuture career\" and that he receive \"[v]ocational training\nthrough high school.\"  Upon Jerry's incarceration, a Cedar Knoll\npsychologist recommended that \"[d]ue to the resident's age,\nJerry would profit from a vocational assessment in order to\ndetermine his vocational interests and ability areas.\"  This\nvocational assessment apparently was never arranged.  Even if\nit had been, however, it would have been an exercise in futility\n- 19 -\n\n¡¦ si*ice there r*-ill would not have been any vocational services at\nCedar Knoll for Jerry.\nD.  Mental Health Services\n50.  The mental health services offered at Cedar Knoll are\ninadequate to meet the needs of a resident population that has a\ndisproportionately large number of children with mental problems\nand emotional disturbances.\n51.  The psychiatric services are virtually non-existent.\nCedar Knoll receives the part-time services of psychiatrist\nAndres Aceituno, whom it shares with Oak Hill and Forest Haven\nfacility for mentally retarded persons.  Dr. Aceituno's services\nI to Cedar Knoll are limited to seeing residents in emergency\nsituations (such as suicide attempts), and he does not provide\npsychiatric therapy on a regular basis to residents.  Even when\ni¡\n¡¦ Dr. Aceituno does see a student, his limited  facility with  the\n¦. English  language  impairs communications  with the  child.\n||  52.  Although Cedar Knoll does have the regular  services  of\npsychologists J. Leonard  Scheinker  and Darwin Raymore,  these\n[  psychologists  are obligated  to divide their time  between\ndiagnostic  testing  of newly committed  residents and therapy. As\na result, the psychological  services which they offer  are\nimpaired  in all the following  respects:\n¦  a.  The testing  is often  insufficiently\n:  comprehensive  to detect and  identify\n•,  the precise mental health needs  of\nthe residents;\nb.  The inadequate time for therapy  forces\nthe psychologists  to adopt a  \"triage\"\npolicy of providing  therapy only  to\nthe most needy and as a result, many\nresidents' mental health needs  go\nunattended;\nli  - 20 -\n¡!\n!l\n\nc.  '''he facility follows a policy or denying\ntherapy services to the enure detained\npopulation, with the exception of those\nchildren who have been court-ordered to\nreceive therapy while detained;\nd.  Even when the psychology department does\nprovide therapy to residents, it is almost\nexclusively group therapy, and residents1\nneeds for individual therapy are frequently\nunmet.\n53.  Plaintiff David U. has significant mental problems. A\n¦ psychiatrist with the Metropolitan Psychiatric Group found that\nDavid suffers from \"significant depression,\" and may also be\n¡ suffering from \"minimal brain disfunction with perceptional\nproblems . . . that might be even partially ameliorated by low\ndose antidepressant.\"  A private psychologist recommended that\nDavid receive \"[e]nrollment in individual counseling.\"  Yet,\nduring a previous period of commitment to Cedar Knoll and during\n; his present period of detention at Cedar Knoll, David has not\ni;\nreceived either psychiatric or psychological therapy services.\níl\nDuring his previous period of commitment, the Cedar Knoll\npsychologist concluded that: \"David is not a priority candidate\nfor mental health services.  However, when resources permit, he\nwill be considered for a counseling group.  ...\"\nE.  Medical Services\n54.  The defendants have failed to secure sufficient\npersonnel and facilities at Cedar Knoll to provide adequate\nmedical care to the residents.  There is not a physician or even\na registered nurse on duty twenty-four hours a day.  The\ncounselors and other direct care staff are not adequately  I\ntrained in first-aid or in how to deal with medical emergencies, i\n- 21 -\n\ni¡\n¡; Moreover, wlv  medical emergencies do o<  \\r, there are not\njl\ni!¡¦ adequate facilities and staff for quickly transporting residents\n¡ to medical care.\n55.  Plaintiff Rondy S. was assaulted and seriously injured\nby another resident in December of 1984.  He sustained major\nlacerations to the back of his head.  There was a delay of\nalmost an hour before counselors were able to arrange transpor-\ntation for the forty minute trip to D.C. General Hospital.\nF.  Counseling Services, Social Services,\nand Direct Care  ¯\n56.  In every cottage of Cedar Knoll, the juvenile residents\nof the cottage are supervised by adult counselors.  These\ncounselors have the primary responsibility for direct care and\nsupervision of the residents.  The facility then provides\n\"social service representatives,\" who have the responsibility\nfor providing social services to groups of residents that have\nbeen assigned to them.\n57.  The majority of the \"social service representatives\" do\nnot have the requisite training or certification to provide\nsocial work services.  As a result, these workers do not do an\nadequate job of assessing the residents' needs, counseling the\nresidents, and arranging for appropriate services.  The \"social\nservice representatives\" are not properly supervised and do not\nreceive a consistent program of in-service training.\n58.  Although a large proportion of the population of Cedar\nKnoll suffers from drug abuse and drug dependency problems, the\nfacility does not provide a drug counseling program for its\nresidents.\n59.  Cedar Knoll does not have a sufficient number of\ncounselors to provide direct care and supervision to all of its\n¡j\n;  residents.  The facility attempts to redress this deficiency by\ni;\n1  permitting counselors to work overtime for higher pay.  As a\n- 22 -\n\ni! res-it, a lar  proportion of the Cedar f^oll staff works long\novertime hours, often working as many as sixty or eighty hours a\nweek.  The effect upon the counselors' performance is profound:\n¦ counselors fail to provide adequate supervision and care for the\n¦ residents, and display irritability and short tempers in dealing\ni\nwith the residents.\n60.  Defendants fail to arrange adequate supervision of\ncounselors' work, and fail to provide adequate and consistent\ntraining of counselors.\nG.  Climate of Violence\n61.  As a result of the following actions, omissions, and\n1 policies, the defendants have created a \"climate of violence\" at\ni¡\n, Cedar Knoll that pervades the daily lives of the residents:\na.  The inadequate training and supervision\nof the counselors has resulted in a\nsituation in which counselors periodically\ncommit physical assaults upon the youthful\nresidents; and\nb.  The staff's inadequate supervision of\nresidents (due to the insufficiency of\nstaff and the inadequate training of\nstaff) has resulted in a situation in\nwhich residents are able to physically\nassault other residents.\nThese conditions not only result in physical harm to the\nresidents who have been assaulted (by counselors or other\nresidents), but also result in psychological harm to the\nremaining residents who witness these assaults and live in\nconstant fear of being injured.\n- 23 -\n\n62.  In ' `¯.ober of 1984, plaintiff <T`rry M. witnessed a\ncounselor's physical assault on DeAnthony C, a seventeen year\nold resident.  DeAnthony had spoken to the counselor in a manner\nthat was insulting (but not threatening).  The counselor grabbed\nDeAnthony by the throat and threw him against a wall.  The\ncounselor thereafter dragged DeAnthony across the floor of the\nroom.  DeAnthony sustained visible bruises to his neck and body\nas a result of this attack.\n63.  In December of 1984, plaintiff Rondy S., who was then\nresiding at Cedar Knoll, was physically assaulted and seriously\ninjured by another resident.  During a period in which the\nresidents were inadequately supervised by a counselor, a\nresident attacked Rondy with a wooden pole.  The pole-wielding\nresident was able to inflict severe injuries on Rondy before a\ncounselor learned that an assault was occurring and intervened.\nBecause there was only one counselor on duty, he required the\nassistance of other residents in order to end the fight and\nimmobilize the attacker.  Thereafter, the counselor had to rely\non residents to contact security and back-up counselors while he\ncontinued to restrain the attacker.\nH.  Recreational Services  ¡\nl\n64.  The recreational program at Cedar Knoll consists of\nperiodic basketball games and non-physical activities such as\ntelevision, movies and card games.  The Cedar Knoll staff do not\nensure that all the residents have an adequate amount of daily\n. major muscle activities.\n65.  The defendants have failed to establish an adequate,\n• structured physical education program at Cedar Knoll.\nI\nDefendants furthermore have failed to establish a program to\nteach leisure time recreational activities such as music and\ncrafts.\n• I\n- 24 -\n\nj  66.  Pla„ .tiff Jerry M. spends most  ; his free time playing\nI cards or watching television.  The only major physical activity\n11\n: in which he engages is an occasional game of basketball in the\nit\n|' institution's gymnasium.\nI.  Procedures for Attorney-Client Communications\n67.  In both their visitation policies and telephone\npolicies, defendants improperly interfere with attorneys' access\nto their clients.\n68.  If an attorney wishes to meet with a detained client,\n1 defendants will transport the child to the Receiving Home.  But\nt\ndefendants have failed to establish sufficient interview rooms\n¦ at the Receiving Home.  As a result, attorneys frequently are\nunable to meet with their clients because all of the rooms are\n!' already filled by other attorneys, probation officers, or mental\n! i\n¦ health professionals.\n:  69.  Defendants have, moreover, adopted a policy of pre-\ni1 eluding transportation of committed residents to. the Receiving\n!i\n. Home for the purpose of attorney-client meetings.  As a result,\n¦ an attorney representing a child in a post-commitment proceeding\nmust travel to Laurel, Maryland to meet with his client.\n70.  The defendants have adopted a policy of closing Cedar\nKnoll's telephone switchboard in the evenings, and thereby pre-\ncluding any calls to residents during the evening hours.  The\n¡.\ndefendants have in this manner severely impaired attorney-client\nii\ncommunications since attorneys who are in court all day often\nmust use the evening hours to call clients.\nJ·  Procedures for Family Visitation\n71.  For the children at Cedar Knoll, like all children, the\nemotional bonds to their parents are a crucial stabilizing and\nshaping influence on the child's development.  Because children\n- 25 -\n\nconfined at cedar Knoll are physically separated from their\nparents, many for the first time in their lives, it is vital\nthat the children be permitted frequent contact with their\nparents.\n72.  The defendants have adopted policies that have the\neffect of limiting committed children's family visits to one day\na month.  Defendants technically permit visits every weekend.\nHowever, most of the children's parents are impoverished and do\nnot own automobiles that they can drive to Laurel, Maryland.\nThe defendants do operate a bus that will transport detained\nchildren's parents from the Receiving Home to Cedar Knoll for\nvisits with their children, but defendants limit the use of this\nbus by- committed children's parents to one day a month.\nII. Oak Hill Youth Center\nA.  Physical Structure\n73.  Although the physical structure of Oak Hill is not as\ndecrepit as Cedar Knoll's, Oak Hill suffers from several\nstructural flaws and defects.  In many of the cottages, there\nare holes in ceilings and walls, broken windows, and broken\nlights.  Appliances such as refrigerators, telephones and air\nvents, constantly malfunction.  Several of the cottages are\ninfested with vermin.\n74.  Many of the cottages fail to comply with fire safety\nrequirements. There are fire extinguishers which are empty and\nneed to be re-charged.  The keys to fire boxes and extinguishers\nfrequently are not kept on the unit, and therefore these\nprotective devices are inaccessible in an emergency.\n75.  The cottages at Oak Hill are not designed to protect\nresidents from extreme weather conditions.  In the winter\nmonths, the lack of adequate insulation allows the cold air to\npierce the walls and window frames.  During the intense heat of\n- 26 -\n\nthe summer n. ,ths, the lack of air cond  ioning in the cottages\nrenders the children's rooms almost unbearable.\n76.  Plaintiff Gerald R. lives in a cottage that is always\ncold during the winter.  He has tried putting cardboard in the\nwindow of his room as insulation, but this is not sufficient to\nkeep out the cold air.\nB.  Educational Services\n77.  The Department of Human Services has assumed the\nDistrict's obligation for providing educational services to\nchildren who are detained at or committed to Oak Hill.  As at\nCedar Knoll, the vast majority of the Oak Hill residents are\neducationally handicapped and in need of special educational\n¦ services.  In addition, even the remaining students, who are\ncapable of attending general educational classes, often require\nspecial attention (because of behavior and adjustment problems\n| in the school setting) and remedial tutoring.\ni.  General Educational Services\n78.  The defendants have organized Oak Hill School in a\nmanner that totally frustrates any hope of providing a\nmeaningful education to the residents.  Rather than placing\nstudents in classes according to their educational abilities,\nthe defendants have organized classes by cottage grouping: a\ncottage of 20 residents will attend class together.  But\nresidents' cottage placements are randomly selected, and the\neducational abilities within each cottage vary widely.  Thus, a\nsingle teacher will be confronted with a cottage group whose\nabilities range from third-grade to college level.  Given these\nteaching conditions and the lack of sufficient educational aides\nand supportive services, the Oak Hill teachers generally tailor\ntheir curricula to the low median level of the group and ignore\nthe academic needs of students above and below that level.\n- 27 -\n\n![  79.  Plai  ¯¯iff  Rondy  S.  is  a very  br<->ht  eighteen-year  old\nI\n, who has completed his G.E.D. degree and has been assessed as\n¡¦ capable of performing well on a college level.  Rondy would like\n¦. to pursue higher education.  But Oak Hill has done nothing to\n'! arrange college-level courses for him.  Rondy spends his days\n' working on facility maintenance and sitting in the cottage\n¡\nwatching television.\nii.  Special Educational Services\n80.  As at Cedar Knoll (see paragraphs 41-45), the\ndefendants fail to fulfill their federal statutory duties to\nidentify, evaluate, and provide appropriate special education\nand related services to educationally handicapped children who\n' are confined at Oak Hill Youth Center.\n81.  The defendants fail to identify the handicapping condi-\ntions of these children because the defendants do not properly\ntest or evaluate the children, do not obtain their educational\n¦; records from their prior community-based schools, and do not\n' employ persons trained and qualified to identify children with\nj:\nspecific learning and educational handicaps.\n'•  82. The evaluation procedures employed at Oak Hill are\ndeficient, in that defendants rely heavily on tests administered\nby people who have not been properly trained to administer them,\nand the evaluations are conducted by persons lacking specialized\n! knowledge in the specific areas of disability.\n!  83. The defendants violate their duty to provide appro-\npriate special educational services to all handicapped Oak Hill\nresidents, in that:  (a) Children who are truly handicapped, but\nhave never been identified as such by Oak Hill, are placed in\nregular classrooms and foreclosed from special educational\n' services; (b) Defendants fail to prepare Individualized\nEducation Plans appropriate to the specific needs of the handi-\ncapped children, even when the facility does identify their\nhandicaps; and (c) Even when defendants do prepare or obtain a\nI  - 28 -\n\nj proper Indiv  ualized Education Plan, tt`^` services actually\n¡\n| provided to the child do not fulfill the specifications of the\ni plan and do not adequately serve the child's special educational\n¡ needs.\n¡  84.  In the course of evaluating and placing children, the\n¡ defendants furthermore fail to afford Oak Hill residents and\ni\ntheir parents their procedural due process rights.  Defendants\nfail to properly notify residents' parents of changes in their\nchildren's educational settings, identifications of handicaps,\nand scheduling of meetings to prepare Individualized Education\nFlans, fail to obtain these parents' written consent for\npreplacement evaluations, and fail to properly advise these\nparents of their procedural rights to contest the facility's\n¡¡ evaluation.\ny\n\\`  85.  The defendants have failed to identify the educational\n!i\nhandicaps of Gerald R., who attends regular educational classes\nat Oak Hill School.  Private psychiatric and psychological\nassessments of Gerald found that he suffers from a learning\ndisability, developmental language disorder, and is in need of\nspecial educational services.  Yet, when Gerald was evaluated by\nOak Hill's educational assessor, the assessor failed to\nrecognize Gerald's handicaps or recommend special education\nclasses.\n86.  The defendants have similarly failed to adequately\nevaluate the educational needs of plaintiff Omar H.  While in\nthe community, Omar was found to be educationally handicapped\nand was placed in a special education school.  A Child Guidance\nClinic evaluation determined that Omar functions in the mildly\nmentally retarded range and suffers from cognitive deficits in\nvisual-motor performance.  But Oak Hill has chosen to place Omar\nin a regular education setting with nothing more than Chapter I\nsupplementary services.  In changing Omar's special educational\nstatus, defendants failed to comply with the substantive and\nprocedural criteria of the federal statute.\n- 29 -\n\n:  87.  Pla  tiff Willie H. was identi*¯ed as educationally\n¡\n' handicapped by the Oak Hill staff.  But, in evaluating Willie\nand preparing an Individualized Education Plan, the defendants\nI\n; failed to comply with the substantive and procedural require-\ni\nments of the federal statute.  Moreover, the facility does not\nactually provide Willie with the services promised in his\nInâividualizeâ Education Plan.\nC.  Vocational Training Services\n88.  Vocational training should be a vital component of the\nOak Hill rehabilitative program.  The residents of Oak Hill tend\nto be older than those at Cedar Knoll; most of the Oak Hill\nresidents are between the ages of 16 and 19.  Because of their\nacademically deprived backgrounds, most of these youths have\nlittle prospects for or interest in pursuing higher education\nand professional careers.  They intend to enter the job market\nas quickly as possible, but their lack of any vocational skills\nrenders them virtually unemployable.  If Oak Hill is to fulfill\nits function of rehabilitating these youths and preparing them\nfor a productive future, then adequate vocational training is\ncrucial.\n89.  In spite of these compelling considerations, the\ndefendants fail to provide meaningful vocational training at Oak\nHill.  The only true vocational training class taught by a\nqualified instructor, is a class in barbering.  The class serves\nonly a handful of students.  Moreover, the class is of marginal\nvalue since it teaches only traditional barbering, rather than\nl|\nthe more competitive skill of hair-styling.\n90.  Plaintiff Gerald R., who is committed to Oak Hill,\nsuffers from the lack of vocational training services.  A\nprivate psychiatrist and psychologist found that Gerald needs\nsuch services, and even the diagnostic staff at Oak Hill\nconcluded that Gerald needs to \"learn a marketable skill.\"\nNevertheless, defendants have not made any provision for his\n'` learning such a skill while at Oak Hill.\ni\n- 30 -\n\nI  .  91.  When plaintiff Maurice B. appea  i for disposition, the\n¦| Probation Department's social summary recommended that Maurice\n\"be committed to DHS and that he be prepared for vocational\ntraining and employment during his time at the Children's\nCenter.\"  Maurice, who was committed to Oak Hill and is now\ntwenty years old, is in the barbering class.  Even after he\ncompletes this class, his prospects for employment will have\nbeen only marginally improved.\nD.  Mental Health Services\n92.  The psychiatric services at Oak Hill are provided on a\npart-time contractual basis by Dr. Andres Aceituno, who provides\n20 hours of services per week, and Dr. William Goldstein, who\ni\n' provides 10 hours per week.  As earlier described  (see paragraph\n' 51, supra), Dr. Aceituno has difficulties in communicating with\nresidents because of his limited facility with the English\nlanguage.  In continuing to retain his services, and indeed\ni\n¦ relying on him for the bulk of psychiatric services at Oak Hill,\n¦ defendants have violated their duty to provide children at Oak\n` Hill with adequate psychiatric assistance.\n¡  93.  Defendants employ only two psychologists, Robert Diener\nand Samuel Stayton, to provide therapy services for all of Oak\n`¦ Hill and also to prepare psychological assessments of all newly\ncommitted children.  As a result, defendants have curtailed\ntherapy services in the following manner:\n\\\\  a.  The defendants deny therapy services to\nthe entire population of detained children,\nwith the exception of those children for\nwhom therapy has been court-ordered;\nb.  Among the committed population, defendants\n¡  reserve therapy for the most disturbed\n·  residents and thereby deny services to\n¦\nl¦\n'`  children who, although only mildly disturbed,\nare in need of therapy.\n- 31 -\n\n94.  Plai  .iff Gerald R. has substan  al mental health\nneeds.  A private psychiatrist who examined Gerald at length,\nfound that he suffers from major recurrent depression and needs\n\"individual as well as group counseling on a daily basis.\"  A\nprivate psychologist similarly concluded that Gerald should\n\"[p]articipatte] in counseling.\"  Nonetheless, during the five\nmonths that Gerald was confined in pre-trial and pre-disposition\ndetention at Oak Hill, he received no mental health services\nwhatsoever.  When Gerald was subsequently committed to Oak Hill,\nthe facility psychologist did not review court records\ncontaining the prior psychiatric assessment of Gerald.  Gerald\nwas not placed into therapy and does not receive any mental\nhealth services at Oak Hill.\nE. Medical Services\n95.  At Oak Hill, like at Cedar Knoll, the defendants fail\n¦¯ to provide twenty-four a day medical services by a physician or\n¡j\n¦¦ even a registered nurse.  The counselors and other direct care\nj!\nstaff at Oak Hill are not trained in first-aid or how to deal\n¦¦\n¦ with medical emergencies.  If a resident sustains a serious\n¦ injury during the evening or weekend hours when the nurse is\n, off-duty, the counselors frequently defer any action (or medical\nattention) until the nurse's return.  Moreover, even when the\ncounselors perceive the need to transport the resident to the\n¦i\nhospital at Forest Haven or to D.C. General Hospital, there are\n¡i\n, inadequate procedures, staff and facilities for rapidly trans-\n¡ì\nporting the resident.\n96.  Plaintiff Gerald R. was severely injured in November of\n1983 when he was struck in the mouth by another resident.  One\nof his teeth was knocked out, two other teeth were loosened, and\n!i\nhe was bleeding  from the mouth.  The injury occurred at night,\nand the counselors did not take him for any medical  attention\ni\n¦ that night.  The following day, at Gerald's insistence, he was\n- 32 -\n\ntaken to thf ¯\"entist. But the facility Ms never arranged for\n¡, Gerald to receive the replacement tooth he needs.\nF.  Counseling Services, Social Services,\nand Direct Care\n97.  Like at Cedar Knoll, defendants deal with staff\nshortages at Oak Hill by allowing counselors to work over-time\nfor higher pay.  Many of the counselors at Oak Hill work as many\nas sixty to eighty hours in a single week.  As a result, they\nare irritable and short-tempered with the residents and fail to\nprovide adequate supervision and care.\n98.  Defendants fail to arrange adequate supervision of\ncounselors' work, and fail to provide adequate and consistent\ntraining of counselors.\n99.  The caseworkers (or \"social service representatives\")\nat Oak Hill, like those at Cedar Knoll, lack the requisite\ntraining and certification to provide social work services.  As\na result, these workers fail to adequately assess residents'\nneeds, counsel the residents, and arrange for appropriate\nservices.  The caseworkers are not properly supervised and do\nnot receive a consistent program of in-service training.\n100.  Although a large proportion of the population of Oak\nHill suffers from drug abuse and drug dependency problems,\ndefendants fail to provide any drug counseling to these\nchildren.  (Although the facility at one time provided a drug\ncounseling program for a small number of residents, that program\nhas been discontinued.)  Even in cases in which the court has\nspecifically ordered drug counseling for a particular child,\ndefendants frequently fail to provide or arrange for such\ncounseling.\n101.  Plaintiff Maurice B. came to Oak Hill with a history of\nsevere abuse of PCP.  Recognizing this problem, the Oak Hill\npsychiatrist stated:  \"A drug rehabilitation program is clearly\nindicated and necessary for Maurice.  It should begin as soon\n- 33 -\n\nj as possible.  Vet, defendants fail to . ovide Maurice with any\n: drug counseling.\nj\ni\nG.  Climate of Violence\n102.  Like at Cedar Knoll (see paragraphs 61-63, supra), the\ndefendants have created a climate of violence at Oak Hill.\nInadequately trained and supervised counselors, short-tempered\nfrom long over-time hours, periodically assault the children who\nare in their care.\n103.  As a result of the counselors' inadequate supervision\nof the residents, there are frequent assaults of residents by\nother residents.  The defendants, moreover, have failed to\nestablish classification procedures that would place children in\nli\ncottages on the basis of their age and physical stature;\nchildren are randomly assigned to cottages, and children of\nvarying ages and sizes all live in the same cottage.\n104.  As a result of these actions and omissions of the\ndefendants, many of the children residing at Oak Hill suffer\nphysical harm.  The remaining residents suffer psychological\nharm from living in an atmosphere of constant fear and\nviolence.\n105.  Plaintiff Maurice B. is one of the children who was\nphysically assaulted by a counselor.  In January of 1985, an Oak\nRill counselor responded to what he perceived as impertinence on\nMaurice's part by physically striking Maurice with his fist.\n106.  In November of 1983, during a period of inadequate\ncounselor supervision of the residents, another resident\nassaulted plaintiff Gerald R. and knocked out one of his teeth,\nloosened two other teeth, and left Gerald bruised and bloody.\n- 34 -\n\nI  H.  Procedures for Disciplini'^ - Residents\n!i\njl\n¦  107.  In an Order issued on November 3, 1976, the Family\njl\n¡! Division in In re Savoy, J-4808-70, established  detailed\nj  procedures for disciplining  children who are confined in\nI!\n¦¡ District of Columbia  juvenile detention facilities.  The\nII\ndefendants subsequently incorporated these procedures into\nInstitutional Rule 4.12.\n108.  The defendants, however, have failed to take the steps\nnecessary to ensure that these procedures are followed on a\ndaily basis by the direct care staff of Oak Hill.\n109.  In contravention of the standards established in In re\nSavoy and Rule 4.12, the Oak Hill counselors frequently impose\nj¦\n:!  punishments without an adjudicatory hearing, impose periods of\nji\nj; seclusion exceeding 7 days for a single incident of misbehavior,\n'  and impose \"group punishment\" of an entire unit for the trans-\n!¦\ngressions of a single resident of that unit.\n1  110.  In one of these episodes of \"group punishment,\"\ni;\ni  plaintiff Maurice B. and all the boys in his unit were placed in\nli\nseclusion as punishment for one of the boys1 throwing a snowball j\n••  i\nat another cottage.  j\n;  j\nI.  Recreational Services  j\n¡\n111.  The recreation program at Oak Hill consists of basket- ;\nball in the gymnasium, billiards in the cottage, and\nnon-physical activities such as television, movies and card\ngames. The Oak Hill staff do not ensure that all the residents\nhave an adequate amount of daily major muscle activities.\n112.  The defendants have failed to establish an adequate,\nstructured physical education program at Oak Hill.  Defendants\nfurthermore have failed to establish a program to teach leisure\ntime recreational activities such as music and crafts.\n- 35 -\n\n¡  113.  P  intiff Willie H. spends h`¯ ¯ free time playing\n'• cards or watching television.  The only major physical  activity\n1 in which he engages is an occasional basketball game in the\nI!\n! gymnasium.\nJ.  Procedures for Attorney-Client Communications  ¡\n¡\n114.  In both their visitation policies and telephone\npolicies, defendants improperly interfere with residents' access\nto their attorneys.\n115.  If an attorney wishes to meet with a detained client,\n¦ defendants will transport the child to the Receiving Home.  But\ndefendants have failed to establish sufficient interview rooms\nat the Receiving Home.  As a result, attorneys frequently are\nunable to meet with their clients because all of the rooms are\nalready filled by other attorneys, probation officers, or mental\n;' health professionals.\nj:  116.  Defendants have, moreover, adopted a policy of\n!! precluding transportation of committed residents to the\n¦ Receiving Home for the purpose of attorney-client meetings.\nI Consequently, an attorney representing a child in a post-\ncommitment proceeding must travel to Laurel, Maryland, in order\nto meet with his or her client.\n1  117.  The defendants have adopted a policy of closing Oak\nHill's telephone switchboard in the evenings, and thereby pre¯\ní:\neluding any calls to residents during these hours.  The defen-\ndants' policy severely impairs attorney-client  communications\ni:\nsince attorneys who are in court all day must use the evening\nhours to call clients.\nK.  Policies for Family Visitation\n118.  Like at Cedar Knoll (see paragraphs 71-72, supra), the\ndefendants limit their provision of free transportation for\n¡\n- 36 -\n\nt  mitted ch  iren's parents to one day  month.  Since many of\nthe children's parents are impoverished and do not own cars,\nthey cannot travel to Laurel to visit their children on more\nthan this single occasion each month.\ni\n|  119.  When plaintiff Willie H. was committed to Oak Hill,\ni the facility's psychologist reported that Willie needs\nI\n\"emotional support\" and that the facility should \"te]ncourage\nfrequent visiting by Willie's family as long as he remains at\nOak Hill.\"  Notwithstanding any encouragement that may or may\nnot have occurred, Willie's family cannot visit him more than\none day a month because they are impoverished and must rely on\n¦ the limited transportation facilities provided by defendants.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\n120.  With respect to each of the following Counts,\nplaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all of the\nallegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 119.\nCOUNT I\n121.  The totality of the conditions in the District of\nColumbia juvenile detention facilities, including the physical\nstructures, programs, practices and policies, violates detained\nand committed children's rights, under the laws of the District\nof Columbia, to appropriate care and treatment.  The totality of\nconditions also violates these children's statutory rights to an\nappropriate education under the laws of the District of Columbia\nand the laws of the United States, their right to rehabilitative\ntreatment under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nand their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights to be free from\nharm, unnecessary restraint, and cruel and unusual punishment.\n- 37 -\n\nj  COUNT II\ni\nì\ni\n¦  122.  Defendants have failed to provide detained and commit-\nted children confined in District of Columbia detention facili-\ni ties with suitable and adequate educational services, in\n¦\n'; violation of these children's statutory rights to appropriate\ncare and treatment under D.C. Code SS 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as\ninterpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2), their statutory right to\neducation under D.C. Code 5 31-401, and their rights under the\nFifth and Eighth Amendments. In failing to provide adequate and\nappropriate special education and related services, defendants\nhave furthermore violated the substantive and procedural\nrequirements of the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C.\nS 1401 et seq.), D.C. Code SS 31-401, and 403, and the Fifth and\nEighth Amendments.\nCOUNT III\n123.  By failing to provide adequate medical services and\nadequate mental health services to the detained and committed\nresidents of juvenile detention facilities, defendants have\nviolated these children's statutory rights to appropriate care\nand treatment under D.C. Code SS 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as\ninterpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2), their right to \"related\nservices\" under the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C.\ni ¡\nS 1401 et seq.), their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights to be\n' i\n' free from harm and cruel and unusual punishment, and their Fifth\nü\nAmendment right to rehabilitative treatment.\nCOUNT IV\n,  124.  By failing to provide humane and safe living condi-\n• ¦ tions in the juvenile detention facilities, defendants have\nviolated detained and committed children's rights to appropriate\n' care and treatment under D.C. Code SS 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as\nI!\njj interpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule -2 )3,8  t-heir Fifth and Eighth\ni\n\ni Amendment rights to be free from harm an  cruel and unusual\n! punishment, and their Fifth Amendment right to rehabilitative\ntreatment.\nCOUNT V\n125.  The defendants' failure to provide adequate vocational\ntraining services, counseling and social services, and recrea-\ntional services, and their failure to provide adequate means for\nparental visitation violates detained and committed children's\nrights to appropriate care and treatment under D.C. Code SS\n16-2313 (b) and 16-2320 (as interpreted in SCR-Juv. Rule 2),\ntheir right to \"related services\" under the Education of the\nHandicapped Act (20 U.S.C. S 1401 et seq.), their Fifth and\nI\n¡ Eighth Amendment rights to be free from harm and cruel and\nunusual treatment, and their Fifth Amendment due process right\nto rehabilitative treatment.\nCOUNT VI\n•  126.  The defendants' failure to provide adequate facilities\nr\nfor attorneys' communications with and visits with children\nconfined in District of Columbia juvenile detention facilities\nviolates these children's Fifth Amendment due process right to\naccess to the courts and legal assistance.\n!!\nCOUNT VII\n127.  The climate of violence prevailing in District of\nColumbia juvenile detention facilities (including direct\n`'` counselor abuse of residents and counselors' failure to pro-\ntect residents from other residents) and the excessive and\n: improper use of seclusion and other disciplinary sanctions\nì¦ violates detained and committed children's rights to appropriate\n' care and treatment under D.C. Code SS 16-2313(b) and 16-2320 (as\ninterpreted in SCR¯Juv. Rule 2), their Fifth Amendment due\n- 39 -\n\nprocess right  to receive adequate treat  nt and to be safe-\nguarded from summary punishment, and their Eighth Amendment\n¡\n¦ right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\nRELIEF REQUESTED\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for the following relief:\n1.  That this Court determine, pursuant to Rules 23 and 23-1\nof the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, that this action\nis a proper class action and that plaintiffs are proper class\nrepresentatives;\n2.  That the Court enter a declaratory judgment, pursuant to\nRule 57 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure,\ndeclaring that the totality of the circumstances of confine-\nment —  the facilities, conditions, programs, practices and\npolicies —  at the District of Columbia juvenile detention\nfacilities violates plaintiffs' rights to adequate care and\nappropriate treatment under the laws of the District of Columbia\nand the laws of the United States, and their rights to due\nprocess of law and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment\nas guaranteed by the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the\nConstitution of the United States;\n3.
