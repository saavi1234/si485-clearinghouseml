    "summary": "<p>On August 19, 1991, the United States Department of Justice [DOJ] issued its findings letter to the mayor of Washington, DC providing details of its investigation of the Village Nursing Home (DC Village) conducted pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA).  DC Village was licensed as a long-term-care nursing home for geriatric patients but overflow from other institutions was causing additional residents to be placed in the facility.  These residents included adults with intellectual and severe physical disabilities along with mentally ill children and adults.  The investigation determined that DC Village was not providing proper care to residents who were mentally ill or had intellectual disabilities.  The conditions that caused constitutional violations included failure to provide adequate training to staff, inadequate psychiatric care, insufficient staff, and inadequate record keeping.  The DOJ suggested remedial measures to bring the institution into compliance with constitutional standards.  </p><p>The DOJ conducted follow-up investigations in 1992 and 1994 and found that the conditions had not improved.  Additional problems at the facility included inadequate medical care resulting in the death of many residents.  In a letter dated October 11, 1994, the DOJ suggested additional remedial measures to cure the constitutional violations.   </p><p>On May 19, 1995, the United States filed a lawsuit against the District of Columbia in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The complaint alleged violations of the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Titles XIX and XVIII of the Social Security Act.  The District of Columbia Long-Term Care Ombudsman intervened in the action.  The United States and the Ombudsman moved for preliminary injunction. On July 5, 1995 a hearing was held regarding the preliminary injunction and the parties entered into a stipulated order.  The District of Columbia agreed to implement a number of remedies, including changing specific medical practices related to the treatment of ulcers and incontinence.  It agreed to provide adequate nursing staff, remedy shortages in food and other supplies, to place patients with intellectual disabilities into community-based or residential programs, and to pay vendors providing services to the facility.  Court monitor Harriet Fields provided reports regarding the District's compliance.  </p><p>In August of 1995, the District decided to close the facility and failed to provide a plan for the transfer of residents to other facilities.  It failed to follow the terms of the previous stipulation and began transferring patients without supervision by the court.   On December 20, 1995, the district court (Judge Thomas F. Hogan) granted the United States' motion for contempt due to the District's non-compliance with the stipulated order.  On February 23, 1996, Judge Hogan ordered the suspension of the outplacement of DC Village's residents until it complied with previous court orders by creating a transition team to ensure that placement decisions were made on an individualized basis.  </p><p>The Court Monitor's reports indicated that the District was also not compliant in paying its vendors and Judge Hogan entered several orders regarding this issue.    </p><p>A letter from the Court Monitor on June 28, 1996 noted that all patients at DC Village had been outplaced but that the District was refusing to provide payment to the Georgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC) for the services it provided in the outplacement process.  On July 15, 1996, Judge Hogan ordered the District to pay GUCDC.  Judge Hogan denied a motion to dismiss the monitor in order to evaluate the former resident's placements and determine whether they were appropriate.  </p><p>The Court Monitor provided a final report on January 21, 1997, which included testimonials of former residents and indicated that they were in appropriate placements.  Judge Hogan entered an Order on May 12, 1997, closing the case and ordering the District to pay $100 to each former resident and $50,000 to the Ombudsman.  </p><p></p>",

No. 95-948, TFH,\nD.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV), Court Order, July 6,1995;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6, 1995;\nCourt Order, December 22, 1996;\nCourt Order, February 23, 1996\nDear Judge Hogan:\nThis is an update on the outplacement of the residents of DCV to their new homes since my May\n9 letter to the Court.\nThere are 49 residents remaining ax DCV.  Of this number 30 residents have no identified\noutplacement site.  This is of very serious concern, especially in light of the District of Columbia's\narbitrary and artificial projected closing date of May 31,1996 - next week.  Pursuant to the Court\nOrders, residents must be outplaced to the most appropriate sites to meet their individual needs.\nThe Mayor of the District was briefly at DCV on Monday afternoon, May 20. According to the\nInterim-Administrator for Long Term Care, the purpose of the visit was to see the staS, the\nresidents, and to inspect the facility, auditorium, etc., for the Summer Youth Services Initiative\nand Leadership Program which is scheduled to commence at DCV on June 24.  Representatives\nfrom this program toured with the Mayor.\nI met with the Mayor briefly and told the Mayor that the facility cannot close until all the residents\nare appropriately outplaced to sites which can meet their individual needs; that there are a number\nof residents who have no site identified to date; that between now and next week it is highly\nunlikely appropriate sites will be found; and that the residents now left at DCV are the District's\nmost vulnerable citizens.  I told the Mayor that Dr. Harvey Sloane the Commissioner of Public\n\nHAY-22-96  WED 03:58  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 03\nHealth and I were meeting with the D.C. Health Care Association (DCHCA) on Tuesday to make\nthem aware of the need for outplacement sites within the District, and to plead with them to\naccept the residents.  DCHGA consists of the administrators of the 20 nursing homes within the\nDistrict of Columbia.  I also told the Mayor that I am prepared to meet with each facility to\nreview the residents needs and to facilitate a smooth transition from DCV to their new homes.  I\nalso told the Mayor that I am willing to take any proactive steps to help the residents of DCV find\nthe most appropriate new homes.  The Mayor stated that in \"government if you don't give\ndeadlines you never get anything done\" and that of course the facility would not be closed until\nthe residents have a home.\nI am confidant that the Mayor understands that the residents cannot be outplaced until the most\nappropriate sites are identified to meet the residents individual needs pursuant to the Court\nOrders.\nOn Monday evening at DCV a meeting was held for the residents with no identified outplacement\nsite, their family members, and guardians.  If a family member had a preference for a particular\nnursing home for their relatives, they were encouraged to contact that facility directly, because\nfamily intervention is often persuasive to long term care facility operators.  In addition family\nmembers were encouraged to contact Ms. Corrie Kemp in the Social Services Department and the\nOmbudsperson, Ms. Sarodei Childs.  There was genuine love and concern among family members\nand guardians present.\nDr. Sloane, myself, and Ms. Gladys Fountain did meet yesterday, Tuesday, with DCHCA at their\nluncheon meeting held this month at Hadley Hospital (site of Hadley Skilled Nursing Facility\nwhich has accepted 39 DCV residents) and each of us spoke briefly.  I introduced myself as\nrepresenting the residents and the Court, and identified the nursing homes in the District that have\nand have not accepted and admitted DCV residents. I also offered to work with the facilities as\noften as necessary, to meet with their administrators, directors of nursing, direct care staff, social\nworkers, and admissions coordinators to effect a smooth transition.  I believe Dr. Sloane, Ms.\nFountain, and I presented a concerned, dedicated, and cohesive effort to help the community help\nthe residents. We invited the attendees to \"come down the hill\" (which is where DCV is\ngeographically from Hadley Hospital) and meet the residents.\nThe residents remaining at DCV with no identified outplacement site are no different from any\nother nursing home population, except for the fact they do not have a home.  Also, a number are\nyounger than the average age nursing home population and, therefore, could benefit by being\nmeaningfully engaged in their environments through vocational programs as identified in my May\n9 letter to the Court on page four.\nA tribute to a municipality is the ability to care for its citizens who have no one else to care for\nthem and no place else to go. DCV played this role for many years, this chapter must end with\ndignity.  The feelings and atmosphere of sadness, bewilderment, and rejection among the\nremaining residents at DCV is perhaps best captured by Mr. M.W., 40 years old, who profoundly\n\nHAVr22-96  WED 03:58  NCCNHR  FAX  HO.  2023322949  P.04\nasks these simple questions:\n\"Don't other facilities realize that the DCV residents are homeless?\"\n\"Are the [outplacement team] just giving up?\"\n\"What happens to the ones that have been refused [by other nursing\nhomes]?\"\nuIs May 31, really DCV closing date?\"\nA weakness in the District's long term care system is highlighted by the outplacement process at\nDCV.  There is a lag between the needs of the current long term care resident eligible population\nin the District  and the services facilities are willing to provide.  The fact that there are so many\nresidents remaining with no identified outplacement site partly relates to the fact that there are few\noptions to placement other than institutionalized long term care.  The District of Columbia lags\nbehind most all jurisdictions in this country in applying for medicaid waivers to redirect federal\nfunding from institutional to community based long term care.  Redirecting funding affords more\nappropriate and greater variety of care settings options for individuals requiring long term care.\nThe need for a medicaid waiver for institutionalized long term care was first identified in my\nNovember 30, 199S, Status Report to the Court on page 22.  Required for that were the Annual\nCost Reports and the Budget for DCV which were never forthcoming from the defendants.  With\na medicaid waiver, creative and appropriate sites can be identified and developed to meet the\nchanging profile and needs of the long term care population.  Medicaid waivers usually afford care\nto be given in settings more cost effective than institutional long term care. For the best interests\nof the long term care resident population of the District of Columbia and for the nation's capital\ncity to become responsive to current trends and needs in long term care, the District must avail\nitself of this care option and put behind its inexplicable failure to do so to date.\nResidents with Mental Retardation\nThere is still no identified outplacement site for Mr. PL.  Tomorrow morning, Wednesday, May\n22,  there is a meeting at DCV with Georgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC)\nto discuss Mr. P.L.  Mr. PX.'s last medical evaluation was conducted one year ago.  According\nto some GUCDC staflC given his fragile medical condition, a re-«valuation of his medical status by\nexperts in mental retardation identified by GUCDC would be in order.  Some have speculated that\nperhaps an appropriate site would be Health Care Institute.  This is the where the three medically\nfragile residents, Ms. A.B., Ms. C.L., and Ms. C.W. were outplaced in March.  GUCDC provides\non-site training of staff and interaction with the residents several times a week pursuant to the\nCourt Orders and for the best care interests of the residents.  According to GUCDC the Health\nCare Institute staff find GUCDC's input very valuable for their care-giving to these residents.\nEnrollment and attendance at off-site day programs have not begun for the two residents, Ms.\nAJL and Mr. K.F., outplaced to Wholisric Habilitative Programs.  The Individual Habilitation\nPlans for three of the six residents at D.C. Family Services identifies attendance at off-site day\n\nttAYr22-96 WED 03:59 NCCNHR FAX NO. 2023322949 P.  05\nprograms.  To date sites have not been identified.  The District must follow-through with\nidentifying and enrolling the residents with all due attention and haste pursuant to the Court\nOrders commencing with the July 6 Court Order. The defendants' case managers at the Mental\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration must ensure that the day program\nprovisions of the July 6, 1995, Court Order are enforced and that the residents with mental\nretardation constitutional rights are protected.\nNational Patient Care Systems received payment of $47,861,000 on Monday, May 20.\nMs.  Alberta Brasfield, Executive Director of DCV and the licensed nursing home administrator, is\nto become administrator at Stoddard Baptist Nursing Home on June 3.\nThe identification of outplacement sites for the remaining residents at DCV will be carefully\nmonitored to ensure that the residents are outplaced to the most appropriate settings to meet their\nindividualized needs pursuant to the Court Orders. Following that, residents will be monitored in\ntheir outplacement sites until I can assure the Court that the residents remain in apppropriate\nsettings and that the staff is knowledgeable in providing care to meet their individualized needs.\nJudge Hogan, it is a privilege to serve your Court for the best interests of the long term care\nresidents of the District of Columbia.\nSincerely,\n0\nHarriet A.

District of Columbia\nl l ll  III  IIIII  I II\nNH-DC-001-026\nThe Honorable Thomas F. Hogan\nU.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Ave, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC 20001\nRe:  The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et ai, Civ. No. 95-948, TFH,\nD.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV), Court Order, July 6, 1995;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6,1995;\nCourt Order, December 22, 1996;\nCourt Order, February 23, 1996\nDear Judge Hogan:\nThis is an update since my recent letter to the Court of April 25 on the outplacement of the\nresidents of DCV to their new homes.\nTo date there are 62 residents remaining at DCV.  Of this number 35 residents still have no\nidentified outplacement site.  Eight residents are tentatively scheduled to be outplaced during the\nremainder of this week.\nResidents with Mental Retardation\nSix residents with mental retardation were outplaced this week to D.C. Family Services' group\nhome site on O Street, S.E.  Mr. R.W., Mr. T.S., and Mr. F.McE. were outplaced Tuesday and\nMs.  S.A., Ms. S.P., and Mr. T.M. were outplaced Wednesday.  DCV staff accompanied the\nresidents and will remain at the site for the day and evening shifts for the remainder of this week.\nGeorgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC) staif will be conducting orientation\nand training for the new direct care staff in the residents' new homes.  D.C. Family Services\nreports that the presence of the DCV staff on-site is very helpful to their new staff.\nThere has been community concern and some opposition to the presence of this group home.\nSeemingly some of the opposition is related to the comparatively large number of group homes in\n\nttAY-09-96  THU  17:24  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 03\nWard 7 and also apparently to the manner in which the block and community was introduced to\npresence of the group home.  I cannot believe for a moment the opposition is related to the\nresidents who will be living now at this site, for to me they are truly angels who did not asked to\nbe born with their challenges, but bravely live with them which is an inspiration to us all.  The\nombudsperson, Ms. Sarodel Childs and I visited the group home on Tuesday morning, May 7,\nbefore the residents were outplaced.  We met with some of the new staff and the construction\nperson for DC. Family Services, who with his partner has lovingly restored the home to meet the\nspecial needs of the residents.  We also introduced ourselves and talked for a time with one of the\nneighbors who was walking by about his and his neighbors concerns.  We invited him and his\nfamily to visit with the residents at anytime and to continue to apprise us of his and his neighbors\nconcerns.\nMs.  Sarodel Childs continues her fine advocacy and review of residents outplacement packets.  As\na result, she was able to prevent the continuation of an apparent District of Columbia Mental\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration Policy of not transferring residents'\nfunds.  The residents outplaced this week have the same protections now as the general\npopulation of DCV residents outplaced, and that is, their accounts from Independence Federal\nSavings Bank are transferred to the new payee at the new receiving facility.  Based on what has\ntranspired in Court and representations made by the defendants about the residents personal needs\nallowance (PNA), it was disconcerting to me that it took proactive intervention by the\nombudsperson for the reactive steps taken by the District of Columbia to comply with federal law\nand regulations regarding residents' funds-\nD.C. Family Services and Wholistic Habilitative Services have received interim rates for the O\nStreet and Bunker Hill Road group home sites, respectively.\nOn May 2,1 visited Wholistic Habilitative Services group home on Bunker Hill Road, N.E. with\nDr. Frieda Butler, the nursing home systems expert consultant to the Court Monitor.  This site is\nthe new home for Ms. A.R. and Mr. K.F.  The home appeared bright, cheerful, and clean.  We\nvisited at dinner time.  The food appeared nourishing and well balanced.  The residents were\nreceiving attention from the staff on a one to one basis.  The neighborhood is certainly conducive\nto outdoor activities, and the residents had just returned from a walk around the block with the\nstaff.\nA concern which will be monitored is that in the home there were limited resources for\nstimulation and physical activity.  In addition, the Habilitation and Transition plans for Ms. A.R.\nand Mr. K.F. call for enrollment in off-site Day Programs so that they may be meaningfully\nstimulated beyond maintenance  to meet their full potential and individualized needs.  Mr. K.F. has\nbeen accepted by one, but there is no date for commencing participation.  An application for Ms.\nA.R. is pending.  The progress of application and enrollment in off-site Day Programs will be\nmonitored and reported to the Court.  Until Ms. A.R. and Mr. K.F. are attending and\nmeaningfully engaged in outside day programs, the defendants are not in compliance with the\nCourt Orders.\nTT\n\nMAY-09-96  THU  17:24  NCCNHR  FAX  NO,  2023322949  P. 04\nGUCDC has commenced providing inservice and training to staff  at both group home sites,\nWholistic and D.C. Family Services.  This is an admirable model for community placement and it\nis a tribute to the Court that it exists.\nThere is one remaining resident with mental retardation at DCV, Mr. P.L.  There is no site\nidentified for him.  Mr. P.L. is wheelchair bound and because of his physical needs his chair is\nwider, 27 inches, and longer, 67 inches, than most group homes are structurally able to\naccommodate.  Until the dimensions of his wheelchair were actually known, Mr. PL. was\nscheduled for outplacement to D.C. Family Services 0  Street she.  According to Mr. Butler\ntoday, there is no vacancy \"within the system\" for Mr. PL.  This is of very serious concern to me,\nfor Mr. P.L. is truly where he should not be to meet his individualized needs in continual violation\nof the Court Orders.  Immediate and proactive planning is needed by the District to find the most\nappropriate site for Mr. PL. to meet his individualized needs pursuant to the Court Orders.  The\nplanning for this will be closely monitored and reported to the Court on a regular basis.\nResidents Moving to Independent Living\nMr. C.W. was discharged to his new home this week.  Ms. Peggy Graves has been instrumental in\ncoordinating the planning for the outplacement of the three residents who will be moving to\nindependent living, including Mr. C.W.  Within the best of her abilities, Ms. Graves is being as\nthorough as possible to meet the residents individualized needs.  A complete list of services and\nprograms established for the residents will be profiled in a future letter to the Court.  Mr. C. W.'s\nfood stamps are scheduled to be ready on May 17.  In the interim, he has supplies of food goods\nfrom DCV and a local Church.  Mr.C. W. should receive his first SSI check on May 22.  He was\ndischarged with $70. My concern about the need for cash as profiled in my April 25th letter to\nthe Court is still valid.\nMs.  M.M. is scheduled to be discharged next week.  There is still no site identified for the third\nresident, Mr. M.W.\nI have an overall concern with the lack of consistent proactive planning.  Since my last submission\nto the Court, another example became apparent, and once raised by the Court Monitor, reactive\nsteps have been taken by DCV for the best interests of the residents.\nFor weeks at the weekly outplacement meetings, Mr. Silas Butler reported that two of the three\nresidents scheduled to be outplaced to independent living would be enrolled in rehabilitation\nmedicine programs because these two residents, Mr. C.W. and Mr. M.W., have amputations of\nboth their legs.  At a planning meeting for Mr. C.W. last Wednesday afternoon, May 1, no\nmention was made of follow-up medical care.  I inquired about this and the medical director at\nDCV responded that Mr. C.W. could walk into any facility of his choice, go to the admitting area\nand enroll himself.\nI do not believe that residents who have been institutionalized for years should be left to their own\nTin  1  •  TTTTT\n\nHAY-09-96  THU  17:25  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 05\ndevices to negotiate the maze of a medical center to establish their own medical follow-up.  This\nis a daunting task even for the able-bodied among us and often too intimidating to even begin to\ninitiate,  let alone to know how to follow-through.\nI am very distressed, that in retrospect the representations made for weeks at the weekly\noutplacement meetings were not being carried out by the medical director.  Nevertheless, I am\nhappy for Mr. C.W.'s sake, that as a result of the concern raised at the May 1 meeting, Mr. C.W.\nis enrolled (by the medical director) at the rehabilitation medicine program of Washington\nHospital Center, the facility of his choice, and his first appointment is May 17.\nI believe expecting these residents to find and otherwise walk into and enroll themselves for\nmedical care represents an insensitivity to the demands of the new independent lifestyle of the\nDCV residents institutionalized for years.  I was stunned by this expectation and very concerned\nabout the potential negative consequences on the new lifestyle for these DCV residents.  I am\ncommunicating my concern to the Court, so that this iapse in careful attention and planning for\nthe residents does not happen again, and so that the outplacement of the remaining DCV residents\ncontinues with dignity and respect for their individualized needs.\nContinued Concerns Regardine Lack of Proactive Initiatives\nThe concern raised in my April 25th letter to the Court regarding vocational rehabilitation to meet\nthe residents individualized needs is still valid.  It applies not only to the three residents scheduled\nfor independent living, but also to the younger than average-age nursing home residents, who are\nare indeed able-minded although not able-bodied.  In order to meet their individualized needs\nupon outplacement in accordance with the Court Orders, vocational rehabilitation services must\nbe made available to them.  I am concerned about the planning for these services and will closely\nmonitor the situation and report to the Court.\nYesterday, another instance of a lack of proactive initiative became known to me, and greatly\nconcerns me, regarding a resident in the general population awaiting outplacement.  At\nWednesday's weekly outplacement meeting, Mr. R.W. was profiled as scheduled for\noutplacement, yet within the last few weeks he has refused to leave, refused to eat, stopped\nbreathing on a number of occasions, has been admitted a number of times to local hospitals, and\nhas refused treatment.  I have seen situations like this before when human beings will themselves\nto die.  Mr. R.W. has told staff he will not leave DCV.  The trauma of transfer can render an\nindividual with a feeling that there is no recourse left but to take control of one's life in manner\nsimilar to this.\nTo the nursing department's great credit, a nurse aide has been detailed to Mr. R.W.'s room\naround the clock to monitor his breathing.  However, the specialty consult team which provides\ncounseling was not contacted by the medical department, and not contacted until the presence of\nthe Court requested that Ms. Sue Brown to do so immediately.  Ms. Brown followed up and\ninformed me yesterday afternoon that Geriatric Psychological Systems (GPS.) is now scheduled\nTT\n\nHAY-09-96 THU 17:26  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949  P. 06\nto see Mr R.W. today.\nI do have a concern that there will be a few hard to place residents who will have no identified\nsites by the latest projected closing date of DCV in three weeks. For the best interests of the\nresidents in order to be placed in the most appropriate sites to meet their individual needs\npursuant to the Court Orders, residents should not be moved until the most appropriate (not\ninterim) sites are found and provisions for their individualized needs are established with respect\nand dignity.\nIn the most recent \"30 Day Compliance Report' received by me, which is the March report, there\nare a number of hospitalizations listed for dehydration related reasons which had been such a\ngreat source of concern several months.\nOnce again it has come to my attention that the defendants were advised not to meet with nor\nspeak to the Court Monitor.  Friday, May 3, at the District's initiative, a weekly scheduled\nmeeting with Mr. Vernon Hawkins, Dr. Harvey Sloane, Ms. Gladys Fountain, and the Court\nMonitor was to take place at 4pm in Mr. Hawkins' office.  At 3:25pm on Friday, May 3,1\nreceived a phone call canceling this meeting with no rescheduling date.  I subsequently learned,\nthat Mr. Goode in the general counsel's office of the Department of Human Services for the\nDistrict of Columbia, advised the defendants to take this action.  I believe this advice was not\nconstructive and a disservice to the defendants.  It is the role of the Court Monitor to advise the\ndefendants on how to comply with the Court Orders for the best interests of the residents.\nTherefore, the only parties to suffer by this counsel are the defendants and ultimately the\nresidents.\nOutplacement visits\nOn May 2,1 met with Sr. Carol Keehan, President of Providence Hospital, along with Dr. Frieda\nButler.  I shared with Sr. Carol the Court Orders, highlighting those that relate to the\noutplacement of the residents to the most appropriate settings to meet their individualized needs.\nProvidence Hospital is currently managing two nursing homes, the new one built on its premises\nand the facility in Hyattsville, MD, Carroll Manor.  The Hyattsville facility is scheduled to be sold\nand to be operated under new management.  However, Sr. Carol assured me that soon a meeting\nwill be set-up with the new management, the Court Monitor and Sr. Carol to review the Court\nOrders with the new management.  I will follow-up on this and report in a future letter to the\nCourt.\nVendors\nAs of this writing, National Patient Care Systems has not received the Court ordered (at the\ndefendants request) payment past due of $47,761.00, despite the defendants unseemly request of\nthe Court to issue an order to pay this vendor.  The Court graciously issued the Order for the best\ninterests of the residents.  This vendor supplies specialty beds for residents with decubitus ulcers.\n\nMAY-09-96  THU  17:26  NCCNHR  FAX NO.  2023322949  P. 07\nAttached to this letter to the Court is a fax sent to me by National Patient Care Systems\nidentifying invoice numbers and amount due.\nIn a telephone conversation on Wednesday, May 8, with Ms. Janette Michael, consent decree\ncoordinator for the Department of Human Services of the District of Columbia, Ms. Michael\nindicated that the \"check has been cut today... and mailed.\" Ms. Michael indicated that \"as soon\nas she received the Court Order\" which she said she just received, she was able to \"cut the\ncheck\".  Now she is awaiting a Court Order so she may \"cut\" another check to National Patient\nCare Systems for $6300.  The defendants request was dated April 4, the Court Order for payment\nto this vendor was issued April 16. I received my copy April 18.\nMy concern is that the defendants are venturing onto a path of disrespect and abuse of the federal\njudicial system; that requests for Court Orders for payments of vendors will become a pattern\nuntil DCV is closed; and that the Court Orders, as in this instance, will be cavalierly handled and\nstill not honored in a timely fashion.\nMy concern is only heightened by the fact that the Corporation Counsel has asked the Court to\nissue an order for payment to Assur Qual which was never a vendor at DCV providing services to\nthe residents. Rather Assur Qual was the defendants expert in its attempt to refute the need for\nthe Court Order to improve care and services for the residents at DCV.\nThe vendor providing needed and expert direct care to residents, TMS (Therapeutic Management\nSystems), the physical therapists, received partial payment of the January invoice in the amount of\n$2849.  The physical therapists are owed $2296 remaining on the January invoice and $6885 for\nthe February invoice submitted March 11, for a total to date past due of $9181.\nAttached to this letter to the Court is a copy of an \"Account Statement\" from National Nurses\nlisting invoices for which partial payments were made and for which remaining payments are still\ndue according to the vendor.\nGiven the recent article in The Washington Post regarding the removal of contracting authority\nfrom the Department of Human Services, it would be helpful to know to whom questions\nconcerning contracts and vendor payments for services for the residents should be directed.\nOnce again, Judge Hogan, it is a privilege to serve your Court and to work with all concerned\nparties for the best interests of the long term care residents of the District of Columbia.\nSincerely,\nHarriet A.

ANNE HART, DISTRICT\nOF COLUMBIA LONG-TERM\nCiv. No. 95-948 (TFH)\nCARE OMBUDSMAN,\nPlaintiff-Intervenor,\nU.S. v. District of Columbia\nv. I !•••! Ill !!•••• --•\"  \"\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al.,\n•NH:DC-OOI-5IO\"\nDefendants.\nORDER\nFor the reasons set forth in the Court's bench ruling of December 20, 1995, and\nadditionally for the reasons set forth below, it is hereby ORDERED that the plaintiffs motions\nfor contempt and further remedial relief are GRANTED.\nAs stated in the bench ruling, the defendants are in civil contempt of this Court for failing\nto comply with the provisions of the July 6, 1995 stipulated order and subsequent orders of the\nCourt,  jrr NT Pp \"  ™<\"*n* Poocorn Co.. 659 F.2d 1173, 113335 (D.C. Cir. 1981); Pettiesv,\nni^trirt nf Columbia. 897 F.Supp. 626 (D.D.C. 1995) (setting forth elements of civil contempt).\nThe Court's orders have been in effect and have required particular conduct on the part of the\ndefendants, but the defendants have not complied.  The noncompliance exists even though the\nprincipal order at issue here -  the July 6,1995 order -  was stipulated to by the parties and was\nnot imposed unilaterally upon the defendants by the Court  There appears to be no way to\nrationalize the defendant's willingness to enter into the stipulated order with their present\nnoncompliance.\n(3)\n\nThe defendants' noncompliance is widespread and substantial.  The principal areas of\nconcern presently involve the payment of vendors, the provision of supplies and services\nnecessary for adequate care, the discharge and outplacement of residents with mental\nretardation, and the psychiatric evaluation of residents with mental illness.\nAs for vendor payment, the Court ordered that the defendants pay vendors supplying\ngoods and services to D.C. Village within 45 days of receiving invoices in order to avoid work\nstoppages and supply shortages.  By the defendants' own admission, at least $161,000 in vendor\npayments are overdue beyond the 45-day period.  This figure was provided by counsel during\nthe status call on December 20, 1995, but the defendant's written submissions suggest an even\nhigher indebtedness total of $380,323.34.  Whichever figure is correct,1 there is no disputing the\nsubstantial backlog in payments.  The nonpayment has caused more than one threatened removal\nof contract nurses and now threatens to deprive the residents of the service of a physical\ntherapist.  Furthermore, as discussed immediately below, various supplies shortages have\nresulted from the nonpayment.\nThe supplies shortages, whether the result of vendor nonpayment, slow procurement\nprocesses, or poor planning, are serious.  The Monitor reports that D.C. Village was temporarily\nwithout duoderm, a medication needed for the treatment of decubitus ulcers. D.C. Village was\nalso temporarily out of its normal supply of saline used to cleanse these ulcers and other wound\nand incision sites. Perhaps most alarmingly, the Monitor reports that the stock of some\ncategories of perishable food was once reduced to a one-day supply.\n1On several occasions, the proceedings in this case have been hampered by counsel for the\ndefendants' fectual and legal misrepresentations to this Court.  Though these problems do not form\nthe basis for the present finding of contempt, they concern the Court, regardless of whether they are\nintentional.  The difficulty has risen in discussions with respect to many topics, including the status\nof vendor payments, the legal requirements of the reporting of outplacements to the Ombudsman, the\nlegal requirements and factual status of the handling of the residents' personal needs allowances, and\nthe defendants' ability to produce a list of vendors.  Though some contemporaneous treatment of\nthese problems can be found in the transcripts of status hearings in this case, the Court will review\nthe matter more thoroughly if the communication problems continue.\n\nAs for the outplacement of residents with mental retardation, this process was supposed\nto be completed by October 31,1995.  The parties and monitor report that the outplacement\nprocess is still not near its conclusion.  The defendants have sought an extension until the end of\nJanuary 1996, but they admitted in court that the deadline may not be realistic. The requested\ndeadline seems to the Court to lead inevitably to further noncompliance.\nAs for the evaluation of residents with mental illness, the defendants have admitted that\nthey are uncertain how many residents fall into this category because D.C. Village lacks the\npsychiatric services necessary to evaluate residents.\nThe Court will suspend the imposition of sanctions designed to compel compliance until\nthe next status hearing.  The parties are advised, however, that the Court is more inclined to\nimpose custodial sanctions or to order the appointment of a special master or private\nadministrator to manage D.C. Village than to impose fines, should noncompliance continue.\nIt is ORDERED that the defendants shall comply with the following provisions.\nA.  Within seven days from the entry of this order, the defendants shall begin to provide\nthe plaintiff and the plaintiff-intervenor with biweekly reports detailing what steps they have\ntaken within the current biweekly period to reach compliance with §D of the July 6,1995 order.\nThe defendants shall continue te provide such sports uxi£ sH D.C. Village residents with mental\nretardation are appropriately discharged from the facility pursuant to the July 6,1995 order.  In\neach report, the defendants shall identify specifically any financial and/or licensure problems\nwhich constitute barriers to placement, and the steps the defendants shall take to eliminate such\nbarriers.  The deadline for the outplacement of all D.C. Village residents with mental retardation\nis extended to February 28, 1996.\n\nC. For as long as individuals with mental retardation continue to reside at D.C. Village,\nthe defendants shall ensure uninterrupted clinical services, habilitation, and other services to all\nsuch residents.\nII.  r*»Tn»ral P^rharae  and Outplacement Issues\nA.

This team shall provide such specialty\nconsultation services until the receiving facility staff is\nstabilized and their competency is demonstrated.\nB.  Within seven days from the entry of this Order,\nDefendants shall provide a medical assessment, conducted by an\nindependent physician, for D.C. Village residents Cynthia W.>\nCarla L., and Alvina B. to ensure that their respective medical\nneeds are adequately addressed.

I\nrespectfully refer the Court to my August 10, 1995 submission to the Court, urging the need for\ntimeliness of approval of the budget.

Fields, Ed.D., R.N.\nend.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATUS REPORT\nUnited States of America v. The District of Columbia, eL al\nCiv. No. 95-948 TFH, Re: D.C. Village Nursing Home\nSubmitted by:\nHarriet A. Fields, Ed.D., R.N.\nCourt Monitor\nDate:\nSeptember 5, 1995\nEach of the items in the Court Order interrelate to total quality care, quality of life, and\nresidents rights, and although the following will relate to the areas listed in the Court Order, it is\ndifficult  to separate from  a total picture of factors impinging on the residents of D.C. Village\nNursing Home (DCV).\nDecubitus Ulcers\nWithin the past several months treatment nurses have been implemented at DCV whose sole\nresponsibility is to treat decubitus ulcers. There are two treatment nurses for the day shift and two\nfor the evening shift.  On each shift one nurse has responsibility for Units 5A, 5B, 4A, 4B and the\nsecond treatment nurse has responsibility for Units 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B. This provides coverage for the\nentire facility.  On Thursday evening, August 31, the Court Monitor observed the treatment nurse\non Unit 2B treat a healing decubitus ulcer with proper sterile technique.\nThe treatment nurses on the evening shift are contract agency nurses, however, they are\npermanently assigned to DCV during the week, Monday through Friday.  At this point in time, it\nis unclear to the court monitor why these nurses are contract employees rather than DCV staff.\nBefore the implementation of the treatment nurses, skin care was the responsibility of the\nlicensed nurses on each shift on each unit, which is appropriate for professional nursing practice.\nInterviews on August 31 with licenses nurses on the evening shift elicited comments that decubitus\nulcers are decreasing, skin care has improved.  Apparently, skin care was not a routine part of\nlicensed nursing practice at DCV before the implementation of the treatment nurses.\nFurther Court Monitoring activities\nUpon approval of the budget and availability of funds on a monthly basis: (1) resources will\nbe brought in to assess on an ongoing basis all residents skin condition, chart reviews, round with\ntreatment  nurses, and interview staff  and residents; (2) determine  and assess decubitus ulcer\ntreatment and skin care procedures on the weekend shifts when the treatment nurses are off; (3)\n&ssess role of inservice in education and training of all nursing personnel - certified  nurse aides\nCNA's, licensed nursing staff, and medical staff, on routine skin care and decubitus ulcer care\nprevention on an ongoing basis. This activity is not to imply that the use of treatment nurses is not\nappropriate in this situation.\n\nPayment of Vendors\nOne agency that supplies the majority of contract nurses for DCV stopped services from\nAugust 21 to August 31,1995 for lack of payment beyond the 45 days stipulated in the Court Order.\nOn August  29, the\" Court  Monitor  requested  of  D.C. Government  a  list  of vendors,\npayments, and outstanding payments.  To date, this information has not been received.\nReview of 30 Day Compliance Report\nUpon approval by the Court of the Court Monitor budget and availability of funds on a\nmonthly basis, a thorough assessment of accuracy of compliance report can be commenced.\nNurse Staffing\nThe Nurse Staffing chart in the 30 Day Compliance Report is not accurate. At no time are\nthere seven CNA (certified nurse aides) on the day or evening shifts.  On review of nurse staffing\nschedules in the nursing office, three CNA's are listed for day and evening shifts on most units.\nEach unit develops there own staffing schedule and submits it to the nursing office.  As of August\n31, only one unit has a staffing schedule submitted 90 days in advance.\nOn direct observation on each of the units on the evening shift of Thursday, August 31,\nthere were three CNA's on all units except Unit 2B where there were four CNA's and Unit 5A\nwhere there were two CNA's.\nContract Nursine Staff\nThere are at least six to eight different contract agencies supplying staff to DCV.  Many of\nthe nurses are regularly assigned to DCV, however, not to the same units, which does not help\nafford continuity of care.\nFurther Court Monitoring Activities\nDetermine appropriate number of staff necessary to provide resident care. It may very well\nbe that seven CNA's listed in staffing schedule in the 30 Day Compliance Report are not necessary\nto provide for quality care to residents as stipulated in the Court Order, and instead, what is needed\nis ongoing inservice education and training of existing levels of staff.  It is also unclear at this point\nin time, whether DCV has been reimbursed by the federal government for the increased  staffing\nlevels listed on paper but which are an inflation of actual staffing levels.\nAdditional Concerns\nAt this point in time, the Court Monitor has been able to determine that there are a number\n\nof conditions that are not listed in the Court Order, but directly relate to it and the ability of the\nstaff to comply with the Court Order.  These conditions are the following:\n(1) The announced closure of D.C. Village Nursing Home made in August 1995, by the\nDistrict of Columbia City Council and the Mayor;\n(2) D.C. Office of Personnel policies that delay hiring of personnel on a timely basis and\nretaining personnel;\n(3) Current Union policies relating to weekend coverage;\n(4) Medical care coverage\n(a) payment for\n(b) knowledge level of current minimum standards of practice as identified in the\nNursing Home Reform Law of 1987 and current regulations;\n(5) Most recent Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Survey Report of July 1995.\n(1)  Announced closure of DCV\nThis decision was announced in July-August of 1995, by D.C. Government officials with\napparently little or no input from DCV residents, families, staff.  According to the press, closure\nof  DCV  will  help  eliminate  approximately  440  of  the  2000  D.C.  Government  positions\nrecommended to be cut by the D.C. Financial Control Board.  However, according to a resource\nplan for personnel, staff who elect to remain D.C. employees and not take early retirement if they\nqualify are to be placed elsewhere in D.C. government, thus not eliminating positions.\nThe direct impact this closure announcement is having on the Court Order is that staff are\nresigning in understandable concern for their job security which adds to further use of contract staff\nand lack of continuity of care.\nThe primary impact of closing of DCV will be felt by the residents, some of who have lived\nat DCV for several years.  There is a considerable body of literature on \"transfer trauma\".  This is\na situation whereby a significant proportion of institutionalized residents when relocated die within\nsix months. Apparently this was even evident at DCV when Units 1A and IB were closed and long\ntime residents transferred to other units. Institutionalized elderly often 'give up their spirits' when\nfamiliar  surroundings, people, and routines are altered  and/or  taken from them, beyond their\ncontroL  The administrator estimates that at least ten percent of the current residents of DCV will\nbe among the transfer trauma death statistics. This directly relates to the Court Order in the areas\nof decubitus ulcers and nutrition.  Depression leads to inadequate nutrition which is conducive to\nthe development of decubitus ulcers.\nThe Residents' Council is opposed to closure of DCV and has apparently recently sent a\nletter to the D.C. City Council.\n(2)  D.C. Government Personnel Policies\nD.C. Government personnel policies are apparently impeding hiring in a timely manner\nneeded  replacement staff.  For example, the Director of Quality Assurance term limit expired\nAugust 1, 1995. As of August 31, the position has not been reinstated.  This Director of Quality\nAssurance has not been paid since August 1 and as of August 31 cannot continue service unless\n\nreimbursed.\nThe multi-week delay in hiring personnel contributes to the heavy use of contract personnel.\nIn telephone conversations with the Assistant Director of Personnel for the District of Columbia,\nMr. Louis Norman, on August 30, the Court Monitor was told that there is an expedited  hiring\nprocess in effect for DCV, the Director of Quality Assurance situation is an exception and \"methods\nare being processed to remedy it.\" The Court Monitor is awaiting data from Mr. Norman on the\nnumber of qualified personnel who will be expedited to DCV, when this will occur, and the status\nof the Director of Quality Assurance employment.\n(3) Current Union Policies Relating to Weekend Coverage\nLocal 2092 of AFSCME represents the nurse aides and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN)\nat DCV. Contract agencies do not supply the nurse aides. Current union policies provide for every\nweekend  off.  This is not sufficient  to cover the facility  seven days a week,  however  further\nassessment must be done.  Most facilities provide for every third weekend off.  The Court Monitor\nmet with the president of the local DCV employees union who was to present this situation to DCV\nmember staff on August 31. The Court Monitor is awaiting outcome on a union compromise\nthis working condition of their contract.\n(4) Medical care coverage\n(a) payment for:\nMedical staff coverage at DCV apparently is being paid directly by the D.C. Government,\nwhereas, it can apparently be appropriately billed under Medicare Part B, which apparently involves\na simple means of applying for it.  Thus, approximately one half million dollars a year in medical\ndoctor salaries is unnecessarily being borne by the District of Columbia Government. At this point\nin time, it is unclear to the Court Monitor why this situation exists.\n(b) knowledge level of current minimum standards of practice as identified in the Nursing\nHome Reform Law of 1987 and current regulations:\nOn cursory assessment, more of which will be done, it appears that medical staff, as well as\nnursing staff, are not knowledgeable of the minimum standards of practice for nursing facility\nresidents as reflected in the Nursing Home Reform Law and current federal regulations.  This is\nreflected in M.D. \"requests\" (orders) for decubitus ulcer treatment, physical and chemical restraints,\nparenteral nutrition.  All these areas are directly related to the Court Order.\n(5) Most recent Health Care Financing Administration THCFA^ Survey Report of Julv 1995\nFour Level A violations were found. According to federal regulations, Level A deficiencies\nwarrant the following:\n(a) a re-survey within 90 days of the last, by October 12, 1995;\n(b) DCV is to submit a Plan of Corrections;\nIf HCFA  determines  upon re-survey that DCV is still out of compliance with  federal\nregulations and the plan of corrections is not acceptable, proceedings could be instituted which\nwould result in:\n\n(a)  termination  of federal  portion  of reimbursement  as of October  1 which would be\napproximately $1.4 million dollars a month;\n(b) staff would not be reimbursed as of October 1;\n(c) DCV would be closed by October 31, 1995 leaving the residents without care and\nplacement.\nThis scenario, if implemented directly relates to compliance with the Court Order.\nAdditional Initial Overall Assessment\nThe  Court  Monitor  has met with  the evening  staff  and night  staff,  the day nursing\nsupervisory staff, administration, majority of the medical staff, and all the department heads.\nI have found  them all to be dedicated and committed and concerned for the welfare of DCV\nresidents.  Much further assessments are needed.  Education and training are needed immediately\non the minimum standards of practice for nursing home residents as reflected in federal regulations\nand the areas in the Stipulated Court Order.",

R.N.\n#604\n1722 19th Street, N.W.\nWashington, DC 20009\nMessage: (202) 234-7142\nDecember 10,1995\nThe Honorable Thomas F. Hogan\nU.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Avenue, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC  20001\nRe:  Court Order The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et al.,\nCiv. No. 95-948, TFH, D.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV);\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6,1995\nDear Judge Hogan:\nI am writing the Court now, before the next Status Hearing in January, because of four areas\nof concern which must be addressed immediately.  I am also in this letter to the Court,\nrecommending further data gathering and remedies to rectify what I have now identified as\npatterns detrimental to residents well-being.\nThe four areas I will address are the following:  (1) update on Mr. L.R. profiled in my\nDecember 6, 1995, letter to the Court; (2) the process of procuring  purchase orders for\nvendor  services, whereby there is now no stock of  normal saline used as a treatment\nmodality for decubitus ulcers; (3) chronic non-compliance of payment of vendors, whereby\nthere is now no duoderm  in house for treatment of decubitus ulcers and no payment to\nNational Nurses profiled in the Court Monitor's December 6, 1995, letter to the Court; (4)\nresidents' being denied their own funds from their Personal Needs Allowance (PNA).\nEach of these four areas are indicative to me of a common thread of similar patterns.  These\npatterns  are what I believe to be a misuse of government funds,  passivity and lack of\nadvocacy on the part of staff for residents' needs and the acceptance of the bureaucratic\ninertia described in the Court Monitor's October Status Report under C. Payment of Vendors\n(p.  22),  and needless  and unconscionable  delays in issuing purchase  orders  from  the\nProcurement Office of the Department of Human Services, District of Columbia.\nA description of these patterns in action is profiled in the Court Monitor's November Status\n\nDEC-10-95  SUN  22:22  NCCNHR  FAX  NO,  2023322949  P. 03\nReport under EL Stipulated Court Order. July 6, 1995, B. Measures to Remedy Shortages.\n1. Food and Drink (pp. 29-31.)\nHowever, I want to assure the Court, there are some staff who are true advocates  for\nresidents rights.  The two Associate Directors of Nursing (ADONs) are  implementing\nproactive  steps  to  improve  the  standard  of  practice  and  care  and  are  also  openly,\nconstructively, and professionally implementing the Court Monitor's recommendations.\nEach of the four areas listed above will be profiled.  At the end of the profiles will be\nrecommendations  and remedies needed to rectify  the patterns reflected  in all the areas\nprofiled.\n(1) Update on Mr. L.R. profiled in December 6. 1995 letter to the Court.\nOn December 8,1995, Mr. L.R. was out of bed and up in his wheelchair and resumed\nhis usual place at the entrance to DCV, where there is day light, activity, and other human\ncontact  Mr. L.R.S situation reveals a pattern of passivity on the part of the staff and also a\nnon payment of vendor problem.\nThe internal problem revealed by this resident scenario is the following.  To be sure, the\nnursing staff did contact physical therapy when Mr. LJL's wheelchair first broke.  However,\na systems failure set in whereby no one rectified the problem  until the Court Monitor was\nnotified by the ombuds person and the President of the Residents' Council, immediately\nstepped in  and called the physical therapy department and the wheelchair repair vendor, and\nalerted the Court.  Daily rounds by nursing and administration would have uncovered this\nnegligence.\nThe external problem revealed by this scenario is that a previous repair  to Mr.  L.R.'s\nwheelchair has gone unpaid since April, 27th of this year and the vendor was unwilling to\nservice DCV again as a result of this neglect in payment.\nNot maintaining resident equipment is a violation of federal regulations and the Court\nOrders.\n(2) Process of Procuring Purchase Orders CP.O.) for Vendor Services\nLast week at the time of writing of the Court Monitor's November 30 Status Report\nto the Court, this problem was reflected in a shortage of food supplies to the residents.  This\nweek this problem is reflected in an inadequate supply on hand of treatment modalities for\ndecubitus ulcers, specifically, normal saline to cleanse the site and duoderm to apply to the\nwound.  (Duoderm will be discussed under vendor non-payment.)\n\nDEC-10-95  SUN  22:23  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 04\nFor about a week sterile water from treatment kits for other uses has been used to cleanse\nwounds.  Sterile water is an appropriate substitute, however, normal saline is preferred.\nNormal saline is an item that should be routinely on hand in any nursing facility, and is also\nnecessary for the sterile cleansing of other equipment, such as catheter and tracheostomy\ntubing.\nWhile making rounds with the treatment nurse on Thursday evening, December 7,1995, the\nCourt Monitor discovered there was no normal saline in-house.  On unit 4A, at Mr. C.F.'s\nbedside while dressing Mr. C.F.'s stage in decubitus ulcer on his left hip, the treatment nurse\ntold me mat they have been out of normal saline for about a week.  This reminded me of a\ncamping  expedition,  where  ingenuity  in  substituting  routine  supplies  saves  the  day.\nHowever, this is a human being with a gaping whole in his body.  At times DC V is operating\nlike an underdeveloped country, when in fact this is the nation's capital.\nOn October 10, 1995, DCV submitted a \"request for purchase order\" to the Procurement\nOffice, Department of Human Services, District of Columbia. Among the items listed on the\npurchase order were normal saline and duodena.  The request for purchase order was marked\n\"Urgent per Court Order.\"  Once purchase orders are sent from the Procurement Office and\nreceived by DCV, they are sent by DCV to the vendor for delivery of supplies.  If  the vendor\nhas been paid, supplies will be delivered.\nDCV received the requested purchase order on December 6,1995.  Prior to receipt of the\nP.O.,  the staff person from DCV submitting the \"request for purchase order\" called Ms.\nCheryl Perkins of the Procurement Office and stressed to her the urgent need for receipt of\nthe P.O. for care of the residents and that priority should be given to DCV which is under\na Court  Order.  Apparently, Ms. Perkins' response was that there are many District of\nColumbia agencies under Court Orders.  I believe the analogy the DCV staff person used is\na good one: \"Ms. Perkins needs to know that DCV cannot be run like a stationery store,\nwhere you run out of pens or something: residents lives are at stake.\"\nIn a nursing facility it is not always possible to anticipate needed supplies months in advance.\nFor example, the size of bandages needed will depend on whether a wound develops (which\nshould not be happening), the site, and the anatomy of the resident.\nAccording to staff and administration at DCV, receiving purchase orders in a timely fashion\nfrom the Procurement Office has been a chronic problem.  (Recommendations to the Court\nare at the end of the profiles section.)\nLack of adequate supplies for resident treatment and care is a violation of federal regulations\nand the Court Orders.\n\n22:23  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949  P. 05\n)f Payment of Vendors\nAs of Saturday, December 9, 1995, DCV is out of supply of one treatment modality\nfor decubitus ulcers, duoderm.  Treatment nurses are using a substitute which they believe\nis not quite as effective.  One treatment nurse does have a limited supply of duoderm only\nbecause, through her wisdom and experience, she secreted supplies anticipating this scenario.\nThere is no duoderm, although I am informed emergency supplies are on the way, because\nDistrict  Healthcare,  the  vendor,  has  not  been  paid.  District  Healthcare  is  owed\napproximately $42,000.\nUpdate on National Nurses. Inc.. profiled in December 6, 1995, letter to the Court:\nOn Thursday evening, December 7,1995, Mr. Ronald Messenheimer, President of National\nNurses, Inc., left a message for the Court Monitor, that he had received \"confirmation from\nthe Chief Financial Officer's office (for the District of Columbia) that National will be payed\nin the next check run on Friday or Monday.  I will continue services pending receipt of check\non Friday or Monday.\"\nOn Friday afternoon, December 8, 1995, Ms. Barbara Mann of the Corporation Counsel's\noffice  for the District of Columbia,  left  a message for the Court Monitor  concerning\nNational Nurses Inc., that \"we are not aware of any termination prior to the weekend or\nimmediately thereafter, it is our understanding a check will be delivered to them not later\nthan Thursday of next week.  We are covered for the weekend at DCV.\"  This information\nis in conflict with the information Mr. Messenheimer was told the day before from the Chief\nFinancial Officer's  office.\nThe Court Monitor will inform the Court on a regular basis. Within the past week, the Court\nMonitor has begun to notice shortages of staff, primarily of nurse aides.  Contract nurse\nstaffing vendors are supplying nurses. However, none of them have been paid. Most recently\nin a letter dated December 6,1995, to Mr. Vemon Hawkins, Director, Department of Human\nServices for the District of Columbia, CUP HealthCare Services has  indicated they will\nterminate services on Thursday, December  14, 1995.  CUP HealthCare Services is owed\n593,102.86, ($11,935.77 of which is from December 1994.)\nNurse aides are District of Columbia government employees, are unionized, and are opting\nto take annual leave before DCV closes and they loose their benefits.  Further monitoring is\nneeded to determine why there are not nurse aide replacements and where there may be a\npotential source. Apparently, through the Personnel Department of the District of Columbia,\nthere is difficulty  securing staff for a limited term employ.\nDCV receives one of the highest Medicaid reimbursement rates in the continental United\nStates, approximately $240 per resident per day.  This amounts to approximately $87,600\n\nDEC-10-95 SUN 22:24  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949  P. 06\nper resident per year.  When the Court Monitor first arrived at DCV on August 28,1995,\nthere were 270 residents.  That is a total reimbursement rate of approximately $24,000,000\nper year.  Approximately half of mis total is federal funds and approximately half is District\nfunds.  According to DCV administration, as mentioned in the Court Monitor's November\nStatus Report to the Court, DCV is funded through fiscal Year 1996. Where are these funds?\nThe same vendor non-payment problems profiled in the affidavits of June 1995, which led\nto the Stipulated Court Order of July 6, 1995, are the same problems today.  (Remedies\nneeded to rectify this situation are at the end of the profiles section.)\n(4)  Residents Denied Personal Needs Allowance (PNA)\nResidents are to receive their Personal Needs Allowance (PNA) on the first of each\nmonth.  As of today, the residents have not received their December funds, nor can anyone\ntell them when they will receive their money.  The residents have a Holiday shopping trip\nplanned for Friday, December 15, 1995.\nThe Personal Needs Allowance is residents' money and in the District of Columbia amounts\nto $70 per month.  The source of the PNA is two-fold.  One is for the \"categorically needy.*'\nThese are residents with no other source of income and who receive Supplemental Security\nIncome (SSI). This amounts to a federal minimum share of $35 per month and in the District\nof Columbia a matching share to equal the $70 per month.  (I believe the ratio in the District\nis federal contribution of $40 and the District of Columbia contribution of $30.)  The second\nsource of PNA is the \"medically needy.\"  That is residents with social security, disability,\nand  or  public  or private pensions.  From these  sources of income,  $70 per month  is\nwithdrawn and to be put into the residents PNA  The remainder of these sources of income\ncontribute to the residents Medicaid reimbursement rate.\nIn an interview with the teller at DCV on Friday, December 8, 1995, the teller told me that\nhe has not received money in two and a half months, what he has been using to give to\nresidents as their PNA is money remaining in the fiscal budget (I believe last year's.), and\nthat he normally receives funds every week to two weeks.  The teller also told the Court\nMonitor that the PNA is from the District of Columbia Treasury.\nIt is a violation of federal law and regulations to co-mingle resident funds with anv other\naccount.  Resident funds in excess of $50 are required by federal regulations to be in an\n\"interest bearing account (or accounts) that is separate from any of the facility's operating\naccounts, and that credits all interest eamed on resident's funds to that account.\" [42 CFR\nPart 483.10 © (1) through (7)].\nJudge Hogan, I cannot tell you how sad and pitiful it is to see the residents hovering around\n5\n\nDEC-10-95 SUN 22:25  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949  P. 07\nthe window of the teller, across the hallway from the administration offices.  There is a\nsteady stream of residents throughout the day. The residents have not reached the justifiable\nanger stage yet, although some are close to it  In their eyes you can see that they are stunned,\nbewildered, and hurt  On Thursday, December 7 the staff was paid.  The residents are\nacutely aware of this and the fact, that there is no money to pay them their own funds.\nThe residents have so little in life, it is their dignity that is being robbed from them as well\nas their money.  Being deprived of their PNA adds to the stress of the impending loss of their\nhomes, and the stress of institutionalization at the Holiday season.\nRecommendations and Immediate Remedies Needed\nI believe all the above situations will continue unless the recommendations and remedies mat\nfollow are immediately put in place.  As DCV continues to approach closing, I can foresee\noperations unraveling, as it has already begun to do so in the areas profiled above: nurse\nstaffing, dressings for the treatment of decubitus ulcers, wheelchair repairs, and the residents'\nPersonal Needs Allowance.  I foresee the non-payment of vendors becoming out of control.\nI believe the primary issue is the misuse of and lack of accountability for government funds\nearmarked for the operations of D.C. Village Nursing Home and for the direct care of the\nresidents of D.C. Village Nursing Home - the most vulnerable and frail of the District of\nColumbia population.  Non-payment of vendors is symptomatic of this larger issue and is\nmanifested  in the culture of tolerance for and acceptance of bureaucratic inertia.  The\nbehaviors surrounding this culture are manifested internally at DCV by the acceptance of and\ntolerance for lack of supplies for basic humane care, and externally among DCV government\nofficials,  by the tolerance and acceptance of needless delays in the procurement process.\nTherefore,  in order to prevent the further  dissolution of residents' rights the  following\nimmediate remedies are needed:  (These remedies are not to supplant my recommendations\nin my Status Reports to the Court, the remedies identified here specifically relate to the\nconcerns identified in this letter.)\n(1)  An independent audit  under the Court's auspices, of the government  funds\nearmarked for DCV.  (For over a month now the Court Monitor has requested the Budget\nand Annual Costs Reports of DCV, most recently in the November Status Report.):\n(2)  Since there are dedicated federal and District matching funds earmarked solely\nfor the operations and direct care of the residents at DCV, there is no need for requests for\npurchase orders to enter the bureaucratic maze of the D. C. Government process.  And since\nDCV has a scheduled closing date of the end of March, 1995, all requests for  necessary\npurchase orders will be filled within a two week turn around:\n\nDEC-10-95  SUN 22:25  NCCNHR  FAX NO.  2023322949  P.08\n(3)  An accounting of Resident Personal Funds:\n(4)  Establishment immediately of a separate account for residents* personal funds\nincluding the residents' Personal Needs Allowance.\nJudge Hogan, I look forward to serving the Court in monitoring the implementation of these\nrecommendations  and immediate remedies needed for the best interests of the residents of\nD.C. Village Nursing Home.\nSincerely,\nHarriet A. Fields, Ed.D., R.N.\nCourt Monitor\ncc:  Mr. Richard J. Farano\nMr. David Deutsch\nCivil Rights Division\nU.S. Department of Justice\nP.O.

      "text": "HARRIET A. FIELDS, Ed.D., R.N.\n#604\n1722 19th Street, N.W.\nWashington, DC  20009\nMessage: (202) 234-7142\nU.S. v. District of Columbia\nThe Honorable  Thomas  F. Hogan  NH-DC-001-012\nU.S. District  Court  Judge\nU.S. District  Court  for the District  of Columbia\n333 Constitution  Avenue,  Nw, 4th Floor\nWashington,  DC  20001\nRe:  Stipulated  Order  entered  on July 6, 1995, in the  matter  United  States  v. District  of\nColumbia,  et al..Civ. No. 95-948.\nDear  Judge  Hogan:\nThe following is an initial estimated  budget  for the monitoring  activities  for D.C. Village.\nThese  figures  were  derived  after  much  thought,  consultation,  and  careful  consideration.\nThroughout,  I tried  to tailor the budget  to include only those items that are essential  to enable  me\nto effectively  monitor  the terms of the Stipulated  Order.  In arriving at the reimbursement  rates and\nthe budget  as a whole, I took pains to consult with local colleagues  who do similar work to ensure\nthat the quoted  hourly and other rates were reasonable.  Because  this case  involves a public facility,\nI have endeavored  to begin negotiating  rates less than the market  rates for required  consultants  and\nmyself and those figures are reflected  in the proposed  budget.  Further,  my initial investigation  and\nreview of the Court papers  leads me to conclude that lower time commitments  than reflected  in this\nbudget  would jeopardize  the abilities  of the Monitor  to comply with the Court  Order  or report  on\nthe needs  of the over 270 residents  of the D.C. Village nursing  facility.\nGiven  the  size of the task  ahead  of me, I have devoted  a substantial  amount  of time  thus  far  in\nidentifying  and developing  a local network  of expert  consultants  to draw upon  on an ad hoc basis\nas I deem  it necessary  in monitoring  the Order.  When at all possible monitoring  activities will build\non  local  expert  consultants  who  have  a  commitment  to  the  District  of  Columbia  and  to  the\nimprovement  of the quality of care and quality of life of its long term care residents.  (It will also\nkeep  expenses  for  consultants  to a minimum.)  I am  gratified  to report  that  I have  received  an\noverwhelming  positive and heartwarming  response  from  local professionals  with expertise  in such\nareas  decubitus  ulcer  care, care  of incontinent  residents,  medication  administration,  staffing  and\nbasic care  issues.\nGiven that  there  is no fixed termination  date  in the Stipulated  Order,  I have simply estimated  the\nbudget  for  a one  year  period,  although  I believe  monitoring  activities  will take  longer.  I  have\nestimated  that  monitoring  activities  in the  first  year  will involve a commitment  of up to three-\nfourths  of  my time.  This  includes  on-site  reviews,  review  of  documents,  writing  reports,  and\nTT\n\nconsultation  with experts,  all to  help  ensure  compliance  with the  Order.  This  estimate  will be\nreassessed  after  six months.\nCertain  deadlines  in the Stipulated  Order  which directly relate  to residents'  quality of care, quality\nof life and residents'  rights are imminent  or have already passed.  Therefore,  I respectfully  request\nconsideration  by the  Court  of  the  enclosed  at  your  earliest  possible  convenience  so  that  the\nresources  reflected  in the budget  may be employed  as soon as possible.\nSo that monitoring  activities can be continually  and consistently delivered, I respectfully  request  the\nCourt  to ensure  that  the  District  of Columbia  pay into a Court  escrow account  immediately  and\nmonthly a sum to be maintained  at $50,000.1 request  that the Court created  escrow account  in turn\npay to the Monitor  upon invoicing within seven days for monitoring  related  services and expenses.\nI will submit  my first invoice  for  work already  performed  upon  approval  of the  budget  and  for\nsubsequent  work at the end of every month.

District of Columbia\nii\nWashington, DC  NH-DC-OOI-014\n«\"-\nDear Judge  Hogan:\nRe:  Civ. No. 95-948 TFH, D.C. Village Nursing  Home\nI am writing you to inform you of two situations relating\nto my Court monitoring  activities.\nThe first is as of today at 1:00pm, I have not received\nthe Court ordered payment of Friday, September 15, 1995.\nThe  second  area  is that  I support  the United  States\nmotion  to  expand  the duties  of the Court  Monitor  to\ninclude the transfer and outplacement of residents.  This\nwould  include,  among  other  activities,  attending\noutplacement  meetings  and monitoring  individual  care\nplans,  placement  of  residents,  and  ability  of  the\nproposed  facilities to meet the needs and care for the\nD.C. Village  (DCV) residents.\nSome  of my concerns  with  transfer and outplacement of\nresidents are the following.\n(1)  Transfer  trauma  mentioned  in  my  Preliminary\nStatus Report.\n(2) At  least  four  of the facilities  which  have  a\npolicy  of  receiving  District  of  Columbia  medicaid\npayments  for  residents  and  are  listed  as  possible\ntransfer  and  outplacement  sites  are according  to my\nconsultants  \"substandard\"  to care  given  at DCV.  For\nexample, one nursing facility has an activities staff of\ntwo for a resident  population of 250.  According  to my\nconsultants, the staff morale in these facilities is low,\nthe staff is not generally spirited and motivated to care\nfor  residents,  the  opposite  of  what  I  am  generally\nfinding at DCV;\n(3) In a meeting  on Monday  morning,  September 18,\n1995,  with  Dr. Harvey  Sloane,  Commissioner  of  Public\nHealth,  and  other  District  of  Columbia  government\n\nSEP 21 '95  02:59PM DC VILLAGE  -  P.3\nofficials  as well  as  D.C. Village  administration,  I\nraised some of my concerns listed above as well as my\nserious concerns about one in particular outplacement\nfacility.  Although, I need further in-depth assessments\nin this area, apparently many of the decubitus ulcers at\nDCV either originate at this hospital or further develop\nand multiply  while  DCV residents are admitted.  Dr.\nSloane suggested  that I visit this local hospital to\noversee the staff knowledge and competence in the area of\ncare of decubitus ulcers.\n(4) I have now attended three of the \"Outplacement\nMeetings  for Residents with Mental  Illness.\"  It  is\ngenerally agreed upon at these meetings, that there are\nnot  sufficient  nor  existent  at  present  appropriate\nplacements  for  these  residents  needs.  Careful  and\nsensitive oversight is necessary.  I believe the same\nsituation  maybe  true  for  the  residents  with  Mental\nRetardation, although further assessments are necessary.\nI  believe  a  formal  expansion  of  Court  Monitoring\nactivities to include the transfer and outplacement of\nDCV residents will facilitate my ability to monitor in\nthe best interests of the long term care residents of the\nDistrict of Columbia and make it clear to staff at all\nfacilities what my role is.\nAgain, Judge Hogan, I look forward to serving the Court\nand  working  with  all concerned  parties  for the best\ninterests of the long term care residents of the District\nof Columbia.\nSincerely,\nHarriet A..

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice  of lh< r.; A::or-.; . Washington. D.C. 20530\nOCT BS4\nThe Honorable Sharon Pratt Kelly\nU.S. v. District of Columbia\nMayor of the District of Columbia\nOffice of the Mayor\nOne Judiciary Square\n441 4th Street, NW\nNH-DC-001-002\nWashington, DC  20001\nR: D.C. Village Nursing  Home\nDear Mayor Kelly:\nOn August 20, 1990, we notified the Mayor of the District of\nColumbia, the Corporation Counsel for; the District of Columbia,\n4\nand the Administrator of D.C. Village  (\"DCV\"), of our intention\nto investigate allegations of unconstitutional conditions at DCV\npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\n(\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et. sea.  In January 1991, we\ncompleted an investigative tour of the facility with two expert\nconsultants.  On August 19, 1991, we informed the then Mayor and\nother District officials that we had reasonable cause to believe\nthat persons residing in or confined to DCV were being subjected\nto conditions that deprived them of rights, privileges, and\niimmmmiuiTniiiti-iieosc  sceo^nrpn by the Constitution of tha United States.\nYounabera v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982).\nAttorneys from the District's Office of the Corporation\nCounsel, and the District's Department of Human Services\nindicated that remedial measures would be implemented at DCV to\ncorrect any constitutional deficiencies.  To ensure that the\nnecessary remedial action had been or would be undertaken, in\nApril 19 92, we conducted a follow-up investigation at DCV with\nfour expert consultants.  Unfortunately, we found that\nconstitutional deficiencies persisted at DCV.  On October 22,\n1992, we informed the Office of the Corporation Counsel that the\npersons residing in or confined to DCV continued to be subjected\nto conditions that deprived them of their constitutional rights.\nAgain, the District's counsel indicated that steps had been or\nwould be undertaken to correct any problems.\nOn April S, 1994, we notified the Office of the Corporation\nCounsel of our intention to conduct a follow-up investigative\ntour to assess current conditions at DCV.  On June 6-7, 1994, we\n\n.'  - 2\nconducted our tour of the facility accompanied by four expert\nconsultants:  Rebecca Elon, M.D., a geriatric physician, Blaine\nGreenwaid, M.D., a geriatric psychiatrist, Richard Amado, Ph.D.,\na psychologist, and Mary..Ellen Anderson, R.N.  Consistent with\nstatutory requirements, we are now writing to advise you of our\n-findings.  We regret to advise you that our investigative tour\nrevealed that the residents at DCV are continuing to be subjected\nto conditions that deprive them of their constitutional and\nstatutory rights.\nDCV is organized, staffed, funded and licensed as a nursing\nhome to care for elderly persons.  Nonetheless, the District has\ninappropriately placed at the facility a disparate group of\nindividuals including children, persons with mental illness, and\npersons with developmental disabilities, including mental\nretardation, simply because other parts of the District's care\nsystem lack available space and services to provide necessary\ncare.  Thus, the District has asked DCV to function as an acute\nand chronic care psychiatric treatment facility and as a\ndevelopmental center even though DCV is not equipped to provide\nthe specialized treatment and trainincr required for its mentally\nill and mentally retarded populations.\nAs a result, DCV is not meeting the needs of its residents.\nIn addition to providing inadequate care and services to its\nmentally ill and mentally retarded residents, DCV provides\ninadequate medical and nursing services to all its residents.\nDCV is unable to provide even adequate nursing home services to\nits geriatric population.  All this has produced a host of\nserious problems including needless suffering and risk of harm,\nan excessive number of hospitalizations, and an unusually large\nnumber of deaths due to aspiration.\nThe District must reorganize DCV to permit the facility to\nfulfill -its lawful purpose, i.e., to provide nursing home and\nrelated services to the elderly.  The District should place all\nchildren and individuals with mental illness or mental\nretardation in appropriate community based facilities and\nprograms.  Were these residents to be appropriately placed in\ncare facilities designed and staffed to meet their specialized\nneeds, the chances that they would receive appropriate training\nand treatment would be dramatically increased.  Nonetheless, to\nthe extent that mentally ill and mentally retarded  individuals\nare confined at DCV, the District is required to provide them\nwith adequate psychiatric care and/or training.  Younabera, 4 57\nU.S. 307; Preadmission Screening and Annual Review of Mentally\n111 and Mentally Retarded Individuals  (\"PASSAR\") 42 C.F.R.\n§ 483.100 et. sea.  (1994).\nAll residents of state operated institutional facilities,\nincluding nursing homes, have a fundamental Fourteenth Amendment\ndue process right to adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical\n\ncare, reasonably safe conditions, and training.  Younabera. 4 57\nU.S. 307.  As such, this right entitles residents to such care\nand training as to protect each residents' liberty interests and\npermit each resident an->.opportunity to function as independently\nas is reasonably possible.  Individuals with disabilities have a\nright to programs to teach adaptive behaviors, self-help skills,\ncommunication, social skills, and skills necessary to enhance\nindependence.  See, e.g.. United States v. Tennessee, No. 92-\n2062, slip. op.  (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 17, 1994); Thomas S. bv Brocks\nv. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178  (W.D.N.C. 1988}.  See also 42\nC.F.R. § 483.440  {Each institutionalized client is entitled :o a\ncontinuous and aggressive active treatment program that is\ndirected towards the \"acquisition of the behaviors necessary for\nthe client to function with as much self determination and\nindependence as possible.\").\nThe faces disclosed during the course of our investigation\nsupporting our findings of unlawful and unconstitutional\nconditions at DCV are set forth below.  •  • . -\nX.  MEDICAL CARS IS INADEQUATE.\nDCV is failing to ensure that DQV residents receive adequate\npreventive, chronic, routine, acute, and emergency medical care\nin accordance with generally accepted standards of care.\nThe most pressing medical concern at DCV is that the medical\nstaff routinely fails to assess and respond in a timely and\nappropriate fashion to individuals with aspiration pneumonia or\nrisk of aspiration, dysphagia or swallowing difficulties, and\ndecreased oral intake.  As a result of this inadequate care, many\nDCV residents have died.  A shockingly high number of DCV\nresidents have died due to some form of aspiration, pneumonia or\nfeeding dysfunction.  Since June 1/ 1992, at a minimum, 19\nindividuals are listed as having died at least in part due to\n\"aspiration\"; at least 18 others have died due to some form of\n\"pneumonia\"  {which could be related to aspiration).  Many of\nthese and other individuals have died in part because of a\n\"feeding dysfunction.\"  Many current DCV residents have beer.\nneedlessly subjected to prolonged suffering and discomfort\npunctuated by repeated hospitalizations merely because the\nmedical staff at DCV has been unable to adequately assess or\nrespond to the residents' aspiration risk or dysphagia.  The DCV\nstaff has failed and is failing to determine what specialized\nmedical services are required for these residents and to ensure\nthat such services are timely obtained whenever necessary.  The\nDCV primary physicians also fail to ensure adequate continuity of\ncare for these residents with outside hospitals when hospitalized\nand with outside medical consultants when furnished with a\nspecialty consult.\n\n- 4 -\nGenerally, the medical staff at DCV is failing to provide\nthe residents with adequate medical assessment, diagnosis,\ntreatment and monitoring of their conditions in keeping with\ngenerally accepted standards of medical care.  For example, DCV\nprimary care physicians fail to conduct comprehensive evaluations\nof all residents for whom\"they are responsible.  Even though a\nmedical treatment plan is urgently needed for each resident, DCV\nfails to provide each resident with an adequate, individualized\nmedical plan of care.  Our consultants could find no integraced\nmedical plan of care in any DCV resident's chart.  The medical\nstaff is also failing to respond to changes in an individual's\nmedical condition in a timely and appropriate fashion.  Finally,\nthe DCV medical staff inadequately monitors the effectiveness of\nmedications prescribed.  DCV medical records lack sufficient\ninformation to justify orders for medications or changes in\nmedication.  The absence of such data undermines the ability to\nevaluate the efficacy of medication treatment.  As a result,\nresidents may continue to receive medications that are not\neffective and do not resolve their medical condition.  This also\nunnecessarily exposes these individuals to the risks of\nmedication side effects.\nDCV is failing to provide adequate and appropriate routine,\nchronic, and emergency seizure management to all epileptic\nindividuals at DCV in accordance with accepted professional\nstandards of care.  Individuals prone to seizures need regular\nand periodic medical review of their condition and care.\nHowever, at DCV, there is grossly deficient medical practice in\nthis respect.  DCV fails to provide individuals with epilepsy\nwith a comprehensive neurological assessment of their condition;\nand there is no apparent neurology follow-up of residents with\nepilepsy either by a DCV physician or by an outside consultant\nneurologist.  As a result, it is not clear whether many DCV\nresidents still need to be taking anticonvulsant medication..\nDCV fails to provide adequate staffing to meet residents'\nmedical needs.  As we first indicated to you in our 1991 findings\nletter, DCV does not have the expertise, and is simply not\nequipped to provide the specialized medical care and treatment\nrequired for its mentally ill and mentally retarded populations.\nTo make matters worse, DCV fails to provide its medical staff\nwith needed staff development and continuing medical educational\nopportunities that would help enable them to meet these needs.\nOn our most recent visit, staff at the facility complained to us\nthat there were endemic staff shortages at DCV.  With respect to\nphysician staffing levels, for example, Dr. Allin, a psychiatrist\nat DCV, has been pressed into duty as a surrogate internist\nbecause of staff shortages.  Dr. Allin is trained as a\npsychiatrist, not as a primary care physician, so the individuals\nunder his care are not being afforded the needed services of a\ngeneral care medical doctor.  In addition, there is a trend at\nDCV to hire contract physicians who, at least initially, will be\n\n- 5 -\nlargely unfamiliar with the needs of the DCV residents they are\nto care for.  This is already a problem at DCV given the large\nnumber of contract/ agency nursing staff employed at the\nfacility.  In short, the, current DCV staff is quantitatively\ninadequate and qualitatively deficient to deal with the cornoiex\nmedical needs of the DCV population.\nDCV violates generally accepted practice by failing to\nmaintain adequate and appropriate medical records with proper\ndocumentation.  Interdisciplinary team notes in the individual\nresidents' charts are grossly inadequate; meaningful progress\nnotes are either absent or inadequate as physicians do not\nconsistently make notes in the individuals' charts when\nappropriate; and medical forms in the charts are not up-to-date\nand often have inexplicably not been updated for months or even\nyears.  In short, DCV lacks a recordkeeping system that is\nsufficient to provide accurate, relevant and timely information\nupon which professional decisions tnay be based regarding the\nnecessary care for residents.  As we first indicated in 1991,\ninadequate recordkeeping practices have compromised DCVs  ability\nto provide adequate care to its residents.\nThere are many other specific deficiencies in the provision\nof medical care and services at DCV including the DCV medical\nquality assurance system.  In this regard, the staff fails to\nensure that ordered services are actually rendered and that\nordered medications are actually given to residents.\nII.  NURSING CARE IS INADEQUATE.  '\nDCV is failing to ensure that its residents receive adequate\nnursing care, and that DCV nurses perform their responsibilities\nin keeping with accepted professional standards of care by\nadequately identifying health care problems, notifying physicians\nof health care problems, monitoring and intervening to ameliorate\nsuch problems, and keeping appropriate records of residents'\nhealth care status.\nOne of the most urgent problems at DCV is the facility's\nfailure to provide each individual with adequate and appropriate\nnutritional management in accordance with accepted standards of\ncare.  This failure has placed many DCV residents at risk of\naspirating which is an extremely dangerous, potentially\nlife-threatening situation.  DCV is failing to identify, assess\nand diagnose each individual who has a nutritional management\nproblem, including difficulty swallowing, chewing, or retaining,\nassimilating or eliminating food and/or liquids.  DCV is failing\nto ensure that residents are not fed improperly or while \"\nimproperly positioned in a wheelchair.  The DCV staff does not\nprovide adequate medical and nursing care services with respect\nto those individuals with dysphagia and other eating disorders.\nDCV has failed to develop screening indicators to identify\n\n\" .  - 6 -\nindividuals who are aspirating, are at risk of aspirating, and/or\nwho have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux.  DCV is failing to\nprovide comprehensive, interdisciplinary evaluations and\ndiagnoses for these individuals and is failing to identify\nmedical, dietary, feeding ar.d positioning needs of each such\nindividual.  Even for those individuals so identified, DCV fails\nto regularly monitor the progress of the DCV residents at risk of\naspirating ar.d to take whatever assessment, diagnostic,\ntreatment, or supervision steps are necessary to ameliorate the\nindividual's risk.\nThe nursing assessments at DCV are inadequate and are no: in\nkeeping with accepted professional practices.  DCV fails to\nconduct adequate comprehensive nursing assessments with quarceriy\nupdates of the nursing care needs of the DCV residents.  DCV also\nfails to develop and implement adequate and appropriate\ncomprehensive nursing care plans to address each resident's\nhealth care needs in accordance with accepted professional\npractices.  DCV also fails to develop and implement an\nappropriate nursing care plan to address any acute condition.\nMoreover, nursing staff should routinely monitor each\nindividual's current condition and review treatment needs.\nHowever, DCV fails to routinely perform on-going monitoring of\nserious medical conditions, and to undertake such basic\nprocedures as taking vital signs and monitoring other\nindividualized health status information.  For example, the DCV\nnursing staff routinely fails to monitor individual weights and\nrespond to individual nutritional needs in a timely fashion.  DCV\nneeds an adequate quality assurance system to ensure that proper\ncare and monitoring are being provided to the residents.\nThe current nursing staff is inadequate to meet the needs of\nthe DCV residents.  The clientele at DCV have very complex\nmedical and nursing needs with many individuals having unique\nbathing -and/or toileting needs.  Consequently, a sufficient\nnursing presence is crucial to their adequate care.  The existing\nnursing staff has been forced to operate in a perpetual  \"crisis\nmode.\"  As a result, nursing and medical care have greatly\nsuffered.  Nursing ratios must be increased generally to ensure\nthe provision of basic nursing care, adequate supervision and\ntherapeutic interaction for each resident.\nThere is currently a staffing problem given the widespread\nand common use of agency/contract nurses at DCV.  Current nursing\nvacancies are not being filled, and according to the DCV Director\nof Nursing, agency/contract nursing staff now approaches fifty\npercent of total shift coverage within the facility.  This is an\nextraordinarily high use of outside nurses and it is\nunacceptable.  Such widespread use of agency/contract nurses\npresents serious risks to the health and safety of the DCV\nresidents because the individual members of the contract staff\noften do not even know the names and identities of the residents\n\n•  _  7  _\n•  .  •\nto whom they are providing care and nursing services.  As such,\nthe current practice at DOT is neither clinically appropriate nor\na safe means of providing nursing care to the DCV residents.\nThe DCV nursing staff needs to be inserviced to ensure that:\n'\"• they have been provided with the appropriate training to care for\nthe diverse and challenging DCV population.  DCV nurses,\nespecially the contract nurses, are in urgent need of appropriate\ninservice training on the specialized needs of the DCV\npopulation, especially those with mental illness and those with\nmental retardation.  .. .\nThere are other nursing deficiencies at DCV.  For example,\nthere is evidence of an excessive number of medication errors at\nDCV.  The facility lacks adequate nursing protocols for certain\nproblematic yet recurring conditions among the DCV residents:\neating and swallowing disorders; non-ambulatory residents;\nresidents with seizure disorders; residents with serious\nbehavioral problems; residents with dementia and/or mental\nillness; residents with mental retardation; and residents prone\nto confusion, falling, bedwetting, etc.  Nursing care rendered to\nimmobile residents is inadequate.  At DCV, they are bathed only\nevery three days, they are provided w;Lth irregular and inadequate\nrange of motion exercises, and they are not turned frequently\nenough, thus exposing them to the risk of decubiti.  In addition,\nphysical management is insufficient to meet the residents' needs.\nThere are also a number of basic care deficiencies at DCV.\nFor example, the facility fails to provide adequate pest control\nthroughout the institution.  Our consultants frequently observed\nants at DCV on our most recent tour.  On some units, there was a\nfoul odor akin to a urine smell.  Finally, some residents\nexpressed concerns about missing and ill-fitting clothes, as well\nas unappetizing foods.  •\nIII. PSYCHIATRIC CARE IS INADEQUATE.\nThe District is failing to provide DCV residents with\nadequate and appropriate psychiatric care and mental health\nservices in accordance with accepted professional standards to\nresidents who need such services.\nDCV has an insufficient number of psychiatric staff to\nprovide adequate care and training to meet generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  In our 1991 letter, we notified you that\none of the most glaring personnel deficiencies was the shortage\nof staff with specialized training in the care and treatment of\nmental illness.  We indicated that the current DCV staff was\ninadequate to deal with the complex psychiatric and medical needs\nof the DCV population.  Unfortunately, this is still true today.\nEven the staff at the facility complained to us on our most\nrecent visit that there were endemic staff shortages at DCV and\n\n\"  -  8  -  -\"\"•  -\nthat this directly compromised the provision of psychiatric care\nand treatment.  A recent example of the negative impact of the\nstaffing shortage at DCV is the recent forced closure of Unit 3B\nwhich primarily served residents with mental illness.  The staff\nis largely unfamiliar with the residents' individual psychiatric\nneeds.  This is especially true of the contract/agency staff at\nDCV.  Because of the unavailability of trained and supervised\nprofessional and direct care staff, DCV both overuses and\ndangerously misuses chemical restraints on residents.\nA psychiatrist working at a facility like DCV should not be\nresponsible for the primary medical care of any resident.\nHowever, at DCV, Dr. Allin, a psychiatrist, has recently been\npressed into service as a surrogate internist because of staff\nshortages.  As a result, there is no qualified psychiatrist\nworking at DCV who is responsible solely for the coordination of\nmental health services at the facility.  Ever since Dr. Allin has\nbeen saddled with inappropriate primary care responsibilities,\nthere has been a marked decrease in the quality of psychiatric\ncare rendered at DCV.  Serving as a primary care physician has\nkept Dr. Allin from providing psychiatric services to any\nresidents outside of those on his caseload, and has greatly\nimpaired his ability to tend to the psychiatric needs of his own\npatients.  ' '  '•'\nIt is generally accepted that individuals with mental\nillness, like those at DCV, are to be provided with adequate\npsychiatric assessment, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of\ntheir condition.  Specifically, they are to be afforded an\ninitial comprehensive psychiatric assessment, a carefully\nconsidered psychiatric differential diagnosis based on DSM-IV\ncriteria and objective behavioral data, a psychiatric treatment\nplan that is integrated with the individual'^ medical plan of\ncare and with the individual's behavioral treatment programming,\nadequate psychiatric monitoring that includes quarterly updates\nof the psychiatric treatment plan, and at least a monthly\npsychotropic drug review to monitor drug efficacy, dosing and\nside effects.  However, DCV does not afford this to its\nresidents.\nDCV is not providing its residents with a comprehensive\npsychiatric assessment including adequate behavioral data and\nwith a functional analysis of the individual's behavior where\nappropriate.  DCV also conducts no cognitive examinations or\ndementia work-ups of its residents.  DCV is not providing its\nmentally ill residents with an integrated differential diagnosis\nand treatment plan which is signed by the psychiatrist.  It is\ngenerally accepted in the field that a proper DSM-IV diagnosis be\nformulated and recorded before any institutionalized resident is\nprovided psychotropic medication.  However, the DCV medical staff\nis not familiar with and does not appropriately employ the DSM-IV\ncriteria or terminology in formulating psychiatric diagnoses.\n\n:  •  -  9  -\nMany DCV residents have been placed on psychotropic medications\nwithout adequate documentation.  This violates generally accepted\npractice.\nWith respect to psychiatric treatment at DCV, there is no\neffort made to integrate psychiatric care for the residents in a\nmultidisciplinary fashion.  Psychiatric notes are not integrated\nwith the individual's overall medical plan of care or with\nbehavioral treatment programs.  Our consultant could not find a\nsingle integrated medical/ psychiatric/ psychosocial plan in any\nDCV resident's chart.  It is generally accepted that prior to-\nprescribing psychotropic medication for individuals with behavior\nproblems, a facility is to specify that alternative\nnon-pharmacological treatments have been systematically attempted\nand that they have been ineffective.  However, this is not done\nat DCV.  As we first indicated in our 1991 letter, DCV is failing\nto adequately integrate the use of psychotropic medication with\nbehavioral programming.  At DCV, there is no organized use of\npsychotropic medication in a carefully considered plan of care,\nand there is no rationale provided when medication dosages are\nchanged.  There is also no consistent correlation between\nmedication order changes and progress note documentation of such\nchanges.  All this does not comport with accepted standards in\nthe field.  As a result, integrated psychiatric treatment plans\nare urgently needed for the DCV residents to ensure that\nprogramming options are exhausted before medications are perhaps\nneedlessly employed.\nPsychotropic medications are often used incorrectly at DCV.\nFor example, medication dosing does not always conform to\ngsropsychiatric standards, dosing of antidepressants is\ninadequate or not properly titrated, depression is poorly\ndocumented  (if at all), and there is widespread usage of PRN\nmedication at DCV.  There are also many individuals with the\nmedication side effect of tardive dyskinesia (\"TD\") living at\nDCV.  Yet, anticholinergic medications are improperly prescribed\nfor TD, even though these agents will, in fact, worsen TD.  The\nDCV physicians are confusing TD and extrapyramidal symptoms.\nThis indicates a lack of basic neuro-chemical/ neuro-\npharmacological understanding among medical providers at DCV and\nhighlights the need for inservice training in psychopharmacology\nand geriatric psychopharmacology.  Our consultant concluded that\nthe DCV primary care doctors are not adequately trained in the\nfield of psychiatry. 1/\n]_/ DCV provides virtually no inservice training on mental health\nissues for its medical care staff, nursing staff or other direct\ncare staff.  As a result, psychiatric care at DCV has suffered on\nevery level.  A continuing education program in mental health\nissues and practices needs to be developed for the medical,\n{continued...}\n\n' •  '  -  io  -  .\nIt is generally accepted that the monitoring of an\nindividual's progress on a given psychiatric treatment should\ninclude the collection of appropriate objective and behavioral\ndata so as to ensure that the individual is receiving benefit\nfrom the treatment.  However, at DCV, the staff fails to collect\nand provide behavioral data to the physician or psychiatrist for\nevaluation of the particular treatment.  In fact, at DCV, there\nis no evidence of follow-up by the psychiatrist or primary care\nphysician regarding a resident's progress on a given psychiatric\ntreatment.  , .\nAs we first indicated in 1991, the facility's monitoring of\npsychoactive medications departs from accepted medical practice\nand fails to protect residents from serious risks of harm.\nBecause of the dearth of behavioral and other data collected at\nDCV, the physician or psychiatrist is limited in his ability to\ndetermine whether a particular medication regimen has been\nsuccessful or not, and whether it should be adjusted or\nwithdrawn.  This produces the risk of undue chemical restraint.\nPsychotropic medications used without continual justification by\nobjective, accurate, individualized behavioral data constitute\nrestraint for behavioral control purposes..  In addition,\nnecessary evaluations of medications are not made at DCV, nor is\n t\nthere evidence of attempts at \"drug holidays\" or at gradual\nreduction after extended usage at the same dosage.  Once DCV\nachieves stabilization of acute behavioral symptoms through\nmedication, the staff no longer provides dynamic treatment; the\ntreatment becomes static.\nIn addition, side effects of psychotropic medications are\ninadequately and improperly monitored at DCV.  Vie first notified\nyou in 1991 that DCV residents are not adequately monitored for\ndrug side effects.  For example, there currently is no regular\nreview of prescribed psychotropic medications to integrate side\neffects with symptoms; DCV does not take postural blood pressure\nratings on residents; and our consultant found that AIMS scores\nin residents' charts appeared to be perfunctory and did not\ncorrelate with his own observations.\nIV.  PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES ARE INADEQUATE.\nThe District is failing to provide the residents of DCV with\nthat level of minimally adequate individualized behavioral\nprogramming to ensure and protect the DCV residents' liberty\ninterests in personal safety and freedom from undue or\nunreasonable restraint.\ni/(...continued)\npsychiatric, nursing and other staff.  In addition, the pharmacy\ndepartment should be inserviced on geriatric psychopharmacology.\n\n- 11 -\nIndividuals living in an institution like DCV must be\nprotected from physical injury and psychological harm stemming\nfrom behavior problems.  An individualized behavioral treatment:\nprogram, devised and implemented according to currently accepted\nprofessional standards, can reduce and eliminate these\nma1adaptive behaviors.  However, the behavioral treatment\nprograms currently utilized at DCV substantially depart from\naccepted professional standards.  DCV fails to provide an\nadequate array of comprehensive individualized training programs\ndeveloped by qualified professionals consistent with accepted\nprofessional standards to reduce or eliminate risks to personal\nsafety, unreasonable use of bodily restraints, prevent\nregression, and facilitate the growth, development, and\nindependence of every DCV resident.  Our consultant psychologist\nfound that DCV residents are being subjected to harm and\nunreasonable risk of injury due to major deficiencies in the\nassessment of residents and in the development, implementation\nand monitoring of resident behavioral programs.  As a result, the\nDistrict is failing to provide reasonably safe conditions and to\nensure the reasonable safety and personal security of the DCV\nresi nts.\nAll behavioral programs must be^based upon an adequate\nassessment of resident need, including the need to develop\nprograms to address maladaptive behaviors.  DCV residents have\nevidenced quite a range of maladaptive behaviors, including\nself-injurious behavior, pica, including ingesting feces and\ndrinking from the toilet, and aggression.  At every stage of the .\nassessment, analysis and treatment of an individual's behavioral\nproblems, DCV is failing to meet accepted professional practices.\nThe inadequacies in the development and implementation of\nbehavioral programs at DCV have deprived the residents of\neffective treatment for their maladaptive behaviors and violated\ntheir rights.  '  .\nResidents demonstrating self-injurious, physically abusive\nor other destructive behaviors are not being provided appropriate\ntraining to reduce or eliminate such behaviors.  The limited\nbehavior programs that are provided are not data based and\nthereby fail to meet professional standards.  DCV lacks a\nfacility-wide behavioral observation system that is used by all\nstaff.  Absent appropriate data, DCV staff cannot evaluate\nwhether behavior programs are effective.\nThe District is engaging in the use of chemical restraints\nby failing to ensure that psychotropic medications are prescribed\nand administered to DCV residents in keeping with accepted\nprofessional standards, and are not used in lieu of treatment, or\nfor the convenience of staff.  For those dually diagnosed\nindividuals who need both behavioral programming and medication\nfor their mental illness, it is extremely important that the two\ntreatments are integrated properly.  Accurate and reliable\n\n- 12 -\nbehavioral data is particularly important when behavioral\nprograms are combined with pharmacological treatment.  In\naddition, written programs must show that the psychologist and\nphysician have discussed the probable consequences of the\ncombined treatments •  However, at DCV, the level of integration\nof behavioral and pharmacological interventions is minimal.  DCV\nfails to provide adequate behavioral programming for residents\ntaking psychotropic medication.  The programming that does exist,\nmoreover, is not integrated with the use of psychotropic\nmedication.  •..\nFor those individuals on psychotropic medication, it is\ngenerally accepted that the treatment monitoring process is to\ninvolve continual reevaluation of the individual's existing\nbehavior management program to determine whether it is\nappropriate and effective and whether the programs or\ninterventions need to be developed or modified to address the\nresident's target behaviors so as to reduce or eliminate the need\nfor psychotropic medication.  However, DCV employs inadequate\nprocedures for monitoring the effectiveness of behavioral\nprograms and/or medications prescribed.\nThe District is failing to ensure that DCV residents are\nfree from undue or unreasonable restraint,  DCV fails to provide\nprofessionally developed individualized training programs that\nare sufficient to ensure that residents are not subjected to\nunwarranted and unreasonable restraints.  For example, instead of\nprogramming, DCV routinely uses mitts to control the maladaptive\nbehaviors of certain residents.  The DCV staff consistently fails\nto identify and eliminate circumstances which provoke problematic\nbehaviors in residents, particularly those who are mentally\nretarded.  As a result, the staff intervention invariably focuses\non restraint to control maladaptive or aggressive behavior,\nwithout resort to other recognized therapy methods.  Physical and\nchemical restraints are both overused and dangerously misused by\nDCV staff on residents because of the lack of essential training\nprograms.\nNot all residents with behavior problems are being provided\nwith a comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluation to determine\nthe individual's need for training.  As mentioned, there is no\nadequate behavior data collection system in place at DCV.  For\nindividuals with problem behaviors, DCV is failing to provide\nthem with adequate functional analyses.\nThe District is also failing to provide DCV residents with\nthat level of individualized training necessary to enhance\nfunctioning, and facilitate growth, development, and\nindependence.  In the absence of such programs, residents do not\ndevelop the skills necessary to exercise any degree of\nindependence and they remain totally dependent on staff to meet\nall their needs.\nir\n\n- 13 -\nDCV residents' functional capabilities are deteriorating\nbecause of inadequate interaction, stimulation and treatment.\nOur consultants observed that the residents typically sit around\nall day with nothing to.-.po.  Often this occurs while individual\nstaff are in the room watching television.  As a result, training\nprograms at DCV are not implemented, revised or updated.  In\ntalking with staff on the units, it was not clear at all to our\nconsultant that the residents who were sucoosed to be gettincr\nprogramming were actually getting it.  Individual staff on the\nunits were, for the most part, completely unfamiliar with the\nindividuals' programming needs.  In fact, the programming books\nthat they are to use are located at a location far from the\nactual living units.  Further, the training programs as written,\nfocus on activities for the staff to do for the resident instead\nof for the resident to complete him or herself.  This does not\ncomport with generally accepted practices.  The communication\nprograms ir. place at DCV are inadequate in that they do not teach\nthe residents to express their needs and wants.  Activity\nprograms and level of staff interaction are not adequate to even\nensure maintenance of existing functional levels.  Currently,\nactivities of daily living and assistance with eating are\nconsidered activity therapy and are used to justify very limited\nprovision of occupational and physical therapy.\nWe noticed a recurring problem at DCV in that there was a\nshortage or absence of needed adaptive equipment.  For example,\nthe speech therapist regularly noted that adaptive spoons or\nadaptive cups were not available for use with the residents.\nEven though this occurred repeatedly, DCV took no steps to remedy\nor even reference the problem in a quarterly or monthly review.\nAs we indicated in 1991, inadequate recordkeeping practices\nhave compromised DCV's ability to provide behavioral treatment\nand training to its residents.  DCV lacks a recordkeeping system\nsufficient to provide accurate, relevant and timely behavioral\ndata upon which professional decisions may be based regarding the\nprogramming for its residents.  The absence of such data\nundermines the ability to assess an individual's progress on a\ngiven treatment plan and the interaction of drugs and behavioral\nintervention.\nDCV does not provide adequate psychology service hours to\nits residents.  As we indicated in 1991, the most glaring\npersonnel deficiency is the shortage of staff with specialized\ntraining.  The current DCV staff is inadequate to deal with the\ncomplex psychiatric and psychological needs of the DCV\npopulation.  Physical and chemical restraints are both overused\nand dangerously misused by DCV staff on residents because o£ the\nunavailability of trained and supervised professional and direct\ncare staff.\n\n-  14  -\nV.  FEDERAL  STATUTORY  VIOLATIONS\nBased upon our tours, we believe that the District is not in\nfull compliance with a -number of federal statutes and\nregulations.  For example, the District is not meeting the PASSAR\nrequirements pursuant to \"4 2 C.F.R. § 483.100 et sea.  (1994).  For\nthose mentally retarded and mentally ill individuals confined at\nDCV, the District must provide them with adequate and appropriate\nspecialized services.  Fcr those with mental illness, this\nincludes, for example, the continuous and aggressive\nimplementation of an individualized plan of care that, among\nother things, works toward reducing the resident's behavioral\nsymptoms and improving his or her level of independent\nfunctioning.  For those individuals with mental retardation, it\nentails, for example, the aggressive and consistent\nimplementation of a program'that works to enable the individual\nto acquire behaviors necessary for the individual to function\nwith as much self-determination and independence as possible.\nHowever, the District fails to adequately provide and implement\nthese services for its mentally ill and mentally retarded\nresidents confined at DCV.\nThe District is also failing to meet the requirements of the\n 4\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12101 et. sec.. and the regulations promulgated pursuant\nthereto; and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\n(\"Section 504\"-), 29 U.S.C. § 794 et, sea. , and the regulations\npromulgated pursuant thereto with respect to many individuals,\nespecially children and other individuals whose primary diagnosis\nis mental disability -- individuals with mental illness or\ndevelopmental disabilities.  DCV is an isolated, self-contained\nenvironment which necessarily separates its ^residents with\ndisabilities from the rest of society.  As a-result, the facility\nfails to provide its residents treatment in an environment that\npermits contacts with society and its mainstream social\ninstitutions, demands independent functioning and permits the\nexercise of judgment and contact with family members.  The\nDistrict must provide its residents with disabilities an\nopportunity to participate in or benefit from aids, benefits and\nservices equal to that afforded to others outside the\ninstitution; more specifically, to those provided to other\nindividuals with disabilities in the District's well established\ncommunity-based programs.  The residents are entitled to aids,\nbenefits and services that are as effective in affording them the\nequal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same\nbenefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as those\nserved in community-based programs.  By confining residents with\ndisabilities at DCV, the District is failing to provide such\nservices in the least separate, most integrated setting as\nrequired by the ADA and Section 504.\nmi\n\n- 15 -\nFurther, we are concerned that the District may not be\nproviding its school-aged residents with an appropriate education\nin accordance with the requirements of the Individuals with '\nDisabilities Education Act  {\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et sea.\nThe DCV children are not being served in the least restrictive\nenvironment.  Confined at -the facility, they are necessarily\ndenied adequate involvement and interaction with other school-\naged children contrary to the IDEA.\nIn addition to the above statutory and regulatory\nviolations, we note the many historical violations, cited by the\nHealth Care Financing Administration, of the Medical Assistance\nProgram  (Medicaid) established under Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r et se_g., and the regulations\npromulgated pursuant thereto, and of the Health Insurance Program\nfor the Aged and Disabled  (Medicare) established under Title\nXVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395i et sea., and\nthe regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.\nVI.  MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to the remedial measures specified in our letter\ndated August 19, 1991, the following^additional measures, at a\nminimum, need to be implemented at DCV in order to protect the\nrights of residents and other individuals with disabilities\ncurrently confined there.\n1.  Facility Reorganization\na.  Steps must be taken to ensure that the facility is\noperated as a nursing home consistent with currently accepted\nprofessional standards of care by, inter alia, placing all\ninappropriately placed1individuals, i.e., children and other\nindividuals with a primary diagnosis of mental illness or mental\nretardation, in appropriate community based programs and\nfacilities.

Village Nursing Home L\nSubmitted by:\nHarriet A. Fields, Ed.D., R.N.\nCourt Monitor\nDate:\nOctober 16, 1995\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nHundreds  of  hours of the Court Monitor and consultants time have been  devoted to\nassessing D.C. Village (DCV) and developing and helping  implement a tracking system so\nmat compliance with the Court Order could be measured. The Court Monitor was appointed\nby the Court on August 1,1995.  The budget for monitoring activities was approved by the\nCourt on September 6, 1995.  The Court Mom'tor and the nursing home systems expert\nconsultant first entered DCV on August 28, 1995.  At that time it was apparent mat there\nwere no clear systems in place to determine compliance with the Court Order or other\nindicators  of  quality  of  care.  Therefore,  a  systematic  assessment  was  immediately\nimplemented.  This assessment consisted of meeting with all department heads and as many\nstaff as possible and continuous touring of the units where DCV residents live.  The Court\nMonitor met with all department heads as a group and then met with each department and\nstaff  separately,  hi order to report to the Court regularly and accurately on compliance with\nthe Court Order, systems assessment of DCV is ongoing as well as touring the units on all\nthree shifts, day, evening, and night.\nThe  Court  Monitor  met  with  the  following  DCV  departments:  therapeutic  activities,\n\nnutrition/dietary, nursing, medicine, pharmacy, housekeeping, facility services, physical\ntherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy,  social service, administration.  The purpose\nof these meetings was to clarify the role of the court monitor, the content of the Court Order,\nthe role of each individual department in complying with the Court Order, the integral\nrelationship of the Court Order to the quality of care and the quality of life of the residents\nof DCV, identify and clarify the tracking system to be implemented in order to monitor\nfacility  compliance with the Court Order, and to assess the role and function  of each\ndepartment in resident care. Along with the Executive Director of DCV, the Court Monitor\nmet with all nursing staff on all three shifts, day, evening, and night.\nOn numerous occasions at DCV, the Court Monitor has met with and toured the resident\nunits with the Commissioner of Public Health for the District of Columbia, the Interim\nAdministrator for Long Term Care for the District of Columbia as well as many other\nDistrict of Columbia government officials.  It is a tribute to the Court that the Monitor has\nbeen openly received and has been told by  the District of Columbia officials as well as the\nExecutive Director of DCV mat the Court Monitor's presence has been a positive influence\nin helping to facilitate compliance with federal and District law and regulations and the Court\nOrder.  It is a privilege to serve the Court for the best interests of the residents of DCV.\nThis  Status Report not  only  serves to inform  the  Court  on a regular basis  regarding\ncompliance with the Court Order, but hopefully it will also serve as a guidepost for staff at\nDCV to facilitate improvement in care.  No one area in the Court Order can be separated\nfrom the entire life of the institution and from how residents receive care, therefore, in order\nto give the Court a picture of the systems within DCV, and the relationship to the Court\nOrder,  a systems overview follows.\nH.  OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nA.  Physical Restraints\nPerhaps the most profound impact the presence of the Court has had at DCV to date  is the\nreduction in the use of physical restraints.  The use of physical restraints directly relates to\nthe Court Order in the areas of pressure sores and incontinence by immobilizing residents\nand affording  no opportunity for turning of position and toileting.  The Nursing Home\nReform Law of 1987 stipulated that nursing home residents have a right to be free from\nphysical and chemical restraints.  This has had a profound  impact on long term care in this\ncountry, so much so that now the acute care settings are looking to nursing homes for\nguidance in \"untying the elderly\".  When the Court Monitor and consultant first entered\nDCV at the end of August, there were 59 physical restraints in use at DCV, approximately\n25 percent of the resident population, well above the national norm.  At present, there are\nless than 10 physical restraints in use.\nHopefully the process implemented to reduce physical restraints will be utilized to improve\nother  care  areas, especially  those  identified  in the  Court  Order.  The process  is  the\ninterdisciplinary care approach utilizing all systems or departments, for one goal of quality\nresident care.  The newly hired physical therapists as well as the occupational therapists\nworking with facility services, housekeeping, nursing, medicine, therapeutic activities along\nwith the resident as a team achieved this result.\nB.  Dining\nAnother  impact the presence  of the Court has had at DCV is the engagement  of the\ntherapeutic activities department in the residents dining experience.  Most of the resident\ndining areas on the units now have table clothes, flowers on the tables, and tables separated\nmuch as in a restaurant style.  This can have the potential to add to residents improved\nnutrition by making dining more of a home event than an institutional routine.\nTT\n\nC.  Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA^ Survey\nAs mentioned in my Preliminary Status Report to the Court, HCFA did return at the end of\nSeptember to re-survey DCV.  The surveyor's findings were that there were no level A\ndeficiencies  outstanding and, therefore, the intent to close and terminate federal funding\nwere set aside.  Two deficiencies were cited in care planning and pest control.  At the exit\nconference, Dr. Harvey Sloane, Commissioner of Public Health for the District of Columbia\nacknowledged among others,  the positive role of the Court Monitor and consultants in\nadvising the facility on how to comply with federal regulations.\nDCV must focus on an interdisciplinary systems approach to improve resident care as\nreflected in compliance with the Court Order.  When the Court Monitor and  nursing home\nsystems expert consultant first entered DCV, the care plans and care planning process in\nplace did not meet the minimum standards of care requirements reflected in the federal\nregulations. Part of the tracking system implemented to monitor compliance with the Court\nOrder is a new care planning system which merely reflects the federal regulations.\nPest control continues to be a problem at DCV.  According to outside, independent pest\ncontrol experts who know DCV and the District of Columbia government, roaches, etc., can\nbe eliminated or greatly reduced by utilizing a variety of products and proper application.\nD.  Physical Therapy. Occupational Therapy\nA recent and very positive force at DCV is the new physical therapists and occupational\ntherapists.  They are contract staff  but committed to DCV.  The physical therapists are\nconsummate professionals and can serve as a model to all other departments in their focus\non interdisciplinary approaches to resident care.\nThe remaining overview reflects a systems breakdown at DCV and is directly related to the\n\nability of DCV to comply with the Court Order. It is my sincere hope that recommendations\nwill be acted upon for the best interests of resident care.\nE.  Nursing\nIntensive in-service sessions on the tracking systems for assessing compliance with the Court\nOrder  and care planning have been given to the licensed nursing staff  by the Court\nMonitor's consultants.  In addition, follow-up advice has been given on the units.  These\nsessions merely reflect advice on how to comply with minimum standards of care as reflected\nin the federal regulations.  I find an admirable and unanimous commitment to learning how\nto improve resident care.  Nursing staff have come in on their days off and off shifts to\nattend. However, until two weeks ago with the hiring of a new Director of Nursing and an\nAssociate Director of Nursing,  there was no leadership from the nursing office.\nI am very hopeful that this new administrative team will bring the direction that is needed.\nBoth the new administrators are doctorally prepared.  The Director of Nursing is a seasoned\nadministrator from Howard University Hospital and the new Associate is a former Director\nof Nursing in a nursing home in the District and has a working knowledge of the minimum\nstandards of care as reflected in the federal regulations.  At the initiation of the new Director\nof Nursing (DoN), and commencing Thursday,  October 12,1995, weekly Thursday morning\nmeetings will take place between the DoN and the Court Monitor for the shared purpose of\nimproving resident care.\nPolicies and procedures must be updated, some are more than 20 years old.  On-going and\ndaily supervision from the nursing office of the unit clinical coordinators on all three shifts\nmust commence immediately.  The clinical coordinators on each of the eight care units are\nwell intentioned, caring but floundering with no direction from nursing administration.  Basic\ncare practices  are not part  of daily and routine resident  care which  is  a violation  of\n\nprofessional standards of practice. These absent routine care practices that directly relate to\nme Court Order are the following:  daily range of motion; re-positioning at least every two\nhours; daily skin checks of the entire body to prevent the development, spread and worsening\nof decubitus ulcers; hydration;  and restorative bowel and bladder programs for incontinent\nresidents.  The sections of this Status Report mat address the appropriate sections of the\nCourt  Order will provide  assessment  data.  I  am hopeful  that with the new  nursing\nadministration leadership, all future Status Reports to the Court will profile progress in these\ncare areas.\nF.  Staff Development\nStaff development at DCV is very weak.  There is currently one staff development person\nat DCV. The section of this Status Report addressing nurse staffing will address recent new\nstaff, one of  whom has been assigned, as of the week of October 9, 1995, to the Staff\nDevelopment department.  This new contract staff apparently is knowledgeable of the\nminimum standards of care as reflected  in the federal regulations.  There has not been the\non-going in-service and continuing education at the unit level that is necessary for the staff\nto become knowledgeable of and know how to maintain practice standards  required for\ncompliance with the Court Order.  It is my hope that the new nursing administration will\nimplement systems to immediately  address this deficit.\nG.  Infection Control\nInfection control is weak.  There appears to be little to no follow-up when infections are\ndiscovered.  Follow-up should consist of identification of a pattern if any, and appropriate\nand immediate in-service and training for staff involved.  The Court Monitor consultants\nhave shared with the staff a system that is clear and list the steps necessary to take for an\naccountable infection control program in a nursing facility.  The HCFA surveyor team leader\ncommended DCV for implementing mis new infection control program.  However, to date,\n\nit is unclear which staff person, if any, at DCV is taking responsibility for appropriate follow\nthrough. This is very serious and directly relates to the Court Order in the areas of decubitus\nulcers, incontinence, and nutrition of the residents.  Frail nursing home residents are at great\nrisk of infections and resultant hospitalizations as evidence in the x30 Day Compliance\nReport'.\nH.  Housekeeping\nThere are numerous housekeeping staff.  I have found them to be open and courteous, yet not\nalways present on the units. What is needed is for housekeeping to take ownership and pride\nin the operations of the units to which they are assigned.  It has been suggested by surveyors\nand consultants to the Court Monitor that the housekeeping department make permanent\nassignments of staff  to each of the  units.  Further, it has been advised that housekeeping\nstaff assigned to the units  work closely with the unit clinical coordinator regarding the\nmaintenance of a clean and healthy living environment for the residents \"home\".\nHousekeeping is an important and integral part of the interdisciplinary team.  A sense of\npride and ownership of the units and the hallways and public spaces at DCV would result\nin consistent proactive initiatives for the health and safety of all.  This vital department\ndirectly relates to the Court Order and to infection control activities profiled above.  Frail,\ncompromised residents with open wounds, such as, decubitus ulcers, are prone to infections\nas listed in the \"30 Day Compliance Report'.  Hand-washing  is essential for limiting the\nspread of infection from resident to resident and from staff to resident.  Soap is the most\nimportant element in prevention of infections.  And yet, on numerous occasions I have\nobserved no soap in residents' rooms.  This seems to be an especially chronic problem on\nUnit 5B. For the entire weekend of September 29, 1995, the majority of  rooms on Unit 5B\nwere without soap, yet the Facility Supplies Chief told me there were \"152 cartons of soap\"\non hand.  It is alanning to me  that this situation existed, that staff did not report it, which\n\nmeans proper Hand-washing technique was not being done, and that the situation was not\nrectified immediately.\nI.  Therapeutic Activities\nThere are eighteen therapeutic activities staff at DCV. For the first week of court monitoring\nactivities, staff were nowhere present - absent from public rooms, the units, and resident\nrooms.  After meeting with the therapeutic activities staff and advising them on how to\ncomply with federal regulations, the dining areas on many of the units were transformed into\nthe positive environments described in the Dining section above.  The staff has been very\nopen since this first meeting.  In fact, the Director of the Therapeutic Activities Department\ntold the Court Monitor mat \"at first we thought you were the enemy, now we know you are\nhere to help us.\" Another staff member, who has taken great pride and effort in creating a\nhome like environment in me dining area on his assigned Unit 4A, has specifically expressed\nopenness to any suggestions for improving care.\nThe D.C. Village Residents Choir performed during Resident Rights Week on  October 4,\n1995. Residents who are normally not engaged in their environment nor particularly present\nto time and place, sang solos. This event was organized by the therapeutic activities staff and\ntile residents.\nTherapeutic  activity is crucial to the life  of  frail,  institutionalized  people.  Activities\ndepartment staff must continually be present in the life of all the residents of DCV, including\nworking with nursing department  staff  and teaching nurse aides how to  meaningfully\nengaged all the residents.  The challenge is to provide purposeful activities to total care\nresidents from shift to shift, instead of, for example, putting residents to bed directly after\ndinner, as I so often observe at DCV.  Total care residents at DCV are a neglected group.\nThis will be described more fully  under the  sections addressing the Court Order  and\n8\n\ndecubitus ulcer,  incontinence, and nutrition care.\nJ.  Medicine\nThe Medical Director is a positive presence at DCV and a role model of  professional\nbehavior.  The Medical Director has been in the position for one year.\nThere  are four full-time  medical doctors, including the psychiatrist, and one part-time\nmedical doctor on staff at DCV.  In addition, a fee for service medical doctor has recently\nbeen brought in to provide medical coverage for the unit previously covered by Dr. Barnes,\nwho died suddenly in September.  DCV likely has more medical doctors on staff than most\nnursing home in this country.\nI believe the medical doctors at DCV are committed and care.  However, they are currently\norganized in such a way as to prevent them from functioning as team members within the\nDepartment of Medicine.  The DCV medical staffs belong to the Doctors Council union.\nOn September 7,1995, the Doctors Council staff representative met with Dr. Harvey Sloane,\nCommissioner of Public Health for the District of Columbia.  Dr. Sloane asked the Court\nMonitor  to  attend.  Also  attending  the  meeting  were  Ms.  Gladys  Fountain,  Interim\nAdministrator for Long Term Care for the District of Columbia, the Executive Director of\nDCV, the medical doctors on staff at DCV, the Medical Director, and a labor representative\nfrom the Department of Human Services of the District of Columbia.\nThe Doctors Council staff representative described the medical staff as \"labor\" and the\nMedical Director as \"management\".  Dr. Sloane, who is also a medical doctor, stated that in\nall his experience he has never known attending medical staff  and psychiatrists to be\nunionized and defining themselves as \"labor\". Apparently, in the District of Columbia, only\nmedical doctors who work in public facilities are unionized.  Historically in other east coast\n\ncities doctors unions were formed and needed for interns and residents to protect their\nworking  conditions  while  still formally  learning within  institutions, not  for  attending\nphysicians and psychiatrists.\nIn the somewhat small meeting on September 7, the Doctors Council staff representative\nspoke for the DCV medical staff (all of whom were present) to the medical director and to\nthe rest of the attendees. Not once did any of the medical staff address the Medical Director\ndirectly.  There appeared to be near anger and hostility toward the Medical Director from the\nunion representative, who expressed negative input she received from medical staff  with\nno effort to validate the input.\nThe staff representative of the Doctors Union is not knowledgeable of the Nursing Home\nReform  Law and, thus, of its minimum standards of care for nursing facility  residents\nidentified in the federal regulations.  The Doctors Union staff representative is not a health\nprofessional and, thus, does not have the professional focus on the resident centered care\nrequired in long term care.  The focus seems to be on maintaining the artificial dichotomy\nbetween five medical doctors and one medical director and the administration.\nA non-collegial and unprofessional relationship currently exists at DCV between the medical\nstaff and the Medical Director.  The medical staff alliance with the Doctors Council instead\nof the Medical Director creates an inherent tension within the medical department at DCV\nwhere there should be collaboration for the good of resident care.  The current structure has\nfueled a malaise and a lack of motivation within the medical staff to continually upgrade\ntheir education, which is manifested in the low level of knowledge of the federal regulations\nmat are the minimum standards of care for nursing facility residents.  This directly relates\nto the Court Order in the areas of care of decubitus ulcers, nutrition, and medications which\nwill be addressed in this Status Report under the appropriate sections of the Court Order.\n10\n\nThe  medical  staff  virtually  ignore  all recommendations  by the  Medical  Director  for\nattendance at continuing education programs (offered locally) that directly relate to resident\ncare issues at DCV and care areas identified in the Court Order.  For example, on October\n11,1995, a nationally recognized expert on pressure ulcers (a medical doctor) spoke locally\non the latest treatment modalities for the care of decubitus ulcers.  The medical  staff,\ntreatment nurses, and the Court Monitor were informed of the meeting and invited.  The two\nday-treatment nurses and the Court Monitor attended, but no medical staff from DCV were\npresent  At the September 7, meeting the psychiatrist commented that \"if DCV is going to\nclose why should we upgrade our continuing education\".\nA number of the medical staff are dedicated and concerned professionals, but their alliance\nwith the Doctors Council creates the pervasive attitude of mistrust and defensiveness to\nconstructive input and feedback from the Medical Director and is obstructing the ability of\nthe medical department to participate fully  as an interdisciplinary team in the care of\nresidents at DCV. These attitudes and practices then permeate to the rest of the institution.\nThe Doctors Council staff representative is the only presence associated with DCV whose\nprimary goal is not focused on improving resident care.  This is a reflection on the nature of\nthe position and not the person.  Much of the Medical Director's time is spent responding\nto communications from the Doctors Council.  The relationship is destructive to the process\nof improved resident care, and impedes the ability of DCV to comply with the Court Order.\nRequest to the Court\nI, therefore, respectfully request that the Court advise the medical staff at DCV to suspend\ntheir relationship with the Doctors Council staff representative for as long as DCV remains\nopen. And, further, to communicate and relate directly to the Medical Director in all areas\nrelated to resident care and to follow the Medical Director's direction, especially in her\n11\n\nrecommendations for continuing education, which are always based on the best interests of\nthe residents of DCV.\nIIL  STATUS OF COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDER\nFuture monthly status reports will address each of the areas in the Court Order.  In order to\ncommence monitoring and responsibly assess data, the above systems assessment was\nrequired.  Updates on systems functions  will be given in future  status reports when\napplicable to compliance with the specific areas of the Court Order.\nA.  Medical and Nursing Care\n1.  Care of Decubitus Ulcers\na.  Defendants shall immediately cease the use of Elase and Intrasite gel\ninappropriately for treatment of decubitus ulcers.\nb.  Defendants shall immediately ensure that all DCV residents receive\nappropriate and adequate preventive medical and nursing care and timely treatment for\ndecubitus ulcers and/or other skin breakdown sufficient to maintain their good health.\nTo this end, Defendants shall assess all residents for risk of skin breakdown within two\ndays from the date of entry of this Stipulated Order, and shall develop and implement\nwithin twenty days thereafter, for each resident identified as at risk, a treatment plan\nfully adequate to prevent skin breakdown and/or to treat existing skin breakdown.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nElase is not being used for the treatment of decubitus ulcers.  Intrasite gel is prescribed and\nis used. The treatment nurses have been interviewed and observed and they are appropriately\napplying intrasite gel.  Further monitoring is required to determine the current level and\nsource of knowledge of the medical staff prescribing intrasite gel.\n12\nTT\n\nThere are four treatment nurses, two on the day shift and two on the evening.  On each shift\none nurse covers Units 5A, 5B, 4A, 4B, and the second treatment nurse covers Units 3 A, 3B,\n2A, IB.  The treatment nurses treat identified decubitus ulcers.  One treatment nurse is a\nDCV employee and has known the residents for many years.  The three other treatment\nnurses are contract nurses but are permanently assigned.  The treatment nurses have been\nobserved to use appropriate sterile technique.  At present there is still lack of coverage for\nthe care of decubitus ulcers on the weekends.\nConcerns\nI have a number of serious concerns regarding the care of residents with decubitus ulcers,\nwhich require further and on-going monitoring.  I am hopeful the new leadership in nursing\nadministration will tend to these concerns immediately.  They are the following:\n(1) There are no systematic and daily assessments to check for skin breakdown and\nto give early warning signs of the development of decubitus ulcers.  On several occasions in\nthe past month, decubiti were first observed at Level m.  This means that the wound is deep\nand possibly draining. It is alarming that these wounds were not discovered earlier at Level\nII  which  means  broken  skin,  at  Level  I  superficial  wound,  or  preventive  measures\nimplemented.  It is not clear how decubiti are discovered and get on the treatment nurses list.\nDaily nursing skin check rounds would discover possible pressure sores.  It is hopeful that\nwith the new nursing administration, unit coordinators will receive proper supervision, and\nin turn properly supervise the nurse aides on their units.  On-going continuing education is\nneeded for all staff.\n(2) The treatment nurses know the residents decubitus ulcers but not the total care of\nthe residents.  This can lead to communications breakdown and delay in the timely sharing\nof information necessary for an up-to-date interdisciplinary care plan and continuity of care.\n13\n\n(3) When the treatment nurses are not present on the units, including weekends,\ndecubiti care and skin care are not part of nursing practice.  This violates general standards\nof nursing practice.\nOn Sunday evening, September 24, 1995, the Court Monitor was touring the units with a\nnursing home systems expert consultant  From the hallway on unit 3 A came a distinct odor -\nthe odor of decubiti and urine. Upon entering the resident room which was the source of the\nodor, Mr. J.B. was found lying on his Level IV stage decubitus ulcer and soaked with urine.\nThe nurse on duty did not seem to notice.  I have no doubt that the nurse on duty, who has\nbeen on the unit for years, has affection for  Mr. J.B., who had also been on the unit for\nyears.  In 1990 he was walking, on September 24, he was totally contracted in his bed, so\nmuch so that decubiti were developing on his knuckles which were contracted up under his\nchin. Mr. J.B. was scheduled on Tuesday of that week to enter a hospital in the District for\na surgical procedure for the decubiti on his hip.  The Medical Director was notified on\nMonday, September 25, as well as the physical therapist who assessed Mr. B. and  noted that\nthere was no range of motion or rehabilitation plan of care in his chart.  The Medical\nDirector had Mr. B. transferred that morning to the subacute unit of the hospital to receive\nthe care he was not receiving at DCV.  On Monday afternoon, the HCFA surveyors arrived.\n(4) Decubitus ulcer care and prevention especially for frail, institutionalized people\nrequire an interdisciplinary approach including all departments.  Currently, this is lacking at\nDCV.\nI believe, if medicine more fully participates in the interdisciplinary team and upgrades it\ncontinuing education; nursing administration provides leadership to nursing which will really\nprovide direction for the entire facility; nutrition and dietary become proactive; housekeeping\n14\n\nkeeps and maintains clean living spaces; pharmacy becomes proactive; while the physical\ntherapy  and  occupational  therapy  departments  are  already  fully  participating  as\ninterdisciplinary team members, residents rights will be protected.  However, it will take\nnothing less man the full commitment of all departments.\n2.  Care of Incontinent Residents\nDefendants shall immediately ensure that all incontinent DCV residents\nreceive appropriate, adequate and timely nursing care in accordance with generally\naccepted  nursing standards.  For residents who have been identified  as subject to\nbecoming incontinent, nursing staff shall make rounds to check on their individual\ncondition at least once every two hours.  Nursing staff shall take all appropriate steps\nto  care  for  and  clean  those  residents  who  need  nursing  attention  due  to  their\nincontinence.  Nursing staff shall take special care to clean and treat ulcerated areas\nthat may have become soiled due to incontinence.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nThe best way to assess compliance in this area is to periodically assess the residents.  At\ntimes residents are clean and dry and, therefore, there is partial compliance.  However, on\nother occasions, I have found residents to be sitting in urine for quite some time, that is, time\nenough for an odor to develop.\nOn-going continuing education is necessary for all staff including certified nurse aides and\nthe treatment nurses.\nIn all due respect, the position charts which are placed at the end of resident beds and which\nmake the '30 Day Compliance Report' so voluminous, are meaningless.  On numerous\noccasions I have observed residents in urine for several hours on a shift and yet the position\nchart has been neatly checked and initialed.  On the evening of October 4,1995,1 observed\na resident, Ms. M.H. at 7pm, 8pm, and at 9:30pm-at that time with the evening nurse\n15\n\nsupervisors. At all those times, Ms. B. was in the same position and she and her bed clothing\nwere wet  At 7pm, the position chart intended to document turning every two hours had not\nbeen completed since 3pm. At 8pm the chart had been filled in, and at 9:30pm Ms. B's bed\nclothing was soiled with feces.  Check-off charts often lead to slovenly practices and not\nnecessarily with deliberate intent.\nImmediate Remedies Needed\n(1) Leadership from the nursing office by developing and providing a role description\nfor unit coordinators outlining basic care practices, supervisory requirements and techniques\nfor nursing assistants, and daily reporting procedures to nursing administration.  In this way,\nthe unit coordinators take ownership and responsibility for the care status of the residents on\ntheir units, and nursing administration becomes accountable for the care being given on the\nunits. Nursing administration must be a constant presence on the units.\n(2) Interdisciplinary  team  approach  to resident  care  as  described  above  in the\ndecubitus ulcers section under Concerns (4).  Housekeeping and the ever presence of soap\nto prevent spreading infections from one incontinent resident to another are especially vital.\n(3) There are procedures for a restorative bowel and bladder training program now\non each unit.  With the assistance of nursing administration and staff development, this\nshould be systematically implemented.\nI have come to realize a pattern at DCV which saddens me.  Residents who cannot advocate\nfor themselves are victims of passive neglect.  These are residents who for the most part\ncannot communicate; have restricted mobility; need nearly total care; have decubitus ulcers;\nare incontinent; have severe contracture; and are dehydrated.  Many of these conditions are\noften preventable, or are susceptible to improvement.  A definition of passive neglect is the\n16\n\n\"deprivation of goods or services which are necessary to maintain physical or mental health,\nwithout  a  conscious  attempt  to  inflict  physical  or  emotional  distress  (for  example,\nabandonment or denial of services because of inadequate knowledge.)\" Persistent neglectful\npractices result in abuse.\nI stand by my statement at the end of the Preliminary Status Report, submitted in September.\nThat is, I find the staff at DCV to be caring and motivated, but there is an immediate need\nfor on-going continuing education.  Neglect and abuse occur when staff are poorly trained\nand poorly supervised  Frail, institutionalized residents present care challenges which\nrequire sensitivity and daily support to the staff to prevent neglect and abuse of the residents.\nRecommendations in this Report do not cost money, they do cost in a priceless commodity\n- time, commitment, and caring.\n3.  Adequate and Appropriate Nursing Staff\na.  Defendants shall ensure that continuity of nursing staff is maintained\nto the maximum extent feasible during all shifts, seven days a week, on all DCV living\nunits.\nb. By no later than January 1,1996, Defendants shall ensure that there is\na sufficient permanent nursing staff at DCV to ensure that DCV does not routinely rely\non contract nurses.  Nothing herein prevents the use of contract nurses in emergency\nsituations or to ensure that adequate nursing staff is available to care for DCV residents.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nWith the announced closure of DCV in August 1995, this section will probably never\nachieve full compliance. Many staff are resigning or opting for early retirement offers, and\nit is difficult to attract new staff.  However, there are efforts to stabilize the staffing.\n17\nITT\n\nIn the first week in October, seven contract nurses were hired under a special arrangement\nwith one of the vendors, National Nurses, Inc.  These contract nurses will be permanently\nassigned to DCV, forty hours per week and apparently have many years experience in long\nterm care. Three will be placed as unit coordinators on three of the units.  Two are planned\nto be placed in the Staff Development Department  One will be placed in quality assurance,\nIn terms of numbers of licensed nursing staff and certified nurse aides (CNAs), DCV is not\nunderstaffed.  In fact, it likely has one of the lowest staff to resident ratios in the country.\nThe problem is the utilization of staff and continuity of care with the use of contract nurses.\nFor example, on the night shift of October 5,1995, at 12:30AM, I observed the licensed\nNurse on duty (a contract nurse) and four nurses aides sitting in the day room with the\ntelevision on.  One nurse aide was with a resident who has a nurse aide solely assigned to\nhim.  One nurse aide did not have her uniform on, I asked the CNA where it was and she\npointed to a chair with her bags in it.\nThe new Director of Nursing (DoN) in the first of weekly meetings with the Court Monitor\non October 12, indicated that one of her priorities is to \"get a handle on contract nurses,\"\nwhich, I must admit, is difficult to do.  I asked a nursing administrator - who does the nurse\nstaffing and the response was \"anyone who can get their hands on the book\".  At any one\ntime I have observed three to four nurses in the nursing office who claimed to be doing\nstaffing for the day.  These particular nurses are former DCV nursing administrators who\ntook early retirement and are now employees of the contract nurse staffing vendors which\nsupply the contract nurses to DCV. There are approximately six vendors.  In addition, there\nis also a DCV non nurse employee who solely does staffing.\nA daily staffing form has been implemented to track nurse staffing for court monitoring.\nThis form includes daily data for each unit listing the census, numbers of licensed staff,\n18\n\nnumbers of contract agency nurse staff, and numbers of CNAs.  Future status reports will\nprovide an analysis of this data.\n4.  Medication Errors\na.  Defendants shall ensure, within fifteen days from the date of entry of\nthis Stipulated Order, that all nursing staff on duty are trained in proper medication\nadministration practices,  and are adequately in serviced on and/or are  sufficiently\naware  of  the  individual  needs  of  the  residents  to  whom  they  are  administering\nmedications.\nb.  Defendants shall ensure, within fifteen days from the date of entry of\nthis Stipulated Order, that all medication errors are recorded, that adequate procedures\nare established to track all medication errors, that any causes for medication errors are\nidentified and remedied, and that any other needed corrective action is taken in a timely\nmanner to minimize medication error risk to the DCV residents.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Further monitoring required\nThe next Status Report to the Court will provide in-depth data in this area.  Random\nmedication pass reviews conducted on September 27,1995, identified two medication errors\nby a contract nurse - eye drops prescribed for the left eye and administered in the right eye.\nRandom medication pass review conducted on October 10, 1995, found six medication pass\nerrors.\nA profile of me Pharmacy Department and the medications prescribed for DCV residents will\nbe given in an upcoming status report.  There are five pharmacists on staff at DCV.  The\nnational norm for the number of prescribed medications a nursing home resident takes is five\nto six. The average number of prescribed medications  DCV residents are taking is eight to\nthirteen.\nIn a meeting with the Department of Medicine on September 12, 1995, the psychiatrist\nindicated  a  lack  of  clarity  regarding  the  appropriate  use  of  prescribed  psychotropic\n19\n\nmedications as indicated in the federal regulations.\nAssessing medication errors cannot be separated from a medication review to  identify\npossible unnecessary drug use.\nB.  Measures Needed to Remedy Shortages\n1.  Food and Drink\nDefendants shall immediately ensure that sufficient supplies of nutritious\nand appropriate food and drink are consistently maintained at DCV and that  each\nresident daily receives adequate, well-balanced, nutritious and appropriate food and\ndrink according to their individual nutritional needs.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Further monitoring required\nThe  next  Status  Report  to  the  Court  will  provide  a profile  of the  Nutrition/Dietary\nDepartment.  The Court Monitor has met with the Chair and a faculty member of the\nDepartment of Nutritional Services at Howard University.  This meeting took place at DCV.\nI expect to have by the next report, and analysis of residents nutritional needs and a daily\nnutritional intake profile.\nMonthly weight logs have been instituted on each unit.  This should be a clear tool for\nquality assurance activities and monitoring nutritional status.  The Dietary Department must\nassume a critical role in taking responsibility for calculating monthly weight loss or gain and\ninitiating proper assessment and care planning if indicated.  The interdisciplinary team plays\na vital role in appropriate nutrition.  Meal observation is also important in ensuring daily\nnutrition.\nDehydration is a reason given for several hospital admissions.  When asked  her opinion\nabout dehydration as a reason for hospital admission a nursing administrator said,  \"it is\nembarrassing.\"  Proper hydration for nursing home residents, including those with gastric\n20\n\ntubes, requires vigilance and routine offering of liquids and flushing of gastric tubes with\nwater.\n2.  Medications, Medical Supplies and Equipment\na.  Defendants shall ensure that adequate and appropriate supplies of\nnecessary  medications,  that  meet  the  individual  needs of the DCV  residents,  are\nconsistently maintained at DCV no later than two days from the date of entry of this\nStipulated Order.\nFurther monitoring required  See A. 4. above\nb. Defendants shall ensure that an adequate and appropriate quantity of\nmedical supplies and equipment, that meet the individual needs of the DCV residents,\nare available for use, as needed, no later than five days from the date of entry of this\nStipulated Order.\nData will be presented in next Status Report.\nc  Defendants shall maintain the plumbing and heating system at DCV to ensure\nthat adequate amounts of hot water, at safe temperatures, are available for use by\nresidents within two days from the date of entry of this Stipulated Order.  Defendants\nshall also ensure that there is sufficient hot water to properly sanitize and clean eating\nutensils, plates and meal-related items.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Compliance\nThe Facility Services Department conducts regular random checks and charts findings.  On\ntwo occasions temperatures in resident bathrooms and common bath areas were validated by\nthe Court Monitor and consultant to be within the mandated temperatures required in D.C.\nregulations (100 to 110 degrees f.)  The actual readings observed were 104 degrees and 105\ndegrees.\n3.  Personal Care Items\n21\n\nData will be presented in next Status Report\nC.  Payment of Vendors\nRequest to the Court\nI respectfully request mat the Court advise me Corporation Counsel on behalf of the District\nof Columbia to supply the Court Monitor with contact names and phone numbers for the\nvendors listed.  I am unable to validate the data in the '30 Day Compliance Report' and to\nmonitor compliance with this area of the Court Order without this information.\nFor weeks I have asked for this information from administration within DCV and from\nvarious District of Columbia government officials.  I have witnessed bureaucratic groupthink\n- a pattern of thinking which stifles the potentially competent into inertia.\nData is presented for the following vendors whose names and numbers were supplied to me\nby the Department of Justice.\nStatus Re: Court Order  As of October 3, 1995  Out of Compliance\nNUTECH Laundry is owed $3535.90 from February 1995. NUTECH no longer has\na contract with DCV.\nHealth Care Laundry Services is owed $24,962.93 for services from July 14-28,1995.\nHealth Care Laundry is not planning to suspend service.\nCentral Armature Works is paid in full.\nHill Rom supplier of specialty beds has referred back payment of approximately\n$20,000 to a collection agency, and with no response forwarded the case to an attorney.\n22\n\nAs of October 12, 1995:\nNational Patient Care Systems supplier of specialty beds has $8110 outstanding from March\n1995. Outstanding: for June - $9030; for July - $9300; for August 1995 - $9400.  National\nPatient Care Systems does not intend to suspend services.\nD.  Services for Individuals with Mental Retardation\n1.  Defendants  shall  place  all  DCV  residents  with  mental  retardation  in\nappropriate community-based  residential and day programs which fully meet their\nindividual needs as identified by appropriate interdisciplinary assessments, no later than\nOctober 31,1995.  Defendants shall ensure that the placements are adequate to meet\neach individual's needs.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Non-Compliance\nAssessment Data\nData have been obtained primarily from the Georgetown University Child Development\nCenter staff at DCV and the Social Services staff person from DCV assigned to the majority\nof the residents with mental retardation (M.R.).\nSince the filing of the Court Order on July 6, 1995, two residents have been transferred out\nof DCV, they are the two people listed in the '30 Day Compliance Report*.  As far as can be\ndetermined, mere has been no assessment of the adequacy of current care to meet their needs.\nFour residents were outplaced on June 30,1995.  One resident, Mr. D.H., deceased, July 13,\n1995.  Currently, there are 15 individuals identified with mental retardation at DCV.\nAccording to the Social Service staff person at DCV, the interdisciplinary assessment team\ninvolved with planning the outplacements of the M.R. residents consist of the following:\n23\n\nDCV Social Service social worker; case manager from the Bureau of Case Management,\nMental Retardation and Developmental Disability Administration (MRDDA), Commission\non Social Services, Department of Human Services, District of Columbia; Georgetown\nUniversity  Child  Development  Center  (GUCDC)  staff  consisting  of  psychologist,\nnutritionist, speech therapist, therapeutic activities; the clinical nurse coordinator for the\nDCV Unit; M.R. resident's attorney if any; and family members) if any.\nThe case manager from the District of Columbia identifies the placement sites usually after\nthe interdisciplinary team meeting.  The placement sites are all under the jurisdiction of\nMRDDA.\nOf the  15 residents identified with mental retardation at DCV, four are identified to be\noutplaced  to the  Kennedy  Institute.  According  to  the  Georgetown  University  Child\nDevelopment Center (GUCDC) staff and the Social Service staff from DCV, no date has\nbeen given for outplacement because of \"contract/budget considerations\" a definition of\nwhich is not known by either source.\nFive residents are scheduled to be outplaced to CARECO.  This outplacement is of great\nconcern to the DCV Social Services Department social worker handling the majority of the\nmental retardation resident outplacements.  The four residents identified to be outplaced to\nCARECO are wheelchair bound.  These residents would be placed on the second and third\nfloors  of the residence.  The concern is fire safety hazards.  Currently, CARECO  is\nremodeling and no date is given for outplacement.  Further monitoring is needed to\ndetermine what are the remodeling plans in relation to residents needs.\nFour  M.R. residents are scheduled to be outplaced to Wholistic Habilitative  Services.\nAttorneys for two of the residents oppose this outplacement because they believe the medical\n24\n\nneeds of these residents require nursing home care beyond the capabilities of the identified\nIntermediate Care Facility/Mental Retardation (ICF/MR).\nAnother resident is scheduled to be outplaced to METRO, Inc. Again this is being delayed\nbecause of the residents \"medical needs\".\nOne resident scheduled to be outplaced to D.C. Family Services is currently hospitalized.\nThe Hearing Commission for a Pratt decree MR. resident is concerned that his physical\nhealth problems may worsen upon discharge from the DC V nursing home care setting, where\nunder the guidance of GUCDC staff his health problems improved.  The concern is that in\noutplacement into the lower level care setting, he may revert to the worse health problems\nwith which he came to DCV.\nThe social worker at DCV is concerned about the ability of some of the identified placements\nto care for the physical needs of the residents, such as, the two residents with tracheotomies,\nhi addition the majority of the M.R. residents have gastrostomy tubes for feeding.  Some of\nthe residents scheduled to be outplaced have compromising medical conditions which leave\ntheir transfer in question at present.  There is concern that their medical conditions may be\nbeyond the capabilities of the staff at the MRDDA identified sites.\nGeorgetown University Child Development Center staff provides training for the staff  of the\nidentified outplacement sites.  This training takes place at DCV.  The District of Columbia\nassesses the outplacement site physical plant.  The social worker from DCV usually visits\nthe identified outplacement site before the resident is discharged.\nAccording to the DCV social worker, at this point in time, it is not known if there are\ncommunity  based  day programs  available  and  appropriate  for  the needs  of the  M.R.\n25\n\nresidents.  Further assessment and monitoring are needed to determine mis.\nI have a number of concerns regarding the outplacement process for  residents with mental\nretardation which require further monitoring, they are the following:\nfa) Outplacement planning process and match of outplacement sites with individual\nneeds  Given the assessment data obtained above, I am very concerned about the decision\nmaking process and rationale for the identification and match of the outplacement sites with\nthe individual needs of the MR. residents.  The Court Monitor will gather information from\nthe Bureau of Case Management, MRDDA, DHS, District of Columbia.\n(b) On-going supervision of placement site staff  From my discussions with staff and\nobservations of the M.R. residents at DCV, I am particularly concerned about the adequacy,\non-going assessment and evaluation, and appropriate and effective supervision of the staff\nof the MRDDA identified outplacement facilities.  The MR. residents at DCV have complex\nphysical, emotional, and behavioral needs.  Staff training off site is one thing, but the\nimplementation and 'how to* of the training in the actual care-giving setting is another.  The\ncurrent planning process for the outplacement of the M.R. residents identifies the case\nmanager from the Bureau of Case Management, MRDDA to do this follow-up.\n© On-eoing evaluation of outplacement site in meeting individual needs  I am\nparticularly concerned about the on-going assessments of the individual resident and the\nadequacy of the outplacement sites to continue to meet care needs.  Seven of the residents\nwith mental retardation at DCV do not come under the Pratt decree.  The case manager from\nthe Bureau of Case Management, MRDDA is identified as the monitor for this activity.\n26\n\nMy concerns listed above are validated by the semi-annual report to the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of Columbia, Evans v. Barry, et al., and the Pratt decrees.  In the report\nsubmitted by the Court Monitor in this matter, the District of Columbia ARC, dated\nSeptember  30,  1995,  data  is  given  on  the  limited  capacity  of  the  Bureau  of  Case\nManagement, MRDDA to assess, evaluate, supervise, and monitor the adequacy of care for\nresidents with mental retardation.\nFurther monitoring necessitates and will include contact with the outplacement vendors and\nMRDDA.\nConcerns Re: Transfer. Outplacement and Discharge of All DCV Residents\nMy concerns regarding the adequacy of outplacement of DCVM.R residents  also  apply\nto the DCV resident population as a whole. The GUCDC staff have described the discharge\nplanning process for the M.R. residents as \"bumpy\" without a \"smooth flow of information\namong\" all parties involved.  In fact, GUCDC staff mentioned that there have been instances\nwhen they have gone to the unit and found that the M.R. resident has been discharged\nwithout their knowledge, yet the GUCDC are the primary caregivers for the residents with\nmental retardation.  Some of my concerns are outlined in my September 21,1995, letter to\nthe Court  The patterns I have been able to assess to date regarding the outplacement process\nfor residents with mental retardation as outlined above, can be generalized to the planning\nprocess for the remainder of the residents at DCV.  Recent responses the Residents Council\nhas received from the Mayor add to my concern that the discharge planning process is based\non fiscal considerations and the meeting of arbitrary time deadlines not residents' health and\nwelfare.\nAs Court Monitor, I am a bit surprised and disappointed in the response of the Office of\nCorporation Counsel on behalf of the District of Columbia to my September 21, letter to the\n27\n\nCourt outlining some of my concerns with transfer and outplacement of residents.  On\nnumerous instances the Court Monitor has received feedback from the Executive Director\nof DCV, from department heads, from staff, from the interim administrator for Long Term\nCare  in  Department  of  Human  Services  of  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  from  the\nCommissioner of Public Health for the District of Columbia that the presence of the Court\nMonitor at DCV has been a \"positive\" influence in advising DCV how to comply with\nminimum standards of care as outlined in the federal and district law and regulations and the\nCourt Order. My concerns regarding the transfer and discharge of DCV residents are shared\nin the same spirit of constructive communication and advice for the best interests of the\nresidents of DCV and the long term care residents of the District of Columbia.\nIn addition to my concerns relating to transfer trauma which is well documented in the\nliterature, my continued concern regarding the transfer and discharge of the residents of DCV\nrelates to the following data:\n(1) Social services department staff at DCV has described the outplacement process\nas \"chaotic\".  The social worker (s.w.) estimates that it will take \"at least a year\"\nto outplace all residents and that many residents no one may accept, especially the residents\nwith mental illness.  In addition, the s.w. mentioned that the transfer search will probably\nhave to go beyond the 50 mile radius planned. An interesting point shared by the s.w. is that\nhistorically DCV has accepted hard to place residents, that is, \"a dumping ground  for\nresidents  no  one  else  wanted.\"  Therefore,  closing  of  DCV  may  lead  to  increased\nhomelessness of the helpless in the District of Columbia.\n(2) Many nursing homes do not admit medicaid residents with the severe decubitus\nulcers unfortunately many of the DCV residents still have.\n28\n\n(3) As gleaned from the 'Outplacement Meetings for Residents with Mental Illness'\nto date there are not adequate numbers of appropriate placements for these residents.  In  the\nplanning meetings, DCV position is to transfer these residents to a nursing home and then\nwithin a year or so, when and if adequate placements may develop, transfer them to the\nappropriate setting.  This disruption in environment is detrimental to any older person, but\nespecially to those with mental illness whose care needs for a sense of autonomy, security,\nand control of the environment are critical.\n(4) m a meeting on Monday, September 18,1995, at DCV with Dr. Harvey Sloane,\nCommissioner Public Health for the District of Columbia, Ms. Gladys Fountain, Interim\nAdministrator  for  Long Term Care for the District  of Columbia and other District of\nColumbia government officials, as well as DCV administration, Dr. Sloane suggested I visit\na local hospital which is an identified outplacement site. Dr. Sloane suggested I visit this site\nto oversee the staff knowledge of and competence in the care of decubitus ulcers.  Many of\nthe decubitus ulcers at DCV either originate at this designated outplacement site or further\ndevelop and multiply there while DCV residents are admitted.  In fact, one resident returned\nto DCV on Thursday, October 13,1995, from this outplacement site with four new decubiti.\n(5) The president of the Residents' Council at DCV, Mr. C.F., attended an interfaith\nministers meeting last week in which the Mayor was also present.  Mr. C.F. introduced\nhimself and told the mayor of his concerns regarding closure of DCV, upon hearing this the\nMayor told Mr. C.F. that he did not have time to speak with him and walked away.  The\nmayor did meet with a few residents of DCV on October 11,1995, at City Hall.  The Mayor\nspent a few minutes with the residents and said that DCV costs \"$30,000,000 a year to run\"\nand it is closing.\n29\n\nThere is enormous financial waste in the operation of DCV.  In a future status report to the\nCourt, I will present a profile of how DCV can be competently operated and at a savings of\nsignificant  millions  of dollars per year.  This profile  will reflect  the input of health\nprofessionals in me District of Columbia who have a commitment to the District, a concern\nfor the long term care residents of the District of Columbia, and expertise in long term care\npractice, education, research, and in the operations of cost effective and quality care giving\nfacilities.\n2. Defendants shall ensure uninterrupted clinical services, habilitation, and other\nservices to all DCV residents with mental retardation.  Such services shall remain in\neffect until all DCV residents with mental retardation are outplaced into appropriate\ncommunity settings in accordance with the above provision.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nFurther monitoring required\nAssessment Data\nThe Georgetown University Child Development Center staff provide habilitation services to\nthe residents with mental retardation.  GUCDC hours are primarily 9AM to 5PM, with some\noverlap into the evening hours, Monday through Friday.  Currently the contract for the\nGUCDC is due to expire on December 31,1995.\nFurther monitoring is required to more fully assess the staff on duty on the evening, night,\nand weekend shifts.  Observations of M.R. residents and staff and interviews with DCV staff\nindicate that on hours, shifts, and days that GUCDC staff are  not present on the unit,\nhabilitation and clinical services are not performed.  During the evening, night, and weekend\nshifts when contract nurses are on duty this is even more problematic because of the lack of\nknowledge of the residents, which leads to lack of continuity of care.\n30\n\n3. No individuals with mental retardation shall be admitted to DCV in the future\nexcept where this Court specifically approves the proposed admission.\nStates Re: Court Order  Full Compliance\n31",

STATUS RE: COURT ORDER  40\n\nfederal and District law and regulations, and the Court Orders, including Stipulated Order\nof July 6, 1995.  The Court Order of July 6, pertains to the establishment and\nmaintenance of residents rights and the status of compliance will be directly reflected in\nthe quality of the outplacement plans and the transfer of residents.  It will also be a\nmeasure of the humanity of the District of Columbia.  The transfer of the residents\nliterally can be a life or death determining factor for the residents of DCV.  The\noutplacement of the residents, the planning surrounding it and the transfer of residents to\nnew homes is the most important activity to take place now until closing.\nNothing less than a full commitment on the part of every single employee at DCV is vital\nto making the outplacement process a humane one for the residents.  I am confident DCV\ncan rise to the occasion.\nThis Status Report is divided into three main sections.  The first addresses the\noutplacement process and the November 7, 1995 Order Modifying Stipulated Order of\nJuly 6. 1995.  The second section gives an update of systems as a follow-up to the\nOverview of Systems in the October Status Report.  The third section addresses the\nStipulated Court Order of July 6, 1995.\nI.  NOVEMBER 7,1995, ORDER MODIFYING STIPULATED ORDER OF\nJULY 6,1995\nB.  The Monitor shall have authority to review and advise on Defendants'\ncompliance with District and federal law.\nC.  Review compliance with provisions of discharge plan to ensure the safe and\norderly removal of the residents and to protect their health, safety, welfare, and\nrights, including the residents' rights to an opportunity for participation in their\ndischarge process.\n\nThis section of the first Status Report after the expansion of the Court Monitor's duties\nwill address the November 7, 1995, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6. 1995 in\nthe following areas:\n1. Assessment of the outplacement process to date, before and since the\nNovember 7 modification of duties;\n2.  Recommendations based on assessment data;\n3.  Action Steps put in place by DCV to address the concerns regarding the\noutplacement process;\n4.  A profile of one unit and a brief case study of one resident which can be\ngeneralized to all the residents at DCV, profiling life at DCV, how it impacts some\nresidents now, and how with the implementation of the recommendations of a humane\noutplacement process, life could improve for the residents and also provide a discharge\noutplacement plan that would give direction to the receiving facilities at the residents new\nhome;\n5.  Outplacement of residents with mental illness, assessment and\nrecommendations and action steps to be implemented by Dr. Mary Alice Crockett, the\nMedical Director, who is charged by Mr. Silas Butler to oversee the outplacement of the\nresidents with mental illness.  This section ends with a Request to the Court\nThe outplacement of the residents with mental retardation is addressed in this Report\nunder the July 6, 1995 Stipulated Court Order Section D. Residents with Mental\nRetardation;\n\n1.  ASSESSMENT\nThe Court Monitor first began attending the weekly outplacement meetings on October\n25, 1995. These meeting are chaired by Mr. Silas Butler, Deputy Administrator, DCV.\nIn attendance are the social services department, usually the department head; the long\nterm care ombuds person for the District of Columbia; Ms. Corrie Kemp, Chief, Central\nReferral Bureau for the District; and now the Court Monitor.\nThe following is assessment data the Court Monitor has gleaned from attendance at\noutplacement meetings, discussions with staff, conversations with all concerned parties to\nthe Court Order, and most important from the residents on the units and at the bedside.\nI want to assure the Court, that the assessment data listed has lead to the remedies\nrecommended by the Court Monitor that follow, and which I am happy to report are in\nthe process of being implemented.  It is a tribute to the Executive Director of DCV, Ms.\nAlberta Brasfield, that she had the wisdom to appoint Mr. Silas Butler, Deputy\nAdministrator to oversee the outplacement process for the residents.  I find Mr. Butler to\nbe a professional genuinely concerned about improving the life of the residents, proactive\nin improving the outplacement process, and completely open to and not defensive about\nrecommendations and advice on how to comply with federal and district law and\nregulations and the Court Orders.  Mr. Butler is rising to the occasion and has emerged as\na constructive leader.\nAssessment Data\nEarly on it became evident to the Court Monitor, despite the pronouncements and\nassurances from within DCV and District of Columbia government officials, that:\n-  there were no interdisciplinary care plans for the residents;\n\n-  DCV was relying on the receiving facilities to develop these plans, despite the\nfact it is the caregivers at DCV who know the residents, in some instances for decades;\n-  the pre-placement packages to be shared with potential outplacement sites\ndeveloped by the social services department were sparse at best and did not present a\nclear picture of the individual, the resident;\n- if this process was left to continue, the residents would be at a supreme\ndisadvantage and likely to suffer transfer trauma and possible early death;\n- the outplacement of residents was not cohesive and in fact was disorganized;\n-  the outplacement process was beyond the ability of one department (social\nservices) to handle, that in fact all departments relevant to the life of the residents had to\nbe involved in order to present a clear and relevant view of the resident to the outplacing\nfacility;\n- residents were not being systematically informed of their transfer and given\nchoices;\n-  no resident was receiving any type of counseling whatsoever to decrease the\nanxiety and trauma associated with moving to a new home.  The professional literature\nassociates this lack of counseling with adverse consequences which in many instances\nleads to early and unnecessary death.\nAll of the above findings were in violation of residents rights, federal and District law and\nregulations, and the Court Order.  Indeed several residents outplaced to date have\nsuffered.  One Ms. E.W. outplaced on October 9, died two and one half weeks later.  At\ntime of transfer Ms. E.W.'s health condition in no way indicated imminent death.  One\nresident outplaced on October 17, Ms. M.T., stopped eating and was hospitalized, another\nresident outplaced October 20, Ms. D.L., stopped talking.  A fourth resident, Ms. E.B., on\nthe morning of outplacement, October 23, became so anxious that she began roaming the\n\nhalls and running into offices and rooms, seeking solace.  Furthermore, she was unable to\nidentify to which nursing home she was moving.  Staff knowledge of transfer trauma\nphenomenon would have indicated a plan of action for Ms. E.B. which would have\nresulted in her not moving out that day, and not until her anxiety was diminished by\ntherapeutic interventions such as counseling by a supportive staff.  In addition, the\nResidents Council is actively campaigning through calling press conferences and letter\nwriting to public officials to keep DCV open.\nTwo residents have been outplaced from the hospital where they were transferred.  These\nresidents were outplaced with no input from DCV describing their life and care needs\ngleaned from years of knowledge from living with these individuals at DCV. One\nresident with mental retardation, Mr. L.S., was outplaced from the hospital with both\narms and legs restrained.  Mr. L was never restrained at DCV. Clearly Mr. L.'s\nIndividual Habilitation Plan was not communicated.  Recommendations indicated by this\nevent are listed in this Status Report under the July 6, 1995, Stipulated Court Order.\nSection D. Residents with Mental Retardation.\nSince August 1995, 24 residents have been discharged.  According to District of\nColumbia Law, the Long-Term Care Ombuds person is to receive written notice of intent\nto discharge.  The Long-Term Care Ombuds person did not receive notice for 11 of the\n24 residents discharged to date.\nOne proposed outplacement site, J.B. Johnson Nursing Home is in crisis as profiled in the\nmedia this week.  There are dangerously low numbers of staff, food supplies, and lack of\npayments to employees and vendors.  In fact some staff from DCV were detailed there\nthis past week.  The proposed outplacement of the five residents identified for acceptance\n\nat this facility has been put on hold.  Four D.C. long term care ombuds persons were\nscheduled to visit the facility as of today, November 30.  The ombuds attends the weekly\noutplacement meetings and will commence devoting one day a week to follow up on\noutplacement sites as needed by the Court Monitor.  In addition, the ombuds will be\nvisiting residents who have already been outplaced and they will be providing data to the\nCourt Monitor.\nOn November 29, the Court Monitor along with the ombuds person visited a proposed\noutplacement site, Hadley Hospital Skilled Unit, with 20 beds available for DCV\nresidents.\nAt the monthly outplacement meeting held Monday, November 27, providers attending\nmentioned that nursing homes have not received payment for over 60 days approaching\n90 days.  In addition, the providers said that most facilities in Maryland with D.C.\nmedicaid provider contracts are not accepting residents from the District of Columbia\nbecause of this lack of payment.\n2.  RECOMMENDATIONS\nA)  Expand Departments Involved in Outplacement  The outplacement process\nteam be expanded beyond the social services department to also include nursing, dietary,\ntherapeutic recreation departments, and when appropriate physical therapy and\noccupational therapy.\nB)  Interdisciplinary Team Care Plans  All residents must have an\ninterdisciplinary team care plan which reflects a counseling program for minimizing\n\ntransfer trauma and which gives direction to the receiving home regarding the individual's\nunique care needs.  This will help ensure that there will be continuity of care.  Not only is\nthis humane, but it is also in accordance with federal and District law and regulations.\nThe format for these care plans are available on the units and in fact are in each resident's\nchart.  Some have already been developed through the good work of some of the unit\nclinical nurse coordinators and the Associate Directors of Nursing (ADONs).  Those\nalready developed can serve as a model for other staff.  The format is part of the tracking\nsystem the Court Monitor's nursing home systems expert consultant brought to the\nfacility in order to assess compliance with the Court Order.  If this interdisciplinary\ndischarge care plan is carried out successfully, it can serve as a model for the long term\ncare community of the District of Columbia.\nC)  Social Service and Nursing Departments  Social services department must\nwork closely with the nursing department and in all instances inform the two (ADONs) of\nall residents scheduled for discharge.  In this way, priority can be given to the\ndevelopment of the above described interdisciplinary care plans.\nD)  24 hour Availability of Staff to Counsel Residents  At all times including day,\nevening, and night shifts, residents must have an opportunity to talk about their feelings\nregarding moving to a new home.  To do this, all staff who come in contact with\nresidents, including housekeeping, must first be sensitized to their concerns and feelings,\nso they can in turn help residents.  This task is too much to ask of and beyond the\ncapability of one department.  However, the social services department should certainly\ncontinue to take the lead as the initial contact for the outplacement facilities, coordinating\nthe sending of appropriate plans, arranging transportation so that the residents may visit\nproposed transfer homes, and assisting with counseling.\n\nE)  Therapeutic Music  Soothing music at a low volume be piped into the public\naddress system in order to effect a calming atmosphere conducive to healing from a major\nlife stress - the loss of one's home.  This has been requested by the Residents Council and\nalso suggested by a nursing homes system expert consultant to the Court Monitor.  Mr.\nSilas Butler, Deputy Administrator, DCV, has said he will follow through with this\nrequest.  A good resource in choosing music which is therapeutic for this population of\nresidents is Ms. Celeste Brooks, the music therapist from the department of therapeutic\nrecreation.\n3.  ACTION STEPS\nThe following are action steps DCV has initiated and has indicated a commitment to\ncontinuing, I applaud these efforts.  All these action steps will be closely monitored.\nA)  Model Plan to be Instituted on Each Unit for Counseling Residents to\nMinimize Transfer Trauma  On November 13, 1995, Mr. Silas Butler and the Court\nMonitor met with the social services department.  Mr. Butler requested that the social\nservices department develop a model plan to be instituted on each unit for counseling\nresidents to minimize transfer trauma.  This plan is to be reviewed by Mr. Butler and the\nCourt Monitor.\nThe rationale for this approach, according to Mr. Butler, is the following:\n-  direct care staff do not know how to deal with upset residents regarding transfer\ntrauma;\n-  staff need to be sensitized to clues in changes in behaviors of residents which\nmay indicate relocation stress and anxiety;\n\n-  research studies indicate that if signs and symptoms are identified early enough\ntransfer trauma is minimized;\n-  everyone on the unit who comes in contact with resents should be part of the\nresident support system, especially the nurse aides, but also including housekeeping;\n-  a model will give unit supervisors a framework with which to operate;\n-  department heads will have a focus for expectations of performance to bring to\ntheir staff.\nMr. Butler indicated that this is a new mission for DCV and that closure presents an\nopportunity to improve the total system of care, which does not cost money, but does\npresent a new way to add to the quality of life of the \"people that we serve.\"  The success\nof outplacement can only be measured in the way the residents are interacting in their\nnew homes.  Interdisciplinary care plans should reflect progress in this action step.  The\npoint should not be lost, that the bottom line for the receiving facilities is the\nreimbursable dollars they will receive for admitting the residents.  Therefore, as Mr.\nButler has said, \"we must be advocates for the residents who cannot advocate for\nthemselves.\"\nIn October the Court Monitor distributed to all department heads and administration\ncurrent literature on transfer trauma which identifies model interdisciplinary care plans to\nminimize the stress of relocation and the trauma involved for the residents.  These articles\nmust be copied and be readily available to all staff directly involved in planning\ninterdisciplinary discharge care.\n10\n\nOn November 14, the Court Monitor met with Dr. Harvey Sloane, Commissioner of\nPublic Health for the District of Columbia and Ms. Gladys Fountain, Interim\nAdministrator for Long Term Care.  I informed them of the following:\n- there is a need for interdisciplinary team care plans reflective of the residents\n\"highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well being\" including counseling\nregarding mrnimiTing transfer trauma;\n-  the interdisciplinary care plan could be utilized as the discharge plan in\ncompliance with federal and District law and regulations, and the Court Orders;\n- the interdisciplinary team care plan could be used as a model discharge care plan\nfor the long term care community of the District of Columbia;\n-  the discharge care plan could enhance the image of DCV employees in the\ncommunity, which Dr. Sloane mentioned was low.\nThe Court Monitor assured Dr. Sloane that the interdisciplinary team care plans were not\na new 'paperwork' requirement, but in fact exist on the units and are in the process of\nbeing implemented as described in recommendation \"b.\" above.\nB)  Inform Clinical Nurse Unit Coordinators  On November 21, the Executive\nDirector, the Deputy Executive Director, and the Court Monitor met with the two\nADONs), the unit clinical nurse coordinators, and the new nursing staff development and\nquality assurance nurses responsible for education at the unit level.  The Executive\nDirector stressed she expects the nursing department to rise to the occasion and assume\nthe leadership role vital for the successful development and implementation of the\ninterdisciplinary care plans.  Mr. Butler stressed that these plans would be the \"basis the\nreceiving nursing homes will have in order to put in place supports that will ensure\nquality of care (and that) the residents deserve the best that we have to offer.\"  The\n11\n\nmeeting was turned over to the ADONs with the charge, \"it is your plan not ours because\nyou know the residents the best.\"\nThe success of the outplacement process and whether or not it can be called humane\ndepends on the commitment of all departments but most especially the nursing\ndepartment.  It is this department that has the responsibility for the 24 hour care of the\nresidents and has the responsibility by federal law and regulations to coordinate the\ninterdisciplinary care plans.  The following is pertinent for the nursing department, the\nsocial services department, as well as all the  interdisciplinary departments:  unproductive\ngroup process dynamics must be set aside for the one goal of a humane discharge\nplanning process.  Resident's life or death literally depends upon it.\nMs. Disu, the new Associate Director of Nursing shared her model care plan developed\nfor Mr. J.B. who was profiled in the October Status Report.  This is a fine example of\nwhat nursing care can be at DCV.  Ms. Disu developed the care plan at the bedside\ninvolving Mr. J.B. as much as possible, helped implement restorative programs, such as\nrange of motion, brought in nutrition consult, physical therapy and occupational therapy,\ndiscovered that Mr. J.B. had a urinary tract infection, and began discussing with Mr. J.B.\nhis eventual transfer to another facility.  All of this is reflected in the interdisciplinary\ncare plan and is a fine example for all staff to utilize.  I especially recommend that social\nservice as well as the rest of the staff at DCV use this care plan as a model.  Ms. Disu has\ninitiated implementation of care plans that give direction on how to counsel residents and\nprepare them for their move\nC)  Meeting with Residents. Relatives. Conservators and Responsible Party\nA 'Resident Outplacement Meeting with Residents, Relatives, Conservators and\n12\n\nResponsible Party' took place on Tuesday evening, November 21, 1995.  In attendance\nwere about fifteen residents and about fifteen family members.  Presenting and discussing\nwith the attendees were Ms. Gladys Fountain, Interim Administrator for Long Term Care,\nDistrict of Columbia; Ms. Alberta Brasfield, Executive Director, DCV; Mr. Paul Offher,\nCommissioner Health Care Finance for the District of Columbia; Ms. Helen Green,\nMedicaid, Medicare, Income Maintenance for the District of Columbia; Ms. Anne Hart,\nDistrict of Columbia, Long Term Care Ombudsman; Revered Wesley Toepper, Chaplain,\nDCV; the Vice President of Providence Hospital and proposed outplacement site; the\nNursing Home Administrator for Hadley Hospital Skilled Unit, a proposed outplacement\nsite; the Vice President of Managed Care Services, Global Health Management, purchaser\nof Carrol Manor Nursing Home, a proposed outplacement site.  Also present was Mr.\nSilas Butler, Deputy Administrator, DCV.\nThese meetings are scheduled to take place again in December and in January.  A\npoignant aspect of this meeting was the presentation by Rev. Toeffer on the grieving\nprocess the residents are experiencing (as well as the staff) in suffering a major life loss -\nthe loss of one's home.  Rev. Toeffer has been at DCV for thirty years, is a full-time\nChaplain and a District of Columbia government employee.\nD)  Meet with All Department Heads to \"lay groundwork to get everyone sensitive\nto issues of transfer trauma\" (Mr. Butler)  On Tuesday morning, November 28, Ms.\nAlberta Brasfield, Executive Director, and Mr. Silas Butler, Deputy Director, met with all\ndepartment heads, the social service staff, and Rev. Toeffer.  Rev. Toeffer repeated his\npresentation given Tuesday evening, November 21, to residents and families.  Ms.\nBrasfield communicated her expectation for compassionate leadership behavior on the\npart of all.  With Mr. Butler's leadership the outplacement process has a simple goal: at\n13\n\nevery possible intervention opportunity and on a daily basis, all staff should be prepared\nto listen to the residents concerns regarding transfer, even for example, during bathing,\ndining, activities, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and \"to be genuinely kind and\nconcerned about each other, to take care of residents, and to take care of each other.\"\nE)  Formalize Above Action Steps and Goals  At the weekly outplacement\nmeeting on November 29,1995, the model plan identified in \"a)\" above was reviewed.\nThe two ADONs were asked to attend this meeting and will become part of the core\nweekly outplacement meeting team.  Ms. Disu presented her model plans described above\nin Action Step \"b)'\\\nIt was agreed that the formalized plan for implementing the goal of a humane discharge\nplanning process will be the following: (Ms. Disu is writing the notes from this meeting\nwhich will be reviewed by Mr. Butler and formally instituted.  The formalized plan will\nbe presented in the next Status Report.)\n1.  Start at the unit level to sensitize staff.  The ADONs will contact the unit\nclinical nurse coordinators to schedule meetings with Rev. Toeffer and the pastoral team.\nAt all meetings the president of the Residents Council is to be invited and to be\nconsidered a vital part of this team;\n2.  Unit coordinators to collect data on resident concerns to give to the\nADONs social services, Chaplain and pastoral care team, and the Residents Council;\n3.  Initiate counseling for residents including the Residents Council, social\nservices, pastoral care team.\n14\n\nAs of today, November 30, 1995, number one above has commenced.  The formalized\nplan will be in full implementation by December 10. Any residents scheduled for\ndischarge before that date will be immediately assessed and addressed.\n4.  PROFILE AND BRIEF CASE STUDY\nUnit 5B is a particularly touching, sad, and poignant example of systems breakdown,\ncomplacency in viewing residents potential, and passive neglect described in the October\nStatus Report.  Guiding the clinical coordinator, licensed nursing staf£ and the nurse\naides will be a challenge for the newly assigned Associate Director of Nursing\nresponsible for this unit, Ms. Batie Thomas, as well as the new quality assurance and\nstaff development nurses responsible for educating nursing staff on this unit. However,\ncare must improve for these residents in order for DCV to be in compliance with federal\nand District law and regulations and the Court order including humane outplacement\ndischarge plans that reflect the residents full potential.  According to the Nursing Home\nReform Law, residents have a right to maintain and achieve the \"highest practicable\nphysical, mental, and psycho-social well-being.\" On Unit 5B, this is not the case.\nUnit 5B is full of proud, elegant, old women, the majority of whom are for a good deal of\nthe day and week flat on their back, neatly tucked in bed, and incontinent.  For the most\npart these women are aware of their environment.  On numerous occasions when visiting\nthem and at various hours in the evening, they are as awake at 9pm as they are at 6:30pm.\nI ask them what they are thinking, and nearly all talk about their former lives, when they\nwere active, productive, citizens engaged in life. I also ask all the residents: do you know\nDCV is closing, has anyone talked with you about it, do you know where you would like\nto go?  The answers are almost always, no.\n15\n\nI generally find residents at DCV, especially the vulnerable ones who are frail, to be\nstarved for human contact, affection, and touch.  Mr. Donald Bertman, a volunteer\nombudsman and pastoral aide who has been coming to DCV for over twenty-five years\nhas said that to him, \"the biggest problem is not turning people, that is what sticks in my\nmind.\"  Without turning residents, decubitus ulcers develop, incontinence sets in,\ncontractures develop, the body and spirit wither away.  Mr. Bertman's statement is\neloquent in its simplicity and from the Court Monitor's data gathering on the units and at\nthe bedside, one in which I sadly  agree.\nI am sharing the following brief case study as a small example which can be generalized\nto all the residents at DCV.  It demonstrates how as resident can be known as an\nindividual and the potential for this knowledge to be reflected in an individualized,\ninterdisciplinary care plan, improvement in care, attainment of the \"highest practicable\nphysical, mental, and emotional health,\" and an outplacement discharge plan that gives\ndirection to the new providers of care in the receiving facilities.\nThere is a picture on the bedside next to one resident, Ms. M.L.  The picture is of her on\nstage in the Moulin Rouge in Paris in 1917.  Ms. M.L. is now totally contracted.  How\nprofoundly sad for a dancer in her youth to be at the end of her life unable to move her\nlegs.  Contractures occur when no range of motion exercises have been performed and\nonce set in, they are irreversible.  Contractures in a resident are a systems failure and\nmost especially a nursing care failure.  At the outplacement meeting for residents and\ntheir families held Tuesday evening, November 21, 1995,1 met the guardian for Ms. M.L.\nShe told me that Ms. L. Has a fine collection of old books, some dating back to the\n1870's, and likes to be read to.  I have never seen anyone reading to Ms. L.  I doubt the\nstaff knows this piece of data about this human being.  I gleaned this information in one\n16\n\nminute of my conversation with the guardian.  I am sharing this as an example of how\nreally simple it is to get to know the resident, how information which is unique to the\nindividual can be incorporated into an individualized interdisciplinary care plan and in\nturn is invaluable for a new facility to have and know about the human beings they will\nbe receiving and providing a new home.\nAll data gathering, the resultant reflection and improvement in care, and the development\nof meaningful interdisciplinary care plans takes is the priceless commodity identified in\nthe October Status Report to the Court - time, commitment, and caring.\nRecommendations\n(A)  All staff get to know the residents in a way that something meaningful about\nthem can be communicated in the interdisciplinary care plan and shared with the\noutplacement facility.  This of course includes nursing staff, but it especially challenges\nthe Therapeutic Recreation staff to become more meaningfully engaged in the lives of\nresidents, especially those who do not appear to be meaningfully engaged in their\nenvironments, that is the frail, vulnerable bed bound residents.  Depending on the needs\nof the residents, the core staff would be dietary, physical therapy, occupational therapy,\ntherapeutic recreation, nursing.\n(B)  Actively engage the eighteen member therapeutic recreation staff to teach\nnurse aides at the bedside how to stimulate, engage, and provide activities that are unique\nto the individual, for example, reading to the resident as identified above, or listening to\nmusic.\n17\n\n©  A rhetorical question, the answer to which I hope to see in action: What ever\nhappened to the good old therapeutic backrub?\nA nursing home systems expert pro bono consultant to the Court Monitor, toured Unit 5B\nwith me.  This consultant has been in hundreds of nursing homes throughout the country.\nHer assessment was profound and one which I hope will give motivation to immediately\ndevelop and implement the humane discharge planning process.  That is, the \"condition\nresidents are discharged in is the way they will die.\"  The consultant also assessed that\nthe proud, old, elegant women on Unit 5B are \"warehoused.\"\nI am writing this, of course, to inform the Court, but also to hopefully give motivation to\nthe staff to see the world of the resident with a larger vision.  I do believe, if residents do\nnot get the full potential of care they require and deserve while still remaining at DCV,\nthen the outplacement process cannot possibly be humane, which will be a violation of\nfederal and District law and regulations, and the Court Orders.  I know the staff is capable\nof rising to the occasion, and focusing on the unanimous goal of, in the words of Mr.\nSilas Butler, the Deputy Administrator at DCV, \"maintaining the level of care in\noutplacement by upgrading care here (at DCV) before the residents leave.\"  To be sure,\nthis is also a difficult time for the staff, who are faced with loss of their jobs and the\nnecessity of finding new employment.  However, as staff, the primary goal is the best\ninterest of the residents.\nI am using unit 5B as an example, there are similar care situations on all units.  However,\nI want the Court to know that there are also fine examples of improvement in care which\nthe Court Monitor has observed since first entering DCV on August 28,1995.  As Court\nMonitor, I must admit it is a bit frustrating, for I truly believe with the new leadership in\n18\nTTT-«  •  •  MUM—i  r-rr\n\nnursing, with the commitment to professional behavior on the Executive Director and the\nadministration's part, and with the on-going monitoring of the Court, DCV Nursing\nHome could be turned around into a model facility within two years.  However, now with\nthe outplacement process taking place, it is my sincere hope that these leadership energies\nwill be put into developing and implementing a model outplacement plan which will\nbenefit the residents of DCV Nursing Home and also serve as a model to the long term\ncare community of the District of Columbia.\n5.  OUTPLACEMENT OF RESIDENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS\nThis section addresses the special outplacement needs of residents with mental illness,\nincluding assessment and action steps to be implemented by Dr. Mary Alice Crockett, the\nMedical Director, who is charged by Mr. Silas Butler to oversee the outplacement of the\nresidents with mental illness.  The outplacement of the residents with mental retardation\nis addressed in this Report under the July 6, 1995 Stipulated Court Order Section D.\nResidents with Mental Retardation.\nThe assessment data for outplacement of residents with mental illness has been gathered\nfrom the following sources: the Court Monitor's attendance at the three outplacement\nmeetings for residents with mental retardation; discussions with staff of the Commission\nof Mental Health and St. Elizabeth's Hospital; Ms. Corrie Kemp, Chief, Central Referral\nBureau, District of Columbia; meeting with Dr. Sloane, Commissioner of Public Health,\nDistrict of Columbia; meetings with social workers; staff on Unit b where many of the\nresidents with mental illness live; conversations with the Bazelon Center for Mental\nHealth Law; interviews with the members of the Dixon Committee and the Monitor for\nthe Dixon committee; meeting with Dr. Donna Mauch, Special Master, Dixon\n19\n\ncommission; review of the Dixon committee reports of the last several years; discussions\nwith the D.C. Long Term Care Ombuds persons; discussions with mental health experts\nat the Mental Health Policy Resource Center; meetings with Dr. Mary Alice Crockett,\nMedical Director, DCV; discussions with Mr. Silas Butler, Deputy Administrator, DCV;\nobservations of and interview with the residents.\nAssessment Data\nAll the assessment data described above regarding the discharge outplacement process\napplies here to the outplacement planning process for residents with mental illness.\nHowever, there are critical and unique concerns which apply to this special population\nwhich primarily relate to the November 7, 1995, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of\nJuly 6, 1995 in the areas of monitoring:\n\"all residents are transferred to appropriate residences which meet their\nindividual needs  and\nD. review whether all necessary services and support have been arranged and\nare ready to be provided at the new residence.\"\n-  there is a lack of consensus on the best assessments to use for residents with\nmental illness to determine the most appropriate outplacement;\n- No one knows exactly how many residents there are at DCV with mental illness\neither as a primary diagnosis or as a secondary condition, some estimate there are 80\nresidents.  However, as a result of the weekly outplacement meeting of Wednesday,\nNovember 29, the ADONs will gather data from the units on the number and names of\nresidents identified by staff with behavioral symptoms;\n- some residents with mental illness are inappropriately exempted from further\npsychiatric assessments as mandated by law (PASAR).  The reasons given are medical\nconditions which do not qualify for exemption;\n20\n\n- there are not sufficient and appropriate residences, resources, services and\nsupports in place for the outplacement of residents with mental illness;\n- despite years of existence, the Dixon commission has been unable to develop\nappropriate community living situations;\n- there are at least 100 residents of DCV who will be extremely difficult to place,\nmany of whom have some form of behavioral symptoms.\n- according to administration at DCV, DCV has funding through the end of 1996.\nAction Steps\nImmediate remedies are needed.  The Court Monitor will closely oversee the following\naction steps to be implemented by Dr. Crockett or whomever Mr. Butler identifies.\n(A)  Focus Group  A Focus group will be formed for the following purposes:\n1.  Validate assessments and appropriateness of recommendations for type\nof outplacement sites currently being conducted by a three person team from St.\nElizabeth's and the Commission of Mental Health.  The members of the focus group team\nwill as much as possible be drawn from local experts within the Washington, DC area,\nincluding the National Institutes of Mental Health.\n2.  Identify potential appropriate outplacement sites.\n(B)  Consultant Team  A consultant team will be identified to provide on-going\nspecialty services to outplacement sites.  It is generally agreed by most all those listed\nabove from whom assessment data was gathered, that the only way nursing homes or\nother community based sites will accept residents exhibiting behavioral symptoms is to\nprovide an on-going specialty consultant team.  This team would be available to advise\noutplacement facility staff on the proper care, interventions, prevention strategies,\nenvironmental conditions suitable to the special needs of residents with mental illness or\n21\nTT\n\nexhibiting behavioral symptoms, and would be available on an emergency basis.  The\ncomposition of this team should consist of a psychiatrist, psychologist, geriatric-\npsychiatric nurse, and when appropriate, a recreation specialist and social worker.  This\nwould provide for the \"necessary services and support\" outlined in the November 7 Court\nOrder.\n©  Home and Community Based Waiver  Given the fact that the District of\nColumbia is the only jurisdiction in the country that does not have a home and\ncommunity based waiver for care as an alternative to nursing homes and institutional\ncare, and given the fact that DCV is funded until the end of 1996 (according to DCV\nadministration), a home and community based waiver will be proposed.  Dr. Donna\nMauch, Special Master for the Dixon commission has agreed to assist the Court Monitor\ndevelop a proposal to be submitted in a future Status Report to the Court.\nThe need is immediate to find appropriate residences with appropriate support services\nand knowledgeable staff with access to a consultant team to care for this population of\nhard to place residents.  In order for Dr. Mauch to be able to assist the Court Monitor, the\nAnnual Costs Reports for DCV and the Budget for DCV is required to develop this\nproposal.\nREQUEST TO THE COURT\nGiven the fact that the Court Monitor has still not received the list of vendor phone\nnumbers requested in the October Status Report as a Request to the Court to advise the\nCorporation Counsel on behalf of the District of Columbia, and therefore, the Court\nMonitor is unable to fully monitor vendor payments, I hereby respectfully request that\nthe Court Order the Corporation Counsel on behalf of the District of Columbia to\n22\n\nsupply the Court Monitor immediately with the Annual Cost Reports and the Budget for\nD.C. Village Nursing Home.\nn.  UPDATE OF SYSTEMS\nThe October Status Report is recent and still current.  Only those areas where there is a\nsignificant change in status will be profiled.\nA.  Medicine\nOn October 26, 1995, Dr. Harvey Sloane, Commissioner of Public Health for the District\nof Columbia conducted a meeting at DCV to discuss the Department of Medicine and the\nOctober 20 Status Hearing in the Court.\nPresent were Dr. Sloane, Mr. Garland Pinkston and Ms. Barbara Mann, Corporation\nCounsel for the District of Columbia; Mr. Louis Norman and Ms. Frankie Wheeler,\nOffice of Personnel, District of Columbia; Ms. Lori Taylor-Hayes, labor attorney, District\nof Columbia; Ms. Gladys Fountain, Interim Administrator for Long Term Care, District\nof Columbia; Ms. Alberta Brasfield, Executive Director, DCV; Dr. Mary Alice Crockett,\nMedical Director, DCV; Drs. Phan, Nyguen, and Allin, medical staff, DCV; Mr. Curmet\nForte, President, Residents' Council, DCV; Dr. Adrian Wilson (dentist), president of the\nDoctors Council, and the Court Monitor.\nThe purpose of the meeting was to discuss the medical staff functioning and \"cooperating\nwithin the structure at DCV\" as Mr. Pinkston stated in an attempt to set a constructive\n23\nTT\n\ntone for the meeting.  However, after an hour and a half, it became clear to Dr. Sloane,\nthat there was no willingness on the part of two of the medical staff and the Doctors\nCouncil President to follow the Request to the Court in the October Status Report and\nreport directly to the Medical Director in all matters relating to resident care and to\nfollow the Medical Director's suggestions for continuing education.  Dr. Sloane ended the\nmeeting indicating he would make his own decision on resolving the problem.  As of the\nend of November, the psychiatrist and one medical staff  have been detailed to other\npositions within the District of Columbia.\nWhat saddened me most about this meeting was that the best interest of the residents was\nnever the focus of the discussion from the Doctors Council, and that there was no\nindication of a willingness to entertain or heed the recommendations of the Court.  The\nDoctors Council president  exhibited an arcane view of health care delivery and certainly\nno knowledge of the Tninimnm standards of care for nursing home residents.\nCoincidentally, the most recent edition ofWashington City Paper, November 24, 1995, has a\nfront page cover story on the District of Columbia's public employee unions profiling the drain\nthey are on the District.  The first union profiled is the Doctors Council.  The article describes the\npresident of the Doctors Council as defending the indefensible.\nA fee for service physician is covering the units previously covered by the departing medical staff.\nThe Medical Director has supplied and made available necessary materials including the federal\nregulations for minimum standards of practice in nursing homes and current literature on\ntreatment trends.  Psychiatric services are to be arranged.\nB.  Nursing\n24\nTW\n\nTwo Associate Directors of Nursing (ADONs) have been assigned with one ADON\nresponsible for Units 2A, 2B, 3 A, 3B and the other ADON responsible for the care on\nUnits 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B. In addition a contract is in place with National Nurses to provide\n16 FTE licensed staff to be permanently assigned to DCV.  Three nurses are assigned as\nclinical coordinators on the units to replace nurses who have left DCV employ.  Also now\nthere are two  supervisors during the evening and night shifts.  This should help\naccelerate the needed supervision at the unit level.  The two ADONS have offices on their\nunits. From this contingent of permanent assignments from National Nurses, there are\nnow in place two teams consisting of a staff development nurse and a quality assurance\nnurse with responsibility for training at the unit levels, one team for the Units 2 and 3 and\nthe other team for the Units 4 and 5.  I see much more training of staff.  I also see\nleadership behaviors on the unit level.\nC.  Infection Control\nInfection control is still very weak.  The missing link is still no systematic and immediate\nfollow-up when patterns emerge.  I strongly recommend that one staff person be\ndesignated with responsibility for all aspects of infection control.  Currently the staff\nperson with jurisdiction for infection control does not have clear lines of authority for\nfollow up inservice education.  And, as quality assurance coordinator spends a good deal\nof her time compiling the '30 Day Compliance Report' as opposed to needed follow-up\non the Units.\nHL  STIPULATED COURT ORDER. July 6,1995\n25\n\nThe October Status Report is recent and still current.  Only those areas where there is a\nsignificant change in status will be elaborated on in this Status Report.\nA. Medical and Nursing Care\n1.  Care of Decubitus Ulcers\na.  Defendants shall immediately cease the use of Elase and Intrasite gel\ninappropriately for treatment of decubitus ulcers.\nb.  Defendants shall immediately ensure that all DCV residents receive\nappropriate and adequate preventive medical and nursing care and timely treatment\nfor decubitus ulcers and/or other skin breakdown sufficient to maintain their good\nhealth.  To this end, Defendants shall assess all residents for risk of skin breakdown\nwithin two days from the date of entry of this Stipulated Order, and shall develop\nand implement within twenty days thereafter, for each resident identified as at risk, a\ntreatment plan fully adequate to prevent skin breakdown and/or to treat existing skin\nbreakdown.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nTreatment nurses now cover weekend day shifts.  However, I still do not see routine skin\ncare checks on the units by the staff.  I know the ADONs are working to this goal, but it\nhas not yet reached the bedside on a consistent level.  Coordinated interdisciplinary care\nfor prevention and treatment of decubitus ulcers has begun, it is still not routine.  Dietary\nmust become more involved in advocating for improvement in nutritional status of those\nresidents with and prone to decubitus ulcers. In recent weeks, decubitus ulcers on Units 4\nand 5 have decreased markedly.  Patterns will be studied for Units 2 and 3.\nCare of Incontinent Residents\n26\n\nDefendants shall immediately ensure that all incontinent DCV residents\nreceive appropriate, adequate and timely nursing care in accordance with generally\naccepted nursing standards.  For residents who have been identified as subject to\nbecoming incontinent, nursing staff shall make rounds to check on their individual\ncondition at least once every two hours.  Nursing staff shall take all appropriate steps\nto care for and clean those residents who need nursing attention due to their\nincontinence.  Nursing staff shall take special care to clean and treat ulcerated areas\nthat may have become soiled due to incontinence.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nRestorative bowel and bladder programs have been instituted on each unit.  Ms. Disu,\nADON has been instrumental in establishing restorative programs.  However, on\nnumerous occasions I have seen toileting programs checked as having occurred every two\nhours when in fact residents have been up in wheelchairs all day.\nI respectfully request that those compiling the '30 Day Compliance Report' cease\nincluding the position charts.  They should be collected but kept with the unit\ncoordinators.  What would be a much more effective method of accountability is for the\nunit coordinators to document rounds they make to check for incontinence and\npositioning and to document interventions with staff when care is compromised with\ninaccurate charting.  I still find numerous instances where residents are in the same\nposition for hours, sometimes incontinent, most all contracted.  In other facilities, staff\nwho routinely indicate care given when it is not are terminated.\n3.  Adequate and Appropriate Nursing Staff\na.  Defendants shall ensure that continuity of nursing staff is maintained\nto the maximum extent feasible during all shifts, seven days a week, on all DCV living\nunits.\n27\n\nb.  By no later than January 1,1996, Defendants shall ensure that there\nis a sufficient permanent nursing staff at DCV to ensure that DCV does not routinely\nrely on contract nurses. Nothing herein prevents the use of contract nurses in\nemergency situations or to ensure that adequate nursing staff is available to Care for\nDCV residents.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nThe rationale for staffing patterns seems to be a mystery.  The numbers in the '30 Day\nCompliance Report' are meaningless unless the census for each unit is given.  There\nshould be an overall rationale for staffing patterns in the nursing office.  Staffing appears\nto be done for the convenience of staff not resident care needs. A nursing home systems\nexpert consultant to the Court Monitor will develop an analysis DCV staffing patterns for\na future status report.  To date, I have still not seen a shortage of actual staff, shortage in\ncare given has been the problem.  I do anticipate potential staffing shortages as the\nfacility moves closer to closing.\nThere are six contract nurse staff vendors DCV relies on, all are owed vendor payments,\nwith some threatening to terminate services by the end of the month.\n4.  Medication Errors\na.  Defendants shall ensure, within fifteen days from the date of entry of\nthis Stipulated Order, that all nursing staff on duty are trained in proper medication\nadministration practices,  and are adequately in serviced on and/or are sufficiently\naware of the individual needs of the residents to whom they are administering\nmedications.\nb.  Defendants shall ensure, within fifteen days from the date of entry of\nthis Stipulated Order, that all medication errors are recorded, that adequate\nprocedures are established to track all medication errors, that any causes for\nmedication errors are identified and remedied, and that any other needed corrective\n28\n\naction is taken in a timely manner to minimize medication error risk to the DCV\nresidents.\nA nursing home systems expert consultant to the Court Monitor will gather data on a\nregular basis commencing Sunday, December 3.\nB.  Measures Needed to Remedy Shortages\n1.  Food and Drink\nDefendants shall immediately ensure that sufficient supplies of\nnutritious and appropriate food and drink are consistently maintained at DCV and\nthat each resident daily receives adequate, well-balanced, nutritious and appropriate\nfood and drink according to their individual nutritional needs.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Dangerously close to Non-Compliance this week\nOn Monday, November 27, DCV had a one day supply of vegetables and bread.  This is\nan intolerable scenario that should never have escalated to the final day of basic nutrient\nsupplies for frail, fragile, medically compromised individuals, the residents of DCV.\nThe head of the dietary department appropriately requested purchase orders at the\nbeginning of October.  On Wednesday, November 22, the Court Monitor through an\ninterview with the head of dietary was able, with difficulty, to get information from Ms.\nCostley that purchase orders were not received from the procurement office.  And, that in\nfact if not received by the following Monday, dietary would be out of supplies of\nvegetables, bread, fish, and margarine.\nIt is amazing to me that the dietary department chief did not advocate for the residents\nand communicate her lack of receipt of the purchase orders in a timely manner to the\nexecutive director.  It is also intolerable that the procurement office, Ms. Perkins, was not\n29\n\nforthcoming with the necessary purchase orders.  To me this represents a callous\ndisregard for the welfare of the residents of DCV.  What is most stupefying of all, is that\npart of the evidence gathered through affidavits which lead to the legal action resulting in\nthe Stipulated Court Order of July 6, 1995, is precisely the fact that basic nutrients were\nnot available to residents.\nThe presence of the Court at DCV was able to prevent a repeat of the scenarios leading to\nthe Court Order.  Purchase orders were received and vendors contacted and supplies\ndelivered.  However, in order for the scenario described above not to repeat, that is, so\nthat basic food and nutrients do not become dangerously close to depletion, the Chief of\nthe Dietary department:\n-  will submit to the Executive Director with a copy for the Court Monitor\nbiweekly listings of outstanding purchase orders, identifying items required and dates\nexisting supplies will end;\n-  must exhibit leadership behavior by advocating for the needs of her department\nfor the best interests of the residents.  Passivity is not appropriate.\nCoincidentally, on radio and television news, Monday evening and Tuesday morning,\nNovember 27 and 28, lack of food supplies such as vegetables at DCV was mentioned.\nApparently, though, these broadcasts were an amazing coincidence.  The Long Term Care\nOmbuds office has said that the source of this story was the president of the D.C. Health\nCare Association.  That in a conversation with the television new reporter, he in general\nterms discussed the difficulty of vendor payments in the District and the impact on care\ngiving, citing the affidavits referred to above.\n30\n\nHoward University, Department of Nutritional Sciences has committed to the Court\nMomtor to perform the necessary assessments of supplies and nutrients, and adequacy of\nnutrition.\nThe following information on the diets submitted in the '30 Day Compliance Report'\nwas supplied to the Court Monitor by the nutritionist for the Georgetown University\nChild Development Center, Dr. Golda Downer.\n- The therapeutic value of the calorie diets, such as, 1200, 1500, and 1800 calories\nare impossible to judge without portions, which are not listed.\n- The diet listed as high fiber in fact supplies an average amount of fiber intake,\nnot high.\n- The low sodium diet is too high in cholesterol.\nThe dietician from the Health Care Financing Surveyors (HCF) team in the exit\nconference on September 30, 1995, stated that DCV has more specialized diets, seven,\nthan most nursing homes in the country.  The fact of the matter is that residents have\naccess to the canteens and vending machines and are free to add to any restrictions\nimposed by specialized diets.\n2.  Medications, Medical Supplies and Equipment\na.  Defendants shall ensure that adequate and appropriate supplies of\nnecessary medications, that meet the individual needs of the DCV residents, are\nconsistently maintained at DCV no later than two days from the date of entry of this\nStipulated Order.\nA geriatric-pharmacologist expert consultant to the Court Monitor will supply data for\nthis section.\n31\n\nc  Defendants shall maintain the plumbing and heating system at DCV\nto ensure that adequate amounts of hot water, at safe temperatures, are available for\nuse by residents within two days from the date of entry of this Stipulated Order.\nDefendants shall also ensure that there is sufficient hot water to properly sanitize and\nclean eating utensils, plates and meal-related items.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Compliance\n3.  Personal Care Items\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\nI want the Court and the District of Columbia to know that Georgetown University\nSchool of Nursing is committed to community service in the District and has chosen to\nassist the Court Monitor at DCV.  This is a tribute to the leadership of the Dean of the\nSchool of Nursing at Georgetown, Dr. Elaine Larson.  It is also a tribute to the faculty\nmember who is the Court Monitor's nursing homes system expert consultant, Dr. Sharon\nMailey, a geriatric nurse practitioner and a former director of nursing in two nursing\nhomes in the South.  It is also a wonderful tribute to volunteers from the School of\nNursing who have devoted their free time on weekends, under Dr. Mailey's and the Court\nMonitor's supervision, to collect the data for this section.\nOn Saturday, November 18, data on personal care items were gathered on Units 5A, 5B,\n4A, 4B, and 3A, from 137 residents rooms.  A check off list was developed by\nGeorgetown for the following items: toothbrush, toothpaste, comb/brush, soap, lotion,\ndeodorant, wash basin, water pitcher, cup, cup with water, water accessible to resident\narm ban ID, denture cup, shaving equipment.\n32\n\nThe majority of  items were present.  Lotion was not present in over half of the residents\nrooms, which relates to the rhetorical question in section I. of this report, where are the\nbackrubs?  There are two items that were not present which is an alanning finding and\ndirectly relates to this Court Order in the areas decubitus ulcers, incontinence, and\nnutrition.  That is in nearly all the rooms there were no cups with water and water was\nnot accessible to the resident, cups were not present in over half of the rooms.\nHospitalizations for dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and the development of infections\nare no accident given this data.  This data also supports the identified weakness in\nInfection Control profiled above under the Systems update and described in the October\nStatus Report, and gives direction for immediate staff development.\nOn this same day, a nurse/attorney pro bono consultant to the Court Monitor reviewed the\nchart of a resident who recently died and was listed in the '30 Day Compliance Report',\nMr. M.D.  The primary finding was that there was no record of intake and output, that is\nno record of hydration.\nC.  Payment of Vendors\nI regret to inform the Court, that my request to the Court in the October Status Report has\ngone unheeded.  It was my understanding that the Corporation Counsel had the power\nand authority of its office to counsel their clients to perform in the best interests of the\nresidents.  It is my hope that the Corporation Counsel assumes the power and authority of\ntheir office and wrestle the list of vendor phone numbers from which ever bureaucrat has\nit.  Having these numbers directly relates to residents quality of life, for I am unable to\ndetermine how close services may be to termination for lack of payment.\n33\n\nAn example is the dietary services described above in B. 1. Food and Drink.  Purchase\norders are now in place for needed nutrients, but I was unable to monitor the logical next\nstep, and that is to detennine if vendors were in fact going to deliver the needed supplies\nfor the residents health and safety.\nThe following is data I do have.\nStatus Re: Court Order  As of November 30, 1995, Non-Compliance\nNurse Staffing Vendors\nPremier Nurse Staffing, Inc., formerly SAT, owed over $55,000 over 45 days\noutstanding.\nWill terminate services December 1, 1995.\nCUP Health Care Services owed $106, 027.  Will terminate services November 30.\nNational Nurses owed $79,193. Will terminate services December 1.\nAMC owed $40,215.\nPhysical Therapist\nTherapeutic Management Services (TMS) owed $25,380.  The physical therapist came on\nduty on September 5, 1995.  TMS contract expires December 29, 1995. Will terminate\nservices December 11.\nD.  Services for Individuals with Mental Retardation\n34\nTT\n\n1.  Defendants shall place all DCV residents with mental retardation in\nappropriate community-based residential and day programs which fully meet their\nindividual needs as identified by appropriate interdisciplinary assessments, no later\nthan October 31,1995.  Defendants shall ensure that the placements are adequate to\nmeet each individual's needs.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Non-Compliance\nSince the submission of the October Status Report three residents with mental retardation\nhave been discharged.  Two residents Ms. P. A. and Ms. D.L were discharged to\nWholistic Health Services.  One resident, Mr. L.S. described in the Assessment Data of\nthe outplacement process in section I. above was discharged from DCV to the Greater\nSoutheast Hospital and then to Washington Nursing Facility, where he is waiting\nplacement to D.C. Family Services.  There are twelve residents with mental retardation\ncurrently at DCV.\nCARECO an identified site for five residents is no longer a proposed outplacement site.\nPhysical plant renovations required, such as, installing sprinkles were not acceptable\noption as well as the reimbursement rate proposed.\nSymbral Foundation was identified as a possible replacement site and visited DCV.  On\nNovember 8, the Court Monitor sat in on the meeting with the Symbral representatives\nand Mr. Richard Clevenger, program coordinator for GUCDC and Mr. Silas Butler.  Mr.\nClevenger reviewed the Individual Habilitation Plans and then Symbral toured Unit 5 A,\nwhere the residents with mental retardation live. Symbral had no staff in their proposed\nfacility.  The Court Monitor asked how staff were acquired, and was told, through\nadvertisement in the newspaper, local colleges and universities, and networking.  As of\nNovember 27, Symbral Foundation is no longer a possible outplacement site.  The\nDistrict of Columbia ARC, the Court Monitor for the Pratt decree raised serious concerns\n35\n\nwith Mr. Butler the Court Monitor and the Ombuds about Symbral's ability to be\nfinancially solvent and train and maintain staff to care for the residents.\nKennedy Institute a proposed outplacement site for four residents with mental retardation\nhas gone on record protesting their rate assignment and the fact that they are owed\n$203,504 for Fiscal Years 1988-1993. Kennedy Institute has threatened to withdraw their\nproposal to provide services on December 8, 1995. The Court Monitor is scheduled to\nvisit Kennedy Institute.\nThe remaining group homes, Metro, D.C. Family Services, and Wholistic are appealing\ntheir rate designation by the Commission on Health Care Finance.\nThree residents originally designated for assignment to group homes, Ms. A.B., Ms.\nC.W., and Ms. C.L. are designated to be outplaced to nursing homes because of then-\nserious medical problems and nursing care needs.  Although no homes are identified.\nAs of this writing, November 30, no residents are scheduled to be outplaced and in fact if\nKennedy does withdraw, there will be no identified outplacement sites for any of the\nremaining 12 residents.  If Kennedy Institute does not withdraw its proposal to provide\nservices, then there will be no identified outplacement sites for eight, including the three\nresidents needing nursing home care.\nMy concerns regarding the outplacement of residents with mental retardation are the\nsame  concerns listed in the October Status Report.  I see similar issues in the\noutplacement of residents with mental retardation as raised in the Outplacement of\nResidents with Mental Illness in section I. of this Report.  I remain particularly concerned\n36\n\nabout the on-going demonstration of competency of the caregivers in the receiving\nfacilities and homes.  This major concern is based on the following assessment data:\n-  According to the Court Monitor for the Pratt decree, the staff at Wholistic\nHealth Services refused to come to DCV to be trained by Georgetown University Child\nDevelopment Center.\n- Three residents with mental retardation outplaced to D.C. Family Services on\nJune 30, 1995, although before the filing of this Court Order on July 6, were observed\noutside during the day: one resident was in pajamas on and no shoes; one resident\ndisheveled and dirty; and the third resident's diaper was changed in public.  One resident\nMr. L.S. is scheduled to be outplaced to this facility.\n- This same resident Mr. L.S. profiled earlier in this Report was transferred to the\nhospital and from there discharged to a nursing home in restraints.  To me this is a\nsystems failure, and that the appropriate people who know Mr. L.S. were not involved in\ninforming caregivers of his needs.\n-1 was very concerned to learn that a potential group home did not have caregivers\nin place and in fact did not know who they would get, described above under Symbral.\nThis speaks to the 1970's and early 1980's which led to the Nursing Home Reform Law\nand the minimnm requirements for nurse aide training and on-going continuing education,\nas well as requirements for licensure and continuing education for administrators, and a\nstronger role for surveyors to help ensure quality.\n- In a telephone conversation on November 17 with Dr. Richard Birkel, President\nof the Kennedy Institute, Dr. Birkel identified a need for a plan for continuity of care and\noversight of caregivers.  He sees this oversight in the DCV instance coming from the\nGUCDC as the primary caregivers to residents with mental retardation.  Dr. Birkel\nbelieves that this will afford an opportunity to correct and shape staff behaviors in the\nreceiving facilities.  Dr. Birkel sees a need for oversight at least once a week for several\n37\n\nmonths and then gradually taper off.  Dr. Birkel believes an outplacing facility cannot\nassume that residents will get care required unless these safeguards are in place.  Dr.\nBirkel said he would feel better about receiving DCV residents if he knew he had access\nto on-going support for these residents care needs.\n- Dr. Birkel and Ms. Darlene Nipper, Director, Division of Residential Services at\nthe Kennedy Institute, feel that the remaining residents with mental retardation at DCV\nare among the most fragile-medically of  residents in group homes in the District of\nColumbia.  Ms. Nipper believes that if the above described consultation services are not\navailable to group home providers, then the special care needs identified in the Individual\nHabitation Plans will not be met.\n- In an interview with Dr. Golda Downer, the nutritionist for the GUCDC, Dr.\nDowner corroborated the statements of the Kennedy Institute experts.  Dr. Downer\nbelieves that none of the caregivers in the group homes have experience with residents\nwith dysphagia, which all the residents with mental retardation at DCV have.  Dysphagia\nis an inability to chew and swallow on one's own, and it is neurologicalry based.  Dr.\nDowner believes caregivers need training in food preparation and feeding and positioning\nbefore during and after meals.  These residents are at great risk of aspiration pneumonia\nand death with each meal feeding.  On-going consultation and supervision is vital until\ncompetency is demonstrated.\n-1 have observed staff at DCV during evenings and weekends when GUCDC is\nnot present, who are not properly positioning residents.\n-1 believe GUCDC needs to be more active in the discharge planning process for\nresidents with mental retardation and more proactive in assuring their needs are met in the\ncommunity.\n- Mr. Silas Butler of DCV as well as Ms, Corrie Kemp, Chief, Central Referral\nBureau for the District of Columbia believe that a guarantee of an on-going consultation\n38\n\nspecialty team would make outplacement more appropriate to residents needs and\nproviders concerns, and that even nursing homes unwilling to take the three residents\nidentified above may be more assured and inclined to do so.\n- Mr. Butler believes that a small core team of specialty consultants, consisting of\nnutritionist psychologist speech pathologist and recreation specialist preferably from\nGeorgetown, where there would be access to specialty clinics is a model necessary for the\nappropriate outplacement of the remaining 12 residents with mental retardation at DCV.\nMr. Butler is in conversations about this team plan with Mr. Hubbard at Mental\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities Administration (MRDDA), District of\nColumbia.\n-1 believe the model for a consultation team to serve as a resource to outplacement\nsites at the residents new homes, identified in the Outplacement of Residents with Mental\nIllness section of this Report, would be appropriate for this population as well.\nRecommendations\n1) I therefore, recommend, the identification, development and implementation with all\npossible haste of a specialty consult team to serve as a resource to facilities and homes\nreceiving DCV residents with mental retardation, to evaluate, train, serve, as resource to\nreceiving facilities until staff is stabilized and competency is demonstrated.\n2) GUCDC must become more proactive and actively involved in the discharge planning\nprocess for residents with mental retardation at DCV.\n2. Defendants shall ensure uninterrupted clinical services, habilitation, and\nother services to all DCV residents with mental retardation.  Such services shall\nremain in effect until all DCV residents with mental retardation are outplaced into\nappropriate community settings in accordance with the above provision.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Partial Compliance\n39\n-i—wr\n\nWhile GUCDC is present there is compliance.  However, on numerous occasions on\nevenings and weekends, I have observed residents not engaged, in bed, and some\npositioned incorrectly as described above.\n3.  No individuals with mental retardation shall be admitted to DCV in\nthe future except where this Court specifically approves the proposed admission.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Full Compliance\n40",

FIELDS, Ed., R.N.\n#604\n1722 19th Street, N.W.\nWashington, DC  20009\nMessage: (202) 234-7142\nDecember 6, 1995\nThe Honorable Thomas F. Hogan\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Avenue, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC  20001\nRe:  Court Order The United  States of America v.  The\nDistrict of Columbia, et al., Civ. No. 95-948, TFH, D.C. Village\nNursing Home (DCV);\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July\n6, 1995.\nDear Judge Hogan:\nI am writing to inform you of a situation relating to vendor\npayment at DCV which is having a direct impact on the operations\nof administration and the nursing department in terms of the\namount of time spent trying to put corrective systems in place.\nIf this situation continues, there will be a direct negative\nimpact on resident care by Sunday.\nThe situation is the following.  National Nurses, Inc. is among\nthe many vendors who have not been paid within\n\"forty-five  days  from  the  date  of  a  legitimate  invoice  is\nreceived.\"  Stipulated Order. July 6, 1995.\nAs a consequence, as of  11pm last night and again tonight,\nNational  Nurses  has  threatened  to withdraw  their services.\nThus, the District of Columbia would be out of compliance with\n\"needed goods and/or services procured for the benefit of the\nDCV residents shall not be terminated due to...non-payment or\ndelinquent  payment of...vendors.\"  Stipulated Order. July 6,\n1995.\nNational  is  a particularly  important  vendor.  DCV  has  two\ncontracts with National, one is for as needed staffing, which\nwill  only  increase as more  DCV employees  leave relating  to\nclosing.  The second contract, implemented in the beginning of\nOctober with another phase in on November 6, is for management\nlevel nurses.\n\nThis  second  contract  provides  for  the  16  FTE  permanently\nassigned  nurses  to  serve  as  replacement  unit  clinical\ncoordinators on three of the units where DCV employees have\nleft.  In  addition,  this  second  contract  provides  for the\npermanently assigned quality assurance and staff development\neducation personnel to work at the unit level in conjunction\nwith the two Associate Directors of Nursing (ADONs) . It is this\nactivity that is so critically needed for continuity of care,\nimprovement  in  care,  development  of  the  interdisciplinary\ndischarge care plans described in the Monitor's November Status\nReport,  and  required  under  federal  and  District  law  and\nregulations and the Court Orders.\nUnder the first contract, National supplies within a twenty-four\nhour period, five to six nurses for the evening and night shifts\ncombined.  Coverage  for  these  positions  has  been  arranged\nthrough other contract nurse staffing vendors through Saturday.\nHowever, as of Sunday, December 10, 1995, the nursing department\nprojects  much  difficulty  filling  these  slots  with  other\nvendors, who have also not been paid.  It is non-payment of this\nfirst contract that is out of compliance.\nThe Court Monitor, late this afternoon, was able to convince Mr.\nRonald  Messenheimer,  President  of  National  Nurses,  not  to\nwithdraw  .the  services  of  the  management  nurses,  since\ntechnically the payment of their invoices is not yet out of\ncompliance.  Of  course,  it  is  certainly  within  Mr.\nMessenheimer's business prerogative to do so.\nIt  is my  understanding  from  Ms.  Gladys  Fountain,  Interim-\nAdministrator for Long Term Care, Commission of Public Health,\nDistrict of Columbia, from information she received from Janette\nMichaels,  Consent  Decree  Coordinator  for  the  District  of\nColumbia, that as of late this afternoon, Mr. Garland Pinkston\nof the Office of the Corporation Counsel will hand deliver a\nvoucher for payment to Mr. Williams, the Chief Financial Officer\nfor the District of Columbia.\nAs  of 7:30pm this  evening, the vice-president  for National\nNurses, Inc., Mr. Grant, has told me that they will continue to\nprovide services tonight, but the payment situation must be\nresolved tomorrow morning or the threat to withdraw all staff\nwill occur.\nThe scenario described above must not be allowed to occur month\nafter  month,  the  residents  are  coming  painfully  close  to\nsuffering.\nI want to briefly share another lack of payment example and how\npitifully  it has  affected  one resident, Mr. L.R.  It  also\nprovides another example of how critical the vendor payment list\nwith phone numbers is to the Court Monitor in order to help\nprevent needless violation of residents rights and needless pain\n\nand suffering of the frailest of District of Columbia residents.\nMr. L.R., a young man, is a total quadriplegic.  That is he has\nno use of his arms or legs. . He also has complete use of his\nmind.  Mr. L.R. has been in bed for a month because the right\nfoot rest of his wheelchair is broken.  The physical therapy\ndepartment has not been able to get a response from the vendor\nwhich  repairs  wheelchairs,  Rehabilitation  Equipment\nProfessionals  (REP).  The Court Monitor spoke with the vendor\ntoday and was informed by REP that they have an outstanding bill\nfor payment for repair to Mr. L.R.'s wheelchair of $587.50 from\nApril 27, 1995.  It is my hope that by reading this, the able-\nbodied decision makers of District will be shamed into improving\nthe life of the able-minded artist, who is imprisoned in his bed\nbecause of this negligence.\nThe payment to these two vendors, especially National Nurses,\nwill be closely monitored, and the Court Monitor will inform the\nCourt on a daily basis of progress.\nOnce again, Judge Hogan, it is a privilege to serve the Court\nand to work with all concerned parties for the best interests of\nthe long term care residents of the District of Columbia.\nSincerely',\nHarriet A.

Hogan\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Avenue, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC  20001\nRe:  Court Order The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et al.,\nCiv. No. 95-948, TFH, D.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV);\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6, 1995\nDear Judge Hogan:\nI am writing the Court now, before the next Status Hearing in January, because of four areas\nof concern which must be addressed immediately.  I am also in this letter to the Court,\nrecommending further data gathering and remedies to rectify what I have now identified as\npatterns detrimental to residents well-being.\nThe four areas I will address are the following:  (1) update on Mr. L.R. profiled in my\nDecember 6, 1995, letter to the Court; (2) the process of procuring  purchase orders for\nvendor services, whereby there is now no stock of  normal saline used as a treatment\nmodality for decubitus ulcers; (3) chronic non-compliance of payment of vendors, whereby\nthere is now no duoderm  in house for treatment of decubitus ulcers and no payment to\nNational Nurses profiled in the Court Monitor's December 6,1995, letter to the Court; (4)\nresidents' being denied their own funds from their Personal Needs Allowance (PNA).\nEach of these four areas are indicative to me of a common thread of similar patterns.  These\npatterns are what I believe to be a misuse of government funds, passivity and lack of\nadvocacy on the part of staff for residents' needs and the acceptance of the bureaucratic\ninertia described in the Court Monitor's October Status Report under C. Payment of Vendors\n(p.  22), and needless  and unconscionable  delays in issuing purchase  orders from the\nProcurement Office of the Department of Human Services, District of Columbia.\nA description of these patterns in action is profiled in the Court Monitor's November Status\n\nReport under IE. Stipulated Court Order. July 6,1995, B. Measures to Remedy Shortages.\n1. Food and Drink (pp. 29-31.)\nHowever, I want to assure the Court, there are some staff who are true advocates for\nresidents rights.  The two Associate Directors of Nursing (ADONs) are implementing\nproactive  steps  to  improve  the  standard  of  practice  and  care  and  are  also  openly,\nconstructively, and professionally implementing the Court Monitor's recommendations.\nEach of the four areas listed above will be profiled.  At the end of the profiles will be\nrecommendations and remedies needed to rectify the patterns reflected in all the areas\nprofiled.\n(1)  Update on Mr. L.R. profiled in December 6. 1995 letter to the Court\nOn December 8, 1995, Mr. L.R. was out of bed and up in his wheelchair and resumed\nhis usual place at the entrance to DCV, where there is day light, activity, and other human\ncontact  Mr. L.R.S situation reveals a pattern of passivity on the part of the staff and also a\nnon payment of vendor problem.\nThe internal problem revealed by this resident scenario is the following.  To be sure, the\nnursing staff did contact physical therapy when Mr. L.R. 's wheelchair first broke.  However,\na systems failure set in whereby no one rectified the problem until the Court Monitor was\nnotified by the ombuds person and the President of the Residents' Council, immediately\nstepped in and called the physical therapy department and the wheelchair repair vendor, and\nalerted the Court.  Daily rounds by nursing and administration would have uncovered this\nnegligence.\nThe external problem revealed by this scenario is that a previous repair to Mr. L.R.'s\nwheelchair has gone unpaid since April, 27th of this year and the vendor was unwilling to\nservice DCV again as a result of this neglect in payment.\nNot maintaining resident equipment is a violation of federal regulations and the Court\nOrders.\n(2) Process of Procuring Purchase Orders (P.O.) for Vendor Services\nLast week at the time of writing of the Court Monitor's November 30 Status Report\nto the Court, mis problem was reflected in a shortage of food supplies to the residents.  This\nweek mis problem is reflected in an inadequate supply on hand of treatment modalities for\ndecubitus ulcers, specifically, normal saline to cleanse the site and duodenn to apply to the\nwound.  (Duodenn will be discussed under vendor non-payment.)\n\nFor about a week sterile water from treatment kits for other uses has been used to cleanse\nwounds.  Sterile water is an appropriate substitute, however, normal saline is preferred.\nNormal saline is an item mat should be routinely on hand in any nursing facility, and is also\nnecessary for the sterile cleansing of other equipment, such as catheter and tracheostomy\ntubing.\nWhile making rounds with the treatment nurse on Thursday evening, December 7,1995, the\nCourt Monitor discovered there was no normal saline in-house. On unit 4A, at Mr. CF.'s\nbedside while dressing Mr. CF.'s stage HI decubitus ulcer on his left hip, the treatment nurse\ntold me mat they have been out of normal saline for about a week.  This reminded me of a\ncamping  expedition,  where  ingenuity  in  substituting  routine  supplies  saves  the  day.\nHowever, mis is a human being with a gaping whole in his body. At times DCV is operating\nlike an underdeveloped country, when in fact this is the nation's capital.\nOn October 10, 1995, DCV submitted a \"request for purchase order\" to the Procurement\nOffice, Department of Human Services, District of Columbia. Among the items listed on the\npurchase order were normal saline and duodena. The request for purchase order was marked\n\"Urgent per Court Order.\" Once purchase orders are sent from the Procurement Office and\nreceived by DCV, they are sent by DCV to the vendor for delivery of supplies. If  the vendor\nhas been paid, supplies will be delivered.\nDCV received the requested purchase order on December 6, 1995. Prior to receipt of the\nP.O., the staff person from DCV submitting the \"request for purchase order\" called Ms.\nCheryl Perkins of the Procurement Office and stressed to her the urgent need for receipt of\nthe P.O. for care of the residents and that priority should be given to DCV which is under\na Court Order.  Apparently, Ms. Perkins' response was that there are many District of\nColumbia agencies under Court Orders.  I believe the analogy the DCV staff person used is\na good one: \"Ms. Perkins needs to know that DCV cannot be run like a stationery store,\nwhere you run out of pens or something: residents lives are at stake.\"\nIn a nursing facility it is not always possible to anticipate needed supplies months in advance.\nFor example, the size of bandages needed will depend on whether a wound develops (which\nshould not be happening), the site, and the anatomy of the resident.\nAccording to staff and administration at DCV, receiving purchase orders in a timely fashion\nfrom the Procurement Office has been a chronic problem.  (Recommendations to the Court\nare at the end of the profiles section.)\nLack of adequate supplies for resident treatment and care is a violation of federal regulations\nand the Court Orders.\n\n(3)  Chronic Non-Compliance of Payment of Vendors\nAs of Saturday, December 9,1995, DCV is out of supply of one treatment modality\nfor decubitus ulcers, duoderm.  Treatment nurses are using a substitute which they believe\nis not quite as effective.  One treatment nurse does have a limited supply of duoderm only\nbecause, through her wisdom and experience, she secreted supplies anticipating this scenario.\nThere is no duoderm, although I am informed emergency supplies are on the way, because\nDistrict  Healthcare,  the  vendor,  has  not  been  paid.  District  Healthcare  is  owed\napproximately $42,000.\nUpdate on National Nurses. Inc.. profiled in December 6,1995, letter to the Court:\nOn Thursday evening, December 7,1995, Mr. Ronald Messenheimer, President of National\nNurses, Inc., left a message for the Court Monitor, that he had received \"confirmation from\nthe Chief Financial Officer's office (for the District of Columbia) mat National will be payed\nin the next check run on Friday or Monday. I will continue services pending receipt of check\non Friday or Monday.\"\nOn Friday afternoon, December 8, 1995, Ms. Barbara Mann of the Corporation Counsel's\noffice  for the District of Columbia,  left a message for the Court Monitor concerning\nNational Nurses Inc., that \"we are not aware of any termination prior to the weekend or\nimmediately thereafter, it is our understanding a check will be delivered to them not later\nthan Thursday of next week.  We are covered for the weekend at DCV.\" This information\nis in conflict with the information Mr. Messenheimer was told the day before from the Chief\nFinancial Officer's  office.\nThe Court Monitor will inform the Court on a regular basis. Within the past week, the Court\nMonitor has begun to notice shortages of staff; primarily of nurse aides.  Contract nurse\nstaffing vendors are supplying nurses. However, none of them have been paid. Most recently\nin a letter dated December 6,1995, to Mr. Vernon Hawkins, Director, Department of Human\nServices for the District of Columbia, CUP HealthCare Services has  indicated they will\nterminate services on Thursday, December 14, 1995.  CUP HealthCare Services is owed\n$93,102.86, ( $11,935.77 of which is from December 1994.)\nNurse aides are District of Columbia government employees, are unionized, and are opting\nto take annual leave before DCV closes and they loose their benefits.  Further monitoring is\nneeded to determine why there are not nurse aide replacements and where there may be a\npotential source. Apparently, through the Personnel Department of the District of Columbia,\nthere is difficulty  securing staff for a limited term employ.\nDCV receives one of the highest Medicaid reimbursement rates in the continental United\nStates, approximately $240 per resident per day.  This amounts to approximately $87,600\n\nper resident per year.  When the Court Monitor first arrived at DCV on August 28, 1995,\nthere were 270 residents. That is a total reimbursement rate of approximately $24,000,000\nper year. Approximately half of mis total is federal funds and approximately half is District\nfunds.  According to DCV administration, as mentioned in the Court Monitor's November\nStatus Report to the Court, DCV is funded through fiscal Year 1996. Where are these funds?\nThe same vendor non-payment problems profiled in the affidavits of June 1995, which led\nto the Stipulated Court Order of July 6, 1995, are the same problems today.  (Remedies\nneeded to rectify this situation are at the end of the profiles section.)\n(4)  Residents Denied Personal Needs Allowance (PNA5)\nResidents are to receive their Personal Needs Allowance (PNA) on the first of each\nmonth. As of today, the residents have not received their December funds, nor can anyone\ntell them when they will receive their money.  The residents have a Holiday shopping trip\nplanned for Friday, December 15, 1995.\nThe Personal Needs Allowance is residents' money and in the District of Columbia amounts\nto $70 per month. The source of the PNA is two-fold.  One is for the \"categorically needy.\"\nThese are residents with no other source of income and who receive Supplemental Security\nIncome (SSIj. This amounts to a federal minimum share of $35 per month and in the District\nof Columbia a matching share to equal the $70 per month.  Q. believe the ratio in the District\nis federal contribution of $40 and the District of Columbia contribution of $30.)  The second\nsource of PNA is the \"medically needy.\"  That is residents with social security, disability,\nand or public or private pensions.  From these sources of income, $70 per month is\nwithdrawn and to be put into the residents PNA. The remainder of these sources of income\ncontribute to the residents Medicaid reimbursement rate.\nIn an interview with the teller at DCV on Friday, December 8, 1995, the teller told me that\nhe has not received money in two and a half months, what he has been using to give to\nresidents as their PNA is money remaining in the fiscal budget (I believe last year's.), and\nthat he normally receives funds every week to two weeks.  The teller also told the Court\nMonitor that the PNA is from the District of Columbia Treasury.\nIt is a violation of federal law and regulations to co-mingle resident funds with anv other\naccount  Resident funds in excess of $50 are required by federal regulations to be in an\n\"interest bearing account (or accounts) mat is separate from any of the facility's operating\naccounts, and that credits all interest earned on resident's funds to that account\" [42 CFR\nPart 483.10 O (1) through (7)].\nJudge Hogan, I cannot tell you how sad and pitiful it is to see the residents hovering around\n5\n\nthe window of the teller, across the hallway from the administration offices.  There is a\nsteady stream of residents throughout the day. The residents have not reached the justifiable\nanger stage yet, although some are close to it  la their eyes you can see that they are stunned,\nbewildered, and hurt  On Thursday, December 7 the staff was paid.  The residents are\nacutely aware of this and the fact, that there is no money to pay them their own funds.\nThe residents have so little in life, it is their dignity that is being robbed from them as well\nas their money. Being deprived of their PNA adds to the stress of the impending loss of their\nhomes, and the stress of institutionalization at the Holiday season.\nRecommendations and Immediate Remedies Needed\nI believe all the above situations will continue unless the recommendations and remedies that\nfollow are immediately put in place. As DCV continues to approach closing, I can foresee\noperations unraveling, as it has already begun to do so in the areas profiled above: nurse\nstaffing, dressings for the treatment of decubitus ulcers, wheelchair repairs, and the residents'\nPersonal Needs Allowance. I foresee the non-payment of vendors becoming out of control.\nI believe the primary issue is the misuse of and lack of accountability for government funds\nearmarked for the operations of D.C. Village Nursing Home and for the direct care of the\nresidents of t).C. Village Nursing Home - the most vulnerable and frail of the District of\nColumbia population.  Non-payment of vendors is symptomatic of this larger issue and is\nmanifested in the culture of tolerance for and acceptance of bureaucratic inertia.  The\nbehaviors surrounding this culture are manifested internally at DCV by the acceptance of and\ntolerance for lack of supplies for basic humane care, and externally among DCV government\nofficials,  by the tolerance and acceptance of needless delays in the procurement process.\nTherefore,  in order to prevent the further  dissolution of residents' rights the following\nimmediate remedies are needed:  (These remedies are not to supplant my recommendations\nin my Status Reports to the Court, the remedies identified here specifically relate to the\nconcerns identified in this letter.)\n(1)  An independent audit under the Court's auspices, of the government funds\nearmarked for DCV.  (For over a month now the Court Monitor has requested the Budget\nand Annual Costs Reports of DCV, most recently in the November Status Report.'):\n(2)  Since there are dedicated federal and District matching funds earmarked solely\nfor the operations and direct care of the residents at DCV, there is no need for requests for\npurchase orders to enter the bureaucratic maze of the D. C. Government process. And since\nDCV has a scheduled closing date of the end of March, 1995, all requests for necessary\npurchase orders will be filled within a two week turn around:\n\n(3)  An accounting of Resident Personal Funds:\n(4) Establishment immediately of a separate account for residents* personal funds\nincluding the residents' Personal Needs Allowance.\nJudge Hogan, I look forward to serving the Court in monitoring the implementation of these\nrecommendations and immediate remedies needed for the best interests of the residents of\nD.C. Village Nursing Home.\nSincerely,\nHarriet A. Fields, EAD., R.N.\nCourt Monitor\ncc:  Mr. Richard J. Farano\nMr. David Deutsch\nCivil Rights Division\nU.S. Department of Justice\nP.O.

C. VILLAGE NURSING HOME\n\nREPORT OF THE EVALUATION OF FOOD AND NUTRITION\nSERVICES OF THE D.C. VILLAGE NURSING HOME\nSubmitted by\nMamie W. Byrd, R.D., L.D.\nJewel L. Lewis, M.Ed, R.D., L.D.\nAllan A. Johnson, Ph.D., L.N.\nDepartment of Nutritional Sciences\nHoward University\nJanuary 17, 1996\n\nREPORT OF THE EVALUATION OF THE FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICES AT\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA VILLAGE NURSING HOME\nThe food and nutrition services components of the D.C. Village\nNursing Home were evaluated at the request of Dr. Harriet Fields,\nRegistered Nurse, the Court Monitor, during the period of\nDecember 20, 1995 through January 5, 1996, by two (2) Howard\nUniversity faculty members: Mrs. Mamie Byrd, Registered/Licensed\nDietitian, Instructor, and Project Director of the Howard\nUniversity Health Promotion Institute, and Mrs. Jewel Lewis,\nM.Ed., Registered/Licensed Dietitian, Assistant Professor,\nDepartment of Nutritional Sciences.\nMrs. Byrd has an extensive background in nutritional care\nmanagement and Long-Term Care services, as well as teaching\nClinical Nutrition at Howard University.  Mrs. Byrd conducted the\nevaluation of clinical nutrition services.\nMrs. Jewel Lewis teaches Food Service Systems Management and\nQuantity Food Production Management at Howard; served as the\nstate agency nutritionist for the D.C. Office on Aging for five\n(5) years; former Food Service Director of the Washington Center\nfor Aging Services, and has practiced dietetics for 26 years.\nTogether this teams' experience exceeds 40 years of clinical\nnutrition care and foodservice administration and management.\nMrs. Lewis performed the evaluation of foodservice\nadministration, management, production, and service.\n\nThis report addresses the findings from the evaluation according\nto the following:\nCourt Order:  To ensure that sufficient supplies of\nnutritious and appropriate food and drink are\nconsistently maintained at DCV and that each\nresident daily receives adequate, well-\nbalanced, nutritious and appropriate food and\ndrink according to their nutritional needs.\nFOOD SERVICE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION\nThree problems were identified in the policies and procedures\narea:\n1.  The policies and procedures manual was incomplete and\noutdated.\n2.  There were no apparent policies to cover the following\ncritical areas of patient care and foodservice\nmanagement:\na.  Decubitus ulcer protocol\nb.  Documentation of food consumption\nci  Hydration schedule\nd.  Addressing unplanned weight loss\ne.  Menu Analysis\nf.  Menu Substitutions\ng.  Staffing pattern\nh.  Job descriptions\ni.  Employee Scheduling\nj.  Employee Orientation\nk.  Purchasing procedures\n1.  Emergency food/beverage supplies\nm.  Re-assessment of post-hospitalized residents\n3.  Lack of uniformity in patient care management\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  Prepare policies and procedures for each of the critical\nareas of patient care and foodservice management, including\nthe above listing.  Procedures should be adequately detailed\nto ensure the desired treatment out outcome for the policy\nwritten.\n2.  Conduct in-service training to acquaint staff with the\npolicies and procedures developed.\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS/BUDGET ISSUES\nDocumentations were not provided for this area.  The Food Service\nDirector had promised to meet with me at 8:30 a.m. on January 4,\n1996 to provide data to support the above, as well as other\nmaterials requested.  However, I was kept waiting in her office\nfor l hour and she never showed up though I was told that she was\nin the building.  I left the building at 9:35.  She had informed\nme earlier that she would not be in the office the following day.\nI was told that she had complained to the Corporation Council\nregarding the request for documents and was later asked by the\nCourt Monitor not to collect any more data.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nAn audit of financial activities at D.C. Village be conducted by\nan independent auditor.\nFOOD SERVICE SYSTEMS\nIn order to ensure compliance with the above court order, the\nfollowing foodservice systems must be in existence and rigorously\nadhered to:\nFirst, .there should be an effective procurement system which\nincludes a purchasing manual that incorporates statements of\nobjectives, scope, authority, and relationships.  A good manual\ncan provide continuity and consistency, which are difficult to\nmaintain otherwise.\nReceiving, storage, and inventory control are some of the\ncritical elements of procurement.\nReceiving\nReceiving can be defined as an activity for ensuring that\nproducts delivered by suppliers are those that were ordered in\nthe purchasing activity.\nThe receiving process involves more than just acceptance of\nand signing for delivered products.  It also includes verifying\nthat quality, size, and quantity meet specifications.\nWhen procedures are not systematized, a number of problems\nmay arise, such as losses due to carelessness, failure to assure\nquality and quantity of goods delivered, and pilferage. Competent\npersonnel with specified responsibilities, well written\nspecifications, procedures for critical control, adequate\nsupervision, scheduled receiving hours and procedures to ensure\nsecurity are desired elements of the receiving activity.\n• i\n\nStorage\nStorage is the holding of goods under proper conditions to ensure\nquality until time of use.\nOnly those personnel authorized to store goods, issue goods,\ncheck inventory levels, or clean the areas should have access to\nstorage facilities since prevention of theft and pilferage is a\nmajor concern. Both have impacts on the availability of adequate\nfood supplies.\nInventory Records\nInventory is a record of food, supplies, and materials owned by\nthe facility. Inventory records have four basic objectives.\n1.  Provision of accurate information on food and supplies in\nstock\n2.  Determination of purchasing needs\n3.  Provision of data for food cost control\n4.  .Prevention of theft and pilferage\nInventory control is the technique of maintaining food, food\nsupplies, and materials at desired quantity levels.  The major\nobjectives of this control are to maintain quality of goods and\nsupplies, to minimize inventory costs, and to ensure that\nadequate quantities of food are on hand for production and\nservice needs.\nA periodic physical count of food and supplies in storage is an\nimportant requisite of any inventory control system.\nD.C. Village failed to provide documentation of:\n1)  Inventory\n2)  Storeroom requisition files\n3)  Existence of a purchasing manual\n4)  Policies and procedures regarding purchasing, including\nreceiving, storage, and inventory control\nir\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  Develop an effective procurement system, including a\npurchasing manual, statements of objectives, scope,\nauthority, and relationships, including a section for each\nof the elements of the procurement system.\n3.  A periodic physical count of food and supplies in storage be\nconducted and records be retained according to the required\nlegal period.\n4.  Appropriate staff receive in-service training in numbers\n1,2, and 3 above.\nThe second critical area in the foodservice system is production\nor the preparation of menu items in the needed quantity and with\nthe desired quality, at a cost appropriate to the foodservice\noperation. While quantity deals with numbers, quality should\ninclude not only the aesthetic aspects of a food product but also\nthe nutritional value and the microbiological safety of the\nproduct.\nThe basic tool for the production system is the production sheet\nwhich translates the menu into a plan of operation and is the\nsingle most- important, available production control.  This form\nshould contain as a minimum the following information:\n•  *census\n•  menu item\n•  *recipe\n•  *portion size\n•  total portions\n•  *amount to prepare\n•  distribution of portions\n•  *overproduction and underproduction\n•  special instruction and comments\n•  preparation\n•  *menu substitutions\n\nSix (6) of the above eleven (11) elements of minimum information\nwere omitted on the production sheet used at D.C. Village\n(identified by asterisks).  This discussion is limited to three\n(3) of those six (6) items since they impact directly on the\ncourt order.\nRecipe\nStandardized recipes must be used in order to verify yield, or\nnumber of servings, compute food costs, and ensure consistent\nquality. Recipe numbers and titles need to be indicated in order\nto avoid any confusion by the production staff, including cooking\nutensil(s) and service equipment.\nPortion Size\nThis is needed for use in calculating quantities to prepare and\nfor communicating to food service personnel the standards on\nwhich production is based.\nQuantity of Food to Prepare\nShould be indicated in pounds, etc. for meat and dry ingredients;\nthe size and number of cans, etc. for canned items ; and the\nnumber (#) of pounds for frozen foods, etc.\nWhile some of the information was available it was not always\nbeing used appropriately.  Production sheets listed the number of\nservings to produce, but the quantities of food required to be\nproduced to achieve these numbers were omitted. Other\nirregularities included:\n1.  Recipes were not being used by foodservice personnel to\ndetermine portion sizes.\n2.  Improper serving utensils were being used for four (4) food\nitems during a luncheon meal:  three (3) ounce serving\nutensils were being used where 4 ounce portions were\nrequired.\n3.  Portion sizes were omitted on menus, production sheets, and\nrecipes.  Therefore the nutritional status of residents is\nat risk.\ni n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  Develop a system for food production and service including\npolicies and procedures for effective production controls.\n2.  Modify, update or adopt a recipe system to include (a)\nportion sizes, (b) specifications of cooking equipment to be\nused to prepare the food item, (c) type(s) of serving\nutensil(s) to ensure the desired portion size is achieved.\n3.  Modify and update production sheets to include portion sizes\nand quantities to be prepared.\n4.  Include portion sizes on all menus, including nourishment\nsheets.\n5.  Conduct in-service training for appropriate management and\nstaff to familiarize them with items 1, 2, 3, and 4 above.\n6.  Adopt a comprehensive and systematic program for trayline\nquality assurance and monitoring, including the designation\nof appropriate staff to check each station on the trayline\nfor proper serving utensils prior to the beginning of each\nmeal.\n7.  Documentation of menu substitutions on the menu as served\nand on the production sheets.  Residents should be notified\nof necessary changes through an approved and effective\nmechanism.\n8.  Purchase an appropriate nutrient analysis computer software\npackage to analyze all menus.\nThe entire menu system should be reviewed.  The diet manual\nindicates that the facility provides eight (8) different\nroutine diets, excluding test diets, but records indicate\nthat 20 different types of diets have been prescribed for\nthe residents, varying in complexity and compositions and\nsimilar to those found in a an acute care hospital diet\nmanual.\nMany of the diet prescriptions are very restrictive.\nGenerally this type of situation lends itself to\nnoncompliance with the diet order on the part of the\nresident such that food intake is diminished, plate waste is\nprevalent, and residents become extremely dissatisfied with\nthe meal service.  Geriatricians, especially geriatric\ndietitians and nutritionists, advocate and recommend a more\nliberal dietary pattern for nursing home residents.\n\nGreater satisfaction and improved food intake have been\ndemonstrated through the use of a more liberal diet.  The\nuse of nutritional supplements are usually decreased as a\nconsequence and often results in tremendous costs savings to\nthe facility.\nResidents at D.C. Village were very vocal about expressing\ntheir dissatisfaction with the food served at the facility,\nincluding complaints about \"receiving the wrong food\nitem(s); \"unattractive meals\"; \"tasteless food\";  \"small\nservings\", \" the same foods served for Christmas as any\nother day\".\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  Adopt a more liberal dietary pattern consistent with the\ndietary practices of most nursing homes to improve the\ndietary intake of residents.\n2.  Advise physicians of the need to use the facility's diet\nmanual as a guideline for ordering diets for their patients\nin order to achieve the goals of the facility.\nCLINICAL NUTRITION CARE MANAGEMENT\nThe Court Monitor, Dr. Harriet Fields, Registered Nurse,\nrequested that this portion of the evaluation be focused on the\nnutritional care management for three (3) categories of\nresidents: (1)  those with decubitus ulcers(pressure sores), (2)\nthose who had experienced significant unplanned weight changes,\nand (3) and those who had experienced frequent hospitalizations.\nA sample of twelve (12) residents was randomly selected from a\nlist of twenty-four (24) residents provided to the evaluator by\nthe Court Monitor.\nThe twelve (12) charts were reviewed to assess the quality  of\nresidents' care and to determine the degree of compliance with\nfederal and local regulations. Findings were as follows:\n1.  One hundred percent (100%) of the records lacked\ndocumentation of food consumption, that is, no record was\navailable which documented the amount or percentage of\nfood, beverages and dietary supplements consumed by the\nresident. The use of food consumption records is a standard\nnutrition care management practice.  With only an occasional\nnotation, it is virtually impossible to assess the\nnutritional adequacy of a resident's  food and fluid intake.\n\n2.  Sixty-seven percent (67%) of the records contained\nprescribed dietary supplements. Frequency of use and volume\nprescribed is of concern due to the fact that excessive use\nof dietary supplements has been demonstrated to suppress\nappetite and decrease the amount of food ingested during the\nservice of regular meals.\n3.  Forty-two percent (42%)of the records indicated that\nresidents were to receive increased fluids based on assessed\nneeds by the Registered Dietitian.  However no distinct\nidentifiable interventions were observed on the charts or\nresident's meal trays in comparison with those residents who\ndid not have recommended or prescribed interventions.\n4.  Twenty-five percent (25%) had experienced significant,\nunplanned weight loss or gains which were not aggressively\nand sufficiently addressed by dietary interventions. In\nthree (3) cases no follow-up strategies were suggested or\nimplemented,  eg., re-weighing of residents to verify\nchanges in weight and to rule out scale errors; calorie\ncounts; meal observations; visitation of residents during\nmeal hours to validate food consumption; review and update\nfood preferences or perhaps consultations with the attending\nphysicians, nursing aides or family members, etc..\nCase Study:\nA. Mr. B.T., a resident of unit 2B, is a quadriplegic with\nmultiple decubiti who has recently experienced significant\nweight changes as well as a relatively recent hospitalization.\nThe resident's weight history is as follows :(8/95) 149 lbs.,\n(9/95)164.5 lbs., (10/95) 132 lbs. During the months of (11/95)\nand (12/95) resident refused to be weighed.  The dietitian\ndocumented her awareness of his weight problem in her progress\nnote of 10/24/95.  However there was no documented effort to\nexplain the loss; changes in appetite; adequacy of intake;\nacceptance and tolerance of diet; and no plan of care or\nintervention strategies were proposed.  A later consultation with\nthe Nursing Coordinator for this unit revealed that Mr. B.T. had\nexperienced a hospitalization for urinary retention which was\nprobably the reason for his unusual pattern of weight changes.\nHowever, the 10/95 weight still represented a significant weight\nloss from this  resident's usual weight. Further, the nursing\nrecords revealed his refusal of the prescribed supplements, yet\nthis was not addressed in the dietitian's progress notes or the\ncare plan.  The supplements were not discontinued and no other\ndietary interventions were proposed.\n\nOther nutrition related problems noted regarding this resident\ninclude a moderately depressed serum albumin level of 3.3 mg/dl\nper 6/95 lab results and no follow up was done or  recommended.\nIn view of the problem with severe weight loss, decubiti and poor\noral intake this indicator can serve as a predictor of\nmalnutrition. An albumin level of less than 3.5 mg/dl frequently\nreflects protein-calorie malnutrition.\nNursing was also the verbal source of other very pertinent\ninformation such as  the  resident's non-compliant behaviors\nrefusal to be turned, refusal to do ADL's and refusal to eat\nanything if he did not get what he had specifically requested\nfrom the dietary department.  While this resident has a long\nhistory of being a very \"picky eater\", none of these facts was\nnoted in the dietary or nursing progress notes nor in the\nresident's interdisciplinary care plans.\nFinally, an interview, with a Registered Nurse who stated that\nshe has had a twelve (12) year history of  caring for this\nresident, revealed that he had recently exhibited signs of\n\"giving up\" and depression.  She explained that she believed this\nmay have something to with the recent changes in his behaviors,\nas well as his mental and emotional outlook on life.  Yet none of\nthese observations or suspicions  had been documented.  The\nwriter inquired about a psychiatric consult or if there was\nanyone who was\nemotionally close to resident who could possibly coax or\nencourage him.  The response was that she had hoped that he was\nscheduled to be seen by an outside group of consultant\npsychiatrists who were currently making rounds.  The chart review\nwas performed on 1/5/96 and none of this was reflected in the\nresident's chart at that time.  The Head RN stated her intention\nto adjust the  IDT  patient care plans to reflect more detailed\nand relevant aspects and issues surrounding the management of his\ncare.\n5.  Seventeen percent (17%) of resident's care plans did not\nreflect the current resident status and care or simply did\nnot adequately address the care needed.\n6.  Thirty-three percent (33%) of annual nutrition assessments\nomitted significant data regarding the resident's  progress\nas it related to residents' nutritional status and the\nnutritional care plan goals.  Current issues of resident\ncare were also omitted.\n10\n\nMeal Observation and Tray Accuracy\nDuring this review several meal rounds and tray line observations\nwere conducted, including meal trays of those residents who were\nincluded in the patient sample of for charts reviewed.  However\nobservations were not limited to those alone.\nDuring and throughout the visitation a pattern of tray\ninaccuracies became evident.\n1.  On 12/28/95 Mr. CF of Unit 3A who has a diet prescription\nfor a High Fiber diet received white bread which was even\nmarked on his tray card. Apple juice was on his tray, also.\nReviewing the dietary department's carded file revealed that\nhe should have received wheat bread and cranberry juice,\naccording to physician's order.\n2.  On 1/3/95 JB's chart on Unit 3A indicated that he was to\nreceive a 2 gram Sodium Pureed diet, but he was served a\ndental soft diet.  Fortunately, this resident was able to\ntolerate the diet very well. However, the question arises\nregarding the need for re-evaluation by the dietitian to\nrecommend an upgraded diet for this resident. A pureed diet\nprobably  would not have been acceptable to this resident.\n.However, the diet sent to the resident did not correlate\nwith the diet order or tray ticket.\nOther examples of tray inaccuracies were noted, and are available\nupon request.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  The development and implementation of a comprehensive system\nfor nutritional care management of the residents at D.C.\nVillage nursing home.\n2.  The development and implementation of a uniform system for\ndocumenting the nutritional care management of residents at\nD.C. Village nursing home.\n3.  Establish policies, procedures, goals, and objectives for\ntraining management and staff in tray accuracy and tray line\nmonitoring, including outside conferences, courses,\nseminars, work shops, and/or professional consultants.\n4.  Routine updating and documentation of residents1 food\npreferences, dislikes, and allergies.\n11\n\n5.  Establishment and implementation of an effective and\nconsistent program of hydration, including a Hydration\nPolicy to ensure uniform approaches in the prevention\nand treatment of dehydration. Both Nursing and Dietary\nDepartments will need to collaborate to devise a policy and\nprocedures.\n6.  Institute a mechanism or method for assessing and\ndocumenting food intake.\n7.  Comply with residents' rights by developing a policy to post\nmenus on each unit and follow through with the same.\n8.  Comply with the facility's policy for the re-admission\nof residents after hospitalization.\n9.  Implementation of a more uniform and aggressive approach to\naddressing significant unplanned weight changes.\n10.  Adoption of a uniform and systematic  interdisciplinary care\nprogram to reflect a more integrated approach to patient\ncare and describe the plans in writing.\n11.  Evaluate use of commercial nutritional supplements.\n12.  Establish a program of quality assurance monitoring which\nincludes the following areas:\na)  tray accuracy\nb)  analysis of all menus for nutrient content\nc)  timeliness, accuracy, uniformity and quality of\nnutritional care documentation.\nd)  interdisciplinary care plans, treatment protocols, and\nclient surveys and/or questionnaires.\n12\n-mrr\n\nAPPENDIX C\nPAYMENT OF VENDORS\n\nDCVIL >GE NURSING HO VIEVENDC RREPORT\nPerson What OutetarDales & Service* Payment Continue to Ship/\nVendor Name Contacted Suppled?

I am saddened and pained that the defendants chose to\ndevote their energies (behind closed doors with the considerable personnel resources from the\nDistrict) into falsely refuting the messenger's January 17 Status Report, as opposed to taking the\nmessage to the bedside as a vehicle to improve care for the residents.\nIt is a tribute to the courage of the Court in its relentless concern for the health and welfare and\nrights of the residents through the issuance of the Court Orders and the findings of contempt, that\nthe reactive steps defendants have taken to improve care for the residents at DCV have come\nabout.\nThe intent of this letter to the Court is not to elaborate all the inaccuracies, and misrepresentations\nof the defendants January Responses and submissions to the Court, but rather U> focus on two\n\nFEB-01-96  THU 17:47  NCCNHR  FAX NO.  2023322949  P.03\nwhich have profound and immediate impact on the health and welfare of the residents.  These\nareas relate to my continued concern with the outplacement process, which I have elaborated on\nin my previous submissions to the Court.  These concerns acutely and specifically relate to the\noutplacement of the residents with mental retardation and the outplacement of the residents with\nmental illness.\nOutplacement of Residents with Mental  Rft?rd3tion\nYesterday, Wednesday, January 31,1996,1 had a telephone conversation with Ms. Sheila\nGaither, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of D.C. Family Services.  Ms. Gaither did in fact have\na meeting  on January 24 at DCV and did review the records of nine residents with mental\nretardation.  However, the remaining statements by the defendants on the page before numbered\npage 5 of the Defendants January., submission to the Court are false.  According to Ms. Gaither\nthe truth is the following:\n(1) D.C. Family Services has the capacity to accept seven residents, not nine - six residents\nat their O Street, SE site, and one resident at their 58Street, NE site.  However, there has been\nno agreement with DCV as to exactly who these residents would be.\n(2) The O St. site is currently under \"reconstruction\" to fit D.C. regulatory codes and\nand the particular physical care needs of the six residents.  It is expected that this work will be\ncompleted in about two weeks.\n(3) There are no direct care staff in place as yet, an ad was placed in last Sunday's paper.  /\n(4) There was no mention of a January 29 date for commencing of training mentioned at\nthe January 24 meeting.  No date has been scheduled tor training.  No training has taken place.\nMs.  Gaither indicated that direct care staff including certified nurse aides, as well as nurses and\nlicenced practical nurses, will need training on the particular and individual care needs of this\npopulation of residents.  Ms. Gaither recognizes, as well as have other group home providers said\nto me, that the remaining residents with mental retardation at DCV are among the most medically\nfragile of all residents with mental retardation in the District of Columbia.\nMs.  Gaither would like to see training of D.C. Family Services nurses and licensed practical\nnurses at DCV by the Georgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC) staff and then\nto have the GUCDC staff on site at D.C. Family Services facilities to work with and observe the\nlicensed staff and train the direct care giver certified nurse aide staff. Ms. Gaither believes this\ntraining must take place in order for DC Family Services to responsibly and adequately care for\nseven of the residents with mental retardation from DCV.  Because of the fragile condition of the\nresidents, Ms. Gaither has plans tor a 4 staff to 6 residents ratio for care giving in addition to a\nlicensed practical nurse.\n\nFEB-01-96  THU 17:48  NCCNHR  FAX NO.  2023322949  P.04\n(5) D.C. Family Services has not been paid since July, and that is they have not been paid\nfor three residents with mental retardation from DCV discharged to DC Family Services on June\n30,  1995.\n(6) D.C. Family Services has no agreement with the District of Columbia on an interim\nper diem rate for the O Street facility.\nBecause of all the above factors, especially items (4),  (5), and (6) above, D.C. Family Services\nwill not accept residents from DCV until the items above are resolved.\nI also snared with Ms. Gaither what I have previously profiled in my November 30,1995. Status\nReport to the Court and what I had  heard again last Saturday, January 27, 1996, at DCV from\na therapeutic recreation staff person who observed it.  That is that three residents discharged at\nthe end of June to D.C. Family Services  Division Street site were found outside during the day,\none to be dirty and  disheveled, another in pajamas, and the third whose diaper was changed in\npublic.  Ms. Gaither said she did not know about this, there is no excuse for this,  and said she\nwould  look  into  it.  Ms.  Gaither  also assured  that  there  is a new house manager  hired  in\nSeptember for this site, for whom she has high praise for her competency, and that there has been\nincreased inscrvice and follow-up inservice at this site.\nToday,  Thursday,  February  1,  1996,  I  faxed  to  Ms.  Gaither  the  above  section  under\n'Outplacement of Residents with Mental Retardation.'  Ms. Gaither affirmed to me ihat it is an\naccurate representation of our telephone conversation of yesterday.\nAn additional concern regarding the outplacement of residents with mental retardation is the\nfollowing.  On Monday,  January  29,  1996, a memo was  issued  by DCV  listing  residents\nscheduled for outplacement this week.  On the list are the three medically fragile residents with\nmental  retardation listed in the December 22,  1995, remedial order of the Court.  Yet,  the\nidentified receiving skilled nursing facility staff have received no orientation and training in the\nindividualized  care  needs  of  these  residents.  There  is  no  contract  in place  for  specialty\nconsultation team to supply these services.  This is a violation of the Court Orders.\nOutplacement of Residents with Mental Illness\nI continue to remain very concerned about the outplacement of residents  with mental\nillness.  A significant  number  of residents with mental illness at DCV were  inappropriately\noutplaced to DCV from St. Elizabeth's Hospital several years ago.  My concerns are that the\nresidents with mental illness will be once again inappropriately outplaced from DCV to a site\nwhich is not appropriate for their individualized needs pursuant to the Court Orders.  The Dixon\nCommittee is also focused on the most appropriate settings for individuals with mental illness.\nA letter to the Court Monitor expressing their concerns is submitted with this letter to the Court.\nTo date there is no indication of assessments completed on residents, although, I am told the\n3\n\nFEB-01-96  THU  17:48  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 05\n\"assessments are in transcript.\"  On Saturday, January 27, 1996, the Court Monitor along with\na consultant to the Court Monitor, who is also conducting surveys on a consultant basis for the\nHealth Care Financing Administration, reviewed several charts.  We asked the nurse on Unit 3B,\nwhere most of the residents with mental illness who were discharged from St. Elizabeth's Hospital\nlive, if there are assessments in the chart.  The nurse assured us there are, yet we could find none.\nWe asked the nurse to show us where they are, she could find only an order for assessments.\nThere is also no counseling for residents nor adequate psychiatric services as identified in the\nCourt Order of December 22, 1995.\nAt this time it is not possible to determine whether there will be a specialty consult team in place\nnor are sites identified  to ensure a safe and effective transition to their (the residents) new\nresidences, to train the new residence staff in how best to care for the individual, and to help\nmeet  the  individuals'  ongoing  individualized  needs...until  the receiving  facility  staff  is\nstabilized  and their competency  demonstrated  as specified  in the Court  Orders.  This is\nparticularly problematic, since the defendants are continuing on the path of a March 31, 1996,\noutplacement date for all residents at DCV.\nAdditional Overall Concerns with Outplacement\nThe outplacement process continues to violate residents' rights and federal regulations and the\nCourt Orders.  The interdisciplinary discharge plans are not adequate.  At present they do not\nreflect input from the interdisciplinary team as identified in the Court Order of December 22,\n1996.  Of 23 resident charts reviewed by the ombuds person,  no record had a psychosocial\nsummary from social service, no record had data from therapeutic recreation, no record had data\nfrom  physical therapy nor occupational therapy, and three records had data from the dietary\ndepartment.\nFor the residents who will not need nursing home care, there has been no discharge planning for\nihe support services they will need to live in the community, such as, homemaker services and\npersonal care aides, which would include meal preparation.\nIn summary,  Judge Hogan,  I respectfully  request that the Court suspend  the  outplacement\nprocess until the above situations are rectified.  If the defendant chooses to comply with the Court\nOrders and not remain in contempt, the suspension of the outplacement process should be very\nshort-lived.  I believe all that is necessary are the following:\n(1) The contract for the specialty consult team for residents with mental retardation be\nfinalized.\n(2) The search for  and the contract with the specialty consult team for  residents with\nmental illness be identified and finalized with input from the Court Monitor as specified in the\nCourt Orders.\n\nFEB-01-96  THU  17:49  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 06\n(3) The appropriate rates for services be agreed upon and finalized.\n(4)  The  interdisciplinary  team  from  DCV  meet  and  develop  for  each  resident  the\nindividualized discharge summary and plan.\nI continue to remain committed to worlcing with the District of Columbia and all concerned parties\nfor the best interests of the residents of DCV and to protect the residents rights, health, and\nwelfare.\nOnce again, Judge Hogan, it is a privilege to serve the Court.\nSincerely,\nHarriet A.

Hogan\nU.S. District Court for the District o 'Columbia\n333 Constitution Ave, NW, 4th Floo r\nWashington, DC 20001\nRe:  The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et aL, Civ. No. 95-948, TFH,\nDC.  Village Nursing Home (DCV), Court Order, July 6,1995;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6,1995;\nCourt Order, December 22, 1996;\nCoirt Order, February 23, 1996\nDear Judge Hogan:\nAs of this writing there are five residents remaining at DCV.  All have identified outplacement\nsites.\nMr. M.W. is due to be outplAced into independent living in his own apartment in the\nDistrict,  as soon as his new home is equipped by DCV with necessary supplies and furniture and\nproper paper work is completed, foil example, identification cards, housing pass, income\nverification, food stamps, metro pass\nMr. J.B. and Mr. HJB. are scheduled Monday to be outplaced to Pleasant Living\nConvalescent Center in Edgewater, Maryland.\nMr. E Jt  is scheduled to be Autplaced to J.B. Johnson Nursing Center.\nMr. C.F. has an independent living site identified for him in the District, but at this writing\nno vacant room and no scheduled date to move.  The systems identified above for Mr. M.W. also\napply to Mr. C.F. and, in addition, Mr. C.F. will need a personal care aide daily.\nSince the presentation by Dr. Sloane and the Court Monitor to the nursing home provider\ncommunity in the District of Coli fia on Tuesday, May 21. Mr. Bryant Hall, administrator of\nCapitol Hill Nursing Center, has litted 14 more residents from DCV.  These beds were made\navailable by converting space throuj an exemption from the certificate of need expressly for\nDCV residents.  This is a tribute to *. Hall for since this meeting he has nearly singularly among\nbis peers, demonstrated a coi commitment and concern for the District of Columbia's\n\"wnr\n\nJUN-16-96 SUN 15:56 NCCNHR\nFAX NO.  2023322949 P. 03\nmost vulnerable and poor, the last nmaining residents of DCV who had no home in which to go.\nIn addition, Ms. Alberta Brasfield, nner administrator at DCV and now the new administrator at\nSSttooddddaarrdd  BBaappttiisstt  NNuurrssiinngg  HHoommee,,  aadinitted another DCV resident who had no other home\nidentified.  (Incidently, this resident,Ms. S.B., outplaced yesterday reports today that \"everyone is\nnice...the food is much better.\") Though these actions most all DCV residents will remain in the\nDistrict or just across the line inCar 'oil Manor Nursing Home in Hyattsville, Maryland.  Only a\nhandful of DCV residents have been outplaced beyond a fifty mile radius of the District and some\nat family members request.  Therefo 'e, nearly all DCV residents will be within the jurisdiction of\nthe long term care orabuds program in the District.\nResidents with Mental Retardation\nAs of June 13 all the residents with jnental retardation have beenoutplaced.  Judge Hogan, your\nCourt Orders especially the Court rder of February 23 has been vital in ensuring that the most\nappropriate and current informatk to their new homes in order\nthat the receiving facility staff areki lowiedgeable of the residents individual care needs.  This is\ntrue for the outplacement of all the esidents but especially so for the outplacement of the\nresidents with mental retardation, every instance the outplacement of this population required\nconstant and vigilant oversight untilliterally the residents were out the door and in the\ntransportation vehicle to take them o their new homes.\nMr. P.L.  On June 13, . PX. was outplaced to Catonsville Community\nConvalescent Center in Catonsville,Maryland.  All necessary and appropriate plans and action\nsteps were and are in place.  TheS ecialty Consultation Team, Georgetown University Child\nDevelopment Center (GUCDC),vintedthe she on June 3 to assess the appropriateness of the site\nand the ability of staff to care for M. PX.'s particular needs.  GUCDC reports the following:\nactivities which would be equivalen to day programming for Mr. P.L. take place daily at the\nfacility; there are a few other reside ts with \"pervasive developmental disabilities'* similar to Mr.\nP.L.; a \"sensory stimulation kit\" hasbeen acquired for the residents with mental retardation; there\nare occupational therapy, physicalt lerapy and speech language services provided and daily\nphysician visits; several residents have \"feeding tubes\" and the \"facility is capable of handling Mr.\nL.*s needs.\"; the facility canaccomi aodate Mr.. P.L.'s wheelchair; the \"administration were\npleased that the GUCDC team will available for consultation and training.\"\nMr. PL. was outplaced ace mpanied by a registered nurse from DCV who has known\nMr. P.L. for years.  Two certifiednirse aides (CNA's) from DCV who have known Mr. PX. for\nyears were with him for the day ancevening shifts this past Thursday and Friday and one will be\nwith him on the day shift through tt weekend.  In addition, a registered nurse (R.N.) from DCV\nwho has known Mr. PX. for quite me time was at Catonsville Convalescent Center when Mr.\nPX. arrived and stayed with him fo the day shift on Thursday and again on Friday.  The R.N.\nreports there is a R.N. at Catonsvill e who will becaring for Mr. PX. who knew him when he was\na resident at Forest Haven years ag before he was admitted to DCV.  According to the DCV\n\nJUN-16-96 SUN 15:57 NCCNHR\nFAX  NO.  2023322949 P. 04\nR.N.,  Mr. P.L. demonstrated recog lition of this former Forest Haven now Catonsville staff\nperson through his open, enthusiastj;:, and endearing  smile upon seeing her.  Next week GUCDC\nstaff including the psychologist,occipational therapist, recreation therapist, speech language\npathologist, and nutritionist are tocommence training and consultation to the Catonsville\nCommunity Convalescent Center st^ff in theunique and individual care needs of this special\nresident.\nJudge Hogan, I want you to knowUatthe most valuable gift the residents with mental retardation\ncan have is your Court Order for th< Specialty Consultation Team to train, educate, and serve as\nconsultants to the staff in the: residei itsnew homes.  I believe this has already markedly improved\nthe lives of the residents with menta retardation.  It is certainly a model to be emulated from this\ntime forward in the District and iin themental retardation community nationally.  Just this past\nWednesday, the coordinator of the KJCDC program marvelled at the improvement in the lives of\nthe residents recently outplaced to t 0  Street, S.E. site of D.C. Family Services.  Through\nGUCDC's presence asconsultants ind educational resources and their ability to work with the\nstaff and the residents in their newIome, GUCDC has seen residents up every day, dressed, with\nshoes on, sitting in chairs, atthe dining table for meals, and out of doors.  The program\ncoordinator reports in all his years DCV, he saw one resident, Mr. R.W., up out of bed \"maybe\nthree times.\" Now Mr. R.W. is up ind dressed everyday.\nThe program coordinator also gavean example of the detrimental impact on the quality of life the\nlack of a specialty consultation tean, such as provided for in the December 22 Court Order in this\ncase, can have.  While recently at P I day program to provide specialty consultation services for\nMr. K.F., a DCV resident outplace< to Wholistic Habilitative Services on April 18 and who\ncommenced the day program on Juiie 5, the program coordinator saw an individual he knew from\nForest Haven where GUCDC had apresence several years ago.\nWhile at Forest Haven, GUCDCWiiS able to work with the staff and this individual (whom\nGUCDC had not seen in years) wb had a habit of hitting himself in the head and causing injury to\nhimself, so much sothat the star! oi itfitted him with a metal helmet to protect himself.  While at\nForest Haven GUCDC was able to work with this individual and the staff to the point that he\n'graduated' to wearing a baseballciipp and then to the point that he no longer exhibited this self-\ndestructive behavior, The project c oordinator was touched and saddened to see last week this\nformer Forest Haven resident exhibting the same self-destructive behavior that GUCDC was able\nto eliminate years ago.  The projectcoordinator opined that if a specialty consultation team had\nbeen in place for this resident whenhe went to his group home from Forest Haven (as well as\nmany others in their experience) asIt is in this case (Civ. No. 95-948) this individual would\ncertainly today have a higher qualit of life than he is obviously having now, and that his resorting\nto previous self-destructive behavicrs is a direct result of the lack of knowledge by present\ncaregivers of previous care iinterventions that at the time improved the individual's life.  Your\nCourt Order, Judge Hogan, provid continuity of care and, in turn, quality of life and protection\nof residents' rights.\n\nJUN-16-96  SUN  15:58 NCCNHR FAX NO. 2023322949 P. 05\nPayment of Vendors ge Hogan, I am relating all of this to you now because a\nsituation has just come to myattend >nthis past Thursday which shocked and distressed me and\ndirectly relates to thespecialty consi Itation teamin this case and the payment of vendors.  In\nApril, I originallyrequested from GIICDC information o<n payment for their services for the\nresidents with mental retardation at X)V.  At that time I had heard that the University had not\nbeen paid although GUCDC staffal DCV were receiving their pay checks.  Georgetown was only\nable to get back to me June 13 wbii<ci are the three pages in attachment one in this letter to the\nCourt.  According to GUCDC the sfendants owe them $668,685.94.  I confirmed with the\naccounts analyst at GUCDC that tbi sum all relates to services provided to residents of DCV.\nUpon receiving this information on \"hursday, I immediately shared it with Ms. Sue Brown who\ncalled Ms. Frances Bowie, Administ •»itor of the Mental Retardation and Developmental\nDisabilities Administration (MRDDJi) in the Department of Human Services.  I faxed the attached\nvendor listing to Ms. Bowie and to is.  Jeanette Michael, the consent decree coordinator at the\nDepartment of Human Services.  In addition, I also spoke with Ms. Michael on Friday, June 14\nabout this matter.  Ms. Michael toldme that the Department of Human Services \"knew that\nGUCDC is owed money but h comes under another Court Order, Joy v. Evans, through\nable position to take, for the fact of the matter is that at times\nMRDDA.\"  To me this is an inexpli\nmenial retardation at DCV were not Evans class members and the\nabout half of the residents with\nGUCDC contract was extendedand amended;at DCV specifically designating GUCDC as the\nspecialty consultation team pursuani to the Court Order of December 22,1995, for all residents\nwith mental retardation at DCV.\nThe accounts analyst has told methjit GUCDC does not intend to terminate services because they\nare committed to their staff and totieiresidents, but that this chronic failure to pay is presenting a\nhardship to them.  At this point:  iin tineGUCDC is the only vendor in this case that still has an on-\ngoing, vital, and direct impact on th protection of the residents rights. At the very least this\nvendor should be paid immediately or the services rendered since the time of the Court Order for\nthe Specialty Consultation Team. Ii is distressing to me that the defendants have not honored the\nvital contribution this vendor proviices ito improve the quality of life of the District's most\nvulnerable by not reimbursing forse rvices:rendered.  It is also of concern to me that although\nthere is acknowledgement by the Department of HLiuman Services that this vendor is due payment,\nthe defendants position is that thisvjendor payment hem pertains to another Court Order, even\nthough MRDDA is part of the Dep, rtment of Human Services and is listed in the United States\nComplaint filed on May 19, 1995,pertaining to this case, and the attached listing of outstanding\ninvoices all relate to services providid to residents of DCV.\nIn my fax to Ms. Bowie, I asked he to get back to me as soon as possible, that we are in Court\non Monday, and I need to knowfro n her. As of this writing I have not heard from Ms. Bowie,\nAs administrator of MRDDA, Ms. lowie is listed as a defendant in this case in the Complaint\nfiled with the Court on May 19, 19S I have other concerns about MRDDA that relate to DCV\nresidents with mental retardation w o are now in their new homes.  This concern was profiled in\nmy June 6 letter to Ms. Sue Brown |and for which the Court, the Plaintiffthe Plaintiff-Intervenor,\nand the Defendants were copied an is attachment two to this letter to the Court.\n\nJUN-16-96 SUN 15:58 NCCNHR FAX NO.  2023322949 P. 06\nDav Programs  There aii two residents, Ms. S.A. and Ms. Si5, for whom off-site day\nprograms are indicated in their indi dual habilitation plans and who have tubes. Ms. S.A. has a\ntracheostomy and Ms. S.P. has agastric tube.  There is apparently a pervasive policy in\ncommunity based day programs in District not to accept residents with tubes, for example,\ntracheostomy and gastric tubes, MI BDA's failure to provide day programs for residents whose\nindividual habilitation plan calls for iff-site community based day programs and allowing the\npolicy by programs receiving medi id funding to discriminate against individuals with tubes,\nviolates the Court Order of July 6, 995,  and the residents rights under federal disabilities law.\nThere are many states throughouttt e country where all day programs accept residents with all\nsorts of tubes.

Village Nursing Home.  Plaintiffs\nasserted a long list of violations of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIP A), 42\nU.S.C. §1997.  On July 6. 1995. the parties signed and the Court approved a consent motion that\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nobligated defendants to remedy these serious, sometimes inhuman, violations and to prevent\nfurther violations and retaliation against the residents of DC. Village.  On August 1, 1995, the\nCourt appointed a Monitor, Dr. Harriet Fields, to oversee the District's compliance with the\nremedial consent order.  Besides entering remedial orders, the Court also ordered the creation of\nspecialty consult teams to aid the Monitor in her task of ensuring that every resident received an\nappropriate and adequate services or outplacement.\nAlthough the District had obligated itself to pursue and implement radical changes in the\nfacility, its compliance with the consent order was poor at best.  Faced with the District's\nnoncompliance, the Court held defendants in contempt of its remedial order on December 22,\n1995, and on February 23, 1996 '\nIn late August 1995, rather than comply with its own agreement, the District abruptly\ndecided to close the facility and failed to produce a plan for the successful placement of the D.C.\nVillage residents into other facilities.  Instead, it embarked upon a system of transfer and\nplacement which was both unsupervised and inappropriate for the task of moving residents, many\nof whom suffered from serious physical ailments.  The District's placement was a disaster— some\nresidents did not even survive the process— and in February 1996, the Court had to suspend the\noutplacement and ask the Monitor to supervise the placement of residents into new facilities and\nensure the District's compliance with the Court's Order.  In June 1996, the last resident was\noutplaced.  The testimonials of former DC.

The Monitor has filed\nher Final Report,2 and has concluded that all former residents of DC. Village have been placed\ninto facilities which are appropriate and adequate.  The Final Report further assures the Court that\nthose former residents are no longer subjected to illegal conditions or practices such as they\nexperienced at DC. Village.  Therefore, the Court is satisfied that its remedial orders have been\ncarried out and that the CRIPA violations have been remedied.\nFurthermore, the parties have undertaken an audit of the patient accounts of the former\nD.C.

Village Nursing Home;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6,1995;\nOrder, December 22,1995\nSubmitted by:\nHarriet A. Fields, Ed.D., R.N.\nCourt Monitor\nDate:\nJanuary 17, 1996\nINTRODUCTION\nThis is the third monthly Status Report submitted by the Court Monitor to the Court.  The\nfirst Status Report was submitted to the Court in October 1995, prior to the October 20\nStatus Hearing.  The second Status Report was submitted November 30, 1995, prior to\nthe December 4, 1995, Status Hearing.\nPursuant to the Stipulated Order of July 6, 1995, the Court Monitor was appointed\nAugust 1, 1995, the initial estimated budget was approved September 6, 1995, and\nmonitoring activities commenced August 28, 1995. A Preliminary Status Report was\nsubmitted on September 5, 1995. On November 7, 1995, the Order Modifying Stipulated\nOrder of July 6 was filed expanding the Court Monitors's duties to oversee the\noutplacement process of the residents of DCV.  (The District of Columbia announced\nclosing of DCV in early August, after the July 6 Stipulated Order was filed and after the\nappointment of the Court Monitor.)\nOn December 20, 1995, the Court found the District in contempt of the July 6 Stipulated\n\nOrder and the amended November Order.  On December 22, 1995, the Court issued a\nremedial Order.\nThis January Status Report will concentrate on this remedial Order of December 22,\n1995, and the Court Monitor's assessments of the ability of the District of Columbia to\ncomply with this Order.\nThis Status Report is divided into five main areas: (1) brief review of the monitor's\nDecember 6 and December 10 letters to the Court subsequent to the November Status\nReport; (2) the monitor's conclusion as to what is immediately needed for the best\ninterests and protection of the residents, to safeguard their welfare, and to prevent further\nviolation of their rights; (3) assessment data supporting the need for new management; (4)\naction steps that must be implemented now by DCV in the interim; (5) potential models\nfor new management;.\nI.  DECEMBER 6 AND DECEMBER 10,1995, LETTERS TO THE COURT\nAfter the November 30 Status Report and the December 4 Status Hearing it became\nnecessary on two occasions to write the Court prior to the next scheduled Status Hearing\nof December 20, 1995.\nThe December 6, 1995, letter to the Court profiled the negative impact on the life of one\nresident in particular, who is wheelchair dependent, and the potential negative impact on\nthe life of the residents in general, through termination of nursing services, due to lack of\npayment of vendors.\nThe December 10, 1995, letter to the Court profiled (1) non-maintenance of resident\nequipment-wheelchair; (2) unconscionable delays in the process of procuring purchase\n\norders for vendor services, so much so that essential supplies for resident care and\ntreatment are lacking; (3) chronic non-compliance of payment of vendors so much so that\nessential services for resident care and treatment were lacking; (4) residents were denied\ntheir Personal Needs Allowance which was in the District of Columbia Treasury.\nRecommendations in the December 10 letter called for an (1) immediate audit of\ngovernment funds earmarked for DCV; (2) requests for purchase orders be filled within\ntwo weeks; (3) an accounting of residents' personal funds; (4) establishment immediately\nof a separate account for residents' personal funds, including the residents' Personal\nNeeds Allowance.\nThe December 6 and December 10, 1995, letters to the Court appear in Appendix A of\nthis January Status Report.\nH.  CONCLUSION OF WHAT IS IMMEDIATELY NEEDED FOR THE BEST\nINTERESTS AND PROTECTION OF THE RESIDENTS, TO SAFEGUARD\nTHEIR WELFARE, AND PREVENT FURTHER VIOLATION OF THEIR\nRIGHTS\nIt is with much thought; painful deliberations; data gathering; consultation with experts;\ninput from staff and contract employees; interviews and observations of all the residents\nat DCV; meetings with District of Columbia government officials; and the employ of a\nnursing home systems expert consultant on January 3, 4, and 5, 1996, (who was also a\nconsultant to the Court Monitor at DCV in September at the time of the Health Care\nFinancing Administration (HCFA) survey and is a former HCFA Regional Survey Team\nCoordinator and currently serving as a consultant to a HCFA contractee and is conducting\nHCFA surveys throughout the country); that the Court Monitor comes to the following\nconclusion:\n\nIn order to protect the residents' health, ensure continuity of care,\nsafeguard the residents* rights according to federal and District law\nand regulations, and protect the residents from the trauma of\nrelocation, a new management team is needed immediately.\nFor the bests interests of the residents of DCV, I base my conclusion on current\nand ongoing conditons and practices which pose serious and widespread danger to the\nhealth and welfare of the residents.\nASSESSMENT DATA SUPPORTING NEED FOR NEW MANAGEMENT\nThe following assessment data relates to the Court Order of December 22, 1995, and\nwhen needed for clarification, the previous Court Orders of July 6 and November 7 are\ncited.  The assessment data and recommendations profiled in the Court Monitor's\nOctober and November Status Reports are still current and valid unless otherwise\nindicated here and the recommendations still stand.  This section of assessment data\nsupporting the need for new management is in addition to the data already presented to\nthe Court.\nA. Outplacement of Residents with Mental Retardation\nThere is no constructive movement in this area.  Currently there is an\nimpasse between the group home providers and the Commission on Health Care Finance\nover a mutually agreed upon rate.  There are not enough identified group homes to care\nfor the particular, individual needs of the residents with mental retardation at DCV.\nGroup homes have not been paid for approximately one half year.  As a result one\nresident with mental retardation, Mr. L.S., who was profiled in the November Status\nReport, has been waiting to be discharged to D.C. Family Services, a group home.  D.C.\nFamily Services is now in a budget crisis of its own and cannot accept this resident until\n\nit is reimbursed for three residents it received from DCV in June. Within the last week, it\ncame to the Court Monitor's attention that Mr. L.S. is still in Washington Nursing\nFacility, the nursing home to which he was discharged after he had an acute care\nprocedure performed at Greater Southeast Hospital Center, where he was transferred from\nDCV in the autumn.  The Washington Nursing Facility is not where he should be today.\nNot only is this an example of the financial problems which constitute barriers to\nplacement, but it is also an example of a systems breakdown at DCV. All those involved\nwith Mr. L.S., including social service at DCV and the GUCDC assumed that Mr. L.S.\nwas in his designated group home.  However, it has not been determined if Mr. L.S.'s\nindividualized habilitation plan has been sent anywhere.  It is not known if the\nWashington Nursing Facility is capable of caring for the individualized needs of Mr. L.S.\nThe Court Monitor, along with a staff person from the GUCDC group, will visit Mr. L.S.\nin his current setting, to determine appropriateness of care and level of staff knowledge.\n(A visit was scheduled last week, but was rendered impossible by the blizzard.)\nThere has been no movement in identifying and developing the specialty\nconsultation team described in the November 30 Status Report to the Court and\nreiterated in the December 22, 1995, Court Order.  At a meeting at DCV on Thursday,\nDecember 28, 1995, with Dr. Harvey Sloane, Commissioner of Public Health for the\nDistrict of Columbia; Dr. Guido Zanni, Commissioner of Mental Health for the District\nof Columbia; Ms. Orlene Grant from the Commission of Mental Health Office; Ms.\nGladys Fountain, Interim Administrator for Long Term Care from the Commission of\nPublic Health; and the Executive Director of DCV, the Court Monitor reiterated this fact.\nThe response from the Executive Director of DCV was that the residents with mental\nretardation have case managers at the Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities\nAdministration (MRDDA) and they are handling this.  The Court Monitor's October 16,\n\n1995, Status Report to the Court on page 26-27 identifies the inadequacy of this situation.\nTo this date, nothing has changed.\nOn the morning of December 29, 1995,1 met in the hallway at DCV, the psychologist\nfrom the Georgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC), who was\ndismayed and annoyed at the continued treatment GUCDC receives. He informed me\nthat when the GUCDC staff left for work that morning, they had no idea if this would be\ntheir last day because the GUCDC contract expired that day and had not been renewed.\nIn fact one GUCDC staff person began packing his books.  It was only later that morning\nthat GUCDC staff at DCV received a letter by courier stating that their contract was\nbeing renewed until January 12. The Court Monitor immediately went to the Executive\nDirector of DCV with this staff person from GUCDC and reported this to her.  The\nExecutive Director's response was, \"you do not understand bureaucracy.\"  The Court\nMonitor reminded the Executive Director, \"my role is to report the life of the residents to\nthe Court, and this is detrimental to the life of the residents.\" I also reminded the\nExecutive Director that the District is now in contempt of the Court Orders, and that she\nhas to let the Court Monitor help her help the residents, stop defending a system that is\nnot defensible, and defend the residents by being vocal and advocating for what is needed\nto protect and safeguard the residents health and welfare.\nThe Executive Director in the presence of the Court Monitor and the GUCDC staff\nperson called MRDDA and was informed that the GUCDC contract had in fact expired\nand that GUCDC would be renewed after January 12, 1996, at 14 day increments.\nI continue to remain greatly concerned about the adequacy of the group\nhomes to appropriately provide for the individual needs of the remaining residents with\nmental retardation at DCV.  On December 15,1995,1 visited one proposed group home\n\nsite with the president of the group home, Kennedy Institute. The plans were to rely on\naides to provide the bulk of care and to be supervised by a Licensed Practical Nurse\n(LPN).  The turnover rate for aides in group homes is generally acknowledged to be every\nthree months. I asked what contingency plans do they have when aides do not show up\nfor work, and was told that they have about a 95% success rate with a back-up list.\nFactored into the staffing plans were the provisions that the residents would be away\nfrom the home for six hours a day at day programs.  But in fact the group home provider\nadmitted that there are not really adequate or appropriate day programs for the DCV\npopulation of residents with mental retardation.  However, he did express that the group\nhomes that do accept this population could be creative and perhaps share the resources of\nthe specialty consult team to provide that appropriate day programs, much as GUCDC is\nnow doing at DCV.\nThis group home provider said that given the severe health needs of the residents with\nmental retardation at DCV, group homes cannot accept these residents without access to a\nspecialty consult team.  He also said that Catholic Charities of D.C., which runs the\nKennedy Institute, is approximately $1,000,000 in debt from lack of payment by the\nDistrict for the seven group homes it runs.\nExcept for one resident currently on Unit 2B with a one to one nurse aide\nassignment, the remaining eleven residents with mental retardation are on Unit 5A. The\ntotal current census on Unit 5A is sixteen residents. The current usual staffing pattern for\nday, evening, and night shifts on Unit 5A is to have one licensed nurse staff and two\nnurse aides.  Usually, in a nursing home with a resident population of 16, this would be\nadequate.  However, given the individualized attention the residents with mental\nretardation need in accordance with their individual habilitation plans, I now believe this\n\nstaffing pattern is inadequate on the evening, night, and weekend shifts when the\nGUCDC staff are not present.  Group home staffing patterns are planned at one aide to\nfour residents.\nThe Court Monitor met with the program coordinator for the GUCDC, Mr. Richard\nClevenger, on January 5, 1995, at DCV. We discussed the above situations. Mr.\nClevenger suggested that GUCDC explore hiring their own aides to complement staffing\non Unit 5A. It would be much more cost effective than the amount DCV is presently\npaying for nurse aides.  In addition, GUCDC would have greater access to educating and\nsupervising the aides in the care of the residents with mental retardation.  Also, these\nresidents would have assured continuity of care, which is so important and is not\nconsistently the case now.  According to Mr. Clevenger, GUCDC has considerable\nexperience in hiring, training, and supervising \"habitation aides\" for a similar population\nin other settings.\nIn a meeting that same afternoon with Mr. Silas Butler, the Deputy Administrator of DCV\nand Mr. Clevenger, the Court Monitor informed and discussed all the above with Mr.\nButler.  Mr. Clevenger recommended that the GUCDC offices be moved from the second\nfloor of an attached building, for the most part inaccessible to the residents with mental\nretardation, to Unit 5A.  Mr. Butler said he would immediately put those plans into effect.\nHistorically at DCV, the GUCDC staff has not been included as an integral part of the\nlife of the residents with mental retardation, including full participation in care planning\nand the planning of the residents outplacement.  It is my understanding from interviews\nand reading past memos and letters, including those from the Pratt Monitoring Program\nand Georgetown University to the administration at DCV, that the administration,\nnursing, and social services  departments have been resistant to expertise beyond theirs.\n8\n\nThe Court Monitor told Mr. Butler, who is charged with coordinating the outplacement\nprocess for all residents, that GUCDC should be attending the weekly, Wednesday\nmorning outplacement meetings, and that I have invited Mr. Clevenger to do so. Mr.\nButler has agreed to this.\nThe medical assessments for the three identified residents in the December\n22, 1995, Court Order is a current example of lack of consultation with and integration\nof the program expertise in mental retardation supplied by the GUCDC at DCV.  On\nJanuary 5, 1996,1 asked the Medical Director (MD) about these medical assessments.\nShe informed me that the assessments had been conducted earlier in the week.  The MD\ndid not consult with nor ask GUCDC for references and names of medical doctors who\nknow the residents, who have expertise in mental retardation, and who have knowledge of\ncare that can be provided in group homes.  Instead, without collaborating with the\nGUCDC experts, the MD sought out two medical doctors who do not know the residents.\nNot collaborating with and coordinating expertise is a detriment to the residents.\nThis is not an isolated example. There is virtually no interdisciplinary coordination and\ncooperation at DCV.  Secrecy and defensiveness is rampant among department heads and\ntrickles down to staff in most all departments.  A notable exception was the fine team\nwork of the physical therapists, and ironically, their contract has expired and to date has\nnot been renewed.  The outplacement of residents with mental illness provides another\nexample.\nB.  Issues with Respect to the Discharge and Outplacement of Residents with Mental\nIllness\nDCV has employed the services of Geriatric Psychological Systems (GPS) to conduct the\npsychosocial assessments of residents.  GPS is a consulting firm with presence in several\n\nnursing homes in the District.\nGPS will review the Minimum Data Set which is the federally mandated individual\nassessment tool to be used as a basis for developing the individualized care plans, which\nare also mandated by federal law and regulations.\nThe GPS team consists of a nurse, social worker, psychologist, psychiatrist, and a finance\nperson to determine Medicare Part B reimbursement eligibility.  The psychologist is\nscheduled to conduct evaluations of residents with psychiatric diagnoses based on the\nfindings from the Minimum Data Set assessments.  Then the psychiatrist is scheduled to\nreview psychotropic medications, based on the psychologist recommendations.\nThe ombudsperson has had concerns in the past with the psychiatrist chosen by GPS and\nand in July 1995, filed a complaint with the local licensing authority.  These complaints\nconcerned non-visits to residents and questioned appropriateness of medications ordered.\nThe complaints were investigated by the local licensing authority and HCFA and were\nsubstantiated.  These concerns were shared with the GPS administrator who said that he\nhad heard concerns raised before about the psychiatrist.  The GPS administrator went on\nto say that the psychiatrist has essentially a good Medicare reimbursement record.\nOn December 27, 1995, the GPS consulting team met with staff at DCV. After the\nmeeting, the Court Monitor met with GPS staff and shared the Court Orders and the\nStatus Reports to the Court.  The regional president of GPS told the Court Monitor,\n\"Your November 30 report outlines our work completely.\"\nIt is unclear to date how needed psychiatric therapies will be conducted on an ongoing\nbasis as long as the residents remain at DCV. Further monitoring is required.\n10\n\nMy concerns with the outplacement of residents with mental illness, in addition to those\nalready presented to the Court in previous reports, are two-fold.  (1) The manner in which\nthe consulting firm was chosen is symptomatic of the pervasive attitude of non-\ncollaboration among departments, defensiveness to constructive input, secrecy and lack of\nsharing of information; (2) I see no way under the current structure for outplacement of\nresidents that the recommendations of GPS will be systematically incorporated into the\ninterdisciplinary discharge plans and communicated to the outplacing facilities.\n(1) On the afternoon of December 19, 1995, an outplacement meeting took place\nat DCV specifically to discuss the outplacement of residents with mental illness.\nAttending and chairing the meeting was the Deputy Administrator for DCV, the Chief of\nthe Central Referral Bureau for the District of Columbia (who is a member of the\noutplacement and attends all the weekly meetings), the Ombudsperson, the Medical\nDirector, and the Court Monitor.\nThe Deputy Administrator at DCV has been charged with overall oversight of the\noutplacement process. He in turn designated the Medical Director to oversee the\noutplacement of residents with mental illness primarily because, at the Deputy\nAdministrator's own admission, he does not know much about mental illness.  However,\nat her own admission, the Medical Director said she does not know much about mental\nillness either.\nThe Medical Director was asked to present an update on the outplacement of residents\nwith mental illness.  This presentation indicated little understanding of the seriousness of\nthe deficiencies in the care at DCV and the deficiencies of the available resources within\nthe District to adequately care for this population.  This, despite the fact that the Court\nMonitor met with the Medical Director a month beforehand and outlined for her a path to\n11\n\nfollow to appropriately outplace residents with mental illness. This information is\noutlined in the November Status Report in the section on 'Outplacement of Residents\nwith Mental Illness'.\nOn my way out the door of the facility that evening, the Medical Director informed me\nthat GPS was expected at DCV the next day for an interview.  I do not understand the\nunwillingness to share this information in the appropriate meeting and to receive input for\nthe best interests of the residents with mental illness.  It was at the Court Monitor's\ninsistence to the Deputy Administrator that the Ombudsperson and the Chief of the\nCentral Referral Bureau attend this meeting.  These two have years of knowledge of the\ndifficulties in outplacing this population and are members of the outplacement team.\nAt a meeting at DCV on the evening of December 28 with Dr. Harvey Sloane,\nCommissioner of Public Health, District of Columbia; Dr. Guido Zanni, Commissioner of\nMental Health, District of Columbia; the Executive Director of DCV; and the Interim\nAdministrator for Long Term Care for the District, the Medical Director objected to the\nprovisions in the December 22, 1995, Court Order specifically relating to providing\nconsultation services to receiving facilities to ensure safe and effective transition to new\nresidences.  This objection demonstrates a lack of awareness of the seriousness of a\ncontempt citation and a professional entrenchment which clouds objectivity.\nI do believe that charging the Medical Director to oversee outplacement of the residents\nwith mental illness is not a positive use of her considerable strengths in the areas of home\ncare and hospice care.  I, therefore, recommend that oversight of the outplacement of\nresidents with mental illness be given to Ms. Corrie Kemp, Chief of the Central Referral\nBureau for the District of Columbia.  In this capacity, Ms. Kemp has current knowledge\nof all the caregiving sites in the District, their strengths and weaknesses, their abilities to\n12\n\ncare for the residents with mental illness, and what licensure and regulatory requirements\nmay be needed to facilitate the ability of certain sites to prepare to receive this special\npopulation.\n(2) Current management structure at DCV does not provide for the incorporation\nof the data and recommendations expected from GPS into the interdisciplinary discharge\nplans and the follow up communication to the outplacing facilities.\nThe outplacement of residents is currently coordinated by the social services department.\nThe head of the social services department has been observed telling clinical nurses on\nthe units that psychosocial assessments have already been done. There have been\nvirtually no current psychosocial assessments conducted for the residents, despite the\nprotestations from the social services department.  This leads me to the following\nadditional concerns.\nC.  General Discharge and Outplacement Issues\nThe Action Steps described in the November 30 Status Report, which DCV initiated and,\nat that time, indicated a commitment to continue, have not been continued.\nThere have been no further meetings since the November meeting with residents,\nrelatives, and responsible parties, although, DCV committed to scheduling these meetings\nfor December and January.\nCounseling residents and staff began and ended in December.  There has been no\ninvolvement of other disciplines, such as, dietary and therapeutic recreation in the\noutplacement process.\n13\n\nThe only leadership to date in the outplacement process has come from the Associate\nDirector of Nursing, Ms. Disu.  However, since she has been out on emergency medical\nleave, all the action steps identified in the November 30 Status Report have stopped.  The\nsocial service department has taken no leadership in counseling residents and staff and in\ncoordinating with other departments the individual interdisciplinary discharge care plans.\nResidents discharged from the hospital to a skilled unit within the same hospital have not\nhad their discharge care plans sent from DCV.  Ms. H.W. and Mr. H.J. are two recent\nexamples.  In these two instances, the ombudsperson was not notified of the residents\noutplacement.\nOn January 4, 1996,1 received a telephone call from the nephew of resident Ms. H.D.\nThe nephew, Mr. D.D.,  had received a call the week before from the administrator of the\nSkilled Nursing Facility a few blocks from DCV, pressuring the nephew to authorize\noutplacement of his aunt that day. Mr. D. wants his aunt outplaced to Carroll Manor\nwhich is near his home in Maryland.  Mr. D. was told by the administrator that Mr. D's\naunt could go the administrator's facility and when a bed opens at Carroll Manor, she\ncould be transferred.  Mr. D. wanted to know, if it was necessary to immediately outplace\nhis aunt against his wishes, which would cause needless trauma to Ms. H.D. This is\nundue pressure on residents and family members and is a violation of their rights.\nThe nursing homes identified for outplacement have a primary motivation to receive\nreimbursement, therefore, the residents rights have to be protected.\nD.  Measures to Remedy Shortages\nUnder the current management structure, shortages continue to occur which pose serious\nharm to the health and welfare of the residents.  A few examples follow.\n14\n\nPhysical Therapy  On December 14,1 asked the Executive Director if she knew if\nthe physical therapy contract had been renewed.  She said that she did not.  I asked if she\nknew that the physical therapist had not been paid.  She said that she did not.  The\nExecutive Director said she would follow up on the matter and get back to me.\nOn Thursday late afternoon, December 28, 1995, the physical therapist, while leaving\nDCV, told the Court Monitor that she was on her way downtown to sign an extension\nuntil January 9, of her contract which expired that next day, December 29.  The physical\ntherapist told me that the contracts for physical therapy services would be up for open\nbidding; that she had no idea if she would be servicing DCV after January 9, 1996; and\nthat TMS Management Services, the physical therapy vendor, had not been paid.\nAt the December 28 evening meeting described earlier with the Commissioner of Public\nHealth\" for the District; the Interim Administrator for Long Term Care for the District; the\nCommissioner of Mental Health for the District; and the Executive Director of DCV, the\nCourt Monitor raised the serious issue concerning physical therapy services.  The\nExecutive Director said she was \"completely on top of it\" and that the physical therapist\nwas going to have her contract renewed today.  I asked if the she knew for how long, and\nthe Executive Director said until January 9.  And then I asked what would happen after\nJanuary 9.  The Executive Director said, \"I don't know.\"  The Interim Administrator for\nLong Term Care said it is \"contract procedure\" to have open bidding and that the physical\ntherapist may not be the same one, but that there would be physical therapy services.\nThe Court Monitor told the meeting attendees, that this means one of three scenarios.\nOne, that there will be no physical therapy services at DCV after January 9, two, that\nthere will be an interruption of services, and/or, three, that there will be a lack of\ncontinuity in services by supplying a new contract vendor.  Any of the above is\n15\n\nunacceptable and intolerable for the health and welfare of the residents.  Dr. Sloane, the\nCommissioner of Public Health for the District of Columbia shook his head and said to\nthe Interim Administrator for Long Term Care, Ms. Gladys Fountain, \"this isn't right, see\nwhat you can do.M\nAs of this writing, there is no physical therapist at DCV.\nOccupational Therapy  Since October 24, 1995, there has been an outstanding\nrequest for a purchase order for needed supplies for hand splints to prevent further\ncontractures in residents.  The causes of contractures and the serious jeopardy\ncontractures of both hands and legs pose to residents health have been profiled in\nprevious Status Reports to the Court.  Development of contractures stems from passive\nneglect which over time is chronic abuse. According to occupational therapy staff, the\nMedical Director'and the Executive Director were given these requests for purchase\norders in October.  To date, there are no supplies at DCV to make hand splints to prevent\nfurther contractures of residents hands. Among many other normal daily human\nactivities, contractures of hands have serious health consequences relating to  preventing\nresidents from feedings themselves, attending to personal hygiene, such as, grooming,\ntoileting, brushing teeth, and drinking water for hydration.\nProcurement  In a meeting at DCV on December 22, 1995, with Mr.Vernon\nHawkins, Director of the Department of Human Services for the District of Columbia; the\nCommissioner of Public Health for the District; the Interim Administrator for Long Term\nCare for the District; the Executive Director and the Deputy Administrator of DCV; and\nthe Court Monitor, Mr. Hawkins said that he would be detailing Ms. Cheryl Perkins from\nthe Procurement Office in the Department of Human Services of the District of Columbia\nto DCV two half days a week, Monday and Wednesday.\n16\n\nAt a meeting in Mr. Hawkins office on the campus of St. Elizabeth's on December 26,\n1995, attended by vendors, the dietary department head at DCV; the Executive Director\nand Deputy Administrator of DCV; the Commissioner of Public Health and the Interim\nAdministrator of Public Health; the Chief of Staff for Mr. Hawkins; and the Court\nMonitor, Mr. Hawkins again reiterated that commencing the following Wednesday,\nJanuary 3, 1996, a representative from the procurement office would be detailed to DCV\nto write purchase orders.\nOn Wednesday, January 3, 1996, the Procurement Office representative, Ms. Cheryl\nPerkins, did not come to DCV.  When the Court Monitor inquired, I was told that Ms.\nPerkins took a leave day.  On January 4,1 left a message for Mr. Hawkins stating my\ndisappointment that he did not send a representative from the Procurement Office as he\nhad said that he would.\nTo date there has been no representative from the Procurement Office at DCV.\nE.  Food and Drink  (Stipulated Court Order, July 6.1995)\nDefendants shall immediately ensure that sufficient supplies of nutritious and\nappropriate food and drink are consistently maintained at DCV and that each\nresident daily receives adequate, well-balanced, nutritious and appropriate food and\ndrink according to their individual nutritional needs.\nStatus Re: Court Order  Non-Compliance\nTwo experts in dietary services and nutrition from the Department of Nutritional\nSciences, Howard University, in the District of Columbia,  served as consultants to the\nCourt Monitor.  The expert consultants were at DCV on December 27, 28, 29, 1995, and\nJanuary 2,3,4, and 5,1996.  I urge the reader of this Status Report to go to Appendix B\nfor the complete report of the nutrition experts.\n17\n\nThe major findings of the food and nutrition experts are the following.\nInservice\nThere is No Inservice on resident care, diet and nutrition.  The last documented\ninservice in this area was in 1993. This is a violation of federal regulations and\nprofessional standards of practice.\nPolicies and Procedures\nThere are No Policies and Procedures.\nThe Policy and Procedures Manual was incomplete and outdated.\nPolicies and Procedures were lacking in the following critical areas of resident care and\nfood service management:\n1.  Decubitus ulcer protocol;\n2.  Documentation of food consumption;\n3\".  Hydration schedule;\n4.  Unplanned weight loss;\n5.  Menu analysis;\n6.  Menu Substitutions;\n7.  Staffing pattern;\n8.  Job descriptions;\n9.  Employee scheduling;\n10. Employee orientation;\n11.  Purchasing procedures;\n12. Emergency food and beverage supplies;\n13.  Re-assessment of post-hospitalized residents.\nThere is a lack of uniformity in resident care management.\n18\n\nFood Service Systems\nIn order to ensure that sufficient supplies of nutritious and appropriate food and drink\nare consistently maintained an effective procurement system and an effective inventory\ncontrol system are required.  The food and nutrition experts found that DCV did not have\ninventory records which would: provide accurate information of food and supplies in\nstock; determine purchasing needs; provide data for food cost control; and prevent theft\nand pilferage.  Findings also included no storeroom requisition files, no purchasing\nmanual, and no policies and procedures concerning purchasing, including receiving,\nstorage, and inventory control.\nMenus\nThe food and nutrition experts found that in the area of the preparation of menu items in\nthe needed quantity and with the desired quality, there are major violations of standards\nof professional practice.  Three of the critical areas are the following:\n(1) Food service personnel are not using recipes to determine portion sizes;\n(2) Smaller portion serving utensils are being used for food items on resident trays,\nwhen larger portion sizes are necessary for adequate nutrition;\n(3) Consistent with findings in the November 30 Status Report, portion sizes are\nnot on menus, production sheets, nor recipes.  Therefore, according to the food and\nnutrition experts the nutritional status of the residents is at risk.\nConsistent with the findings of the HCFA surveyors in September 1995, there are more\ndiets prescribed than probably any nursing home in the country.  The experts found 20\ndifferent diets, many very restrictive.  This is contrary to current dietary and nutrition\npractices in nursing homes today.  Physician diet prescribing practices do not reflect\ncurrent knowledge of nutritional health for nursing home residents.  Restrictive diets lead\nto diminished food intake and  increased use of supplements, and can lead to increased\n19\n\nuse of gastric tubes prescribed for feeding.  Whereas, resident satisfaction and improved\nfood intake are associated with more liberal diet policies.  I have yet to hear a resident\nexpress satisfaction with the meals at DCV.\nThere is a heavy prescribing of and reliance on gastric tubes at DCV. Gastric tubes are\nplaced directly into the stomach for feeding.  There is a body of literature on iatrogenic\nmalnutrition, which is malnutrition induced by physicians.\nClinical Nutrition Care Management\nChart reviews for clinical nutrition care management provided the following findings.\n(1) In all charts reviewed, there were no records of food consumption and fluid\nconsumption, typically called intake and output records.  The experts say that a record of\nfood and fluid intake is a standard practice for nutrition care management.  \"With only an\noccasional notation, it is virtually impossible to assess the nutritional adequacy of a\nresident's food and fluid intake.\" Monitoring fluid intake is vital to adequate hydration of\nnursing home residents.\n(2) There is an excessive reliance on dietary supplements which are associated\nwith decreased appetite and food ingestion.\n(3) Nearly half of the residents identified to receive increased fluid intake had no\ninterventions listed on the care plan in their charts, and had no increased fluids on their\nmeal trays.\n(4) Significant weight loss or gain is not adequately addressed by dietary with no\ninterdisciplinary collaboration and follow-up.\n(5) A number of care plans were inaccurate or inadequate.\n(6) One third of the annual nutrition assessments did not contain significant data\nabout the residents.\n20\n\nMeal Observation and Tray Accuracy\nA consistent pattern of tray inaccuracies was found.  For example, Mr. C.F. is to\nreceive a high fiber diet and cranberry juice, and yet he consistently receives white bread\ninstead of wheat bread and rarely receives cranberry juice. He is often told by the dietary\ndepartment that cranberry juice is \"too expensive.\" The experts say that cranberry juice\nis not expensive.\nRecommendations\nSome of the recommendations from the experts based on critical deficiencies posing\nserious harm to residents health and welfare are the following .\n(1) Needed ongoing continuing education by the professional community.\n(2) \"Establish and implement an effective and consistent program of hydration\nincluding a Hydration Policy to ensure uniform approaches in the prevention and\ntreatment of dehydration.  Both Nursing and Dietary Departments will need to collaborate\nto devise  policy and procedures.\"\n(3) Implement food and fluid intake assessment procedures.\n(4) Comply with Residents' Rights by posting menus on each unit.\n(5) Implement a \"more uniform and aggressive approach to addressing significant\nunplanned weight changes.\"\n(6) Adopt a \"uniform and systematic interdisciplinary care program to reflect a\nmore integrated approach\" to resident care.\n(7)  Establish a Quality Assurance program reflective of professional standards of\npractice and federal and District law and regulations.\nThe food and nutrition experts and the Court Monitor found an alarming and troublesome\nattitude among staff which was also voiced by the Interim Administrator for Long Term\nCare for the District, when I introduced the nutrition experts to her.  That is, that since\n21\n'i  if\n\nDCV is closing at the end of March, what is the point of looking at operations.\nAnother dismaying attitude is that instead of viewing the food and nutrition experts to the\nCourt Monitor as possible sources of professional growth and as colleagues to learn from,\nespecially the experts from Howard University here in the District of Columbia, the head\nof the dietary department called the Corporation Counsel complaining about the data they\nwere being asked to review.\nSummary\nIn summary, the food and nutrition expert consultants to the Court Monitor believe that\nnutrition can make a difference between life and death and that the lives of the residents\nof D.C. Village Nursing Home are at risk.\nF.  Provision of Health and Nursing Care\nThere is, once again, virtually no leadership in the nursing department.  The Director of\nNursing (DON) hired three months ago has left employ at DCV. A nurse from the\nCommission of Public Health has been detailed to serve as acting DON.\nAlthough the District's goal for outplacement of over 220 residents is March 31, 1996,\nthis is not realistic.  I foresee the facility open through at least a good part of 1996. The\nCommissioner of Public Health concedes that there are approximately 70 residents who\nwill be virtually impossible to outplace. It is not acceptable to have an acting DON. The\nresidents need immediately competent, consistent, and stable nursing leadership and\nnursing staff for as long as they remain in their homes at DCV.\nThe one leader in nursing administration has been on emergency sick leave since before\nChristmas.  Since her emergency surgery, the announcement over the public address\n22\n\nsystem every two hours to turn residents has stopped.  The interdisciplinary counseling\nsessions regarding transfer trauma for staff and residents has stopped.  The therapeutic\nmusic played over the public address system has stopped.  A nursing facility cannot run\non the strength of one committed, caring, knowledgeable leader alone.\nThere are few permanent licensed nurse staff left.  The licensed nurse staff on the units\nare, for the most part, from contract agencies.  I have found in discussions with the\nmanagement of the contract nurse staffing agencies, that most of them are not aware of\nthe Nursing Home Reform Law and the minimum standards for long term care as\nexemplified in the federal regulations.\nThe clinical contract nurses are not pennanently assigned to units, and, therefore, are not\ninvolved in the life of the residents.  They do not know the residents, nor do the residents\nknow them.  Two residents of DCV for many years, Mr. M.W. and Mr. C. F., the\nPresident of the Residents' Council, were asked who their clinical nurse coordinators are\non their respective units. Neither one knew the answer.  This is unacceptable for a long\nterm care facility.  To be sure, there are a few contract staff who are usually assigned to\nthe same units and who are also providing good care.\nThe nurse aides on the units are essentially without supervision.  The contract nurse staff\ndo not supervise the nurse aides, and, when they try to, for the most part are ignored by\nthe nurse aides. This is an intolerable practice and a danger for the health and welfare of\nthe residents. All nursing staff, including nurse aides, must have job descriptions,\nperformance evaluations, and expectations of performance for retention of position.  In\nthe December 22,1995, meeting with Mr. Vernon Hawkins, Director of the Department\nof Human Services for the District of Columbia, Mr. Hawkins said that he realized there\nis a tension between contract staff and nurse aides.\n23\n\nWithout leadership from nursing administration, the clinical coordinators do not receive\nthe supervision they need.  The rehabilitation potential of the residents is not realized.\nExamples of evidence of this is the presence of  contractures, incontinence and the level\nof bowel and bladder rehab programs, as well as the lack of physical therapy professional\nservices to provide leadership to the ten physical therapy aides in areas such as\nperforming range of motion exercises.  This is unacceptable for a long term care facility.\nThis is all described in previous Status Reports to the Court.\nIt is time to enforce the Appropriate Nursing Staff provisions of the Stipulated Court\nOrder of July 6,1995.\nDecubitus Ulcers  Before the emergency medical leave of the Associate Director\nof Nursing (ADON), weekly decubitus ulcer care rounds were initiated on Wednesday\nmornings. These'rounds consisted of the two ADON's, the clinical nurses on the units,\nthe treatment nurses, the Medical Director, and the resident.  It is my understanding that\nthese rounds have now been scheduled to take place once a month because \"they take too\nlong.\"  There are very few more important activities in a nursing home than the\ninterdisciplinary care team rounds conducted at the bedside as frequently as possible.\nInfection Control  The infection control staff person should have her office on a\nresident care unit and should be constantly making rounds on the units and in residents'\nrooms.\nEighty percent of suction equipment placed at the bedside was observed to be dirty.\nPolicies and Procedures for Tube feeding and Hydration must immediately be developed.\nThere are still monthly reports of hospital admissions due to dehydration, infections,\n24\n\npneumonia, sepsis all of which are related to inadequate infection control procedures and\nfollow-up continuous education.  Hospitalizations for these causes also related to lack of\nhydration, lack of adequate hand washing, poor nursing care, and improper incontinent\ncare.  Hospitalizations for dehydration are considered \"immediate jeopardy to resident\nhealth\" according to federal regulations and can be grounds for the imposition of\ntemporary management.\nResidents are in need of better grooming.  For example, residents were observed with\ndirty hair and dirty nails.  On the units dirty wheelchairs and dirty geri-chairs were noted.\nPersonal care items must not be placed on the floor as observed.\nEnvironmental rounds were conducted in the Nutrition department on December 13 and a\nform for corrective actions to be taken by December 20. The form was returned to\nQuality Assurance/Infection Control with no identified corrective action taken.\nPharmacy  There are five phannacists at DCV. Not one could provide\ninformation on what residents are on psychotropic medications and what the medications\nare and the dosages, despite the fact this information is required knowledge according to\nfederal regulations.\nThe medication drug pass observations conducted by the pharmacists are frequently based\non insufficient numbers of observations in which to make a conclusion on drug error\npercentages.  The federal regulations state that observations are to be made on 20 to 25\ndoses of medications.  For example, if five residents are on five medications, this would\nfulfill the requirement.  In several instances, observations and conclusions are based on\nzero, two, or five doses of medications.\n25\n\nOne resident, Ms. S.B, has been without a prescribed medication for her hands since\nSeptember.\nAll the Court Monitor's nursing home systems expert consultants have assessed that\nthroughout the country nursing homes the size of DCV have one pharmacist.\nMedications are obtained through a Medicaid contract vendor and are received within\ntwenty-four hours. It is not necessary to have a cumbersome attachment to the pharmacy\nat St. Elizabeth's as is currently the case.\nQuality assurance programs and policies and procedures reflective of a collaborative\nrelationship with medicine, nursing and other departments are lacking.  (This is true for\nall departments in other areas as well.)\nAll the Court Monitor's nursing home systems expert consultants have found DCV\ndepartments divided, isolated, and with no collaborative approach.\nSocial services  These comments are in addition to comments about social\nservices in the Outplacement sections of this report.  One resident, a young man who is\nwheelchair bound, is in obvious need of dental attention.  He has been a resident of DCV\nsince 1982. The nursing homes systems expert consultant to the Court Monitor earlier\nthis month asked him if he would like his teeth fixed.  He said that if his teeth were fixed\nhe would not have to repeat himself so much and tears came to his eyes. There is also a\nfull-time Dentist at DCV.  It is a violation of the medical social services requirements in\nthe federal regulations not to have coordinated dental services for this young man.\n26\n\nIV.  IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS\nA.  Mental Retardation\nGUCDC move their offices immediately to Unit 5 A, where the residents\nwith mental retardation live.\nB.  Mental Illness\nThe Chief of the Central Referral Bureau assume leadership for\ncoordinating the outplacement of residents with mental illness.\nC.  Outplacement\nThe head of the Social Services Department be removed from involvement\nin the outplacement process and leadership for outplacement from the social services be\ntransferred to Ms. Betty Blythe.\nD.  Nursing Care\nContract nurse staffing vendors and their contract staff receive immediate\ninservice from the professional community on the Nursing Home Reform Law and the\nfederal regulations which outline the minimum requirements for standards of practice for\nnursing home care.  The vendors will assure that no contract staff is sent to DCV without\nthis continuing education.  While at DCV, the contract staff must be supervised.\nV.  POTENTIAL MODELS FOR NEW MANAGEMENT\nI am drawing upon the expertise of professionals in long term\ncare and nursing home operations to propose models to the Court used in other parts of\nthe country. Many of the consultants to the Court Monitor live in the District, know\nDCV, have local, national, and international reputations, and are vitally concerned about\nthe health and welfare of the residents.\nA new management team should have the ability to hire and fire personnel.  Front\n27\n\nline caregiving staff should be given the opportunity to be retained if they meet and agree\nto specific performance criteria.\nThere are professional association lists of qualified management teams, as well as\nfederal government teams, and the potential for a creative use of local talent.  These will\nbe researched and presented to the Court immediately.\nOn Saturday, January 13, 1996,1 met with Dr. Harvey Sloane, Commissioner of\nPublic Health for the District and shared with him my assessments and conclusion for the\nneed of new management at DCV.\nOn Monday, January 15, 1996, at Dr. Sloane's initiative, Dr. Sloane and the Court\nMonitor met with Dr. Philip Lee, the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services\nin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The purpose of the meeting was\nto share with Dr. Lee the situation at DCV.  The D.C. Initiative, the intent of which is to\nexplore how federal agencies may be of service to the District, is under Dr. Lee's Office.\nThe Court Monitor gave copies of  the Court Orders and the Status Reports to Dr. Lee,\nwho said he would explore the use of Commissioned Corps personnel to serve at DCV.\nOn Tuesday, January 16, 1996, a conference call was held with Mr. Vernon\nHawkins, Director of the Department of Human Services for the District, Dr. Sloane, the\nCommissioner of Public Health, and the Court Monitor.  Mr. Hawkins shared with the\nCourt Monitor his conceptual thinking regarding a management team for DCV.\nAccording to Mr. Hawkins, his thoughts include bringing in a management team to lead\nthe nursing and dietary departments, and outside consultation for medical care. Mr.\nHawkins' plans include detailing Ms. Sue Brown, currently with the Commission on\nHealth Financing in the District, to supervise \"day to day policy formulation and\n28\n\ndirection,\", to have authority to procure items and \"sign off on personnel action,\" and to\ncoordinate activities of a management team in nursing and dietary.\nMr. Hawkins also said he met with the Chief Financial Officer for the District, Mr.\nAnthony Williams, regarding payment issues at DCV.  Mr. Hawkins was to hear from\nMr. Williams at 5pm, Tuesday, January 16 regarding authorization of payment of\nvendors.  The Court Monitor asked Mr. Hawkins to please call once he heard from Mr.\nWilliams that day. As of this date, I have not heard from Mr. Hawkins.\nThe Court Monitor shared with Mr. Hawkins concerns about his plans.  The first\nconcern is that on December 19, 1995, the Court Monitor called Ms. Sue Brown to\ninquire about financial audits, which would be necessary in order to apply for home and\ncommunity based waivers for the outplacement planning of residents with mental illness.\nMs.  Brown would not speak with the Court Monitor until a representative from the\nCorporation Counsel's office was also a participant in the phone conversation.  I gave Ms.\nBrown the number of Ms.  Barbara Mann, with whom I happened to have just spoken. At\nthe end of the conversation, I told Ms. Brown that I look forward to meeting her.  Ms.\nBrown told me that she does not want to meet any court monitor nor have anything to do\nwith a court.\nI also shared with Mr. Hawkins that more than two departments would need new\nmanagement, and that I do not believe a management team will accept supervision from\nthe District under a Contempt citation.\nConclusion\nI believe the announced closure of DCV by the Mayor and the City Council after the\nStipulated Order of July 6 was filed and the appointment of the Court Monitor, has\n29\n\nundermined the efforts of the Court to improve life for the residents in their homes at\nDCV.\nMy previous assessments of a motivated and caring staff were based on a model\nand assumption of staff independent and separate from the binds of the District\ngovernment.  However, it is now clear to me that DCV is micro-managed from outside its\nwalls and campus; micro-managed from a framework that does not factor in the welfare\nof the residents.  That the framework from which it is micro-managed is fueled by\nprotection of itself and insulation of its member to the detriment of the object of its\nservices - the residents of DCV.  That it produces a closed system, not open to input and\ngrowth for the betterment of and improvement in resident care.\nI now have serious concerns for the health and welfare of the residents.  I believe new\nmanagement at DCV under Court monitoring will protect the residents health and welfare\nand prevent further violation of their rights.\nI do not believe that at present the District of Columbia is capable of directly caring for\nthe residents of DCV nor following the Court Orders. My duty is to present to the Court\nthe life of the residents and the status of compliance of the District with the Court Orders.\nThe Court Orders merely profile decent care practices, which any of us would want for\nour loved ones, and which should be expected of a compassionate society and especially\nof a nursing home in our nation's capital.\n30",

Successful outplacement\nalso will require the development of some new service capacity.\nExisting capacity ia simply not adequate to meet the care needs\nof these residents,  (indeed, if that capacity existed, it is\nlikely that D.C. village's census would be far lower today.)\nPreviously, we were informed by Mr. Vernon Hawkins that the\nCommission on Mental Health Services had agreed to work with D.c.\nVillage to develop placements for those residents requiring\nplacement in a 24-hour staffed residence. (See attached letter.)\nIn addition, at least several local providers have offered to\nconduct assessments and develop individualized treatment plans\nfor DC Village residents.  Now, NCIA is also offering its\nexpertise (see attached letter).  Yet, without effective\ncoordination between DC village, the commission on Mental Health\nservices, other District agencies, and providers and without a\nwillingness to allocate resources to develop alternative settings\nand supports, the outplacement efforts will continue to falter\nand class members will not receive the care and supports they\nneed.\nWe understand that the Court's orders require the District\ngovernment to identify and create a specialty consultant team to\nensure the safe and effective transition of residents with mental\nillness to their new residences.  Given the needs of this\npopulation and the need to develop alternative services, we think\nNCIA or an agency with a similar track record of assessing and\nproviding care to \"hard-to-place\" residents is best suited to\nundertake this task.

District of Columbia\nApnH.,900  •  II IIHIII HI II I II II HI III III III\nNH-DC-001-023\nThe Honorable Thomas F. Hogan\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Avenue, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC  20001\nRe:  The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et aL, Civ. No. 95-948, TFH,\nD.C.  Village Nursing Home (DCV), Court Order, July 6, 1995;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6,1995;\nCourt Order, December 22, 1996;\nCourt Order, February 23, 1996\nDear Judge Hogan:\nI want to assure you that due to the presence of the Court and through the issuance of the Court\nOrders, there are systems in place at DCV which are effecting an appropriate, humane, and dignified\noutplacement of the  residents of DCV to their new homes.  The outplacement process is and will be\nclosely and continually monitored.\nThis letter to the Court primarily focuses on the outplacement process of the residents of DCV to\ntheir new homes. However, it also addresses the defendant's chronic non-compliance of payment of\nvendors.  In addition, this letter to the Court raises my concern regarding the residents' Personal\nNeeds Allowance (PNA) which was first brought to the Court's attention in December.\nOverview of the Outplacement of Residents\nSince September 6,1995, through today, April 2,1996,107 residents have been outplaced.  Of this\nnumber 46 residents have been outplaced since the issuance of the February 23, 1996, Court Order.\nThere are 145 residents yet to be outplaced, of this number it is estimated that there are 40 residents,\nincluding 16 with mental illness, for whom there are no outplacement sites identified to date, and for\nwhom further planning is needed.\nMs.  Sarodel Childs, the District of Columbia Long Term Care Ombudsperson at D.C. Village Nursing\nHome has been instrumental in.reviewing residents' discharge packets, working closely with Ms.\n\nAPR-G3-96 WED 21:37  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949\nP.  03\nCorrie Kemp (the new head of the social services department and the DCV staff person coordinating\nthe discharge process), and helping to ensure that necessary and current information is included, so\nthat the receiving facilities will have appropriate and adequate information to meet the residents1\nindividualized needs.  Ms. Corrie Kemp continues to do an exemplary job.\nThe discharge packets reflect input from the disciplines pursuant to the Court Orders.  Judge Hogan,\nI want you to know, it is refreshing and touching to me that I now hear discussions and plans for the\ndischarge of the residents that profile the residents' lives and reflect input from the staff who know\nand knew the residents best - therapeutic recreation, nurse aides, staff nurses, and in particular\ninstances, social services. This interdisciplinary cooperation now being practiced, which should have\nbeen routine part of care for the residents for years, is directly related to the presence of the Court\nat DCV and the issuance of the Coun Orders.  It is helping effect an individualized and appropriate\noutplacement of the residents.  lx is vital to continue to monitor the outplacement process in order\nto ensure the residents rights are protected.\nThe Court Monitor has visited some of the outplacement sites to date and has witnessed care being\ngiven with knowledge of the individual residents' needs, likes and dislikes which contributes to the\nresidents' quality of care and quality and life.  The Court Monitor will continue to visit outplacement\nsites especially for residents outplaced before the issuance of the February 23 Court Order.  The\nombudspersons role is to conduct follow-up visits to residents outplaced, which they do.  In addition,\nthe therapeutic recreation staff at DCV have been visiting residents outplaced and reporting at the\nweekly Wednesday outplacement meetings the status of the residents outplaced and identifying areas\nrequiring further follow-up.  For example, a recent finding by the therapeutic recreation staff  is that\nsome residents outplaced do not have their Personal Needs Allowance (PNA).\nThere have been ten deaths of DCV residents at their outplacement sites, in addition to Mr. Larry\nStanford profiled in the Court Monitor's March 19,1996, letter to the Court.  Nearly all the deaths\nhave occurred among the sickest, frailest, and oldest residents, many of whom had healing decubitus\nulcers. For the most part these residents required skilled nursing care which is why Hadley Hospital\nSkilled Nursing Unit became their new home. I do believe that part of these residents' infirmity was\nrelated to years of neglectful care at DCV profiled in previous reports to the Court, with the presence\nof the Court they received the attention their care needs warranted and the residents have a right to\nand deserve. Nevertheless, with the District of Columbia's  announced closing of DCV, the trauma\nof  transfer  of so physically compromised individuals can unavoidably hasten their death.  The\nliterature supports the phenomenon of transfer trauma, which was originally brought to the Court's\nattention in my September Preliminary Status Report to the Court.  The Court Monitor has visited\nHadley Hospital Skilled Nursing Unit on two occasions to date and has found staff knowledgeable\nof the individualized care needs of the residents from DCV, the discharge packets helpful to the\nreceiving facility staff, and the residents, dean, satisfied, and appearing to be well cared for.\nApproximately 95 residents are scheduled to be outplaced to Carroll Manor, to date, 31 have been.\nThis past Friday, March 29,1 visited Carroll Manor with one of the Court Monitor's nursing home\nsystems expert  consultants, Dr.  Sharon Mailey from Georgetown University.  Dr. Mailey has\ngeriatric nurse practitioner graduate students at Carroll Manor working with the geriatrician and\n\nAPR-03-96  WED 21:38  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 04\ngeriatric fellows at Carroll Manor. This team is conducting the initial medical assessments and follow-\nups of DCV residents.\nCarroll Manor- is undergoing new management and new ownership.  On Friday, I met with the new\nadministrator and the new director of nursing, explained to them why I was there, told them about\nthe Court Orders, and we openly agreed to meet further to discuss the individualized care needs of\nthe residents. I found them to be very receptive.\nI also visited the DCV residents at Carroll Manor in their rooms and on the units, some of whom had\nbeen outplaced as recently as the day before.  The residents faces did light up at the site of a familiar\nface.  These residents appeared to be happy, clean, well groomed, hair styled, properly positioned in\nwheelchairs, with a brightness and sparkle in their eyes and carriage.  Many were attending a weekly\nscheduled Friday afternoon happy hour.  One recently outplaced DCV resident from Unit 5B, Ms.\nN.S.,  whom I usually saw in bed and weeping, was up, dressed, downstairs and participating in the\nhappy hour.  Ms. N.S. was bright, alert, smiling, talkative, and without tears.\nI sat in on the ongoing medical rounds and the case conference of another DCV resident outplaced\nthe day before.  Participants were the geriatrician at Carroll Manor, Dr. Charles Cefalu,  geriatric\nnurse practitioner graduate students from Georgetown, the geriatric fellows, and Dr. Mailey.  The\nconclusion by this group of experts in long term care was that the dietary, medical, and medication\nmanagement of this recently outplaced DCV resident was inadequate and deficient.  These findings\ncertainly independently corroborate the findings in previous Status Reports to the Court and definitely\nsupport  the findings of the nutrition expert consultants to the Court Monitor from Howard\nUniversity, Department ofNutritional Sciences profiled in the January 17, 1996, Status Report.  For\nexample, this resident on admission to Carroll Manor on March 28 registered an IS pound weight loss\nfrom the last recorded weight taken at DCV at the beginning of March, yet no dietary nor medical\nfollow-up at DCV had been indicated.\nExpert medical management is part of the  routine medical care and follow-up at Carroll Manor.  I do\nbelieve that the residents from DCV outplaced here will be in medically competent hands, that they\nwill  receive medical workups when needed and routine and knowledgeable medical attention,\nsomething consistently lacking at DCV and profiled since the Court Monitor's October Status Report\nto the Court.\nBeginning next week, Providence Hospital Skilled Nursing Unit is scheduled to take between 15 and\n52 DCV residents.\nI want to make it clear to the' Court, that the systems in place pursuant to the Court Order of\nFebruary 23,  provide the best safeguards reasonably and humanly possible to prevent unnecessary\nand tragic circumstances to occur now and in the future.\nResidents with Mental Retardation\nAs of March 8,1996, the Specialty Consultation Team contract for residents with mental retardation\n3\nTBT\n\nAPR-03-96 WED 21:39  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949\nP. 05\nhas been finalized with Georgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC).  This contract\nprovides for GUCDC to offer consultation services off-site to staff at the new homes for residents\nwith mental retardation.  This contract was too late to be of benefit to Mr. Stanford.\nDue to the presence of the Court and the issuance of the Court Orders, systems are now in place and\nhave been and are being implemented to ensure that staff in receiving settings are knowledgeable in\nthe individual care needs of this very special population.  The Specialty Consultation Team is an\nadmirable care model for any jurisdiction to meet the care needs of its most vulnerable population.\nIt is imperative that the Court ordered framework remain in place.  For example, the three very\nmedically fragile residents with mental retardation have been outplaced to Health Care Institute (HCI)\non March 18.  GUCDC has been there for training of staff, and will set up a schedule with HCI for\nongoing consultation. Furthermore, GUCDC is planning to offer a 20 hour training program for nurse\naides at HCI in the special and delicate care needs of this population of residents, and will issue a\ncertificate of completion at the end of the training.\nIn addition, at the approval of GUCDC, direct care staff at DCV, who have cared for the physical\ncare needs of  these residents for years,  accompanied the three medically fragile residents to HCI.\nFor the first week the DCV staff remained at HCI during the day and evening shift and helped the\nHCI staff become accustomed to the individualized physical care procedures and routines necessary\nfor these residents, for example, how to bath, dress, and properly position severely contracted\nresidents with mental retardation.\nMs.  Sarodel Childs, the District of Columbia Ombudsperson at DCV, has visited these residents at\nHCI and reports that they appear, engaged in their environment, dean, and well cared for.\nPlans are in place for two residents to be outplaced to Wholistic group home for residents with mental\nretardation on April 15.  According to Mr. Silas Butler, Deputy Administrator at DCV,  several\novernight and dinner visits are to be scheduled prior to this date so that the residents may be\nacquainted with the surrounding and help provide a more secure transition before actually moving.\nDirect care staff at DCV who know the residents will accompany them on these overnight visits and\nstay with them for several days and nights after outplacement in order that the residents do not\nawaken in the night and become frightened in unfamiliar surroundings, and in order that they see\npeople they have been familiar with for years. Mr. Brady, the psychologist from GUCDC who has\nworked with these particular residents for years, will especially spend time with these residents, Ms.\nAJL and Mr. K.F.  In addition, Mr. K.F. who is also autistic, has a colostomy needing changing in\nthe early moming. The receiving facility staff will be able to observe the techniques necessary to be\nprovided for bis particular and individualized care needs .\nThere is still no agreement on an interim rate between D.C. Family Services (D.C.F.S.) and the\nDistrict  of Columbia.  D.C. Family Services is scheduled to receive six residents with mental\nretardation from DCV.  However, according to Ms. Sheila Gaither, COO. of D.C.F.S., until an\ninterim rate is settled, they cannot accept the residents.  Ms. Gaither did indicate that they have\nnursing staff identified. D.C.F.S,is owed $38,720.24 for January for their Division Street site, where\nthere are three former DCV residents outplaced in June 1995.  D.C.F.S. is owed $9,340.80 for the\n\nAPR-03-9B NED 21:40  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949\nP. 06\nSeptember care of one of these residents, Mr. CM.\nThere remains one resident with mental retardation at DCV, Mr. P.L., for whom no outplacement\nsite has been identified to date.\nResidents with Mental Illness\nThere have been 71 transition care planning meetings for residents who are listed with mental illness\n(the source of the list is still undetermined).  Geriatric Psychological Systems (GPS) participated in\nthese meetings and shared their assessments.  These meetings have been coordinated and chaired by\nMs.  Catherine Carroll who has been detailed from the Commission of Public Health for this task.  Ms.\nCarroll is  an outstanding example of professional behavior and has done an exemplary job.  Ms.\nCarroll exhibits care and compassion for the individual residents and demonstrates fine leadership\nskills. The participants in these interdisciplinary care team meetings were the direct care staff most\nknowledgeable of the residents' lives through the years and described above in paragraph five. In\nmany instances physical therapy and the dietary department also contributed.  In addition, the\nombudsperson, Ms. Sarodel Childs, participated in nearly all of these care planning meetings.\nFrom these meetings, counseling was identified as needed for 27 residents. This counseling has begun\nby GPS.\nLast Thursday, March 28, the Court Monitor and the Court Monitor's expert consultant in geriatric\npsychiatric nursing home systems. Dr. Frieda Butler, reviewed all 71 of the transition care plans and\nshared our input with Ms. Catherine Carroll.  The advice given for the best interests of the residents\nand for compliance with the Court Orders was the following:\n(1) Transition plans reflect a dominance of a medical model not particularly appropriate for\nnursing home care.\n(2) In cases where behavioral care management is indicated as follow-up, in no instance is\nit recommended that a geriatric psychiatric nurse be part  of the follow-up care team.  This is in\nviolation of the Court Order and is not realistic with curren: long term care prartices throughout the\ncountry where geriatric psychiatric nurses are utilized and employed for assessing, monitoring, and\nimplementing behavioral interventions.  It is also cost effective.\n(3) Many of the residents with labels of mental illness have been carrying around this \"stigma\"\nfor decades with no follow-up assessment and update.  In fact, for the most part, the last noted\npsychiatric review and assessment of any kind for the residents took place in 1991.  This is in\nviolation of federal regulations which require annual reviews, despite the fact that there was a full\ntime psychiatrist on staff at DCV from 1991 to the end of 1995.\n(4) Many elderly residents with a history of mental illness \"mellow\" when they are old and\ntheir physical care needs become the dominate requirement for long term care attention.\n\nAPR-03-9B  WED 21:40  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P.07\nMs.  Carroll agreed with the above input and assured the monitor that the transition plans will reflect\nthis advice.\nThe use of GPS as the Specialty Consultation Team for the residents with mental illness has not been\nfinalized, although DCV is moving in this direction.  GPS does have a presence in many nursing\nhomes throughout the metropolitan area which is advantageous. They are also willing to serve in this\nrole.  The Court Monitor will meet with GPS sooa  In addition, according to Ms. Carroll, Carroll\nManor has their own psychiatricteam for their residents.\nResidents Identified for Independent Living\nThere are six residents whose level of care qualify for independent living.  Transition care planning\nmeetings to ensure these residents care needs will be met in the community are taking place this week\nat DCV.  Ms. Catherine Carroll is also taking the lead in coordinating these meetings with the\ninterdisciplinary direct care staff who have known these residents for years. Vocational  rehab\nevaluations are to be scheduled this week for these residents.  No sites have been identified as yet for\nfive of the residents. Mr. C.W. will be outplaced to Green Valley next week.  The Court Monitor will\nkeep the Court informed of the progress in identifying new homes for these residents and that\nappropriate services are in place before outplacement.\nChronic Non-Compliance of Payment of Vendors\nAttached to this letter to the Court'is information in chart form on the status of vendor payment.\nMost  problematic, and for which there is a direct impact on care of the residents, is the non-\ncompliance of the July 6 Court Order, Section C Payment of Vendors, for the contract nurse staffing\nvendors.\nIn my December 6 letter, I brought to the Court's attention the serious non-payment of the contract\nnurse staffing vendor, National Nurses.  This vendor provides the bulk of nurses to DCV.  It is\ndistressing to me that there has been no payment to this vendor since December and once again\nNational Nurses is forced to discontinue service if payment is not received by next week, as indicated\nin the attached letter of April 2 to Mr. Vemon Hawkins, Director, Department of Human Services\nfor the District of Columbia by Mr. Ronald Messenheimer, President of National Nurses. This vendor\nis owed over $200,000..\nTotal Healthcare Resources, Inc. (THR) another nurse staffing vendor has suspended services as of\nMarch 28.  THR is owed approximately $115,000, for services rendered in November, December,\nand January.  The nurses provided by THR at DCV are excellent direct care givers and the residents\nneed their expertise.\nSRT another contract nurse staffing vendor is owed over $88,000.  These vendors are being given\nassurances that they will be paid and in good faith continue vital direct care services for the residents,\nonly to find out time and time again the assurances are hollow.  Of most serious concern is that with\n\nAPR-03-96 WED 21:41  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949\nP. 08\nthe dosing of DCV,  the only reliable source of care for the residents will be contract vendors, since\nmany of the DCV employees are being offered early retirements or early \"outs\" and have left employ.\nCUP, a nurse staffing vendor, was forced to terminate services on April 1, services were reinstated\nApril 2 on reassurances to CUP by Ms. Janette Michaels, the consent decree coordinator for the\nDepartment of Human Services for the District of Columbia, that CUP would be paid this Friday.\nThis reassurance is very problematic to me.\nIn a meeting on Friday, March 22,1996, with the Court Monitor, Mr. Vemon Hawkins and Ms. Sue\nBrown, and with Ms. Michaels in attendance, Mr. Hawkins asked Ms. Michaels about the status of\nvendor payments. Ms. Michaels assured Mr. Hawkins and myself that there were no problems, that\npayments were up to date.  The above and the attached information  indicate that this was a\nmisrepresentation.\nOn the last page of the attached \"DC Village Nursing Home Vendor Report\" a vendor formerly called\nAssociated Healthcare is listed.  This was a contract staff nurse vendor and last provided services at\nDCV in October. Because of chronic late payment this business went bankrupt.  They are still owed\nS6324.34  for services rendered at DCV during part of September and the first week of October\n1995.\nPersonal Needs Allowance (PNA)\nAt a recent weekly Wednesday morning outplacement meeting, the therapeutic recreation staff\nperson, who had visited five residents outplaced to Health Care Institute since September and most\nrecently December 27, reported that these residents did not have access to their PNA.  Ms. Sue\nBrown indicated at this meeting that the residents' PNA was being \"drawn down from the D.C.\nTreasury \" and that \"some monies are not totally transferred.\"  I was shocked.  My December 10\nletter to the Court profiled this problem and in Court on December 20, the defendant represented that\nthis matter had been settled.\nOn March 7,1 wrote the Executive Director of DCV, Ms.'Alberta Brasfield, requesting clarification\nand specific information on all the residents PNA accounts.  Ms. Brasfield promptly responded, for\nwhich I am grateful.  However, the responses raise more questions for me than answers.  I will,\ntherefore, seek further clarification on this matter in order that I may accurately report to the Court\nsoon.  Federal regulations require that residents'PNA be in separate, interest-bearing accounts.  I\nneed to assure myself that this has been, and is, the case for the residents and that they have been\nreceiving all of their money.\nIn the material received from Ms. Brasfield, there is evidence that once residents are outplaced to\ntheir new homes their social security checks have been returned to the Social Security Administration\ninstead of being forwarded to the residents.  In the interest of humanity, I ask DCV to stop this and\nto forward the residents' money directly to them.\n\nAPR-03-96 WED 21:42  NCCNHR  FAX NO. 2023322949  P. 09\nJudge Hogan, it is a privilege to serve the Court and to work with all concerned parties for the best\ninterests of the long term care residents of the District of Columbia.\nSincerely,\n%\nHarriet A.

Hogan\nU.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Ave, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC 20001\nRe:  The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et al., Civ. No. 95-948, TFH,\nD.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV), Court Order, July 6,1995;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6, 1995;\nCourt Order, December 22,1996;\nCourt Order, February 23,1996\nDear Judge Hogan:\nI have obtained a copy of the defendants' pleading submitted to the Court on August 9,1996,\nsubsequent to the statement in Court on August 7. I am writing you, Judge Hogan, to inform you\nthat the defendants' position of terminating monitoring duties September 1 is unreasonable.  It is\nunreasonable because discharge of the residents of DCV is not \"satisfactorily and successfully\ncompleted\" (Court Order, November 7,1995), and will not be so until I can assure the Court that\nall placement(s) are \"appropriate and adequate to meet each person's individualized needs\"\n(Court Order, February 23, 1996).\nI cannot assure the Court that this is true until I have visited the well over two hundred thirty\nresidents from DCV.  Simply because the residents are no longer at DCV does not assume that\nthe District of Columbia has discharged its legal obligations, for which they have so often been in\ncontempt of in this case, to ensure individualized needs are met in a setting adequate and\nappropriate for the resident.\nThe defendants* position is unreasonable for the following reasons:\n(1)  the Court Orders of November 7, December 22, and February 23, specify continuing\nmonitoring until the residents individualized needs are met and that placement is appropriate and\nadequate to meet each resident's individualized needs;\n(2)  summer scheduling difficulties relating to vacations and leaves of key facility staff in\nthe residents' new homes and who have requested meeting with the monitor;\n(3) time required to complete my Final Report to the Court.\n\nAUGH2-96  HON 06:01  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 03\nThe July 6,1995, Court Order appointed the Court Monitor to advise and oversee the defendants'\ncompliance with the Order.  I was appointed August 1, shortly thereafter, the District of Columbia\nannounced closure of D.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV).\nAppropriately and humanely for the best interests of the residents of DCV in order to protect the\nresidents' rights, the Court expanded the duties of the monitor to oversee the outplacement\nprocess which resulted in the November 7 Court Order.  (It is of note that at that time the\ndefendants objected to the expansion of the monitor's duties.)  Monitoring duties were further\nexpanded with the December 22,1995, and February 23,1996, Court Orders.\nI have serious concerns about the adjustment and, therefore, the adequacy of placement of all of\nthe residents and cannot determine if adequate and appropriate services are being provided as\noutlined in discharge packets, and as might be expected from the trauma of transfer, until I see\neach and every resident.  This is a unique opportunity to ensure that the Court Orders are fully\nmet by monitoring the adaptation, adjustment and determining whether DCV residents individual\nneeds as reflected in care plans, assessments, and that needed specialized services are taking place.\nThe February 23, 1996, Court Order states that \"nothing in this order shall be construed to limit\nthe authority and responsibilities of the Monitor...as set forth in the...Court's orders.\"\nIt is important to remember that the trauma of transfer is greater for DCV residents than for the\ngeneral population of nursing home residents in this country.  This is so because the residents had\nno control nor choice in the decision to close the place where they resided, the overwhelming\nmajority of whom had lived at DCV for many, many years, some for decades.  In fact, several of\nthe most medically fragile did not survive the trauma of transfer, the literature documents this\nphenomenon.\nMy concerns relate to the residents with mental retardation, residents with mental illness, residents\ndischarged into the community after years of institutionalized living, and residents now residing in\nother nursing homes.  Judge Hogan, I want you to know I do expect to find the residents healthier\nand happier, but I cannot assure the Court that the defendants have successfully discharged their\nduties until I visit the residents, the new staff as caregivers of the residents, and the new settings\nin which the residents of DCV live.  The following are some examples relating to my concerns for\nthe DCV residents.\nAlthough required to be outplaced in October, 1995, according to the July 6, 1995, Court Order,\nthe residents with mental retardation were outplaced late after many findings of contempt.  One\nresident Mr. P.L. was one of the last to be discharged before closure of DCV.  Mr. P.L. has been\nprofiled in many of my other letters to the Court.  He is residing in a facility which is\ngeographically the farthest away from the District, he also has no family.  He has specialized\ncaregiving needs, such as, feeding, suctioning, and positioning which have to be adhered to\nconstantly to prevent choking and death.  Mr. P.L., a young man, is also in need of day\nprogramming.  At this moment it is unclear what provisions there are for day programming to\n\nAUG-12-96  HON  06:01  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 04\nprovide him with the stimulation required.  The speciality consult team for residents with mental\nretardation visits and works with staff, however, their contract is due to expire September 30,\n1996.  It is imperative that according to the Court Order of December 22 the \"receiving facility\nstaff is stabilized and their competency is demonstrated.\"  This is not known yet and cannot be\nuntil I can assure the Court.\nThe monitoring of the continued adequacy of placement of Ms.  A.R. and Mr. K.F. is required.\nThey reside in a group home that had not previously had residents which exhibited their unique\ncharacteristics, maple syrup disease and pica behavior (a tendency to grab and injest any objects in\nsite), and autistic behavior, respectively.  In addition, the adequacy of their off-site day treatment\nprogram needs to be monitored.\nThe adjustment and adequacy of the group home for the remaining residents with mental\nretardation and the District of Columbia's status in planning for and providing day programming\nservices, especially for Ms. S. A.  and Ms. S.P. as profiled in previous submissions to the Court,\nneeds to be monitored, as well as the adequacy of case management services.  In addition, as\nidentified for Mr. P.L. above, speciality consultation team services need to be maintained until\n\"facility staff is stabilized and their competency demonstrated\" (Court Order, December 22).\nMr. MJ. has taken to wandering out of his new nursing home and has been seen several blocks\naway on a corner drinking with a group of men. While at DCV, Mr. M.J. was retiring and rarely\nleft the unit.  The facility administrator and the director of social services is anxious for me to visit\nthem to discuss Mr. M.J.s identifiable adjustment difficulties.  Mr.MJ. walks slowly with a limp\nand with  the assistance of a cane and is a potential target for criminal preying behavior.  Mr. M.J.\nhas asked that his burial fund be withdrawn, he is in his early forties.  Mr. MJ.'s discharge packet\nrecommended vocational rehabilitation services and to be followed by the specialty consultation\nteam for residents with mental illness.  The administrator has told me that he is having difficulty\ngetting the specialty consult team to see Mr. M.J. and asked for my help.  This DCV resident's\noutplacement is not \"satisfactorily and successfully completed\" (Court Order, November 7) until I\ncan determine that his placement is \"appropriate and adequate to meet (his) individualized needs\"\n(Court Order, December 22). Because of vacation schedules a death in the family of key staff,\nthis facility is unable to meet with me until the end of August.\nThe last residents to leave DCV were the most difficult to outplace.  No facility in the District\nwould accept Mr. J.B. and Mr. H.B. They were outplaced to a nursing home beyond a 50 mile\nradius of DCV.  Mr. J.B. consistently demonstrated acting out and psychotic behavior at DCV.\nHis outplacement discharge plan identified interventions to care for him. The new facility has a\npsychiatric team which is not the specialty consult team identified in the Court Order of December\n22.  With these residents outplaced last, time is needed to determine the adjustment of the\nresidents, whether their individualized needs are met and whether this nursing home is appropriate\nand adequate (Court Orders, December 22,1995, and February 23, 1996) especially for Mr.\nJ.B.'s unique needs.  Only then can it be said that their outplacement has been \"successfully and\nsatisfactorily completed\" (Court Order, November 7,1995).\n\nAUG-12-96  MON 06:02  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 05\nMr. EJ. was discharged from St. Elizabeth's Hospital to DCV and is now residing in a group\nhome for residents with mental illness.  It is unclear at this time, whether the defendants are\nproviding adequate and appropriate services required for Mr. E. J.  as identified at time of\ndischarge, for example, counselling, day programs, case management, nutritional services,\nvocational rehabilitation, safety provisions in the community to prevent wandering and destructive\nbehavior exhibited at DCV.\nMr. C.F. is without the primary medical doctor identified for him by the defendant at the time of\ndischarge from DCV.  When Mr. C.F. first visited the medical doctor in the community identified\nfor him, he was informed by the medical doctor that he would not see him because the medical\ndirector at DCV had not forwarded information to the community medical doctor as the medical\ndirector at DCV indicated she would.  Upon his second visit to the community medical doctor,\nMr. C.F. was told by the community medical doctor that he would not accept Mr. C.F. as a client\nand that he had informed the medical director at DCV of this weeks before.  Another resident also\ndischarged into the community was assigned the same medical doctor by the defendants at time of\ndischarge from DCV.  This resident, Mr. M.W., is primarily wheelchair bound.  Both these\nresidents have complex medical conditions. Discharge is not \"satisfactorily and successfully\ncompleted\" (Court Order, November 7) until the discharge is \"appropriate and adequate to meet\n(their) individualized needs\" (Court Orders December 22 and February 23, 1996).  In a previous\nletter to the Court, I profiled how  another resident discharged into the community, Mr. C.W., if\nnot for the intervention of the Court, would have been discharged by the defendants without\nprovisions for medical follow-up.  All these residents have complex health problems, and as\ninstitutionalized for years, humanely should not be expected to fend for themselves in a maze of\nhealth care providers that even the able-bodied find daunting.\nTo date, the receiving nursing home for Ms. S.B. has been unable to coordinate her various\nmedical appointments in the District and obtain follow-up information from them.  Until this is\ndone, outplacement is not \"satisfactorily and successfully completed\" (Court Order, November 7)\nand \"appropriate and adequate to meet (her) individualized needs\" (Court Orders, December 22\nand February 23,1996.)  Ms. S.B., a quadriplegic, has numerous and complex medical needs\nwhich necessitate coordination and continuity of care which has not yet occurred.\nJudge Hogan, these are just a few examples of some situations that have already come to light and\nwhich indicate that the defendants have not successfully complied with all of the Court Orders.\nOf the approximately 230 residents I anticipate there will be more.  I also anticipate that it will\ntake me limited time to assure the Court that defendants are in compliance with all of the Court\nOrders by ensuring that all the residents \"individualized needs\" are being met, that the\noutplacement is \"appropriate and adequate\" (Court Orders, December 22,1995, and February 23,\n1996),  and then by informing the Court that the outplacement of the residents of DCV \"has been\nsatisfactorily and successfully completed\" (Court Order, November 7, 1995).\nTo take the position of terminating monitoring duties before ensuring that all the residents\n\"indivualized needs\" are being met and that the outplacement is \"appropriate and adequate\"\n\nAUG-42-96  MON 06 = 03  NCCNHR  FAX  NO,  2023322949  P. 06\n(Court Orders, December 22, 1995, and February 23,1996) is callous and insensitive to the needs\nof the residents of DCV.  It is important to be mindful, that it is the defendants who violated the\ncivil rights of the residents of DCV, the District of Columbia's most vulnerable, infirmed, and\npoor.  The Court Monitor was appointed as a result of this (Court Order, July 6,199S).  It is also\nthe defendants who required a Court Order to ensure that the residents have water and cups for\nwater and that the residents and staff have soap (Court Order, December 22). It is the defendants\nwho required a Court Order to provide saline to treat Mr. C.F.'s decubitus ulcer and duoderm for\nMr. J.B. decubitus ulcer, and required a Court Order to turn the residents so they would not\nremain incontinent and sitting in urine on their bedsores with a hole in their bodies to the bone\nwith tissue oozing out as Mr. C.F. and Mr. J.B. had, and who are now deceased (Court Order,\nDecember 22). It is the defendants who allowed Mr. L.R., a young abled- minded man who is a\nquadriplegic, to be imprisoned in his bed for a month because they did not fix his wheelchair.  And\nit is the defendants, whom the Court found on numerous occasions in contempt of all the Court\nOrders in this case.\nDue to vacation schedules of many of the staff who are directly caring for the DCV residents and\nfor management staff who have asked to meet with me in the residents new homes, many of the\nfacilities are unable to meet with me until the end of August and one facility, not until mid\nSeptember. This particular nursing home, has nearly 40 of the sickest DCV residents, this facility\nis preparing for its first Joint Commission accreditation visit at the end of September and\noriginally asked me to visit in early October.  At my urging the soonest appointment I could\nobtain was mid September.  The majority of residents, approximately 90,  are at a nursing home in\nHyattsville, Maryland, just across the District line.  Since the closure of DCV this facility is under\nnew management.  It has taken several weeks for their staff and management to get settled.\nAfter my visits, I anticipate it will take a substantial amount of time to prepare my Final Report to\nthe Court.  I will submit my Final Report by the time of the last Status Hearing in this case.\nMy duty as Court Monitor is to assure the Court that transfer is complete.  I am respectful of the\nCourt's desire to put closure to this case in a timely fashion as is the desire of all the concerned\nparties.  However, my duty and concern is to assure the Court that the residents of DCV\nindividual needs are being met, that the placements are appropriate and adequate, and write and\nsubmit my Final Report to you. I know there are monitoring situations in the District which in my\nopinion are unconscionably prolonged with very little evidence of benefit to the clients.  I assure\nyou, Judge Hogan, I intend to be involved in this case not one day more than what is required to\ncomplete my duties to the Court for the best interests of the residents of DCV.  It is a privilege to\nserve your Court.\nSincerely,\nHarriet A. Fields, Ed.D., R.N.\nCourt Monitor\n\nAUGhl2-96  MON 06:03  NCCNHR  FAX  NO.  2023322949  P. 07\ncc:  Mr. Richard J.

Fields, Ed.D., R.N.\nJanuary 21,1997\n\"It's heaven! I'm  free!\"\n— Mr. C. W. a former  resident of the District of Columbia Village Nursing\nHome upon his outplacement  after 10 years.\nThis is the Final Report in the matter, United States v. District of Columbia, ei al., Civ.\nNo. 95-948 (TFH), Re: D.C. Village Nursing Home (D.C. Village). It chronicles the violation\nof the civil rights of the residents of D.C. Village, the nursing home owned and operated by the\ngovernment of the District of Columbia, and the role the Court played in reversing this injustice.\nThis Final Report profiles how wrongs were righted, how professional behavior - humane\nbehavior in practice - overcame ignorance, indifference, incompetence, and callous disregard for\nthe most vulnerable, .infirmed, and poor among us.\nAlthough this case deals with dying and death, it also draws a portrait of hope, courage,\nand uncommon compassion.  Lives were improved in this case and smiles came to faces long\nfrozen in despair.  The former residents of D.C. Village are now \"free\", their civil rights are no\nlonger violated, they are now tended to with time, commitment and caring, the elements missing\nat D.C. Village.  You can see it in the residents' eyes, happiness has replaced emptiness.\n\nThis Final Report shows how the Court in one year successfully accomplished what the\nDefendants would not or could not do for decades, and in the end, how the Court's active\nintervention was required to effect the humane outplacement of the residents. The shame of it is\nthat the federal Court had to compel an entire civic government to perform its most basic duties,\nto honor the public trust, and to fulfill its responsibility as public servants to its citizens by caring\nfor its most in need.\nWhat should have been a simple cooperative endeavor to improve the lives of the\nresidents of D.C. Village, the Defendants turned into an adversarial contest fraught with\nrecalcitrance, denials and defiance of Court Orders, which brought on formal contempt citations\nand findings of continuing contempt.  The District repeatedly proffered unconscionable excuses\nto defend their indefensible, self-serving operations that should have been an embarrassment and\ndisgrace to any government.  For let it not be forgotten, it was the Defendants who required a\nCourt Order to \"ensure immediately that water, and cups for water, are present...in each\nresidents' room... ensure that individuals with decubitus ulcers are not left to sit or lie in their\nown soiled linens...ensure that adequate supplies of soap are available for the residents\" (Court\nOrder, December 22,1995).\nHow profoundly appalling it is that the Defendants required Court Orders to provide the\nmost basic of human needs, yet, how profoundly vital all the Court Orders were in protecting the\nresidents civil rights, health, safety, and welfare.  This Report is a tribute to the professionalism\nand humanity of one United States District Court Judge, The Honorable Thomas F. Hogan.\nAt this time the Monitor can finally assure the Court that the outplacement of the\nresidents of D.C. Village \"has been satisfactorily and successfully completed\" complying with\nthe Court Order of November 7, 1995, and that their \"individualized needs\" are being met and\nthat the outplacement sites are \"appropriate and adequate\" complying with the Court Orders of\nDecember 22,1995, and February 23,1996.\n\nThe beauty of this case is that  it was so profoundly helpful to so many individuals in\nsuch a short period of time. The best way to grasp the depth and impact of the Court's service to\nthe District of Columbia's most vulnerable, in firmed, and poor, is to review the sampling of\nindividual case summaries placed throughout this Report, starting here with Mr. C.F.\nCase. Summary: Mr. C.F.\nFor years Mr. C.F. lived at D. C. Village with an underlying longing to be on the\noutside. Mr. C.F. is in his fifties, yet.living at D.C. Village beyond his need for  it, he learned\ninstitutional dependency and no one took the initiative to get him out. As President of the\nResidents'  Council, Mr. C.F. unselfishly advocated for others (those institutionalized at D.C.\nVillage and in other long term care facilities)  but not for himself.\nMr. C.F. now lives in the community in an independent/supported living\napartment in the District on the first floor, which is handicapped accessible.\n\"Ifeel  wonderful living on my own...I feel great, \" says Mr. C.F. with his eyes\nsparkling and a constant smile on his face.  Mr. C.F. has his own room and shares a large,\ncomfortable kitchen and handicapped accessible bathroom with three other neighbors.  A\nresident case manager and building manager are on-sitefull  time including weekends. Mr. C.F.\nis provided with a home aide four hours a day five days a week who helps him prepare meals\n(which is difficult for Mr. C.F. because he has limited use of his hands) and assists him when\nneeded with personal hygiene.  On Fridays the aide prepares meals for Mr. C.F. to put into the\nmicrowave for his weekend dining.  Once he has adapted to living independently in this\nsupported environment, Mr. C.F. plans to move to a larger apartment. Mr. C.F. has a computer\nin his room which he uses in his active participation  in nursing home reform advocacy\norganizations in the community.  In fact,  he serves on the board of directors of some of these\norganizations, and has for years, and volunteers at one of them a few days a week. He travels on\npublic transportation and assumes appropriate responsibility for his medical attention.  Mr. C.F.\nis also considering plans to form a residents' council in his building. Mr. C.F. has family  in the\narea and numerous friends  in the District.\nMr. C.F. no longer wears the sad, pained, burdened, and weighted expression of\n\none who is trying to heal the pain of others while carrying around his own. Mr. C.F. exudes a\nvitality and joy of life and a sense of hope for his own possibilities for the first time since I have\nmet him.\nOVERVIEW\nThe struggle to protect the constitutional and legal rights of the residents of D.C. Village\nbegan on May 19,1995, when Mr. Richard J. Farano of the United States Department of Justice,\nCivil Rights Division entered the United States Court House on Constitution Avenue in\nWashington, D.C. and filed the United States' Complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) against the District of Columbia, alleging that the civil\nrights of the residents of D.C. Village had been and continued to be violated.  The Honorable\nThomas F. Hogan, United States District Court Judge for the District of Columbia was assigned\nto the case. A month later on June 19,1995, the United States filed a Motion for a Preliminary\nInjunction to Enjoin Dangerous and Life-Threatening Practices and to Ensure Basic Care,\nServices and Treatment at the nursing home.  These pleadings profiled appalling abuses of the\nD.C. Village residents.  After the United States filed its motion for a preliminary injunction, the\nLong Term Care Ombudsman intervened in this case.  This office had for many years identified\nneglect, abuse, and poor care at D.C. Village.\nIn addition to naming the District of Columbia as a Defendant, the other named\nDefendants in this case are the Mayor of the District, Marion Barry; the then Director of the\nDepartment of Human Services, Vernon Hawkins; the Administrator of the Mental\nRetardation/Developmental Disabilities Administration, Frances Bowie; and the then Executive\nDirector of D.C. Village.\nOn July 5, 1995, moments before the hearing was to take place on the United States'\nmotion for the preliminary injunction, the Defendants agreed to consent decree language that\nmirrored the proposed remedial order in the United States' pleading.  On July 6, 1995, Judge\n\nHogan signed and filed the parties' Stipulated Order which enumerated specific remedial\nmeasures to redress the alleged deficiencies in the nursing home. By signing this document, the\nDefendants agreed to comply fully with the Court Order.  This July 6,1995, Court Order also\nprovided for the appointment of a Monitor to oversee the District of Columbia's compliance with\nthe Court Order, and according to District of Columbia Code, Section 32-1420, advise the\nDefendants on how to comply with federal and District law and regulations.\nOn August 1,1995, Dr. Harriet A. Fields, this writer, was appointed Court Monitor by\nJudge Hogan.  Two week later, and before the Monitor could begin on-site inspection, the Mayor\nand City Council of the District of Columbia unexpectedly and callously announced the closure\nof D.C. Village.  Instead of choosing to improve care for the residents in need, the Defendants'\nseemingly reactive remedy was to close the facility under the guise of fiscal responsibility.  This\nunilateral decision was made with no consultation with the Court or the parties to this case, and\nmost especially with no consultation with the residents of D.C. Village. The Defendants'\ndecision was made without the most rudimentary understanding of, or regard to, the\nconsequences of their actions, namely the debilitation and often premature death associated with\nthe trauma of transfer of elderly and frail individuals.  Soon after entering the facility, the\nMonitor reluctantly discovered and subsequently reported to the Court, that the Defendants had\nno competent governmental oversight nor management ability within D.C. Village to carry out\nthe abrupt decision to close D.C. Village and to appropriately and humanely outplace the\nresidents.  As a result the Plaintiffs successfully moved the Court to augment the responsibilities\nof the Monitor to oversee the transfer and outplacement process (Court Order of November 7,\n1995, Modifying the Stipulated Order of July 6, 1995).\nAs Court Monitor, I first entered D.C. Village in August of 1995 and found that every\nallegation filed against the Defendants in the United States' Complaint and the United States'\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction, including the Residents' Declarations of June 1995, and\nevery violation of the residents' rights that the July 6th Stipulated Order required be remedied,\nstill boldly existed.\n\nThere was a top to bottom systems breakdown of the Defendants operation of D.C.\nVillage.  There was no institutional focus on resident care.  There was institutional neglect and,\nas identified in the Monitor's October 16,1995, Status fteporr to the Court, neglect over a period\nof time is abuse. Furthermore, there was no identifiable competence in the governmental\noversight, administrative and support structure.  What existed was a bumbling, self-serving\nbureaucracy in violation of the first Court Order of July 6, 1995, and in the months that followed,\nin violation of the Court Orders of November 7,1995, December 22,1995, and February 23,\n1996.  Group-think predominated and suppressed individual initiative in well-intentioned\nindividuals time and time again — a bureaucracy so ethically blinded it led potentially competent\nstaff into inertia and dysfunction.\nInternal Systems Breakdown\nThe initial assessments of the Monitor and the nursing home systems expert consultants,\noriginally profiled in the October 16,1995, Status Report, identified among other deplorable\nconditions: residents with no affect or emotion; residents who had lost their spirit; residents\npassively accepting their own neglect, not knowing after so many years that poor level of care\nwas not the norm; residents who rarely or ever smiled; residents with bewildered and even\npained expressions; human beings dying from decubitus ulcers with holes in their bodies so deep\nthat bone was exposed and tissue oozing out of the wound; an over-utilization of easy-to-use\ngastric tubes for feeding residents through the stomach, replacing the human contact of staff,\nwhich would require time and effort to help and encourage the residents to be nourished by\nmouth; no soap for simple hygiene in many of the units and residents' rooms highlighting an\ninadequate infection control program; pervasive use of physical restraints (residents literally tied\ndown); failure to ensure that vendors be timely paid often resulting in interruption or termination\nof critical services, supplies, and medications; overmedication with psychotropic drugs\n(chemical restraints); vital nutritious food and drink not always available; food that was so\nunappetizing it robbed the residents of their desire to eat; residents who no longer needed nursing\n6\n\nhome care and should have been discharged to the community years ago still languishing at D.C.\nVillage; residents in bed all day when they should not have been; residents who could not move,\nwere not turned in their beds; residents lying in their own urine and feces; dirty halls, rooms,\nequipment, and furniture, all reeking with the odor of urine; under-functioning, disorganized\ndepartments with no interdisciplinary cooperation; no supervision of direct care staff; no nursing\nleadership; policies and procedures that were twenty years old, if they exited at all; care plans\nthat were years out of date, if they existed at all; an astonishing lack of knowledge by the medical\nstaff of minimum standards of nursing home practice; desperate need for education and training\nof all caregivers in the minimum standards of care as reflected in federal law and regulations and\nthe Court Orders.\nTo protect the residents health, safety, welfare, and rights, the Monitor  was compelled to\nimmediately advise the Defendants on the need to initiate institutional systems reform, which\nincluded: a care planning system in order to track compliance with Court Orders and federal law\nand regulations; training staff on how to use this care planning system; strongly encouraging an\ninterdisciplinary approach to care; encouraging the assignments of contract nurse staff to the\nsame units for continuity of care; training clinical nurse coordinators in appropriate supervisory\ntechniques; educating staff on how to care for residents without restraints in accordance with\nfederal law and regulations; introducing weight log books on each unit and training the staff in\nhow to track life-threatening weight gain or loss in compliance with federal law and regulations;\neducating staff on how to develop an essential bowel and bladder training program for\nincontinent residents; incorporating rehabilitation concepts into direct care and daily bedside\npractice, such as range of motion exercises, and a regimen for turning the residents which\nincluded reminders broadcast every two hours over the public address system; and more.  It was\nvery humbling and gratifying when on one of the last tours of the units the Monitor made in June\n1996, a staff nurse hugged me and said, \"we are now giving the type of care the residents\ndeserve.\"\nSummary: Mr. J.B.\nOn a Sunday evening in late September 1995, the Monitor and the nursing home\n\nsystems expert consultant found Mr. J.B. in his bed, lying in urine, unturned, totally contracted,\nwith a gapping hole in his body to the bone, and with a distinct odor of dead skin.  This was a\nblatant violation of the Court Order of July 6, 1995 — a full two and a half months after its\nissuance — which stipulated among other very basic care practices, that \"Nursing staff shall\ntake all appropriate steps to care for  and clean those residents who need nursing attention due to\ntheir incontinence. Nursing staff shall take special care to clean and treat ulcerated areas that\nmay have become soiled due to incontinence. \"  Unbelievably, D.C. Village staff seemed unaware\nthat Mr. J.B. 's condition and treatment were not normal for a nursing home resident.  We\nimmediately brought Mr. J.B. 's condition to the attention of the D. C. Village direct care-givers\nso that appropriate steps could be taken.\nConstant and vigilant monitoring reversed Mr. J.B. 's suffering.  Mr. J.B. 's\ninterdisciplinary care plan was developed at his bedside with his involvement and he was\nprovided with counseling and consultations regarding his eventual transfer to another facility.\nFor the remaining four months of his life, never again was Mr. J.B. not turned; never again did\nhe lie in \"soiled\" bed clothing and linens; never again did the odor of death emanate from his\nbed; and Mr. J.B. 's condition, as witnessed on the evening of September 24, 1995, never again\nreturned.\nMr. J.B. 's condition was so preventable, and his suffering so quickly reversed, it\nmade conditions at D. C. Village even more senseless.  That D. C. Village allowed Mr. J. B. 's\ncondition to exist, not only violated the Court Order and federal law and regulations, but it was\nalso a gross violation of Mr. J.B. 's civil rights.  Mr. J.B. 's case is descriptive of how the\nDefendants'  violation of all the Court Orders harmed one individual's life and how the Court's\npresence and intervention helped improve not only Mr. J.B. 's life, but the lives of all the\nresidents while they still lived at D.C. Village. (Mr. J.B was profiled in the October 16, and\nNovember 30, 1995, Status Reports to the Court.)\nExternal Systems Breakdown\nTwo major examples of the entire systems failure are the District's procurement process\nand vendor payment system, which for decades has had a life-threatening, and in many instances\n\nlife-ending, impact on the District's most defenseless.\nThe first individual Defendant listed in this case, the Mayor of the District of Columbia,\njust recently identified the procurement process as the District's biggest problem.  This\nannouncement came nearly one year after the Monitor first identified the problem in this case.\nThe day before Thanksgiving in 1995, D.C. Village was about to run out of vegetables, bread,\nfish, and butter (see November 30,1995, Status Report, pages 29-30). The lack of basic food\nstuff available for the residents was directly related to the failure of the District's Department of\nHuman Services Procurement Office to process the request for purchase orders, a completely\npreventable problem.  Immediately, the Monitor advised the Defendants on what to do to ensure\nthat purchase orders were received, vendors contacted, and supplies delivered.  The presence of\nthe Court was able to rectify this intolerable situation expeditiously so that the residents would\nnot suffer.  Egregious procurement problems continued in other areas at D.C. Village.  However,\nafter reporting these problems to the Court and after appropriate legal motions were filed, these\nwere also rectified.  The Court Order of December 22, 1995, directed the Defendants to \"ensure\nimmediately that the District of Columbia procurement office responds immediately to urgent\nrequests for health care and other supplies to ensure that the health care needs of the D.C. Village\nresidents are appropriately met.\"  It took the Defendant, the Mayor, decades to admit to what the\nCourt in this case recognized, reported, and rectified in a matter of weeks.\nThe second example of the District's systems failure was its chronic inability to timely\npay critical vendors and to execute necessary contracts with these vendors. This was especially\nimportant at D.C. Village where the District purposely relied heavily upon contract nurses and\nother important vendors to provide critical services, supplies, and food to the residents.  The\nMonitor's continuing submissions to the Court profiled the failure of the District to timely pay its\nvendors which resulted in the constant threat of interruption and sometimes actual termination of\nvital services and supplies.  Instead of taking responsibility and immediately correcting this\nsituation for the welfare of the residents, the Defendants through their Corporation Counsel,\nfostered delay and actually misrepresented to the Court reasons why they failed to pay vendors,\nfor example, scapegoating the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management\n\nAssistance Authority (D.C. Financial Control Board) by claiming they had not yet approved\ncontracts, when in fact contracts had been approved months earlier. These misrepresentations\noccurred on such a continuous basis, that the Court felt compelled to refer the Corporation\nCounsel to the grievance committee of the Court on May 17,1996, and found it necessary to\nthreaten the top Administrators of the Department of Human Services with contempt and jail if\nthey did not begin to tell the truth.  Meanwhile, the second named individual Defendant in this\ncase, the then Administrator of the Department of Human Services, Vernon Hawkins, was ousted\nfrom his position by the Mayor on orders of the D.C. Financial Control Board for gross\nincompetence, particularly in the areas of procurement, vendor contracts, and vendor payments.\nIt appears that at least in part, this Defendant's removal was precisely for the deficiencies\nprofiled throughout this case (see Monitor's April 25,1996, letter to the Court in Appendix C).\nIndeed, as early as December 1995, the then Acting Corporation Counsel said that the Monitor\nhad uncovered the major weaknesses of the District government, namely the procurement\nprocess and the vendor payment system.\nCase Summary: Mr. L.R.\nWhile sitting at a bus stop on his way to work several years ago, a bullet in the\nback rendered Mr. L.R.. totally dependent on others for his care. Not only a victim of crime\nwhile able-bodied, he was also a victim of numerous indignities suffered at D. C. Village which\nwere violations of his rights.  Mr. L.R.,an able-minded man in his thirties was profiled in the\nDecember 1995 letters to the Court as the resident who was \"imprisoned in his bed\" because his\nwheelchair was broken and the District had failed  to pay his wheelchair vendor.\nDue to his medical condition, Mr. L.R. required a catheter, but the ones supplied\nto him by D.C. Village were chronically the incorrect size causing an overflow of urine. This\nwas in violation of the Court Order of July 6, 1995, that their be \"an adequate and appropriate\nquantity of medical supplies and equipment...that meet the individual needs of the D.C. Village\nresidents.\"\nOn a Friday afternoon, months after the July 6th Court Order, Mr. L.R. was\nappropriately concerned about his care over the weekend.  In an attempt to advocate for himself,\nMr. L.R. approached the then Director of Nursing who sat down with Mr. L.R. and  calmly\n10\n\nexplained to him why it would take several weeks for him to receive the proper size catheter.\nWhile she calmly defended the inhumane and unconscionably prolonged purchase order\nprocedures of the Department of Human Services for  the District, before her sat Mr. L.R. in his\nwheelchair, with urine seeping down his leg and stained to his pants.  The Monitor observed this\ninteraction and strongly advised the Defendants that they immediately obtain the correct\nsupplies for Mr. L.R.  From that day on, never again did Mr. L.R. not receive the supplies\nrequired for his health, welfare, and the protection  of his rights, and through the Court's\nintervention (see Court Order of December 22, 1995, at V.,C.) the procurement system improved\nfor all the residents benefit.\nToday, Mr. L.R. is President of the Residents'  Council in his new home. He has\nnot encountered medical supply shortages in his new home. He has become more active and\nwrites poetry which the staff are trying to help him publish.  He has a friend at the nursing\nfacility, a young man in a wheelchair.  The activities director is exploring vocational\nrehabilitation for him and ways for Mr. L.R. to work and still maintain his health coverage.  Mr.\nL.R. has plans to complete his general education degree (G.E.D.) and then to become an\ninspirational speaker for youth.  It is Mr. L.R. who is truly inspirational.\nAnother example of the failure of the external government oversight was the illegal\ndepositing of the residents' meager monies, known as the Personal Needs Allowance (PNA), into\nthe D.C. Treasury.  These are relatively small sums of money which must be deposited monthly\ninto the residents' individual bank accounts.  Instead of doing this — which is required by\nfederal law and regulations — the District illegally retained the funds.  This act amounted to theft\nof the residents' funds for the District's own benefit, thus, robbing the residents, the poorest\npeople in the District of Columbia, of their money and the interest due to them (see December 6\nand 10, 1995, letters to the Court, Appendix C). Finally, over a year after this was first reported\nto the Court and after much prompting, the Defendants have agreed to obtain an independent\nauditor's accounting of the residents' funds and interest due. This report should be released\nshortly.\nAdded to the above examples of systems failure was the sudden and ill-conceived\n11\n\nannouncement of the closing of D.C. Village by the Mayor and City Council.\nOUTPLACEMENT\nFrom the time the Monitor first entered D.C. Village it was obvious that the Defendants,\nincluding the D.C. Village administrators and staff, did not possess the requisite knowledge,\nbackground, or experience and were incapable themselves to responsibly, legally, and ethically\ndischarge the residents, especially those with special needs. Indeed, the head of the D.C. Village\nDepartment of Social Services who was designated to \"coordinate\" the outplacement did not\neven professionally or personally know the residents, even though she had been employed at\nD.C. Village for approximately 25 years.  In addition, there was a danger that the already\ncompromised health of the residents would further suffer while the facility's resources were\nbeing diverted away from basic care, required, deserved and demanded by the Court and federal\nlaw and regulations, towards the premature and frenetic discharge activities (some of which had\nalready begun).  This was of grave concern given the years of neglect the residents had already\nsuffered as profiled above and in my submissions to the Court (see Appendix c).\nIndeed, a D.C. Village staff member in the Social Services Department confided in me\nthat the outplacement of the residents was already \"chaotic.\" For example, individual discharge\nfolders were sparse at best and did not present a clear picture of the residents; there were no\ninterdisciplinary care plans for the residents; outplacement was disorganized and beyond the\nability of the Social Services Department; residents were not being informed of their impending\ntransfer, most did know where they were going, nor were they given choices as to their new\nhome contrary to federal law and regulations; staff were not talking to the residents; residents\nwere confused, bewildered, and lost; no resident received any type of counseling to decrease the\nanxiety and trauma of relocation.\nMy first submission of September 5,1995, alerted the Court to the inevitable detrimental\nimpact of uprooting frail and institutionalized individuals — even from abusive situations —\nwhen this decision is made without their control.  The Court Order of November 7, 1995,\n12\n\nModifying the Stipulated Order of July 6, augmented the responsibilities of the Monitor to\noversee the transfer and outplacement of the residents \"including the residents' rights to an\nopportunity for participation in their discharge process.\"\nThe Monitor was compelled to take a proactive stand to immediately advise the\nDefendants to develop and implement humane outplacement procedures to decrease the needless\nsuffering and, in some instances, premature death of the individuals entrusted to the care of the\nDefendants.  These procedures (originally identified as assessments, recommendations, and\naction steps in the November 30, 1995, Status Report to the Court many of which were\ntranslated into the Court Order of December 22, 1995) included the following:  expanding the\nD.C. Village outplacement team beyond the social services department to include the nursing,\ndietary, and therapeutic recreation departments, and when appropriate, the physical therapy and\noccupational therapy departments; developing an interdisciplinary team care plan which included\na counseling program for minimizing transfer trauma; developing an educational program for all\nemployees to sensitize them to the trauma the residents confronted so that everyone from\ndepartment heads to the housekeeping crew would know how to caringly converse with the\nresidents 24 hours a day seven days a week; collecting data on residents' concerns by the unit\nclinical nurse coordinators which were used as the basis for weekly counseling sessions with\nresidents which took place on each unit under the guidance of nursing and social services, with\nstaff, residents, and the President of the Residents' Council present; developing a detailed\noutplacement discharge packet for each and every resident profiling individual residents' unique\nneeds; ensuring that the staff got to know the residents in a meaningful way so that important\ninformation about them was communicated in the Interdisciplinary Team Care Plan, included in\nthe outplacement discharge packets, and shared with the staff in the residents' new homes so that\nthe new staff would really  know the residents and be able to provide them with individualized\ncare; expanding the weekly outplacement meetings to include representatives from all the\ndepartments; introducing soothing music broadcast throughout the facility as requested by the\nResidents' Council.\nFinally, the residents and/or their guardians had an opportunity to visit at least two\n13\nTIT\n\noutplacement sites, had a right to refuse proposed sites, and ultimately chose their own their own\noutplacement site.\nThe outplacement of the residents, a few of whom are profiled below, bears witness to the\njourney of the residents of  D.C. Village from dying to hope.\nf  Summary:  Ms. M.L.\nMs. M.L., profiled in the November 30, 1995, Status Report, was among the\nproud, elegant, old women \"warehoused\"  at D.C. Village who spent most every day all day in\nbed, not turned, incontinent, unable to walk due to contractures, and whose body and spirit were\nwithering away.  Ms. M.L. was a dancer in her youth.  At her bedside was a photograph of her\non stage at the Moulin Rouge in Paris in 1917. How profoundly sad for a dancer in her youth to\nbe at the end of her life unable to move her legs, and it was so preventable.\nAt an outplacement meeting, the Monitor learned from Ms. M.L. 's guardian that Ms.\nM.L. had a rare book collection and \"loved to be read to. \"  This was exactly the type of\nessential, individualized information, unique for  each resident that helps prevent the trauma of\ntransfer when moving to a new environment.  (In fact,  through the Monitor's insistence and\nthrough the Court Orders, such individualized, helpful information was included in each and\nevery resident's outplacement discharge packet.)  Before her death at 96 years of age, Ms. M.L.\nwas out of bed, dressed, sitting up, being read to, and listening to music.  Thus, with no extra\nexpense save for a slight bit of compassion, this former  dancer was finally given quality of life,\nquality of care, and a dignified death.\nDue to her advanced age, 96 years, and frail condition, Ms. M.L. was outplaced\nto Hadley Hospital Skilled Nursing Facility where over thirty other frail D.C. Village residents\nhave been outplaced.  (Hadley recently received three years accreditation from the Joint\nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  The accreditors told the facility  that\nthey have seen only one nursing home with \"sicker\" residents.  Since it is a skilled nursing\nfacility,  Hadley received the sickest individuals from D.C. Village, some of whom have since\ndied, but they did so with dignity.  My April 3, 1996, letter to the Court on page two profiles the\nresidents outplaced to this facility.)\n14\n\nIn the January 17, 1996, Status Report, the Monitor was forced to recommend new\nmanagement, when it became unequivocally clear that the present D.C. Village administrators\nand staff were incapable in every way of carrying out the Court Orders and of properly\noutplacing the residents. For months and months, Defendants fought needed change, fought with\nthe Court, fought with the Monitor, and were counseled on more than one occasion not to meet\nwith, or even speak to, the Monitor.  This posture did nothing but delay needed reforms and in\neffect harmed the residents of D.C. Village.  Indeed, the February 1,1996, letter to the Court\nrequested a halt to outplacement until the Specialty Consult Teams for residents with mental\nretardation and for residents with mental illness was put in place, and the interdisciplinary team\nmet and developed an outplacement summary and plan for each resident that addressed the\nresidents' individualized needs.  (See more'detailed description of Specialty Consult Teams\nbelow.)  In addition, there was no planning for the residents who no longer needed nursing home\ncare and who had been institutionalized years longer than necessary. After appropriate legal\nintervention, the Court Order of February 23, 1996, suspended outplacement until the Monitor\nand Ombudsperson, Ms. Sarodel Childs, were satisfied that each and every resident had an\n\"adequate and appropriate interdisciplinary assessment and individual discharge plan,\" and that\neach and every outplacement met the requirements of the Court Orders and federal law and\nregulations.  The Ombudsperson and the Monitor participated in all outplacement meetings,\nincluding the weekly outplacement meetings.\nAfter much prompting, the Defendants removed the head of the Department of Social\nServices, and from outside D.C. Village but from within the District of Columbia government,\nthe Defendants eventually assigned four competent women to become the new outplacement\nmanagement team who would implement Court Orders and the Court Monitor's outplacement\nrecommendations.  The professionalism of these women has been profiled in the Monitor's\nletters to the Court of February 21, April 3, April 25, May 9, June 6, and June 16, 1996.  Finally,\na competent team approach to outplacement began to take place.\nCase. Summary: Ms. L.E.\nMs. L.E., who is 92 years old had not walked at D. C. Village for years, had little\n15\n\nappetite, was poorly nourished, and had been placed on numerous psychotropic medications.\nToday, in her new home,  Ms. L.E. has learned to not only transfer herself from\nher wheelchair to a walker (an assistive device), but and has learned to walk with the walker.\nShe has regained her appetite and has gained 10 pounds, and her psychotropic medications have\nbeen reduced.  When asked what do you think made the difference in Ms.L.E. 's improvement, the\ncharge nurse responded, \"knowing what s right for  the resident, giving them individualized\nattention, knowing they could do it. \" Ms. L.E. never received this kind of individualized\nattention atD.C.  Village.\nMs. L.E. lives at the Stoddard Baptist Nursing Home where eight D. C. Village\nresidents live.\nSummary: Mr. W.S.\nWhile at D.C. Village, Mr. W.S., an elderly man, for years had a gastric tube\nplaced in his stomach for feeding  and was isolated and rarely spoke.\nToday, in his new home, Mr. W.S. no longer has a gastric tube and enjoys his\nappetizing three meals a day by mouth.  He is provided with individualized attention and he is\ninvolved in activities and talks with attentive staff and other residents.\nMr. W.S. lives at the Washington Center for Aging Services, where five D.C.\nVillage residents live.\nCase. Summary: Mr. B.A.\nWhen Mr. B.A. left D. C. Village nearly everyone cried. For he was more than\nfrail,  he was a skeleton and one of the few  remaining residents with large decubitus ulcers eating\naway at him. I truly thought he would expire within a few weeks. Mr. B.A. was always in bed,\ncontracted, gaunt, with no appetite.\nToday, Mr. B.A. has gained twenty pounds, has a full appetite, and his decubitus\nulcers have healed. I have seen him out of bed, sitting in a chair, dressed in street clothes.  Mr.\nB.A. looks decades younger, he looks alive for  the first time since I met him.\nMr. B.A. lives at the St. Thomas More Nursing Center just across the District line\nin Hyattsville, Maryland, where over seventy-five D. C. Village residents live.\n16\nTUT  1  H  \" IT M  1  •  Ml  II\n\nOnly a handful of residents required outplacement beyond the area, in further reaches of\nMaryland, all are thriving.\nResidents with Mf Ptal Tilness\nIn addition to the above outplacement procedures, there were special procedures required\nfor the residents with a label of mental illness.  The majority of residents with mental illness had\nbeen inappropriately transferred from St. Elizabeth's Hospital to D.C. Village in 1991. A\npsychiatrist was transferred with these residents and there was in place a monitoring program for\nthe mental illness community in the District.  Despite these \"safeguards,\" when the Court\ncommenced  monitoring in August of 1995, the majority of the residents were not receiving any\ntype of psychiatric care nor counseling except for an inappropriate and an overabundant use of\npsychotropic drugs.  Also, the psychiatrist lacked sufficient knowledge of the federal law and\nregulations pertaining to the appropriate use of psychotropic medications.  Clearly, the\nmonitoring program for the' mental illness community in the District failed these residents with\nmental illness at D.C. Village for years, as evidenced by the lack of needed attention given them.\nFor these residents, the Ombudsperson participated in the majority of their\ninterdisciplinary outplacement planning meetings.  Furthermore, the Monitor and the mental\nhealth expert consultant reviewed all the outplacement discharge packets developed from these\ninterdisciplinary care planning meetings.  The Monitor then ensured that the expert advice of the\nmental health consultant was incorporated into these outplacement discharge packets.\nTo humanely outplace this population of residents, the Monitor recommended a Specialty\nConsult Team, which would consist of a psychiatrist, psychologist, geriatric psychiatric nurse,\nsocial worker, and when appropriate, a recreation specialist.  After the United States and the\nPlaintiff-Intervenor filed appropriate legal papers, the Court by its Order of December 22, 1995,\nordered that the Specialty Consult Team be created.  While the residents were still at D.C.\nVillage, the Specialty Consult Team provided counseling for the residents to minimize transfer\ntrauma and not just for those with a label of mental illness, but for any resident needing it;\n17\n\nconducted assessments of the residents which were included in the outplacement discharge\npackets, and utilized by staff in the receiving facilities to provide care in order to meet the\nresidents' individual needs; reviewed psychotropic medications and made recommendations for\nneeded adjustments to the medical doctors (which sadly were often ignored while the residents\nwere still at D.C. Village); and served as consultants on care issues to meet the residents needs.\nToday, the Specialty Consult Team continues to provide individual follow-up counseling\nto residents in their new homes as needed, and serves as consultants to the staff on care issues.\nCase Summary: Mr.  CM.\nMr. CM.  is a large man in his forties  and a Vietnam Veteran. While at D. C\nVillage he most always sat in the day room on his unit in a wheelchair in the same corner\nagainst the wall, slumped over, staring, disheveled, clothes not clean, food often spilled on him,\nwith no affect or expression on his face.  He would periodically erupt in loud outbursts which\nwere frightening  to others. I never saw staff  interact with him, I never heard Mr. CM. speak,\nnor did I ever see him out of his wheelchair, no matter what time of day.\nMr. CM.  was admitted to his new home frightened and still over-medicated on\npsychotropic drugs, contributing to his restless and verbally disruptive and abusive behavioral\nsymptoms, which in turn were frightening to the new staff and residents.  Upon admission, his\nmedications were immediately evaluated and greatly reduced.\nToday Mr. CM.  is a new person.  I have visited him a number of times now since\nhis outplacement.  On all visits Mr. CM.  is smiling and happy.  When I first visited him, I told\nMr. CM.  that I never saw him smile at D.C. Village, his response to me was that, \"Ismile all the\ntime now, once they took me off the drugs...I am finally happy; I haven 't been my fun self for\nyears...I am having fun. \"\nMr. CM. takes daily walks with the staff and is always neatly dressed. In fact, the\nstaff have given  Mr. CM. a neck tie, white shirt, and sweater, which he wears regularly and\nwith obvious pride.  On one visit with the attorneys for  the United States (the Plaintiffs) and the\nCorporation Counsel for the Defendants, Mr. CM.  had a basket of fresh fruit in front of him\nwhich he offered to us. Mr. CM. never had been given fresh fruit at D. C. Village.\n18\n\"BT\n\nMr. CM. no longer lives with a deadened spirit, he now has a joy of life.\nMr. CM. lives at Capitol Hill Nursing Center where over twenty D. C. Village\nresidents live.  (Capitol Hill Nursing Center was profiled in the Monitor's June 16, 1996, letter\nto the Court for  its community commitment and concern for the last remaining residents ofD. C.\nVillage, see Appendix C.)\nGenerally the staff at the residents' new homes have said that once the over-medication of\npsychotropic drugs was decreased and the residents were weaned from them, they found as one\nstaff member said, \"a whole new individual.\"\nCase Summary: Ms. L.S.\nMs. L.S., a beautiful woman, wheelchair bound, who spent most all day everyday\nat D. C. Village roaming the halls shouting profanity loudly and profusely.  She was disheveled,\ngaunt, unkempt, hair not combed sticking out wildly, and there was little attention to personal\ngrooming (as was the case with most all the residents).  While at D. C. Village, I never heard Ms.\nL.S. speak in sentences nor say intelligible words except for profanity.  Occasionally during\nweekdays, Ms. L.S. would seek refuge in the offices of the staff who cared for the residents with\nmental retardation, who had befriended her.  (These were not D. C. Village staff, but outside\ncontractors.)  It was touchingly obvious that Ms. L.S. was starved for adult contact and\nattention.  Ms. L.S. was a music and dance teacher in a local university before her stroke.\nToday Ms. L.S. is groomed, her hair neatly combed, her nails polished, she smiles\nfrequently  and her natural beauty shines through.  Ms. L.S. no longer roams the halls shouting\nand now often speaks in intelligible sentences.  Ms. L.S. receives individualized attention from\nstaff, and in particular from a social worker.  Further, she is involved in individualized music\nactivities therapy, which is directly related to her past life when she was able-bodied.\nMs. L.S. lives in Carroll Manor Nursing Home in the District, where over twenty\nD. C. Village residents now live. A new facility,  this nursing home looks just like that — a home.\nIt is fully  carpeted, the common room or day room is furnished  like a living room, with inviting\nsofas and chairs, plants and a huge television screen.  The dining area looks like a nice\nrestaurant with flowers on the table, place mats, and tableware, and coffee and tea available all\n19\n\nday. Residents rooms have warm-colored -wood furniture  and are made to seem as personable\nand individualized as possible.  There is a swimming pool in the building with a wheelchair lift,\nand the nearby physical therapy area is outfitted with the most up-to-date therapeutic equipment.\nI believe this warm, soothing environment helps contribute to the calming effect\nthis home has had on Ms. L.S. and the other residents.\nC^  Summary: Mr. E.J.\nAlthough needing therapeutic structure to his day, Mr. E.J. was not provided this\nat D. C. Village. For example, most days Mr. E.J. would sit in the canteen area or be\n\"penalized\" for not returning to his unit. As a result the D. C. Village staff often left him in his\nroom by himself. Unlike the other residents with mental illness at D. C. Village who had\noverriding medical conditions requiring nursing home outplacement, Mr. E.J. was fully\nfunctioning and had no medical need to be in a nursing home.\nToday Mr. E.J. lives in the community in a group home for residents with a label\nof mental illness.  \"It's lovely here, I couldn 't ask for  anything better,\" he says.  Mr. E.J's. home\nis in a wonderful large old house on a well cared for and manicured block in the District.  His\nlandlady maintains an inviting, warm, clean, comfortable home and prepares fresh food and\nproduce daily, something neither Mr. E.J. nor any of the other residents had at D. C. Village.\nThere is a peaceful, cozy backyard with a relaxing sitting area.  (When visiting Mr. E.J,  he took\ngreat pride in showing his visitors his living space, which was neat, clean, and decorated with\nsome of his own mementoes.)  It is obvious that Mr. E.J. cares for and responsibly tends to his\nliving space in his home in the community.  Mr. E.J. has an attentive family nearby and his son\ncomes to visit him often.\nEvery day during the week Mr. E.J. attends a day program in the community for\nresidents with mental illness.  Attendance at his day program provides Mr. E.J. with the daily\nstructure, supervision and activities appropriate for him.  This type of structure and activities\nwere never provided for Mr. E.J. at D. C. Village.  When asked how he likes his day program he\nsays, \"I like the concern they have for  us, you can tell by how we are treated they really care and\nrespect us.\"\n20\n\nCnxp. Summary: Ms. G.M.\nMs. G.M., a woman in her forties, young for a nursing home resident, and\nambulatory, received dialysis treatment two days a week  While at D.C. Village, Ms. G.M. was\nchild-like and would wander the halls aimlessly.  She had no responsibility to assume, and no\nprogram to assist her to develop skills to become responsible and independent.\nToday, Ms. G.M. is a new person.  She is an adult. Ms. G.M. still attends dialysis\ntreatment but now with another resident, a young woman who has a double amputation of her\nlegs. Ms. G.M. has taken on the responsibility of \"looking after\" this resident. Ms. G.M. is\ngiven individualized attention by the social services and activities staff and is assuming\nappropriate responsibility for herself. Ms. G.M. is enrolled in a job training program, and\nreturns to her nursing home at the end of each day. Ms. G.M. is currently awaiting placement to\na day program which would therapeutically ease her into community living.  The Director of\nResident Services in her new nursing home is planning, with Ms. GM.for  her to eventually live\nin a group home in the community — a much more appropriate setting for her.  This transition is\npossible for her now that Ms. G.M. is receiving the type of attention, programming,\nresponsibilities, and adult respect that was lacking at D.C. Village.\nMs. G.M. is currently living at IB.  Johnson Nursing Center in the District, where\nover 20 D. C. Village residents now live.\nCasp. Summary: Ms. S.B.\nMs. S.B., a young woman in her forties,  wheelchair bound, and since her early\n2O's without the use of her arms and legs, is completely dependent on others for  her care.  Ms.\nS.B. merely existed at D. C. Village for  over 15 years.  Even though Ms. S.B. has a keen sense of\nhumor, I rarely saw her smile and her affect was most always pained. She was given a label of\n\"trouble-maker\" by D.C. Village staff and administration, as well as by administrators in other\nnursing homes in the District, simply because she could and would articulate deficiencies,\nneglect, and abuses in her care and in the care of others.  What was particularly touching about\nMs. S.B. was that she seemed to possess a selfless, altruistic concern, and rare sensitivity for the\nrights and plight of other defenseless  individuals.\n21\n\nWhile at D.C. Village, the staff subjected her to verbal taunts and threats, lack of\nbasic care and numerous other indignities.  For example, staff and administrators failed to give\nMs. S.B. any type of care to encourage her growth and development. Not until her last few\nmonths at D.C. Village did Ms. S.B. move into a private room, which she had requested for\nyears.  Ms. S.B. had lived in a room with three other very elderly and sick residents.  Whenever a\nresident room became available, Ms. S.B. was told over and over again that the room would be\nused for a staff office, despite the fact  that there were already offices and a nurses' station on\nevery unit. Ms. S.B. found herself in a situation ofpowerlessness.  Ms. S.B. had owned a\ntelephone, her only lifeline to the outside world, yet for years at D.C. Village, it remained in\nstorage, because no one took the initiative to install it for her.\nDuring her very first week in her new home, Ms. S.B. s telephone was installed,\nsuch a simple task, such a simple act of human kindness.\nStaff and administration at Ms. S.B. 's new home have stated that they were\n\"appalled at the medications she came with. \"  There have been several interdisciplinary team\ncare planning meetings with representatives from  all departments (one of which the Monitor and\nconsultant attended) to coordinate her care and establish the most appropriate medications for\nher.\nToday, Ms. S.B. reports that she is \"not used to being so happy...not used to\nsmiling so much...not used to people being so nice. \" She adds, \"I don't have to worry about\nviolation of rights and stealing and crude snide comments, \" as Ms. S.B. so often received  from\nnurse aides at D. C. Village. Ms. S.B. 's assessment of the difference in her care is that, \"nurse\naides are supervised and doing what they are supposed to do. \"\nMs. S.B. has been given a new label from the staff, \"refreshing. \"  One staff\nmember commented, \"I always look forward  to caring for her. \" Another nurse aide has told Ms.\nS.B.,  \"you always make my day, it's not often I have a resident with a sense of humor. \"\nMs. S.B. has plans to obtain her general education degree (G.E.D.).  The\nDirector of the Social Services Department is planning  with Ms. S.B. for her to join a networking\nclub for  other young wheelchair bound individuals in the District.  Further, the social worker\nhas started a younger adults club at Ms. S.B. 's new home.  Ms. S.B. adds, \"they do things here\nfor you they never did at D.C. Village. \"\n22\n\nMs. S.B. lives at Stoddard Baptist Nursing Home.  The new Administrator is Ms. Alberta\nBrasfield, who admitted Ms. S.B. when there was no other site identified in the District for her.\nThis Administrator was also the new Executive Director of D.C. Village when this case was\nfiled, and thus, became the fourth listed Defendant in this case. In a new, positive environment\nwith a Board of Directors' philosophy of resident-centered care, both are thriving.\nResidents with Mental Retardation\nAs was the case for residents with mental illness, special additional steps were required\nfor the residents with mental retardation prior to their outplacement and after to ensure continuity\nof care.\nMany of the residents with mental retardation were inappropriately transferred to D.C.\nVillage in 1991, when Forest Haven, the last District-run institution for those with mental\nretardation, was closed under the Evans v. Barry, ei_al. case. These residents were literally\ndumped into D.C. Village, which was not capable of handling their unique needs.  Therefore,\nGeorgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC) received a subcontract to provide\ntheir expertise in habilitation and care for these individuals.  GUCDC provided services to the\nD.C. Village residents with mental retardation Monday through Friday for the most part during\nthe day and occasionally on a Saturday.  However, during the evenings and nights and on most\nweekends these residents did not receive the appropriate habilitation care and attention necessary\nfor them.  The administrator of the District's Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities\nAdministration is the third named Defendant in this case.\nIn the July 6, 1995, Stipulated Order, the United States insisted, and the Defendants\nagreed to discharge all of the individuals with mental retardation, and to place them into\nappropriate community settings that met their individualized needs, by October 31, 1995.\nWhen monitoring first commenced, however, it quickly became clear that the Defendants\nwere incapable of complying with the Court Order of July 6, 1995, to appropriately outplace this\n23\n\npopulation by October 31,1995, and to ensure that these residents individualized needs would be\nmet.  In fact, the Defendants missed this deadline and subsequent express deadlines and\ncontinued to violate the Court Orders until the last resident with mental retardation was finally\noutplaced on June 13,1996.\nThis Monitor's assessments, which were originally profiled in the October and November\n1995 Status Reports, identified the following initial problems with the process that had been put\nin place: the case manager from MRDDA — who knew the residents the least — was\nresponsible for identifying the outplacement site; outplacement sites identified were resistant to\naccepting the residents because of the District's failure to pay for past services and continuing\ndisputes with the District over interim rates; outplacement sites identified by the Defendant were\noften not appropriate for the residents physical needs (for example, a number of wheelchair\nbound residents were identified for outplacement to the second and third floors of a building that\nhad no elevator and or sprinkler system); three of the residents had medical conditions beyond\nthe capabilities of the staff at group homes to care for them; there was no plan for staff training\non how to care for these unique individuals in the residents' new homes; and once residents with\nmental retardation were to be discharged, there was going to be no assessment of the adequacy of\nthe care they were receiving to meet their ongoing needs.  GUCDC reported that some residents\nwith mental retardation were outplaced prematurely and without their knowledge, even though\nGUCDC knew the residents better than anyone else, including (MRDDA), who had been\nentrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the outplacements.  This was another example of\nthe Defendants failure to collaborate with appropriate and knowledgeable professionals for the\nbest interests of the residents.  This was simply unacceptable.  Obviously, MRDDA had failed its\nresponsibilities.  Indeed, the November 30, 1995, Status Report, and my subsequent submissions\nto the Court indicated how every outplacement site identified by the Defendant had proven to be\ninappropriate and had \"fallen through.\"\nTo humanely and appropriately outplace this special population, the Monitor\nrecommended that an additional Specialty Consult Team be created which would consist of\nprofessionals with particular expertise in developmental disabilities and mental retardation,\n24\n\nincluding a nutritionist, psychologist, speech pathologist, and recreation specialist.  In\nconjunction with this recommendation in the November 30,1995, Status Report, the United\nStates and the Plaintiff-Intervenor filed appropriate motions, and after a hearing, the Court issued\nthe Order of December 22, 1995. Through the constant insistence of the Ombudsperson and the\nMonitor, MRDDA finally expanded and extended the contract for GUCDC to include off-site\nduties, and they became the Specialty Consult Team.  This Specialty Consult Team provided on-\nsite training of staff in the residents' new homes; demonstrated specific and unique care-giving\ntechniques, for example how to feed, turn, and position medically compromised individuals with\nmental retardation; directly facilitated the residents adjustment in their new homes so that their\nindividual needs were met; accompanied the residents on the day of their outplacement and, in\nsome instances, stayed with them for several days; conducted inservice education programs for\nall staff, from activities to housekeeping, at the Health Care Institute where three medically\nfragile residents were outplaced; served as consultants to the staff in the community-based Day\nPrograms where two residents attend; and more.  The Specialty Consult Team remained in place\nuntil competency was demonstrated by the new caregivers.\nIt is for the non-payment of this Specialty Consult Team vendor, GUCDC, which\nrendered the Defendants their last continuing contempt citation on July 15, 1996.  In fact,\nGUCDC had not been paid in full for their services at D.C. Village since 1991. Once this\nbecame known and reported to the Court in June 1996 (see Monitor's June 16 and June 28,1996,\nletters to the Court in Appendix C), and after the United States and the Plaintiff-Intervenor filed\nlegal papers, payment to this vendor was completed by the end of July 1996. In addition, the\ngroup home providers in this case, who had not been paid in full for years, have currently been\npaid to date.\nThe Court Order for a Specialty Consult Team has provided continuity of care, quality of\nlife and protection of the residents' rights.\nThe Monitor and consultant expert in mental retardation have visited all the residents\nwith mental retardation from D.C. Village in their new homes.  All of the residents are receiving\n25\n\ncontinuity of care and are in the most appropriate setting to meet their individual and unique\nneeds.  These residents have been profiled in nearly every submission to the Court (see Appendix\nC).\nCase. Summaries: Ms. A.R. and Mr. K.F.\nMs. A.R. and Mr. K.F. live on Bunker Hill Road, N.E., in a group home for\nindividuals with mental retardation operated by Wholistic Habilitative Services.  Five\nindividuals with mental retardation live in this home.  (In fact two other residents are also\nformer D. C. Village residents, Ms. D.L. and Ms. P.A.  They had moved to this home prior to my\ninvolvement in the outplacement.)  The house is in a quiet neighborhood, on a block with nicely\nmanicured lawns.  Their house is very much a home, comfortable and warm, beautifully\ndecorated with green leather sofas and green leaf patterned drapes.  The residents bedrooms are\npersonalized and decorated with matching bedspreads and drapes and the residents have their\nown space.  The home is bright, cheerful, and clean and has a happy feeling to it.  The curtains\nand blinds are open to let in light and the world outside. And the residents are very much part of\nthe world outside, for not only do they take frequent  walks in their nice neighborhood, but in the\nwell maintained backyard, there is a lovely, inviting, comfortable, and nicely constructed\nwooden deck, which is wheelchair accessible and a sitting area among large old trees. All the\nresidents enjoy this area and use it for  recreation under the supervision of attentive staff  On the\nMonitor's  visits with the mental retardation  expert consultant, the food served to the residents\nwas always nourishing and well-balanced.  The staff provide the residents with attention on a\none-to-one basis. Each resident is given an empowering role with real responsibilities, for\nexample, clearing the table after meals.  Ms. A.R. and Mr. K.F. have been integrated into the life\nof the home.\nThe house manager said the Specialty Consult Team has been \"very, very helpful,\nwe could not have done it without them. \"  The Specialty Consult Team has provided  instruction,\ndemonstration, and consultation to the Wholistic staff on how to properly care for, how to\ninteract with, and how to feed the residents.  The Team has also instructed the new care-givers in\nthe most appropriate activities for the residents to maximize their habilitation potential.\nSince they moved from D.C. Village to the community, both Ms. A.R. and Mr. K.F.\n26\n\nlook brighter, happier, and they are well groomed.\nMs. A.R. is much more engaged in her environment and interactive with others.\nShe responds readily to instructions, and is much more social than she was during her days at D.\nC. Village.  With oversight from an aide, Ms. A.R. takes her own plate from the dinner table to\nthe kitchen.  Ms. A.R. readily follows  instructions, and now drinks from a cup.  Her gait has\nimproved and Ms. A.R. has learned to walk up and down stairs in her new home.\nMr. K.F. has not exhibited aggressive behavior he so often erupted into at D. C.\nVillage. Mr. K.F. interacts with his peers and staff in the home. He has one-on-one attention,\nespecially at meal times, and is learning to eat at the table with others. Mr. K.F. has a sparkle to\nhis eyes which I did not see in him at D. C. Village.\nBoth Ms. A.R. and Mr. K.F. attend off-site day programs Monday through  Friday\nfor at least five hours a day.\nMs. A.R. attends Better Treatment Center in the District.  The staff at Better\nTreatment say that the Specialty Consult Team has been \"very helpful\"especially with Ms.\nA.R.. 's unique dietary needs.  The collaboration among the Specialty Consult Team, Ms. A.R. 's\ngroup home providers, and the day treatment program  staff have effected a smooth transition\nensuring continuity of care in Ms. A.R. 's new life in the community. Ms. A.R. has developed\ninterpersonal relationships with peers and staff and has established a close constructive\nrelationship with one particular staff person.  She is much more responsive and engaged when\nseeing other people.  The day program staff provides Ms. A.R. with respect and utilize proactive\nstrategies to help her develop her full potential.  I have seen Ms. A.R.. grow since her\noutplacement.\nMr. K.F. attends a day program at PSI Services in the District.  The staff report\nthat when Mr. K.F. first arrived, he would run and snatch items from others, especially food.\nMr. K.F. now sits still, eats at a table with a group, and does not grab others food.  Mr. K.F. is\non a bowel and bladder training program (as he is at his group home) and he is brought to the\ntoilet every two hours. Mr. K.F. is now able to indicate to the staff when he needs to use the\nbathroom by patting his stomach and he has learned to wash his hands. Mr. K.F. is involved in\nstructured activities with other day program attendees and has taken a likening to caring for\n27\n\nplants.  A staff member at the day program said, \"we are very proud seeing (Mr. K.F.)\nimprove...he is like a different person, \"and describe him as \"lovable. \" He socializes and has\nadjusted to his surroundings.  It is obvious when visiting Mr. K.F. that staff have great affection\nfor him, as was evident with the staff at Ms. A.R. 's day program.  Care has been coordinated\namong the Specialty Consult Team, the group home providers, and the day program staff to\nensure that Mr. K.F. 's individualized needs will continue to be met.\nGrnup\nSix former D.C. Village residents with mental retardation live at this group home\noperated by D.C. Family Services. This home is in a beautiful neighborhood and the house has\nbeen lovingly remodeled to be handicapped accessible.  In the rear of the house is a nicely\nconstructed wooden ramp which leads into a spacious backyard with an area for barbecues. The\nresidents enjoy their comfortable outdoor space.\nThe residents at this group home are severely physically impaired., nevertheless,\nthey are up and out of bed everyday and neatly dressed in street clothes.  While at D. C. Village\nsome of these residents were rarely out of bed, especially Mr. R. W. and Mr. T.S. who essentially\nhad not been out of bed for years.\nWith trained staff members, the residents are engaged in one-on-one therapeutic\nactivities appropriate for their individual development.  All the residents have progressed\nconsiderably toward attaining their individual potential.  The Specialty Consult Team has been\nparticularly  helpful in establishing nutrition protocols.  Incidentally, the nutritionist formerly\nwith the Specialty Consult Team is now the nutritionist for D.C. Family Services, and the full-\ntime Licensed Practical Nurse at the home worked at D. C. Village and knew the residents when\nthey lived there.\nAt D. C. Village, Mr. T.M. was fed  by an invasive gastric tube through his\nstomach, which he would continually pull out. At his new home in the community, he is slowly\nlearning to feed himself  Mr. T.M. is up and out of bed now, dressed, engaged in his\nenvironment, and he is much more sociable.  Whereas upon his outplacement to this group home\nhe would not allow human contact, he now allows others to touch him.  The 0 Street staff are\nactively working with Mr. T.M. to help him progress to the point he can attend an off-site day\n28\n\nprogram.\nAt his new home in the community, Mr. F.M. is up all day and dressed and he\nwears shoes now which he never did at D. C. Village.\nWhile at D. C. Village, except when she was sleeping in bed, Ms. S.A. remained on\na mat on the floor. Now Ms. S.A. sits up straight in a wheelchair and eats at the dining table.\nShe is on a bowel and bladder training program.  With the input of the Specialty Consult Team,\nthis group home provider along with a day program in the District are now planning to\ntransition Ms. S.A. to off-site day programming.\nSince she has left D. C. Village, Ms. S.P. is on a program to wean her from the\ngastric tube in her stomach, is learning to eat by mouth, and her weight has improved. She can\nnow wipe her mouth when requested to by staff. Ms. S.P. has learned to clap her hands and\nseems much happier now than she was during her days at D. C. Village. As with Ms. S.A. there\nare current plans to transition Ms. S.P. to an off-site day program.\nCnso Summaries:  Ms. C.W., Ms. C.L., and Ms. A.B.\nThese three medically fragile residents with mental retardation now live at Health\nCare Institute (HCI), a skilled nursing facility in the District.  The Specialty Consult Team has\nbeen essential in easing these residents transition to their new homes.  This Specialty Consult\nTeam has conducted regular inservice education programs for all HCI staff from administration\nto housekeeping.  The Activities Department has worked closely with the Specialty Consult Team\nto ensure that these three residents receive habilitation care to meet their individual and unique\nneeds, and in addition, they receive music therapy and one-on-one sensory stimulation.  Along\nwith the other female residents of HCI, Ms. C.W., Ms. C.L., and Ms. A.B. receive \"glamour\ntherapy, \" such as regular manicures and hair styling which improve their quality of life.\nIt is evident when visiting Ms. C. W., Ms. C.L., and Ms. A.B., that they are cared\nfor  with affection and respect by knowledgeable staff. Ms. A.B., who was rarely out of bed at\nD. C. Village, is up out of bed and dressed much more so now than she ever was before. Her\nmedications have been readjusted and she breathes more easily. Ms. C. W. who was always\nconfined to her bed and wheelchair at D. C. Village, is now being taught to crawl, with the\nwatchful expertise of the HCI physical therapists and nursing staff  In addition, Ms. C. W. makes\n29\n\nmuch more frequent eye contact with those about her than she did at D.C. Village.\nCase Summary: Mr. P.L.\nMr. P.L. also medically fragile lives at Catonsville Convalescent Center. The\nSpecialty Consult Team has been instrumental in ensuring Mr. P.L. 's unique needs are\ncontinuing to be met by his new caregivers.  The Team has consulted with the Catonsville\nActivities Department and placed Mr. P.L. into programs appropriate for his habilitation\npotential.  Mr. P.L. has an endearing smile, and when visiting him it is clear that Mr. P.L. is also\ncared for with affection and respect by knowledgeable staff.\nOutplacement nf Residents into the Community\nWhen on-site monitoring commenced in late August 1995, there were some residents\nwho should not have been institutionalized, they should have been outplaced into the community\nyears earlier.  Furthermore,  residents were not appropriately stimulated to reach their \"highest\npracticable physical, mental, and psycho-social well-being\" (1987 federal Nursing Home Reform\nLaw). This lack of stimulation and long term neglect created a pall of powerlessness and inertia,\nwhere sadness reigned, and the residents rarely smiled.  For example, Mr. C.F. remained in an\nenvironment where he did not need to be; Mr. M.W. wanted to get out, but did not know how;\nMs. M.M. felt trapped.\nCase Summary: Mr. C. W.\nFrustrated knowing that he remained inappropriately institutionalized and left\nwith nothing to do, Mr. C. W. would often help staff distribute and collect meal trays. Mr. C. W.\nhas a double amputation of his lower legs, however, he walks well with prostheses, and because\nof his high functioning  was frequently mistaken for staff. Meanwhile, no one at D.C. Village was\nassuming responsibility for his discharge planning, leaving Mr. C.W. wandering with no purpose\nand left to languish in an institution where he did not belong.\n\"It's heaven, I'm free, \" was Mr. C. W. 's response when asked how it feels  living\noutside of D.C. Village.\n30\n\nMr. C. W., 55 years old, lives independently in the community, in a church owned\napartment building which is handicapped accessible.  He does his own shopping, and loves to\ncook his own food.  He participates  in recreational activities sponsored by the management of\nhis apartment building and has already been to Atlantic City and Solomon's Island. He is also\nlinked to a vocational rehabilitation counselor in his neighborhood.  When visiting Mr. C. W. it is\nclearly obvious that he is well liked by the full  time management staff of his building and his\nneighbors.\nHe travels by public  transportation  and daily takes long walks in his nice\nneighborhood in the District.  Mr. C. W. no longer takes the many medications that were\nprescribed for him at D.C. Village, and he states that living independently \"makes you feel\nbetter. \" Mr. C. W. has become baptized in the church next to his apartment building.  Mr. C. W.\nhas a sparkle, lightness, and happiness to him which was never present at D. C. Village. During\nthe visit with Mr. C. W. in his new home he did not stop smiling and laughing which became\ncontagious.  One cannot help but be extremely happy for him and all the residents in their new\nhomes.\nMr. C. W. was profiled  in the Monitor's May 9, 1996, letter to the Court,\ndescribing the Defendants intention to outplace Mr. C. W. with no arrangement for  medical\nfollow-up.  The presence of the Court was able to rectify this insensitivity when it surfaced at an\noutplacement meeting.  Today, Mr. C. W. receives consistent and regular medical follow-up  at a\nmedical center in his neighborhood.\ntP Summary: Mr. M. W\n\"I am very much better....I was so glad to get out. \"\nMr. M. W., an innocent gunshot victim, used to sit for hours at a time in the day\nroom at D. C. Village working on puzzles and waiting  \"to get out, \" now he likes being out of\nD.C. Village a \"whole lot better. \"\nMr. M. W. has an amputation of his leg and for the majority of time is in a\nwheelchair.  Mr. M. W. lives in a public housing building in the District for senior citizens in a\nhandicap accessible apartment.  The bathroom is wheelchair accessible with appropriate safety\nfeatures.  His apartment is furnished  comfortably.  Mr. M. W. likes to cook and eat what he likes.\n31\n\nNonetheless, he knows what is good for him and follows  a diet recommended for his circulatory\ncondition.  He has family and friends in the District who are his support system and shop for\nhim.\n>: Ms. M.M.\nMs. M.M., a woman in her forties,  became institutionalized several years ago\nwhen she was unable to walk. After learning to walk again, however, Ms. M.M. remained\nunnecessarily institutionalized for years.  While at D.C. Village, Ms. M.M.  usedtowalk\nrestlessly through the halls looking for activities to engage in and stimulate her and always\ntalked longingly about \"getting out on her own, \" and yet little to no planning was done on her\nbehalf. Mr. M.M. is hard of hearing and had wanted to learn sign language for a number of\nyears.  On a visit to Ms. M.M. in her new home with attorneys for the United States and for the\nDefendants, Ms. M.M. reported to us that while living at D.C. Village whenever she had\nexpressed a desire to learn sign language, she was mocked and ridiculed by staff.\nToday, Ms. M.M. lives in an apartment on her own in the community and is taking\nresponsibility for her new independence.  Ms. M.M. is actively engaged in vocational\nrehabilitation training and is looking forward  to working again. She regularly takes herself to\nher medical appointments for her rehabilitation therapy.  Ms. M.M. has joined a church and has\nbecome an active participant in its activities and has begun to learn sign language. Ms. M.M. S\napartment is customized for a hard of hearing person with a voice volume device on her\ntelephone and a light in various areas of her apartment which activates when someone rings her\ndoorbell.  Ms. M.M. likes her apartment and where she lives.\nMs. M.M. walks around the corner to the nearby supermarket with a shopping\ncart and loves to do her own cooking.  Ms. M.M. comfortably and easily travels on public\ntransportation to her appointments and community activities, and visits former D. C. Village\nresidents outplaced to other homes.  It is really quite thrilling to see people who were, in effect,\nimprisoned become free.\nAll the residents outplaced into the community have food stamps to help meet their\nnutritional needs, a vocational rehabilitation counselor and training, appropriate medical\n32\n\nattention, Medicaid coverage, subsidized rent, metro access cards for easier transportation, and\nsupplemental security income.  The former D.C. Village residents who live in apartment\nbuildings have caring and attentive staff and their apartments are furnished comfortably with\nitems supplied by D.C. Village. For those requiring it, the apartments are tailored to the\ndisability and handicap needs of the individual residents.  Touchingly, many of the residents\nmaintain regular contact and \"check up\" on each other by telephone. It is obvious upon visiting\nthe residents, how much they appreciate the great gift of their new found independence and\nfreedom.\nThe last resident of D.C. Village was humanely outplaced on June 24, 1996.\nMonitoring gf tho Outplacement Sites\n\"Our Warmest Welcome...We're Happy You're Here With Us and We Know You'll\nfind many new Friends Here...\"  This is a sign that greets the residents in one new home, it\nsums up the reception all of the D.C. Village residents have received in all of their new homes.\nMonitoring at the outplacement sites has consisted of meeting with the administration,\ndepartment heads, and direct care staff, reviewing residents' charts and plans of care, touring the\nentire facility, and visiting at traditional and non-traditional times, such as, evening and\nweekends.  Furthermore, I shared and left copies of the Court Orders with the administration in\nevery nursing home visited, and reviewed the residents history at D.C. Village with staff and\nadministration.  Many of the outplacement visits to the residents were made with the Monitor's\nexpert consultants in nursing home systems, mental health, and mental retardation. Any care\nissues or questions that arose were able to be resolved with the staff, residents, and\nadministration on-site during these visits, or in follow-up, and without requiring the assistance of\nthe Court.  There has been open and ongoing communication with all outplacement sites.\nThe Court Monitor's duty is to evaluate and determine that the residents individualized\nneeds are being met and that the outplacement sites continue to be appropriate and adequate, and\n33\n-irr\n\nthen to report to the Court that the residents \"discharge has been satisfactorily and successfully\ncompleted\" (Court Order of November 7,1995).\nThe Court Monitor has visited each and every resident outplaced from D.C. Village in\ntheir new homes and can assure the Court that the outplacement sites are currently appropriate\nand adequate.  I fully expect that the outplacement sites will continue in their admirable efforts to\nmeet the individualized needs of the residents.\nLESSONS TO BE LEARNED\nIt is instructive to learn how the Court and justice turned an appalling situation around\nand gave the residents quality of care and quality of life.\nI believe this case was so helpful to the victims whose civil rights had been violated\nbecause the professional behavior tenet of a client/society focus was the guiding framework: and\nwas never lost.  There was no vested interest except the swift, tireless, and relentless pursuit of\nthe protection of the residents' civil rights, their quality of care and their quality of life.  The\nsuccessful outcome of this case was due to the particular vigilance of the Court in calling\nfrequent Status Hearings often on a weekly basis; holding the Defendants accountable to the\nCourt Orders, and holding the Defendants and their Counsel responsible for violating them and\ntheir solemn oath to comply; the compassionate oversight of the United States Department of\nJustice; and the constant presence of the Court in the facility.  A professional collaboration\nemerged.  The Court Monitor's  submissions to the Court consisted not only of necessary\nassessments of compliance, but in all instances included recommendations and identified action\nsteps to advise the Defendants on how to comply with the Court Orders and federal law and\nregulations.  These recommendations and action steps in turn were often incorporated into the\nfrequent pleadings of  the Plaintiffs, and the resultant issuance of the Court Orders addressed\nthese concerns when the Defendants refused to act.  This type of proactive professional\ncollaboration is particularly efficient and effective in cases of recalcitrant Defendants and quickly\ndelivers help to the individuals who need the intervention of the Court in the first place — those\n34\n-•r--  •  gww—i  nr\n\nwhose civil rights have been violated.\nA second example of effective collaboration also highlights the bitter sadness of this case\nand the senselessness of the Defendants reactions.  Well over a year after the Complaint was filed\nby the U.S. Department of Justice, and well over a year of denials, of fighting the Monitor, of\nmotions to deny the Monitor's expansion of duties, of advice from counsel not to speak with the\nMonitor, and of a motion to terminate the Monitor before the Court's work was completed (see\nAugust 11,1996, letter to the Court in Appendix C), a constructive professional collaboration\nwas finally put into action:  On September 25, 26, and 27, 1996, both the Plaintiff (represented\nby Mr. Richard J. Farano and Mr. David Deutsch of the U.S. Department of Justice), and the\nDefendant (represented by Ms. Barbara Mann of the Corporation Counsel for the District of\nColumbia) accompanied the Court Monitor on visits to all the residents outplaced to the\ncommunity, all the residents with mental retardation outplaced in the District, and the majority of\nresidents outplaced to nursing homes in the area.  Whenever residents and/or staff identified\nunresolved transition issues, for example lack of payment of contract services or lack of payment\nto group home providers, all three visitors either resolved them on site or follow-up was\npromised in a spirit of cooperation.  Ms. Mann is to be credited for her responsiveness to the\nneeds and problems identified by residents and staff in these visits, and in a follow-up letter to\nthe Court Monitor of October 28, 1996, Ms. Mann listed her interventions in resolving the\nremaining issues, including payment of services, and offered to be of further assistance.  Not to\ndiscredit the import of this process at this time, but it is a shame that it took one year and one\nmonth after the presence of the Court at D.C. Village to effect this intelligent, non-combative,\nnon-litigious team approach.\nThis belated advocacy and teamwork on the part of the Corporation Counsel for the best\ninterests of the residents is what should have existed on day one of this case, instead of the\nconstant denials and misrepresentations in Court.  Indeed, the Plaintiffs representative lamented\nthat the teamwork among all concerned parties is what he expected to happen the day the\nDefendants signed the consent decree agreeing to comply with the stipulations of the first Court\nOrder of July 6, 1995.\n35\ni  •' •\n\nThis process of ieamJKQik by all concerned parties, Plaintiff, Defendants and the Court\nis a mn^tn\"-*™\"\"***1 for resolving Court cases. This kind of professional collaboration should\nbe enforced system wide-to ensure the competence, responsibility and accountability of\ngovernment to right wrongs, and to ensure that government intelligently and swiftly care for its\nmost precious charge and prevent the suffering of its most defenseless.\nAnother valuable lesson to be learned is that defensiveness is harmful to the defenseless,\nand useless and embarrassing for the Defendants and their representatives who signed consent\ndecrees on their behalf.  Counsel is better served by knowing first hand  the needs of the\nindividual's whose civil rights have been violated, and then to advise their clients, the\nDefendants, to provide the individualized interventions required to protect the civil rights of\nhuman beings and to comply with Court Orders.\nThe failure of the Defendants to provide the very basic services to its most needy points\nto the system-wide breakdown, lack of political will to do what is right by its citizens, and a mis-\nfocused bureaucracy  as profiled in this Report and in the Monitor's previous submissions to the\nCourt.  When individuals within a government bureaucracy are blinded to their mission as public\nservants and function solely for their own benefit and aggrandizement, then the neglect, abuse,\nand trampling of the civil rights of the systems most defenseless is the sad consequence.  When\nindividuals within a government bureaucracy have a single client/society focus and function as\npublic servants to benefit their constituents as human beings with rights, then a bureaucracy can\nbe used as a tremendous force for good, as evidenced by the swift success of this case. This type\nof client/society focus must be imposed on individuals within a disfunctioning bureaucracy, as it\nthis case by Court Orders, contempt citations, and threats of imprisonment.\nwasm\nRole\nMonitoring in this case always held dear the charge to advise the Defendants on how to\ncomply with the Court Orders and federal law and regulations, no matter what the price, no\nmatter what the resistance.\n36\n\nMonitors, Special Masters, and Receivers must not be lulled into functioning as if their\npositions should remain in place for years. They should be proactive for the good of those whose\nrights are being violated, in this case the residents of D.C. Village. When the Monitor sees\negregious abuses, then immediate interventions are required by bringing the wrong to the\nattention of the direct caregivers and overseeing its immediate resolution, then notifying\nadministration, and finally identifying the systems failure.  (For example, when this Court\nMonitor first arrived at D.C. Village, initial assessments identified an overabundance of physical\nrestraints and no knowledge of current federal law and regulations pertaining to their use.  Within\na few weeks there were virtually no physical restraints in the facility.  This process came about\nby literally overseeing staff untie residents and educating staff about the federal law and\nregulations.)\nI believe that oftentimes facilities and staff simply do not know how to improve care, and\ntherefore, it is the professional duty of the Monitor to take immediate proactive steps, and when\nnecessary bring in expert consultants, to protect the rights health, safety, and welfare of the\ndefenseless.  This should be followed by recommendations and action steps for system-wide\nimprovement to ensure abuses do not recur.  In the case of obstinate Defendants, it is imperative\nto notify the Court of the need for the Defendants to implement the Court Monitor's\nrecommendations and action steps, and it is vital to frequently communicate with the Court on\nthe Defendants status of compliance with the Court Orders.\nAs the eyes and ears of the Court, with a mandate to be objective and neutral, the Court\nMonitor in no instance should rely solely on the word of the Defendants to monitor compliance\nwith Court Orders or to correct their crimes by their own will. If this were the case these types of\njudicial appointments would not be needed.  This is not to say that Monitors should not work\nwith the Defendants, they should always attempt to, but with open eyes. To highlight this point,\non one of my last nights of touring the units at D.C. Village, a nurse came up to me and told me,\n\"When  you first came here when you were making rounds on all the units, the administration\nwould call the next unit before you got there and warn them and then they would go there and try\n37\n\nto clean things up and try to snow you, but you kept on coming back and now they hate you.\"\nThis addresses another vital lesson to be learned.  Monitoring must occur at traditional\nand non-traditional hours, for example, evenings, nights, and weeksnHs  and should be frequently\nunannounced in order to truly obtain an objective assessment of the lives and care of the\nresidents.\nContinuity of Monitoring\nAnother lesson to be learned is that it is imperative for the welfare of the residents that\nmonitoring not cease at the point of the last resident's outplacement, but must continue until the\nMonitor determines that the outplacement sites are \"appropriate and adequate to meet each\npersons individualized needs.\" Visiting the residents in their new homes and meeting with staff\nhas not only helped ensure that the residents individualized needs are being met, but I believe,\nthese visits have spread an enormous amount of goodwill in the community for the cause of\njustice and the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable, infirmed, and poor among us. In\naddition, I believe the Monitor's position should not be prolonged indefinitely, but continue only\nuntil the Monitor can assure and report to the Court that each and every resident is \"satisfactorily\nand successfully outplaced.\"\nCommunity Involvement\nCultivating expert consultants from the local community of professionals is a valuable\nlesson for other Monitors.  It is an opportunity for professionals to be.involved in community\nservice, spreads goodwill and, I believe, can be a lesson to the Defendants that there is\ncompetence among their midst ready to serve.  This Court Monitor utilized the expertise of\nprofessionals in the District including Howard University's Department of Nutritional Sciences,\nGeorgetown University's School of Nursing, the Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Institute, and George\nMason University's College of Nursing.  Experts from these institutions were consultants to the\nCourt Monitor and not only shared their valuable expertise for the benefit of the residents, but\ndemonstrated a commitment to the District's most vulnerable and poor by wanting to help.\n38\nIT\n\nAdvocates\nAdvocates and advocacy organizations, like the monitoring role, must also be proactive.\nBut they must know their clients well.  Therefore, they must visit their clients at the bedside in\nthe facilities so they can speak with effectiveness, credibility, and authority.  The needs of the\ndefenseless, the weak and vulnerable demand that advocates shun timidity and passivity and\ninteract directly with their clients, otherwise, advocacy organizations exist to maintain their own\nbureaucratic structures.\nFederal and Tnral Surveyors\nWhen Court monitoring ceases, then the protection of the defenseless reverts to the\noriginal government oversight authority, federal and local surveyors. In the instance of D.C.\nVillage, these government surveyors failed the residents year after year, survey after survey, for\nthe terrible conditions that I found at D.C. Village could only exist as a product of years of\nneglect and abuse.  So not only did the Defendants exhibit the internal and external systems\nbreakdown identified earlier in this Report, but the federal and local surveyors also exhibited a\nsystems breakdown by their inability to enforce improved conditions at D.C. Village for years.\nAppallingly, these conditions would have continued even to this day had it not been for the\nUnited States Department of Justice bringing these abuses to the Court's attention under the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIP A).  The Ombudsman Program identified abuses at\nD.C. Village for years.\nCoincidentally, a September 1996 United States General Accounting Office (GAO)\nReport entitled, Medicaid:  Oversight of Institutional Care for the Mentally Retarded Should Re\nStrengthened, recommends that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) develop an\nenhanced monitoring program in facilities and strengthen enforcement mechanisms to remedy\nviolations that are cited in the same institutions year after year in federal and state surveys.\nAlthough this GAO Report addresses deficiencies in the oversight of public facilities for\nindividuals with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities, I can say it also aptly\n39\n\napplies to the failure of effective federal and local government survey oversight, the results of\nwhich I witnessed in my year at a Nursing Home called D.C. Village. The District surveyors\nfailed in part due to the inherent conflict of interest in policing their own. The penalty for citing\nabuses could have resulted in a loss of government funding, therefore the District surveyors\nwould be inclined to overlook or downplay serious violations of rights, as noted in the GAO\nReport.  Although HCFA and local surveyors cited D.C. Village over the years, care did not\nimprove until proactive monitoring was in place with the backing of a courageous and\ncompassionate U.S. District Court Judge.\nFurthermore, I believe the protection of the residents rights would be well served if\nHCFA developed an objective, neutral, and independent enhanced monitoring program with\nstrengthened enforcement mechanisms that would hold not just an institution accountable for\nviolations of civil rights, but individuals criminally responsible if abuses continue — from the\nbedside nurse to elected government officials if necessary.\nThe present enforcement mechanisms of termination of funding to the facility, financial\npenalties to the institution, or halting admissions are not effective as weapons to improve care, as\nI witnessed in my year at D.C. Village.  There must be swift and active correction of wrongs, if\nnot corrected, termination of employment, and if needs be, imprisonment for those responsible\nfor denying individuals their civil rights.\nAn \"enhanced monitoring\" program should include yearly training in effective and\naggressive monitoring, as outlined above under Monitoring Role, and include a review, analysis,\nand evaluation of each monitor's present duties.\nFinally, part of an enhanced monitoring program for federal and local regulators must\ninclude a mechanism to demand an accountability of government funds earmarked for the\ndefenseless, vulnerable and poor.  For example, at D.C. Village there was enormous waste of\nfunds.  The federal government matched the District's handsome reimbursement rate, which was\none of the highest in the country at nearly $240 a day per resident, yet it seems that neither the\n40\n\nfederal government, in this instance HCFA, nor the District's own Medicaid Offices and\nDepartment of Regulatory Affairs ever demanded an accountability for its generous funding.\nThere certainly was no evidence that these millions of dollars ever benefitted the needs of the\nresidents at the bedside.  However,  an overabundance of staff and administrators, for example,\nsix medical doctors (including the Medical Director), eighteen therapeutic recreation staff, five\npharmacists, and nurse aides padded on the night shift, all comported with the District of\nColumbia's arcane, and self-serving Personnel Office policies.\nIt is hoped that, others may learn from this case about how wrongs can be righted through\nthe intervention of justice and the Court, but perhaps more importantly, how to protect the civil\nrights of the defenseless before the situation ever escalates to Court action.\nCONCLUSION\nIn my year at D.C. Village, I saw in the residents' eyes the product of years of neglect and\nabuse. United States of America v. The District of Columbia, si. al., Civ. No. 95-948 (TFH) Re:\nD.C. Village Nursing Home restored dignity and respect to these individuals. As each resident\nwent out the front door to their new homes they did so bravely and with dignity.\nThe 269 residents of D.C. Village would have tragically and needlessly continued to\nsuffer and die, but due to the courage and compassion of one U.S. District Court Judge, The\nHonorable Thomas F. Hogan, the guidance of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Plaintiff-\nIntervenor for the Ombudsman program, and through the constant presence of the Court in the\nlives of the residents, they are now free, their civil rights have been returned to them.  I am now\nconfident that they will have better and happier lives.  For those who did not have the physical\nstamina to withstand the transfer, dignity was restored to them as they faced their final weeks,\ndays and even hours, a dignity at death that would have been denied them without the\nintervention of the Court.\nSummary: Mr.  KB.\n41\n\nOn the day the last residents left D.C. Village, Mr. KB.  sat in his wheelchair,\nwaiting, alone in the day room on his dark and empty unit, with a stoic, sad, and resigned\nexpression on his face.  I sat down with Mr. KB.  and he held out his hand and I held his hand.\nMr. KB.  was among the many residents at D. C. Village who never smiled, sat alone in their\nwheelchairs and left staring into walls, and rarely had human interaction. I told Mr. KB.  that\nhis new nursing home, which he had visited, was on a beautiful river where residents sit outside\nand people go fishing. Mr. KB.  's eyes lit up, and he whispered in a very soft voice, \"I used to\ngo fishing.\"\nI told Mr. KB.  that I would visit him in his new home and he said in a voice\nunaccustomed to attention, \"you will?, really?, thank you. \"\nToday, Mr. KB.  sits on the patio deck by the beautiful river with other residents.\nHe smiles now with a peaceful expression and his eyes sparkle when he says, \"I am very happy\nhere, I love it.\"\nOn behalf of the residents of D.C. Village, thank you Judge Hogan for your courage and\nhonor and thank you to the United States Department of Justice for its compassionate oversight.\nAlso, thank you to Ms. Elma Holder, the founder of the National Citizens' Coalition for\nNursing Home Reform, who is responsible for the federal law and regulations, that with Judge\nHogan's Court Orders so helped me help the residents of D.C. Village.\nTo the residents of D.C. Village Nursing Home, the most dignified and brave among us,\nthank you for the lessons you have taught us all.\n42\n\nAPPENDIX  A\nCHRONOLOGY of MAJOR EVENTS\nUnited States of America v.

No. 95-0948 TFH\nv.\nRLED\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA el al,\nMAY  t 4 J997\nDefendants.\nClerk, U.S. Disinct Court\nDistrict of Columbia\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nPlaintiff Intervenor M. Anne Hart has filed with the Court a motion for contempt\nsanctions, accompanied by proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  After having\nreviewed the plaintiff intervenor's amended proposed findings of fact, the defendants' opposition\nto these proposed findings, and the plaintiffs and plaintiff intervenor's replies, and after having\ncarefully considered the parties' oral arguments with respect to the plaintiff intervenor's\nproposals, the Coua hereby enters the following findings of fact and conclusions of law to\nsupplement its previous ruling holding the defendants in contempt of court.\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nCLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE  DEMONSTRATES THE DISTRICT'S\nCONTEMPT OF COURT DUE TO NONPAYMENT OF VENDORS IN VIOLATION\nOF THE STIPULATED\nORDER.  -\nA. The Court's Previous Findings.\n1.  On December 20, 1995, in its oral findings from the bench in support of\nits finding of contempt, the Court found that the District owed well in excess of $100,000 to\nvendors in arrearages in excess of the 45 day time frame set forth in the July 6 Order and that\nsuch arrearages had continued consistently throughout this Court's involvement in this matter\nwith the result of causing potential shortfalls in essential health care, and food and other needed\nsupplies.  12/20/95 Tr. 5, 11, Exhibit 1 to Intervenor's Motion for Contempt Sanctions\n(\"Intervenor Exhibit\").  These and other findings led the Court to conclude that \"It's without\ndoubt that the District is in violation of the court order.\"  Jd.., Tr. 8.\n2.  The Court's written opinion on December 22, 1995 further held that \"By\nthe defendants' own admission, at least $161,000 in vendor payments are overdue beyond the\n45-day period.  This figure was provided by counsel during the status call on December 20,\n1995, but the defendant's written submissions suggest an even higher indebtedness total of\n$380,323.34.  .  .  .  The nonpayment has caused more than one threatened removal of contract\nnurses and now threatens to deprive the residents of a physical therapist.\" 12/22/95\nMemorandum and Opinion at 2.\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 3/82)\n\nB.  The District's Admissions since December 20. 1995\n3.  On January 18, 1996, the District represented that two full-time\nemployees would spend 100 percent of their time processing invoices and purchase orders and\n\"reduce the time lag for the payment of vendor invoices and to ensure the transmission of\nnecessary documents to the financial management system and ultimately to the chief financial\nofficer, as well as the city administrator for the issuance of a check.\" 1/18/96 Tr. 19-20,\nIntervenor Exhibit 2.  Further, the District represented that, with respect to contracts requiring\napproval by the Finance Control Board, \"Mr. Hawkins has addressed that situation by\nrequesting that a contract officer for DHS set up and, administer all contracts involving DC.\nVillage and to ensure that those contracts reach the financial responsibility of Management\nAssistance Authority Board so that they can be put in place on a permanent basis.\" Id.., Tr. 20-\n21.  In light of these and other developments, the District contended that \"We think that at least\nthe District should have the opportunity to purge itself of the contempt order.\"  Id.., Tr. 22.\n4.  Subsequently, at the April 4, 1996 status conference, the District stated\nthat as of April 2 \"[w]e owe approximately . . . $672,000.  Of that amount, $353,000 is beyond\nthe 45-day requirement.  Of the $353,000, $131,000 is beyond the 45-day requirement.\"  4/4/96\nTr. 18, Intervenor Exhibit 3.  Jeanette Michael confirmed these figures as of April 2 at the April\n29 contempt hearing. 4/29/96 Tr. 23.\n5.  At the April 4, 1996 status conference. Corporation Counsel stated to the\nCourt \"so in a technical sense, we understand that we are not in compliance\" and \"we are not in\nstrict compliance with your order by any means.\" 4/4/96 Tr. 24, Intervenor Exhibit 3.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n6.  According to an exhibit submitted by the District at the April 4, 1996\nstatus conference, the District owed overdue amounts of $14,074 to American Therapeutic,\n$93,662.51 to National Nurses, $51,471.48 to Total Healthcare (a portion of which must be\npaid to the IRS as required by a tax lien), $47,861 to National Patient Care, and $14,917.47 to\nSRT Medical Staff.  Intervenor Exhibit 4.  This submission excluded numerous invoices\nreferenced in the Monitor's Report.\n7.  The District admitted to the Court at the April 26, 1996 contempt hearing\nthat \"we are approximately $78,000 beyond the 45 days.\" 4/26/96 Tr. 11.\n8.  The DHS response to the Monitor's Vendor Payment Report dated April\n28, 1996 (submitted to the Court on April 29, 1996) admitted the following amounts, in addition\nto others, were 45 days past due: $20,882.13 to CUP, $12,652.76 to SRT Premier, $202.84 to\nAbbott Lab, $47,861 to National Patient Care Systems.\n9.  The DHS response to the Monitor's Vendor Payment Report dated April\n28, 1996 also listed numerous invoices that were over 45 days past due from the \"Date Invoices\nSubmitted,\" but not from the \"Dates Invoice Rec'd DHS.\" The differences between these two\ndates in some cases was as much as two months.  It is unclear whether, in all cases, DHS came\ninto physical possession of the invoices only on the day marked as \"Day Invoices Submitted,\"\nand not on some earlier date.\n10.  At the April 29, 1996 contempt hearing, the District admitted to the\nCourt that there is \"approximately $85,000 which is beyond the 45-day time line.\" 4/29/96 Tr.\n4-5.\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n•\"•  irr\nrrr\n\n11.  The District's May 9, 1996 report on vendor payments admitted that\n$69,238.81 in payments remained 45 days past due.  This figure was attested to under oath by\nJeanette Michael and Wayne Casey, respectively the consent decree coordinator and Deputy\nDirector of the Department of-Human Services.\n12.  The District's May 15, 1996 report on vendor payments, also attested to\nunder oath, stated that $60,000.41 in payments remained 45 days past due.  This amount\nincludes overdue invoices discovered after the May 9, 1996 report.\nB. The Monitor's Reports.\n13.  The Monitor reported on April 25, 1996 that the District was in violation\nof the Stipulated Order with respect to overdue amounts, including $47,761 to National Patient\nCare System, $20,882.13 (March 5 invoice) to CUP, and $11,945 to Therapeutic Management\nSystems (February 13 and March 10 invoices).\n14.  The Monitor reported on May 9, 1996 that National Patient Care Systems\ninvoice of $47, 761 remained outstanding.  Monitor 5/9/96 Report at 5.  Payment of this amount\nwas approved by the Court on April 16, 1996.\nII.  CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE  DEMONSTRATES THE DISTRICT'S\nCONTEMPT OF COURT DUE TO MISREPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT\nCONCERNING ITS\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDERS OF THE COURT,\n15.  The Court stated in its December 22, 1995 Order that it would take\nfurther action with respect to its concerns about misrepresentations to the Court if such\nconduct continued.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nA.  Misrepresentations Concerning the Control Board,.\n16.  In its April 24 Opposition to the Motions for Contempt Sanctions, the\nDistrict stated, \"As of April 18, 1996, the contracts for National Nurses and American\nTherapeutics were pending approval at the control board.\"  District Opposition at 3.  After the\nMonitor reported that this was inaccurate on April 25, the District admitted in a filing on April\n29, 1996 that \"this was an inadvertent error.\"\n17.  At the April 29 contempt hearing, counsel to the Finance Control Board,\nDaniel Rezneck, confirmed that the April 18 filing was false and that two contracts for National\nNurses were approved respectively on February 28 and April 2, 1996  and two contracts for\nAmerican Therapeutics on February 21 and March 28, 1996. 4/29/96 Tr. 31-34.\n18.  The misrepresentation stated in the District's April 24 Opposition was\nrepeated throughout April.\na.  The DC. Village payment report dated April 2, 1996, falsely\nstated that several vouchers for National Nurses and American Therapeutics are \"waiting for CB\napproval.\"\nb.  The District falsely represented at the April 4, 1996 status\nconference:  \"In two cases, American Therapeutics, to whom we owe $14,000, and\nNational Nurses, to whom we owe $93,000, we are awaiting Control Board approval on\nthose contracts.\" 4/4/96 Tr.  18-19, Intervenor Exhibit 3.\n19.  In defending its \"inadvertent error\" and arguing it had not engaged in\nmisrepresentations, the District reported in its April 29 submission that \"The contracts referred\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nto in the monitor's April 25, 1996 letter for these two vendors are different from the contracts\nreferred to by defendants.\"  According to the District, this \"different\" contract for National\nNurses was approved not on February 28 but on April 2, 1996 ~ albeit before the April 18,\n1996 filing. The District stated on this basis at the April 29, 1996 status conference:\n[Intervenor's] counsel has, has duplicated the position of the\nmonitor and has identified the incorrect contracts.  We stand by\nour prior executive summaries.  We have not misrepresented to\nthe Court those contracts identified by specific numbers.\n4/29/96 Tr. 68-69.\n20.  The Control Board has confirmed that the National Nurses contract approved on\nApril 2, 1996 covered services for the period January 26, 1996 to February 29, 1996. Letter\nfrom Daniel A. Rezneck, dated May 14, 1996.  The invoices that the District maintained were\npending pursuant to this the contract approved on April 2, 1996, however,  were dated January\n22, 1996 and February 3, 1996.  District Executive Summary, April 2, 1996 at 3.  These\ninvoices thus did not -- as represented by the District ~ concern services for the period of the\ncontract approved on April 2, 1996.  These false representations were made by the District,\nmoreover, in a hearing called by the Court to determine whether the District had made false\nrepresentations.\n21.  The District's April 29, 1996 filing also admitted that the Finance\nControl Board was not responsible for some of the delay in paying vendors and stated\n\"Defendants did not convey and did not intend to convey to anyone, the impression that\nthe FRMAA or control board was responsible for delays in the payment of vendors.\"\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nCounsel to the Finance Control Board also confirmed that no delays have ever been\nattributable to the Control Board.  4/29/96 Tr. 35.\n22.  The District previously represented to the Court on April 4, 1996\nthat the Control Board was responsible for delays and stated that \"there has been a new\nprocess imposed.  We have to now refer additional costs to the Control Board for\napproval, so it appears that some of the delay is the result of the implementation of the\nnew procedure.\" 4/4/96 Tr. 19, Intervenor Exhibit 3. This representation was false.\nB.  Misrepresentations Concerning Vendor Payments.\n23.  The District's April 2, 1996 report on vendor payments concluded that:\n\"The District expects to resolve the problems associated with the late payments by April 18,\n1996.\" Intervenor Exhibit 4.  This did not take place.\n24.  At the status conference on April 4, 1996, the District stated that\n\"we expect those checks to be cut by April 8.\"  Tr. 18, Intervenor Exhibit 3.  On April\n12, 1996, the District again represented by its counsel that the District had mailed\nchecks for overdue invoices. The District never complied with these representations to\nthe Court and the steps it undertook do not indicate it intended compliance.\n25.  In its April 2, 1996 Executive Summary submitted to the Court, the\nrecorded invoice date for Therapeutic Management Services  is March 18 for $12,030.\nBased on the March 18 invoice date, the District represented that the invoice was not\noverdue.\nAO72A\n(Rev. 3/82)\n\n26.  In actuality, two outstanding invoices from TMS were dated\nFebruary 14 and March 11, and totaled $12,030.  Intervenor Exhibit 5 to 4/29/96\nContempt Hearing.  These are two separate invoices, on two separate dates, and neither\nis dated March 18.  Contrary to the report submitted to the Court, both invoices were\noverdue over 45 days on April 2, 1996.\n27.  The District's April 24 Opposition stated that \"Contrary to the\narguments of plaintiff, there was never a threat to the health and safety of residents at\nD.C. Village.  During the week of March 24, 1996, THR [Total Healthcare Resources]\n*\nprovided nurses through March 26, 1996 and assigned one treatment nurse on March 27,\n1996.\" District Opposition at 4.  The District omitted the highly material fact that Total\nHealthcare Resources suspended services of its nursing personnel on March 28, 1996.\nMonitor Report 4/3/96.\nC.  Misrepresentations Pertaining to Personal Needs Allowances (\"PNA\").\n28.  The District told the Court on January 18 that \"With respect to\npatient accounts, as we've indicated, those accounts have been transferred to a private\nbank account, which will make the availability of patient funds quicker.\" 1/18/96 Tr. 16.\nBased on this representation, the Court stated at the January 18 hearing, \"The Court is\nalso pleased to see that the patients' monies have been recognized as their monies and\nhave been put into separate, private accounts and trusts that in the past that all the\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nmonies that came in that were due to these patients have been credited to them as\nappropriate.\" 1/18/96 Tr. 29, Intervenor Exhibit 2.\n29.  The District's representation on January 18 was false.  In actuality,\nall residents' PNA accounts remaining in the D.C. Treasury were not transferred to\nseparate interest-bearing PNA accounts at Independence Federal Savings Bank until\nMarch 18, 1996 and only after the Monitor pursued this issue further. Monitor 4/3/96\nReport at 5.\n30.  Prior to March 18, 1996, the therapeutic recreation staff reported in\nMarch, 1996 that five residents transferred on December 27 did not have their PNA.\nMonitor 4/3/96 Report at 7.  At this time, the PNAs were being \"Drawn down from the\nD.C. Treasury\" and that \"some monies are not totally transferred.\" Monitor 4/3/96\nReport at 7.\n31.  Prior to the transfer of these monies to a private savings account,\nthe District admitted that each resident's PNA was maintained in the District treasury\nand had to be obtained by requisition, leading to delays in payment.  The Court was\nadvised that each PNA \"is accounted for separately, but all the District cash is kept in a\npool cash arrangement, so that in order for [residents] to have access to this money,\nD.C. Village must requisition cash from our central treasury.\" 12/12/95 Tr. 20.  \"I\nbelieve the monies are accounted for separately, but now, when you need to get the\ncash, then that's a process that goes through the chief financial officer in order to get the\n10\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\ncash released.\" Id.  \"Ms. Fountain confirms what I was saying to you.  And that,\nevidently, there has been some holdup there,... the paperwork has to arrive in the chief\nfinancial officer's office so he can approve it for the cash to be released, to be sent out\nto D.C. Village so that people can walk up to the window and get money.\" Id.\nD.  Misrepresentations Concerning the Outplacement of Residents with\nMental Retardation.\n32.  The District considered outplacing certain residents with mental\nretardation to D.C. Family Services.  The District told the Court on February 2, 1996\nthat with respect to D.C. Family Services,  \"We have an agreement on a tentative rate.\"\n2/2/96 Tr. 8.\n33.  There was no agreed upon rate for the services of D.C. Family\nService on February 2.  Monitor 4/3/96 Report at 3 & Monitor 4/25/96 Report at 4.  The\nDistrict subsequently admitted on March 22 that \"a proposed interim rate is anticipated\nin the near future.\" 3/22/96 Biweekly status report.\nE.  Misrepresentations Relating to Notices to the Ombudsman of Discharges.\n34.  In many cases, the District has failed to provide the Long Term\nCare Ombudsman notices of the transfers and discharges from D.C. Village since the\nannouncement of its closure.  Exhibit 1 to Intervenor 12/11/95 Memorandum.  At the\nstatus conference on December 4, 1995, the Court inquired to counsel for the District of\nColumbia about the notice issue.  Counsel for the District of Columbia responded that\n11\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nnotice to the Long Term Care Ombudsman is not required by law where another person\nis designated as the resident representative.  12/4/95 Tr.  18-19, Exhibit 3 to Intervenor\n12/11/95 Memo.\n35.  The statement of counsel to the District of Columbia at the status\nhearing is contrary to the law of the District as is confirmed by the prior filings of the\nCorporation Counsel's office in other cases.  District of Columbia law provides that,\neven where the Ombudsman is not the resident representative, a nursing facility must in\nall cases provide a notice of transfer and discharge to the Long-Term Care Ombudsman.\nD.C. Code § 32-1432(e).  Further, the Corporation Counsel's Office has previously\nconfirmed its knowledge of this statutory requirement in other cases.  Exhibit 3 to\nIntervenor  12/11/95 Memorandum, Exhibit 3 to Intervenor  12/11/95 Memorandum.\n36.  After concerns were raised about notices and care plans for hospitalized\nD.C. Village residents at the status conference on December 4, 1995, Corporation Counsel\nstated that \"our policy is not to refuse the return of any patient who is sent to the hospital\nbecause of the need for acute medical care.  We don't discharge patients to the hospital.\"\n12/4/95 Tr. 32, Exhibit 3 to Intervenor 12/11/95 Memorandum.\n37.  That same month, two D.C. Village residents were discharged to new\nfacilities from hospitals, one on December 1 ~ three days before the status conference — and one\non December 15 — ten days after the status conference.  The District's Response to the\nInquiries of the Court dated January 30, 1996 at 1, 24.  Both residents were discharged without\n12\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\nTir\n\nnotice being provided to the Ombudsman or preparation of care plans and assessments required\nby law. Id.; Monitor 1/17/96 Report at 14.\n38.  At the January 18, 1996 status conference, Corporation Counsel, in\nresponse to questions from the Court, stated that notice was given to the Ombudsman of the ten\ndischarged residents since December, 1995.  1/18/96 Tr. 27-28, Intervenor Exhibit 2.\n39.  On January 29, 1996, the District notified residents that a federal\nregulation \"requires\" DC. Village to \"discharge\" residents from the facility after a resident has\nbeen hospitalized for the 18 day period known as the \"bed hold\" period.  Exhibit 1 to\nIntervenor's 2/1/96 Memo.  The District informed residents that \"If you are in a hospital when\nyour bed hold period expires, the social services department of the hospital will assist you in\nobtaining services in another nursing facility.\"  M-  In January, five hospitalized residents of\nD.C. Village were as a result characterized in D.C. Village records as \"Patients who are\ndischarged from the census but remain in the hospital.\"  Exhibit 4 to Intervenor 2/1/96 Memo.\n40.  On January 30, 1996, the District told the Court that two of the ten\nrecently discharged residents had in fact been discharged without statutorily required notices\nbeing provided to the Ombudsman because they \"were discharged directly from hospitals after\nbeing hospitalized and away from DCV more than eighteen days.\" District Response at 1 &\nExhibit Y.  Corporation Counsel admitted at the February 2 status conference that \"The District\nwas not initially involved in that decision\" to discharge. 2/2/96 Tr. 8.\n41.  By notice dated February 5, 1996, the District rescinded its illegal January\n29 directive and represented to the Court that the policy was issued by •\"mistake.\"  Affidavit of\nAlberta Brasfield, dated February 7, 1996.\n13\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n42.  On January 30, 1996, D.C. Village issued four notices of discharge\nof individuals falsely stating that \"Ms. Sarodel Childs [of the Ombudsman's  office]\nagreed\" to the transfer.  Childs Dec, dated February 1, 1996. In each case, Ms. Childs\nand the Ombudsman's Office had not agreed to and was not asked to agree to the\nproposed transfer. Id-\n14\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n1.  Since the Court's first finding of Contempt on December 20, 1995, the District has\nrepeatedly been in contempt of the Section C of the Stipulated Order requiring defendants to\npay in full all outstanding debts to individuals and vendors who have supplied goods and/or\nprovided services to or on behalf of DC V residents and thereafter to provide prompt payments\nin fvill to such individuals and vendors for goods supplied and/or services rendered not later than\nforth-five days from the date a legitimate invoice is received by the defendants.\n2.  The District has been in violation of Court orders as detailed in the Court's order of\nFebruary 23, 1996.\n3.  The District has made misrepresentations to the Court with respect to its compliance\nwith Court orders and other matters.\nMay\nThomas F.

Within  the\nlast  three months alone, DCV lists  \"multiple decubitus ulcers\" as\nas^.yiv^^\n\na cause of death for two residents.  Unless immediate action is\ntaken, many 2CV residents are in imminent danger of infection,\npotential less of limb, sepsis, and even death.\nIn addition, other critical areas of basic care a: DCV are\nalso dangerously inadequate.  Bed-ridden residents are left :c\nsit in their own urine and faces for hours.  Adequate amounts of\nnutritious food and drink are not always available.

Given the size of\nthe leg sores and the potential for infection, it was\ndecided that the best course of act ion would be to have  both\nhis legs amputated.  This was done at the hospital.

Through CRIPA, Congress authorized\nthe Attorney General to bring suit to secure those rights. In\ndoing so, Congress stated \"the Attorney General's authority\nextends to initiating suit 'for or in the name of the United\nStates,' in order to represent the national interest in securing\nconstitutionally adequate care for institutionalized citizens.\"\nK.R.

There is an especially strong public interest in\nprotecting a population like the DCV population at issue here\nwhich is dependent upon the District for vital and basic care,\ncaptive in an institution, and desperately in need of halo from\nthe Court.  Hence, the issuance of the requested preliminary\ninjunction would further the national/public interest inherent in\nprotecting their rights.  See Soaye v. Milliken, 497 F. Sucp.\n2 54  2 6 2 (W.I. Mich. 1930)  (uoholdina the constitutional ri~hts\nof institutionalized persons \"serves not only their personal\ninterests, but the interests of the society in which they live\").\nThe long-standing and clear public interest in protecting\nthe constitutional and legal rights of its citizens along with\nthe greater need to protect those who cannot help themselves,\nof dem.onstrating that a preliminary injunction satisfies the\npublic interest.\nIV.  NECESSARY REMEDY\nBased on all of the foregoing, immediate injunctive relief\nis necessary to prevent substantial and serious harm to DC\"\nresidents.  The United States has drafted a proposed order\nset tine: forth the required remedies in order to enj oin the\nDefendants from dangerous practices and to provide appropriate\ncare and treatment in the following areas:  (1) care of dscubitus\nulcers;  (2) care of incontinent residents; (3) nursing staff and\npractices;  (4) medication administration;  (5) food and drink;\n- 41 -\n\n{6) medicacicr.s, medical supplies, and equipment;  (7) personal\ncare items; and  (S) services and alternative placements for\npeople with mental retardation.  In addition, the United 3cat.es\nseeks an order requiring Defendants to pay in full all\noutstanding debts to individuals and vendors who have supplied\ngoods and/cr provided services to or or. behalf of DCV residents\nand to provide prompt payments to them in the future.  Mcrecver,\nviolations, the United States seeks the right co conduct\nunannounced visits of DCV as well as the appointment of a Mcnito:\nto oversee Defendants' compliance with the preliminary\ninjunction.  Finally, the United States seeks protection fr:~\nretaliation for any individuals who provide information cn\nconditions at DCV Village.\nV.  CONCLUSION\nThe evidence in support of the United States' Motion for\nPreliminary Injunction demonstrates a sufficient basis for\ngranting a preliminary injunction to prevent continuing harm, and\nthe threat of irreparable injury.  For ail the foregoing reasons\nthe United States respectfully requests that the Court enter an\norder for a preliminary injunction pursuant to the attached\nproposed order to remedy the dangerous and life-threatening\nconditions and practices at DCV that violate residents'\nconstitutional rights.  •;\n- 42 -\nHT\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nERIC K.

Anderson, B.S.N., M.A., J.D., the United Stages'\nnursing consultant in this case, pursuant to the provisions of\n28 U.S.C. § 1746 and D.D.C. R. 106(h), do hereby declare:\n1.  I am a registered nurse with twenty-three years cf\nexperience in the health care field.  My experience and\nbackground encompass serving as a nurse clinician, a clinical and\nstaff nurse, to serving as the deputy director for the State of\n•Maryland's Department of Health and Hygiene, Mental Hygiene\nAdministration.  In that capacity I was responsible for the\nprogrammatic management of over 110 community-based programs and\nthe fourteen facilities administered by the Mental Hygiene\nAdministration.  More recently, I served as the senior\nadministrator responsible for the direction and operation of the\nUniversity cf Maryland, School of Medicine, Departments of\nAnesthesiology and Psychiatry.  I have also served as a faculty\n\n- 2 -\nassociate c: \"he University of Maryland, School of Medicine.\nMost recently, 1 have served as a consultant evaluating nursing\nand health care and working with state and local governments and\nprivate corporations regarding health care delivery systems for\ntnousancis cz patients.\n2.  7c acquaint the Court with my specific qualifications,\nI provide a copy of my curriculum vitae, which is attached :c my\nDeclaration, which contains further details about my experience\nand quaiincaiions .\n3.  I have served as an expert consultant in cases\ninvolving professional nursing standards for long-term care.  I\nhave worked with the United States Department of Justice since\n19SS in the Department's investigation and enforcement activities\nunder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\n(\"CRIPA\").  In this capacity, I have been involved with CRI?A\ninvestigations in several states including New York, Maine,\nVirginia, Massachusetts, California and the one CRIPA\ninvestigation in the District of Columbia.\nINVOLVEMENT WITH THIS CASE AND FAMILIARITY WITH D.C. VILLAGE\nNURSING HOME\n4.  In April 1S94, I was asked by the Department of Justice\nto serve as an expert consultant to assess the care and treatment\nof residents at the D.C. Village Nursing Home in Washington,\nD.C.  I first toured D.C. Village on June 6-7, 1994.  Prior to\nthe tour, I reviewed numerous documents provided by D.C. Village,\nincluding policies and procedures of the facility, internal\n\n- 3 -\nreports and summaries, consultations and treatment protocols,\nstaffing p?.::arr.s and sign-in sheets, incident reporcs and\nhospitalizazicr. records.  During the investigative tour, I\nobserved, arr.cr.g other things, routine nursing and health care,\nroutine management, training and treatment of residents on zheir\nliving units, as well as meal times on the living uni~s.  In\naddition, I reviewed numerous records, including medical re::rds,\nInterdisciplinary Team (\"IDT\") notes, nurse progress notes and\nassessments, physician notes, and hospitalization records.  I\nalso interviewed residents and multiple staff members.  In\naddition, I observed the care and treatment of decubitus ulcers.\n5.  My review of the care and treatment of D.C. Village\nvaci na^\" c ~ *~ * oci rev^a^ed a number of c^it^cal d°^~ic*'rir''~'''~~\nThe nursing care and related treatment provided to the residents\nwas significantly below accepted professional standards.  Cf rr.osr\nimmediate concern was the facility's failure to provide each\nresident with adequate and appropriate nutritional management in\naccordance with accepted standards of care.\n6.  In addition, I found inadequate nursing care and\ntreatment for the care, prevention and treatment of decubicus\npressure ulcers and an excessive number of medication errors.\n7.  I also found that the nursing staff complement,\ncomprised of almost 50% temporary contract nurses, failed zo meet\nthe needs of the D.C. Village residents.  Nursing staff was being\nforced to function in a perpetual \"crisis mode.\"  As a resul\",\ni ri\"\n\n- 4 -\nresidents were placed at risk of harm due to the resultina\ninadequate nursing and medical care.\n8.  I re-toured D.C. Village on May 25-25, 1995 and again\non May 3C, 1595.  Again, I observed the routine medical and\nclinical care, management and treatment of residents and sc:-:e\nwith a number of staff.  I conducted interviews with direct care\nstaff, various Registered Nurses  (\"RN\"s) and Licensed Practical\nNurses  (\"L?N\"s> , and  the newly appointed Director of Nursing.\nI-also spoke with a number of residents.  I directly observed the\ncare and treatment of residents with decubitus pressure ulcers\nfeeding of residents, and medication administration.  During the\ntour, I reviewed more documents, including individual resident\nmedical records, medication logs, nursing and physician notes and\norders.\n9.  I found that the deficiencies I identified in the crior\nyear had not been corrected by the District.  I was especially\nconcerned to find that in many instances conditions had\ndeteriorated, placing residents at further increased risk of\nsignificant harm.\n10.  In my opinion, nursing care and treatment at D.C.\nVillage are inadequate and pose a serious, immediate risk of harm\nto D.C. Village residents.\nNursing Care For Residents' Decubitus Ulcers is Inadequate\n11.  A major concern at D.C. Village is the high incidence\nof decubitus ulcers  (i.e., pressure sore ulcers involving skin\ntissue wounds and destruction).  Decubitus ulcers are routinely\n\n- 5 -\nclassified ir. four stages: Stage I (superficial wound); Stare II\n(partial-thickness wound); Stage III  (full-thickness wound  and\nStage IV (deep tissue destruction).\n12.  It is generally accepted that most incidents of\ndecubitus ulcers are preventable and all are treatable if\nidentified at an early stage.  The key is identifying the at-risk\npatient and, where a risk is identified, taking appropriate\npreventive r.easures.\n13 .  Prime candidates for pressure ulcers include the\nelderly, the chronically ill, the immobile, weak and debilitated\nindividuals, nutritionally compromised individuals, residents\nwith altered mental status or who are incontinent, and persons\nwho have decreased sensation and accompanying paralysis.  lue to\nL:I-  (JTC  v ale:.--  OL  LUCSC  i-^iiuiLiijiiO  o.^.  LJ . ^, .  Vlixa^c,  a.  ia_-r\nsegment of I.C. Village's population are prime candidates ftr\ndecubitus pressure ulcers.\n14.  Preventive measures include repositioning patients\nregularly every two hours to take the pressure off any single\narea, introducing pressure-relieving devices, keeping the skin\nclear of urine and feces, assessing nutritional and fluid needs,\ngently cleaning and drying potential skin breakdown areas,\nmassaging around the area with appropriate ointments to improve\ncirculation, and recording site and treatment interventions.\n15.  During my investigation, I asked the charge nurse on\neach unit to identify residents with decubitus ulcers and the\nstage of their skin breakdown.  Facility-wide, over 30 residents\n\nwith decubitus ulcers were identified.  This means that with a\ntotal census of 279, more than I out of every 10 D.C. Village\nresidents suffers from this condition that is largely\npreventable.  Several of the residents had recurrincr decubiti and\nmany had multiple decubitus ulcers.\n16.  In rr.y opinion, D.C. Village residents continue tc\nsuffer unnecessary skin breakdowns that are not being assessed,\nevaluated and treated properly.  The neglect and improper care of\ndecubitus ulcers at D.C. Village has had dire consequences for a\nnumber of residents.\n17.  For example, I observed Claude 3. in the surgical\nclinic after he had been sent there for the treatment of his\ndecubitus ulcers.  Claude has a stage IV decubitus ulcer on his\nright hie and a skin flap closure on his left hip.  He also has\ntwo \"new\" stage II decubiti on his left foot which the treating\nphysician described as resulting from Claude having been left on\nhis left side for prolonged periods.  Claude B.'s decubitus ulcer\non his hip is one of the worst I have seen in my professional\ncareer.  It was deep, red and raw with the skin completely eaten\naway.  It was sickening and hard to view such sores on the body\nof another human being.  Claude kept squirming and crying out\nfrom pain while the treating physician manipulated the ski-\ntissue to examine the wound.  Claude had to be restrained by the\nnurse.  I have seen some pretty hideous bedsores over my 2 3 years\nof nursing practice but this particular sore was horrible and one\nof the worst I have ever seen.  In my opinion, given the\n~m\n\n- 7 -\ninadequate care and treatment, further skin breakdown is ir.-ir.enc\nfor Claude unless corrective action is taken immediately.\nIS.  Claude was in the surgical unit for the treatment cf\n:wo new scare II decubiti chat had developed on his left fccc.  I\nwatched the physician pull off the layer of skin tissue en ccp of\nche decubitus ulcers.  Claude continued to cry out in pain.  The\nskin was red. raw and bruised inside.\n19.  I also observed the decubiti of resident Lamonc ~.. who\nis paralyzed from the neck down.  Lament has no feeling or\nsensation below the neck.  Ke has a decubitus ulcer on his left\nankle that he believes developed when he fell out of bed.  .-.\nsecond decubicus ulcer on the ball of his left foot is now\nborderlire stage III/IV.  In my ooinion, it looks infected.  The\ndecubitus ulcer on his foot was initially detected this past\nFebruary and has not yet healed.  Lament indicates that he\nnoticed urine flowing out of his tennis shoe.  The urine had\nspilled out of Lamont's catheter tubing, down his pants leg and\ninto his shoe.  Upon having his shoe removed by staff, the sore\nwas noticed.  He described the sore as initially being the size\nof the tic of a pencil eraser.  The decubitus ulcer I observed\nlooked infected, was raw and deep and had increased to the size\nof a quarter.\n20.  Another resident, William S., has suffered from\ndecubitus bedsores that were allowed to deteriorate resulting in\nthe recent amputation of William's leg on April 28, 1S95.\nWilliam's medical record documented improper delayed notification\nTT\n\n- s -\nby nursing staff of signs of infection to the physician.  The\nresult was the amputation of William's leg that could have been\navoided and prevented.  William currently suffers from tw;\ndecubitus ulcers.  He has a large hole on his right hip that has\neaten into the muscle that is reported by D.C. Village as a stage\nIII ulcer.  William also suffers from a decubitus ulcer on his\nright butted-: that is raw, red and beginning to eat into muscle\ntissue.  This indicates further breakdown of the skin.  The\nwounds could easily be infected.  I asked the D.C. Village nurse\nif a culture had been taken to see if either of the wounds were\ninfected.  The nurse informed me that none had been ordered.  It\nis accepted nursing practice that a culture should be taken\nanytime a wcuno. LOOKS  suspicious.\n21.  y.v review of William's medical record also indicated\nsignificant lapses in his care and treatment.  William was 4 5\npounds below his ideal body weight prior to his amputation.  I\nsaw no evidence in his record that a nutritional assessment had\nbeen performed.  Even now, William is still 10 pounds under his\nappropriate body weight.  Still, no nutritional assessment has\nbeen performed.  In addition, according to William's record, he\nfailed to receive his supplemental feeding or physician-ordered\nwater bolus  (a procedure in which water is injected to insure\nproper hydration) the day before I commenced my tour at D.C.\nVillage on May 24, 1995.  Given his low weight, such neglect can\nhave dire consequences unless appropriate nursing care is begun\nimmediately.\n\n_ 5 -\n22.  Mcses D. is another recent amputee, having had 'r..s\nright leg amputated on October 17, 19 94 and his left leg en\nFebruary 14, 1995.  Moses currently suffers frocr. two decubitus\nulcers.  I asked the charge nurse to remove Moses' dressinr so\n\"hat I could examine the decubitus ulcer by the base of his\nspine.  I observed that the dressing was saturated with urine.\nThe entire dressing, large portions of his body and the bed\nlinens were scaked.  The best way to describe what I saw was a\npool of urine.  Around the edges, the urine had dried, leaving\nhuge stains.  This indicates to me that Moses had been left\nlaying in his own urine for hours without being checked.  .-.= a\nprofessional nurse, I was appalled by seeing that.  A resident\nreauiring total care who is bed-ridden should never be left for\nlong periods of time without supervision.  A bed-ridden resident\nshould be offered a urinal regularly and checked, at a rr.ir.i~u~,\nevery two hours.  After the charge nurse removed the dressing, I\nobserved that Moses' urine had seeped through and was laying\ndirectly on the wound contaminating the decubitus ulcer.  When I\nasked the charge nurse how often Moses' dressing was changed, I\nwas informed once per day.  In tr.y opinion, this is inadequate.\nThe wound I observed by his spine, near the tailbone, can be\ndescribed as a borderline stage II/III decubitus ulcer.  The\nentire top layer of skin was missing over the entire area.  The\nulcerated area was over 3 inches in diameter and the skin\nbreakdown was complete to the muscle.  I returned a second time\nto review Moses' care four days later on May 30, 1995, and was\n-IT\n\n- 10 -\nutterly appalled to find almost the exact same situation.  Moses\nwas again laying in his bed with a urine soaked dressing over his\ndecubitus ulcers.  The bed was soaking wet.  It appeared chat\nMoses had beer, neglected again for hours.\n23.  My review of Moses' medical chare gives further\nindication cf improper and inadequate care.  The medication\nadministration record  (\"MAR\") documents that nursing staff had\ntwice failed to provide Moses, within the prior week cf my May\n1995 tour, with his physician-ordered water bolus injeccicn\ndeemed necessary to insure adequate hydration.  This failure\nserves to exacerbate Moses' skin breakdown as well as places him\nat risk of dehydration.\n24.  During my tour, staff and residents reported a lazk of\ncore essential supplies normally used to treat decubitus ulcers\nincludinc duoderm taoe, 4x4 cads and Silvadene ointment crem.e.\nOne evening charge nurse reported that the shortages were as\nrecent as the prior week.  When asked about possible shortages,\nanother nurse stated: \"things have gotten better this week.\"  The\nnurse indicated the belief that residents are at risk.  A third\nnurse claimed that there had been numerous food, medication and\nsupply shortages and that they have been short for so long, that\nstaff have lost track of what is and is not available.  Numerous\nother nurses and aides confided in me that supplies ware an on-\nagain/off-again proposition.  A physician indicated that\nshortages of medications, especially antibiotics, had become\n~rr\n\n- II -\ncommonplace ar.d that: the physician was forced, or. occasion, tc\nsubstitute alternative medications.\nAssessing and Monitoring the Nutritional and Feeding N'eeds cf\nResidents is Inadequate\n25.  ~.C. Village residents' nutritional needs are net being\nadequately monitored.  For example, Houston J. had a documented\nweight loss of 24 ocunds in less than three weeks yet no\nr-.utritior.al/-edical assessment had been performed.  Significant\nweight loss such as this can greatly compromise an individual's\nhealth and well-being.  My review of medical records indicated\nthat even residents identified at .risk (e.g., William S. and\nLament R.) had not received nutritional assessments.  Other\nresidents, who had physician-ordered supplemental feedings  e . c.,\nRichard G. and Catherine S.) had documented missed feedings\ntherebv compromising their nutritional well-being.  Moreover, m.v\nreview of recent hospitalization records reveals four residents\n(Houston J., George A., Jeff C,  and Thomas B.) being\nhospitalized between February 1595 and May 1995 with a listed\ndiagnosis of dehydration.\n25.  Despite the fact that I had identified the failure to\nproperly and adequately assess individuals at risk for swallowing\nproblems during the prior year's tour, I observed minimal\ncorrective action.  In fact, I observed a poster in the lobby of\nthe facility which announced that a \"Dysphagia Clinic\" was just\nbeing kicked off the first day of my investigative tour -- nearly\na full year after my prior tour.  During my investigation, I\n\n- 12 -\nobserved a significant failure to adequately monitor residents\nduring meal times.  This failure places many D.C. Village\nresidents at risk of aspirating which is an extremely dangerrus,\npotentially life-threatening situation.\nRisk of Medication Errors is Excessive at D.C. Village\n27.  During my investigative tour, I found evidence cf many\nmedication errors.  On one unit,  (Unit 3A) , a review of the\nmedication administration record (\"MAR\") and the corresponding\nmedication blister packs revealed huge discrepancies.\nMedications were being documented as having been given when it\nwas clear that they had not been administered.  For chat cr.^\nunit, encompassing over 30 residents, the medication count was\noff for every single resident reviewed.  While on the same unit,\nthe record of one resident, Charles L., indicated that he was to\nbe given a dose of Dilantin elixir  (a medication to control\nseizures) twice a day.  The record indicated that Charles hai\nalready received one dosage that day and was scheduled to receive\na second dosage at 5:00 that afternoon.  I asked to see the\nsupply of the afternoon's medication.  I was informed that they\nwere out of the medication and that pharmacy would be supplying\nthe medication later that day.  Later that evening, I returned to\nthe unit to ascertain whether the medication had indeed come in\nand had been administered.  I was informed that the medication\nhad not as yet arrived.  However, upon reviewing the MAR, the\nmedication had been marked as having already been administered to\nCharles.  When confronted, the medication nurse admitted that the\n\n- 13 -\nrecord was indeed inaccurate and that the medication had net been\ngiven.  This type of nursing practice grossly violates accepted\nnursing standards and is professionally unjustifiable.\n28.  Cn another unit, I found a discrepancy in the\nadministration of Houston J.'s Dilantin  (seizure medication\nbetween May 12, 1995 and May 25, 1995.  I personally verified\nthree missed dosacres of Dilantin bv counting t^e m^dic—.- io~s i~\nHouston's blisterpack which revealed an excess number.  In face,\nthe medical record indicates that the treating physician, after\ndocumenting an inappropriate blood level, was forced to order a\none-time increased level dosage to compensate for the blood\nlevel.\n29.  Another example cf the frequent medication errors is\nEdward S. whe has an order for phenobarbital  (a medication often\nused to control seizures).  My review of the MAR indicated thac\nEdward had not been given his anti-seizure medication twice in\nthe prior week, on May 12 and again on May 18th.\n30.  I found medication errors to be a systemic, on-going\nproblem exacerbated by a nursing staff that is understaffed,\nover-burdened and confronted with the prevalent use of temporary\nagency/contract nurses who are not adequately familiar with the\nneeds of D.C. Village residents.\nNurse Staffing at D.C. Village is Inadequate\n31.  I continue to find nurse staffing at D.C. Village to be\nprofessionally unsound and dangerous.  In my opinion, the\n\n- 14 -\nexisting nurse staffing at D.C. Village continues to operate in a\nperpetual  \"crisis mode.\"\n32.  I fcund the problems to be exacerbated by the crevalent\nuse of agency,'contracc nurses at D.C. Village.  Agency/contract\nnursing staff remains at just under 50 percent of total shift\ncoverage within the facility.  I found such widespread use cf\nacrencv''contract nurses to cresent serious risks to t'^^ ^ —s\" ~'~ a^d\nsafety of che D.C. residents because several individual members\nof the contract staff did not know the naT.es and identities tf\nthe residents to whom they were providing care and nursing\nservices and administering medications.\n33.  For example, on one unit I toured, both nurses on duty\nwere temporary agency/contract nurses who were not able t answe\nbasic questions about che residents without looking at the\nrecords.  Specifically, neither nurse could identify che\nresidents when asked.  Neither could identify any of the\nresidents' needs, treatment, or medication regimen.  Every\nquestion was responded to with \"let me look it up.\"  This cver-\nreliance on temporary staff is inappropriate and dangerous in a\nfacility such as D.C. Village where continuity of care and\nfamiliarity with residents are critical to ensure adequate safety\nand treatment.\n34.  Staff must be acutely aware of residents' needs and\nalert and responsive to often subtle changes requiring\nintervention.  Inadequate and inappropriate staffing has resulted\nin residents not receiving the care and attention they require.\n\n- 15 -\n35.  Nursing staff, overburdened,  short-staffed,  ar.d czzer.\nunfamiliar wi~h zhe  individuals' needs have and continue  :: fail\nto meet  the basic needs of D.C. Village residents.  For exa-.cle,\nbed-ridden  residents are reportedly bathed only every three  days\nat bas~.  Moreover, as indicated earlier, bed-ridden  residents\nare not turned on a regular basis to prevent or minimize\nincidewi~s o ~ d e ^ ub ^ t u s ulca'y*s.  L)ue to i-Vt^ \"! a ^ k of s ^~ a ~ *~  b—\"~ \"n\nnumbers and training, residents are ofcen not provided v/izh\nneeded therapy despite orders for such in the individuals'\nrecords.  For example, Byrd A. had not received her  prescribed\nskin care regimen twice during the week prior to my 'tour.\nDressings are changed  infrequently and, as personally  observed,\nare often urine-soaked by the time they are changed.  Nursing\nstaff  roucineiy  fail to monitor individual weights and respond  to\nindividual nutritional needs in a timely fashion.\n36.  During my three-day tour, I never saw a single  resident\nbeing given appropriate range of motion exercises.  In face, what\nI did observe was residents routinely being left unattended.  For\nexamcle,  I observed Catherine S. left  in a posey vest  (a\nrestraint  used to prevent  falling).  I was concerned  whether\nresidents were being released periodically  for range of  motion\nexercises.  My review of Catherine's record was quite  remarkable.\nThe record verified  that the entire evening shift the day before\nhad gone by with no charted restraint release by staff.  What was\nmore  remarkable, however, was that the night shift, which had not\nyet begun, had already documented  in Catherine's record  that  she\n\n- 16 -\nid been periodically released from the posey vest restr=\n•.roughout the night.  This is a significant departure f:\n:ofessior.al cractice standards.\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoi:\n1\n:rue and accurate.

No.  95-94 3  TFI-1\nTHE DISTRi: 0? COLUMBIA, et.\nDefendants. DECLARATION  OF\nSAUNDRA  BAUGH\nPursuar.- to the provisions of 2 5 U.S.C. § 174 5 and L.Z.Z. ?..\n10S(h), I, Saundra Baugh, do hereby declare:\n1.  I have been a resident of the D.C. Village Nursing Home\n(\"DCV\") for the past fourteen years.  I presently live en \"Jnii 23\nin a small room with two elderly women.\n2.  I am currently 42 years old.  I require nursing care\nbecause at acre 20, I suffered an injury that caused mv seine to\nbe partially severed, leaving me paralyzed frorr. the waist down.\nThe injury also left me unable to use rr.y fingers.  I a- now\nconfined :o a wheelchair, and arr. largely dependent on staff zc\nmeet my basic care needs.  I must live at DCV because I have no\nwhere else to go.\n3.  In recent months, basic care services for the residents\nhave deteriorated at DCV.  There have been severe shortages of\nfood and drink, hot water, medications, and medical supplies.\nMs. Brasfield, the DCV facility director, has told me that the\ncity's budget crisis has put DCV in a \"difficult situation\" and\nhas caused many of these shortages.  As a result, the DCV staff\n\nhave had tc do the best they can.  Yet, in spite of their\nefforts, the residents have suffered because of the shortages.\n4.  Because individuals fror, the Department of Justice and\nother outside surveyors were present at the facility during the\nweek of May 23-30, 1995, basic services to residents were\nenhanced ar.i increased to make it appear to the outsiders as if\nthere were no basic care shortages.  However, this is misleading.\nFor example, the meals served to us that week were of better\nquality and greater quantity than they had been for months.  The\nfacility alv.-ays puts on a good show for the surveyors, yet poor\nservices alv;ays return once the outsiders leave.  I fully\nanticipate this happening again.\n5.  In 1995, food shortages have adversely affected\nresident care and residents' quality of life.  As a substitute\nfor meat, the staff have repeatedly served us peanut butter\nsandwiches for dinner and lunch.  With the peanut butter, we are\nserved only vater to drink, not juice.  Before the surveyors\narrived last week, we had not been served salad or fresh\nvegetables for months.  In fact, on the day the outsiders first\narrived, we were given salt, pepper, sugar and juice at lunch and\ndinner for the first tins in months.\n6.  Last year, neals were tolerable.  This year, meals are\nextremely unappetizing and practically inedible.  Sometimes, I\ncan't even figure out what's been served.  When a hot meal is\nattempted, the food is usually either undercooked or overcooked,\nleaving it too hard, or soggy and watery.  This year, I have\n- 2 -\n\noften beer, u.-.able to eat what's been served and am left to buy my\nown food.\n7.  Iz is quite often the case that staff either forget to\nbring me ny real tray, or they bring roe a meal which I simply\ncannot eat.  I am unable to drink milk or eat certain kinds of\nfish.  If I eat salmon, for example, I will usually vomit.  I'm\npretty sure I'm allergic to such foods, but I've never been\ntested.  Nonetheless, I'n continually served such inappropriate\nfoods.  When I alert the staff of this, they have either brought\nme back just a sandwich, cr they have left me with nothing to\neat.  I have told my dietician repeatedly about my individual\nfeeding needs, yet nothing ever seens to come of it.  I know this\nhappens to ether residents as well.\nS.  There have beer, medication shortages this year that\ndirectly affect resident health and welfare.  I have been left\nwithout needed medication simply because the facility did not\nhave it.  For example, a few weeks ago, the pharmacy did not have\nmy prescribed allergy medicine for about two weeks.  Because the\nmedicine was not available, the doctor changed my prescription to\nan inappropriate sinus medicine until the allergy medicine was\nagain available.  During this time, I awoke most mornings\ncongested and stopped up, unable to speak clearly for awhile.\nThe pharmacy also recently ran out of the medication I need in\norder to control my muscle spasms.  I was without this important\nmedication for a few days.\n- 3 -\n\n9.  There are also severe shortages of medical supplies.\nFor example, I, along with many other DCV residents, suffer from\nbed or pressure sores called decubiti.  I currently have such\nsores on my buttocks.  In properly treating these sores in the\npast, DCV staff have used duoderm tape.  The duoderm tape works\nwell at protecting the sore and helping it heal faster.  However,\nin recent r.onths, there has been no duoderm tape available at\nDCV.  The staff are left to improvise, treating sores with a\ncombination of gauze, ointment and four by four's.  This\ntreatment is not sufficient.  The make-shift patch used on my\nsores often becomes dislodged, leaving the sensitive sore exposed\nand subject to further irritation.  Without the duoderm tape, the\npatch never stays in place properly.  As an aside, I've  learned\nthat some are claiming that decubiti only develops at the outside\nhospitals ar.d not at DCV; this is simply not true.  I've bee-\nhospitalized often, and yet I've never developed decubiti\nanywhere but at DCV.\n10.  There are shortages of other needed supplies.\nCurrently, there are few if any toothbrushes, combs, brushes,\nsoap, lotion, paper towels, and regular sized cups made available\nto the residents.  I have seen staff bring in soap from the\noutside, buying it with their own money, simply because the\nfacility had run out.  We are forced to use very small cups that\nsimply don't hold enough liquid.  I have been able to get myself\nover to the dentist's office to obtain a new toothbrush, but\nother residents who do not have that ability are left to use\n- 4 -\n\ntheir old toothbrushes for too long.  In addition, blood pressure\ncuffs are our of date, so the nurses bring in their own for use\nwith the residents.  DCV also has a shortage of light bulbs and\nfluorescent lights.  I noticed replacement fluorescent lighcs\ninstalled only upon the outside surveyors' arrival.\n11.  We are never guaranteed to receive adequate hot water\nfor bathing at DCV.  About a month ago, we were without hot water\non my unit for an entire week.  The facility had put up sigr.s on\nsome units warning the residents that the hot water was net\navailable to them.  During that tine, it was too cold for anyone\non my unit to bathe or to take a shower.  I was forced to not\ntake a shower or a bath at all that week.  At other tines, the\nwater is merely warm.  Sor.etimes, we are forced to take a sponge\nbath because the water is not hot enough.  As an aside, I'-\nsupposed to be bathed at least twice a week, but I'm usually only\nbathed once a week.\n12.  The lack of adequate hot water has rendered the\nfacility unable to wash and properly sanitize dishes and eating\nutensils.  As a result, in 1995, we have used plastic utensils\nand paper plates more often than we have used silverware and\ndishes.  It is very important that silverware be available for\nthe DCV residents.  Some elderly and medically infirm individuals\ncannot eat or be fed properly with the plastic \"sporks\" used at\nDCV.  The \"spork\" is a combination spoon and fork with sharp\nplastic prongs at the end.  I've seen DCV residents poked in the\nmouth, tongue and chin when these \"sporks\" are used.  I've even\n- 5 -\n\nheard the staff say aloud that they can't feed the residents with\nthe plastic utensils.\n13.  Clothes often cone back from the laundry still stained\nand shrunken.  Tovels look dirty; diapers return stained ar.d\nshrunken with rusted snaps.  The diapers given to me have beco-e\nso shrunken, that the staff have had to double-up the width of\nwhat's left just to meet my needs.  This doubling is\nuncomfortable and inadequate.  In addition, residents' clothing .\nis often stolen or lost when sent out to the laundry.\n14.  A few weeks ago, ny wheelchair was in need of repair.\nIt was taken to the repair shop for an entire week.  I had had an\nalternate wheelchair to use for such occasions, but it was stolen\na few months ago while I was at an outside hospital.  Thus, while\nmy chair was being fixed, I was left without the use of a\nwheelchair altogether.  As a result, I was confined to bed for\nthe whole week while I waited for my wheelchair to be returned.\n15.  During the time I was forced to remain in bed while my\nwheelchair was being repaired, the nursing and direct care staff\nfailed to attend to my basic needs.  For example, while in bed,\nI'm dependent on staff to help me go to the bathroom.  However,\nduring that week, staff regularly left me in bed wet with urine\nfor 10-12 hours at a time after I had been incontinent.  Needless\nto sav, it is very uncomfortable, unhealthy and embarrassing to\nbe left wet for such a long time.  I know it can't have helped my\nbed sores.\n- 6 -\n\n16.  I've noticed such neglect affecting other DCV\nresidents.  Just recently, I noticed residents with Alzheir.er's\ndisease left: in fecal matter for hours simply because the staff\nneglected to check on them.  Typically, incontinent residents are\nleft to sir in their own feces from 1:00  in the afternoon until\nafter 6:00 a~ night.  This has happened quite regularly during my\nstay here at DCV.  Nurses are supposed to be monitoring the\nresidents, bu- many of thsr. sit at the nursing station all day\ntalking.  Sor.e take pride in their work, but others could care\nless.\n17.  The nurses do not tend to our other basic care needs.\nAs I indicated, I an unable to use my fingers, so I can't brush\nmy own teeth.  Nonetheless, no staff person or nurse had brushed\nmy teeth for the entire week before the outside surveyors\narrived.  The evening of their arrival, however, a staff person\nbrushed my teeth.  The last time my teeth had been brushed was at\nthe dentist's office a week earlier.\nIS.  The nurses who work at DCV on a part-time, contract\nbasis, lack familiarity with the residents and our needs.  This\nhas a real impact on resident care.  For example, I never know\nwho's going to be here and when.  Because the contract nurses are\nnot familiar with us, they improperly treat residents' decubiti.\nThey have improperly treated mine.  Contract nurses also\nconstantly make medication errors.  I invariably have to tell the\nnurses what medications I take and when I take them.  Often I\nhave to correct the nurses after they hand me the wrong pills at\n- 7 -\n\nthe wrong time.  Even after I correct their mistake, if it's just\na timing error, the contract nurses often encourage me to take\nthe pills that they've given me at the time anyway.  The\npermanent nurses regularly make mistakes as well.  They often try\nto dispense r.edications by memory, which can certainly lead to\nerrors.  Both contract and permanent nurses pass out medications\nby hand instead of using a small paper cup as they are supposed\nto.  They also do not wash \"heir hands when, moving from person to\nperson providing services.\n19.  For nurses ar DCV, paperwork is core important than the\nresidents.  Nurses often write entries in the record without\ninteracting with or saying a word to the residents.  Many rir.es,\nthey will write in the record that they have done something, like\nchange a dressing for a bed sore, yet they will have not dene\nanything at all.  I typically have to ask the nurses to do things\nfor ne that are supposed to be done routinely anyway.\n20.  Generally, the staff treat us in a disrespectful\nmanner.  They often do not talk to us at all or if they do, they\nwill talk to us as children.  They've made degrading c0-.-sr.-5 to\nme such as \"Move, so I can get that junk off your table.\"  In\ndealing with other residents, I've heard staff comment aloud, \"I\ncan't stand  [resident's name].\"  The staff will do as little for\nyou as possible, and they will only do something for you if they\nare your assigned nurse.  I've asked other nurses to help ne, and\nI've been rebuffed because the person was not assigned to r.e.\n- S -\n\nThe staff tend to holler loudly at one another.  This just adds\nto the stress and frustration level at the facility.\n21.  Staff routinely call in sick and/or take annual leave,\nleaving the units short staffed.  I believe absenteeism nay be so\nhigh because each nurse's caseload is so heavy.  I would estimate\nthat over half the time we do not have enough nurses on the unit.\nThe nurse shortage means that they cannot attend to the needs of\nthe full care residents.  There always seems to be a shortage of\nnurses and staff on the weekends.  Even when we do have cur full\ncomplement, the nurses are invariably pulled from other units.\nThat means they are not familiar with us or our needs.\n22.  I do net receive sufficient physical therapy a~ DC'.'.  I\nhad only been receiving range of notion therapy three times a\nweek.  I understand that ultrasound and massage have just been\ncancelled.  I've  lost a lot of mobility since I arrived at BCV.\n23.  The doctors do not coma around to check up on us\nregularly.  My doctor never cones around to see me on his ovr.\ninitiative; he only comes by when asked.  Upon my return to DCV\nfrom a recent hospitalization, my doctor merely took my vital\nsigns and did not talk to me or ask me about my needs or past\ncare.\n24.

R.\n105(h), I, Charles Burgess, do hereby declare:\n1.  Ia~ the son of Willie Burgess, who was a reside-- at\nD.C. Village  (\"DCV\") for about three years before his death or.\nAugust 20, 1994.\n2.  My father had Alzheimer's disease and he needed tccai\nand complete basic care services.  I tried to care for hirr. myself\nat nay home, but after a year, I found I was ultimately unable to\njuggle work and meec his needs adequately.  He needed 24-hour\ncare.\n3.  I was very dissatisfied with the care my father\nreceived at DCV.  As soon as I placed him at DCV, his health\ndeteriorated rapidly.  When I would visit him, I often found that\nmy father had been sitting in his own feces or laying in bed full\nof his own feces.  The smell was awful.  The nursing staff had\ncompletely neglected to meet his needs.  I was left to clean him\nup and change him myself.  The staff would only act when I would\ncomplain.  In fact, care always got worse the longer I stayed\n\naway from the facility.  Only when I spoke up all the tine, did\nthe staff ever act to provide anything to my father.  I was told\nthat unless I visited DCV every single day, the care would not be\nadequate to meet my father's needs; otherwise, he would be\nignored.  That was true.\n4.  Before my father entered DCV, he was able to walk well.\nHowever, the DCV staff stopped walking him and he gradually lost\nthe ability -co walk entirely.  Eventually, he couldn't walk at\nall.  By the tine of his death, his legs were completely drawn up\nto his chest in a fetal position.  He couldn't straighten them\nout any more.  I attribute this deterioration solely to the\nneglect of the DCV staff.  In fact, every single time I visited\nmy father, he was sitting doing nothing.  The staff never\ninteracted with him.\n5.  At the time of his death, my father had become\nafflicted with severe bed sores.  Before entering DCV, r.y father\nhad never suffered with bed sores.  The sores started appearing a\nfew months after placement at DCV.  They kept getting worse.  At\nfirst, the bed sores were just large; then they became deep too.\nBy the time he had reached the hospital just prior to his death,\nthe hospital doctor showed me that the sores on his buttocks were\nso deep, he could put his hand in them.  I saw these sores\npersonally, and I can attest that the sores were humongous.\n6.  At DCV, my father had been left to develop deep bed\nsores on his back and his legs.  Given the size of the leg sores\nand the potential for infection, it was decided that the best\n- 2 -\n\ncourse of action would be to have both his legs amputated.  This\nwas done at the hospital.  Given my father's frail health, he\ndied a few days later.  The sores developed in the first place\nbecause the DCV staff had failed to keep my father walking and\nactive and because they failed to properly turn my father while\nhe was on the bed.\n6.  Whenever I visited ny father, his clothes were always\nmissing.  I had bought him a lot of new clothes -- pants, shoes,\nsocks, underwear.  I spent about $500 on the clothing.  However,\nthe next tir.e I visited, it was all gone.  I never saw r.y\nfather's clothing again.  Vihar>. I visited him, he always seerr.ed to\nbe dressed in a raggedy pair of pants that were two or three\nsizes too big for him.\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct.

A boiler motor and pump circulate hot\nwater for use in other parts of a building.  Over the course of\nthree days, we surveyed the job and concluded that the motor in\nquestion was burned up and not able to be repaired.  We provided\nDCV with an estimate on the cost of repairing the hot water unit,\nhowever, we did not hear back from them to repair it.  Finally,\nin late January or early February 1995, we were called back to\nDCV to do the work as originally quoted.  By this time, the\nboiler pump had become completely locked from having sat idle for\nso long.  We repaired the boiler pump, checked it for leaks and\nreplaced the boiler motor with a new Toshiba 15 horsepower motor.\n\n4.  On February 28, 1995, we billed the District $4,440.33\nfor the repair of the hot water boiler, yet to this day, vs have\nstill not been paid.

Generally, SRT\nprovides supplemental nurse staffing and other health rela-ei\nservices for hospitals, nursing homes and private individuals.\n2.  Pursuant to a contract with the District of Coluriia,\nSRT has provided nurses for D.C. Village  (\"DCV\") on an as-needed\nbasis for the past several years.\n3.  As of June 1, 1995, the District owes SRT at lease\n$251,401.89 in past due amounts for services we have rendered at\nDCV.  Some outstanding invoices date back to 1994.  I have\nattached a letter sent to Ms. Alberta Brasfield, the DCV\nExecutive Director, and a computer printout detailing the monies\npast due.\n4.  Because of the District's failure to pay us, we have\nhad to cancel all contract nursing services with DCV.  We\n\nofficially stopped furnishing nurses to DCV at 11:00 p.m. or.\nFriday, June 2, 199 5.\n5.  Since we stopped supplying DCV with nurses, I have\nspoken with Mr. Vernon Hawkins, the Interim Director of the\nDistrict's Department of Human Services.  He said his Department\nwas working on getting us the money we are owed, but he was not\nultimately able to furnish me with a time when, in fact, we would\nget paid.\n6.  SRT pays in full the nurses who work at DCV shortly\nafter they complete their work there.  We continue to bill the\nDistrict for these services, but we do not receive payment.  As a\nresult, SRT is forced to assume the financial burden of paying\nits employees without reimbursement from the District Government.\nIf the District doesn't pay us, we are simply not able to\ncontinue to provide services.  Our banking relationships will not\nfinance receivables aged over ninety days.  Thus, our financial\nsituation and our banks simply will not tolerate the District's\nindefinite non-payment.\n7.  On many different occasions, I had alerted District\nofficials that if they did not pay us, our company would be\nforced to terminate our services to DCV.  In fact, I have spent\nmuch of my time the last three weeks simply trying to get payment\nfrom the District for services rendered at DCV.  I have called\neveryone I know to call to try to obtain payment.  In the\nattached letter, I have partially detailed the individuals I've\nspoken with in attempting to resolve this matter.  Unfortunately,\n- 2 -\n\nsome individuals would not return my calls until I left a r.essage\nwith the nagic words that we were threatening to terminate\nservices.  Ozher District officials actually argued with r.s that\nwe would not be paid because we were not working under a valid\ncontract.

My\nprofessional career has been devoted to treating elderly patients\nin long-term care settings as well as teaching, writing, and\nstudying about the provision of long-term care for the geriatric\npopulation.\n2.  To acquaint the Court with my specific qualifications,\nI provide a summary of my background below.  My curriculum vitae,\nwhich is attached to my Declaration, provides further details\nabout my experiences and qualifications.\nBACKGROUND, EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION\n3.  Educational background:  I received my medical degree\nfrom Baylor College of Medicine in 1931 and my Master's Degree in\n\nPublic Health from the University of Texas in 1991.  My residency\nwas ir. internal medicine and I served a fellowship specializing\nin geriatrics a; the Baylor College of Medicine.\n4.  Academic experience:  I am an Associate Professor cf\nMedicine, Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, at -he\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n5.  Administrative and clinical experience:  In Ju1v 15 94,\nI was appointed and currently hold the position of Medical\nDirector at the Johns Hopkins Geriatric Center.  In this\ncapacity, - am. responsible for overseeing the medical care and\ntreatment fcr the residents of the Geriatric Center, a lor.~-term\ncare facility affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Health System.\nPrior to my appointment, I served as Associate Medical Director,\nfirst at the Lorien Frankford Nursing and Rehabilitation Center\nCenter.\n6.  Professional Activities:  I am board certified in the\nfield of internal medicine and have a specialty certification in\ngeriatrics.  I have also been granted the status of \"Fellow\" by\nthe American College of Physicians.  I am an active member in the\nAmerican Geriatrics Society, the American Medical Directors'\nAssociation and the Gerontologicai Society of America.\n7.  Publications:  I have published extensively on a\nvariety of topics in the field of geriatric medicine, including\narticles, book chapters, monographs, manuals, and other\npublications in respected professional journals and treatises in\n- 2 -\n-i-n\n\nthe field cf gerontology.  Recent: articles and book reviews\ninclude: The Current and Future Role of the Medical Director,-\nN'ursinc Home Medicine; Abuse and Neglect of Elderlv Persons\nLiving in Nursing Homes.- Prevention and Intervention, and Medical\nPractice in Cursing Facilities: Assessing the Impact cf OB?-1..  In\naddition, I have been an invited speaker at numerous symposiums,\ngrand rounds and annual meetings cf medical associations.  My\npublications and presentations have focused extensively on long-\nterm care and treatment.\nS  Zvc6rt Witness activities aird exo~iV*ionc-n i77 ~ .^ ~ ^ t ~ r—\ncare related litigation:  I have served as an expert consultant\nand witness in cases involving professional standards for long\nterm care.  I have worked for both defendants and plaintiffs and\nfor the federal government.  In addition, I have been qualified\nas an expert witness in court on matters involving appropriate\nmedical care and on geriatrics and long term care.  I have worked\nwith t1r\"e United States Department of Justice since 3.990 in the\nrjonjrhrnanr's investigation and enforcement activities under the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\").  In this\ncaoacity, I have been involved with CRIPA investigations in\nseveral states including Mew York and Virginia and the one CRIPA\ninvestigation in the District of Columbia.\nINVOLVEMENT WITH THIS CASE AND FAMILIARITY WITH D.C. VILLAGE\nNURSING HOMS\n9.  In April 1994, I was asked by the Department of Justice\nto serve as an expert consultant to assess the care and treatment\n- 3 -\n\nof residents at the D.C. Village Nursing Home in Washington, D.C.\nI first toured D.C. Village on June 6-7, 1994.  Prior to the\ntour, I reviewed numerous documents provided by D.C. Viilare,\nincluding policies and procedures of the facility, internal\nreports and summaries, consultations, treatment protocols, and\ninjury, hospicalization and death records.  During the\ninvestigative tour, I observed, among other things, routine\nmedical and health care, routine management, training and\ntreatment of residents within their living units, as well as\nmeals on che living units.  In addition, I reviewed resident\ncharts and interviewed multiple staff members.\n10.  Mv assessment of the care and treatment of D^. C^. Village\nresidents in 1994 revealed a number of critical deficiencies.\nThe medical care and related treatment provided to the residents\nwere far below accepted professional standards.  Of most\nimmediate concern, because of the continual risk of death to the\nresidents, were the deficiencies noted in feeding residents and\ncare and treatment of residents with increased risk of aspiration\n(i.e., inhaling food or fluids into the lungs).  I found that\nD.C. Village residents had been needlessly subjected to prolonged\nsuffering and discomfort punctuated by repeated hospitaiizations\nmerely because the medical staff was unable to adequately assess\nor respond to the residents' aspiration risk or dysphagia\n(difficulty in swallowing).  I found a shockingly high number of\nD.C. Village residents having died due to some form of\naspiration, pneumonia or feeding dysfunction.\n- & -\n\"ITT\n\n11.  _ ccured D.C. Village agair. or. Tuesday, May 30, 1—5.\nAgain, I observed the routine medical ar.d health care, the\nmanagement ar.d treatment of resider.cs, feeding practices a:\nmealtimes ar.d the care and treatment provided to residents wich\ndecubitus pressure ulcers.  I reviewed individual medical\nrecords, spcke with a number of staff and residents, and reviewed\nthe death reccrds of a number of residents who had died during\nthe past year.\n12.  I determined that the deficiencies I had idert\"^i—d\nlas- year had not been corrected by the District.  I was\ndistressed tc find that conditions had deteriorated even further,\nplacing residents at increased risk of significant harm.\nInadequate Care of Decubitus Ulcers Jeopardizes the Health and\nLives of D.C. Village Residents\n13 .  Durincr rav recent investicative tour  I found ru^^r^u3\nexamples of inadequate care of decubiti  (pressure sore ulcers\ninvolving skin tissue wounds and destruction).  D.C. Village\nresidents continue to suffer unnecessary skin breakdowns that are\nnot being assessed, evaluated and treated properly.\n14.  In order to assist the Court, I will briefly describe\nthe various szages typically ascribed to decubitus ulcers.\nDecubitus ulcers are routinely classified in four stages ranging\nfrom stage I (superficial wound, reddened skin), stage II\n(partial-thickness wound, broken skin) , stage III  (full-thickness\nwound, damage has extended beyond superficial tissue to the deep\ntissues below and may involve drainage) to stage IV  (deep tissue\n- 5 -\n\ndestruction extending  to the muscle or bone).  Once skin is\nbroken,  infection often sets in.  Extensive  infection can lead to\nsepsis  (overwhelming  infection of the body) which,  in turn,  tften\nleads to death especially  in this population.\n15.  It is generally accepted  that most decubitus ulcers  are\npreventable  and ail are treatable  if identified at an early\nstage.  The key is identifying the at-risk patient and  caking\nappropriate preventive measures where an incident might occur.\nic  2-~-*~roor^a~e o r e v ^\"~ ~ *^ v ^ measures  ^ ^c' ud^ v\"^r)O=:^~''~\"\"*\"~cr\npatients on a regular basis, introducing  pressure-relieving\ndevices  (e.c., air mattress properly  inflated, gel pads,  special\nbeds,  elbow and/or heel protectors),  assessing nutritional  and\nfluid needs, gently cleaning and drying potential areas of  skin\nbreakdown, massaging around the reddened area for at least  2 1\nseconds and recording  site and treatment  interventions.\n17.  As a result of my investigative  tour, I find a general\nsystemic  failure by D.C. Village to adequately assess  residents\nat risk, as well as a systemic failure  to take  appropriate\npreventive measures.  Moreover, the neglect and improper care of\ndecubitus ulcers at D.C. Village has had dire consequences  fcr a\nnumber of residents.\n18.  The pervasiveness and seriousness of decubitus  ulcers\nat D.C. Village and the facility's  inability to prevent  and  treat\nthem are apparent  from statistics provided by D.C. Village.\nThere are at least 3 0 D.C. Village residents, or more than one\nout of every ten people who live there, who currently  have\n- 6 -\n\ndecubitus ulcers.1  The tragic consequences of the facility's\nfailure to prevent decubiti ir. the first instance and tc\nadequately treat it or.ce it emerges are also apparent fro- recent\nhospitaiizations of D.C. Village residents for serious\ncomplications fro— decubiti.\n19.  For example, on February IS, 1935, George A. had tc be\nhospitalized for two weeks due to dehydration and a possible\ninfected decubitus ulcer.  On March 24, 1995, Marie D. had tc be\nhospitalized for amputation of her left leg due, reportedly, due\nto infected decubitus ulcers. On April 13, 1995, William S. had\nto be hosoitaiized for two weeks due to a septic right knee.  On\nApril 23, 1995, William's leg was amputated above the knee due to\nnecrosis and gangrene.  Within the past year, at least seven\ndifferent D.C. Village residents  (William S., Marco W., Otis S.,\nJames M., Violet F., Stanley L. and Marie D.) had to have limbs\nated.\n20.  The life-threatening consequences of decubitus ulcers\namong D.C. Village residents are equally apparent.  For example,\nD.C. Village lists \"multiple decubitus ulcers\" as a cause of\ndeath for John B. on March 9, 1995.  Similarly, D.C. Village\nidentifies \"multiple decubitus ulcers\"  as one of the causes of\nthe May 5, 1995 death of Marie D. who, as mentioned previously,\n1  In addition to the 30 individuals identified by D.C.\nVillage, I personally observed at least one other resident,\nLamont R., not identified by D.C. Village, who had multiple\ndecubitus ulcers.\n- 7 -\n\"•IT  1  1  WT\n\nwas hospitalized in March for amputation of her left leg due :o\nir.fecced decubitus ulcers.\n21.  Many of the recent D.C. Village hospitaiizatior.s ar.d\ndeaths are listed as sepsis.  Sepsis is the body's response tc\noverwhelming infection.  A decubitus ulcer can and often 1= a\nmajor contributing factor to the resulting sepsis.  In the recent\ntwo month period, alone, between March 10, 1995 and May 5, 1?95,\nthree different D.C. Village residents were hospitalized with a\ndiagnosis of sepsis.  In the cwo month period between March 22,\n1995 and May 23, 1995, seven other D.C. Village residents were\nhospitalized to rule out a diagnosis of sepsis.\n22.  Mv observations and review of individual records\nverified the inadequate care of decubiti at D.C. Village. .-_r.\nexample is Claude 3. who I observed on the surgical unit.\nClaude's decubitus ulcer on his hip is dusty blue and red, with\nunhealthy tissue.  If I were to describe the wound to a lay\nperson, I would say it looks like old hamburger.  Ke has a hole\nin his right hip that is approximately 6 centimeters.  Below that\nopening, beneath the surface the wound extends for another ten\ncentimeters, through the muscle and down to the bone.  The entire\ndecubitus ulcer is, in actuality, about fiffteen to eighteen\ncentimeters.  Ke has two other decubitus ulcers on his foot.\n23.  Claude was in the surgical unit for the treatment of\nthe two decubitus ulcers on his left foot.  I observed the\nphysician pull off the dead skin revealing a stage III wound with\ndead tissue down to the muscle.  The physician then treated the\n-n\n\nfoot ulcer with Che ointment Elase.  Elase, used to debride dead\ntissue, is rarely used or. foot ulcers because of the danger of\nhaving the ointment spread to adjacent healthy tissue.  The\nphysician spread the Eiase liberally beyond the r.ecrocic/dead\ntissue of the ulcer onto healthy skin.  If extended beyond the\nnecrotic area, the result is that healthy adjacent tissue may be\ndamaged, resulting in extending the decubitus ulcers.  The result\nwas that the I.C. Village \"cure\" could actually exacerbate the\nproblem. Due to the inadequate care being rendered, Claude is now\nat high risk ot having his v/cuncis becoming infected and is  m\ndanger of potentially losing his leg unless corrective action is\ntaken immediately.\n24.  I also observed the decubitus ulcers of Lamont R., who\nis quadriplegic, totally paralyzed from the neck down.  Lament\nhas two decubitus ulcers on his left foot.  Lamont's medical\nrecord indicates two inappropriate physician orders.  First,\nthere is a SC-day order for Eiase, which is inappropriate for a\nfoot ulcer.  Second, there is an order for Intrasite on the dead\ntissue.  Intrasite is an gel product normally used to enhance\ngranulation tissue growth.  It is totally ineffective and\ninappropriate to be ordered to treat necrotic/dead skin.  Such\norders are a significant departure from professional standards\nand place Lamont at risk of imminent harm.  I am very concerned\nthat the inadequate treatment has led to a progression of\nLamont's wounds and predisposes him to potentially losing a limb\nunnecessarily.\n- 9 -\nTTT  r\n\n25.  Another resident that I am quite concerned about is\nHouston J.  Houston currently has two decubitus ulcers, one on\nhis left foot and one on his right heel.  The right heel wound is\na stage III decubitus ulcer that has significant dead/necrctic\ntissue that needs surgical attention for debridemer.t.  My review\nof his record shows no request for a surgical consult.  The\nfailure to properly debride such a wound of dead tissue is a\ndeparture from professional standards and places Houston at\nimminent risk that the wound will get larger and get infected.\nPotentially, Houston if not adequately treated imminently, risks\na potential loss of limb, sepsis, and even possibly death.\n25.  Another example of the inadequate care being rendered\nat D.C. Village is William S. who, after suffering from decubitus\nbe.d sores that were allowed to deteriorate, had to have his leg\namputated in April 1995.  The amputation was a direct result of\ninadequate care and neglect coupled with improper delayed\nnotification by nursing staff of signs of infection.  The result\nwas the amputation of a resident's leg that could have been\nprevented.\n27.  William's medical record reveals that on March 17,\n1995, nursing staff documented that William's knee was warm to\nthe touch and that he was running a fever.  Blood tests indicated\na high white blood count.  The physician was not notified.  Three\ndays later, on March 20th, medical records document William's\ntemperature at 102 degrees and an elevated pulse rate of 125.\nThe nurse's notes indicate that William was \"flushed  ...\n- 10 -\n\ndehydrated.\"  Ke was cher. transferred to the hospital, still r.ot\nhaving seer, a D.C. Village physician.  William was diagnosed at\nthe hospital as suffering from celiulitis with drainage of\ninfected pus from the knee ar.d returned to D.C. Village.  Cr.\nAprii 4, 1955, William's progress notes states \"the ulcers are\ngetting worse.\"  Ke was not admitted again to the hospital until\nApril 13th, seme nine days later where his leg was amputated\nabove the knee due to necrosis and gangrene.\n23.  I personally observed William's current care and\ntreatment during my tour.  William currently suffers from two\nstage III/IV decubitus ulcers on his hip and buttock.  I found\nhim lying on an air mattress that was improperly inflated, thus\noffering no pressure relief.  The ulcer on his hip was oozing\ngreen pus.  In my opinion, this indicates that the wound is\nlikely to be infected.  The ulcer on his hip was a hole in the\nskin approximately 4 x6  centimeters in size.  The wound was red\nwith tissue coming through.  In my professional opinion, William\nis in imminent danger of infection due to the inadequate\nTreatment of the wound by D.C. Village staff.\n29.  Another example of the inadequate care being given is\nMoses D., who has had to have portions of both of his legs\namputated.  On October 17, 19 94, Moses underwent below-the-knee\namputation due to gangrene of the right foot.  His record\nindicates that on December 15, 1994, the attending physician\nnotes that \"the ulcers of the L  [left] leg not healing well.\"  On\nDecember 2Sth, thirteen days later, a progress note documents\n- 11 -\n~rr\n\nchat Moses still suffered from multiple leg ulcers and r.ecr::;:\ntissue.  The note identifies a moderate amount of drainage and\n' \"^^ C3Las  t ~ a ~ t )\"* -* ulcer is \"fou\"' s m-1 ^ l^ncr \"  *-• ^^~^• • ^ ~ ~^ — - —\nsurgical clinic was forwarded.  On January 3, 1995, the same\nphysician who examined Moses on December 15th, notes the\ndecubitus ulcers on his left leg and states that the patient has\na surgery clinic appointment.  On January 15, 1995, a month  after\nthe physician's note of improper healing, the monthly  nursing\nnote states  \"Leg ulcers doesn't  look good.  Consult  for the\nsurgical unit was sent.\"  It is not until January  24th that the\nrecord  indicates that Moses was seen in the surgical clinic and\nnot until February 7, 1995, almost two months after the severity\nof the problem was initially noted, that surgical  treatment at\nthe clinic was obtained.  A week later, en February 13, 1935,\nMoses was admitted to the hospital with gangrene and ulcers tf\nthe left  foot and leg.  The following day, February 14, 1995,\nMoses'  remaining  left leg was amputated  above-the-knee.\n30.  On May 30, 1995 I entered Moses' room to find him lyinc\nin his own urine and f eces.  Moses was lying ir.appropriatelv on\nan inverted egg crate donut which not only failed to provide any\npressure relief but, in fact, may serve to increases pressure in\nother decubiti prone areas.  Moses currently  suffers  from :v:\ndecubitus ulcers.  The wound by the base of his spine had an\nopening  that was approximately 4 x5  centimeters.  1 asked the\nnurse to probe the wound with an applicator tip so that I could\ngauge the size of the underlying wound.  It was evident that the\n- 12 -\n\nwound was quite deep as the nurse was able to place the rr:be\nthree inches into the wound.  The ulcerated area was duskv and\ndry due to the inappropriate dry dressing ordered by the\nphysician.  Such wounds need to be kept hydrated to increase\ncirculation.  In my opinion, Moses is at imminent risk, of\ninfection due to his inadequate treatment.\n31.  My review of Moses D.'s record also reveals that he has\na recently documented  (May 22n.d) penile ulceration due to the\nimproper use of a condom catheter by the nursing staff.\n32.  Marco W. is another resident at D.C. Village wh:\nrecently lest a limb after a long history of deteriorating\ndecubitus ulcers that became infected and gangrene.  While in\nMarco's case the deterioration was exacerbated by poor\ncirculation due to peripheral vascular disease, the inadequate\ncare and neglect by D.C. Village was a significant contributing\ni. a c •_ o r .\n33.  A review of the medical record of George A. who was\nhospitalized the day before our tour, May 23, 1995, is further\nreflective of the inadequate care at D.C. Village.  George .-.. was\nrehospitalized  (he had been hospitalized several times during the\npast year for infected multiple decubiti) with a fever and with a\nlisted diagnosis of multiple stage III and IV decubiti that were\nseptic and gangrene  (dead tissue due to lack of blood supply).\nMy review of George's medical record reveals that on May 13,\n1995, the nursing progress note stated \"AM reported to supervisor\n-- decubitus stage IV has no written orders for specific\n- 13 -\n\ntreatment.\"  It was not until May 17, 1995, four days later, chat\nthe record reflects that George was examined by a physician and\nspecific treatment ordered.  His decubicus ulcer was classified\nby che D.C. Village physician as \"deep to the muscle and bcr.e.\"\nThe physician referred George to the surgical clinic for\ndebridemenc  removal of dead skin) and reevaluation.  George was\nthen not seen by the surgical clinic physician until May 23,\n1995, another six days later.  Ke was immediately hospitalized\nwith a diagnosis that the hip area had become septic and\ngangrene.  He remained hospitalized during the time of my ccur.\n34.  My review of hospitalizations since January 1, 1995\nreveal numerous residents being hospitalized due to infecced\ndecubiti.  Examples include the hospitalizations of Willie V.\n(January 2, 19 95 - flap closure), Claude B.  (January 9, 19 9 5 -\nflap closure', , George A.  (February 16, 1995 - infected\ndecubitis), Houston J.  (February 17, 1995 - surgical flap, left\nhip), William S.  (March 19, 1995 - cellulitis, right knee), Marie\nD.  (March 24, 1995 - amputation, left leg), Milton B.  (March 30,\n1995 - celiulitis, right leg), William S. (April 13, 1995 -\nseptic right knee, subsequent amputation), James T.  (April 21,\n1995 - cellulitis), and George A.  (May 23, 1995 - multiple\ndecubitus ulcers, septic and gangrene).\n35.  My review of death records highlights the tragic\nconsequences of the inadequate care being rendered at D.C.\nVillage.  For example, during the past nine months, D.C. Village\nlists \"multiple decubitus ulcers\" as a cause of death for Willie\n- 14 -\n\n5.  (died or. August 20, 1994) , Savir.a C.  (died on September\n1534),  John 3.  (died on March 5, 1995) and Marie D.  (died en MaT\nay\n5, 1935) .\n3€.  Medical and nursing staff  throughout the faciiizv\nreport  shortages of essential medical  supplies normally use\n:o\ntreat  decubizus  ulcers.  In particular,  shortages of duoder\n'2na\nand 4x4 pads were continually  reported.  I personally  observeedd a\nmedical  doczcr  forced to do a debridement of dead skin tis=\nusing  improper equipment  (a suture  removal kit) because of\nof  adequate  supplies.  In addition,  this same doctor used =\nimproper oir.zment because he thought the facility still ha:\nshortage of zhe appropriate  Silvadine ointment. In sum, th^\nr* ^ •\nand  treatment of decubitus pressure ulcers at D.C. Village is\ninadequate and jeopardizes the health and well-being of\nr e s ** den~s\nInappropriate  Feeding and Medical  Care of D.C. Village  r.esidenzs\nPoses Life-Threatening  Risks\n37.  Many D.C. Village  residents  have eating disorders.\nFurther, many of these residents  have difficulty breathing and\nswallowing.  Improper  feeding techniques and inappropriate\npositioning of the residents during  feeding can cause acuze and\nchronic  aspiration problems in persons with these disorders.\nA.spiration of large amounts of food or liquid may result in\nasphyxiation; aspiration of smaller amounts will  compromise\nbreathing and lung functioning and chronically damage lung tissue\nthrough repeated or chronic infection.  Medically fragile\n- 15 -\n\nindividuals with weak respiratory systems, compressed chest\ncavities frcrr. scoliosis or poor positioning, and decreased r.uscle\ntone and lung capacity have greater difficulty coughing and\nclearing cheir lungs, conditions which contribute to both choking\nand gagging.  Repeated aspirations damage the lungs and car. lead\nto a spectrum of chronic respiratory problems, including asthr.a,\naspiration pneumonia, chronic lung disease and even sepsis, all\nof which can be fatal.\n33.  Turing my most recent investigation, I learned that\nD.C. Village residents continue to suffer from aspiration and\nchat several more aspiration-related deaths  (e.g. , Jessie '-.. ,\nElsie E., John B., Agnes S., John S., and Charles H.) had\noccurred since my last tour in June 1994.\n35.  These deaths are described in D.C. Village records as\neither directly related to aspiration or as a contributing cause\nof death.  It is my opinion that at least some of these deaths\nmay have been prevented if appropriate practices had been\nfollowed by trained staff.\n40.  Despite the fact that last year I had indicated a need\nto properly and adequately assess individuals at risk for\nswallowing problems, I saw little evidence that any such-\nevaluations had been conducted at D.C. Village.  Upon our arrival\nthis year, the facility was initiating its \"Dysphagia Clinic\" to\nassess residents with swallowing disorders including\nfeeding/aspiration issues.  However, it is important to note that\nthis clinic had not been commenced until May 25, 1995, the first\n- 15 -\n\nday of the -apartment of Justice's investigative tour and almos-\none year after we had toured in 1934.  During my investigation, I\nobserved a general failure to adequately monitor resider.-s during\nmeal times :: identify those with swallowing problems.\nMedical Diagnosis and the Management and Treatment of Residents\nwith Aspiration and P.elated Medical Problems are Inadequate\n41.  It is also my opinion that the medical diagnosis,\nmanagement, and treatment of aspiration and related medical\nproblems are inadequate and place the health of residents at C.C.\nVillage at risk.\n42.  The lack of appropriate identification of residents at\nrisk of aspiration and insufficient care thereafter is documented\nin individual charts.  Medical reviews are not conducted until\nche individual circumstances of residents become extreme.\n43.  P.elevant information regarding the identification, care\nana treatment of residents' feeding problems and related\ndisorders is not sufficiently communicated between the direct\ncare staff, therapists, nurses and doctors.  To the extent that\nsymptoms are observed at the direct care staff level, this\ninformation often does not appear to be communicated adequately\nto medical personnel or, if so, is often not translated by the\nphysicians into appropriate directions for assessment or\ntreatment.  In my review of residents' charts, I identified\ninstances where nursing and/or direct care progress notes report\nsymptoms of aspiration that are not discussed in physician notes\nand are not followed up with appropriate evaluation.  Similarly,\n- 17 -\n\nwhen appropriate occupational  therapy or dietary consults  are\nobtained,  there  is often  little indication of implementation  cf\nrecommended  interventions or follow-up by nursing or direct  care\nstaff .\n44.  2.Z.  Village's physicians also do not routinely  prcvide\nstandard medical assessment  and treatment  for residents ac  risk\nfor chronic  aspiration.  D.C. Village's medical and nursing  scarf\nare not  identifying and acting upon the clinical symotoms cf\nchronic  aspiration and related  illnesses.  Because staff are not\ncarrying out chis critical  function, illness, aspiration  and\ninjury are occurring which otherwise could be prevented  chrcugh\nearly detection and  intervention.\nDelayed Medical  Response\n45.  A review of death records revealed several cases cf\nrespiratory distress  in which nursing staff documented buz  failed\nto notify the physician, or where the physician  failed tc\npromptly respond until  the resident was in extreme  respiratory\nor c e a\n45.  An example  is the death record of Jessie K., who  died\non April  27, 1995.  The record reflects  failed/delayed\nnotification and appears to have been altered so as to indicate a\nquicker notification and response  time.  An initial note that day\nstates that Jessie  \"doesn't  look good.\"  The note looks  like it\nwas  initially written at 7:30  a.m. but was rewritten to  indicate\n8:30.  A second note at 8:45  reports that Jessie was  congested\nfull of mucus.  A third note, also appearing altered,  states\n- 18 -\n\n\"looks not :: [sic] good.\"  The note continues to state \"P.eccrted\n. . . (HN) that pt. congested i needed to be suction.\"  A 1C:ZZ\na.m. note indicates that Jessie was in distress and taken tt his\nroom.  C?R wa= commenced at l\":05.  Jessie was pronounced dead at\n10:2C that mcrning.  The failed and delayed notification in this\ninstance is a significant departure from professional standards.\nIf Jessie had been assessed promptly and adequately and then\ngiven proper treatment, he may have survived.\n47.  Ancth.er example is Agnes S. who died on February 2 3,\n1935.  On February 11, 1995, Agnes was hospitalized with an\nunexplained hand fracture and placed in a cast.  The next day,\nFebruary 12, 1395, the record reflects that the \"resident very-\ncongested and wheezing both lung sound congested  (sic) .\" Zr.\nFebruary 15th there is documentation of thick yellow mucus.\nLater that day, Agnes began to run a fever.  The next day,\nFebruary IS, 1995, the nurse's note indicates that Agnes\ncontinued to run a fever  (1C1.4) and states that Agnes \"is\nobserved to be coughing, having labored breathing, wheezing most\ntimes during the night.\"  Later that day, the physician was\nfinally notified and an x-ray taken.  At 12:45 p.m., Agnes was\nfinally examined by a physician and hospitalized with possible\npneumonia and sepsis.  Agnes died four days later on February 2G,\n1995.  The delayed notification is a significant departure from\nprofessional standards.  With earlier notification and proper\nintervention by the physician, this death could have been\nprevented.\n- 19 -\n\n43 .  I: conclusion, an overriding concern which e:\nhe f ir.dir.c :f inadequate medical care and treatment si\ns che inad: ruate assessments, evaluations and diagnose\no exist at: l.C  Village.  The result is that medical\n= and treatment are often inadequate and ir\n1 declare under penalty of perjury that the forego:\nD.

No. 95-943 TFI-I\n7KZ DISTRICT 07 COLUMBIA, et, al . ,\nDefendants.\nCUR-MET FOF.TZ\nPursuant co the provisions of 2S U.S.C. § 1745 and ~.D.C. R.\nI06(h), I, Curmet Forte, do hereby declare:\n1.  I have been a resident of the D.C. Village Nursing Home\n(\"DCV\") since 1986.  I presently live on Unit 3A.  I am alsz che\nPresidenc of che DCV Residents' Association.  In this job, I\nregularly tall-: to the other residents abou- things chat are\ncurrently affecting them at the facility.  I then talk, to the DCV\nadministrators, including the facility director, Ms. Brasfield,\nabouc the residents' concerns.  I try to get a solution for\nwhatever problem nay come up.\n2.  I appreciate the job Ms. Brasfield is trying to dc here\na: DCV.  She is responsive to my concerns and the concerns of the\nresidents' association.  Nonetheless, resident care and services\nhave suffered in recent months due to the District's budget\ncrisis.  Ms. Brasfield has told me that some DCV vendors haven't\nbeen paid.  This has created shortages of food, medical supplies\nand other things residents need.  Even though the city's budget\nproblems are not her fault, and even though she has done the best\n\nshe can, the financial crisis has caused real problems for\nresidents at the facility.\n3.  Ir. the past few months, there have been food shortages\nat all meals.  Once the outsiders arrived last week, cor.ditirr.s\nimproved and we had everything we needed.  We were fed chicken\nand pork chops and other good foods.  Before they arrived, the\nmeals were bad.  We were often served peanut butter sandwiches as\na meal.  The cooked food was usually net served to us hot.  There\nwere no lids to keep individual hot iterr.s warn.  Until the\noutside surveyors arrived, we had not received juice at lur.ch or\ndinner for a long tine.  Now that the outsiders are gone,\nconditions are worsening again.\n4.  We typically have to eat our r.eals with plastic\nutensils.  On nost occasions, we are not provided with plastic\nknives.  Needless to say, this makes eating difficult.\n5.  There have also been shortages of needed supplies and\nmedicine at DCV.  I've noticed that staff have run short of\nmedical supplies needed to treat residents on a daily basis such\nas gauze, four by fours, and duoderr. tape.  There has also been a\nshortage of cups here.\n6.  There have been recent hot water problems as well.\nIt's my understanding that the vendor who had been under contract\nto repair the plumbing had not been paid.  As a result, he\nstopped coning out to service the plumbing to ensure that we all\nhad adequate hot water.  Many units were without hot water for a\nweek.  The residents could not bathe or take showers.\n- 2 -\n\n7.  There are other sanitation problems here including\nroaches and -ice.  I've often heard mice running above ne ir. the\nceiling while I'm trying to go to sleep.  I've also heard them\nrunning down the heating pipe.  Roaches are often seen in\nresidents' rooms if there's food around.\n8.  Some contract nurses have been a problem at DCV.  They\npass medications with their hands dirty and they have committed a\nlot of medication errors.  Or, -any occasions, I've beer, har.ied\nthe wrong medication by a contract nurse, forcing me to correct\nher mistake.  They simply don't know the residents very veil.\n9.  I've often noticed nurses writing in the record that\nthey perform certain duties and yet I know they don't.  A let of\nresidents have gotten what I call a \"pencil bath\" where the\nnurses write in the record that they bathed the person, but in\nfact, they had not.  Many residents don't get turned in their\nbeds as they should.  I've also seen residents left wet for\nprolonged periods of time.  You can smell the urine.  I noticed\nthis just a few days ago.\n10.  The staff also sometimes become impatient with the\nresidents and holler at us.  This may result from the shortage of\nstaff I always notice on the units.  We're usually short-staffed\nall the time.  Some staff are forced to work two shifts in a row.\nThis makes them irritable.  These shortages continue today.\n11.  I've noticed that residents' clothes are often stolen\nwhen they are sent out to the laundry.  I don't even send my\nclothes to the laundry any more.\n- 3 -\n\n12.  I've recently noticed a problem with our personal needs\nfunds.  We are entitled to certain personal monies from Medicaid.\nThese funds are to be deposited directly into our own accounts.\nHowever, it sser.s that because of the budget crisis, the District\nis putting all our money into an account in the District's\nDepartment cf the Treasury.  They are supposed to give us the\nmoney we are entitled to from Medicaid directly, not keep it for\nthemselves ur.til we ask.  I've been able to get rr.y ir.cr.ey, but\nthat's because I can speak up for myself.  Other residents have\nrecently ccrr.e to me upset because they were told that their money\nwas tied up.  I approached Mr. Brown here at DCV and he agreed to\npay the residents who requested funds.  I still worry about those\nother residents who cannot speak about their concerns or come to\nme and ask for help.\n13.  I think the best way to resolve the problems here at\nDCV would be to place the operation of the facility under federal\ncontrol or under the control of a receiver.\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct.  Executed this  '••  day cf June, 1995.\n_ . / J  .-\n: \nCurmet  Forte\n- e. -\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nUNITED STATES Or AMERICA,  )\nPlaintiff,  )\nv.  )  Civ.

My curriculum vitae,\nwhich is attached to my Declaration, provides further details\nabout my experiences ana qualifications.\nBACKGROUND, EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION\n3.  Educational backaround:  I received my medical degree\nfrom New York Medical College in 1981.  I completed a medical\nTTT  r\n\ninternship at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York Citv.  Xv\nresidency was in psychiatry and I served a fellowship\nspecializing in geriatric psychiatry both at Mount Sinai S::.:;l\nof Medicine in New York.\n4.  Academic experience:  I am the Associate Chairman cf\nDepartment cf Psychiatry at the Long Island Jewish Medical\nCenter, and an Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry at\nthe Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.  I am s.l = c\nthe Program Director for one of the largest accredited felltv/shic\ntraininc prc~rams in geriatric psvchiatrv in the countr*.*.\n5.  Administrative and clinical experience:  Currentlv, I\nhold the positions of Director, Geriatric Psvchiatrv Divisitn,\nand Attending Psychiatrist for the Hillside Kospital-Lonr Island\nJewish Medical Center; Gero-Psychiatric Consultant for the Kecrev\nHome of the Acred (a 700-bed nursin— home) • ard Prc'sc\" ~ir—  r\nfor an affiliation between Long Island Jewish Medical Center and\nthe Central Islio Psychiatric Center, a chronic state hospital\nfor geriatric patients.  In these capacities, I am involved in\noverseemcr tne psychiatric care anc treatment j_or more tnan a\nthousand individuals, including a significant proportion who\nreside in a variety of long-term care facilities.\n6.  Professional Activities:  I am board certified in\npsychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.\nI have been granted the status of \"Diplomate\" by the National\nBoard of Medical Examiners and the American College of\nPhysicians.  The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology has\n- 2 -\n\nalso grar.ted me the status of \"Added Qualification in Geriatric\nPsychiatry.\"  I have also received awards for excellence ir.\npsychiatry, research ir. psychiatry and by the Northwest Brcnx\ncouncil on Aging, the Outstanding Gerontologist Award.  In\naddition, I recently received a clinical mental health academic\naward in geriatric psychiatry from the National Institute of\nMental Health  (\"NIMH\").\nI am an active member of the American Psychiatric\nAssociation  (\"APA\") and serve on the APA's Council on Aging's\nCommittee or. Access Effectiveness of Psychiatric Services fcr the\nElderly.  I am also a member of the American Association for\nGeriatric Psychiatry and the Gerontological Societv of America,\nand have made numerous presentations before these groups en\nissues related to geriatric psychiatry.\nT  ^\"'bl~'cat\"'on3t  I nave published sxt£nsivs'* v o ^ ^\nvariety of topics in the field of geriatric psychiatry, including\narticles, book chapters, monographs, and abstracts in respected\nprofessional journals.  P.ecent publications and presentations\ninclude: Geriatric Depression With and Without Reversible\nCognitive Impairment: Clinical Comparison; Psvchotrooics and\nHispanic Nursing Home Residents; Impact Of A Nursing Home\nGeriatric Psvchooharmacoloav Education Program On Prescribing\nPractices; and Tailoring Adult Psychiatric Practices To The Field\nOf Geriatrics.  In addition, I have been an invited speaker at\nnumerous symposiums, grand rounds and annual meetings of medical\n- 3 -\n\nassociations.  Many of my publications ana presentations have\nfocus^d on 1 cnc term care and treatment\nS .  Excert Witness activities ana experience in Ion- term\ncare related litigation:  I have served as an expert consultant\nin cases ir.vdving professional standards for geriatric\npsychiatry.  I have worked with the United States Department of\nJustice since 1993 in the Department's investigation and\nenforcement activities under the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Ace  (\"CRIPA\").  In this capacity, I\nhave been involved with CRIPA investigations in Virginia and -he\ninstant action here in the District of Columbia.\nINVOLVEMENT WITH THIS CASE AND FAMILIARITY WITH D.C. VILLAGE\nNURSING HOME\n9.  In April 1994, I was asked by the Department of Justice\nto serve as an expert consultant to assess the psychiacric care\nand treatment of residents at the D.C. Village Nursing Home in\nWashington, 2.C.  I first toured D.C. Village on June c-7, 1594.\nPrior to the tour, I reviewed numerous documents provided by\nD.C. Village, including policies and procedures of the facility,\ninternal reports and summaries, consultations and treatment\nprotocols.  During the investigative tour, I observed, among\nother things, routine medical and psychiatric care and treatment\nof residents within their living units.  In addition, resident\ncharts were reviewed and multiple staff members interviewed.\n10.  I toured D.C. Village again on Tuesday, May 30, IS35.\nAgain, I observed the routine medical and psychiatric care and\nTT\n\ntreatment of residents and spoke with multiple staff tr.err.bers .\nDuring the tcur, I reviewed more documents, including additional\nindividual resident medical records.\n11.  During the more recent investigative tour last week, I\nsaw that the deficiencies I had identified last year had .-.:: bee:\ncorrected by the District, and that D.C. Village residents rerr.ai:\nat serious risk of harm.  In my opinion, D.C. Village is failing\nto provide residents with adequate and appropriate psychiatric\ncare and mental health services in accordance with accepted\nShortages at D.C. Village Have Led to Inadequate Basis Care\n12.  Before I address psychiatry issues, there are severs.!\nareas of more general but immediate concern that I noted during\nthe recent investigative tour.  Multiple staff I talked with\nreported that there were staff shortages, particularly among\nnurses and nurse's aides and that there were supply shortages.\nSome staff commented that the consequences of these shortages\nincluded: \"not enough nurse's aides to feed peoole;\" \"not enough\nnurse's aides to bathe people,-\" that the requirements of tube\nfeedings, nebulizer treatments, and medication administration\noverwhelmed the nursing manpower and \"there's gotta be mistakes;\n\"inadequate food on trays;\" and \"medication shortages.\"  In\naddition, several physicians told me in confidence that because\nof medication and staff shortages, they believed nursing staff\nwould either mark in the record that the drug had been giver.,\neven if it had not been given, or indicate that the resident\n- 5 -\n\nrefused the dedication.  The physicians further indicated zheir\nbelief thai lew drug blood levels are a consequence of\nmedications :.:; being given because of either medication\nshortages or lack of nursing manpower.\nInadequate rsvehiatric Assessment of D.C. Village Residents\n13.  The principles underlying modern psychiatric care are\nsympzom-based diagnosis and diagnosis-based treatment.  These\nbasic premises are undermined regularly at D.C. Village.  In both\ndiscussions wi~h staff and review of medical records, I found\nlittle documentary evidence that residents are adequately\ndiagnosed via the traditional organized process of  (a) collecting\nhistorical information,  (b) interviewing the resident and\nsignificant others,  (c) conducting a. comprehensive mental status\nexami1^a^iC'\"  including a cocrnxtive examz.n3.tion (esoecia\"' lv i~\" \"he\nelderly or in those individuals with underlying brain disease;,\n(d) colleccin- additional necessarv coroiiarv information, (e.c.,\nneurological examination, blood tests, neuroimaging scans,\nneuropsychological testing), and  (e) integrating these data into\na diagnostic formulation and/or differential diagnosis that\nconforms with the generally accepted standard diagnostic\nnomenclature cf American psychiatry as articulated in the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual  (\"DSM-IV\") published by the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.\n14.  D.C. Village is not providing its residents with a\ncomprehensive psychiatric assessment including adequate\nbehavioral data and analysis where appropriate.  The notion that\n\na potentially reversible medical or neurological problem r.;r'r.: be\nexpressed as a behavioral disturbance seems alien.\n15.  D.C. Village also appears to conduct no cognitive\nexaminations or dementia work-ups of its residents.  I found\nlittle evidence that mentally ill residents are provided with an\nintegrated differential diagnosis and treatment plan signed zy\nthe psychiatrist.\n16.  It is generally accepted in the field that a proper\nDSM-IV diagnosis be formulated and recorded as part of the\nprocess of institutionalized residents receiving psychotrorio\nmedication.  However, the D.C. Village medical staff is net\nfamiliar with and does not appropriately employ the DSM-IV\ncriteria or terminology in formulating psychiatric diagnoses.\nFurthermore, reevaluation and revision of psychiatric diagnoses\ndo not aooear to occur ir. any regular or organize^, manner.\nPsychiatric Treatment at D.C. Village is Inadequate\n17.  It is generally accepted that psychiatric treatment\nshould be an amalgam of psychosocial, psychopharmacolcgical, and\npsychiatric rehabilitative efforts that are organized into a\ncoherent, multidisciplinary  \"treatment plan\" that is regularly\nrevisited to determine whether such treatment has been effective\nin ameliorating the psychiatric symptomology and disorders.\n18.  I found little evidence that such a process occurs at\nD.C. Village.  There is no effort made to integrate psychiatric\ncare for the residents in a nuiltidisciplinary fashion.\nFurthermore, psychiatric notes are not integrated into the\n- 7 -\nTWI  1  W\n\nindividual's overall medical plan of care or with behavioral\ntreatment programs.  I could not find a single integrated\n~edical/psychiatric/psychosocial  plan in any D.C. Village\nresident's chart that I reviewed.\n19.  In addition, I found no organized use of psychctrceic\nmedication in a carefully considered plan of care.  For examele,\nfor residents on antipsychotic medications, forms seem tc have\nsupplanted the traditional psychiatric note that incorporates the\nvarious aspects of symptoms, treatment, side effects, and ether\ninformation  (e.g., nursing notes/input), and ends with a\nconciusion/ir.pressions and a carefully considered plan.\n20. I found no consistent correlation between medicatien\norder changes and progress note documentation of such changes.\nIn face, there is no rationale provided when medication dosages\nare changed.  Furthermore, examples of inaccuracies are apparent\nin psychiatric notes: e.g., a resident is titrated down and off\nof a particular neuroieptic and the psychiatric note indicates\nthat neuroieptics have been discontinued and are not indicated,\nwhile in fact, the resident actually continues to receive another\nneuroieptic medication.\n21.  Psychotropic medications are often used incorrectly at\nD.C. Village.  For example, I found medication dosing does net\nalways conform to geropsychiatric standards, and the dosing of\nantidepressants to be inadequate and/or not properly titrated.\n22.  There are also many individuals with the medication\nside effect of tardive dyskinesia (\"TD\") living at D.C. Village.\n- 8 -\n\nTD is an untoward, usually irreversible effect, appearing after\nlong term use of antipsychocic drugs, involving involuntarv\nmuscle involvement, spasms, and speech disturbances.  Yet, I\nfound evidence that antichoiinergic/dopaminergic  medications\n(medications given to control/influence nervous system activity)\nbeing improperly prescribed for TD, even though these agent-\nwill, in fact, worsen TD.  The D.C. Village physicians are\nconfusing 71 and extrapyramidai symptoms.  This indicates a lack\nof basic neuro-chemical/neurc-pharmacoiogical  understanding among\nmedical providers at D.C. Village and highlights the need f:r\ninservice training in psychopharmacoiogy and geriatric\npsychopharmacoiogy.\n23.  Fsychopharmacclogical treatment does not appear tc be\nclearly tied tc target symptoms, i.e., if the target symptoms are\nnot improved, the treatment should then be modified  (dosage\nincreased, decreased, or drug changed).  Side effect monitoring\nis erratic and potentially dangerous  (e.c., not monitoring\npostural bleed pressure in elderly residents on psychotropic\ndrugs that can provoke postural hypotension and consequent\nfalls).  In addition, there currently is no regular review of\nprescribed psychotropic medications to integrate side effects\nwith symptoms.  The side effects testing that I observed in the\nrecords appeared to be perfunctory and did not in several cases\ncorrelate with my personal observations of residents.\n24.  Psychosocial and psychiatric rehabilitative treatments\ndo not exist for the majority of the patients and are not part of\n- 9 -\n\nan integrated treatment plan that has defined goals and\ncbjectives.\n25.  Ir. su~, in my opinion, D.C. Village is failing :c\nprovide residents with adequate and appropriate psychiatric care\nand mental health services in accordance with accepted\nprofessional standards to residents who are in need of such\nservices.\nInappropriate Placement of D.C. Village Residents With Mental\nIllness\n25. It is my opinion that -any of the residents at T.C.\nVillage with a psychiatric diagnosis are inappropriately placed\nand need not be in a nursing home setting.\n27.  Several staff commented to me that D.C. Village has\nbeen a \"dumping ground\" for Saint Elizabeth's overflow of\nschizophrenic patients.  I was informed by a D.C. Village\nphysician that \"plenty of people are here who should not be\nhere. \"\n28.  It is generally accepted that individuals with a\nprimary psychiatric diagnosis should not be placed in a nursing\nhome setting.  One physician reported to me that the prior 2.Z.\nVillage Medical Director explicitly instructed staff to \"net list\npsychiatric illness as the primary diagnosis.\"  If true, this is\na dramatic departure from generally accepted professional\nstandards.\n29.  My own review of medical charts suggests that the\nmedical needs of many of the D.C. Village residents\n- 10 -\n\nclassified wi:h a secondary diagnosis of mental illness do :.;;,\nir. face, necessitate placement in a nursing home.\n30.  .-.\" a minimum, everyone with a psychiatric diagnosis at\nD.C. Village should be re-evaluated, and for those who are\ndetermined to have a primary psychiatric diagnosis, they shculd\nbe outplaced to a more appropriate setting.  I found the process\nof complying with federal statutory nursing home regulations a:\nadmissions and a lack of review/outplacement of inappropriate\nresidents.  These regulations are part of the Nursing Home Reform\nLaw (\"QBRA legislation\") and include a Pre-Admission Screening\nand Annual Resident Review  (\"PA3ARR\") for mental illness.\n31.  In addition, even if residents with orimarv osvehiazric\ndiagnoses are considered to have secondary psychiatric diagnoses\nwith medical or dementia qualifiers for nursing home placemen\",\nD.C. Village is still obligated, pursuant to federal nursing home\nlaw and generally accepted professional standards, to provide\nadeauate osychiatric services.  I find that D.C. Village fails to\nprovide such services.  For example, when I queried the D.C.\nVillage psychiatrist about a work-up to rule out whether a\nresident with dementia may have a reversible component to their\ncognitive decline, he replied, \"We don't do a dementia work-up.\"\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing\nis true and accurate.

When I visited rr.y great-grandmother at DC\" in August\n1993, I was shocked at the conditions there.  The roocr.s smelled\nlike urine.  There were no staff around as far as 1 could see.\nEvery resident on the unit was herded in front of the TV wi\"h no\nstaff present.  There were no scheduled activities.  S'r.e va =\ndressed in a hospital gown, not real clothes.  In fact, there\nwere no clothes in her closet or in her furniture.  All of her\nclothes were r.issing.\n3.  I a\" a certified therapeutic recreation specialist, so\nI'm familiar with elderly patients' therapy needs.  When I looked\nthrough my great-grandmother's record, I was surprised to\nTil\n\ndiscover that she had been given no therapy whatsoever at DCV.\nThere was no current therapy plan of care in her chart with goals\nand objectives, and there was no indication in the chart I\nreviewed thac therapy or stimulation had been provided to her at\nall.  She was just left ir. bed all day.  In fact, when I visited\nDCV, no one cane in to provide any forn of service for or therapy\nto her.\n4.  Wher. I called up the relevant professional at DCV to\nask why such needed services were not being furnished, I was\ngiven a harsh, abrupt and arrogant response.  It was completely\nunprofessional.  He made it seem as if I was at fault somehow for\nmerely inquiring about my relative's health and welfare.  I also\nspoke with r.y great-grandmother's physician at DCV, and he blar.sd\nconditions on the budget and the agency nurses -- anyone else but\nhim.\n5.  My great-grandncther died of a fractured skull.  At the\nhospital, the doctors believed that she must have been dropped to\nhave sustained this type of injury.  They didn't see how an\nelderly person with severe contractures in her upper and lover\nlimbs could have sustained such a traumatic fracture.\n6.  Even though this was a serious injury and eventually\nled to her death, DCV had failed to fill out an incident report\non the matter within 2 4 hours.  Only when I brought this to their\nattention did they take steps to have the matter investigated.\nEven then, no one could really pinpoint exactly what happened to\n- 2 -\nTWIT\n\nher.

P..\n106(h), I, Andrew Hawkins, do hereby declare:\n1.  I am the brother of Charles Hawkins, who was a residenc\nat D.C. Village  (\"DCV\") for about two years before his death on\nJanuary 3, 15 55.\n2.  A few years ago, at age 59, my brother suffered brain\ndarr.a.cj'e thai causeci him to recruire specialized attention an— ca-3.\nMy brother had lived with rr.e and my wife for a few years, buo he\nneeded more services than we were able to provide for hirr.. Vie\ndecided to clace hin at DCV.  I visited hi^ as ofuen as I could.\nSometimes I would see hir. twice a week; other times I would see\nhim three or four times a rr.cnth.\n1 3.  Every time I visited my brother at DCV, I became upset\nover the deplorable conditions.  The longer I stayed, the more it\ngot to me.  I found myself needing to leave earlier than I had\nplanned, because if I didn't, I would have confronted people and\ngotten myself in trouble.  Yet, I found that talking to staff was\n\nalways a useless exercise.  I couldn't trust anyone there-\nall banded together to tell r.e half-truths.\n4. I' - overcome with guilt sometimes because I left r.y\nbrother there and he ended up dying.  It's been very difficult\nfor me to 1ive with.  I wish the place could be shut down s: that\nno one else will have to suffer like ny brother did.  I'm afraid\nalot of other people will die needlessly.  It's a national\ndisgrace.\n5.  While he was alive, the DCV staff did not take care of\nmy brother adequately; they didn'r provide for his basic care\nneeds.  It was a crime the way they treated him.  They just\nignored him.  They would leave hin and the other residents in\nfront of the TV unattended.  The staff were very unprofessional;\nin fact, they were a disgrace to their profession.  Whenever I\nvisited hir., I found him needing a shave and needing to be\ncleaned up.  I couldn't even find staff to help me take care cf\nhim when I visited.  I would have to find my own razor ar.3 shave\nhim myself.  I would also do my best to clean him up myself.  I\nnever saw staff around to help.  I think this was outrageous\n_ neglect.\n6.  I was always surprised to find that my brother had been\nleft poorly dressed in clothes that were three sizes too lares\nfor hin.  None of the clothes he wore were ever his.  Thay\nweren't really clothes, they were more like rags.  That never\nmade sense to me because I made sure that my brother had enough\nto wear when I first left him at DCV.  In fact, he had quite an\n- 2 -\n\nextensive wardrobe.  But it seer.s that whenever my brother's\nclothes were sent to the laundry, certain items would becor.s lost\nforever.  I could never find any clothes in his closet or in his\ndrawers.  As a result, he v/as always dressed like a raganuf t in.\nIt was just criminal.\n7.  I think rcy brother's death was suspicious and\nmysterious.  He died after having choked on a very large piece of\nmeat.  He had never had any eating problems or choking episodes\nin the past.  I think the r.sat may have been forced down his\nthroat, but I can't prove it.  In telling rce about his dea-h, the\nhospital doctors looked at themselves as if something was grossly\nwrong.  When I talked to staff at DCV about the circumstances\nsurrounding his death, they all looked scared to death.  No one\nwould talk to me about it.\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct.

R.\n105(h),  I, Maria  Laurence, do hereby  declare:\n1.  I am. the Supervisor of Volunteer Advocacy  Services at\nthe  District  of Columbia Arc, Inc. (\"DC Arc\").  As part of our\nmany  duties and responsibilities, DC Arc serves as the court-\nappointed  Menicor  for the class of approximately  S3 j individuals\nwith  developmental  disabilities  known as the Pratt  class, whe\nhave  been out-placed  into the community  from Forest  Haver., a\nDistrict-run  institution  that was forced to close  under  court\norder in 1351. We routinely visit  the class members at  their\n.residences and day programs to ensure  that  they are provided  with\nadequate  habilitaticn,  care and other  support  services  to m.eet\ntheir  needs  pursuant  to a series of consent  decree  provisions\nthat  govern  their  outplacement.\n2.  Upon the closure of Forest  Kaven, 23 individuals  with\nmental  retardation  were placed at D.C. Village  (\"DCV\").  At the\ntime, DC Arc voiced  opposition to these placements  because we\nconsidered DCV to be an inappropriate  institutional  setting  that\n\nwas overly restrictive and that would fail to meet the needs of\nthe class -er.bers.  In fact, the class members have not fared\nwell at DCV.  Of the 2 3 class members who were initially placed\nthere in 19 9 0-91, 10 have since died.  Many class members' health\ndeteriorated rapidly and they died shortly after placement a~\nDCV.  For example, Rsnee W., Anna Hay H., and Linda T. all died\nwithin two months of placement at DCV; Russell S. died within\nfive months of placement; Willie P.. died within nine months of\nplacement; Donna C. died within thirteen months of placemenz; and\nMaxwell E. died fourteen months after placement, at DCV.  Other\nclass members, Joseph M., Deborah K. and Earl V., also have died\nwhile under the care cf DCV.\n3.  In order to monitor conditions and services provided to\nthe remaining class members at DCV, I have visited the facility\non many different occasions over the years.  In 1995, I have\nvisited DCV about once or twice a month.\n4.  I have noticed that in response to cited problems and\npressure from DC Arc and other outside groups, DCV has put a lot\nof new processes in place.  However, during my visits, I have not\nfound that these new processes resulted in significant\nimprovements for the residents.  The facility director, Ms.\nBrasfield, and the District administrators seem to have good\nintentions, but their initiatives, like total quality management\nand peer review, seem to have had little real impact on resident\ncare and services.  For example, in several recent conversations\nwith DCV staff, in meetings and on the residential units, the\n- 2 -\n\nstaff have indicated that certain activities related to the care\nof the class members and of the other residents do not occur in\nthe manner they are supposed to because of a lack of necessary\nequipment, s:affing or training.\n§.  Generally, my observations at DCV have led me tc\nconclude that there are not an adequate number of staff to meet\nthe needs of the class members and of the other residents,\nespecially  individuals with mental retardation.  The staff often\ndo not interact appropriately -with the residents.  For exar.ple,\nin April of this year, I stood in a dayroom on Unit 5A for about\nthirty minutes.  Nine residents were present, but no staff were\nin the room.  After a few minutes, two staff then entered the\nroom and began talking to and tending to the needs of some of the\npeople.  On several occasions, I have observed the staff sitting\nin the dayroom at a table talking to one another with class\nmembers and other persons sitting idle while the TV is on in the\nbackground.  I have never seen a supervisor tell the staff that\nthis type of behavior is unacceptable.  As a result, there is a\ntotal lack of habilitation provided to the class members and\nresidents who need it.  At times, when I have identified r.yself\nas being f ror; the Monitoring program, staff have increased their\ninteraction with the class members and the other residents.  The\nresidents are usually all lined up in their wheelchairs in the\ndayroom or they are in bed and receive minimal interaction from\nthe DCV staff.\n-i  _\n\n6.  It appears that the food served to the people living at\nDCV is a concern.  While I observed a r.eal a few weeks ago, I\nheard one staff member comment on the poor quality of the food,\nsaying to the individual she was feeding, \"I 'in surprised you can\neat it, it's so hard.\"\n7.  While reviewing resident charts a few months ago, I\nnoticed that DCV did not have a sufficient supply of Jevity, a\nliquid nutrient used for tu! ings, for one of the class\nmembers, Franklin M.  In the chart, the nutritionist wrote ~hat\nthe food could not be given \"because of unavailability.\"  Jevity\nhad been carefully selected by a DCV physician as the food that\nbest ir.et Franklin/s individual nutritional needs.  In fact, the\ndoctor wrote a prescription for the Jevity.  Because the Jevity\nwas not available, the facility was forced to substitute it with\nComplent, a liquid food wizh a different nutritional value.\n8.  When I observe p.eais, I usually notice that the DCV\nstaff do not follow the written feeding protocols specifically\ntailored for the residents.  As a result, the staff often feed\nthe residents incorrectly.  This is dangerous because many of\nthese individuals have swallowing problems or other medical\nconcerns requiring careful feeding.\n9.  At a recent neal, I found that a shortage of staff led\nto long delays in feeding certain residents.  While the\nindividuals who live at DCV waited, the staff left the trays of\nfood uncovered so that the food became cold by the time it was\nfed to the residents.  As a result, the residents became clearly\n\nuncomfortable.  The individuals with mental retardation resorted\nto crying and whining to get the attention of the staff.\n10.  Certain individuals with mental retardation require\nclose supervision.  However, whenever I visit DCV, I invariably\nnotice staff rot doing anything to intervene when a person with\nmental retardation begins to engage in inappropriate behaviors.\nJust last north, I noticed that Arnethia R., a resident with\nmental retardation, had become agitated.  DCV has provided her\nwith virtually no meaningful activity in which to be involved.\nTypically, she ends up playing with tin cans by herself.  In\naddition, the poor staff ratio usually leaves her confined to the\ndayroom where the few staff on duty can keep an eye on her.\nArnethia seer.s to enjoy being active.  On this particular cay,\nshe was walking out into the hallway trying to leave the dayroom.\nInitially, in response to her agitation, staff yelled at her but\ndid not r.ove away frorr. their table to intervene.  Eventuailv,\nthey F.oved to physically stop her.  In response, Arnethia\nresorted to sitting on the floor, rocking back and forth,  j\nflapping her hands and banging her hands on the floor.\nEventually, she even approached me and tried to get me to escort\nher off the unit.  It was clear the DCV staff did not know what\nto do.  They definitely did not refer to Arnethia's behavior\nprogram to determine what they should do.  Fortunately, a\nGeorgetown University staff person who is contracted to provide\nclinical services to persons with mental retardation, came by and\nintervened by implementing her behavior management program.  The\n- 5 -  :\nWit\n\nresidents with mental retardation are fortunate that the\nindependent contractors from Georgetown are there to intervene\nappropriately whenever they can.  When intervention is left to\nthe DCV staff alone, the residents have suffered.\n11.  Generally, program plans are not implemented by DCV\nstaff.  For example, instead of following the behavior plar. for\nCynthia W., a resident with mental retardation who excessively\nrubs her ear until it becomes raw, staff will apply restraint\nmitts instead.  According to her Individual Habilitation Plan\n(\"IK?\"), Carla L., a resident with nental retardation, is to\nreceive training to use a soft glove to wash herself.  However,\nthe Georgetown staff have told ir.e that this has never happened.\nGenerally, DCV staff have not demonstrated knowledge of the\nresidents' IK?'s to properly implement them.  In fact, it is\nnever clear to me that the residents' IHP's are even kept on the\ngiven living units.  This makes implementing the written plans\nvery difficult.\n12.  In response to repeated concerns expressed by DC Arc,\nthe Long Term Care Ombudsman, and the U.S. Department of Justice,\nthe District has recently begun taking steps to place in the\ncommunity ail remaining class members and any other  individuals\nwith mental retardation who currently reside at DCV.  We applaud\nthis decision because DCV is and will remain an inappropriate\ninstitutional setting for individuals with mental retardation.\nWe have been working closely with facility administrators and the\ndesignated community vendors to ensure that the placements are\n-  6  -  •  .  '\nTl!\n\nappropriate and will meet the specialized needs of these\nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  Outplacement\nefforts should continue and new admissions to DCV of people vith\nmental retardation should be prohibited.  ,:\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct.

E.\n105(h), I, Maria Laurence, do hereby declare:\n1.  Since signing rr.y previous declaration, I visited Z.Z.\nVillage  (\"DCV\"} on two separate occasions, Monday, June 12, 19 95\nand Friday, June IS, 1995.  This supplemental declaration details\nobservations  I m.ade on these two visits.\n2.  Or. each day, there wss no adapti*/e equipment available\nat mealtimes for the use of residents who need it.  No staff\nseemed to knew where it was.  The unit staff called the kitchen\nto look for it, but they could not find it either.  For som.e\nindividuals with severe disabilities, adaptive equipment is\ncritical to allow them to feed themselves, or to be fed safely\nand effectively.  When it is not available, these individuals\nstruggle and often are ur.able to take in sufficient amounts of\nfood to meet their nutritional needs.\n3.  Because of the lack of the adaptive scoop plate she\nneeds, I noticed that Shirley A. was unable to feed herself\nproperly.  As a result, food was flying off the plate onto her\n'• •'!\n\nbench.  I noticed her eating the fallen food off the bench,\nstaff intervened to help her.\n4.  I observed Patricia A. eat only about one tench o\nr.eal on Mor.dav because the adaptive cuo and other\nadaptive\nequipment s'r.e needs was not available.  I asked the Geor-e:\ncontract staff about her.  I learned that Patricia has lest\npounds, which places her below her ideal body weight.  I\nunderstand -hat her dramatic weight loss is attributable di\nto the lack of proper feeding equipment at DCV.\n5,  A= a result, tracking Patricia's weight is exceed\nimportant to her health and well-being.  However, in an\ninterdisciplinary team meeting for Patricia on June 16, 19r\nDCV nurse indicated that Patricia could not be weighed prep\nat DCV because the unit scale was broken.  The nurse admit\"\nthat the vendor who normally comes out no repair the scale\nnot come out to DCV because he had not been paid past due a\n-ount\nfor ssrvices he had rendsred.\n6.  On Monday, while observing activity in the dayrccm on\nunit 5A, I observed a large puddle of liquid on the floor bv DCV\nresident Franklin M.  It turned out to be a cuddle of Jevicy, the\nliquid nutrient provided to Franklin through a feeding tube.  The\nJevity was spilling on the floor because Franklin's tube had\nbecome dislodged.  I immediately notified staff who then\nreconnected the tube without sterilizing it.  Throughout my 45\nminute stay in the dayroom, no staff had interacted with cr\nchecked on Franklin.  Had I not been present, noticed the puddie,\n- 2 -\nTTBT\n\nand alerted the staff, Franklin may have continued to si- wi~h\nhis feeding tube disconnected and leaking for a much longer t irr.e.\nI learned later that Franklin has suffered with many different\ninfections at his tube site.  My understanding is that this could\nbe due to the fact that his tube repeatedly becomes dislodged,\nand yet the staff reconnects it without sterilizing it fir=:.\n7.  On Fridav, I observed Pierce L., a DCV resident,\nHe started coucrh.in.cj and soittir.cr up mucus.  I immediat~lv £.l~rted.\nthe staff in the dayroom who alerted the registered nurse.  She\nintervened by stopping the flow into Pierce's feeding tube.\nFierce's condition seemed to improve, however, it was clear that\nthe nursir.cr staff had not been r.onitorin-cr his condition closely\nenough to prevent him from suffering such discomfort.\n8.  I have recently learned that for a variety of reasons,\nthe District will not r.esc its stated goal of cutplacing into the\ncommunity ail DCV residents with mental retardation by June 3C,\n19S5.

Massenheimer, do hereby declare:\nX.  I am the President of National Nurses Service\n(\"National\";, a division of ATLIS Health Services, Inc.  National\nprovides nurses on a part-time contractual basis for hospitals,\nnursing horr.es, and private individuals.\n2.  For about the last four or five years, National has\nfurnished -he D.C. Village Nursing Home (\"DCV\") with agency\nnurses pursuant to a contractual arrangement with the District cf\nColumbia.\n3.  Until recently, our arrangement with the District had\nbeen a positive one.  Although payments were often delaved, the\nDistrict eventually paid us for the services we had rendered at\nDCV.  However, last Fall, we stopped receiving payment altogether\nfor our contract nursing services.  As a result, we were forced\nto call repeatedly various District officials in an atter.pt to\nobtain the funds we were due.  Many times, our phonecalls were\nnot returned.  Whenever we were finally successful in talking to\n\nsomeone, we were often asy.ed to re-fax the invoices we had\nalready submitted causing further delay.  In response to our\npleas, the District made numerous promises and assurances to us\nthat we would be paid in a week or ten days, yet we never\nreceived pay—ent.\n4.  In March or April 1995, we finally received partial\npayment for -he months of October, November and December 19 9 4.\nAs is obvious, this payment was long overdue.  We are still owed\nmoney for services we've rendered at DCV for the months of\nJanuary through Hay 1995.\n5.  On May 23, 1995, I sent the attached letter to Vernon\nHawkins, the Interim Director of the District's Department of\nHuman Services  (\"DKS\"), expressing my extreme concern about the\noverdue amounts owed us totalling $134,964.56.  As I indicated in\nthe letter, some of the invoices dated back seven months.  I\nalerted Mr. Hawkins that we would be forced to discontinue\nservice to DCV if we were not paid.\n6.  On June 6, 1935, I sent another letter to Mr. Hawkins\nadvising him that we still had not received payment for services\nrendered at DCV.  I told him that we would be unable to continue\nservice at DCV after the evening of June 9, 1995 unless we\nreceived payment for the past due amounts.  I have also attached\na partial list of overdue amounts stemming from work performed at\nDCV primarily in March, April and May 1995.  Some of the overdue\namounts involve invoices submitted as far back as October 1994.\n- 2 -\n\n7.  Since February of this year, we have been providing\nservices to DCV in good faith based upon the professional and\nofficial representations of Mr. Hawkins, who expressly told ny\norganization and other DCV providers that our contracts were\nbeing verbally extended by the District.  He asked us to work\nwith the District daring its fiscal crisis.  We agreed to do so,\nbut we have reached the point now where we cannot continue to\nprovide service en the representations of the District alone,\nwhich in the past have proven empty.\nI certify under penalty c: perjury that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct.

In the beginning, we v/ere used spcradically, however,\nfrora October 1993 through February 1S95, we laundered DCV iterr.s\non a somewhat regular basis.  The last service we provided DCV\nwas in late February 1995.\n4.  The individuals at DCV have always been pleased vith\nour work.  Mike Pantazis of DCV wrote us a few months ace\nindicating that we provided a \"quality linen service  ...

Currently, the District cv/ss Nutech $90,827.se  for\nservices rendered at CCV.  As the attached invoice anali sis\nreport reveals, we are still cued monies for services v;e provided\nat DCV as far back as May 1994.\n7-  In trying to obtain the monies Nutech is due, v.e have\nbeer, forced to speaX with many different District officials.\nWorking vith the D.C.

They wait until\ntheir nachines, or the machines at St. Elisabeth's hospital,\nbreak down before contacting us.  Naturally, the cost fcr\nemergency work is higher than it would fce if we had a\nrelationship established where there was sortie semblance cf\ncontinuity in service.  We hare tried repeatedly to tell District\nofficials that they are wasting their resources by procuring\nlaundry services in this manner.  However, we have been unable to\nsucceed in creating a nore orderly and reliable working\n\nrelationship with the District.  Without better planning and\nforesight, the District will continue to obtain emergency\nservices vay over market prices whether froai Hutech or froir. s:ne\nother vender.

Specifically, we provide nattress overlay systems which.\nmitigate the formation of bed sores and aid in their he-ii.ing.\nThis is accomplished by a series of bubble tubes in whir;h air is\npumped through the nattress overlay.  NPCS provides not only the\nmattress overlays but also the support staff to service -:he\nequipment and to inservice the consumers and their care ijivers on\nhow to use the product most effectively.\n\n13:29  ©202 514 6273  CRT SPEC LIT  $004\n3.  Since the Spring of 1934, NPCS has had a formal\narrangement with the District of Columbia tc provide the services\ndescribed above at the D-C. Village Nursing Hone (\"DCV\").  We\nhave provided mattress overlay systems and support to DCV for a\nnunber of residents on an as-needed basis.  We charge tire\nDistrict twenty-five dollars per day per unit for our ssstezis and\nservice.  :\n.A.  As of May 31, 1995, the District owes NPCS $66,535.00\nin past dus amounts for goods and services supplied tc iCV.  We\nhave not received any payment at all for services rendered sines\nOctober 1994.  The last check ws received from the District\narrived to us in December 1394 for services rendered at L'CV in\nSeptember 1994.\n5,  We have made repeated telephone calls to Ks. ;..'berta\nBrasfield, the DCV facility director, and to Mr. Silas m.tler,\nalso of DCV, in an attempt to obtain payrtent.  We are a..vays\npromised payment, but it never arrives.\n6.  Despite the non-payment, NPCS has continued to honor\nits agreement with the District because we believe it i-.s against\npublic policy to stop service to the medically fragile ucv\nresidents who are using our products.

R.\n106(h), I, Lamont Royster, do hereby declare:\n1.  I have been a resident of the D.C. Village Nursing Horr.e\n(\"DCV\") for the past six years.  I presently live on Unit 2.-. in a\nsmall room with three other men.  I'm 33 years old, but I need\nnursing care because I'm paralyzed from the neck down.\n2 .  Recently, the facility has been running cut cf r.-eeded\nsupplies.  A couple of weeks ago, the staff didn't have gauze to\ntreat my sores.  This shortage lasted for a few days.  A week\nago, they ran out of stretch/cling wrap for my foot.  The\nfacility has also run out of catheters for me.  In fact, I've had\nto pay for a catheter myself.  They have also run out of duoderm\ntape.\n' 3.  Overall, there is a shortage of basic care supplies\nsuch as toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs, brushes, soap, lotion,\npaper towels and cups.  I've noticed these items in short supply\nand I've had this confirmed by unit nurses.  As a result, I've\nhad to buy some supplies, like toothpaste, on my own.\n\n*-&*\n4.  Not too long ago, my unit was without hot water for a\nweek to a week and a half.  With no hot water, I was not provided\nwith my normal tub baths during that time; I only had my face\nwashed for the entire period.\n5.  We have had to use plastic utensils instead of\nsilverware alot recently.  I would estimate that this year we\nhave used the plastic about half of the time.  It's my\nunderstanding that the silverware cannot be washed properly so we\nhave to use the plastic.  The plastic utensils are a combination\nof a spoon and a fork, called a \"spork.\"  It is difficult for me\nto eat with the plastic \"sporks\" they give to us.  I've noticed\nother residents having difficulty eating with the \"sporks\" as\nwell.\n6.  The food served to us here is terrible and inadequate.\nIt has gotten worse in recent months because there have besri food\nshortages.  I understand that there is no money to buy enough\nfood for us.  The portions we've been served recently have been\nsmaller than in the past.  I haven't been served a salad in very\nlong time.  We haven't been served juice for lunch or dinner in\nabout three months.  In addition, the food we get is often\novercooked and mushy with no taste.  I can't eat it.  Just about\nevery day I leave most of the food I've been served without\neating it.  As a result, I'm left hungry, so I order food from\noutside vendors like the local Chinese restaurant.  I do this\nthree or four times a week.  Sometimes, my brother will bring me\nfood.  This is how I get by.\n- 2 -\n\n7.  While the outside surveyors were here last week, we\nwere provided with juice at all meals for the first time in\nmonths.  The meals improved during that time as Wall,  Kovsvsr, I\nfully expect the quality of the meals to go down again once\nthey're gone.  This is always the pattern.\n8.  Sons of the staff are disrespectful of our condition.\nNurses and staff have directed hurtful comments to me such as \"at\nleast I'm walking and you're not I\"  They have told me to \"shut\nup.\"  Some have treated me like a child; when I objected, I was\ntold, \"At least my children can do for themselves.\"  They often\nuse profanity.\n9.  Last year, my wheelchair was in need of repair.\nInstead of furnishing me with a replacement wheelchair, I was\nleft in bed for four to five months.\n10.  There are not enough activities to keep me occupied\nduring the day.  I wish I could socialize with others to keep my\nmind active.  However, DCV provides me with little such\nstimulation.\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct.

DECLARATION OF\nWILLIE VEASEY\nPursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1745 and D.C.C. R.\n106(h), I, Willie Veasey, do hereby declare:\n1.  I have been a resident of the D.C. Village Nursing Home\n(\"DCV\") for about the past fifteen years.  I presently live on\nUnit 5A in a room with one other man.  I need nursing care\nbecause I'm dependent on staff for bathing, dressing, and\ntoileting.\n2.  Recently, there have been shortages of needed medical\nsupplies at DCV.  For example, I need to use a urine bag every\nday.  In the past, after the bag had become soiled, I had been\nable to replace it every day.  In recent months however, there\naren't enough bags available at DCV.  I've had to re-use the same\ndirty bag two to three days in a row.  This creates a sanitation\nand health problem.  I recently suffered from a urinary tract\ninfection which I believe was caused by my having to re-use the\nurine bag.  I had to go to the hospital to get treatment for the\ninfection and I had to take antibiotics.  As far as I can\n\nremember, I had never had a urinary tract infection when I was\nable to change my bag everyday.\n3.  I've had two different pressure sores on my buttocks\nand feet.  When staff come in to dress my sore, I've noticed\nrecently that they often lack tape, gauze and bandages.\n4.  About three or four months ago, the meals served to us\nstarted getting bad.  The food they serve us now is terrible.\nThe meals have been unappetizing, they're not nutritious, and\nthey're usually not hot.  In addition, the meal portions have\nbeen greatly reduced.  My three meals together now equal one\nregular meal.  The kitchen workers have told me that they haven't\nhad anything to serve us.  The meals used to be much better last\nyear.  At that time, we were served vegetables, meat and\npasta.\n5.  We haven't been served fresh vegetables in about three\nmonths.  We are also served very little meat.  I'm given peanut\nbutter sandwiches alot.  We are routinely not given anything to\ndrink for lunch and dinner except water.  We are also not\nprovided with little things like sugar, salt or pepper.\n6.  Many times, I don't eat the meal served and I'm left\nhungry.  Since December 1934, I've lost about fourteen pounds.\nThis is certainly not due to any positive intervention fron my\ndietician; as far as I can tell, I'm still on a \"regular\" diet,\nHy weight loss has resulted simply because I end up not eating\nthe bad food they serve me.\n\nfi -TV\n7.  The facility always improves conditions and services\nwhen outsiders tour DCV.  Other than when the outside surveyors\nwere here last week, we had not had juice for months.  In fact,\nlast week when the surveyors were here, food quality improved\ngreatly.  I ate virtually all food served to ne for the first\ntime in a long time.  However, once the surveyors leave, things\nalways revert back to the way they had been.  I expect this to\nhappen again now.  .  ;\n8.  There are staff problems at DCV that are affecting\nresident care right now.  Recently, there have been alot of\nforced retirements and lay-offs, resulting in not enough scaff to\nmeet our needs.\n9.  There is also a problem with contract nurses.  They\ndon't want to pay attention to us.  They don't know who we are.\nAs a result, they have made quite a few mistakes in dispensing\nmedications to me.  I know what I'm supposed to be taking, and\nwhen I tell the nurses that they've made a mistake, they don't\nlike it.\n10.  I would have complained about conditions to someone,\nbut I've realized over the years that complaining doesn't do any\ngood.\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct.

I had my lower leg amputated in December 1994 afcer my\nfoot had become infected from a sore that had developed here at\nDCV.  At firsu, the sore was limited to the top of my foot.  In\nthe course of the next few months, the sore became infected and\nspread to the rest of my foot and to my lower leg.  My doctor at\nDCV told me it would heal, but it never did.  It kept getting\nworse.  Throughout the worsening of the infection, my doctor came\nto see me personally only a very few times.  Instead of visually\ninspecting me and my foot, he would rely on the written reports\nof the nurses.  This is true even though his office was right\naround the corner from me.  I'm bitter about the lack of medical\n\nattention hs gave r,e during this period.  This doctor still works\nat DCV.  .\n3 .  When the infection becane more pronounced and iny foot\nturned completely black, I was eventually sent to Hadley\nHospital.  The doctors and nurses there were shocked at the\ncondition of ny foot and leg.  They said that my condition should\nhave been caught long ago.  I was told that my leg would need to\nbe cut off so that the infection wouldn't spread to the rest: of\nmy body and kill me.  The lower part of my right leg and foot\nwere amputated.\n4.  After I was returned to DCV, at times, the nurses,\nespecially the contract nurses, wouldn't give me medicine to\nalleviate the pain even though the pain was excruciating.  The\ncontract nurses corae in and out; we don't know them and they\ndon't know us.  In fact, the nurses got mad at me for asking for\nthe medication I was entitled to.  Ms. Brasfield never came to\nsee me after I returned.\n5.  I used to be able to walk with a walker.  Now, I can't\nwalk at all.  I'm trying to learn how to walk with crutches.

      "text": "HARRIET A. FIELDS, Ed.D., R.N.\n#604\n1722 19th Street, N.W.\nWashington, DC  20009\nMessage: (202) 234-7142\nU.S. v. District of Columbia\nil\nNH-DC-001-025\nThe Honorable Thomas F. Hogan\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Avenue, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC  20001\nRe:  The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et al., Civ. No. 95-948, TFH,\nD.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV), Court Order, July 6, 1995;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6, 1995;\nCourt Order, December 22, 1996;\nCourt Order, February 23, 1996\nDear Judge Hogan:\nThis letter to the Court is an update since my April 3 letter to the Court on the outplacement of DCV\nresidents to their new homes.\nAs of today, there are 88 residents at DCV remaining to be outplaced.  Of this number, 42 residents\nhave no identified placement site to date.\nMs. Come Kemp is the leader in the outplacement process at DCV.  She is a dedicated professional\nand is active in her advocacy on behalf of the residents and in ensuring, to the best of her ability, that\nthe residents individualized needs will be met.\nAll of the defendants both within and outside DCV, from those designated by Mr. Vernon Hawkins,\nDirector, Department of Human Services, and Dr. Harvey Sloane, Commissioner of Public Health\nfor the District of Columbia, must continue to give Ms. Kemp their undivided support so she may be\nable to guide the remaining outplacements in the professional manner in which she has been operating,\nand for which she has tremendous capabilities. In addition, Ms. Catherine Carroll must also be given\ncontinued and undivided support to carry on her fine work.\nTUT\n\nResidents Identified for Independent Living\nCurrently there are three residents to be outplaced into the community.  There are two  major\nconcerns, one of which is most immediate and critical.\n(1) Immediate Need for CASH\nThe residents will not have access to their Supplemental Security Income (SSI) checks\nuntil after they are discharged and living independently.  The rent for the residents will be $132 and\nthey will receive food stamps.  It is not clear how long it will take until they directly receive their\nchecks; however it is estimated by some this will take two weeks to a month, although the business\noffice at DCV estimates longer.  Therefore, these three residents, Mr. C.W., Ms. M.M., and Mr.\nM.W., upon discharge will need a sufficient supply of money for down payment, rent, telephone,\nfood, and other basic supplies for living.\nMs. Peggy Graves, detailed by Mr. Vernon Hawkins from the Department of Human Services of the\nDistrict  of Columbia, is preparing a financial needs statement for  each resident.  Mr. C.W. is\nscheduled to be discharged to his new home this week.  Ms. M.M. is scheduled to be discharged to\nher new home May 1. A home for Mr. M.W. has not yet been identified.  The residents cannot be\ndischarged without this subsistence level of cash, without which Mr. C.W. and Ms. M.M. face\nloosing their apartments.  This problem is of great concern to all those involved in planning.\nMr. Vernon Hawkins was made aware of this problem in a meeting April 12 with the Court Monitor,\nDr. Harvey Sloane, Ms. Corrie Kemp, Ms. Catherine Carroll, Ms. Peggy Graves, and Ms. Gladys\nFountain.  But as of this date the District of Columbia has not identified a source for the needed\nmoney.\nYesterday at DCV, I reiterated this immediate and serious concern to Dr. Harvey Sloane.  Dr. Sloane\nwas  on his way to a meeting with Mr. Hawkins.  Discharging residents without  this needed\nsubsistence level of cash is essentially assigning residents who have lived within an institution for\nyears to a condition of  homelessness.\n(2) Vocational rehabilitation services\nInstitutionalized residents who will be living in the community need to be meaningfully\nengaged  in  their environments with  purpose  to  their lives in order  to  thrive and  meet  their\nindividualized  needs.  For this to occur,  they need the opportunity to develop  skills through\nvocational rehabilitation.  Responsible management would have initiated vocational rehabilitation\nmonths and months ago.  For the residents decertified for nursing home care years ago, vocational\nrehabilitation should have been initiated years ago.  Lack of initiative and proactive planning for the\nresidents contributed to the rationale for new management of DCV in the Court Monitor's January\n17,  1996,  Status Report.  It is distressing  to  me that  the process  of planning for  vocational\nrehabilitation  was  just  initiated  last  week,  with  the  contact  of  the  Rehabilitation  Services\nAdministration in the Department of Human Services of the District of Columbia.  Follow through\nis vital.\n\nIt is inconceivable to me that Mr. Vernon Hawkins and Ms. Sue Brown will do anything other than\nintercede with the appropriate District of Columbia agencies as needed, so that the major concerns\nidentified  above will be resolved.  Thus, allowing Ms. Kemp and Ms. Carroll to continue their\nleadership and follow through.  This situation will be closely monitored.\nMy April 3 letter to the Court identified six residents who the transition team identified as qualified\nfor  independent  living.  However,  since that  time, the  Occupational  Therapists  and Physical\nTherapists have completed their excellent assessments of the six residents and determined that three\nof the six residents are not sufficiently capable of independence in the activities of daily living, for\nexample, ability to prepare food. In addition, two of the three residents as determined by the health\ncare  team  and  the  residents  have medical  supervision  issues  and  precarious  personal  coping\ncapabilities which prevent them from successfully functioning independently.  Therefore, these two\nresidents will be appropriately outplaced to community residence facilities.  The sites have not been\nselected, although these two residents are in the process of making visits.\nOne resident, Mr. C.F., currently states that he wants to live in the community independently.  There\nare several activities of daily living for which Mr. C.F. would need assistance, for example, dressing\nwith buttons, cooking, shopping (removing items from shelves and carrying them home), bathing,\ndetermining water temperature, laundry, and descending stairs.  The community would be the \"least\nrestrictive\" environment according to federal law for him, however, it would not be safe nor would\nhe be able to function independently unless Mr. C.F. had available to him a personal care aide seven\ndays a week to perform the above tasks, among various others. Currently, there is a lack of sufficient\npersonal care aides in the District of Columbia to perform such tasks seven days a week for Mr. C.F.\nI will keep the Court informed of the progress in planning for the most appropriate outplacement for\nMr. C.F. in accordance with the Court Orders and federal law, the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nResidents with Mental Illness\nThirty-four residents who were on the list of still indeterminate origin of residents with mental illness\nhave been outplaced.  All of these residents have a primary medical diagnosis requiring long term\nnursing home care, as recently assessed by the transition team that included Geriatric Psychological\nSystems, Inc. (GPS). One resident was discharged to his family after extensive review and evaluation\nand a one week trial visit. A return assessment after the one week visit was conducted with his family\nand the transition team including GPS, which is currently serving as the Speciality Consultation Team\nfor residents with mental illness.\nThere are 35 residents remaining at DCV.  Sixteen are being considered  by three nursing homes in\nthe area.  All these remaining residents have a primary medical diagnosis requiring long term nursing\nhome care.\nOne resident, Mr. E.J., whose primary diagnosis is mental illness, as recently evaluated by GPS, will\nbe outplaced to a community residence facility for persons with mental illness.  Mr. E. J. has visited\n\ntwo sites to date and will visit at least two more sites before outplacement to a community residence.\nThe site has not been finalized to date.\nResidents with Mental Retardation\nThis past week, two residents, Ms. A.R. and Mr. K.F., were outplaced to Wholistic a group home\nfor residents with mental retardation.  Georgetown University Child Development Center (GUCDC)\nhas been serving as on-site consultants to Wholistic, and GUCDC staff accompanied the residents to\ntheir new homes. In addition, staff from DCV spent last weekend (the residents first weekend in their\nnew homes) with these individuals for the day and evening shifts.\nAlthough an interim rate still has not been mutually agreed upon, D.C. Family Services as of\nyesterday \"has every intention\" of accepting the six residents identified for outplacement.  There is\nstill no date for staff training and no admission date for the residents.  At this point, there seems to\nbe no good faith effort to resolve the interim rate dispute.\nThere still remains one resident, Mr. P.L., for whom no outplacement site has been secured.\nThe District is well beyond the agreed upon and Court Ordered February 29,1996, outplacement date\nfor residents with mental retardation.\nVisits to Outplacement Sites\nThe Court Monitor, with a nursing home systems expert consultant, is visiting residents outplaced\nto their new homes in order to determine continued appropriateness of setting and to ensure that the\nresidents' individualized needs are met in accordance with the Court Orders.\nI have visited J.B. Johnson Nursing Center and the 15 residents outplaced there to date; met with the\nnew  management  company,  the  administrator,  admissions  coordinator,  therapeutic  recreation\ndirector, toured all the units with the director of nursing; and met with all the residents.  The new\nmanagement company is open to any suggestions for improving care for the residents.  I found the\nresidents happy and alert, something I did not consistently see at DCV.\nI have visited a proposed outplacement site operated by Allegis Health Care Centers in Grosvenor,\nMaryland.\nMy major concern to date is the staff-to- resident ratio at Carroll Manor Nursing Home in Hyattsville,\nMaryland.  Over 50 DCV residents have been outplaced there to date.  The current ratio is one\ncertified nurse assistant to 12 residents during the day.  As mentioned in my April 3 letter to the\nCourt, this facility is undergoing new management, however, the arrangements made to outplace\nresidents there were made with Providence Hospital and Sr. Carol and Mr. Ed Cook, Vice President.\nI will be meeting with them soon to review the Court Orders in order that I may be able to assure the\nCourt that the Court Orders will be met for the best interests of the residents.  The Geriatrician at\n\nCarroll Manor is giving extra attention to ensure that the residents medical needs will be met, since\nthis facility is in the process of hiring new staff.  The staffing issue was originally pointed out to the\nCourt Monitor and the nursing home systems expert consultant by the sister of a recently outplaced\nDCV resident.\nPersonal Needs Allowance (PNA)\nI am enclosing my March 7, 1996, letter to Ms. Alberta Brasfield requesting information on the\nresidents' PNA  Ms. Brasfield responded on March 13 and March 21, and I am grateful for her\nattention to the matter. In Ms. Brasfield's responses, admissions are made that the residents' \"PNA\nbalances [are being] held by the District of Columbia\" (March 13) and that there were \"moneys\npreviously held by District of Columbia on behalf of DCV residents\" (March 21).  This is in violation\nof federal law and regulations.  However, I am happy for the residents sake that, as of March 19,\n1996, all residents' PNA accounts remaining in the D.C. Treasury were transferred to separate\ninterest-bearing PNA accounts on each resident's behalf at Independence Federal Savings Bank.\nAccording to personnel in the business office at DCV, on December 14, 1995, separate accounts\nwere established for the residents at Independence Federal Savings Bank (USB), one for the PNA\nand one for Cost of Care. Many residents already had personal savings accounts established at JJFSB.\nFor the most part when the residents' PNA was in the D.C. Treasury it was transferred quarterly to\nIF SB.  Therefore, the District did retain what could have been interest for the residents in violation\nof federal law. However, in order to research this further, it would take away energies and resources\nnow more directly needed for the residents in monitoring their outplacement to their new homes.  In\naddition, the computer records for the residents is in somewhat of a chaotic state of affairs.  As of\nOctober 1995, the business office computers at DCV were removed by the Office of Long Term Care\nAdministrator and since then are no longer  hooked into the main frame computers within the Office\nof Long  Term Care Administration  in the Department  of Human  Services for  the District  of\nColumbia.  Therefore,  the  Office  of Long  Term  Care Administration  does not  have  current\ninformation on residents accounts since October. And, the DCV business office does not have access\nto computer records since mid-October.  Therefore, all accounts from mid-October to date are hand\nentered in booklets.  This system within the Long Term Care Administration and DCV is primitive\nand, as indicated by the business office personnel at DCV, would probably be a \"nightmare for\nauditors.\"\nWhile visiting residents outplaced to J.B. Johnson Nursing Center last week, I inquired about the\nresidents' PNA.  The residents all have their PNA accounts, information for which was easily\nretrieved by the facilities state-of-the-art computers. I was told by the business office at J.B. Johnson\nthat, until new management took over the facility in December, the facility had the same primitive\naccounting set-up with the Office of Long Term Care Administration.  (J.B. Johnson Nursing Center\nis owned by the District but now privately managed by the same group which manages Washington\nCenter for Aging Services, also owned by the District.)\n\nNow when DCV residents are outplaced, checks from their EFSB personal savings accounts, PNA\naccounts, and if they have one, their burial accounts, either accompany the residents to the new\nfacilities, or are mailed within a few days.  These reactive steps taken by the defendants are all in the\nresidents' best interests. If it were not for the presence of the Court at DCV, residents' rights would\nstill be violated.\nMr. Alex Teneza, accounting technician in the business office at DCV, has demonstrated a kindly\nsensitivity to the plight of the residents' living situation.  Mr. Esmeraldo Cruz, accountant in the\nbusiness office at DCV, has been helpful in supplying information.\nChronic Non-Compliance of Payment of Vendors\nAttached to this letter to the Court is an updated 'DC Village Nursing Home Vendor Report'.  Direct\ncare providers are still without payment in violation of the Court Orders and one contract nursing\nstaff vendor has still not been able to resume needed direct care services.\nSome examples of overdue payments to direct care providers (nursing and physical therapy) in\nviolation of the Court Orders are the following:\n•  National Nurses Inc., although payments have been made, is still owed $24,663.11.\n•  SRT-Premeir is owed $52,594.59.\n•  Total Healthcare Resources, Inc. (THR) is owed $52,953.50 and is unable to reinstate their\nvaluable direct caregivers until paid.\n•  CUP is owed $20,882.13 and indicates they will have to discontinue services this weekend\nif not paid.\n•  Therapeutic Management Services (TMS) provides essential and needed physical therapy\nservices, which are now vital in the health team assessment of the residents for transition\nplanning to their new homes. Their services are vital in order to identify the most appropriate\nsetting to meet the residents' individualized needs.  The physical therapists have always\nresponded professionally to any requests to assess the residents in addition to their own\nproactive professional behavior on behalf of the residents.  TMS has still not been paid for\nJanuary services on an invoice submitted February 13. This non payment was brought to the\nattention of Mr. Vemon Hawkins in the April 12 meeting referred to previously in this letter\nunder Residents Identified for Independent Living.\nAt this meeting Ms. Gladys Fountain told Mr. Hawkins that TMS has not been paid for January\nservices because their invoice was submitted with their February invoice and the District cannot pay\ntwo invoices at once. Ms. Fountain received this information from a phone call made during this\nmeeting to Mr. Terry Thomas, former administrator at DCV, working on behalf of Ms. Queen in the\nTFT\n\nDepartment of Human Services.  The information given by Ms. Fountain to Mr. Hawkins was false.\nThe February invoice was submitted March 10.  I pointed out the facts and the inaccuracies in Ms.\nFountain's statement to the April 12 meeting attendees, and suggested that they call the president of\nTMS into the meeting and verify it, since I had just seen the physical therapist in the hallway on her\nway to assess a resident at the bedside.  The physical therapist was not asked to validate the correct\ninformation nor has TMS been paid for January services in the amount of $5145.00.  In previous\nreports to the Court, I have chronicled the non-payment of services to this critical direct care vendor.\nThe physical therapists function without payment out of care, concern, and compassion for the\nresidents. This is a small business and is pained by lack of payment.  My concern is that the physical\ntherapists will be taken advantage of, and that if DCV does close as projected within several weeks,\nthey will not be paid at all, which would be unconscionable.  To me this scenario alone warrants an\nescrow account to assure payment and/or a Court Order to guarantee payment.\nYesterday, I received a copy of the defendants' pleading Opposition of the District of Columbia to\nthe Motions of Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenor for Further Relief to Remedy Continuing Contempt\nand for Contempt Sanctions.\nI have a few concerns regarding this, they are the following:\n(1) On page 3, the defendants state that as of April 18, 1996, the \"contracts for National\nNurses and American Therapeutics were pending approval at the control board.\"  I called the D.C.\nFinancial Control Board this morning to verify this statement because it was not known to me that\nthere were any outstanding contracts for these two vendors.  According to Mr. Doneg McDonough\nof the Control Board this statement in the defendants pleading is false and \"does not match our\nrecords here.\"\nThe Control Board records indicate that for National Nurses, Inc., a 120 day contract for 24 hour\ncoverage for the period March 1 through June 28, 1996, was approved February 28, 1996.  This\nFebruary date is the last activity for a contract for National Nurses with the Control Board.\nThe Control Board records for American Therapeutics indicate that a 120 day contract for services\nfrom February 18 through June 18, 1996, was reviewed and approved February 21, 1996.  This\nFebruary date is the last activity for a contract for American Therapeutics with the Control Board.\nGiven the front page article in the Metro section of today's, Thursday, April 25, 1996, Washington\nPost and similar coverage on WTOP radio news this morning, these false assertions are particularly\nproblematic to me. The article and radio news broadcast profile false assertions about contracts made\nby the Department of Human Services and Mr. Veraon Hawkins.\n(2) Page 4 of the pleading states that the \"defendants took immediate and appropriate action\nto resolve matters adversely affecting their ability to timely pay the D.C. Village vendors.\"  These\nsame vendors who supply vital direct nursing care services are still not payed in violation of the Court\nOrders. The fact is that the treatment nurse supplied by THR switched contract nurse staff vendors\n\nin order to receive a pay check. However, the contract nurse staffing vendor to which the treatment\nnurse switched subsequently threatened termination of services because of lack of payment.\n(3) On page 10 of the pleading the defendants refer to the \"imminent closure of the facility\"\nand \"less than 100 residents whose numbers are being reduced almost daily\".  If there is one but one\nlong term care resident at DCV,  it is the duty of the District of Columbia to provide services.\nOnce again Judge Hogan, it is a privilege to serve the Court and to work with all concerned parties\nfor the best interests of the long term care residents of the District of Columbia.\nSincerely,\nHarriet A.

The plaintiffs oppose the motion.\nThe defendants claim that because the D.C. Village facility is now closed, and all\nformer residents have been placed elsewhere, there is nothing left for the Monitor to oversee.\nThey claim that the Monitor has had ample time to determine the appropriateness of\nplacements, since the last resident left D.C. Village on June 24, 1996, and that any further\nproblems should be handled by the ombudsman, not the Monitor.\nThe defendants have misconstrued the scope of the Court's order.  The Court has\nordered the Monitor not only to oversee the closing of the D.C. Village facility, but also to\ndetermine that \"all residents are transferred to appropriate residences which meet their\nft)\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nindividual needs.\" Order Mod. Stip. Order of July 6, 1995, Nov. 7, at 2.  The order asks the\nMonitor to ensure that not only the discharges, but also the placements, of the residents are\nsufficient and that they satisfactorily fit their individual needs.  This necessarily contemplates\nindividualized inspections and evaluations of post-discharge placement.  Until the Monitor\nhas completed and reported to the Court on such an inspection and evaluation for each of the\nformer D.C. Village residents, her duties under the order are not finished, and termination of\nher position is premature.\nThe thorough inspections and evaluations necessary to proper completion of the\nMonitor's duties must naturally take some time.  The Monitor is taking all steps to ensure the\nswift completion of her tasks and should be given a reasonable time to fulfill her duties.\nSince the Monitor has not yet indicated to the Court that she has evaluated all the\nplacements of former D.C. Village residents and determined them to satisfactorily meet the\nresidents' needs, termination of her duties at this time would be premature.\nIt is therefore ORDERED that the defendants' motion to terminate the appointment of\nthe Monitor is DENIED.\nAugust\nThomas F. Ho\nUnited States Distr?\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)",

      "text": "U.S. v. District of Columbia\nNH-DC-001-001\nAEP:BPS:DD:CA:drb\nDJ  168-16-11   ,  9\n  AUG\nREGISTERED MAIL\nRETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED\nHonorable Sharon Pratt Dixon\nMayor of the District of Columbia\nDistrict Building\n1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C  20004\nRe:  District of Columbia Village Nursing Home\nCRIPA Investigation\nDear Mayor Dixon:\nOn August 20, 1990, we notified the Mayor's Office of our\nintention to investigate the District of Columbia Village Nursing\nHome (D.C. Village) pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act  (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. §1997 et seq.\nAs contemplated by CRIPA, we are now writing to inform you of the\nfindings of our investigation and to outline the minimum measures\nnecessary to remedy the unconstitutional conditions at D.C.\nVillage.\nIn connection with our investigation, attorneys from the\nDepartment of Justice toured D.C. Village on January 24-25, 1991,\nwith two geriatric care specialists - a psychiatrist and a\nclinical nurse.  In addition to touring the facility, each\nconsultant observed residents, conducted interviews and reviewed\ncare records and other documents.  Throughout the investigation,\nDistrict representatives were helpful and cooperative.  We\nappreciate their efforts.\nD.C. Village is licensed and designed as a long-term care\nnursing home for geriatric patients.  However, the District has\nalso chosen to place at the facility persons with acute and\nchronic mental illness, mental retardation, severe physical\nhandicaps and children who are mentally ill, mentally retarded or\nboth, or simply \"boarder babies\" —  all placed at D.C. Village as\noverflow from other parts of the District's institutional care\nsystem.  Thus, D.C. Village is being asked to function as a\nchronic care hospital, as an acute care psychiatric treatment\nfacility and as a facility for the developmentally disabled,\ncc:  Records  Chrono  Peabody  Schoen  Deutsch  Alford  Hold\nIT\n\n- 2 -\nalthough it is organized, staffed, funded and licensed as a\nnursing home.\nOur investigation found that D.C. Village is generally\nproviding adequate nursing and medical care for its geriatric\npatients.  Likewise, adequate custodial care is being provided\nfor the children, including \"boarder babies,\" residing at the\nfacility.  However, D.C. Village is simply not equipped to\nprovide the specialized treatment and training required for its\nmentally ill and mentally retarded populations.  Were these\nresidents to be appropriately placed in care facilities designed\nand staffed to meet their specialized needs, the chances that\nthey would receive appropriate training and treatment would be\ndramatically increased.  Nevertheless, to the extent that\nmentally ill and mentally retarded individuals are confined at\nD.C. Village, the District is required to provide adequate\npsychiatric care and such training as would ensure that they are\nnot exposed to unreasonable risks to their personal safety and\nare free from undue bodily and chemical restraint.  See Youngbera\nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324  (1982).\nAlthough there have been improvements made at D.C. Village\nin recent months, our investigation identified several conditions\nwhich continue to pose health and safety risks to D.C. Village\nresidents, thereby denying them their constitutional rights to\nadequate medical care and a reasonably safe environment.  As\ndetailed below, the deficiencies that have caused unconstitu-\ntional conditions include:  D.C. Village's failure to provide\nminimally adequate training programs sufficient to ensure that\nresidents are free from undue restraint; inadequate psychiatric\ncare; insufficient numbers and training of staff; and inadequate\nrecordkeeping.\nI.  Inadequate Training Programs\nD.C. Village fails to provide professionally developed\nindividualized training programs that are sufficient to ensure\nthat residents are not subjected to unwarranted and unreasonable\nrestraints.  Following a careful review, our consultant\npsychiatrist concluded that physical and chemical restraints are\nboth overused and dangerously misused by D.C. Village staff on\nresidents because of the unavailability of trained and supervised\nprofessional and direct care staff, as well as the lack of\nessential training programs.\nD.C. Village staff consistently fail to identify and\neliminate circumstances which provoke problematic behaviors in\nresidents, particularly those who are mentally retarded.  Both of\nour consultants found that staff intervention focuses almost\nexclusively on restraint to control maladaptive or aggressive\nbehavior, without resort to other recognized therapy methods.\nThroughout their tour, our consultants observed physical\n\n|M| o  _\nrestraints  (posey vests) routinely fastened backwards which\nplaces residents at risk of strangulation.\nLikewise, our consultants found current D.C. Village\nbehavioral programs to be inadequate.  For example, the records\nreviewed document that residents demonstrating self-injurious,\nphysically abusive or other destructive behaviors are not being\nprovided appropriate training to reduce or eliminate such\nbehaviors.\nIn addition, the limited behavior programs that are\nprovided are not data based and thereby fail to meet professional\nstandards.  D.C. Village lacks a facility-wide behavioral\nobservation system that is used by all staff.  Absent appropriate\ndata, D.C. Village staff cannot evaluate whether behavior\nprograms are effective.\nStaff also fail to collect and provide behavioral data to\nthe consulting psychiatrist for evaluation of the need for\ncontinued medication.  The psychiatrist is thus limited in his\nability to determine whether medication should be adjusted or\nwithdrawn resulting in the risk of undue chemical restraint.\nD.C. Village also fails to provide adequate behavioral\nprogramming for residents taking psychotropic medication.  The\nprogramming that does exist, moreover, is not integrated with the\nuse of psychotropic medication.\nThus, D.C. Village's failure to provide professionally\ndesigned and implemented individualized training programs has\nresulted in residents being subjected to unreasonable physical\nand chemical restraints.\nII.  Inadequate Psychiatric Care  «.\nOur consultants concluded that D.C. Village's use and\nmonitoring of psychoactive medications depart from accepted\nmedical practice and fail to protect residents from serious risks\nof harm.  ^Our consultants found that D.C. Village has inadequate\nprocedures for monitoring the effectiveness of medications\nprescribed.  As a result, residents are not treated for side\neffects or may continue to receive medications that are not\neffective and do not resolve their medical conditions.  For\nexample, high dosages of psychoactive medications are widely\nused, despite the absence of relevant clinical indications.\nNecessary evaluations of medications are not made nor is there\nevidence of attempts at \"drug-holidays\" or at gradual reduction\nafter extended usage at the same dosage.  Of equal concern is the\nfrequent use of psychoactive drugs on a PRN (\"as needed\") basis.\nThe use of psychotropic medications without appropriate\nmonitoring by qualified professionals can result in serious harm\nto residents.\n\n(?•:- =\n- 4 -\nOur interviews with the nursing staff disclosed that D.C.\nVillage's psychiatric consultant rarely comes to the facility to\nreview resident records or speak to staff.  Residents are often\nsent to the psychiatrist's office without their records.  The\nexchange of behavioral data between the consulting psychiatrist\nand D.C. Village is minimal.  Without such information, the\npsychiatrist's ability to determine whether medication should be\nadjusted or withdrawn completely is undermined.  Residents taking\nsuch medication are placed at increased risk of being subjected\nto undue chemical restraint or harm from drug side-effects.\nIII.  Insufficient Numbers and Training of Staff\nOur investigation found that D.C. Village is generally\nproviding adequate nursing and medical care for its geriatric and\nadolescent patients.  However, D.C. Village is simply not\nequipped to provide the specialized treatment and training\nrequired for its mentally ill and mentally retarded populations.\nGiven the pressing needs of its residents, the most glaring\npersonnel deficiency is the shortage of staff with specialized\ntraining.  As noted, while D.C. Village is licensed as a nursing\nhome, a significant number of residents there have serious\npsychiatric illnesses and/or are developmentally disabled,\nseverely impaired and difficult to manage.  Our consultants\nconcluded that the current D.C. Village staff are inadequate to\ndeal with the complex psychiatric and medical needs of these\npopulations.\nBoth of our consultants concluded that D.C. Village has an\ninsufficient number of psychiatric and psychology staff to\nprovide adequate care and training and to render necessary\nprofessional judgments.  Consequently, residents are not\nreceiving the care and training necessary to protect them from\nunreasonable risks to their personal safety and to ensure freedom\nfrom, undue bodily restraint.\nIV.  Inadequate Recordkeeping\nInadequate recordkeeping practices have compromised D.C.\nVillage's ability to provide adequate care to its residents.\nOur consultants found that D.C. Village lacks a record-keeping\nsystem sufficient to provide accurate, relevant and timely\ninformation upon which professional decisions may be based\nregarding the necessary care for residents.  Our consultant\nconcluded that, although resident records are well maintained by\nnursing staff, meaningful progress notes by other appropriate\nprofessionals are either absent or inadequate.  Records lack\nsufficient information to justify orders for medications or\nchanges in medication, thereby adding to the difficulty of\nproviding continuity of care.  The absence of such data\nundermines the ability to assess the interaction of drugs and\n\n- 5 -\nbehavioral intervention, a process necessary to evaluating\ntreatment efficacy.\nV.  Minimal Remedial Measures\nThe aforementioned conditions deprive D.C. Village residents\nof their constitutional rights.  To rectify these deficiencies\nand to ensure that constitutionally adequate conditions are\nestablished and maintained at D.C. Village, we propose to enter\ninto a legally binding and judicially enforceable agreement with\nthe District of Columbia that provides, at a minimum, for the\nfollowing remedies:\n1.  D.C. Village must modify and/or implement medication\npractices to ensure that they comport with accepted professional\nmedical standards;\n2.  D.C. Village must provide professionally designed\ntraining programs for those residents for whom such training can\nreduce or eliminate unreasonable risks to their personal safety\nand/or the use of undue bodily restraint.  Residents with self-\ninjurious, physically abusive or other destructive behaviors\nmust be identified immediately and provided training to reduce\nor eliminate such behaviors;\n3.  D.C. Village must hire and employ a sufficient number of\nqualified professional staff to provide adequate psychiatric\ncare, as well as to design and implement the kind of training\nprograms described in paragraph 2 above;\n4.  D.C. Village must train staff in behavior therapy and\nmethodology sufficient to provide D.C. Village residents with\nminimally adequate training, as described- in paragraph 2 above;\n5.  D.C. Village must improve recordkeeping and\nadministrative practices to enable qualified professionals to\nmake judgments regarding resident treatment and training.\nAs we have noted, many of the above remedies would be\nrendered moot if the decision were made to appropriately place\nindividuals in accordance with their specialized needs in other\nfacilities able to meet such needs.  Failing that, the above\nremedies are necessary in order to afford D.C. Village residents\ntheir constitutional rights.\nInformation about Federal financial assistance which may\nbe available to assist with the remedial process can be obtained\nthrough the United States Department of Health and Human\nServices' Regional Office (Director, Intergovernmental and\nCongressional Affairs), and through appropriate officials of\nthe United States Department of Education.\n\nt •\n— 6 ~*\nOur attorneys will be contacting legal counsel for the\nDistrict's Department of Human Resources shortly to arrange a\nmeeting to discuss this matter in greater detail.  In the\nmeantime, should you or your staff have any questions regarding\nthis matter, please feel free to call Arthur E. Peabody, Jr.,\nChief, Special Litigation Section, at (202) 514-6255.  To date,\nwe have been able to conduct this investigation in the spirit of\ncooperation intended by the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPersons Act, and look forward to continuing to work in the same\nmanner with District officials toward an amicable resolution of\nthis matter.\nSincerely,\nJohn R. Dunne\nAssistant Attorney General\nCivil Rights Division\ncc:  Honorable John Payton\nCorporation Counsel\nfor the District of Columbia\nJay Stephens, Esquire\nUnited States Attorney\nfor the District of Columbia\nMr. Terry Thomas\nAdministrator\nD.C.

Hogan\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n333 Constitution Ave, NW, 4th Floor\nWashington, DC 20001\nRe:  The United States of America v. The District of Columbia, et al., Civ. No. 95-948, TFH,\nD.C. Village Nursing Home (DCV), Court Order, July 6, 1995;\nNovember 7, Order Modifying Stipulated Order of July 6, 1995;\nCourt Order, December 22, 1996;\nCourt Order, February 23, 1996\nDear Judge Hogan:\nI have obtained a copy of the defendants June 25 submission to the Court and I am compelled to\ncomment.\nNow, after the last resident has been outplaced, I am very disappointed in the District of\nColumbia's position regarding payment to Georgetown University Child Development Center\n(GUCDC).  As I pointed out in my June 16 letter to the Court, GUCDC is the only vendor with\nstill \"ongoing, vital, and direct\" contact with the residents as the Specialty Consultation Team for\nresidents with mental retardation pursuant to the December 22, 1995, Court Order, through the\nextension of their contract to September 30, 1996. Therefore, to say that payment to this vendor\nis \"moot\" because there are no more residents is false, misleading, and makes a mockery of the\nCourt and its Orders.\nThere seems to be little appreciation by the defendants of the seriousness of the Court finding\nthem in of contempt of the Court Orders.  The defendants would have failed to care for its  most\nvulnerable, infirmed, and poor were it not for the presence and intervention of the Court.  Now\nthe defendants are quibbling over which U.S. District Court's Orders they are continuing to\nviolate.  The one page attachment to this letter to the Court is a list I received from GUCDC of\nthe residents with mental retardation living at DCV at the time I commenced my monitoring\nan  1  iurr\n\nduties.  Of the fourteen remaining living residents, nearly half are not and never have been Evans\n(Pratt) class members - Ms. A.B. at Health Care Institute; Ms. S.P., Mr. T.M., and Mr. T.S. at\nD.C. Family Services; and Ms. A.R. and Ms. D.L. at Wholistic Habilitative Services.  Yet all the\nliving residents on this list benefit by the ongoing intervention and expertise of GUCDC.  In\nApril the defendants presented an unseemly request to this Court to issue Court Orders to pay\nother vendors for which they alleged there were no contracts and thus were prohibited under\nDistrict law to pay.  For the best interests of the residents, the Court graciously complied.  And\nyet, in this instance, the defendants admit that GUCDC is a DCV vendor providing ongoing\nservices to residents; they acknowledge there are serious amounts in overdue payments pursuant\nto the July 6 Court Order under 'Payment of Vendor'; and yet they are continuing the contempt\nof the Court Order of July 6.\nIn my January 17 Status Report I profiled how GUCDC staff did not know from day to day,\nweek to week if they would still be employed because the GUCDC contract was immently due to\nexpire and it had not been renewed.  According to the accounts analyst at GUCDC, this vendor\nwas without a contact from the defendants from January to May of 1995. While the defendants\nrequest the Court to issue Court Orders so other vendors may be paid, the defendants were and\nare ignoring, violating, and continuing the contempt of the existing Court Order which applies to\npayment of this vendor.  In the Bi-weekly Report to the Court pursuant to the December 22,\n1995, Court Order, no mention is ever made of the \"financial...problems\" of non-payment of this\nvendor.\nThe logic of the defendants position escapes me.  The defendants must not realize it, but looking\nobjectively, their position is disrespectful of the Court.  The defendants seem to be playing one\nU.S. District Court Chamber against another.  GUCDC contract for Specialty Consultation Team\nservices continues through September 30, 1996.  Their position, that since GUCDC has not\nthreatened termination of its services non-payment to this vendor does no harm, is callous and\nirresponsible.  It is this type of thinking that led me to the conclusion that DCV needed new\nmanagement in my January 17, 1996,  Status Report to the Court.  It seems to this day that the\ndefendants do not hold dear their civic responsibility to care for the District of Columbia's most\nvulnerable, frail, infirmed, and poor - those who cannot defend themselves.  I only report facts,\ndata that is corroborated, and the truth as I see it.  Therefore, only when I received from the\nGUCDC accounts analyst report on June 13 (although I requested it in April) did I submit to the\nCourt the status of payment to this vendor.\nMRDDA is part of the defendant class in this case.  The defendants are admitting that MRDDA\nis disregarding Court Orders. I am also concerned that MRDDA be held accountable pursuant to\nthe July 6 Court Order, to appropriately plan with GUCDC and the group home provider to offer\nthe off-site Day Programs to Ms. S.A. and Ms. S.P., when the experts agree it is the appropriate\ntime for them to benefit from such programming.  Last Friday, June 21, 1996,1 met with Ms. Sue\nBrown and the program coordinator for GUCDC to develop a plan in which MRDDA, GUCDC,\nand the group home provider for these two residents, D.C. Family Services, could all work\ntogether to proactively identify an appropriate day program for Ms. S.A. and Ms. S.P.  We also\n\ndiscussed training of the day program staff by GUCDC in the care of these residents so that when\nthe expert consultation team deems Ms. S.A. and Ms. S.P are ready for off-site Day Programs,\nsystems will be in place to receive these residents, including care of their gastric and\ntracheostomy tubes respectively. (These concerns were profiled in my June 16 and June 6, 1996,\nsubmissions to the Court.)  I urge the defendants to take advantage of GUCDC expertise now,\nbefore the GUCDC contract is due to expire.  This morning I had a telephone conversation with\nMs. Frances Bowie, Administrator of MRDDA relating the above to her.  Ms. Bowie informed\nme that next Tuesday a meeting is scheduled with MRDDA and GUCDC to discuss among other\nthings, the above concern regarding off-site day programs and the possible extension of the\nGUCDC contract so that the mental retardation community in the District will have further\nbenefit of their expertise.  During the next several weeks while I focus my monitoring activities\non visiting the residents in their new homes, I will also monitor the progress of planning for the\noff-site day programs for the two residents mentioned above.\nPreliminary data on two residents, Mr. C.F. and Ms. S.B., outplaced recently, one of whom was\nthe last resident to leave DCV, indicate that they are thriving and happy.  Mr. C.F. is in an\nindependent/supported living arrangement in the community with a personal care aide four hours\na day, five days a week, who among other duties provides needed assistance with the preparation\nof his meals.  Mr. C.F. reports he will be planning with the building manager to develop\nprograms for the tenants regarding, among other topics, residents' rights.  I have never heard Mr.\nC.F. happier, nor have I heard Ms. S.B., outplaced recently to Stoddard Baptist Nursing Home,\nhappier with a lightness and gaiety to her voice, something which was completely undetectable\nwhile she was residing at DCV.  Ms. S.B. has told me that she is \"not used to such kind\ntreatment,\" and just yesterday she added, \"we have fun over here.\" This resident also soberingly\nreminded me that \"we had to pay for the District's poor management, some paid with their\nlives.\"\nJudge Hogan, it is a privilege to serve your Court for the best interests of the long term care\nresidents of the District of Columbia.\nSincerely,\na\nHarriet A.
