    "summary": "<p>On September 14, 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit under 31 U.S.C. § 3729 (the False Claims Act) against Greenbelt Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.  The Center's parent corporations, Northern Health Facility and Extendicare Health Services, were also named defendants.  The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.</p><p>The government alleged that the Center had failed to comply with the provisions required for facilities filing claims for Medicare and Medicaid bills, and its lack of compliance indicated a failure to provide adequate care to residents.  The claim was prompted by reports from the State of Maryland, which surveyed the facility in January 1998 and found it to be out of compliance with Medicaid provider participation requirements and with standards of proper patient care.</p><p>After several attempts to revise its policies, Greenbelt successfully demonstrated to the State of Maryland and the federal Health Care Financing Administration its compliance with Medicare provider requirements, and its certifications were reinstated in July 1998.</p><p>Despite the reinstatement of the facility's Medicare provider status, a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the Greenbelt's noncompliance continued.  An August 1998 visit to the facility revealed that it was still failing to meet Medicare program requirements and failing to provide adequate care to patients.  </p><p>The government's complaints about Greenbelt's deficiencies in care included a failure to provide adequate health care, to administer medication properly, or to provide wound care.  Greenbelt also failed to meet residents' nutritional needs.  Furthermore, staff training was insufficient.  As such, the government alleged that Greenbelt's submission of claims for payment to Medicare and Medicaid programs for January - August 1998 violated the False Claims Act, in that the claims falsely represented compliance with conditions for payment under the Nursing Home Reform Act. The government asked the court for preliminary injunctive relief and monetary damages as a penalty.</p><p>On September 14, 1998, the court (Judge Alexander Williams, Jr.) approved the parties' Joint Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief.  The Motion provided for Greenbelt to comply with the Nursing Home Reform Act, in particular those portions regarding Medicaid and Medicare payments.

AW 98-4006.\nUnited States District Court, D. Maryland, Southern Division.\nDecember 28, 1998.\n564 *564 Kimberly Nichelson Tarver, Washington, DC, Howard L. Sollins, Baltimore, MD, for plaintiff.\nPhilip D. Bartz, Sheila M. Lieber, Martha Hirchfield, Washington, DC, for defendant U.S.\n565 *565 Margaret Ann Nolan, Elizabeth M. Kameen, Baltimore, MD, for defendant State of Maryland.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nWILLIAMS, District Judge.\nI\nCurrently pending before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. The Court has\nconsidered the motion, the opposition thereto, and the entire record, including the testimony presented by\nwitnesses and the arguments made by counsel in the hearing held in open court on December 9, 1998. For the\nreasons that follow, the Court will deny this Motion.\nII\nBackground\nPlaintiff, Northern Health Facilities, Inc., d/b/a Greenbelt Nursing and Rehabilitation Center (\"Greenbelt\"), is a 132\nbed facility, which is currently occupied by 85 residents. About 90% of Greenbelt's residents receive Medicaid\nbenefits. Greenbelt was certified as a skilled nursing facility (\"SNF\") under the federal Medicare program prior to\nSeptember 26, 1998. Greenbelt was also certified as a nursing facility (\"NF\") under the Maryland Medical\nAssistance Program prior to October 26, 1998.\nPlaintiff asks the Court to enjoin Defendant Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of the United States Department of\nHealth and Human Services (\"HHS\"), and Defendant Martin P. Wasserman, Secretary of the Maryland\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene (\"MDHMH\") from terminating its participation and its funding under the\nMedicare and Medicaid programs. Plaintiff contends that the termination violates the Medicare and Medicaid\nActs, and its due process rights Plaintiff further contends that \"[s]uch relief is appropriate to preserve the status\nquo pending completion of the usual administrative process, and to prevent irreparable injury to Greenbelt and its\nelderly and disabled residents.\" (Plaintiff's Memorandum at 2.)\nThe Medicare program, established pursuant to Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq., is\nfederal program designed to provide health insurance for the aged, blind, and disabled. Health Care Financing\nAdministration (\"HCFA\"), an agency within HHS, oversees the implementation of this program. The Medicaid\nprogram, established pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., is a joint program,\nfunded by both the federal and state government, designed to provide medical assistance to certain persons in\n\nneed. HCFA has a supervisory role over the state agencies which implement the Medicaid program. In Maryland,\nthe MDHMH is the agency which implements the program.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid programs both reimburse nursing facilities for certain services provided to their\nresidents. To qualify for reimbursement, a facility must be certified to participate in the programs. To be certified\nunder the Medicare program, a facility must be in \"substantial compliance\" with various requirements set forth in\n42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)-(d), and in the federal regulations found in 42 C.F.R. § 483.1 et seq. To be certified under\nthe Medicaid program, a facility must be in \"substantial compliance\" with various requirements set forth in 42\nU.S.C. § 1396r (b)-(d), and in the federal regulations found in 42 C.F.R. § 442.1 et seq. The state survey\nagencies typically are responsible for conducting inspections of the facilities to ensure their compliance with the\nparticipation requirements. In Maryland, the Licensing and Certification Administration (\"LCA\"), an agency within\nMDHMH, sends survey teams to make these periodic evaluations. HCFA makes the final determination as to\n566 certification in the Medicare program as it is solely a federal program. HCFA *566 can exercise \"look behind\nauthority,\" and conduct its own surveys of facilities under the joint Medicaid program.\nIn January of this year, LCA surveyors visited Greenbelt. Due to this survey, Greenbelt was found not to be in\nsubstantial compliance with the Medicare and Medicaid regulations as of January 26, 1998. Pursuant to the\nregulations, the facility submitted a plan of correction. During subsequent surveys, Greenbelt was found to still\nhave deficiencies. After three months, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(h)(2)(D), HCFA denied payments for new\nadmissions and imposed civil penalties. Greenbelt was advised that LCA would recommend that its provider\nagreement be terminated if it was not in substantial compliance by July 26, 1998. See Defendant Exhibit 3.\nA survey was conducted in July that found Greenbelt not to be in substantial compliance. Greenbelt submitted\nadditional evidence to LCA claiming that it was in compliance. On July 29, 1998, LCA sent a letter to Greenbelt\naccepting its evidence that it was in compliance. In that letter, LCA stated that it would \"consider that [Greenbelt\nwas] in compliance ... as of July 26, 1998 ... [and would] recommend[] to HCFA that the termination action be\nrescinded and that the civil money penalty and denial of payment for new admissions sanctions cease.\" Plaintiff's\nExhibit 7. The letter also stated that HCFA would advise Greenbelt separately of its decision.\nIn August of 1998, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland and the Office of Inspector\nGeneral for the HHS began an investigation into whether Greenbelt had violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.\n§ 3729. On August 17, 1998 representatives from the U.S. Attorney's Office, LCA and HCFA surveyors visited the\nGreenbelt facility. During this visit, Greenbelt was found to not be in compliance with the Medicare and Medicaid\nprogram requirements.\nAs a result of the August finding, on September 11, 1998, HCFA sent a letter notifying Greenbelt that it was\nterminating its participation in the Medicare program on September 26, 1998. In that letter HCFA stated that:\n\"On July 20, 1998, the Licensing and Certification Administration of the Maryland Department of\nHealth and Mental Hygiene informed us that you had submitted to that state agency satisfactory\nevidence of correction of all the deficiencies remaining when the state agency had last revisited\nyour facility on July 14-17, 1998. We were prepared to accept the conclusion that you had\ncorrected all of your deficiencies, until a member of our staff and a member of the staff of the state\nsurvey agency visited your facility on August 17-18, 1998.\"\n(Plaintiff Exhibit 9.)\nThe letter also stated that Greenbelt had provided evidence in its plan correction which was inaccurate. Further,\nHCFA noted evidence of deficiencies \"that occurred prior to, during and after the July 26, 1998 date upon which\nyou alleged substantial compliance.\" Id. The letter also stated that it concluded that Greenbelt had not \"regained\ncompliance with the Medicare/Medicaid requirements since the survey completed on January 26, 1998.\" Id.\nHCFA claimed its termination was based on 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(h)(2)(C) and 42 C.F.R. § 488.450(c) and (d),\nwhich allow the Secretary to continue to make payments to a facility which is out in compliance for a period of six\nmonths. HCFA informed Greenbelt that it had sixty days to request a hearing before an administrative law judge\n[1]\nof the HHS, Departmental Appeals Board.\n\n567 On September 14, 1998, the United States through the U.S. Attorney Office *567 filed a complaint for injunctive\nrelief on September 14, 1998. United States v. Northern Health Facilities, Inc. d/b/a Greenbelt Nursing &\nRehabilitation Center, et al., Civil Action No. AW 98-3113. It named Greenbelt as one of the defendants. On\nSeptember 15, this Court approved a Preliminary Injunction Order (\"Consent Order\") which was presented to it\nwith the consent of all parties involved. Signatory parties were the United States Attorney for the District of\nMaryland, on behalf of the United States of America, through two of the Assistant United States Attorneys and\ncounsel for the Defendants. Neither the State or HCFA were signatory parties to the Consent Order. Under the\nConsent Order, a Temporary Manager, selected by the United States, was to be hired by Greenbelt, with the\n\"independent authority to hire, terminate or reassign, staff, obligate facility funds, alter facility procedure, and\nmanage the facility to correct all deficiencies identified in Greenbelt.\" (Consent Order at 19.) In addition, a\nFederal Monitor was to be appointed, to \"oversee Greenbelt's compliance with th[e] Order and independently\nassess Greenbelt's compliance with th[e] Order.\" Id. at 20.\nIn one of its provisions, the Consent Order stated:\nDuring the duration of this action and under the terms of this Preliminary Injunction, all federal and\nState regulatory oversight and enforcement obligations shall remain in full effect. All administrative\nremedies, including the authority of the Office of Inspector General to seek exclusion and the\nHealth Care Financing Administration and the State of Maryland to seek termination or other\nadministrative remedies, are preserved and are not supplanted by the terms of the Preliminary\nInjunction ...\n(Consent Order at 3.)\nOn October 5, 1998, Ilene Warner was appointed to be the Temporary Manager of Greenbelt. Warner took steps\nto improve conditions at Greenbelt such as hiring a new medical director and a new Certified Nurse Practitioner.\nOn November 20, 1998, Claudia Schlosberg, staff attorney at the National Health Law Program in Washington,\nD.C. was appointed as the Federal Monitor.\n[2]\nAs a result of HCFA's decision to terminate Greenbelt from the Medicare program , the State notified Greenbelt,\non October 9, 1998, that it would terminate Greenbelt as a Medicaid provider effective October 26, 1998.\nHowever, in an effort to allow Greenbelt to come into compliance under the supervision of the Temporary\nManager, the State continued providing Medicaid payments until December 2, 1998. As of December 2, 1998, all\nfunding to Greenbelt had ceased.\nOn November 10, Greenbelt sought administrative review of HCFA's decision to terminate it from the Medicare\nprogram. The facility also filed an application for Medicaid recertification to the Maryland Medicaid program. On\nNovember 17-19, 1998, a LCA survey of the facility took place. The LCA surveyors found that Greenbelt was still\nnot in substantial compliance. Two weeks later, a HCFA survey team visited the facility (from November 30 00\n97\nDecember 4) and noted additional deficiencies. In all of the surveys to date, the deficiencies have never reached\nthe highest level under the regulations which is \"immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety.\" Most\ndeficiencies were at the \"no actual harm with potential for more than minimal harm that is not immediate\njeopardy\" level.\nOn December 7, 1998, Plaintiff brought the instant suit. Plaintiff sought a court order enjoining the Defendants\nfrom terminating its participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Plaintiff argued that it may have to\n568 close due to the cessation of the payments because the majority *568 of its residents are Medicare recipients.\nPlaintiff maintained that injunctive relief was necessary because of the risk of \"transfer trauma\" to its residents.\nPlaintiff contended that:\nWhen an elderly resident of a nursing home (or any stable environment) is transferred to a new,\nunfamiliar environment and particularly when the transfer is involuntary, he or she may experience\n`transfer trauma.' ... [T]here is a great risk of emotional trauma and impairment of patient function\nand condition if transfers are forced.\n\n(Plaintiff's Memorandum at 23.) Plaintiff provided numerous affidavits from the families of its residents stating that\nGreenbelt is a safe environment, and that a transfer would be a traumatic event for their loved ones.\nPlaintiff further argued that the Defendants would not suffer any harm if the injunctive relief was granted because\nthe Temporary Manager and Federal Monitor were in place to remedy the facility's deficiencies. Plaintiff also\nmaintained that Secretary Shalala decision to terminate its participation was thwarting the efforts of this Court to\nremedy the deficiencies in this manner. Plaintiff contended that the Consent Order was \"consistent with the\nTemporary Management process envisioned by the Social Security Act, and will lead to improving and\nmaintaining the quality of care provided to Greenbelt's residents.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum at 35.\nOn December 9, 1998, the Court held an expedited hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining\nOrder. At the hearing, United States Attorney's Office recused itself from representing the Federal Government in\nthe instant case because of its involvement in the first case. That Office was a signatory to the Consent Order,\nand was responsible for the hiring of the Temporary Manager and the Federal Monitor.\nThe Court heard arguments from counsel for Greenbelt, Secretary Shalala, and for the State. The Court also\nallowed in the limited testimony of the Temporary Manager, Warner, on behalf of the Plaintiff, and Gloria Speller, a\nfederal surveyor, and Carol Benner, Director of the LCA, on behalf of the Defendants. In addition, the Court called\nthe Federal Monitor, Schlosberg.\nWarner testified about the improvements that she was implementing at Greenbelt, including a weekly team to\ncheck resident's wound, and improvement in such areas as restraint reduction and restorative nursing. She\ntestified that because she began working at the facility in early October, she had only six weeks to make these\nimprovements before the survey teams visited. In an affidavit submitted to the Court prior to the hearing, Warner\nstated, \"[i]f the result of the survey process is termination, I will not be able to fulfill the Federal Court's mandate,\nespecially when I do not believe the findings of the federal and state surveyors described by the teams support\nclosure of Greenbelt and the transfer of its residents.\" Warner's Aff. at 4.\nSpeller, who was the lead surveyor on the November 30-December 4 federal survey team, testified about\nnumerous deficiencies that the team had noted during their visit. These deficiencies included evidence of mice\nand mice droppings, dirty rooms, inappropriate wound care treatment, amongst other things.\nBenner testified that the State has an efficient plan under which the residents could be moved without suffering\nfrom \"transfer trauma.\" Benner stated that LCA had closed nine nursing homes, and had moved approximately\ntwo thousand residents. Benner contended that the only incident of potential harm after such a move was that of\nan elderly woman who died the day after she was moved. Benner maintained, however, that there was no proof\nthat this death was attributable to the move. Benner also testified that she believed that there would be a greater\n569 risk for the residents to remain in Greenbelt *569 based on the latest survey findings than there would be to move\nthem.\nSchlosberg testified that it was her general impression that Greenbelt was acting in good faith, and was working\nhard to address its problems. She stated that the facility had a caring staff which was attempting to be honest\nabout the deficiencies that existed at the facility. Schlosberg contended that Greenbelt had not had enough time\nto adequately address these concerns. She testified that continued participation in the Medicare and Medicaid\nprograms was necessary to fulfill the mandate of the Consent Order.\nIn its brief and at the hearing, the Federal Government first argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction to hear this\ncase because the Plaintiff has not exhausted its remedies as Plaintiff is currently seeking administrative review of\nHCFA's decision to terminate. The Federal Government argued that Plaintiff was not seeking to maintain the\nstatus quo. The Federal Government contended that the Plaintiff has not received any benefits from the Federal\nGovernment since it was terminated from the program on September 26, 1998. Further, the Federal Government\nargued that the facts that Plaintiff had not sought expedited review before the administrative law judge and had\nnot asked for this temporary restraining order until three months later reveal that this injunctive relief is not\nneeded immediately, and that there is no threat of irreparable harm. In addition, the Federal Government\ncontended that the harm to itself asserted by the Plaintiff is \"merely financial 00 and plaintiff has not even\n97\n\nattempted to show that either it or its parent company could not possibly sustain plaintiff while its administrative\nappeals are decided.\" Federal Government's Opposition at 3.\nMoreover, the Federal Government contended that Plaintiff was not likely to succeed on the merits of its claim\nbecause it argued that the Secretary had authority to terminate its participation absent a finding of immediate\njeopardy. Further, the Federal Government argued that the Secretary did not have the statutory authority to\ncontinue payments past the six month period described in Section 1395i-3(h)(2)(C). The Federal Government\ncontended that the Secretary could only allow payments to July, which was six months after the initial January\nsurvey which found deficiencies. The Federal Government argued that although Plaintiff claims that it was in\ncompliance in July, further investigation displayed that Greenbelt had made misrepresentations to the agencies\nand that it was not in substantial compliance at that time. Therefore, Defendant argued that the Court cannot\ncompel the Secretary to reinstate Greenbelt because the Secretary does not have the statutory authority to\ncontinue making payments to Greenbelt.\nThe State has argued that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over it because of the Eleventh Amendment\nto the United States Constitution, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The State also contended that the\nEleventh Amendment would bar an order to continue payments to Greenbelt because it states that it has not\nviolated federal law. According to the State, \"[w]ithout HCFA assurances that the federal government will pay the\nfederal share, the State is under no continuing obligation to pay for services.\" Opposition of the State at 13.\nBoth of the Defendants have argued that the resurveys conducted by a State survey team in mid-November and\nby a Federal survey team in the first week of December revealed that not only was Greenbelt not in substantial\ncompliance with the regulations, but, in fact, deficiencies found were worse than they had been in the original\nsurvey in January. Both maintained that the risk of transfer trauma to Greenbelt residents is a lesser risk of harm\nto them than that of remaining in the facility. Therefore, they contended that Greenbelt cannot meet the standards\nfor issuing injunctive relief.\n570  III\n*570\nJurisdiction\nBefore turning to the merits of Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, this Court first must determine\nwhether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff has asserted that the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343 and 1361, and 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). Defendants maintain that the Court does not have\njurisdiction because it has not exhausted its administrative remedies as it is required to by pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 405(g) and (h), as incorporated into the Medicare statute by Section 1395ii. Plaintiff contends its claims\nrepresent a collateral attack on the Secretary's decision to terminate and therefore exhaustion is not required.\n\"The Supreme Court has recognized that `cases may arise where a claimant's interest in having a particular\nissue resolved promptly is so great that deference to the agency's judgment is inappropriate .' ... [T]o be excused\nfrom the exhaustion requirement, Plaintiff must show that: (1) the suit involves a collateral attack rather than one\non the merits; and (2) its interest in prompt judicial review is so compelling that deference to the agency's\ndetermination is inappropriate.\" Lake County Rehabilitation Center, Inc. v. Shalala, 854 F.Supp. 1329, 1335-36\n(N.D.Ind. 1994) (citations omitted). This Court finds that Plaintiff has met these requirements. Plaintiff's claims do\nnot require the Court to address the substance of the Secretary's decision. The Court is not asked to evaluate\nHCFA factual findings as to the deficiencies, or whether Greenbelt was actually out of compliance with the\nregulations. Rather, Plaintiff claims are a collateral attack addressing the scope of the Secretary's power under\nthe Medicare Act. Furthermore, Plaintiff has argued that without funding, it will have to close. This is a showing\nthat its interest in prompt judicial review is compelling. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met the\nrequirements for waiver of the exhaustion requirement, and that the Court has jurisdiction to hear the claims\nmade against the Federal Government.\nThe State has also argued that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case. The State maintains that \"[a]ny order\ndirecting the Secretary of the Department to pay for the continued operation of Greenbelt would be an order\n\nagainst the State of Maryland.\" State's Opposition at 9-10. Further, the State argues that it has not consented to\nbe sued, and Congress has not clearly and unequivocally expressed an intent to abrogate its sovereign immunity\nin the Medicaid statute. See Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d\n252 (1996). The State notes that Congress repealed a statutory provision that expressly required the states to\nwaive any Eleventh Amendment immunity, and argues that \"[n]o more compelling evidence could demonstrate\nthe lack of congressional intent to abrogate sovereign immunity.\" Opposition of the State at 11. The State also\nargues that the Supreme Court held in Seminole that Congress's Article I powers \"cannot be used to circumvent\nthe Constitutional limitations placed on federal jurisdiction.\" Id. at 72, 116 S.Ct. 1114. As the Medicaid Act was\nenacted under Congress's Article I spending powers, the State argues that Congress did not have the power to\nabrogate its immunity.\nPlaintiff has argued that the doctrine of sovereign immunity and Eleventh Amendment concerns are not\nimplicated in this case, because although it is seeking money from the State treasury in terms of continued\npayments, it is not seeking money damages. Plaintiff argues that the Court does have jurisdiction over the State\nbecause the State is a joint participant in the Medicaid program, which is established under federal law. Plaintiff\nstates that an individual has a right to pursue injunctive relief against a state official to ensure that the official is\n571 complying with federal law. See id. at 71 n. 14, 72 n. 16, 116 S.Ct. 1114. *571 Finally, Plaintiff notes that the\nSupreme Court stated in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass'n, that the repeal of the waiver provision in the Medicaid\nAct was not to \"`be construed as in any way contravening or constraining the rights of the providers of Medicaid\nservices, the State Medicaid agencies, or the Department to seek prospective, injunctive relief in a federal or\nstate judicial forum.'\" 496 U.S. 498, 517, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990) (citing S.Rep. No. 94-1240,\nReprinted in 1976 USCCAN at 5651).\nThe Court finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff's claims because it is seeking prospective injunctive relief.\nThe Court believes, however, that the State's obligation to make Medicare payments is derivative. See 42 C.F.R.\n§§ 488.450(d), 488.452(e); COMAR 10.910.29 Therefore, if the Court finds that the Federal Government cannot\nbe compelled to reinstate the payments, the Court will also find that the State cannot be so compelled.\nIV\nStandards for Injunctive Relief\nThe standards for injunctive relief in the Fourth Circuit are well known. In Blackwelder Furniture Co. of Statesville,\nInc. v. Seilig Manuf. Co., Inc., 550 F.2d 189 (4th Cir.1977), the Fourth Circuit explained that the most important\nfactors a district court must consider in deciding whether to grant injunctive relief are the threat of irreparable\nharm to the plaintiff should the Court not issue an injunction, and the likely harm to the defendant if an injunction\nis ordered. See id. at 196. The district court's first task is to balance these two factors. See Manning v. Hunt, 119\nF.3d 254, 263 (4th Cir.1997). After doing this balancing, the court may then consider the third factor, which is the\nplaintiff's likelihood of success. See id. As the balance of harm moves in favor the defendant, the plaintiff has a\ngreater burden in showing its likelihood of success. See id. Finally, the Court considers the fourth factor, the\npublic interest. See id.\nV\nAnalysis\nThe balance of the hardships seems to be in Plaintiff's favor. If Plaintiff does not receive the monies from the\nFederal and State agencies there is a real possibility of irreparable harm: the facility may have to close. The\nFederal Government has argued that Plaintiff has not shown that it does not have the financial ability to remain\nopen without the funding. However, as 90% of its residents receive Medicaid benefits, it is reasonable to assume\nthat the cessation of payments will result in closure of the facility. Furthermore, all of the parties have\n\nacknowledged that there is a risk that the facility's residents will suffer \"transfer trauma\" resulting in severe\npsychological, emotional, and physical damage due to this closure.\nThe possibility of harm to the Defendants is not as great. Both agencies have argued that residents might suffer\nmore harm if they remain in Greenbelt than if they were removed from the facility. None of the deficiencies,\nhowever, found by the surveyors have met the level in which they would be categorized as immediately\njeopardizing the health or safety of Greenbelt's residents. Therefore, although the Defendants may have a\ngeneralized concern about the welfare of the residents, they have not shown a likelihood of harm to them if the\ninjunction is ordered.\nThe Court now considers the third factor in the hardship balancing test: plaintiff's likelihood of success on the\nmerits. When \"the balance [of the hardships] `tips decidedly' in favor of the plaintiff ... a preliminary injunction will\nbe granted if `the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful,\nas to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.'\" Rum Creek Coal Sales. Inc.\n572 v. Caperton, 926 F.2d 353, 359 (4th *572 Cir.1991) (citing Blackwelder, 550 F.2d at 195). Plaintiff has not done so\nin the instant case.\nPlaintiff challenges the Secretary Shalala's authority under the Medicare Act to terminate the facility's\nparticipation in the Medicare program. The statutory provisions, found at 42 U.S.C. § 1395(I)-3(h), which\ndelineate the powers of the Secretary in this matter state:\n(1) In general\nIf a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection\n(g)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a skilled nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of\nsubsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and further finds that the facility's deficiencies 00\n97\n(A) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall recommend to the\nSecretary that the Secretary take such action as described in paragraph (2)(A)(I); or\n(B) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State may recommend\nto the Secretary that the Secretary take such action as described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii).\nIf a State finds that a skilled nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d)\nof this section, but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may\nrecommend a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the\nfacility was not in compliance with such requirements.\n(2) Secretarial authority\n(A) In general\nWith respect to any skilled nursing facility in a State, if the Secretary finds, or pursuant to a\nrecommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility no longer\nmeets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, and further finds that the\nfacility's deficiencies 00\n97\n(I) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate\naction to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in\nsubparagraph (B)(iii), or terminate the facility's participation under this subchapter and may\nprovide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in subparagraph (B); or\n(ii) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary may impose\nany of the remedies described in subparagraph (B).\nNothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the\nSecretary to remedy a skilled nursing facility's deficiencies. If the Secretary finds, or pursuant to\nthe recommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility meets\n\nsuch requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary\nmay provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (B)(ii) for the days on which he finds\nthat the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.\n(B) Specified remedies\nThe Secretary may take the following actions with respect to a finding that a facility has not met an\napplicable requirement:\n(I) Denial of payment\nThe Secretary may deny any further payments under this subchapter with respect to all individuals\nentitled to benefits under this subchapter in the facility or with respect to such individuals admitted\nto the facility after the effective date of the finding.\n(ii) Authority with respect to civil money penalties\n573 The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed *573 $10,000 for\neach day of noncompliance. The provisions of section 1320a-7a of this title (other than\nsubsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the\nsame manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a-7a(a) of\nthis title.\n(iii) Appointment of temporary management\nIn consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the\noperation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility's residents, where there\nis a need for temporary management while 00\n97\n(I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or\n(II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements\nof subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.\nThe temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until\nthe Secretary has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued\ncompliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d).\nThe Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied,\nthe amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition\nof such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the\nidentification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition\nof incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the\nSecretary may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.\n(C) Continuation of payments pending remediation\nThe Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months after the\neffective date of the findings, under this subchapter with respect to a skilled nursing facility not in\ncompliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, if 00\n97\n(I) the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure\ncompliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility,\n(ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval\nand the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and\n\n(iii) the facility agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this\nsubparagraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and\ntimetable.\nThe Secretary shall establish guidelines for approval of corrective actions requested by States\nunder this subparagraph.\n(D) Assuring prompt compliance\nIf a skilled nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c),\nand (d) of this section, within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance\nwith such requirements, the Secretary shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (B)(I)\nfor all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.\nPlaintiff contends that these provisions establish that the Secretary can only terminate a facility's participation\nunder the Medicare program when there has been a finding that the deficiencies cited immediately jeopardize the\nhealth and safety of its residents. The Secretary, however, has adopted regulations which provide that HCFA or\nthe State may terminate a facility's provider agreement absent a finding of immediate jeopardy. See 42 C.F.R. §\n488.412, 488.456.\n574 *574 The Medicaid provisions mostly parallel Medicare provisions. However, as Medicaid is a joint program, the\nMedicaid Act also address the authority of the State to remedy deficiencies. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(h):\n(1) In general\nIf a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection\n(g)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of\nsubsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and further finds that the facility's deficiencies 00\n97\n(A) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall take immediate\naction to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in\nparagraph (2)(A)(iii), or terminate the facility's participation under the State plan and may provide,\nin addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in paragraph (2); or\n(B) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State may 00\n97\n(I) terminate the facility's participation under the State plan,\n(ii) provide for one or more of the remedies described in paragraph (2), or\n(iii) do both....\nTherefore, it is clear that the State has the authority to terminate the facility participation even absent a finding of\nimmediate jeopardy. Plaintiff, however is not directly challenging the State's authority to terminate participation,\n[3]\nbut that of the Secretary of HHS. Ultimately, the issue before the Court is one of statutory interpretation.\nFour courts have looked at this issue while deciding whether to grant injunctive relief. One court declined to reach\nthe issue because it found that the facts in that case indicated that the plaintiff was likely to be reinstated. See \nLibbie Rehabilitation Center, Inc. v. Shalala, 26 F.Supp.2d 128 (D.D.C.1998). Two of those courts found that the\nSecretary was acting outside of the statutory authority granted to her because they held that the statute only\nallowed the Secretary to terminate a facility from the programs when there had been a finding of immediate\njeopardy. See Mountainview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Inc. v. Department of Health and Human\nServices, No. 93 CV 1692 (M.D.Pa. Nov. 18, 1993); Claridge House, Inc. v. Department of Health and Human\nServices, 795 F.Supp. 1393 (S.D.Ohio 1991). One court has found that the Secretary has the authority to\nterminate absent such a finding. Lake County, 854 F.Supp. at 1340. The Court believes that this latter court\nreached the correct result.\n\nAlthough the Claridge House court found that \"if the Secretary could terminate a facility with or without a finding\nof immediate jeopardy, there would be little point in distinguishing ... between situations of immediate jeopardy\nand situations of no immediate jeopardy,\" an examination of the statutory language reveals the purpose for the\ndistinction. 795 F.Supp. at 1404. As the Lake County court has noted, if the Secretary finds a facility's deficiencies\nrise to the level of immediately jeopardizing its resident's health, Congress has mandated that the Secretary\n\"shall\" either terminate the facilities participation or appoint a temporary manager. See854 F.Supp. at 1340. The\nonly discretion that the Secretary has in this situation is which of the two avenues offered by Congress to pursue\n575 under the given circumstances. If *575 the deficiencies do not rise to this severe level, however, the Secretary\n\"may\" choose from the three remedies specified in Section 1395i-3(h)(2)(B). The statutory language does not\nrequire the Secretary to choose one of these remedies. Instead, the provision clearly states that \"[n]othing in this\nsubparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a skilled\nnursing facilities deficiencies.\" Section 1395i-3(h)(2)(A).\nAlthough courts have disagreed on the interpretation of Section 1395i-3(h), this Court finds this reading to be the\nmost in line with Congress' intent as expressed in the legislative history. Prior to 1987, HCFA could only either\nterminate a facility's participation or deny payments if that facility was found to not be in substantial compliance\nwith the Medicare or Medicaid participation requirements. In 1987, however, Congress amended the Social\nSecurity Act to include the intermediate remedies such as the denial of payments for future residents, the\nimposition of civil penalties, and the appointment of a temporary manager. \"[T]here is no indication in the\nlegislative history of the statute that Congress wished to limit the Secretary's ability to terminate a facility from\nparticipation in the Medicare program.\" Lake County, 854 F.Supp. at 1340. Rather, the Committee reports\nindicate that Congress intended to expand the remedies available. See H.R.Rep. No. 291(I), 100th Congress, 1st\nSess., Reprinted in 1987 USCCAN 2313-1, 2313-295.\nThe legislative history supports an interpretation that the distinction drawn between deficiencies which\nimmediately jeopardize the health and safety of the facility's residents and those that do not was not based on the\nSecretary's authority to terminate a facility's participation. The Committee report states that if the \"deficiencies\nimmediately jeopardize the health and safety of its residents, the Secretary would be required to follow one of two\ncourses of action.\" Id. (emphasis added). On the other hand, the Committee stated, if the deficiencies did not rise\nto that level, \"the Secretary could, in addition to any other remedies available to the Secretary under law, exercise\none or more of three specified intermediate remedies.\" Id.\nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2), \"[t]he Secretary may ... refuse to renew or may terminate such an agreement\nafter the Secretary 00 (A) has determined that the provider fails to comply substantially with the provisions of the\n97\nagreement, with the provisions of this subchapter and regulations thereunder ...\" This provision, which does not\nrequire a finding of immediate jeopardy, was a remedy available to the Secretary at the time the statute was\namended. Therefore, it is clear that the Secretary has the statutory authority to terminate a facility's participation\neven absent a finding of immediate jeopardy, and the regulations which so state are consistent with the statutory\n[4]\nprovisions. Thus, Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim.\n576 *576 The Court believes that the public interest would be served if the facility was allowed to correct its\ndeficiencies within the time frame allotted by the Consent Order approved by this Court. Although the balance of\nthe other factors of the hardship balancing test might be in Plaintiff's favor, the Court cannot grant this\nextraordinary relief in light of the fact that Plaintiff is not likely to succeed on the merits of its complaint.\nNor can the Court find any equitable reasons to reach a different result. The doctrine of estoppel, under which\nHCFA could be bound by September 15 Consent Order is inapplicable. \"[E]stoppel is rarely if ever, [invoked]\nagainst the Government absent proof of some affirmative misconduct by a Government agent.\" United States v.\nVanhorn, 20 F.3d 104, 112 n. 9 (4th Cir.1994). That has not been shown in this case.\nAs discussed in footnote 4, supra, the United States Attorney Office is not an agent of HCFA, and HCFA was not\na signatory party of the Consent Order. Plaintiff maintains that \"in light of the entry of the Consent Order imposing\nthe federal operation of the facility under the temporary Manager and Monitor only days after HCFA issued its\ntermination notice, Greenbelt had every reason to believe that this comprehensive remediation of the problems at\nthe facility would enable it to maintain its status in the federal and state entitlement programs.\" Plaintiff's Reply at\n\n577 4. Nothing, however, indicates *577 that an agent from HCFA ever represented to Greenbelt that HCFA was not\ngoing to terminate it on September 26, 1998, as it was informed it would be by the September 11, 1998 letter.\nFurther, the language of the Consent Order clearly states that all administrative remedies were not supplanted by\nits terms. Therefore, there is not any evidence of affirmative misconduct on the part of a HCFA agent, and\nestoppel cannot apply.\nAlthough the Court is compelled to reach the conclusion that Secretary Shalala through HCFA had the authority\nto terminate Greenbelt's participation in the Medicare program, the Court wishes to express its concerns about\nthe fairness of this action. The Court believes that this is an inequitable result. From all indications, Greenbelt\nentered into the Consent Order in good faith. The Temporary Manager and the Federal Monitor have just recently\nbegun the work necessary to correct the deficiencies cited by the respective agencies. Although the agencies\nargue that the conditions at Greenbelt have become worse, not better, since January, the Court believes that the\nTemporary Manager has not had sufficient time to address the problems. The Federal Monitor has taken the\nposition that \"[e]ffectuation of the termination virtually shuts down the facility only weeks after the temporary\nmanager's appointment, compelling the involuntary discharge of all the residents and shutting down the remedial\nprocess put in place by the court's order .[She] firmly believes that facility closure is not in the best interests of\nGreenbelt's residents ....\" December 9, 1998 Letter from Federal Monitor Claudia Schlosberg at 2. The Court is\ninclined to agree.\nPlaintiff has argued that \"Greenbelt and its residents are caught in a conflict between competing Governmental\nobjectives which they cannot control.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum at 39. The Court agrees with this proposition. This\nconflict was displayed by the fact that the United States Attorney was compelled to recuse herself from this case.\nUnfortunately for Greenbelt, however, the Court does not agree with the proposition that \"[t]he notion that\nsomehow there is a `different' United States or federal involved in this action than the agency involved in the\nrelated case is an absurdity. ...\" Plaintiffs Reply at 9. It is clear that two different arms of the Federal Government,\nwith two different views on how Greenbelt's programs should be addressed, were involved in these cases. As\nHCFA had the authority to terminate, and the Office of the Attorney General did not have the power to bind HCFA\nto the provisions of the Consent Order, Plaintiff cannot receive its requested relief.\nTherefore, the Court will deny Plaintiff's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, without prejudice to the\nPlaintiff's seeking a hearing on its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, after it has exhausted its administrative\nremedies, or at another time should any circumstance arise which would warrant that relief.\n[1] Plaintiff appealed within the sixty days provided. Since very few of its residents receive care reimbursed under\nMedicare Part A, Greenbelt has borne the cost of providing these services since the termination.\n[2] \"Termination from Medicaid is automatic upon termination from Medicare.\" International Long Term Care, Inc.\nv. Shalala, 947 F.Supp. 15, 16 (D.D.C.1996).\n[3] Plaintiff's challenge in this case is primarily to the Secretary's decision to terminate its participation in the\nMedicare program. Although this decision necessarily had an impact on Plaintiff's participation in the Medicaid\nprogram, the HCFA did not reference the Medicaid act in its letter to Plaintiff. Therefore, the Court must determine\nwhether the Secretary had the statutory authority to terminate under the Medicare provisions found in Section\n1395i-3(h).\n[4] The Federal Government also argued that not only does the Secretary have the authority to terminate the\nprovider agreement at any time that a facility is found not to be in substantial compliance with the participation\nrequirements, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 requires the Secretary to terminate the provider agreement if the facility is not\nfound to be in compliance after six months. See 42 C.F.R. § 488.412 (\"HCFA terminates the provider agreement\nfor SNF's and NF's ... for a NF for which participation was continued under paragraph (a) of this section, if the\nfacility is not in substantial compliance within 6 months of the last day of the survey.\"); see also 42 C.F.R. §\n488.450(d). Plaintiff argued that it had been recertified within this six month period. Plaintiff maintained that \"[w]ith\nthe acceptance of the plan of correction by HCFA, the survey cycle would end (until the next survey by the LCA\nor a federal survey agency) and the facility would be entitled to the intervening period to continue its corrective\nmeasures.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum at 15. Plaintiff relied on LCA's July 29, 1988 letter stating that it would\n\nconsider the facility to be in compliance and ¶ 23 of the Complaint in the first case, which states that HCFA\naccepted the plan of correction in its argument that it was certified as of July 26, 1998. HCFA argued, however,\nthat it ever accepted the plan of correction because the August survey occurred before HCFA acted on LCA's\nrecommendations. See Federal Government's Opposition at 5. \nAlthough LCA could recommend that Greenbelt be considered in compliance, LCA did not have the power to bind\nHCFA to that recommendation. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396r (h)(6)(B) (\"If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has\nnot met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that the failure does not\nimmediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, but the State has not made such a finding, the\nSecretary ... may impose any remedies specified in paragraph (3)(C) with respect to the facility ...\") Moreover, the\nUnited States Attorney Office, not HCFA, was the signatory to the Consent Order. The United States Attorney\nOffice also cannot be seen as an agent of HCFA. Nothing indicates that an agent from HCFA ever represented to\nGreenbelt that it was considered to be in compliance in July. Therefore, Plaintiff's argument that a new cycle had\nbegun must fail.\nPlaintiff further argued that even if the six month time period had elapsed, despite 42 C.F.R. § 488.412, HCFA is\nnot required to terminate a facility's participation by 42 U.S.C. § 1395i(h)(3)(C). Section 1395i-3(h)(2)(C) does not\nexpressly mention termination. The provision merely states that the Secretary can continue payments for a six\nmonth period. Nothing in this language indicates that Secretary could not simply deny payments, instead of\nterminating the facility's participation in the program, after this six month period. Denial of payments, however,\nwould probably lead to the same result in this case as termination. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1396r (h)(1)(B), the State\ncould terminate the facility's participation without a finding of immediate jeopardy. Thus, even if HCFA had merely\ndenied funding, the State would not have been under any legal obligation to continue paying Greenbelt for the\nservices rendered to its residents on Medicaid.\nPlaintiff argued, however, HCFA had the authority to continue payments beyond the six month period. Plaintiff\nmaintained that a \"review of the statutory provisions and legislative history creating intermediate remedies such\nas temporary management generally and the particular invocation of that remedy in this case, demonstrate the\ninaccuracy\" of HCFA's position that it cannot continue payments. Plaintiff's Reply at 7. Plaintiff claimed that the\ntemporary management provision would be rendered meaningless if HCFA is required to cease funding at the\nend of six months because no such time limit is imposed in that provision. A Temporary Manager may need more\nthan six months to get the facility into compliance, and the cessation of funding during that time period would\nhinder the Temporary Manager's progress. The Court agrees that a reasonable interpretation of Section 1395i-3\n(h)(2)(C) in conjunction with Section 1395i-3(h)(B)(iii) would be that the Secretary can continue funding past six\nmonth to a facility if the temporary management alternative is employed. However, as the Court finds that HCFA\ndid not choose to use this intermediate remedy, the Secretary was not required to fund beyond the six months\nperiod detailed in Section 1395i-3(h)(2)(C).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

SUMMARY OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n3. The United States is currently investigating allegations of federal law violations in connection with health care\nservices rendered to nursing home residents at Greenbelt. The allegations involve the systemic denial of care,\n691 including but not limited to: *691 medical care, misuse of psychotropic and anti-depressant medication, systemic\nfailure to provide minimal standards of care guaranteed by law, and the submission of false claims to obtain\npayment from the United States to which Greenbelt is not entitled. The investigation is ongoing. On or about\nSeptember 14, 1998, the United States filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief, seeking preliminary injunctive relief\npending the investigation to ensure that during the investigation the residents received all necessary and\nappropriate care guaranteed by law.\n\n4. The United States and Greenbelt agree to the terms of the Preliminary Injunction as set forth herein\n(sometimes hereinafter referred to as Order or Consent Order).\nD. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n5. In entering into this Preliminary Injunction voluntarily and by consent, Greenbelt does not admit to any violation\nof law and the Parties agree that this Order may not be used as evidence of liability in any other proceeding,\nincluding any trial on the merits of this pending action. Greenbelt further preserves and does not waive any legal\ndefense to the allegations asserted in this action and disputes the factual allegations.\n6. During the duration of this action and under the terms of this Preliminary Injunction, all federal and State\nregulatory oversight and enforcement obligations shall remain in full effect. All administrative remedies, including\nthe authority of the Office of Inspector General to seek exclusion and the Health Care Financing Administration\nand the State of Maryland to seek termination or other administrative remedies, are preserved and are not\nsupplanted by the terms of the Preliminary Injunction, except as modified by agreement of the Parties or this\nCourt.\n7. This Preliminary Injunction is legally binding and judicially enforceable by the Parties and it shall be applicable\nto and binding upon all of the parties, their officers, agents, employees, assigns, and successors. All reports,\nverifications and notices required to be submitted to the Parties by this Order shall be made directly to the United\nStates Attorney's Office and the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health & Human Services and\ncounsel for Greenbelt.\nE.

Greenbelt's submission of plans of correction and/or certifications of compliance by the Health Care Financing\nAdministration does not in and of itself constitute compliance with this Preliminary Injunction, nor does a cited\ndeficiency by state or federal surveyors establish noncompliance with this Preliminary Injunction. Findings of the\nMonitor provided under this Order do not, in and of themselves, constitute deficiencies by federal or State\nsurveyors.\n692 10. If Greenbelt seeks to add a policy, procedure or protocol which addresses resident *692 care issues or to\nmodify a policy, or procedure or protocol which has been attached to and incorporated into this Consent Order,\nGreenbelt shall first submit any proposed new or modified policy, procedure or protocol to the United States and\nthe Monitor as defined in paragraph 44-48(u) for review.

The United States or the Monitor may provide Greenbelt with comments or recommendations regarding the\nproposed new or modified protocol within ten (10) days of receipt of the proposed modification.\n\n12. If the United States or the Monitor do not submit any comments or recommendations, the Greenbelt shall\nsubmit the new or modified policy, procedure or protocol to the Court as an agreed-upon modification of the\nPreliminary Injunction.\n13.

If Greenbelt declines to adopt the recommendations or\ncomments of the United States or the Monitor, they shall so notify, in writing, the United States and the Monitor,\nand the parties and the Monitor shall confer within ten (10) days.\n14. If the Parties reach an agreement to add or modify the Preliminary Injunction, the Parties shall submit the new\nor modified policy, procedure or protocol as an agreed upon exhibit or amendment to this Order, subject to the\napproval of the Court. If the Parties do not reach agreement, Greenbelt may seek addition or modification of the\npolicy, procedure or protocol with the Court and the United States may present its objections.\n15.

The Nursing Home Reform /  ct mandates that nursing facilities such as\nGreenbelt  comply with federal requirements relating to the provision of services.  42 U.S.C.\n§ l396r(b).  Specifically, in terms of the quality of life for residents of nursing facilities, the\nAct states that \"a nursing facility must care for its residents in such a manner and in\nsuch an environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life\nof each resident.\"  42 U.S.C. § l396r(b)(l)(A).\n7.  The Nursing Home Reform Act further mandates that a nursing facility\n\"provide services and activities to attain or maintain the highest practical physical,\nmental and psychological well-being of each resident in accordance with a written plan\nof care which -– (A) describes the medical, nursing, and psychological meeds of the\nresidents and how such needs will be met;...\"  42 U.S.C. § l396r(b)(2)(A).\n8. The Nursing Home Reform Act imposes a duty upon the nursing facility to\nfulfill the resident's care plans by providing, or arranging for the provision of, among other\nthings, nursing and related services and medically-related  social services that attain or\nmaintain  the highest  practical  physical,  mental,  and psychological  well-being  of each\nresident, as well as pharmaceutical services, therapy services  and dietary services to meet\nthe nutritional and special dietary needs of each resident.  42 U.S.C. § l396r(4)(A)(I-iv).\n9.  The Medicare Program is a health insurance program for individuals 65\nyears and older, certain disabled individuals under age 65, and people of any age who have\n\npermanent kidney failure.  The Medicare statute is codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1395 (Title XVIII\nof the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 483.1 et sea).\n10. The Medicaid Program is a joint federal-state program funded under Title\nXIX of the Social Security Act. The Maryland Department of Mental Health & Hygiene\n('MDHMH\")  administers the Medicaid Program in Maryland. Its subagency, the Licensing\nand Certification Administration, oversees participation requirements in addition to State\nlicensing regulations. As a prerequisite to enrollment as a provider in the Medicaid Program,\nlong-term care facilities are required to enter into provider agreements and agree to, among\nother things, comply with federal and State provider participation requirements as a condition\nof federal and State funding.\n11.  The Social Security Act  mandates that long term care nursing facilities\nthat participate in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, meet certain specific requirements\nin order to qualify for such participation.  These requirements are set forth at 42 C.F.R. §\n483.1 et seg.  and \"serve as the basis for survey activities for the purpose of determining\nwhether a facility meets the requirements of participation in Medicare and Medicaid.  42\nU.S.C. § 483.1. Compliance with these requirements are a condition of federal funding and\nmandate that a facility will provide basic services enumerated in 42 C.F.R.§483.1 et seq.,\nincluding  quality of care necessary  \"to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical,\nmental, and psychosocial well being....\"42 C.F.R.§ 483.25.\n\n12.  The Nursing Home Reform  Act also mandates that the State shall be\nresponsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted by the State, the compliance\nof  nursing  facilities.  The  Secretary  of  the  MDHMH  is responsible  for  certifying  the\ncompliance of State nursing facilities  with the requirements of the requirements  of the\nNursing Home Reform Act.  42 U.S.C. § l396r(g)(l)(A).\nTHE GREENBELT SURVEYS\n13.  On or about January 20, 21, 22, 23, and 26, 1998, the MDHMH, through\nthe Licensing and Certification Administration, conducted an annual survey (the \"January\nSurvey\")  at  Greenbelt  to  determine  if  the  facility  was  in  compliance  with  Federal\nparticipation requirements for nursing homes participating in the Medicare and/or Medicaid\nPrograms. The January Survey found that Greenbelt  was not in substantial compliance with\nFederal and State participation requirements and noted deficiencies involving substandard\ncare.\n14.  On or about February 6, 1998, the MDHMH advised Greenbelt  that the\nfacility's noncompliance constituted substandard quality of care as defined at § 488.301, §§\nl8l9(g)(5)(C) and l9l9(g)(5)(C) of the Social Security Act, and 42 C.F.R. 488.325(h) .\n15. As a result of its noncomplianwe, the MDHMH advised Greenbelt  of its\nobligations to submit a plan of correction with 10 days and that the facility had three months\nto achieve substantial compliance within three months of the last survey date, April 26, 1998.\n\n16. Greenbelt Nursing Center subsequently r·dvised the MDHMH that it was\nin substantial compliance as of March 26, 1998.\n17. On or about April 8. 9, 10. and 24. 1998. the MDHMH revisited Greenbelt\nand conducted  another survey (the \"April Survey\") to verify  that the facility  had. as it\ncertified,  achieved and maintained compliance with the deficiencies  cited in the January\nSurvey.\n18. On or about May 4, 1998, the MDHMH advised Greenbelt  that, contrary\nit its certification, the facility was not in substantial compliance with the requirements for\nparticipation.  As a  result of its noncompliance, the MDHMH again advised Greenbelt\nNursing Center of its obligations to submit a plan of correction with 10 days and that the\nfacility had until July 26, 1998  to achieve substantial compliance.  MDHMH proposed\nsignificant daily fines in connection with the survey deficiencies.\n19.  On or about May  13, 1998, the federal agency charge with regulatory\noversight of long term care facilities, the Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA:'),\nadvised Greenbelt  that, as a result of its numerous deficiencies noted in the January and\nApril Surveys and its subsequent failure to achieve substantial compliance, Greenbelt  no\nlonger met the requirements for participation as a provider of services under the Medicare\nand Medicaid Programs.  As a  result of the January and April Surveys' findings, HCFA\nadvised Greenbelt that payments for all new admissions to the facility would be denied\neffective June 4, 1998. HCFA also advised Greenbelt Nursing Center that if it remained out\n\nof compliance, its provider agreement would be terminated on July 26, 1998. Pursuant to its\nlawful authority and based upon the recommendations of MDHMH. HCFA also imposed a\ncivil money penalty (\"CMP\") in the amount of $700.00 per day effective January 26. 1998\nand continuing up until the date the facility  made the necessary  corrections to achieve\nsubstantial compliance with the participation requirements.\n20.  On or about June 4, 5, 8, 9, and  10, 1998, the MDHMH conducted a\nsecond revisit at Greenbelt  and found that the facility was still not in substantial compliance\nwith participation requirements and that the facility was continuing to provide substandard\nquality of care.  The MDHMH advised the facility on or about June 26, 1998 that it was\nrecommending to HCFA that the CMP be increased to $1,200.00 per day effective June 10,\n1998 to reflect continued noncompliance.  The MDHMH also advised Greenbelt  that it\nwould recommend to the Director of the Maryland Medical Assistance Policy Administration\nthat the facility's provider agreement be terminated effective July 26, 1998 if compliance was\nnot achieved prior to that date.\n21.  On or about July 14 through 17, 1998, the MDHMH revisited Greenbelt\nand noted continued deficiencies.\n22.  On or about July 24, 1998, Greenbelt  certified that it was in substantial\ncompliance with participation requiremems by submitting to MDHMH a certification  of\ncompliance  together  with  a  substantial  plan  of  correction.  Greenbelt  supported  its\n\ncertification  of  compliance  with  numerous  written  presentations  of  new  policies  and\nprotocols to address the deficiencies cited by MDHMH.\n23.  As a result of Greenbelt's certification of compliance and representations\nregarding a plan of correction, on or about July 29. 1998. the MDHMH advised Greenbelt\nthat it would recommend to  HCFA that the  contemplated termination action be rescinded\nbased on the Greenbelt's July  24, 1998 certification that it had achieved compliance. HCFA\naccepted the recommendation to withdraw the termination action and accepted Greenbelt's\nwaiver of appeal of the civil monetary penalty action. The fine due under the administrative\naction was discounted 35% due to the waiver of appeal rights and amounts to approximately\n$80,000.\n24.  After  the  July  1998  certification  of  compliance  by  Greenbelt,  an\ninvestigation undertaken by the United States Attorney's Office  and the Department of\nHealth and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (OIG), into Greenbelt's systemic\nnoncompliance with participation requirements continued.  On August 17, 1998, the Office\nof Inspector General served a subpoena on Greenbelt and invoked its inspection authority.\nAt the request of the U.S. Attorney's Office, and pursuant to statutory federal and State\nauthority, MDHMH state surveyors also conducted an interim site visit to verify compliance.\nA HCFA surveyor participated in the intenm site visit in a monitoring capacity.\n10\n\n25.  The  August  17,  1998  site  visit  at  Greenbelt  revealed  evidence  that\nGreenbelt was not in compliance with program requirements as represented in July 1998 and\nthat there continue to exist serious care deficiencies that have the potential for actual harm.\nThe results of the DOJ-OIG investigation has established  that Greenbelt¯s July 24. 1998\ncertification was false, that the facility remained out of compliance despite certification to\nthe contrary, and that the care provided at the facility continued the evidence a systemic\ndenial of care.\nSUMMARY OF CARE DEFICIENCIES\n26.  The nature of the care deficiencies identified by MDHMH through the\nsurvey process and by the government through its investigation  involve numerous and\nsystemic instances of inadequate medical care resulting in actual harm to residents or having\nthe potential for actual harm. Most of the care deficiencies involve a failure of medical staff\nto intervene in the changing medical condition of residents, failure to notify  physicians\ntimely of medical issues, the failure of physicians or the facility Medical Director to respond\nto nursing staff  requests for physician and other medical  assistance, failure to administer\nand monitor medications properly, failure to assess nutritional needs of residents and to\nprovide appropriate wound care. The government's investigation identifies other areas of\nconcern regarding the excessive use of contraci employees, employee training and morale\nissues that affect the delivery of services to the residents, communication with attending\nphysicians and other health care providers. Additional concerns have been raised regarding\nli\n\ncomplete and accurate documentation in the medical records and the overall morale of staff\nand residents.\n27.  The August  17, 1998 inspection uncovered continued instances of the\nfailure to provide basic levels of medical care to the residents of the facility, including, but\nnot limited to: the inappropriate administration of medication dosage; delay in notifying a\nphysician  for  eight  (8) hours  of  change  in  resident's  condition;  failure  to  administer\nhypertension medication for a week; failure to identify  that a resident was receiving two\ndifferent  and  inconsistent  antibiotics; delay  of over three  (3) weeks  in  scheduling  an\nopthamology consultation for a resident with soreness and redness in both eyes; and, delay\nin notifying a physician of change of condition of a resident with  stasis ulcers, who was\nadmitted to the hospital for treatment.  The deficiencies found on August 17, 1998 are the\nsame type and nature of those deficiencies identified in prior surveys.\n28.  The Unites States contends that Greenbelt's submission of claims for\npayment to the federally-funded Medicare and Medicaid programs from at least January 1998\nto  August  1998, violated  the  False  Claims  Act,  in  that  the  claims  submitted  falsely\nrepresented compliance with all conditions for payment guaranteed under the Nursing Home\nReform Act. The United States specifically  contends that the July  1998 certification  of\ncompliance to avoid federal  funding termination constitutes a  claim for payment to the\nUnited States in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the claims\n12\n\nand statements made to obtain payment from üV United States and constitutes a violation of\nthe False Claims Act. The government's investigation is ongoing.\nCOUNT I\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n29.

      "text": "U.S. v. Greenbelt Nursing\nNH-MD-001-003\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n(SOUTHERN DIVISION)\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  :\nPlaintiff,  :\nv.  :  Civil Action No.\nGREENBELT NURSING &  :\nREHABILITATION\nCENTER\nand\nNORTHERN HEALTH  :\nFACILITIES, INC.\nand\nEXTENDICARE  HEALTH\nSERVICES,  INC.  :\nand  :\nEXTENDICARE HOLDINGS, INC.  :\nand  :\nEXTENDICARE HEALTH FACILITIES,  :\nINC.\nand\nEXTENDICARE HEALTH FACILITIES\nHOLDING, INC.  :\nDefendants.  :\n___C—\n\nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nPlaintiff. United States of America, by its undersigned counsel, hereby moves\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 for preliminary and permanent  :njunctive\nrelief and for cause alleges:\nI.  The United States has filed a Complaint under the\nFalse Claims Act, 3 1  U.S.C. 3729. seeking injunctive relief and damages in connection\nwith an investigation of alleged federal law violations by the above-named Defendants.\nGreenbelt Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, et al., (\"Greenbelf `) in rendering standard\nnursing home care.  The United States alleges that Greenbelt has engaged in systemic\ndenial of care, including but not limited to: adequate medical care, use of psychotrophic\nand anti-depressant medications, failure to provide minimum standards of care guaranteed\nby law, and the submission of claims for payment by the United States, which falsely\nrepresent that the services are rendered in compliance with the law.\n2.  Since January 1998. the Maryland Licensing and Certification\nAdministration (^`MDLC``) and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). the\nState and federal regulatory agencies responsible for providing oversight of long term\ncare facilities such as Greenbelt, have invoked successive administrative remedies in\nresponse to findings of substandard care at Greenbelt.  Both MDLC and HCFA advised\nGreenbelt that failure to come into compliance with program participation requirements\nwould result in termination of funding from the Medicare aad Medicaid programs.  On\nJuly 24, 1998, Greenbelt certified compliance with program requirements and represented\n\nthat it had corrected deficiencies involving substandard care.  Based upon Greenbelt¯s\ncertification of compliance and representations. MDLC and HCFA accepted the\ncertification of compliance and Greenbelt was not terminated from federal or State\nprogram  funding.\n3.  After the July 1998 certification of compliance, the U.S. Attorney's\nOffice and the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health & Human\nServices continued an investigation of federal law violations.  On August 17. 1998. the\nOffice of Inspector General served a subpoena on Greenbelt and invoked its inspection\nauthority.  At the request of the U.S. Attorney's Office, and consistent with statutory\nauthority under federal and State law, state surveyors with the MDLC conducted an\ninterim site visit and a HCFA surveyor participated in a monitoring capacity.  The August\n17, 1998 site visit at Greenbelt revealed evidence that Greenbelt was not in compliance\nwith program requirements as represented in July 1998 and there continue to exist serious\ncare deficiencies most particularly involving failure to render or ensure adequate medical\ncare.  The government believes that injunctive relief is urgently required to ensure that the\nresidents are receiving basic care guaranteed by law.\n4.  On or about September 8, 1998. representatives from the U.S.\nAttorney's Office, Office of Inspector Genera! and the MDLC met with Greenbelt\ncorporate representatives and counsel.  The government explained the status of its\ninvestigation and its intent to seek injunctive relief by the filing of an action in U.S.\nDistrict Court.  As a result of extensive and cooperative discussions between the parties.\n\nGreenoelt and the government have reached mutual agreement on the terms ot`\npreliminary' injunctive relief, without admission or waiver of any rights that may be\nasserted in this proceeding and without the necessity of a contested injunction hearing.\nThe proposed preliminary injunction is ihereb* submitted herein for the C ourt¯s\nconsideration and approval.  The injunctive terms provide for significant protection of\nGreenbelt residents well beyond minimum legal requirements, including the appointment\nof a temporary manager of the facility, the appointment of an independent monitor and\nthe hiring of a certified nurse practitioner.  If appropriate, the parties respectfully request\nthe opportunity to meet with the Court to discuss the preliminary injunction and the status\nof this action.  The United States requests permission to withhold issuance of summons in\nthis action at this time.\nWHEREFORE, the United States of America pray that this Honorable Court:\nA.  Grant its Motion for Preliminary Injanctive Relief;\nB.  Enter the proposed Preliminary Injunctive Order submitted for approval by the\nParties;\nC.  Award such other and further relief as the nature of its cause may require.\n\nResnectfutly submitted.\nLynne A.
