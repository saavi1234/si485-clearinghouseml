GMS Management was a for-profit corporation and Tucker House II was a non-profit corporation.  Tucker House II hired GMS to provide care to residents of Tucker House Nursing Home, a long-term care facility certified to participate in Medicare and Medical Assistance Programs.  </p><p>The complaint alleged that the defendants schemed to collect payment from the federal government for care that was not rendered to elderly residents.  Individual residents were not provided with proper medical care or nutrition.  The United States claimed that the defendants violated the False Claims Act and were unjustly enriched through payments already received from the federal government.</p><p>The parties entered into a consent decree on March 6, 1996.  Tucker House II agreed to pay $25,000 to the United States as a payment for violating the False Claims Act, to provide proper medical care and nutrition to residents, to train its staff, and to allow an independent monitor into the facility.  It also agreed to comply with the Medicare and Medical Assistance Program Requirements and the Nursing Home Reform Act.  </p><p>The district court (Judge Jan E. Dubois) closed the case on March 6, 1996 and the PACER docket provides no further information about this case. </p><p> </p><p></p>",

(hereinafter \"the Act\") which took effect on\nOctober 1, 1990.  A nursing facility is defined in the Act as \"an\ninstitution...which—\n(1) is primarily engaged in providing to residents—\n(A)  skilled nursing care and related services for\nresidents who require medical or nursing\ncare,\n\n(B)  rehabilitation services for the\nrehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick\npersons, or\n(C)  on a regular basis, health-related care and\nservices to individuals who because of their\nmental or physical condition require care and\nservices  (above the level of room and board)\nwhich can be made available to them only\nthrough institutional facilities, and is not\nprimarily for the care and treatment of\nmental diseases;\n42 U.S.C.A.

Specifically, in terms of the quality of life for\nresidents of nursing facilities, the Act states that: \"A nursing\nfacility must care for its residents in such a manner and in such\nan environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the\nquality of life of each resident.\" 42 U.S.C.A. S l396r(b)(l)(A).\nAdditionally, the Act mandates that a nursing facility\n\"provide services and activities to attain or maintain the\nhighest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being\nof each resident in accordance with a written plan of care which-\n(A)  describes the medical, nursing, and psychosocial\nneeds of the resident and how such needs will be\nmet;...\"\n42 U.S.C.A.

These requirements are\nset forth at 42 CFR § 483.1 e£ sea, and \"serve as the basis for\nsurvey activities for the purpose of determining whether a\nfacility meets the requirements for participation  in Medicare and\nMedicaid.1* 42 CFR S 483.1.\nFederal regulations, when addressing quality of care\nconcerns, mandate that **[e]ach resident must receive and the\nfacility must provide the necessary care and services to attain\nor maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and\npsychosocial well-being, in accordance with the comprehensive\nassessment and plan of care.\"  42 CFR S 483.25.  The regulations\nspecifically address the area of nutrition:\n(i) Nutrition.  Based on a resident's  comprehensive\nassessment, the facility must ensure that a resident—\n(1) Maintains acceptable parameters of nutritional\nstatus, such as body weight and protein levels, unless the\nresident's clinical condition demonstrates that this is not\npossible; and\n(2) Receives a therapeutic diet when there is a\nnutritional problem.  42 CFR S 483.25(i).\n\nAdditionally, the Federal regulations specifically address those\nindividuals who are tube-fed:\n(g) Naso-gastric tubes.  Based on the comprehensive\nassessment of a resident, the facility must ensure that—\n(1)  A resident who has been able to eat enough\nalone or with assistance is not fed by naso-gastric tube\nunless the resident's clinical condition demonstrates that\nuse of a naso-gastric tube was unavoidable; and\n(2)  A resident who is fed by a naso-gastric or\ngastrostomy tube receives the appropriate treatment and\nservices to prevent aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea,\nvomiting, dehydration, metabolic abnormalities, and nasal-\npharyngeal ulcers and to restore, if possible, normal eating\nskills.  42 CFR S 483.25(g).\nTucker House Nursing Home is a licensed long-term care\n(nursing) facility under federal and state law and is certified\nto participate in the Medicare and Medical Assistance Programs.\nThe Medicare Program is a health insurance program for\nindividuals 65 years and older, certain disabled individuals\nunder ag· 65 and people of any ag· who have permanent kidney\nfailure.  Th· Medicare statute is codified at 42 U.S.C.A. S 1395\n(Title XVIII of the Social Security Act).\nThe Medical Assistance Program is a joint federal-state\nprogram funded under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.  The\nDepartment of Public Welfare administers the Medical Assistance\n\nProgram in Pennsylvania.  As a prerequisite to enrollment as a\nprovider in. the Medical Assistance Program, Tucker House entered\ninto a provider agreement and agreed to the following provisions:\n1.  That the submission by, or on behalf of, the\nFacility of any claim, either by hard copy or electronic\nmeans, shall be certification that the services or items\nfrom which payment is claimed actually were provided to the\nperson identified as a medical assistance resident by the\nperson or entity identified as the Facility on the dates\nindicated.\n*******\n5.

The Secretary [Department\nof Health and Human Services] shall be responsible for\n\ncertifying.../ the compliance of State nursing facilities with\nthe requirements of such subsections.  42 U.S.C.A.\nS l396r(g)¯(D (A).\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Health is responsible for\nperforming the survey function of long-term care facilities in\nPennsylvania.  By state regulation, facilities are required to\nmeet the daily nutritional needs of patients.  28 Pa. Code\nS 211.6(a).  Additionally, if consultant dietary services are\nused, the consultant's visits must be at appropriate times and of\nsufficient duration and frequency to provide continuing liaison\nwith medical and nursing staff and provide advice to the\nadministrator and participate in the development and revision of\ndietary policies and procedures.  28 Pa. Code § 2ll.6(m).\nLong-term care facilities are also required to provide\nnursing services that meet the needs of residents.  28 Pa. Code\nS 211.12(a).  It is incumbent upon the director of nursing\nservices to assure that \"preventive measures, treatments,\nmedications, diet and other health services prescribed are\nproperly carried out...\" 28 Pa. Code S 2ll.l2(e)(9).\nMoreover, a nursing facility is required to retain a medical\ndirector who is responsible for the \"coordination of the medical\ncare in th· facility to ensure the adequacy and appropriateness\nof the m·dical services provided to patients.\"  28 Pa. Code\nS 211.2(k).\nFinally, a nursing home administrator is charged with the\ngeneral administration of the facility whether or not his or her\n\nfunctions are shared with one or more other individuals.  63 P.s.\nS 1102(2)^... According to regulations promulgated by the Nursing\nHome Administrators Board, a nursing home administrator is\nresponsible for: (a) evaluating the quality of resident care and\nefficiency of services, (b) maintaining compliance with\ngovernmental regulations, and (c) developing policies which\ngovern the continuing care and related medical and other services\nprovided by the facility which reflect the facility's philosophy\nto provide a high level of resident care in a healthy, safe and\ncomfortable environment.  49 Pa. Code §§ 39.91(1)(i),(ii),(vi).\nIn March 1994, Tucker House was surveyed by Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Health surveyors. The surveyors ordered Tucker\nHouse personnel to immediately arrange for the transfer of\nseveral residents from Tucker House to local hospitals for\ntreatment.  Ultimately, new management was installed at Tucker\nHouse Nursing Home.\nThe Government's complaint charges that the defendants\ncaused the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the United\nStates for payment for care that was not adequately rendered to\nsome of the most vulnerable members of our society; the frail,\nimmobil· elderly residing at Tucker House Nursing Home.\n\nFACTUAL BASIS FOR COMPLAINT\nRESIDENT 1-\nResident 1 entered Tucker House Nursing Home in 1989.  He\nweighed 125 pounds and had a serum albumin of 3.1 at the time of\nadmission. The normal range for serum albumin is between 3.5 and\n4.5. Resident l·s height was between 5· 9·· and 5· 11\" and his\nideal body weight was between 148 and 158 pounds. From November\n1991 through August 1993, his weight decreased. In August 1993,\nResident 1 weighed 105 pounds and in October 1993, he weighed 104\npounds.  By January 1994, Resident l's serum albumin was 1.8,\nwhich indicates profound protein malnourishment.  While at Tucker\nHouse Nursing Home, Resident 1 was not provided with adequate\nnutrition and was so malnourished by October 1993, there was no\nway that his body could heal itself or respond to injury in a\nsuccessful manner. Resident l was hospitalized in March of 1994\nand was suffering from multiple Stage IV decubitus ulcers.\nRESIDENT 2\nResident 2 entered Tucker House Nursing Home in 1987\nweighing 168 pounds which was 20% over his ideal body weight.  As\nof February 1990, he weighed 14l pounds which was approximately\nhis ideal body weight.  By August 1992, Resident 2 weighed 116\npounds which was approximately 83% of his id·al body weight.  In\nFebruary 1993, Resident 2 began to develop decubitus ulcers that\ndid not heal.  By October 1993, he weighed 98 pounds and his\nserum albumin level was 2.6 indicating severe protein\nmalnourishment.  In October 1993, Resident 2 was found to be\n8\n\nmalnourished by physician consultants at Tucker House Nursing\nHome which_·led to him being hospitalized, yet the proper amount\nof nutritional alimentation was not provided until March 1994.\nRESIDENT 3\nResident 3 was admitted to Tucker House Nursing Home in\nNovember 1989.  In 1993, she began to lose weight and her skin\nbegan to break down.  A weight loss of 19.2 pounds was noted in\nDecember 1993 and Resident 3, at that point in time, weighed 98.2\npounds.  Her ideal body weight was 110 pounds.  Three days later\nshe was weighed at 92.7 pounds with a notation in the nursing\nhome's records that her appetite was good. By February 1994,\nResident 3's albumin was 2.2 which evidenced the fact that she\nwas profoundly malnourished.  As of March 15, 1994, Resident 3\nweighed 85 pounds.\nAdditionally, Resident 3 was ambulatory upon admission and\nher medical records do not evidence an unavoidable decline in\nambulation.  As evidenced in her nursing home records, she was\nfrequently in a wheelchair, often in restraints. This positioning\ndoes not allow for adequate pressure relief for the sacral and\ngluteal areas.  The decubitus ulcers that were noted that\noccurred prior to January 1994 were related to inadequate\npressure relief.\n\nTn i eviction and\nr\n.1.
