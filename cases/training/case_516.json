GMS Management was a for-profit corporation and Tucker House II was a non-profit corporation.  Tucker House II hired GMS to provide care to residents of Tucker House Nursing Home, a long-term care facility certified to participate in Medicare and Medical Assistance Programs.  </p><p>The complaint alleged that the defendants schemed to collect payment from the federal government for care that was not rendered to elderly residents.  Individual residents were not provided with proper medical care or nutrition.  The United States claimed that the defendants violated the False Claims Act and were unjustly enriched through payments already received from the federal government.</p><p>The parties entered into a consent decree on March 6, 1996.  Tucker House II agreed to pay $25,000 to the United States as a payment for violating the False Claims Act, to provide proper medical care and nutrition to residents, to train its staff, and to allow an independent monitor into the facility.  It also agreed to comply with the Medicare and Medical Assistance Program Requirements and the Nursing Home Reform Act.  </p><p>The district court (Judge Jan E. Dubois) closed the case on March 6, 1996 and the PACER docket provides no further information about this case. </p><p> </p><p></p>",

S 1395\n(Title XVIII of the Social Security Act).\nThe Medical Assistance Program is a joint federal-state\nprogram funded under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.  The\nDepartment of Public Welfare administers the Medical Assistance\n\nProgram in Pennsylvania.  As a prerequisite to enrollment as a\nprovider in. the Medical Assistance Program, Tucker House entered\ninto a provider agreement and agreed to the following provisions:\n1.  That the submission by, or on behalf of, the\nFacility of any claim, either by hard copy or electronic\nmeans, shall be certification that the services or items\nfrom which payment is claimed actually were provided to the\nperson identified as a medical assistance resident by the\nperson or entity identified as the Facility on the dates\nindicated.\n*******\n5.

By state regulation, facilities are required to\nmeet the daily nutritional needs of patients.  28 Pa. Code\nS 211.6(a).  Additionally, if consultant dietary services are\nused, the consultant's visits must be at appropriate times and of\nsufficient duration and frequency to provide continuing liaison\nwith medical and nursing staff and provide advice to the\nadministrator and participate in the development and revision of\ndietary policies and procedures.  28 Pa.

Code ยงยง 39.91(1)(i),(ii),(vi).\nIn March 1994, Tucker House was surveyed by Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Health surveyors. The surveyors ordered Tucker\nHouse personnel to immediately arrange for the transfer of\nseveral residents from Tucker House to local hospitals for\ntreatment.  Ultimately, new management was installed at Tucker\nHouse Nursing Home.\nThe Government's complaint charges that the defendants\ncaused the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the United\nStates for payment for care that was not adequately rendered to\nsome of the most vulnerable members of our society; the frail,\nimmobilยท elderly residing at Tucker House Nursing Home.\n\nFACTUAL BASIS FOR COMPLAINT\nRESIDENT 1-\nResident 1 entered Tucker House Nursing Home in 1989.  He\nweighed 125 pounds and had a serum albumin of 3.1 at the time of\nadmission. The normal range for serum albumin is between 3.5 and\n4.5. Resident lยทs height was between 5ยท 9ยทยท and 5ยท 11\" and his\nideal body weight was between 148 and 158 pounds. From November\n1991 through August 1993, his weight decreased. In August 1993,\nResident 1 weighed 105 pounds and in October 1993, he weighed 104\npounds.  By January 1994, Resident l's serum albumin was 1.8,\nwhich indicates profound protein malnourishment.  While at Tucker\nHouse Nursing Home, Resident 1 was not provided with adequate\nnutrition and was so malnourished by October 1993, there was no\nway that his body could heal itself or respond to injury in a\nsuccessful manner. Resident l was hospitalized in March of 1994\nand was suffering from multiple Stage IV decubitus ulcers.\nRESIDENT 2\nResident 2 entered Tucker House Nursing Home in 1987\nweighing 168 pounds which was 20% over his ideal body weight.  As\nof February 1990, he weighed 14l pounds which was approximately\nhis ideal body weight.  By August 1992, Resident 2 weighed 116\npounds which was approximately 83% of his idยทal body weight.  In\nFebruary 1993, Resident 2 began to develop decubitus ulcers that\ndid not heal.  By October 1993, he weighed 98 pounds and his\nserum albumin level was 2.6 indicating severe protein\nmalnourishment.  In October 1993, Resident 2 was found to be\n8\n\nmalnourished by physician consultants at Tucker House Nursing\nHome which_ยทled to him being hospitalized, yet the proper amount\nof nutritional alimentation was not provided until March 1994.\nRESIDENT 3\nResident 3 was admitted to Tucker House Nursing Home in\nNovember 1989.  In 1993, she began to lose weight and her skin\nbegan to break down.  A weight loss of 19.2 pounds was noted in\nDecember 1993 and Resident 3, at that point in time, weighed 98.2\npounds.  Her ideal body weight was 110 pounds.  Three days later\nshe was weighed at 92.7 pounds with a notation in the nursing\nhome's records that her appetite was good. By February 1994,\nResident 3's albumin was 2.2 which evidenced the fact that she\nwas profoundly malnourished.  As of March 15, 1994, Resident 3\nweighed 85 pounds.\nAdditionally, Resident 3 was ambulatory upon admission and\nher medical records do not evidence an unavoidable decline in\nambulation.  As evidenced in her nursing home records, she was\nfrequently in a wheelchair, often in restraints. This positioning\ndoes not allow for adequate pressure relief for the sacral and\ngluteal areas.  The decubitus ulcers that were noted that\noccurred prior to January 1994 were related to inadequate\npressure relief.\n\nTn i eviction and\nr\n.1.
