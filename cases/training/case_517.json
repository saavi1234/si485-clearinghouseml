In a December 19, 1996 letter to the mayor of Philadelphia, the Department of Justice described the unconstitutional conditions in the facility.  The facility failed to ensure the safety of or provide the most basic care to its residents.  Staff neglected residents and allowed them to reside in unsanitary conditions.  In 1994, the city had privatized the facility, turning its management over to Episcopal Long Term Care, and a previous investigation by the Pennsylvania Department of Health found chaotic conditions in the facility.  </p><p>The Department of Justice filed a complaint on August 13, 1998 against the City of Philadelphia and Episcopal Long Term Care in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The complaint sought to enjoin the defendant from violating the constitutional rights of PNH residents.  It alleged that the defendants had also violated the Nursing Home Reform Act, CRIPA, and the False Claims Act, and were unjustly enriched by funds received from the federal government.  </p><p>The parties reached a settlement agreement, which was filed contemporaneously with the complaint.  The City of Philadelphia and Episcopal Long Term Care agreed to do the following:</p><p>•\tensure that residents were free from mistreatment and neglect;</p><p>•\tprovide adequate psychiatric, medical, and nursing care;</p><p>•\tlimit the use of restraints;</p><p>•\tallow a federal monitor to implement the agreement;</p><p>•\tpay $50,000 for violating the False Claims Act; and, </p><p>•\tcreate a $15,000 fund to improve the lives of residents. </p><p>On August 14, 1998, the district court (Judge Stewart Dalzell) approved the settlement agreement and closed the case.  </p><p></p>",

This case was instituted by the United States pursuant to\nthe Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\") ,\n42 U.S.C. § 1997, and pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.\n§ 3729 e_£ SfijJ.\nB. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1345 and 31 U.S.C. § 3729.\nC. Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\n\nD. 42 U.S.C. § 1997a and 31 U.S.C. §§ 3730 and 3732 give the\nUnited States standing to file a complaint under CRIPA and the\nFalse Claims Act.\nE. The Defendants are the City of Philadelphia, Edward G.\nRendell, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia  (\"the City\") , Estelle\nB. Richman, Commissioner, Health Department  (collectively \"City\nDefendants\") ; and Episcopal Long Term Care (\"ELTC\") . All\nindividual City Defendants are named in their official\ncapacities.  ELTC is named in its capacity as operator of the\nPhiladelphia Nursing Home (\"PNH\") under contract with the City.\nF. The Defendants have authority and responsibility for the\noperation of PNH which, at the time of the filing of this\nSettlement Agreement, is a certified \"Provider\" under Title XVIII\n(Medicare) and Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act.\nThe individual Defendants are officers of the Executive Branch of\nthe City of Philadelphia.  ELTC provides essential health care\nand related services to residents at PNH pursuant to a contract\nwith the City of Philadelphia.\n1. ELTC is responsible for corrective action under this\nSettlement Agreement only for conditions and practices that\nhave occurred and are occurring while it is the PNH\ncontractor.\n- 2 -\n\n2. Nothing herein is intended to waive or release any claims\nor rights as against Service Master Diversified Health\nServices, Inc. and/or Service Master Diversified Health\nServices L.P., which previously operated PNH under a\nsubcontract with ELTC.\n3. In the event that ELTC is no longer the PNH contractor\nand the City should hire another contractor to operate PNH,\nany future successor shall similarly be bound by the\nprovisions of this Settlement Agreement and the\nresponsibilities under this Settlement Agreement will be\ntransferred to such successor.\nG. On August 17, 1995, the Attorney General of the United\nStates, by and through the Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nRights Division, notified the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia,\nthe City Solicitor of the City of Philadelphia, the Commissioner\nof the City of Philadelphia Health Department, and Mary K.\n(\"Molly\") Hess, the individual appointed by ELTC to serve as the\nExecutive Director of PNH pursuant to contractual arrangements\nbetween the City and ELTC, of her intention to investigate\nallegations of unconstitutional and unlawful conditions at PNH\npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act,\n42 U.S.C. § 1997.\n- 3 -\n\nH. In November 1995, the Civil Rights Division, in\ncooperation with the United States Attorney's Office for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania, commenced an investigation into\nthe care being provided to residents of PNH.  Thereafter, on\nDecember 19, 1996, the Attorney General of the United States, by\nand through the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights\nDivision, informed the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, the\nActing City Solicitor of the City of Philadelphia, the\nCommissioner of the City of Philadelphia Health Department, and\nMolly Hess, the Executive Director of PNH, that the Attorney\nGeneral concluded that she had reasonable cause to believe that\npersons residing in PNH (\"residents\") were being subjected to\nconditions that deprived them of their federal statutory rights\nand of their rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the\nConstitution of the United States.\nI. The parties agree that the care, treatment, and\nconditions of residency of PNH residents implicate rights that\nare secured and protected by the Constitution of the United\nStates and implicate their rights under Titles XVIII and XIX of\nthe Social Security Act (Medicare/Medicaid) and the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act.  The parties entering into this Settlement\nAgreement, for the purpose of avoiding protracted and adversarial\n- 4 -\n\nlitigation, agree to the provisions set forth herein.\nJ. In entering into this Settlement Agreement, neither City\nDefendants nor ELTC admit to any violation of law or admit any\nfact, and this Settlement Agreement may not be used as evidence\nof liability against the parties to this Settlement Agreement in\nany other civil proceeding.  Nothing herein is intended to waive\nany rights or claims with respect to third parties who are not\nparties to this Settlement Agreement.\nK. The parties agree that the provisions of this Settlement\nAgreement are a lawful, fair and appropriate resolution of this\ncase.\nL. This Settlement Agreement, voluntarily entered into,\nshall be entered by the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania and shall be enforceable as an\norder of the Court solely to the extent set forth herein.\nM. This Settlement Agreement is legally binding and\njudicially enforceable by the parties and it shall be applicable\nto and binding upon all of the parties, their officers, agents,\nemployees, assigns, and successors.\nNow, therefore, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n- 5 -\n\nII.  COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW AND ATTACHED PROTOCOLS\nA. In the operation and management of PNH and in providing\nservices to PNH residents, the Defendants shall comply fully with\nthe particular provisions of the Nursing Home Reform Act as\nembodied in Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1395 e_£ ££o^_, and Title XIX of the Social Security Act,\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 e_L seq.  and the regulations and guidelines\nf \npromulgated pursuant to these statutes.  S_e_e. attached Exhibit 1,\n42 C.F.R. § 483, Subparts B, C, D, and E, § 483.1 through\n§ 483.206.  The parties agree that the language in 42 C.F.R.\n§ 483.1 through § 483.206, as well as the attached long term care\nguidelines, are incorporated by reference into this Settlement\nAgreement and that the provisions of this Settlement Agreement\nare to be construed consistent therewith.  Defendants shall also\ncomply fully with the particular provisions of the PNH protocols\nattached to this Settlement Agreement and incorporated by\nreference herein.  Defendants agree that their obligation to\ncomply fully with the language of the attached protocols does not\nlimit their obligation to comply fully with federal law or with\nthe provisions of this Settlement Agreement.\nB. Defendants1  submission of plans of correction and/or\ncertification by the Health Care Financing Administration  (HCFA)\n- 6 -\n\ndoes not in and of itself constitute compliance with this\nSettlement Agreement.  The conclusion of the Monitor  (as defined\nin § XVII of this Agreement) that Defendants are out of\ncompliance with the Settlement Agreement does not in and of\nitself constitute noncompliance with the Settlement Agreement.\nC. Defendants shall comply fully with the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 e_L seq. , and Section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the\nregulations promulgated pursuant to these statutes.\nD. Since the events in 1995 that led to the initiation of\nthis matter, ELTC has developed and implemented a number of\npolicies, procedures, protocols and action plans  (collectively or\nindividually hereinafter referred to as \"protocols\") which\npertain to the subject matter in this Settlement Agreement,\ncopies of which have been provided to the United States.  Many of\nthese documents have been attached as Exhibits to this Settlement\nAgreement and incorporated hereunder.\n1. If the Defendants seek to modify a PNH protocol which has\nbeen attached to and incorporated into this Settlement\nAgreement, the Defendants shall first submit any proposed\nmodification to the United States and the Monitor for\nreview.\n- 7 -\n\n2. The United States or the Monitor may provide the\nDefendants with comments or recommendations regarding the\nproposed protocol modification within 3 0 days of receipt of\nthe proposed modification.\n3. If the United States or the Monitor does not submit any\ncomments or recommendations, the Defendants shall submit the\nmodification to the Court and the protocol modification\nshall become final upon submission to the Court with\nappropriate notice of filing to the Court, all parties and\nthe Monitor.\n4. In the event that the United States or the Monitor\nsubmits any comments or recommendations, the Defendants\nshall consider the comments and recommendations.  If the\nDefendants decline to adopt the recommendations or comments\nof the United States or the Monitor, they shall so notify\nthe United States and the Monitor, and the parties and the\nMonitor shall confer within 30 days.\n5. If the parties reach agreement to modify a protocol, the\nparties shall submit the modification to the Court and the\nprotocol modification shall become final upon submission to\nthe Court with appropriate notice of filing to the Court,\nall parties and the Monitor.  If the parties do not reach\n- 8 -\n\nagreement, Defendants may seek modification of the protocol\nwith the Court by motion and the United States may present\nits objections.\n6.

Rendell  II III I  IIII I I II II ||  II |||||| II\n215 City Hall  NH PA-004-006 \"\"••\" \"\"\" '\"\nPhiladelphia, PA  19107\nRe:  Investigation of the Philadelphia Nursing Home\nDear Mayor Rendell:\nOn July 28, 1995, we notified you, pursuant to the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized  Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997, of our intent to investigate conditions at the\nPhiladelphia Nursing Home  (\"PNH\") in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.\nWe conducted our investigation by reviewing facility records,\nincluding residents' medical charts and other documents  relating\nto the care and treatment of PNH residents,  interviewing\nadministrators, staff, and residents, and conducting  on-site\ntours of the facility with three expert consultants:  Blaine S.\nGreenwald, M.D., a geriatric psychiatrist, Ronald D. Adelman,\nM.D., a geriatric physician, and Geraldine Mendelson, R.N.,\nM.Ed., M.A., C.N.A.A.,  a geriatric nurse.  Following these tours,\nwe obtained and analyzed survey reports from  independent\nconsultants retained by the City to evaluate conditions at PNH.\nConsistent with CRIPA's statutory requirements, we are now\nwriting to inform you of our findings.\nBased on our comprehensive  investigative review, we have\nconcluded that there are numerous conditions and practices at PNH\nthat violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of\nPNH residents.  This conclusion should come as little  surprise\ngiven that throughout our visit, a number of PNH  administrators\nand professional and direct care staff readily admitted that many\nservice areas were insufficient and needed remedial attention.\nOur independent conclusions and findings were also supported by\nthe conclusions and findings contained in the City's own\ndocuments summarizing  its many internally generated  on-site\nreviews of the facility.  We have set forth below the  facts\nsupporting our findings of unlawful and  unconstitutional\nconditions at PNH.\nBefore addressing the substantive violations, we would  like\nto express our appreciation to the PNH administrators and staff\nand the City of Philadelphia representatives who extended  their\n\n- 2 -\ncooperation and courtesy while we visited the facility.  We would\nespecially like to recognize Mollie Hess, Executive Director of\nPNH, and Jim Casey of PNH for their professionalism, hard work\nand diligent efforts in supplying us with the information we\nneeded to conduct a thorough and accurate investigation of PNH.\nIndeed, both repeatedly stressed their sincere desire to improve\nconditions and practices at the facility.  We hope to be able to\ncontinue to work with the City and PNH officials in such an\natmosphere of cooperation and good faith.\nI.  PNH IS FAILING TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ITS RESIDENTS AND TO\nPROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THEIR BASIC CARE NEEDS\nIndividuals residing in a state or municipally operated\ninstitution have a fundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process\nright to basic care and reasonably safe conditions.\nYounabera v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  Federal statutes\ngoverning the operation of nursing homes create similar rights.\nSee. e.g.. Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs\n(Medicaid), 42 U.S.C. § 1396r, Health Insurance for Aged and\nDisabled  (Medicare), 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3, and their implementing\nregulations, 42 C.F.R. § 483, Subpart B.  PNH fails to provide\nadequately for the most basic care needs of many of its residents\nand fails to ensure resident safety, thereby violating the legal\nrights of its residents.\nA.  PNH Fails To Ensure Resident Safety\nPNH violates residents' rights by failing to provide a safe\nenvironment.  Protection from harm is a fundamental\nconstitutional right and a basic requirement of facilities, such\nas PNH, receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds.  Younqberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982); 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.13, 483.15\n(residents have the right to be free from verbal, sexual,\nphysical, and mental abuse, and corporal punishment; the facility\nmust also provide a \"safe\" environment).\nThe facility's incident reports and special abuse\ninvestigations reveal a high level of injuries and dangerous\nsituations that place residents at risk of harm.  Many of these\nincidents are preventable and reflect systemic deficiencies at\nPNH including lack of adequate staffing, failure to supervise\nresidents, and inadequate assessment and treatment of mental\nillness, cognitive impairments, and behavior problems.  A number\nof the incidents result from aggressive PNH residents attacking\nother residents.  For example, in the space of a few weeks during\nthe summer months just prior to our tour, the following incidents\noccurred at PNH:  J.S \"assaulted\" J.C. by punching her in her\nleft eye; a day earlier, J.S. punched her in the right jaw; F.F.\npunched W.W. in the head and chest and hit D.D. giving her a\nbruised eye; T.W.  \"attacked\" J.F. with a glass vase, striking him\non the head causing an occipital laceration; B.W. and P.S. were\n\n- 3 -\nhitting each other on the arms and shoulders; N.S. entered B.M.'s\nroom and punched her in the face; C.Q. punched E.M. in the chest;\nJ.R. hit A.S. three times in the head causing a lump on A.S.'s\nhead; J.R. threw a cup of coffee and his walker at E.A.; and V.M.\nhit N.S. in the chest.  During the same few weeks, a PNH aide\nallegedly \"started slapping Mr. E.  [a resident] in the face.\"\nOther injuries and harmful situations have resulted from\nunsupervised residents who elope or abuse alcohol while in the\nfacility.  These are merely representative examples of other\nsimilar preventable incidents that are routinely occurring\nthroughout the facility that demonstrate a systemic failure to\nprotect residents from harm.\nB.  PNH Often Fails To Provide Basic Care To Residents\nPNH also often fails to meet the most basic care needs of\nits residents.  While we found a relatively clean facility at the\ntime of our tour, we also uncovered a number of disturbing\nexamples where residents' basic care needs were not met.  For\nexample, we discovered foul odors on residents and in resident\nrooms, and unkempt and dirty residents wearing unsanitary clothes\nthat were malodorous and covered with food or fluid.  Upon\nsmelling a \"severe urine odor\" coming from one resident's room,\nour nurse consultant discovered a resident in a bed that was\nsoaking wet in which he had apparently been left for some time.\nDr. Greenwald reports that the \"stench was hardly bearable\" in\nanother resident's room.  Dr. Greenwald concludes that these\n\"neglectful situations could be interpreted as a kind of passive\nabuse ... [which] trespassed beyond the typical range of hygienic\nconditions that one encounters in nursing homes.\"  During our\ntour, several PNH care aides freely admitted dismay about the\nlack of staff concern and attention paid to the residents' basic\ncare needs.\nThe City has documented similar problems in its on-site\nreviews of conditions at PNH.  For instance, City surveyors in\nMarch 1995 found \"a lack of overall cleanliness  [at PNH].  Odors\nwere prevalent throughout the building, residents' rooms were\n•unkempt, wheelchairs and geri chairs were dirty and in ill\nrepair.\"  Perhaps most troubling was the City surveyors'\nconclusion that PNH failed to remedy these basic care problems\neven after having been alerted to them on prior occasions.\nA number of different PNH residents spoke to us freely and\nat length about the many substandard conditions and practices at\nPNH.  The independent observations and conclusions of the\nresidents reinforced one another as our tour progressed.  Some\nresidents complained that units are short-staffed, especially on\nthe weekends and evenings, and that staff members generally do\nnot assist the residents.  Virtually all residents we spoke to\ncomplained that PNH nurses failed to respond in a timely fashion\nto their calls for assistance.  One resident felt that conditions\n\n- 4 -\nhad improved somewhat since the recent arrival of the newer\nhealth care staff, but he felt that the newer staff members were\ninexperienced and not properly trained to care for the population\nat PNH.  Most troubling, this resident expressed concern about\nthe staff's slow response to his emergency needs.  He related\nthat when he has experienced shortness of breath, experienced a\nrapid heartbeat, or has run out of his supply of oxygen, it has\ntaken PNH staff twenty minutes to come to help him.  This\nconclusion is consistent with the City's independent on-site\nreview findings in October 1995 that a number of PNH staff do not\ntend to the residents' needs while on duty, including residents\nwho have medical orders to receive one-to-one supervision.\nIn addition, more than one resident indicated that the PNH\nstaff members are generally insensitive towards the residents,\nthat the PNH aides talk to the residents with a disrespectful,\noften verbally abusive tone, and that their personal belongings\nare stolen.  The PNH administration, having taken the positive\nstep of regularly attending resident council meetings,\nacknowledged to us that many of the residents' concerns are\nlegitimate.\nII.  PNH FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ACTIVITIES TO RESIDENTS AND\nUSES UNREASONABLE RESTRAINTS\nPNH is failing to engage its residents in adequate,\nappropriate and meaningful activities in violation of their\nfederal statutory rights.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. § 483.15\n(\"facility must provide for an ongoing program of activities\ndesigned to meet  ... the interests and the physical, mental, and\npsychosocial well-being of each resident\").\nEven the City's on-site review has uncovered that often no\nactivities take place at PNH and that \"[t]here are not enough\nactivities scheduled for the diversity of this population.\"  The\nCity's November 1995 on-site review discovered PNH activities\nstaff reading the newspaper, listening to the radio or watching\ntelevision instead of engaging the residents in activities.  PNH\nresidents have expressed similar concerns.\nOne consequence of the lack of meaningful activity may be\nresident abuse of alcohol resulting from boredom and lack of\nstaff supervision and involvement with residents.  This problem\nappears to be widespread at PNH.  For example, the City's\nOctober 1995 on-site review reveals that one verbally abusive and\nphysically aggressive resident had a persistent problem with\n\"smelling of alcohol,\" and being found sleeping in the lounge\nwith bottles of alcohol present.  An August 11, 1995 PNH special\nabuse notification letter indicates that another resident left\nthe facility in his wheelchair via the front gate while he was\nintoxicated.  During our tour, one PNH mental health consultant\n\n- 5 -\nacknowledged that there is a great need for programming and\ntreatment for residents with alcoholism at PNH.\nIn addition, PNH frequently uses restraints as a substitute\nfor keeping the residents engaged.  This practice violates the\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of residents.\nYounabera v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982); 42 C.F.R. § 483.13\n(\"resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical\nrestraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience, and\nnot required to treat the resident's medical symptoms\").\nMoreover, PNH restraint practices do not comport with\naccepted professional standards.  During our tour, we discovered\nthat many residents were in restraints or in bed with the bed\nrails up, restricting their ability to leave the bed, without\nproper physicians' orders.  Indeed, PNH is failing to provide its\nresidents with adequate evaluations prior to the use of or\ninitiation of an order for restraints.  The City's own on-site\nreviews of PNH confirm our findings. 1/  We also found that some\nresidents were not released from their restraints every two hours\nas is generally accepted.  These inappropriate restraint\"\npractices violate PNH residents' rights.\nIII. PNH IS FAILING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE FOR ITS\nRESIDENTS\nIn addition to basic care and safety, all residents of state\nor municipally operated institutional facilities have a\nfundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to adequate\nhealth care.  Younabera v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  See also\n42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(A)\n(facility must provide for medical, nursing and related services\nto \"attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental,\nand psychosocial well-being of each resident,\" and provide\nadequate treatment and services required by mentally ill and\nmentally retarded residents), and their implementing regulations,\n42 C.F.R. § 483, Subpart B.  However, PNH fails to provide its\nresidents with medical, nursing and psychiatric care and services\nthat comport with generally accepted practices.\ni/  For example, the November 1995 on-site review indicates \"no\norders when restraint use indicated in record ... orders for side\nrails many times not seen ... no assessment of restraint use.\"\nSimilarly, the October on-site review reveals:  \"[s]ide rails up\non beds throughout facility, but no orders for them\"; \"[e]vening\nshift documents that side rails are up, but no physician's order\nis seen\"; \"[n]ursing documented at 10 p.m. that side rails were\nup, but no order was written for them.\"  The September on-site\nreview again reveals that PNH often places residents in\nrestraints without proper orders:  \"use of 'leg restraint' - no\norder seen for such\"; \"[r]esident needs order for side rails.\"\n\n- 6 -\nA.  Psychiatric Practices And Mental Health Services Are\nInadequate And Do Not Meet The Needs Of The Residents\nPNH is not providing its mentally ill residents with\nadequate psychiatric and mental health services in accordance\nwith generally accepted standards.  Psychiatric practices at PNH\nare typically characterized by superficial evaluations,\ninadequate follow-ups, a lack of non-drug treatment approaches, a\nlack of cogent treatment planning, a lack of multidisciplinary\ninput into psychiatric treatment decisionmaking, and a lack of\npsychiatric inservices.\nThe City, through its on-site review documents and the\nstatements of its employees, readily admits deficiencies in\nmental health services at PNH.  For example, the City's own\nNovember 1995 on-site review reveals \"zero percent\" compliance\nwith professional standards in its review of antipsychotic\ntherapy at PNH.  During our tour, both PNH's mental health\nconsultants and nurses freely admitted deficiencies in\npsychiatric care and mental health services at PNH.\n1.  Mental Health Assessments, Diagnoses And Treatments Are\nInappropriate\nPNH is generally failing to appropriately assess, diagnose\nand treat its residents who need mental health services.  For\nexample, although many residents have cognitive impairments and\ndementia, PNH does not perform proper cognitive examinations and\ndoes not develop adequate and appropriate dementia work-ups.\nThese failures can lead to needless resident deterioration and to\nthe development of irreversible conditions in residents that\nmight have been reversible.  In addition, PNH charts often lack\nconsistent or appropriate diagnoses.  An adequate diagnosis is\nessential to develop appropriate treatment.  As Dr. Greenwald\nnotes, an inadequate diagnosis \"can lead to improper treatment\nthat could harm the resident, either by subjecting him or her to\nneedless medication and its attendant side effects, and/or by\nfailing to treat the underlying mental illness, thereby exposing\nthe resident to negative target behaviors that are not properly\ncontrolled.\"\nAs a result of the flawed assessment process and inadequate\ndiagnostic formulation, treatments are often not appropriate.\nFor example, several PNH residents have been inappropriately\nplaced on multiple psychotropic drugs without clearly documented\nbenefit.  Such polypharmacy treatment places these residents at\nunnecessary risk of harm of medication side effects and\nimproperly medicates them without the benefit of productively\ntreating their mental illness.  In this regard,  Dr. Greenwald\nconcludes that PNH has engaged in \"cavalier\" polypharmacy\npractice which is \"dangerous,\" and \"likely-to-be harmful.\"\n\n- 7 -\nPNH also fails to provide its residents with adequate and\nnecessary non-drug mental health services.  Resident care plans\ngenerally fail to substantively address mental health treatment.\nA number of PNH residents who could benefit from psychosocial\ntreatment do not receive these services.  Because of this,\nDr. Greenwald concludes that the residents \"may remain mired in a\nstate of institutionalized dysfunctionality, when their potential\nto improve may be significant.\"\nMoreover, there is a marked discrepancy between published\nPNH policies and the reality of practice at PNH.  Contrary to\nwhat is written in the Administrative Policies and Procedures\nguidelines, care plans do not seriously \"build on resident's\nstrengths\" or \"have treatment objectives with measurable\noutcomes\" that are actually measured, and the facility does not\nensure that residents \"who use antipsychotic drugs receive\ngradual dose reductions, drug holidays or behavioral\nprogramming.\"\n2.  Psychiatric Drug Side Effects Monitoring Is Inadequate\nMedication side effects monitoring at PNH is inadequate and\nfails to meet generally accepted standards.  Residents are often\nneedlessly subjected to the risks of side effects of the treating\nmedication, thus further exacerbating their already fragile\ncondition.  Because of the increased sensitivity to medications\namong the elderly, it is important that PNH actively monitor side\neffects.  However, PNH does not provide adequate side effects\nmonitoring.  For example, PNH's abnormal involuntary movement\nmonitoring is inconsistent at best and typically inaccurate.\nThis failure is especially troubling given that some abnormal\ninvoluntary movement side effects associated with antipsychotics\nmay be irreversible for some of the residents.\nPNH chart notes rarely reflect that specific drug side\neffects are considered in the treatment equation.  The consult\npsychiatrist has largely abdicated side effect monitoring for\nantipsychotics to a form that nurses are supposed to fill out,\nbut rarely if ever do.  Several PNH nursing staff even admitted\nto us that they do not know what side effects to look for.  We\nfound that side effects data collection is inadequate in that the\nPNH forms are haphazardly filled out and, when they are filled\nout, are often inaccurate.  The City's on-site review findings\nconsistently confirm these deficiencies in side effects\nmonitoring.\nAs a result of these deficiencies, PNH often chronically\nadministers psychotropic medications that have not proven to be\neffective.  PNH therefore unnecessarily subjects its residents to\nmedication side effects.  Dr. Greenwald concludes that the\nconsequence of this practice is that \"potentially successful\npsychiatric treatment and rehabilitation is undermined, and in\n\n- 8 -\nselected residents, longer-than-necessary  institutionalization\nmaintained and potential re-entry to mainstream society derailed.\nAll of these deficiencies contribute to either harming the\nresidents or placing them at increased risk of harm.\"\n3.  Psychiatric Progress Notes, Forms And Documentation Are\nInadequate\nPsychiatric chart documentation at PNH is inadequate and\nconveys little meaningful information.  Our experts found that\nprogress notes, behavior/side effect monitoring forms, and\nproblem lists do not accurately summarize current clinical\ncircumstances.  The PNH notes are usually superficial, employ\ngeneralities, are not tied to residents' symptoms or diagnoses,\nand do not identify goals of treatment.  Moreover, even when\nclinical findings are documented, they often do not yield\nappropriate and needed treatments.\n4.  Mental Health Resources And Expertise Are Insufficient\nPNH does not provide a sufficient number of psychiatry\nconsult hours to meet the needs of the residents.  The current\nconsult psychiatrist admitted that he did not see every resident\nwith mental illness at PNH at least once a year as required by\nprofessional standards.  In fact, he admitted that he only sees\nresidents on a referral basis rather than proactively instituting\na case-identification protocol and appropriate follow-up system.\nAs a result, the psychiatrist admitted that some residents have\nnot been seen who should have been seen simply because no\nreferral had been made.  Indeed, Dr. Greenwald found residents\nwith mental illness who have exhibited violent or threatening\nbehaviors who have not had any psychiatric consultations.  Even\nthe new PNH mental health team acknowledged that more psychiatric\ntime was necessary at PNH given the large number of residents\nwith mental health concerns.\nWe uncovered several instances where a psychiatric consult\nwas ordered but the psychiatrist did not actually see the\nresident for weeks.  This practice is improper and compromises\nattentive resident care because the condition prompting the\npsychiatric consult may become dramatically exacerbated in the\nintervening weeks.  Dr. Greenwald found that it produces the\nlikelihood of \"untoward and potentially dangerous\" incidents that\ncould occur, placing the resident or others at risk of harm.\nOverall, Dr. Greenwald concludes that \"this kind of loose\noversight compromises patient care and is heavily dependent upon\ngood nursing staff-psychiatrist communication.  However, at PNH,\nnursing staff-psychiatrist communication is erratic and\nsuperficial.\"  There is little if any multidisciplinary\ninvolvement in psychiatric treatment decisionmaking at PNH.  We\nfound little evidence that the treating psychiatrist is aware of,\n\n- 9 -\nor has explored, considered and incorporated relevant and\nimportant nursing information.  The City's own on-site reviews\ndocument that the consult psychiatrist fails to consider\nimportant behavioral information contained in the nursing notes.\nIn addition, there is a general need for continuing\neducation among the PNH staff at large with respect to mental\nhealth and psychiatric concerns among its residents.  There is a\nconspicuous lack of continuing education and inservices regarding\nmental health issues at PNH.\nB.  Medical Care And Services At PNH Are Inadequate To Meet\nThe Residents' Needs\nPNH also fails to provide its residents with adequate and\nappropriate health care in a number of other areas.\n1.  Neurological Care Is Inadequate\nNeurological care and services at PNH are inadequate.  PNH\nprimary care physicians, rather than neurologists, provide most\nof the neurological care at the facility.  As a result, many\nresidents with neurological problems, including those with\ncomplex and difficult conditions, do not receive the needed\nspecialty services of a neurologist.  For example, the PNH\nphysicians did not refer to a neurologist a number of residents\nwho had drug levels that were chronically difficult to control.\nIn addition, PNH physicians often fail to adequately address\nresidents' anti-seizure medication where they have\nsub-therapeutic or above therapeutic levels.  For instance, for\none resident whose Dilantin level fluctuated from high to low to\nhigh again, the PNH physician failed to adjust the medication\ndose, failed to discuss an approach to deal with this problem,\nand failed to procure expert neurological consult help.  The same\ninadequate documentation and approach was present in the care of\nanother resident who exhibited a high Dilantin level and a\nsub-therapeutic Tegretol level.  As Dr. Adelman concludes for yet\nanother resident, \"there is a danger that this resident may be\nneedlessly exposed to medication that is not providing him with\nany benefit.\"  The City's own on-site reviews reveal a number of\nsimilar concerns surrounding neurological care at PNH, including\nconsults not being performed in a timely manner and inadequate\ndocumentation of laboratory tests.\nPNH also does not have a protocol for proper treatment of\nemergency seizure situations, known as \"status epilepticus.\"\nContrary to generally accepted practice, PNH uses intramuscular\ninjection to treat such emergency situations rather than\nintravenous treatment.  This practice places PNH residents at\nactive risk of harm.  In light of the number of PNH residents\nwith seizures and other neurological complications, the\n\n- 10 -\nfacility's deficiencies in neurological care compromise the\nhealth of a significant number of residents.\n2.  Interdisciplinary Communication Is Inadequate\nInterdisciplinary communication between physicians and other\nhealth care professionals at PNH is inadequate and does not\ncomport with generally accepted standards.  The City's\nSeptember 1995 on-site review reveals that  \"interdisciplinary\ncommunication is lacking, i.e., no follow-up by other disciplines\nafter findings or recommendations are made.\"  During our tour,\neven the PNH Medical Director admitted to us that the functioning\nof the interdisciplinary team needed improvement.\nPoor communication between the doctors and the nurses at PNH\nmay have contributed to the death of at least one PNH resident.\nDr. Adelman made this conclusion after reviewing the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of a resident who had been\nreceiving Coumadin, a blood thinning medication.  Despite the\npresence of blood in the resident's urine, PNH continued to\nprovide the resident with Coumadin, contrary to accepted\nprofessional standards.  As Dr. Adelman concluded, this death\nreveals \"a disturbing lack of understanding on the part of\nnursing about the meaning of  [blood in the urine], and therefore,\npoor communication with the  [PNH] physician.\"\n3.  Physician Orders Are Inappropriate, Incomplete, Unclear\nThe orders of the PNH physicians are often inappropriate,\nincomplete, or unclear.  For example, the City's October 1995\non-site review reveals that PNH physicians continue to rely\ninappropriately on verbal and telephone verbal orders rather than\nwritten orders for treatment.  The October on-site review also\nfound that physicians' medical diagnoses are often lacking on the\nphysician order sheet.  Moreover, Geri Mendelson, our nursing\nconsultant, concludes that physicians' orders are often not clear\nand that the nurses exacerbate the problem by not taking steps to\nclarify the orders before trying to implement them.  These\ndeficiencies create the danger that orders will not be carried\nout as intended, thus jeopardizing the health and welfare of the\nPNH residents who need appropriate treatment.\n4.  Medical Notes And Documentation Are Inadequate\nAs is true with psychiatric notes and documentation, PNH\ngeneral medical notes and documentation are also incomplete and\nfail to comport with generally accepted standards.  PNH physician\nnotes vary dramatically in quality and generally fail to express\nadequately the needed approach to care for specific issues and to\naddress abnormal medical findings appropriately.\n\n- 11 -\nThe City's November 1995 on-site review revealed  \"patterns\nof non-compliance\" with respect to chart notes and documentation.\nIn fact, the on-site review found deficiencies with physician\nprogress notes, physician orders, X-rays, labs and consults.\nSpecifically, the on-site review concluded that physicians'\norders were \"unacceptable\" and that the physicians' progress\nnotes revealed a lack of follow-up to problems identified by\nstaff.  The review also found that PPD  [purified protein\nderivative] documentation in the residents' charts is \"not\ncomplete.\"  During our expert tours of PNH, we also discovered\nthat a large number of resident charts contained no obvious\nrecord of PPD test results indicating the presence or absence of\ntuberculosis.  Although many of the charts had a designated sheet\nto track vaccinations and PPD tests, they were unfilled in half\nof the charts reviewed.  In light of the significant increase in\ntuberculosis in nursing homes, these deficiencies pose\nsignificant risk to PNH residents.\nPNH physicians are also failing to complete monthly notes in\nthe residents' charts on a timely basis.  The City's\nNovember 1995 on-site review found \"zero percent\" compliance with\nrespect to the completion of monthly summaries.  It also found no\nevaluation of current care plan goals and no review of\nsignificant resident issues or episodes occurring during the\nmonth.\nIn addition, PNH often fails to obtain timely laboratory\ndata and weights and to provide appropriate follow-up.  We\nuncovered a number of examples at PNH where there were\nunacceptably long delays in obtaining consult results, initiating\nmedical tests, obtaining the test results, and providing\nappropriate treatment.  As Dr. Adelman concludes, \"[a] better\nmechanism for tracking tests and obtaining test results in a\ntimely manner should be a priority.\"\n5.  Staffing And Resource Concerns\nState surveyors in June 1995 found the ratio of physicians\nto residents at PNH was extraordinarily poor; each PNH physician\nwas responsible for the health care of two hundred or more\nresidents.  Just prior to our tour, however, PNH quickly added\nphysicians to its staff.  The picture presented to us at the time\nof our tour was even more skewed because the resident census had\nbeen artificially reduced for months due to a ban on admissions\nand re-admissions that was imposed on PNH after the June 1995\ncertification survey.  At the time of our tour, re-admissions of\ndischarged PNH residents had just resumed, and new admissions\nwere about to start again.  Even so, the resident census at the\ntime of our tour was at least 150 residents below where PNH\nprojects it to be in the future.  Many of the residents scheduled\nto be re-admitted were some of the most medically fragile\nindividuals at the nursing home.  As Dr. Adelman suggests, given\n\n- 12 -\nthe artificially reduced census and the presence of new staff\nphysicians, a \"re-evaluation\" of the medical department should be\nconducted when the full resident census is reached.\nC.  Nursing Care And Services At PNH Fail To Meet Generally\nAccepted Practices\nThere are deficiencies in the delivery of nursing care and\nservices at PNH which breach generally accepted standards of\nclinical practice and which seriously jeopardize the residents.\n1.  Nurses Fail To Follow Standard Infection Control\nProcedures\nPNH nurses fail to adhere to universally accepted treatment\nprotocols with respect to infection control procedures and\nmaintaining aseptic conditions at treatment sites.  The PNH\nDirector of Nursing admitted to us that she has concerns about\nthe nursing staff's competency in and knowledge of proper wound\ncare to reduce the possibility of infection.  Our nursing\nconsultant concludes that \"the PNH nurses did not follow\ngenerally accepted procedures to reduce the risk of infection\n... and generally did not follow universally accepted procedures\nrelated to maintaining cleanliness and sterility ... Generally,\nthe PNH nurses ... did not demonstrate the knowledge or skills to\nprovide appropriate nursing services to residents.\"  The City's\nown November 1995 on-site review indicates that \"[t]reatments did\nnot meet standards of practice utilizing aseptic technique.\"  The\nCity's March on-site review again found that PNH staff do not\npractice Universal Precautions for infection control, emphasizing\nthat \"this area is of serious concern.\"  Once again, it is\ntroubling that PNH failed to correct this deficiency months after\nit was clearly cited as a problem.\n2.  Care Of Residents With Diabetes Is Inadequate\nPNH fails to provide adequate and acceptable health care to\nresidents with diabetes.  Specifically, the practice of\nevaluating blood sugars and providing subsequent treatment is not\nacceptable at PNH.  Our nursing consultant concludes that the\npractice of providing care and treatment to PNH residents with\ninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus  (a serious form of diabetes)\nis \"not acceptable,\" and that these residents are \"at great\nrisk.\"\nWe uncovered many incidents where PNH staff had administered\nincorrect and/or inaccurate doses of insulin, did not properly\nmonitor certain diabetic residents or inform the physician of\ntheir status, and generally did not accurately document insulin\nadministration.  In one case, PNH provided a resident with\ntwenty-two straight days of incorrect insulin doses.  For another\nresident who was suffering with an elevated blood sugar level,\n\n- 13 -\nPNH failed to provide an appropriate follow-up note about the\ncontinuing status of the resident or even a note indicating that\nthe physician had been notified.  Our nursing consultant\nconcludes that the nursing practice in this case was \"not\nacceptable,\" and if left to continue, \"could cause harm or even\ndeath to the resident.\"  The PNH nursing staff also improperly\ntreated another resident with low blood sugar without first\nobtaining a physician's order.  Our nursing consultant concludes\nthat because this was not done, \"the resident could have gone\ninto shock.\"  Dr. Adelman discovered multiple instances where PNH\nstaff failed to follow the generally accepted practice of calling\nthe supervising registered nurse and physician when residents'\ndiabetic levels were too low or too high.  We found a number of\nexamples where neither the nurse nor the physician even addressed\nabnormal blood glucose levels.  It appeared in each case that the\nphysician was never notified or not timely notified.  Consistent\nwith this finding, the City's October 1995 on-site review reveals\nthat even PNH nursing supervisors fail to obtain a physician's\norder before treating diabetic residents.\n3.  Medication Administration Is Inadequate And Nurses Fail\nTo Follow Physicians' Orders\nPNH nurses fail to consistently provide accurate and timely\nmedication administration to PNH residents.  The use and\nreporting of controlled drugs is not acceptable at PNH.  During\nour tour, we uncovered many different medication errors that\ncompromise resident care.  The City's on-site reviews also\nconclude that medication passes are unacceptable at PNH, with\nmedication error administration rates as high as thirty-eight\npercent.  One such review found that medication administration\nrecords and treatment administration records were all virtually\none hundred percent out of compliance with professional\nstandards.  The City's review concluded:  \"These areas reflect\nrepeated gaps in documentation, not just on one dose omission.\nThis is a serious liability and one that must be addressed\nimmediately.\"\nPNH nurses are also not meeting generally accepted standards\nbecause they routinely fail to follow physicians' orders which\nplaces the PNH residents in jeopardy.  During our tour, we\ndiscovered that PNH nurses had failed to perform a number of\nphysician-ordered treatments; there was no documentation in the\nresidents' charts as to why the treatments were not done or even\nthat the physician was notified.\n4.  Skin Care Is Inadequate\nPNH fails to perform needed skin assessments on new\nadmittees to determine which residents might be at risk for skin\nbreakdown.  Moreover, PNH residents at risk of developing\npressure ulcers do not receive required assistance from the\n\n- 14 -\nfacility to ensure that their activities of daily living are\nmaintained and that their individual physical and functional\nabilities do not decrease.  Once skin breakdowns occur, PNH does\nnot provide adequate and appropriate treatments.  Nurses do not\ntreat wounds from skin breakdowns with proper aseptic techniques\nand do not follow physicians' orders about turning and\nre-positioning residents.\n5.  Nutritional Intake Concerns\nPNH's practices in a number of areas are not adequate to\nmeet its residents' nutritional needs.  First, the facility fails\nto monitor residents' nutritional intake adequately during meals\nand fails to provide substitute meals for residents when\nappropriate.  The City has documented these deficiencies\nrepeatedly during its on-site reviews of PNH.  Residents have\nlost significant amounts of weight while under PNH's care, yet\nthe facility fails to weigh residents on a regular basis.  When\nit does weigh residents, the weights are often inaccurate.  Even\nin situations where a significant weight loss is actually\naccurately recorded, doctors, nurses, and dieticians do not\naddress the problem.  During our tour, the PNH dietician\nacknowledged that the facility has no formal mechanism to notify\nappropriate health care professionals that residents are losing\nweight.  The City has found other pervasive deficiencies in this\narea at PNH, including a failure to conduct appropriate\nnutritional assessments and to provide appropriate diets.\nSecond, PNH fails to provide adequate assessments and\ntreatment to residents who have swallowing disorders or who\ncannot eat orally.  For example, during its November on-site\nreview, the City found that the facility's therapist was not\nfollowing accepted standards of practice in performing screenings\nto identify residents with swallowing problems.  Other reviews\nhave documented deficiencies in PNH's practices with respect to\nresidents who are unable to eat and must be fed with a tube.  The\ndeficiencies include a failure to conduct adequate assessments of\nthese residents' dietary needs, a failure to provide residents\nwith sufficient calories, protein, vitamins and minerals, and a\nfailure to make a concerted effort to wean residents off of tube\nfeeders.\nFinally, during our tour, we also heard many complaints from\nresidents about the adequacy of food they receive.  The resident\ncouncil meeting minutes are rife with resident complaints about\nfood, drink and meals generally.  During our tour, we further\ndiscovered that PNH is failing to provide its residents with\nconsistently fresh drinking water.  We observed that the\nresidents were left to consume water that had been sitting around\nfor days in a styrofoam cup.\n\n- 15 -\n6.  Nurses Do Not Timely Respond To Resident Calls For Help\nA recurring refrain among residents was that PNH nurses and\nstaff did not respond to resident call bells in a timely manner.\nA number of residents stated that it has taken nurses over\nforty-five minutes to respond to resident calls for assistance.\nIn one case, a resident was forced to turn off his oxygen machine\nto sound a loud alarm just to get the attention of the staff.  He\nsaid he more regularly uses a flash light siren to attract the\nstaff after they fail to respond to his call bell.  We also found\nthat some call bells were not appropriately placed near the more\nimmobile residents so that they could access them.\n7.  Nursing Documentation Is Inadequate\nAs is true in the other disciplines discussed above, nursing\ndocumentation and charting is deficient at PNH.  The City's\nNovember 1995 on-site review reveals \"patterns of non-compliance\"\nwith respect to PNH nursing chart notes and documentation.  In\nfact, the on-site reviews found deficiencies with nursing history\nand assessment, nurses notes, monthly nursing summaries, weights\nand vital signs, medication and treatment cardexes, care plans,\ndietary and skin assessments.  Similar findings, including the\nneed for inservicing nursing staff about appropriate\ndocumentation, appear in earlier on-site City reviews of PNH.\n8.  Nurse Staffing Is Inadequate\nNurse staffing levels are unacceptable at PNH.  The City's\nown on-site review acknowledges that \" [s]taffing continues to be\nan issue.\"  At the time of our tour, there were many nursing\nvacancies and an unacceptably high use of contract nurses.  The\nPNH Director of Nursing admitted to us that current permanent\nnurse staffing is not sufficient and that the facility must rely\ninstead on contract nurses to meet residents' needs.  The figures\ncontained in the City's on-site reviews reveal \"significant\" use\nof contract agency nurses at PNH:  in October 1995, PNH used\nagency nurses for about twenty-six percent of its registered\nnurse positions, and used agency nurses for over seventy-one\npercent of its licensed practical nurse positions.  Not only is\nthe overuse of contract nurses inefficient and costly, but it\nalso compromises resident care.  The PNH Director of Nursing\nadmitted that the use of agency nurses poses problems with\ncontinuity of care.  The City's on-site review also concurs with\nthis conclusion.\n9.  Nurses Require Additional Education/Inservices\nNurses, indeed staff in a broad range of disciplines at PNH,\nneed better education about how best to care for PNH residents.\nDr. Adelman concluded that PNH nurses had insufficient knowledge\nand experience to meet the residents' needs.  Members of the PNH\n\n- 16 -\ninfection control team also acknowledged that staff education is\nan area that needs improvement at the facility.  Some of the\nother areas in need of additional training that PNH\nadministrators and staff identified include:  basic quality\nnursing care, assessment skills, prevention strategies,\ninterdisciplinary communication, general staff inservicing, and\ndocumentation.\nIn sum, the deficiencies in medical and nursing care at PNH\noutlined above constitute a systemic failure to meet residents'\nhealth care needs, in violation of their constitutional and\nfederal statutory rights.\nIV.  CERTAIN PNH RESIDENTS ARE NOT BEING SERVED IN THE MOST\nINTEGRATED SETTING APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEEDS\nFinally, some PNH residents' rights are being violated as a\nresult of their continuing confinement at the facility.  Pursuant\nto Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),\n42 U.S.C. § 12132, \"no qualified individual with a disability\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs,\nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination by any such entity.\"  Applicable ADA regulations\nprovide:  \"A public entity shall administer services, programs,\nand activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the\nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities.\"  28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(d).  In a recent case involving PNH, the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit held that Idell S., a PNH resident,\nhad a right under the ADA to receive the support services she\nneeded in her own home rather than being required to live in a\nnursing home to receive them since Pennsylvania already had a\nprogram to provide in-home attendant care services.  Helen L. v.\nDiDario, 46 F.3d 325  (3d Cir.), cert, denied,  U.S.  , 116 S.\nCt. 64  (1995) .\nThere is a group of individuals with physical disabilities\nat PNH, like Idell S. in the Helen L. case, who professionals\nhave evaluated and determined can live outside of the nursing\nhome with appropriate attendant care services.  Also like\nIdell S., the only reason these individuals must continue to live\nat PNH is because of a lack of available attendant care services\nin the Philadelphia area.  As the Federal Court of Appeals for\nthe Third Circuit has already decided, this is not an acceptable\nreason under the ADA to deny individuals the opportunity to be\nserved in a more integrated setting.  In addition, mentally ill\nPNH residents have not been evaluated by professionals to\ndetermine whether they can be served in a more integrated\nsetting.  The facility's failure to assess these individuals to\ndetermine whether continued confinement in a nursing home is\nnecessary or whether there is a more integrated setting\nappropriate to meet their needs is also a violation of the ADA.\n\n- 17 -\nV.  MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES\nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and to protect the\nrights of PNH residents, the following measures, at a minimum,\nneed to be implemented promptly.\n1.  PNH must fully comply with all applicable provisions of the\nMedicare and Medicaid statutes and their implementing regulations\nthat govern conditions of care at PNH.\n2.  PNH must ensure that the staff members are providing\nresidents with appropriate basic care services that meet the\nresidents' needs.\n3.  PNH must provide a safe environment for its residents.\nStaff members must adequately monitor and safeguard the\nresidents, especially those with histories of exhibiting\nbehaviors that cause injury to themselves or others.  Residents\nmust be protected from being victimized by other aggressive\nresidents.\n4.  PNH must provide residents with sufficient, meaningful\nactivities.  For those residents who abuse alcohol, PNH must\nprovide them with appropriate productive activities and\nprogramming to address their alcohol abuse.\n5.  PNH must ensure that bodily restraints are used only\npursuant to accepted professional standards and that they are\nnever used as punishment or for the convenience of staff.\nAppropriate physicians' orders must be obtained and followed\nbefore restraints are utilized.  The facility must ensure that\nresidents are released from any restraints at least every two\nhours.\n6.  PNH must provide adequate and appropriate psychiatric and\nmental health services in accordance with accepted professional\nstandards to residents who need such services.  PNH must procure\nadequate psychiatry consult hours to meet the needs of the\nresidents.  Psychotropic medication must only be used in\naccordance with accepted professional standards and where there\nis an appropriate psychiatric or neuropsychiatric diagnosis.  It\nmust not be used as punishment, in lieu of a training program,\nfor behavior control, or for the convenience of staff.  In order\nto accomplish this, PNH must:\na. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of each PNH resident\nreceiving psychotropic medication or who has documented\nmental illness; provide the resident with an appropriate\ndifferential diagnosis of mental illness;\nb. Develop an overall treatment plan for each resident with\na diagnosis of mental illness that describes clear,\n\n- 18 -\nobjective and measurable short-term, intermediate and long\nrange goals and objectives for each resident, including time\nframes for the achievement of each;\nc. Provide on-going monitoring of the efficacy of treatment\nand make revisions in the treatment plan when warranted;\nd. Document that, prior to using psychotropic medication for\nbehavior modification, other, less restrictive techniques\nhave been systematically tried and have been demonstrated to\nbe ineffective;\ne. Develop and implement an adequate system for detecting,\nreporting, and responding to any drug-induced side effects\nof psychotropic medication; and\nf. Provide an adequate array of non-pharmacological mental\nhealth services for those residents who need them, with\nspecial emphasis on those individuals who have exhibited\naggressive or other maladaptive behaviors.\n7.  PNH must ensure that its residents receive adequate\npreventive, chronic, routine, acute, and emergency medical care\nin accordance with generally accepted standards of care.  PNH\nmust ensure adequate and appropriate interdisciplinary\ncommunication among relevant professionals, and PNH physicians\nmust write appropriate, complete and clear orders pursuant to\ngenerally accepted practice.  Further, PNH primary care\nphysicians must:\na. Conduct comprehensive evaluations of all residents for\nwhom they are responsible;\nb. Determine what specialized medical services are required\nfor the residents for whom they are responsible alid ensure\nthat such services are timely provided whenever necessary to\nevaluate or treat the individual's medical problems;\nc. Ensure that each individual has an integrated medical\nplan of care to address any chronic medical problem; and\nd. Ensure that each individual's medical status and progress\nin response to the individual's medical plan of care is\nregularly and adequately reviewed.\nIn concert with the above steps, PNH must provide adequate\nand appropriate routine, chronic, and emergency seizure\nmanagement to all individuals with epilepsy at PNH in accordance\nwith accepted professional standards of care.  Specifically, the\nCity must procure a sufficient number of neurology consult hours\nto meet the needs of the residents, provide adequate seizure\ndocumentation and recordkeeping, and improve diagnostic\n\n- 19 -\ntechniques.  PNH must put in place an emergency protocol for the\ntreatment of status epilepticus and \"inservice\" staff on how to\nimplement it.  PNH must immediately stop the use of intramuscular\nmedication to treat status.\n8.  PNH must ensure that its residents receive adequate nursing\ncare, and that nurses perform their responsibilities in keeping\nwith accepted professional standards of care by adequately\nidentifying health care problems, notifying physicians of health\ncare problems, monitoring and intervening to ameliorate such\nproblems, and keeping appropriate records of residents' health\ncare status.  To this end, PNH nurses must:\na. Conduct adequate, comprehensive assessments;\nb. Develop nursing diagnoses and develop and implement\nadequate and appropriate comprehensive nursing care plans to\naddress each resident's health care needs;\nc. Routinely perform on-going monitoring of serious medical\nconditions, including such basic procedures as taking vital\nsigns and measuring weights;\nd. Develop and implement a system for recording important\ninformation about a resident's status to monitor changes;\ne. Communicate essential information to physicians; and\nf. Follow physicians' orders.\nIn addition, PNH nurses and staff must ensure that they\nfollow standard infection control procedures, maintain aseptic\ntechnique and conditions at treatment sites, ensure that diabetic\nresidents receive appropriate care and services, reduce\nmedication errors, perform skin care assessments and ongoing\ntreatments and therapy to prevent skin breakdown, and respond\npromptly to resident calls for assistance.  The City must also\nprocure sufficient nursing staff to ensure adequate continuity of\nresident care so that the facility is no longer reliant on\ntemporary contract nurses.\n9.  PNH must ensure that residents' nutritional intake is\nadequate, that weights are routinely and accurately recorded, and\nthat residents receive appropriate diets, adequate amounts of\nfood, and sufficient quantities of fresh water to ensure proper\nhydration.  In addition, PNH must assess and treat residents with\nswallowing problems and residents who are unable to eat orally in\naccordance with accepted professional procedures.\n10.  PNH must establish and maintain an adequate, unified record\nfor each individual that comports with accepted professional\nstandards and includes current information with respect to the\n\n- 20 -\nindividual's care, medical treatment, and training, and must\nrequire staff to utilize such records in making care, medical\ntreatment and training decisions.\n11.  The City must ensure that a sufficient number of\nprofessional and non-professional staff, including outside\nconsultants, are employed to fully meet the needs of the PNH\nresidents.\n12.  PNH must comply with the clinical practice guidelines on the\ntreatment of pressure ulcers promulgated by the Public Health\nService of the United States Department of Health and Human\nServices.\n13.  PNH must ensure that the staff members are adequately\ntrained to perform its duties.  PNH must implement a training\nprogram for all personnel, including physicians, nurses and\ndieticians regarding, at a minimum, nutrition, wound care and\ninfection control, abuse and neglect, appropriate drug therapies\nfor the elderly, mental health needs of residents, and a\ncoordinated interdisciplinary approach to providing care to\nresidents.\n14.  PNH must implement professional decisions that a resident\ncan be served in a more integrated setting by transferring the\nresident to the alternative setting.  The City of Philadelphia\nmust ensure that before any resident is transferred to a more\nintegrated setting, the setting is capable of meeting the\nresident's needs and, once the transfer takes place, that the\nresident's needs are met.  Residents who are mentally ill must be\nassessed to determine whether they are being served in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.\nThe remedial measures outlined above are the minimal steps\nneeded to redress the constitutional and statutory deficiencies\nat PNH.  In order to ensure compliance with the remedial\nmeasures, an effective monitoring and reporting scheme is\nessential.\nGiven our positive experience with the City thus far, we\nhope to be able to resolve this matter amicably and\ncooperatively.  As such, we will be contacting your attorneys in\nthe near future to arrange a meeting to discuss in greater detail\nthe measures needed to fully remedy the deficiencies outlined\nabove.  We look forward to working with you to resolve this\nmatter in a reasonable and practical manner.\n\n- 21 -\nIf you have any questions, please contact Richard Farano at\n202-307-3116, or David R.

The denominator Is called \"opportunities for\nerrors\" and includes all the doses the survey team observed being administered plus the\ndoses ordered but not administered.

Follow three general guidelines in determining whether a\nDedication error la significant or not:\no  Resident Condition.—The resident's condition Is an important factor to\ntake into consideration.  For example, a potent diuretic erroneously adnlniatered to a\ndehydrated resident may have serious consequences, but If administered to a resident\nwith a normal fluid balance may not.  If the resident's condition requires rigid\ncontrol, a single Biased or wrong dose can be highly significant.\no  Drug Category.--If the drug Is from a category that usually requires the\nresident to be titrated to a specific blood level, a single medication error could\nalter that level and precipitate a reoccurrence of symptoms or toxlclty.  This is\neapeclally important if the half life of the drug is short.  Examples of drug\ncategories which require titration of resident blood levels Include anticonvulaants,\nanticoagulants, and antiarrhythmlc, anti-anginal and antlglaucoma agents.\no  Frequency of Error.—If an error is occurring with any frequency, there Is\nmore reason to classify the error as significant.  For example, if a resident's drug\nwas omitted several times, as verified by reconciling the number of tablets delivered\nwith the number administered, classifying that error as significant would be more in\norder.  This conclusion should be considered In concert with the resident's condition\nand the drug category.\nExamples of Significant and Non-Slgnlfleant Medication Errors.--Examples of medication\nerrors that have actually occurred In long tern care facilities are presented below.\nSome of these errors are identified as significant.  This designation is based on\nexpert opinion without regard to the atstus of the resident.  Most experts concluded\nthat the significance of these errors. In and of themselves, have a high potential for\ncreating problems for the typical long term care facility resident.  Those errors\nIdentified as nonsignificant have also been designated primarily on the basis of the\nnature of the drug.  Resident status and frequency of error could classify these errors\nas significant.\nRev. 274 06-95 PP 129\n\nGUIDANCE TO SURVEYORS - LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES\nTAG\nNUMBER REGULATION GUIDAHCB TO SURVEYORS\nF333 Omissions (Drug ordered but not administered at least once):\nCont.\nDRUG ORDER  SIGNIFICANCE\nHaldol lag BID NS*\nMotrin 400ng TID NS\nQuinldlne 200mg TID S\"\nTearisol Drops 2 both eyes TID NS\nIndocin 25ng TID pc NS\nLioresal lOng TID NS\nThorazine 25mg BID MS\nAmpicillin 500mg TID NS\nHetamucll one packet BID NS\nInderal 20ag one every 6 hours S\nMultlvitanin one daily NS\nMylanta Susp. one ox., TID AC NS\nHitrol Olnt. one inch S\nLlbrlua lOng one TID NS\nCortlsporin Otic drop 4 to 5\nleft ear QID NS\nAldactone 25mg QID NS\nNot Significant\nSignificant\nUnauthorized Drug (Drugs administered without a physician's order):\nDRUG ORDER  SIGNIFICANCE\nFeosol NS\nCounadln 4ng S\nLasix 40BKJ S\nZylopria lOOmg NS\nTylenol 5 gr NS\nTrlavll 4-25 NS\nMultlvitamins NS\nMotrin 400ng NS\nRev. 274 06-95 PP-130\n\nGUIDANCE TO SURVEYORS - LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES\nTAG\nNUMBER REGULATION GUIDANCE TO SURVEYORS\nF333 Wrong Dose:\nCont.

Detection of blank\nspaces on a medication administration record does not constitute the detection of\nactual medication errors.  Paper review only Identifies possible errors.  Experience\nhas shown that facility staff are likely to correct the paper rather than correct the\nerrors.\nObservation Technique. —The survey team must know without doubt, what druga, In what\nstrength, and dosage forms, are being administered.  This Is accomplished prior to drug\nadministration and may be done In a nunber of ways depending on the drug distribution\nsystem used (e.g. unit dose, vial system, punch card).\n1.  Identify the drug product. There are two principal ways to do this. In\nmost cases, they are used In combination:\no Identify the product by Its size, shape, and color. Many drug products\nare Identifiable by their distinctive site, shape, or color. This technique Is\nproblematic because not all drugs have distinctive slzeB, shapes, or color.\no Identify the product by observing the label. When the punch card or the\nunit dose systen is used, the survey team can usually observe the label and adequately\nIdentify the drug product.  When the vial system Is used, observing the label Is\nsometimes more difficult.  Ask the nurse to identify the medication being administered.\n2.  Observe and record the administration of druga (\"pass\").  Follow the person\nadministering drugs and observe residents receiving drugs (e.g., actually swallowing\noral dosage forms).  Be neutral and as unobtrusive as possible during this process.\nMake every effort to observe residents during several different drug \"passes\" so the\nsurvey team will have an assessment of the entire facility rather than one staff\non one drug pass.\nNote every detail on the surveyor's record of the drug administration.  For example,\n\"eye drops administered in both eyes\" or \"nurse took pulse,\" or \"resident swallowed\nnitroglycerin\" or \"all druga crushed and administered In apple sauce.\"\nRev. 274 06-95 PP-U3\n\nGUIDANCE TO SURVEYORS - LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES\nTAG\nNUMBER REGULATION GUIDANCE TO SURVEYORS\nF333 Identifying residents can present a problem.

Reconcile the surveyor's record of observation with physician's orders.\nCompare the record of observation with the n>st current signed orders for drugs. This\ncomparison Involves two distinct activities:'\no For each drug on the surveyor's list: Was It administered according to\nthe physician's orders?  For example. In the correct strength, by the correct route?\nWas there a valid order for the drug?  Was the drug the correct one?\no For drugs not on surveyor's list:  Are there orders for drugs that should\nhave been administered, but were not?  Examine the record for drug orders that ware not\nadministered and should have been.  Such circumstances represent omitted doses - one of\nthe aost frequent types of errors.\nThe surveyor should now have a complete record of what was observed and what\nshould have occurred according to the physicians' orders.  Determine the number\nof errors by adding the errors on each resident.  Before concluding for certain\nthat an error has occurred, discuss the apparent error with the nurse who\nadministered  the drugs. There may be a logical explanation for an apparent\nerror.  For example, the surveyor observed that a resident had received Laslx 20\nmg, but the order was for 40 mg.  This was an apparent error In dosage. But the\nnurse showed the surveyor another more recent order which discontinued the 40 mg\norder and replaced it with a 20 mg order.\n4.  Reporting Errors - Describe to the facility each error that the survey team\ndetects (e.g., Mary Jones received digoxln In 0.125 Instead of 0.25 mg). The\nsurvey team Is not required to analyze the errors and come to any conclusions on\nhow the facility can correct them.  Do not attempt to categorize errors Into\nvarious classifications (e.g., wrong dose, wrong resident).  Stress that an\nerror occurred and that future errors must be avoided.\n5.  Observe Horning \"Pass\" - It is preferable to watch the morning drug\nadministration pass because that la when most doses are administered In long\nterm care facilities and, hence, offers the greatest opportunity to observe\nerrors and conserve survey time.\n6.  Observe Several Individuals - Strive to observe several individuals\nadministering drugs in the facility so that an assessment of medication errors\nwill be more broadly based.  This requires observation of several \"passes\" at\nthe same time or at different times of the day.\nRev. 274 06-95 PP-134\n\nGUIDANCE TO 8URVEYORS - LOWO TERM CARE FACILITIES\nTAQ\nHU4BER REGULATION OUIDAMCB TO SURVEYORS\n333 Poae Reconciliation Technique:  Supplement to the Observation Technique. —When an\nCont. omission error has been detected through the observation technique, the dose\nreconciliation technique can sometimes enable the auxvey team to learn how frequently\nan error has occurred In the past.

Develop a process to ensure compliance with State survey requirements\nwith regard to environmental standards relating to Resident dignity and\nquality of life issues.\n2.  Develop a process to maintain routine compliance through internal\nmonitoring.\n3.  Provide and encourage involvement of every clinical and non-clinical\ndepartment\nParticipants:\nThe rounds will be initiated by inter-disciplinary teams, composed of members from\nthe following departments:\n1.  Nursing\n2.  Infection Control\n3.  Administration\n4.  Plant Operations\n5.  Environmental Services\n6.  Recreation Therapy\n7.  Fiscal Department\n8.  Human Resources\n9.  Central Supply\n10.

Every resident and non-resident unit( except a dietary department) has a\nteam composed of at least four to five team members, a team leader and if\npossible, one alternate team member.\n2.  Team leaders are individuals from Administration &/or management\nAudit Tool:\nA standardized audit tool will be utilized during team rounds.  The audit tool is\ncomposed of those items which evaluate  key environmental and infection control\npractices.  The audit tool will indicate which area did not meet institutional\nstandards and provide space to incorporate action to correct those noncompliant\nareas, (see copy of audit tool attached )\n\npage two of two\nEnvironmental Round Process\nRounding process:\nRounding will be done daily on each unit.  By the end of every week, all units will\nhave been completely evaluated.  The specifics of the process are as follows:\n1.  Each day, one team member conducts rounds on every unit.\n2.  Resident rooms on each unit are divided among unit team members.\nTeam members visit community areas and assigned rooms/residents, on\nassigned day.\n3.  Before beginning rounds, the team member asks the Unit Manager or\nlicensed staff on the resident floors or the director/manager  of the non-\nresident floors, to select one person working on the unit to accompany and\nassist with rounds.\n4.  Any item that can be easily fixed on the rounds is corrected(example:\ntowel on a bathroom floor is picked up and placed in dirty linen).\n5.  Following rounds, all staff available on theunit along with a Unit Manager\nor licensed personnel  on resident units and manager/director on non-\nresident  units, will gather  for a 3-5 minute meeting to discuss findings.\nThe  Unit  Manager or licensed personnel &/or  director/manager will\nassign  corrective actions and document actions on  rounds form.  The\nUnit Manager/licensed personal/director/manager will communicate\nconcerns, corrective actions and system changes with all shift supervisors\nand unit staffs.\n6.  One copy of the rounds form is kept on the floor. Other copies will go to\nAdministration, team leaders, Director of Nurses, Director of\nHousekeeping, Director of Plant Operations and Director of Quality\nImprovement, for follow-up.\n7.  Team leaders will meet weekly for the first two months to discuss system\nissues identified.  Team leaders will explore systems improvement ideas\nwith unit staff.\n8.

Census  must  be  utilized  every  shift  by the Unit  Manager  or Charge  Nurse to\naccount for each resident on each unit.  (See attached sample)\n2.  Census  rounds will be done at 3:00  p.m. , 11:00 p.m. and 7:00  a.m. with  the\nCharge Nurse going off-duty and the Charge Nurse coming on duty.  During these\nrounds resident whereabouts are to be accounted for by noting a checkmark  (•)\nin the appropriate column on the resident identification log.  The checkmark  (•)\nmeans that the resident is physically present on his/her assigned unit.\nIf the resident  is in a location in the facility, other than their assigned unit, or at\nanother facility for doctors appointments, programs, procedures, etc., their location\nis to be recorded in the log.\nFor example:\n•  If the resident is on the Patio record PATIO\n•  if the resident is in the X-ray Department record X-RAY\n•  If the resident is at Einstein Program record EINSTEIN\n•  If the resident  is at Episcopal Hospital Emergency Room record EH/ER\n•  If the resident was admitted to a hospital record ADMITTED\n•  If the resident was transferred to another unit record TRANSFER/UNIT\n•  if the resident was discharged record DISCHARGED\n•  If the resident expired record EXPIRED\n\nWhen rounds arr completed, the Charge Nurse coming on-auty ana me onarge\nNurse going-off  duty are to affix their signature at the bottom of the log labeled\n\"SIGNATURES\" in the appropriate column.\n3.  Unit Managers/Shift Supervisor are responsible to verify that the resident census\nand presence in the facility is accurate.\nThe  census  report  and  resident  identification  log  will  be  utilized  by  Unit\nManager/Shift  Supervisor each shift as a check that rounds are conducted and\neach resident is accounted for on each unit.\nUnit Manager and Shift Supervisor are also responsible to conduct room-to-room\nrounds.  At the completion of rounds the Unit Manager/Shift Supervisor will affix\ntheir  signtures  on  the  bottom  of  the log labeled \"UM/SUP\"  in the  appropriate\ncolumn.\n4.  Any resident not accounted for will be reported to the Unit Manager or Supervisor\nand a search of the building and grounds will be conducted immediately.\n5.  Once it has been determined that the resident is not in the building nor on the\ngrounds, the Unit manager or nursing Supervisor will contact the following:  from\nthe hours of 7:00 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.; Administrator, Director of Nursing, attending\nphysician, responsible relative and from the hours of 3:00 p.m. - 11:30 p.m. and\n11:00 p.m. - 7:30 a.m.; Administrator on call, Nurse Administrator on call, attending\nphysician, responsible  relative.  If the resident is determined to be AWOL, the\nDepartment of Health and police are notified.\n6.  An incident report will be completed and an investigation as to the causes will be\nconducted.  Trending  reports  will  be  completed  and  presented  to  Quality\nAssurance committee on a quarterly basis.\n7.

Today's agreement, which is subject to approval by\nthe Court, resolves all allegations in the lawsuit\n\"Almost every American knows a person living in a nursing home,\" said BUI Lann Lee,\nActing Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"When dose family members are placed in\nnursing homes, we trust they are being treated properly.

PATRICK\nASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\nCIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION\nFROM:  JAMES G. SHEEHAN\nASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY\nCHIEF, CIVIL DIVISION\nDAVID R. HOFFMAN\nASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY\nRE:  PHILADELPHIA NURSING HOME\nI am writing to request the immediate intervention of the\nDepartment of Justice in the Philadelphia Nursing Home (PNH),\nGirard and Corinthian Streets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  An\ninvestigation by the Department into the conditions at PNH,\npursuant to its authority under the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et\nseq. .  is necessitated by recent findings at the facility as well\nas concerns raised by advocates of those residing in the\nfacility.  PNH is a city-owned facility which has delegated\nmanagerial functions to Episcopal Long Term Care, a subsidiary of\nEpiscopal Hospital.  There are approximately 3 60 individuals\ncurrently residing at PNH.\nBACKGROUND\nPNH is the only city-owned nursing facility in the City\nof Philadelphia.  PNH has a population mix of elderly,\ndevelopmentally disabled, HIV/AIDS patients, accident victims and\nthose suffering from mental impairments.  The residents range in\nages from .21 to over 90 years of age.  .. .\n\nFrom July 1994 until December 1994, the census  increased\nby 150 residents, to over 480.  There are, however, only 2\nattending physicians to care for the entire resident  population\nwith the exception of one other physicians who is treating only\none resident.\nA survey of the facility was performed on the  following\ndates; June 1-2, 5-16.  On June 13, 1995, the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania Department of Health found that there is a  \"serious\nand immediate threat to residents.\"  On July 14, 1995, the Health\nCare Financing Administration, based upon a revisit by the\nstate's Department of Health found that the immediate threat to\nresident health and safety had been removed but that 9 level A\ndeficiencies remained.  These deficiencies involved Quality of\nCare, Quality of Life, Nursing Services, Dietary Services,\nInfection Control, Resident Behavior and Facility Practices of\nthe nursing home.\nAs a result of the survey, the census at PNH dropped  to\napproximately  360 residents from over 480.  Based  upon\ninformation supplied by the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program,  it\nis estimated that approximately  100 residents of PNH were\ntransferred to local hospitals from PNH based upon their medical\ncondition as discovered by the Department of Health surveyors.\nTHE JUNE SURVEY  RESULTS\nThe nursing home survey conducted  in June  found\nmultiple serious deficiencies  including, but not limited to:\nResident to Resident Abuse:\n(a)  The rape of a 89 year old resident;\n(b)  The infliction of cigarette burns on two residents;\n(c)  An elderly diabetic resident was hit in the face and\neye.\nEven more disturbing was the fact that there were no reports\nfiled by the facility nor was there any intervention by the\nfacility in any of these cases.\nQuality of Care:\n(a)  Residents with decubitus ulcers were not identified by\nstaff, i.e., 14 out of 29 targeted residents had Stage II\ndecubitus ulcers found by the surveyors that were never noted by\nthe  facility;\n(b)  One resident, who was critically ill, was observed lying\nin bed on his right side without being turned and repositioned\n\nfor almost three hours.  Additionally, pressure relieving devices\nbetween the resident's knees and legs were not provided.  The\nresident was also incontinent of bowel, had not been bathed and\na strong body odor was present.  Within a two week period, the\nresident had developed four Stage II decubitus ulcers;\n(c)  Reports of pressure sores were incomplete or inaccurate\nso proper tracking and cause of pressure sores advancing from the\nStage II to the Stage IV level was impossible;\n(d)  One resident had abnormal laboratory values evidencing\nacute renal failure that was never communicated to physician.\nUpon learning of the lab values, the resident was immediately\nhospitalized;\n(e)  Residents are at nutritional risk.  One resident had an\nunexplained loss of weight of over thirty  (3 0) pounds in less\nthan three months while another resident lost over 21 pounds in 2\nmonths.  Additionally, one resident did not have food served even\nthough the resident was in the restorative feeding program.  This\nresident has bilateral gangrene of the lower extremities, at\nleast 5 decubitus ulcers on both legs, including 4 Stage IV\npressure sores.  Protein and food consumption, critical elements\nin good wound healing, were unable to be reviewed since the\ndocuments were inaccurate and missing information;\n(f)  The nursing staff failed to turn and reposition\nresidents, provide incontinence care, and release residents from\nrestraints in a timely fashion.\nQuality of Life:\nResidents throughout the facility were observed with genitals,\nbuttocks, thighs and backs exposed to other residents, staff and\nvisitors.\nResidents wore soiled and torn clothing.\nResidents were not regularly bathed.\nCONTINUING NATURE OP DEFICIENCIES:\nThe survey noted that \"all deficiencies cited during the July\n18, 1994, Medicare, Medicaid and State Licensure Survey remained\nin noncompliance on this survey.\"\nAdditionally, as of July 14, 1994, all Level A deficiencies\nremained after the facility was re-surveyed in July.\n\nJULY MEETING WITH ADVOCATES\nOn July 18, 1995, a meeting was held at the U.S. Attorney's\nOffice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that included\nrepresentatives from advocacy groups for the elderly  (Long-Term\nCare Ombudsman Program), developmentally disabled, and AIDS\npatients.  The meeting was convened to gather information as to\nthe day-to-day occurrences at PNH and the attempts made by the\nadvocacy community to rectify the conditions at PNH.  All of the\nrepresentatives found the conditions at PNH to be inadequate,\nappalling and also emphasized that staff at PNH was overwhelmed.\nIn addition to the survey findings, a summary of the\ninformation supplied at the meeting evidenced the fact that:\n(a) residents are being discharged to the community in a\nseptic condition and that their discharge planning \"almost killed\na few people\";\n(b) residents are not receiving physical or occupational\ntherapy and physician consultations are simply not occurring\nthereby jeopardizing residents1 health;\n(c) staff was unaware of psychiatric and/or psychological\nhistories of residents thereby offering no proper treatment and\nendangering other residents;\n(d) the vast majority of staff was temporary in nature\nthereby creating a lack of familiarity with resident needs and\nconditions;\n(e) the nursing home administrator was extremely difficult\nto reach with complaints and was, in fact, non-responsive;\n(f) the physicians responsible for the provisions of care do\nnot know what is going on with the residents' medical conditions\nand therefore, proper medical care is not being provided;\n(g) the food at PNH is inedible based on taste, preparation\nand delivery and as such, residents are at nutritional risk as\nevidenced by the survey results.\nSEl\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased upon the information compiled to date, it is apparent\nthat the inadequate provision of quality care to the residents of\nPNH necessitates an investigation by the Office of Civil Rights\npursuant to the authority under CRIPA.  I offer my continued\nassistance in attempting to rectify the intolerable conditions at\nPNH.  The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania has been apprised of the circumstances surrounding\nthis request.",

Defendant EPISCOPAL LONG TERM CARE (\"ELTC\") is the\noperator of PNH pursuant to a contract with the City, and is\nresponsible for the day-to-day operations of PNH.\n- 3 -\n\n12.  The individual Defendants named in 11 9 and 10 above\nare officers of the Executive Branch of the City of Philadelphia\nand are sued in their official capacities.\n13.  PNH is an institution as that term is defined in\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1997(1)(A), (1)(B)(i) and (1)(B)(v).\n14.  Defendants are legally responsible, in whole or in\npart, for the operation of and conditions at PNH, as well as for\nthe care and treatment of persons residing at that institution.\n15.  At all relevant times, Defendants have acted or failed\nto act, as alleged herein, under color of state law.\nNURSING HOME REFORM ACT\n16.  The Nursing Home Reform Act (the \"Act\") mandates that\nnursing facilities comply with federal requirements relating to\nthe provision of services.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r et seg.  See also\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3 fit 2&Q-  Specifically, in terms of the\nquality of life for residents of nursing facilities, the Act\nstates that: \"A nursing facility must care for its residents in\nsuch a manner and in such an environment as will promote\nmaintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each\nresident.\"  42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(1)(A).  See also 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1395i-3(b)(1)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 483.15.\n- 4 -\n\n17.  In addition, the Act mandates that a nursing facility:\nprovide services and activities to attain or\nmaintain the highest practicable physical, mental,\nand psychosocial well-being of each resident, in\naccordance with a written plan of care which —\n(A)  describes the medical, nursing,'- and\npsychosocial needs of the resident and\nhow such needs will be met;...\n42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(2)(A).  See also 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1395i-3(b)(2)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 483.25.\n18.  A duty is placed on the nursing facility to fulfill the\nresidents' care plans by providing, or arranging for the\nprovision of, inter alia, nursing and related services and\nmedically-related social services that attain or maintain the\nhighest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being\nof each resident, pharmaceutical services, and dietary services\nthat assure that the meals meet the daily nutritional and special\ndietary needs of each resident, and treatment and services\nrequired by residents with mental illness and/or mental\nretardation.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(4)(A)(i-vii).  See also\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(b)(4)(A)(i-vii).\n19.  The Act mandates that nursing homes that participate in\nthe Medical Assistance Program (\"Medicaid\") and the Medicare\nProgram meet certain specific requirements in order to qualify\nfor such participation.  These requirements are set forth at\n- 5 -\n\n42 C.F.R. §§ 483.1 afc. seg. and \"serve as the basis for survey-\nactivities for the purpose of determining whether a facility\nmeets the requirements for participation in Medicare and\nMedicaid.\"  42 C.F.R. § 483.Kb).\n20.  Federal regulations, when addressing quality of care\nconcerns, mandate that \"[e]ach resident must receive and the\nfacility must provide the necessary care and services to attain\nor maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and\npsychosocial well-being, in accordance with the comprehensive\nassessment and plan of care.\"  42 C.F.R. § 483.25.\n21.  As a pre-requisite to enrollment as a provider in the\nMedicaid Program, PNH entered into a provider agreement and\nagreed to the following provisions:\n1.  That the submission by, or on behalf of, the\nFacility of any claim, either by hard copy or\nelectronic means, shall be certification that the\nservices or items from which payment is claimed\nactually were provided to the person identified as\na medical assistance resident by the person or\nentity identified as the Facility on the dates\nindicated.\n*******\n5.  That the Facility's participation in the\n[Medicaid] Program is subject to the laws and\nregulations effective as to the period of\nparticipation, including all of those that may be\neffective after the date of the agreement and that\nthe Facility has the responsibility to know the\nlaw with respect to participation in the\n[Medicaid] Program.\n- 6 -\n\n22.  At all times relevant to this action, PNH was a\n\"provider\" with a valid provider agreement with the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Public Welfare.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nCOUNT I: CIVIL RIGHTS OF INSTITUTIONALIZED PERSONS ACT\n23.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein by\nreference as if fully set forth.\n24.  Defendants have failed to ensure the reasonable safety\nand personal security of the PNH residents.  Defendants have\nfailed to adequately supervise, monitor and protect the residents\nfrom harm and risk of harm.\n25.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate basic care\nand related services to PNH residents.\n26.  Defendants have failed to provide residents with\nadequate, appropriate and meaningful activities.\n27.  Defendants have failed to ensure that PNH residents are\nfree from undue or unreasonable restraint and that restraints are\nadministered to PNH residents by appropriately qualified\nprofessionals in keeping with accepted professional standards,\nand are not used as punishment, in lieu of treatment, or for the\nconvenience of staff.\n- 7 -\n\n28.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate mental\nhealth care and services to PNH residents.\n29.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate medical and\nhealth care and services to PNH residents and to ensure that\nmedications are prescribed and administered to PNH residents by\nappropriately qualified professionals in keeping with accepted\nprofessional standards, and are not used as punishment, in lieu\nof treatment, or for the convenience of staff.\n30.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate nursing care\nand services to PNH residents.\n31.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate physical and\noccupational therapy services to PNH residents.\n32.  Defendants have failed to provide a sufficient number\nof adequately trained professional and direct care staff to\nrender the essential care and treatment outlined above in\nparagraphs 24 through 31.\n33.  Defendants have failed to ensure that PNH residents are\nevaluated by appropriate professionals for placement in the most\nintegrated setting and appropriately placed into the most\nintegrated setting according to their individualized needs.\n34.  Defendants have failed to meet the requirements of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n- 8 -\n\n§§ 12101 fit seq.  and the regulations promulgated pursuant\ne\nthereto, by excluding the PNH residents, by reason of their\ndisability, from participation in or by denying them the benefits\nof the services, programs, or activities of the City, or by\nsubjecting them to discrimination, and by failing to administer\nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to their needs.

The acts and omissions alleged in paragraphs 24 through\n36 infringe upon the PNH residents' legal rights and substantive\nliberty interests and constitute resistance to their full\nenjoyment of rights, privileges or immunities secured or\nprotected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and\n- 9 -\n\ndeprive the PNH residents of such rights, privileges or\nimmunities.\n38.  Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will\ncontinue to engage in the conduct and practices set forth in\nparagraphs 24 through 36 that deprive residents of PNH of their\nlegal rights under law and the rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured or protected by the Constitution of the United States,\nand cause irreparable harm to PNH residents.\nCOUNT TI; FALSE CLAIMS ACT\n39.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein by\nreference as if fully set forth.\n40.  The United States charges that the Defendants submitted\nor caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the\nUnited States for payment for care that was not adequately\nrendered to elderly individuals, to individuals with special\nneeds, to individuals with developmental disabilities, and to\nindividuals with mental illness residing at PNH.\n41.  PNH is a licensed long-term care (nursing) facility\nunder federal and state law and is certified to participate in\nthe Medicaid and Medicare Programs.\n42.  A synopsis of the factual basis for which this cause of\naction is based is incorporated herein and is attached hereto as\n- 10 -\n\nExhibit A.\n43.  The provision of adequate medical care, nursing care\nand psychiatric care, pertaining to the appropriate use of\npsychotropic drugs for PNH residents and monitoring; for side-\neffects of these medications, was the responsibility of PNH\nmedical and nursing staff.\n44.  The provision of adequate wound care to PNH residents\nwas the responsibility of the PNH nursing and medical staff.\n45.  The provision of adequate nutrition to PNH residents\nwas the responsibility of not only the PNH nutritionists and\ndietary staff but included the PNH nursing and medical staff as\nwell.\n46.  The provision of a safe environment in which PNH\nresidents were free from any abuse, included all PNH disciplines,\nincluding but not limited to PNH medical, nursing, and facility\nmanagement staff.\n47.  Defendants' agents and/or employees were responsible\nfor the provision of medical care, nursing care, psychiatric\ncare, appropriate medications and monitoring thereof, wound care,\nnutritional services, and safe conditions for all of the PNH\nresidents.\n48.  Defendants' agents and/or employees billed the United\n- 11 -\n\nStates  (through the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare)\nfor care provided to the PNH residents for reimbursement by the\nMedicaid Program.  Defendants' agents and/or employees billed the\nUnited States for care provided to the PNH resident's for\nreimbursement by the Medicare Program.\n49.  Defendants' agents and/or employees submitted or caused\nto be submitted false or fraudulent claims to the Medicaid and\nMedicare Programs for payment or approval of the provision of\nmedical care, nursing care, psychiatric care, appropriate\nmedications and monitoring thereof, wound care, nutritional\nservices, and safe conditions that were not adequately rendered\nto PNH residents for the time period January 1995 through\nDecember 1996.\n50.  Defendant City of Philadelphia, as licensee for PNH,\nwas responsible for the care rendered to residents at PNH and\nsubmitted or caused to be submitted the repeated submission of\nfalse or fraudulent claims for payment or approval to the\nMedicaid and Medicare Programs, for the provision of medical\ncare, nursing care, psychiatric care, appropriate medications and\nmonitoring thereof, wound care, nutritional services, and safe\nconditions that were not adequately rendered to PNH residents for\nthe period January 1995 through December 1996.  31 U.S.C. § 3729.\n- 12 -\n\n51.  Defendants knowingly did not ascertain the truth or\nfalsity of the claims for services submitted or caused to be\nsubmitted to the Medicaid and Medicare Programs, for payment or\napproval on behalf of PNH residents, all of whom were Medicaid\nrecipients and/or Medicare beneficiaries.  31 U.S.C. § 3729.\n52.  Defendants acted in reckless disregard and/or\ndeliberate ignorance of the care and services ordered and\nactually provided to PNH residents when billing the Medicaid and\nMedicare Programs.  31 U.S.C. § 3729.\n53.  Upon information and belief, the United States alleges\nthat the care rendered to the residents identified in Exhibit A\nwas representative of the care rendered to residents of PNH.  The\nclaims for reimbursement for the care of these residents would\nthus constitute false claims actionable under the False Claims\nAct to the same extent as the claims for the individuals\nidentified in Exhibit A.\n54.  The United States was damaged as a result of the\nconduct described above.\nCOT7NT ITT: UNJUST ENRICHMENT\n55.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein by\nreference as if fully set forth.\n- 13 -\n\n56.  The conduct described in the foregoing paragraphs\ncaused all Defendants to receive, directly or indirectly,\nbenefits from the United States.\n57.  Under the circumstances described in the'.foregoing\nparagraphs, as between the United States and each Defendant in\nthis Count, retention by each Defendant of the benefits conferred\nby the United States would be unjust.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, the United States of America, prays,\nwith regard to Count I of this Complaint, that this Court enter\nan order permanently enjoining Defendants, their agents,\nemployees, subordinates, successors in office, and all those\nacting in concert or participation with them from continuing the\nacts, practices and omissions at PNH set forth in paragraphs\n24 through 36 above, and to require Defendants to take such\naction as will provide legal and constitutional conditions of\ncare to persons who reside at PNH.  The United States further\nprays that this Court grant such other and further equitable\nrelief as it may deem just and proper.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, the United States of America, demands\nand prays, with regard to Count II of this Complaint, that\njudgment be entered in its favor and against the Defendants,\n- 14 -\n\njointly and severally, as follows:\na.  an amount equal to the number of false or fraudulent\nclaims that will be proven at trial, multiplied as provided\nfor in 31 U.S. C. § 3729 (a), and imposition of '-$10, 000.00 per\nclaim;\nb.  three times that total amount of damages sustained by\nthe United States because of the acts complained of;\nc.  costs of this action;\nd.  such other and further relief as the Court shall deem\nproper.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, the United States of America, demands\nand prays, with regard to Count III of this Complaint, that\njudgment be entered in its favor and against the Defendants,\njointly and severally, as follows:\na.  an amount equal to the gain to the Defendants as a\nresult of the activities complained of;\nb.  interest according to law;\nc.  costs of this action; and\nd.  such other and further relief as this Court may deem\nproper.\n- 15 -\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nJ*NET RENO\nAttorney General of the\nUnited States\nMICHAEL R.

Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney General  -  Wuhington, D.C 20035\nDecember 19, 1996\nThe Honorable Edward G. Rendell\nMayor of the City of Philadelphia\nOffice of the Mayor\n215 City Hall\nPhiladelphia, PA  19107\nRe:  Investigation of the Philadelphia Nursing Home\nDear Mayor Rendell:\nOn July 28, 1995, we notified you, pursuant to the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997, of our intent to investigate conditions at the\nPhiladelphia Nursing Home (\"PNH\") in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nWe conducted our investigation by reviewing facility records,\nincluding residents' medical charts and other documents relating\nto the care and treatment of PNH residents, interviewing\nadministrators, staff, and residents, and conducting on-site\ntours of the facility with three expert consultants:  Blaine S.\nGreenwald, M.D., a geriatric psychiatrist, Ronald D. Adelman,\nM.D., a geriatric physician, and Geraldine Mendelson, R.N.,\nM.Ed., M.A., C.N.A.A., a geriatric nurse.  Following these tours,\nwe obtained and analyzed survey reports from independent\nconsultants retained by the City to evaluate conditions at PNH.\nConsistent with CRIPA's statutory requirements, we are now\nwriting to inform you of our findings.\nBased on our comprehensive investigative review, we have\nconcluded that there are numerous conditions and practices at PNH\nthat violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of\nPNH residents.  This conclusion should come as little surprise\ngiven that throughout our visit, a number of PNH administrators\nand professional and direct care staff readily admitted that many\nservice areas were insufficient and needed remedial attention.\nOur independent conclusions and findings were also supported by\nthe conclusions and findings contained in the City's own\ndocuments summarizing its many internally generated on-site\nreviews of the facility.  We have set forth below the facts\nsupporting our findings of unlawful and unconstitutional\nconditions at PNH.\nBefore addressing the substantive violations, we would like\nto express our appreciation to the PNH administrators and staff\nand the City of Philadelphia representatives who extended their\n\n- 2 -\ncooperation and courtesy while we visited the facility.  We would\nespecially like to recognize Mollie Hess, Executive Director of\nPNH, and Jim Casey of PNH for their professionalism, hard work\nand diligent efforts in supplying us with the information we\nneeded to conduct a thorough and accurate investigation of PNH.\nIndeed, both repeatedly stressed their sincere desire to improve\nconditions and practices at the facility.  We hope to be able to\ncontinue to work with the City and PNH officials in such an\natmosphere of cooperation and good faith.\nI.  PNH IS FAILING TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ITS RESIDENTS AND TO\nPROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THEIR BASIC CARE NEEDS\nIndividuals residing in a state or municipally operated\ninstitution have a fundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process\nright to basic care and reasonably safe conditions.\nYounabera v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  Federal statutes\ngoverning the operation of nursing homes create similar rights.\nSee, e.g.. Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs\n(Medicaid), 42 U.S.C. § 1396r, Health Insurance for Aged and\nDisabled (Medicare), 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3, and their implementing\nregulations, 42 C.F.R. § 483, Subpart B.  PNH fails to provide\nadequately for the most basic care needs of many of its residents\nand fails to ensure resident safety, thereby violating the legal\nrights of its residents.\nA.  PNH Fails To Ensure Resident Safety\nPNH violates residents' rights by failing to provide a safe\nenvironment.  Protection from harm is a fundamental\nconstitutional right and a basic requirement of facilities, such\nas PNH, receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds.  Younaberg v.\nRomeo. 457 U.S. 307 (1982); 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.13, 483.15\n(residents have the right to be free from verbal, sexual,\nphysical, and mental abuse, and corporal punishment; the facility\nmust also provide a \"safe\" environment).\nThe facility's incident reports and special abuse\ninvestigations reveal a high level of injuries and dangerous\nsituations that place residents at risk of harm.  Many of these\nincidents are preventable and reflect systemic deficiencies at\nPNH including lack of adequate staffing, failure to supervise\nresidents, and inadequate assessment and treatment of mental\nillness, cognitive impairments, and behavior problems.  A number\nof the incidents result from aggressive PNH residents attacking\nother residents.  For example, in the space of a few weeks during\nthe summer months just prior to our tour, the following incidents\noccurred at PNH:  J.S \"assaulted\" J.C. by punching her in her\nleft eye; a day earlier, J.S. punched her in the right jaw; F.F.\npunched W.W. in the head and chest and hit D.D. giving her a\nbruised eye; T.W. \"attacked\" J.F. with a glass vase, striking him\non the head causing an occipital laceration; B.W. and P.S. were\n\n- 3 -\nhitting each other on the arms and shoulders; N.S. entered B.M.'s\nroom and punched her in the face; C.Q. punched E.M. in the chest;\nJ.R. hit A.S. three times in the head causing a lump on A.S.'s\nhead; J.R. threw a cup of coffee and his walker at E.A.; and V.M.\nhit N.S. in the chest.  During the same few weeks, a PNH aide\nallegedly \"started slapping Mr. E. [a resident] in the face.\"\nv\nOther injuries and harmful situations have resulted from\nunsupervised residents who elope or abuse alcohol while in the\nfacility.  These are merely representative examples of other\nsimilar preventable incidents that are routinely occurring\nthroughout the facility that demonstrate a systemic failure to\nprotect residents from harm.\nB.  PNH Often Fails To Provide Basic Care To Residents\nPNH also often fails to meet the most basic care needs of\nits residents.  While we found a relatively clean facility at the\ntime of our tour, we also uncovered a number of disturbing\nexamples where residents' basic care needs were not met.  For\nexample, we discovered foul odors on residents and in resident\nrooms, and unkempt and dirty residents wearing unsanitary clothes\nthat were malodorous and covered with food or fluid.  Upon\nsmelling a \"severe urine odor\" coming from one resident's room,\nour nurse consultant discovered a resident in a bed that was\nsoaking wet in which he had apparently been left for some time.\nDr. Greenwald reports that the \"stench was hardly bearable\" in\nanother resident's room.  Dr. Greenwald concludes that these\n\"neglectful situations could be interpreted as a kind of passive\nabuse ... [which] trespassed beyond the typical range of hygienic\nconditions that one encounters in nursing homes.\"  During our\ntour, several PNH care aides freely admitted dismay about the\nlack of staff concern and attention paid to the residents' basic\ncare needs.\nThe City has documented similar problems in its on-site\nreviews of conditions at PNH.  For instance, City surveyors in\nMarch 1995 found \"a lack of overall cleanliness [at PNH] .  Odors\nwere prevalent throughout the building, residents' rooms were\nlinkempt, wheelchairs and geri chairs were dirty and in ill\nrepair.\"  Perhaps most troubling was the City surveyors'\nconclusion that PNH failed to remedy these basic care problems\neven after having been alerted to them on prior occasions.\nA number of different PNH residents spoke to us freely and\nat length about the many substandard conditions and practices at\nPNH.  The independent observations and conclusions of the\nresidents reinforced one another as our tour progressed.  Some\nresidents complained that units are short-staffed, especially on\nthe weekends and evenings, and that staff members generally do\nnot assist the residents.  Virtually all residents we spoke to\ncomplained that PNH nurses failed to respond in a timely fashion\nto their calls for assistance.  One resident felt that conditions\n\n- 4 -  . -\nhad improved somewhat since the recent arrival of the newer\nhealth care staff, but he felt that the newer staff members were\ninexperienced and not properly trained to care for the population\nat PNH.  Most troubling, this resident expressed concern about\nthe staff's slow response to his emergency needs.  He related\nthat when he has experienced shortness of breath, ^experienced a\nrapid heartbeat, or has run out of his supply of oxygen, it has\ntaken PNH staff twenty minutes to come to help him.  This\nconclusion is consistent with the City's independent on-site\nreview findings in October 1995 that a number of PNH staff do not\ntend to the residents' needs while on duty, including residents\nwho have medical orders to receive one-to-one supervision.\nIn addition, more than' one resident indicated that the PNH\nstaff members are generally insensitive towards the residents,\nthat the PNH aides talk to the residents with a disrespectful,\noften verbally abusive tone, and that their personal belongings\nare stolen.  The PNH administration, having taken the positive\nstep of regularly attending resident council meetings,\nacknowledged to us that many of the residents' concerns are\nlegitimate.\nII.  PNH FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ACTIVITIES TO RESIDENTS AND\nUSES UNREASONABLE RESTRAINTS\nPNH is failing to engage its residents in adequate,\nappropriate and meaningful activities in violation of their\nfederal statutory rights.  See, e.g.. 42 C.F.R. § 483.15\n(\"facility must provide for an ongoing program of activities\ndesigned to meet ... the interests and the physical, mental, and\npsychosocial well-being of each resident\").\nEven the City's on-site review has uncovered that often no\nactivities take place at PNH and that \" [t]here-are not enough\nactivities scheduled for the diversity of this population.\"  The\nCity's November 1995 on-site review discovered PNH activities\nstaff reading the newspaper, listening to the radio or watching\ntelevision instead of engaging the residents in activities.  PNH\nresidents have expressed similar concerns.\nOne consequence of the lack of meaningful activity may be\nresident abuse of alcohol resulting from boredom and lack of\nstaff supervision and involvement with residents.  This problem\nappears to be widespread at PNH.  For example, the City's\nOctober 1995 on-site review reveals that one verbally abusive and\nphysically aggressive resident had a persistent problem with\n\"smelling of alcohol,\" and being found sleeping in the lounge\nwith bottles of alcohol present.  An August 11, 1995 PNH special\nabuse notification letter indicates that another resident left\nthe facility in his wheelchair via the front gate while he was\nintoxicated.  During our tour, one PNH mental health consultant\n\n- 5 -\nacknowledged that there is a great need for programming and\ntreatment for residents with alcoholism at PNH.\nIn addition, PNH frequently uses restraints as a substitute\nfor keeping the residents engaged.  This practice violates the\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of residents.\nYounabero v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982); 42 C.F.R/§ 483.13\n(\"resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical\nrestraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience, and\nnot required to treat the resident's medical symptoms\").\nMoreover, PNH restraint practices do not comport with\naccepted professional standards.  During our tour, we discovered\nthat many residents were in restraints or in bed with the bed\nrails up, restricting their ability to leave the bed, without\nproper physicians' orders.  Indeed, PNH is failing to provide its\nresidents with adequate evaluations prior to the use of or\ninitiation of an order for restraints.  The City's own on-site\nreviews of PNH confirm our findings.!/  We also found that some\nresidents were not released from their restraints every two hours\nas is generally accepted.  These inappropriate restraint\npractices violate PNH residents' rights.\nIII.  PNH IS FAILING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE FOR ITS\nRESIDENTS\nIn addition to basic care and safety, all residents of state\nor municipally operated institutional facilities have a\nfundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to adequate\nhealth care.  Younabera v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  See also\n42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b) (4) (A) , 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(A)\n(facility must provide for medical, nursing and related services\nto \"attain or maintain the highest practicable.physical, mental,\nand psychosocial well-being of each resident,\" and provide\nadequate treatment and services required by mentally ill and\nmentally retarded residents), and their implementing regulations,\n42 C.F.R. § 483, Subpart B.  However, PNH fails to provide its\nresidents with medical, nursing and psychiatric care and services\nthat comport with generally accepted practices.\nt/  For example, the November 1995 on-site review indicates \"no\norders when restraint use indicated in record ... orders for side\nrails many times not seen ... no assessment of restraint use.\"\nSimilarly, the October on-site review reveals:  \"[s]ide rails up\non beds throughout facility, but no orders for them\"; \"[e]vening\nshift documents that side rails are up, but no physician's order\nis seen\"; \"[n]ursing documented at 10 p.m. that side rails were\nup. but no order was written for them.\"  The September on-site\nreview again reveals that PNH often places residents in\nrestraints without proper orders:  \"use of 'leg restraint' - no\norder seen for such\"; \"[r]esident needs order for side rails.\"\n\n- 6 -\nA.  Psychiatric Practices And Mental Health Services Are\nInadequate And Do Not Meet The Needs Of The Residents\nPNH is not providing its mentally ill residents with\nadequate psychiatric and mental health services in accordance\nwith generally accepted standards.  Psychiatric practices at PNH\nare typically characterized by superficial evaluations,\ninadequate follow-ups, a lack of non-drug treatment approaches, a\nlack of cogent treatment planning, a lack of multidisciplinary\ninput into psychiatric treatment decisionmaking, and a lack of\npsychiatric inservices.\nThe City, through its on-site review documents and the\nstatements of its employees, readily admits deficiencies in\nmental health services at PNH.  For example, the City's own\nNovember 1995 on-site review reveals \"zero percent\" compliance\nwith professional standards in its review of antipsychotic\ntherapy at PNH.  During our tour, both PNH's mental health\nconsultants and nurses freely admitted deficiencies in\npsychiatric care and mental health services at PNH.\n1.  Mental Health Assessments, Diagnoses And Treatments Are\nInappropriate\nPNH is generally failing to appropriately assess, diagnose\nand treat its residents who need mental health services.  For\nexample, although many residents have cognitive impairments and\ndementia, PNH does not perform proper cognitive examinations and\ndoes not develop adequate and appropriate dementia work-ups.\nThese failures can lead to needless resident deterioration and to\nthe development of irreversible conditions in residents that\nmight have been reversible.  In addition, PNH charts often lack\nconsistent or appropriate diagnoses.  An adequate diagnosis is\nessential to develop appropriate treatment.  As Dr. Greenwald\nnotes, an inadequate diagnosis \"can lead to improper treatment\nthat could harm the resident, either by subjecting him or her to\nneedless medication and its attendant side effects, and/or by\nfailing to treat the underlying mental illness, thereby exposing\nthe resident to negative target behaviors that are not properly\ncontrolled.\"\nAs a result of the flawed assessment process and inadequate\ndiagnostic formulation, treatments are often not appropriate.\nFor example, several PNH residents have been inappropriately\nplaced on multiple psychotropic drugs without clearly documented\nbenefit.  Such polypharmacy treatment places these residents at\nunnecessary risk of harm of medication side effects and\nimproperly medicates them without the benefit of productively\ntreating their mental illness.  In this regard,  Dr. Greenwald\nconcludes that PNH has engaged in \"cavalier\" polypharmacy\npractice which is \"dangerous,\" and \"likely-to-be harmful.\"\n\n- 7 -\nPNH also fails to provide its residents with adequate and\nnecessary non-drug mental health services.  Resident care plans\ngenerally fail to substantively address mental health treatment.\nA number of PNH residents who could benefit from psychosocial\ntreatment do not receive these services.  Because of this,\nDr. Greenwald concludes that the residents \"may remain mired in a\nstate of institutionalized dysfunctionality, when their potential\nto improve may be significant.\"\nMoreover, there is a marked discrepancy between published\nPNH policies and the reality of practice at PNH.  Contrary to\nwhat is written in the Administrative Policies and Procedures\nguidelines, care plans do not seriously \"build on resident's\nstrengths\" or \"have treatment objectives with measurable\noutcomes\" that are actually measured, and the facility does not\nensure that residents \"who use antipsychotic drugs receive\ngradual dose reductions, drug holidays or behavioral\nprogramming.\"\n2.  Psychiatric Drug Side Effects Monitoring Is Inadequate\nMedication side effects monitoring at PNH is inadequate and\nfails to meet generally accepted standards.  Residents are often\nneedlessly subjected to the risks of side effects of the treating\nmedication, thus further exacerbating their already fragile\ncondition.  Because of the increased sensitivity to medications\namong the elderly, it is important that PNH actively monitor side\neffects.  However, PNH does not provide adequate side effects\nmonitoring.  For example, PNH's abnormal involuntary movement\nmonitoring is inconsistent at best and typically inaccurate.\nThis failure is especially troubling given that some abnormal\ninvoluntary movement side effects associated with antipsychotics\nmay be irreversible for some of the residents.\nPNH chart notes rarely reflect that specific drug side\neffects are considered in the treatment equation.  The consult\npsychiatrist has largely abdicated side effect monitoring for\nantipsychotics to a form that nurses are supposed to fill out,\nbut rarely if ever do.  Several PNH nursing staff even admitted\nto us that they do not know what side effects to look for.  We\nfound that side effects data collection is inadequate in that the\nPNH forms are haphazardly filled out and, when they are filled\nout, are.often inaccurate.  The City's on-site review findings\nconsistently confirm these deficiencies in side effects\nmonitoring.\nAs a result of these deficiencies, PNH often chronically\nadministers psychotropic medications that have not proven to be\neffective.  PNH therefore unnecessarily subjects its residents to\nmedication side effects.  Dr. Greenwald concludes that the\nconsequence of this practice is that \"potentially successful\npsychiatric treatment and rehabilitation is undermined, and in\n\n-  8 r\nselected residents, longer-than-necessary institutionalization\nmaintained and potential re-entry to mainstream society derailed.\nAll of these deficiencies contribute to either harming the\nresidents or placing them at increased risk of harm.\"\n3.  Psychiatric Progress Notes, Forms And Documentation Are\nInadequate\nPsychiatric chart documentation at PNH is inadequate and\nconveys little meaningful information.  Our experts found that\nprogress notes, behavior/side effect monitoring forms, and\nproblem lists do not accurately summarize current clinical\ncircumstances.  The PNH notes are usually superficial, employ\ngeneralities, are not tied to residents' symptoms or diagnoses,\nand do not identify goals of treatment.  Moreover, even when\nclinical findings are documented, they often do not yield\nappropriate and needed treatments.\n4.  Mental Health Resources And Expertise Are Insufficient\nPNH does not provide a sufficient number of psychiatry\nconsult hours to meet the needs of the residents.  The current\nconsult psychiatrist admitted that he did not see every resident\nwith mental illness at PNH at least once a year as required by\nprofessional standards.  In fact, he admitted that he only sees\nresidents on a referral basis rather than proactively instituting\na case-identification protocol and appropriate follow-up system.\nAs a result, the psychiatrist admitted that some residents have\nnot been seen who should have been seen simply because no\nreferral had been made.  Indeed, Dr. Greenwald found residents\nwith mental illness who have exhibited violent or threatening\nbehaviors who have not had any psychiatric consultations.  Even\nthe new PNH mental health team acknowledged that more psychiatric\ntime was necessary at PNH given the large number of residents\nwith mental health concerns.\nWe uncovered several instances where a psychiatric consult\nwas ordered but the psychiatrist did not actually see the\nresident for weeks.  This practice is improper and compromises\nattentive resident care because the condition prompting the\npsychiatric consult may become dramatically exacerbated in the\nintervening weeks.  Dr. Greenwald found that it produces the\nlikelihood of \"untoward and potentially dangerous\" incidents that\ncould occur, placing the resident or others at risk of harm.\nOverall, Dr. Greenwald concludes that \"this kind of loose\noversight compromises patient care and is heavily dependent upon\ngood nursing staff-psychiatrist communication.  However, at PNH,\nnursing staff-psychiatrist communication is erratic and\nsuperficial.\"  There is little if any multidisciplinary\ninvolvement in psychiatric treatment decisionmaking at PNH.  We\nfound little evidence that the treating psychiatrist is aware of,\n\nor has explored, considered and incorporated relevant and\nimportant nursing information.  The City's own on-site reviews\ndocument that the consult psychiatrist fails to consider\nimportant behavioral information contained in the nursing notes.\nIn addition, there is a general need for continuing\neducation among the PNH staff at large with respect to mental\nhealth and psychiatric concerns among its residents.  There is a\nconspicuous lack of continuing education and inservices regarding\nmental health issues at PNH.\nB.  Medical Care And Services At PNH Are Inadequate To Meet\nThe Residents' Needs\nPNH also fails to provide its residents with adequate and\nappropriate health care in a number of other areas.\n1.  Neurological Care Is Inadequate\nNeurological care and services at PNH are inadequate.  PNH\nprimary care physicians, rather than neurologists, provide most\nof the neurological care at the facility.  As a result, many\nresidents with neurological problems, including those with\ncomplex and difficult conditions, do not receive the needed\nspecialty services of a neurologist.  For example, the PNH\nphysicians did not refer to a neurologist a number of residents\nwho had drug levels that were chronically difficult to control.\nIn addition, PNH physicians often fail to adequately address\nresidents' anti-seizure medication where they have\nsub-therapeutic or above therapeutic levels.  For instance, for\none resident whose Dilantin level fluctuated from high to low to\nhigh again, the PNH physician failed to adjust the medication\ndose, failed to discuss an approach to deal with this problem,\nand failed to procure expert neurological consult help.  The same\ninadequate documentation and approach was present in the care of\nanother resident who exhibited a high Dilantin level and a\nsub-therapeutic Tegretol level.  As Dr. Adelman concludes for yet\nanother resident, \"there is a danger that this resident may be\nneedlessly exposed to medication that is not providing him with\nany benefit.\"  The City's own on-site reviews reveal a number of\nsimilar concerns surrounding neurological care at PNH, including\nconsults not being performed in a timely manner and inadequate\ndocumentation of laboratory tests.\nPNH also does not have a protocol for proper treatment of\nemergency seizure situations, known as \"status epilepticus.\"\nContrary to generally accepted practice, PNH uses intramuscular\ninjection to.treat such emergency situations rather than\nintravenous treatment.  This practice places PNH residents at\nactive risk of harm.  In light of the number of PNH residents\nwith seizures and other neurological complications, the\n\n- 10 -\nfacility's deficiencies in neurological care compromise the\nhealth of a significant number of residents.\n2.  Interdisciplinary Communication Is Inadequate\nInterdisciplinary communication between physicians and other\nhealth care professionals at PNH is inadequate andK does not\ncomport with generally accepted standards.  The City's\nSeptember 1995 on-site review reveals that \"interdisciplinary\ncommunication is lacking, i.e., no follow-up by other disciplines\nafter findings or recommendations are made.\"  During our tour,\neven the PNH Medical Director admitted to us that the functioning\nof the interdisciplinary team needed improvement.\nPoor communication between the doctors and the nurses at PNH\nmay have contributed to the death of at least one PNH resident.\nDr. Adelman made this conclusion after reviewing the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of a resident who had been\nreceiving Coumadin, a blood thinning medication.  Despite the\npresence of blood in the resident's urine, PNH continued to\nprovide the resident with Coumadin, contrary to accepted\nprofessional standards.  As Dr. Adelman concluded, this death\nreveals \"a disturbing lack of understanding on the part of\nnursing about the meaning of [blood in the urine], and therefore,\npoor communication with the [PNH] physician.\"\n3.  Physician Orders Are Inappropriate, Incomplete, Unclear\nThe orders of the PNH physicians are often inappropriate,\nincomplete, or unclear.  For example, the City's October 1995\non-site review reveals that PNH physicians continue to rely\ninappropriately on verbal and telephone verbal orders rather than\nwritten orders for treatment.  The October on-site review also\nfound that physicians' medical diagnoses are often lacking on the\nphysician order sheet.  Moreover, Geri Mendelson, our nursing\nconsultant, concludes that physicians' orders are often not clear\nand that the nurses exacerbate the problem by not taking steps to\nclarify the orders before trying to implement them.  These\ndeficiencies create the danger that orders will not be carried\nout as intended, thus jeopardizing the health and welfare of the\nPNH residents who need appropriate treatment.\n4. - Medical Notes And Documentation Are Inadequate\nAs is true with psychiatric notes and documentation, PNH\ngeneral medical notes and documentation are also incomplete and\nfail to comport with generally accepted standards.  PNH physician\nnotes vary dramatically in quality and generally fail to express\nadequately the needed approach to care for specific issues and to\naddress abnormal medical findings appropriately.\n\n- 11 -\nThe City's November 1995 on-site review revealed \"patterns\nof non-compliance\" with respect to chart notes and documentation.\nIn fact, the on-site review found deficiencies with physician\nprogress notes, physician orders, X-rays, labs and consults.\nSpecifically, the on-site review concluded that physicians'\norders were \"unacceptable\" and that the physicians' progress\nnotes revealed a lack of follow-up to problems identified by\nstaff.  The review also found that PPD [purified protein\nderivative] documentation in the residents' charts is \"not\ncomplete.\"  During our expert tours of PNH, we also discovered\nthat a large number of resident charts contained no obvious\nrecord of PPD test results indicating the presence or absence of\ntuberculosis.  Although many of the charts had a designated sheet\nto track vaccinations and PPD tests, they were unfilled in half\nof the charts reviewed.  In light of the significant increase in\ntuberculosis in nursing homes, these deficiencies pose\nsignificant risk to PNH residents.\nPNH physicians are also failing to complete monthly notes in\nthe residents' charts on a timely basis.  The City's\nNovember 1995 on-site review found \"zero percent\" compliance with\nrespect to the completion of monthly summaries.  It also found no\nevaluation of current care plan goals and no review of\nsignificant resident issues or episodes occurring during the\nmonth.\nIn addition, PNH often fails to obtain timely laboratory\ndata and weights and to provide appropriate follow-up'.  We\nuncovered a number of examples at PNH where there were\nunacceptably long delays in obtaining consult results, initiating\nmedical tests, obtaining the test results, and providing\nappropriate treatment.  As Dr. Adelman concludes, \"[a] better\nmechanism for tracking tests and obtaining test results in a\ntimely manner should be a priority.\"\n5.  Staffing And Resource Concerns\nState surveyors in June 1995 found the ratio of physicians\nto residents at PNH was extraordinarily poor; each PNH physician\nwas responsible for the health care of two hundred or more\nresidents.  Just prior to our tour, however, PNH quickly added\nphysicians to its staff.  The picture presented to us at the time\nof our tour was even more skewed because the resident census had\nbeen\"artificially reduced for months due to a ban on admissions\nand re-admissions that was imposed on PNH after the June 1995\ncertification survey.  At the time of our tour, re-admissions of\ndischarged PNH residents had just resumed, and 'new admissions\nwere about to start again.  Even so, the resident census at the\ntime of our tour was at least 150 residents below where PNH\nprojects it to be in the future.  Many of the residents scheduled\nto be re-admitted were some of the most medically fragile\nindividuals at the nursing home.  As Dr. Adelman suggests, given\n\n- 12 -\nthe artificially reduced census and the presence of new staff\nphysicians, a \"re-evaluation\" of the medical department should be\nconducted when the full resident census is reached.\nC.  Nursing Care And Services At PNH Fail To Meet Generally\nAccepted Practices\nThere are deficiencies in the delivery of nursing care and\nservices at PNH which breach generally accepted standards of\nclinical practice and which seriously jeopardize the residents.\n1.  Nurses Fail To Follow Standard Infection Control\nProcedures\nPNH nurses fail to adhere to universally accepted treatment\nprotocols with respect to infection control procedures and\nmaintaining aseptic conditions at treatment sites.  The PNH\nDirector of Nursing admitted to us that she has concerns about\nthe nursing staff's competency in and knowledge of proper wound\ncare to reduce the possibility of infection.  Our nursing\nconsultant concludes that \"the PNH nurses did not follow\ngenerally accepted procedures to reduce the risk of infection\n-.. and generally did not' follow universally accepted procedures\nrelated to maintaining cleanliness and sterility ... Generally,\nthe PNH nurses ... did not demonstrate the knowledge or skills to\nprovide appropriate nursing services to residents.\"  The City's\nown November 1995 on-site review indicates that \" [t]reatments did\nnot meet standards of practice utilizing aseptic technique.\"  The\nCity's March on-site review again found that PNH staff do not\npractice Universal Precautions for infection control, emphasizing\nthat \"this area is of serious concern.\"  Once again, it is\ntroubling that PNH failed to correct this deficiency months after\nit was clearly cited as a problem.\n2.  Care Of Residents With Diabetes Is Inadequate\nPNH fails to provide adequate and acceptable health care to\nresidents with diabetes.  Specifically, the practice of\nevaluating blood sugars and providing subsequent treatment is not\nacceptable at PNH.  Our nursing consultant concludes that the\npractice of providing care and treatment to PNH residents with\ninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (a serious form of diabetes)\nis \"not acceptable,\" and that these residents are \"at great\nrisk.\"\nWe uncovered many incidents where PNH staff had administered\nincorrect and/or inaccurate doses of insulin, did not properly\nmonitor certain diabetic residents or inform the physician of\ntheir status, and generally did not accurately document insulin\nadministration.  In one case, PNH provided a resident with\ntwenty-two straight days of incorrect insulin doses.  For another\nresident who was suffering with an elevated blood sugar level,\n\n- 13 -\nPNH failed to provide an appropriate follow-up note about the\ncontinuing status of the resident or even a note indicating that\nthe physician had been notified.  Our nursing consultant\nconcludes that the nursing practice in this case was \"not\nacceptable,\" and if left to continue, \"could cause harm or even\ndeath to the resident.\"  The PNH nursing staff also improperly\ntreated another resident with low blood sugar without first\nobtaining a physician's order.  Our nursing consultant concludes\nthat because this was not done, \"the resident could have gone\ninto shock.\"  Dr. Adelman discovered multiple instances where PNH\nstaff failed to follow the generally accepted practice of calling\nthe supervising registered nurse and physician when residents'\ndiabetic levels were too low or too high.  We found a number of\nexamples where neither the nurse nor the physician even addressed\nabnormal blood glucose levels.  It appeared in each case that the\nphysician was never notified or not timely notified.  Consistent\nwith this finding, the City's October 1995 on-site review reveals\nthat even PNH nursing supervisors fail to obtain a physician's\norder before treating diabetic residents.\n3.  Medication Administration Is Inadequate And Nurses Fail\nTo Follow Physicians' Orders\nPNH nurses fail to consistently provide accurate and timely\nmedication administration to PNH residents.  The use and\nreporting of controlled drugs is not acceptable at PNH.  During\nour tour, we uncovered many different medication errors that\ncompromise resident care.  The City's on-site reviews also\nconclude that medication passes are unacceptable at PNH, with\nmedication error administration rates as high as thirty-eight\npercent.  One such review found that medication administration\nrecords and treatment administration records were all virtually\none hundred percent out of compliance with professional\nstandards.  The- City's review concluded:  \"These areas reflect\nrepeated gaps in documentation, not just on one dose omission.\nThis is a serious liability and one that must be addressed.\nimmediately.\"\nPNH nurses are also not meeting generally accepted standards\nbecause they routinely fail to follow physicians' orders which\nplaces the PNH residents in jeopardy.  During our tour, we\ndiscovered that PNH nurses had failed to perform a number of\nphysician-ordered treatments; there was no documentation in the\nresidents' charts as to why the treatments were not done or even\nthat the physician was notified.\n4.  Skin Care Is Inadequate\nPNH fails to perform needed skin assessments on new\nadmittees to determine which residents might be at risk for skin\nbreakdown.  Moreover, PNH residents at risk of developing\npressure ulcers do not receive required assistance from the\n\n- 14 -\nfacility to ensure that their activities of daily living are\nmaintained and that their individual physical and functional\nabilities do not decrease.  Once skin breakdowns occur, PNH does\nnot provide adequate and appropriate treatments.  Nurses do not\ntreat wounds from skin breakdowns with proper aseptic techniques\nand do not follow physicians' orders about turning, and\nre-positioning residents.\n5.  Nutritional Intake Concerns\nPNH's practices in a number of areas are not adequate to\nmeet its residents' nutritional needs.  First, the facility fails\nto monitor residents' nutritional intake adequately during meals\nand fails to provide substitute meals for residents when\nappropriate.  The City has documented these deficiencies\nrepeatedly during its on-site reviews of PNH.  Residents have\nlost significant amounts of weight while under PNH's care, yet\nthe facility fails to weigh residents on a regular basis.  When\nit does weigh residents, the weights are often inaccurate.  Even\nin situations where a significant weight loss is actually\naccurately recorded, doctors, nurses, and dieticians do not\naddress the problem.  During our tour, the PNH dietician\nacknowledged that the facility has no formal mechanism to notify\nappropriate health care professionals that residents are losing\nweight.  The City has found other pervasive deficiencies in this\narea at PNH, including a failure to conduct appropriate\nnutritional assessments and to provide appropriate diets.\nSecond, PNH fails to provide adequate assessments and\ntreatment to residents who have swallowing disorders or who\ncannot eat orally.  For example, during its November on-site\nreview, the City found that the facility's therapist was not\nfollowing accepted standards of practice in performing screenings\nto identify residents with swallowing problems.\"- Other reviews\nhave documented deficiencies in PNH's practices with respect to\nresidents who are unable to eat and must be fed with a tube.  The\ndeficiencies include a failure to conduct adequate assessments of\nthese residents' dietary needs, a failure to provide residents\nwith sufficient calories, protein, vitamins and minerals, and a\nfailure to make a concerted effort to wean residents off of tube\nfeeders.\nFinally, during our tour, we also heard many complaints from\nresidents about the adequacy of food they receive.  The resident\ncouncil meeting minutes are rife with resident complaints about\nfood, drink and meals generally.  During our tour, we further\ndiscovered that PNH is failing to provide its residents with\nconsistently fresh drinking water.  We observed that the\nresidents were left to consume water that had been sitting around\nfor days in a styrofoam cup.\n\n- 15 -  -\n6.  Nurses Do Not Timely Respond To Resident Calls For Help\nA recurring refrain among residents was that PNH nurses and\nstaff did not respond to resident call bells in a timely manner.\nA number of residents stated that it has taken nurses over\nforty-five minutes to respond to resident calls for assistance.\nIn one case, a resident was forced to turn off his'oxygen machine\nto sound a loud alarm just to get the attention of the staff.  He\nsaid he more regularly uses a flash light siren to attract the\nstaff after they fail to respond to his call bell.  We also found\nthat some call bells were not appropriately placed near the more\nimmobile residents so that they could access them.\n7.  Nursing Documentation Is Inadequate\nAs is true in the other disciplines discussed above, nursing\ndocumentation and charting is deficient at PNH.  The City's\nNovember 1995 on-site review reveals \"patterns of non-compliance\"\nwith respect to PNH nursing chart notes and documentation.  In\nfact, the on-site reviews found deficiencies with nursing history\nand assessment, nurses notes, monthly nursing summaries, weights\nand vital signs, medication and treatment cardexes, care plans,\ndietary and skin assessments.  Similar findings, including the\nneed for inservicing nursing staff about appropriate\ndocumentation, appear in earlier on-site City reviews of PNH.\n8.  Nurse Staffing Is Inadequate\nNurse staffing levels are unacceptable at PNH.  The City's\nown on-site review acknowledges that \"[s]taffing continues to be\nan issue.\"  At the time of our tour, there were many nursing\nvacancies and an unacceptably high use of contract nurses.  The\nPNH Director of Nursing admitted to us that current permanent\nnurse staffing is not sufficient and that the facility must rely\ninstead on contract nurses to meet residents' needs.  The figures\ncontained in the City's on-site reviews reveal \"significant\" use\nof contract agency nurses at PNH:  in October 1995, PNH used\nagency nurses for about twenty-six percent of its registered\nnurse positions, and used agency nurses for over seventy-one\npercent of its licensed practical nurse positions.  Not only is\nthe overuse of contract nurses inefficient and costly, but it\nalso compromises resident care.  The PNH Director of Nursing\nadmitted -that the use of agency nurses poses problems with\ncontinuity of care.  The City's on-site review also concurs with\nthis conclusion.\n9.  Nurses Require Additional Education/Inservices\nNurses, indeed staff in a broad range of disciplines at PNH,\nneed better education about how best to care for PNH residents.\nDr. Adelman concluded that PNH nurses had insufficient knowledge\nand experience to meet the residents' needs.  Members of the PNH\n\n- 16 -\ninfection control team also acknowledged that staff education is\nan area that needs improvement at the facility.  Some of the\nother areas in need of additional training that PNH\nadministrators and staff identified include:  basic quality\nnursing care, assessment skills, prevention strategies,\ninterdisciplinary communication, general staff inservicing, and\ndocumentation.\nIn sum, the deficiencies in medical and nursing care at PNH\noutlined above constitute a systemic failure to meet residents'\nhealth care needs, in violation of their constitutional and\nfederal statutory rights.\nIV.  CERTAIN PNH RESIDENTS ARE NOT BEING SERVED IN THE MOST\nINTEGRATED SETTING APPROPRIATE TO THKIR NEEDS\nFinally, some PNH residents' rights are being violated as a\nresult of their continuing confinement at the facility.  Pursuant\nto Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n42 U.S.C. § 12132, \"no qualified individual with a disability\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs,\nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination by any such entity.\"  Applicable ADA regulations\nprovide:  \"A public entity shall administer services, programs,\nand activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the\nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities.\"  28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(d).  In a recent case involving PNH, the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit held that Idell S., a PNH resident,\nhad a right under the ADA to receive the support services she\nneeded in her own home rather than being required to live in a\nnursing home to receive them since Pennsylvania already had a\nprogram to provide in-home attendant care services.  Helen L. v.\nDiDario. 46 F.3d 325 (3d Cir.), cert, denied. _J^ U.S.  , 116 S.\nCt.  64 (1995).\nThere is a group of individuals with physical disabilities\nat PNH, like Idell S. in the Helen L. case, who professionals\nhave evaluated and determined can live outside of the nursing\nhome with appropriate attendant care services.  Also like\nIdell S., the only reason these individuals must continue to live\nat PNH is because of a lack of available attendant care services\nin the Philadelphia area.  As the Federal Court of Appeals for\nthe Third Circuit has already decided, this is not an acceptable\nreason under the ADA to deny individuals the opportunity to be\nserved in a more integrated setting.  In addition, mentally ill\nPNH residents have not been evaluated by professionals to\ndetermine whether they can be served in a more integrated\nsetting.  The facility's failure to assess these individuals to\ndetermine whether continued confinement in a nursing home is\nnecessary or whether there is a more integrated setting\nappropriate to meet their needs is also a violation of the ADA.\n\n- 17 -\nV.  MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES\nIn order to remedy these deficiencies and to protect the\nrights of PNH residents, the following measures, at a minimum,\nneed to be implemented promptly.\n1.  PNH must fully comply with all applicable provisions of the\nMedicare and Medicaid statutes and their implementing regulations\nthat govern conditions of care at PNH.\n2. . PNH must ensure that the staff members are providing\nresidents with appropriate basic care services that meet the\nresidents' needs.\n3.  PNH must provide a safe environment for its residents.\nStaff members must adequately monitor and safeguard the\nresidents, especially those with histories of exhibiting\nbehaviors that cause injury to themselves or others.  Residents\nmust be protected from being victimized by other aggressive\nresidents.\n4.  PNH must provide residents with sufficient, meaningful\nactivities.  For those residents who abuse alcohol, PNH must\nprovide them with appropriate productive activities and\nprogramming to address their alcohol abuse.\n5.

Psychotropic medication must only be used in\naccordance with accepted professional standards and where there\nis an appropriate psychiatric or neuropsychiatric diagnosis.  It\nmust not be used as punishment, in lieu of a training program,\nfor behavior control, or for the convenience of staff.  In order\nto accomplish this, PNH must:\na. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of each PNH resident\nreceiving psychotropic medication or who has documented\nmental illness; provide the resident with an appropriate\ndifferential diagnosis of mental illness;\nb. Develop an overall treatment plan for each resident with\na diagnosis of mental illness that describes clear,\n\n- 18 - -\nobjective and measurable short-term, intermediate and long\nrange goals and objectives for each resident, including time\nframes for the achievement of each;\nc.

Specifically, the\nCity must procure a sufficient number of neurology consult hours\nto meet the needs of the residents, provide adequate seizure\ndocumentation and recordkeeping, and improve diagnostic\n\n- 19 -\ntechniques.  PNH must put in place an emergency protocol for the\ntreatment of status epilepticus and \"inservice\" staff on how to\nimplement it.  PNH must immediately stop the use of intramuscular\nmedication to treat status.\n8.  PNH must ensure that its residents receive adequate nursing\ncare, and that nurses perform their responsibilities in keeping\nwith accepted professional standards of care by adequately\nidentifying health care problems, notifying physicians of health\ncare problems, monitoring and intervening to ameliorate such\nproblems, and keeping appropriate records of residents' health\ncare status.

The City of Philadelphia\nmust ensure that before any resident is transferred to a more\nintegrated setting, the setting is capable of meeting the\nresident's needs and, once the transfer takes place, that the\nresident's needs are met.  Residents who are mentally ill must be\nassessed to determine whether they are being served in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.\nThe remedial measures outlined above are the minimal steps\nneeded to redress the constitutional and statutory deficiencies\nat PNH.  In order to ensure compliance with the remedial\nmeasures, an effective monitoring and reporting scheme is\nessential.\nGiven our positive experience with the City thus far, we\nhope to be able to resolve this matter amicably and\ncooperatively.  As such, we will be contacting your attorneys in\nthe near future to arrange a meeting to discuss in greater detail\nthe measures needed to fully remedy the deficiencies outlined\nabove.  We look forward to working with you to resolve this\nmatter in a reasonable and practical manner.\n\n- 21 -\nIf you have any questions, please contact Richard Farano at\n202-307-3116, or David R.
