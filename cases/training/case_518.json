The Chester Care Center, Bishop Nursing Home, and Manchester Nursing and Convalescent Center were long-term care facilities in Delaware County, Pennsylvania certified to participate in the Medicare and Medical Assistance programs.  Bishop Nursing Home, Inc. and Commonwealth Real Estate Investors were the owners and licensees of the facilities.  The complaint alleged that the defendants schemed to collect payments from the federal government for services associated with the care of elderly residents when the care provided was inadequate.  It alleged violations of the False Claims Act and claimed that the defendants were unjustly enriched by funds received from the federal government.  The facilities failed to provide adequate nutrition and care to their residents.  The complaint noted instances of improper wound and diabetes care.  </p><p>The district court (Judge Louis H. Pollack) approved a consent order on February 4, 1998.  The defendants agreed to pay $500,000 in settlement of the False Claims Act violation.  The defendants agreed to the appointment of a monitor for all three facilities for at least two years, to implement treatment protocols for residents with diabetes, to provide individualized treatment plans, and to train staff in all areas covered by the order.  </p><p>The PACER docket indicates that there were contempt proceedings in 2000 and 2001.  The action was dismissed on May 7, 2002.  </p><p></p>",

A Consent Order was filed simultaneously with the \nFederal District Court in which the owner of the facilities \nagreed to pay the federal government $500,000 and to implement a \ncomprehensive compliance program to settle claims resulting from \nan investigation into the quality of care provided to residents \nfrom June 1995 to the present. \nIn its Complaint against Chester Care Center, Bishop \nNursing .Home, and Manchester House Nursing C  Convalescent Center \nand their corporate owners, the government charged that the \ndefendants did not render adequate care 'to their residents and \nthe Complaint specifically identifies 5 residents for whom the \ngovernment was paying who were not adequately cared for by the \ndefendants. \nSpecif.ically, the care rendered to 3 residents of \nChester Care Center with diabetes was inadequate in terms of \nmonitoring and responding to complications associated with \ndiabetes, and the provision of nutrition and wound care. \nAnother individual, a resident of Chester Care Center, \nwas scalded to death when a nurses'  aide placed the resident, who \nwas unable to speak, ihto 138 degree Fahrenheit water during a \nbath.  The government's  Complaint alleges that the defendants \nknew that there were problems with the water temperature and did \nnot adequately address that issue. The nurses\" aide has been \ncriminally charged by the state Attorney General's  Office. \n\nThe final victim, a resident of Bishop Nursing Home, \nwas allegedly improperly cared for in terms of his nutrition and \nwound care while the facility billed the Medicaid program for his \ncare.  The government alleged that the facility did not respond \nto this resident's weight loss in a timely fashion and as a \nresult he developed pressure sores (decubitus ulcers) which were \nnot properly treated. \nU.S. Attorney Stiles stated that this False Claims Act \ncase was the second of its kind in the country pertaining to \nquality of care in the nursing home environment and should once \nagain serve notice to the nursing home industry that a failure to \nprovide adequate care to some of the most frail and vulnerable \n.members of society will not be tolerated. \"Quality of care for \nthose residing in nursing homes must be protected by all means \npossible,'\" Stiles noted. \nIn addition to the payment, the terms of the Consent \nOrder apply to approximately 700 residents and require: \n-State-of-the-art treatment protocols for residents \nwith diabetes; \n-Retention of a temporary manager for ~hesterC are \nCent.er to manage the facility and ensure compliance \nwith federal law and regulations; \n-A full-time federal monitor for all three facilities \nfor at least two years; \n-.Provision of wound care in accordance with the Agency \nfor Health Care Policy and Research .(AHCPR) \nguidelines and enhanced nutrition protocols; \n-~evelopmento f a' corporate compliance program that \nensures appropriate responses to, among other items, \nweight loss, wound care and diabetic care; \n-Training of staff on all issues contained in the \nConsent Order. \nThe development of the protocols for this case was done \nwith invaluable assistance from the following individuals: \nStanley Schwartz, M.D. \nBruce Kinosian, M.D. , \nIlene Warner, R.N., C, CWCN, \nBarbara J. Maschak-Carey, R.N.,  M.S.N., \nSue Bradley, R.N., C \n\nThis case also included support from representatives of the \nPennsylvania Department of Health and Department of Public \nWelfare. \nThe case was handled by Assistant United States Attorney \nDavid R. Hoffman. ",

Stiles,  United  States Attorney  for  the \nEastern  District of  Pennsylvania,  Michael  Little,  Regional \nInspector  General  for  Investigations,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman  Services  and  Judith  Berek,  Acting Regional  Administrator \nfor  the  Philadelphia  Regional  Office,  Health  Care  Financing \nAdministration  (HCFA),  today  announced  the  filing  of  a  civil \nFalse  Claims  Act  Complaint  against  three  nursing  homes  located  in \nDelaware  County  for  the  provision  of  inadequate  care  to  their \nresidents.  A Consent  Order  was  filed  simultaneously with  the \nFederal  District Court  in  which  the  owner  of  the  facilities \nagreed  to  pay  the  federal  government  $500,000  and  to  implement  a \ncomprehensive  compliance  program  to  settle claims  resulting  from \nan  investigation into  the  quality of  care  provided to  residents \nfrom  June  1995  to  the present. \nIn  its Complaint  against  Chester  Care  Center,  Bishop \nNursing-Home,  and Manchester  House  Nursing  & Convalescent  Center \nand  their corporate  owners,  the  government  charged  that  the \ndefendants  did not  render  adequate  care -to  their  residents  and \nthe  Complaint  specifically  identifies  5  residents  for  whom  the \ngovernment  was  paying who  were  not  adequately  cared  for  by  the \ndefendants. \nSpecifically,  the  care  rendered  to  3  residents  of \nChester  Care  Center  with  diabetes  was  inadequate  in terms  of \nmonitoring  and responding  to  complications  associated with \ndiabetes,  and  the  provision of  nutrition and wound  care. \nAnother  individual,  a  resident  of  Chester Care  Center, \nwas  scalded  to death  when  a  nurses'  aide  placed  the  resident,  who \nwas  unable  to  speak,  ihto  138  degree  Fahrenheit  water  during  a \nbath.  The  government's  Complaint  alleges  that  the defendants \nknew  that  there were  problems  with  the water  temperature  and  did \nnot  adequately  address  that  issue.- The  nurses'  aide  has  been \ncriminally  charged  by  the  state Attorney  General's  Office. \n\nThe  final  victim,  a  resident of  Bishop  Nursing  Home, \nwas  allegedly  improperly cared  for  in terms  of  his  nutrition and \nwound  care  while  the  facility billed the Medicaid  program  for  his \ncare.  The  government  alleged  that  the  facility did not  respond \nto  this  resident's  weight  loss  in a  timely  fashion  and  as  a \nresult  he  developed  pressure  sores  (decubitus  ulcers)  which  were \nnot  properly  treated. \nU.S.  Attorney Stiles  stated that  this  False  Claims  Act \ncase  was  the  second  of  its  kind  in  the  country pertaining to \nquality of  care  in  the nursing  home  environment  and  should  once \nagain  serve  notice  to  the  nursing home  industry  that a  failure  to \nprovide  adequate  care  to  some  of  the  most  frail  and  vulnerable \n·members  of  society will not  be  tolerated.  \"Quality of  care  for \nthose  residing  in  nursing  homes  must  be  protected by  all means \npossible,'/I  Stiles  noted. \nIn  addition  to  the  payment,  the  terms  of  the  Consent \nOrder  apply  to  approximately  700  residents  and  require: \n-State-of-the-art  treatment protocols  for  residents \nwith diabetes; \n-Retention of a  temporary  manager  for  Chester  Care \nCent.er  to  manage  the  facility  and  ensure  compliance \nwith  federal  law  and  regulations; \n-A  full-time  federal  monitor  for  all  three  facilities \nfor  at  least two  years; \n-Provision of wound  care  in accordance  with  the  Agency \nfor  Health Care  Policy and Research .(AHCPR) \nguidelines  and  enhanced  nutrition protocols; \n-Development  of  a' corporate  compliance  program  that \nensures  appropriate  responses  to,  among  other  items, \nweight  loss,  wound  care  and diabetic  care; \n-Training  of staff on  all  issues  contained in  the \nConsent  Order. \nThe  development  of  the  protocols  for  this  case  was  done \nwith  invaluable  assistance  from  the  following  individuals: \nStanley Schwartz,  M.D., \nBruce  Kinosian,  M.D., \nIlene Warner,  R.N.,C,  CWCN, \nBarbara  J.  Maschak-Carey,  R.N.,  M.S.N., \nSue  Bradley,  R.N.,C \n2 \n\nThis  case  also  included  support  from  representatives  of  theJ \nPennsylvania  Department  of  Health  and  Department  of  Public \nII \nWelfare. \nThe  case  was  handled  by Assistant United  states Attorney \nDavid  R.

A nursing  facility  is  defined  in  the Act as  \"an \ninstitution •.. which--\n(1)  is  primarily engaged  in providing  to  residents--\n(A)  skilled nursing  care  and  related  services  for \nresidents  who  require  medical  or  nursing \ncare, \n(B)  rehabilitation services  for  the \nrehabilitation of  injured,  disabled,  or  sick \npersons,  or \n(C)  on  a  regular  basis,  health-related care  and \nservices  to  individuals  who  because  of  their \nmental  or physical  condition  require  care  and \nservices  (above  the  level  of  room  and  board) \nwhich  can  be  made  available  to  them  only \nthrough  institutional  facilities,  and  is  not \nprimarily for  the  care  and  treatment  of \nmental  diseases;  ..... \n42  U.S.C.A.  §  1396r(a). \nThe  Act  mandates  that nursing  facilities  comply  with  federal \nrequirements  relating to  the provision of  42  U.S.C.A. \n~ervices. \n§  1396r(b).  Specifically,  in  terms  of  the  quality of  life  for \nresidents of nursing  facilities,  the Act  states  that:  \"A  nursing \nfacility must  care  for  its residents  in such  a  manner  and  in such \nan  environment  as  will  promote maintenance  or  enhancement  of  the \nquality of  life of each  resident.\"  42  U.S.C.A.  §  1396r(b) (1)  (A). \nAdditionally,  the Act  mandates  that  a  nursing  facility \n\"provide services and activities  to  attain or maintain  the \nhighest practicable physical,  mental  and psychosocial  well-being \nof each  resident  in accordance  with  a  written plan of  care which-\n\n(A)  describes  the  medical,  nursing,  and  psychosocial \nneeds  of  the  resident  and  how  such  needs  will  be \nmet; ... \" \n42  U.S.C.A.  §  1396r{b) (2)  (A). \nA duty  is  placed on  the  nursing  facility  to  fulfill  the \nresidents'  care  plans  by providing,  or  arranging  for  the \nprovision of,  inter alia,  nursing and  related services  and \nmedically-related social  services  that attain or maintain  the \nhighest  practicable physical,  mental,  and psychosocial  well-being \nof  each  resident,  pharmaceutical  services  and  dietary servi.ces \nthat  assure  that  the meals  meet  the  daily nutritional  and  special \ndietary needs  of  each  resident.  42  U.S.C.A.  §  1396r(4) (A)  (i-iv) . \nThe  Social  Security Act  mandates  that  skilled nursing \nfacilities  that participate  in  the Medicare  Program  and  nursing \nfacilities  that participate  in the Medical  Assistance  Program, \nalso  known  as Medicaid,  meet  certain specific requirements  in \norder  to  qualify  for  such  participation.  These  requirements  are \nset  forth  at  42  C.F.R.  §  483.1  et seq.  and  \"serve  as  the  basis \nfor  survey activities  for  the purpose  of determining whether  a \nfacility meets the  requirements  for  participation in Medicare  and \nMedicaid .... 42C .. F.R.  §  493.1. \nFederal  regulations,  when  addressing  quality of  care \nconcerns,  mandate  that  \"[e]ach resident must  receive  and  the \nfacility must  provide  the  necessary care  and  services  to  attain \nor maintain  the  highest  practicable physical,  mental,  and \n3 \n\npsychosocial  well-being,  in accordance  with  the  comprehensive \nassessment  and  plan of  ca~e.\"  42  C.F.R.  §  483.25.  The \nregulations  specifically address  the  area  of  nutrition: \n(i)  Nutrition.  Based  on  a  resident's  comprehensive \nassessment,  the  facility must  ensure  that  a  resident--\n(1)  Maintains  acceptable parameters  of  nutritional \nstatus,  such  as  body  weight  and  protein  levels,  unless  the \nresident's  clinical  condition demonstrates  that  this  is not \npossible;  and \n(2)  Receives  a  therapeutic  diet  when  there  is  a \nnutritional  problem.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.2S(i). \nAdditionally,  the  Federal  regulations  specifically address  those \nindividuals  who  are  tube-fed: \n(g)  Naso-gastric  tubas.  Based  on  the  comprehensive \nassessment  of  a  resident,  the  facility must  ensure  that--\n(1)  A resident  who  has  been  able  to  eat  enough \nalone  or with  assistance  is not  fed by  naso-gastric  tube \nunless  the  resident's  clinical condition demonstrates  that \nuse  of  a  naso-gastric  tube  was  unavoidable;  and \n(2)  A resident who  is  fed by  a  naso-gastric  or \ngastrostomy tube  receives  the  appropriate  treatment  and \nservices  to prevent  aspiration pneumonia,  diarrhea, \nvomiting,  dehydration,  metabolic  abnormalities,  and  nasal-\n4 \n\npharyngeal  ulcers  and  to  restore,  if possible,  normal  eating \nskills.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.25(g). \nThe  federal  regulations  also  provide  that  pressure  sores  be \nadequately  treated as  follows: \n(c)  Pressure  sores.  Based  on  the  comprehensive  assessment  of \na  resident,  the  facility must  ensure  that--\n(1)  A resident who  enters  the  facility without  pressure \nsores  not  develop pressure  sores  unless  the \ndo~s \nindividual's  clinical condition demonstrates  that  they were \nunavoidable;  and \n(2)  A resident  having  pressures  sores  receives \nnecessary  treatment  and  services  to  promote  healing,  prevent \ninfection and  prevent new  sores  from  developing. \n42  C.F.R.  §  483.25(c). \nDefendants  Chester  Care  Center,  Bishop  Nursing  Home  and \nManchester  House  Nursing  & Convalescent  Center  are  licensed  long \nterm  care  (nursing)  facilities  under  federal  and  state  law  and \nare  certified to  participate  in  the Medicare  and Medical \nAssistance  Programs.  The  Medicare  Program  is a  health  insurance \nprogram  for individuals  65  years  and  older,  certain disabled \nindividuals under  age  65  and people  of any  age  who  have  permanent \nkidney  failure.  The Medicare  statute is codified at  42  U.S.C.A. \n§  1395  (Title XVIII  of the  Social  Security Act) . \nThe  Medical  Assistance  Program is a  joint  federal-state \nprogram  funded  under  Title XIX  of  the  Social  Security Act.  The \n5 \n\nDepartment  of  Public  Welfare  administers  the  Medical  Assistance \nProgram  in  Pennsylvania.  As  a  prerequisite  to  enrollment 'as  a \nprovider  in  the  Medical  Assistance  Program,  all  of  the  long-term \ncare  facilities  that  are  the  subject  of  this  Complaint  entered \ninto  provider  agreements  and  agreed  to  the  following  provisions: \n1.  That  the  submission  by,  or  on  behalf  of,  the \nFacility of  any  claim,  either by.hard copy  or  electronic \nmeans,  shall be  certification that  the  services  or  items \nfrom  which  payment  is claimed actually were  provided  to  the \nperson  identified as  a  medical  assistance  resident  by  the \nperson  or  entity  identified as  the  Facility on  the  dates \nindicated. \n******* \n5.  That  the  Facility's participation in  the Medical \nAssistance  Program  is  subject  to  the  laws  and  regulations \neffective  as  to  the period of participation,  including  all \nof  those  that may  be  effective  after  the  date  of  the \nagreement  and  that  the  Facility has  the  responsibility  to \nknow  the  law  with  respect  to participation  in  the Medical \nAssistance Program. \nAt  all  times relevant  to  this  action,  Chester  Care  Center,  Bishop \nNursing  Home  and Manchester  House  Nursing  & Convalescent  Center \nwere  \"providers\"  with  valid provider agreements  with  the \nPennsylvania  Department  of  Public  Welfare. \n6 \n\nThe  Nursing  Home  Reform Act  also mandates  that  the  State \nshall  be  responsible  for  certifying,  in  accordance  with  surveys \nconducted by  the  state,  the  compliance  of  nursing  facilities \n(other  than  facilities  of  the  state) ...  The  Secretary  [Department \nof  Health  and  Human  Services]  shall  be  responsible  for \ncertifying .•. ,  the  compliance  of  State  nursing  facilities  with \nthe  requirements  of  such  subsections.  42  U.S.C.A. \n§1396r(g) (1) (A). \nThe  Pennsylvania  Department  of Health  is  responsible  for \nperforming  the  survey  function  of  long-term care  facilities  in \nPennsylvania.  By  state  regulation,  facilities  are  required  to \nmeet  the  daily nutritional  needs  of  patients.  28  Pa.  Code \n§  211.6(a).  Additionally,  if consultant dietary services  are \nused,  the consultant's  visits must  be  at  appropriate  times  and  of \nsufficient duration and  frequency  to provide  continuing  liaison \nwi th medica.l  and  nursing  staff and  provide  advice  to  the \nadministrator  and  participate  in the  development  and  revision  of \ndietary policies  and  procedures.  28  Pa.  Code  §  211.6(m). \nLong-term  care  facilities  are  also  required  to  provide \nnursing  services that meet  the needs  of  residents.  The  facility \nmust  nursing  staff to provide  nursing  and  related \nhav~sufficient \nservices to attain or maintain  the  highest  practicable physical, \nmental,  and  psychosocial  well-being of  each  resident,  as \ndetermined  by  resident  assessments  and  individual  plans  of  care. \n42  C.F.R.  §483.30.  See  also  28  Pa.  Code  §  211.12(a).  There  must \n7 \n\nbe  adequate  staff  to  provide  nursing  care  to  all  residents  in \naccordance  with  resident  care plans.  42  C.F.R.  §483.30(a) {l). \nIt  is 'incUl11bent  upon  the  director of  nursing  services  to  assure \nthat  \"preventive measures,  treatments,  medications,  diet  and \nother health  services  prescribed are  properly  carried out ... \"  28 \nPa.  Code  §  211.12 (e)  (9) . \nMoreover,  a  nursing  facility  is  required  to  retain  a  medical \ndirector who  is  responsible  for  the  \"coordination of  the medical \ncare  in  the  facility  to  ensure  the  adequacy  and  appropriateness \nof  the medical  services  provided  to  patients.\"  28  Pa.  Code \n§  211.2(k). \nFinally,  a  nursing home  administrator  is  charged with  the \ngeneral  administration of  the  facility whether  or not  his  or her \nfunctions  are  shared with one  or more  other  individuals.  63  P.S. \n§  1102(2).  According  to  regulations promulgated by  the  Nursing \nHome  Administrators  Board,  a  nursing home  administrator  is \nresponsible  for:  (a)  evaluating the  quality of  resident  care  and \nefficiency of  services,  (b)  maintaining compliance  with \ngovernmental  regulations,  and  (c)  developing policies which \ngovern  the  and  related medical  and other  services \ncontinuin~care \nprovided by  which  reflect  the. facility's philosophy \nth~facility \nto  provide a  high level of  resident  care  in a  healthy,  safe  and \ncomfortable  environment.  49  Fa.  Code  §§  39.91(1) (i), (ii), (vi). \nThe  Government's  complaint  charges  that  the  defendants \ncaused  the  submission  of  false  or  fraudulent  claims  to  the United \n8 \n\nStates  for  payment  for  care  that  was  not  adequately  rendered  to \nfrail  and  vulnerable  elderly residing  at  Chester  Care  Center  and \nBishop  Nursing  Home.  The  Health  Care  Financing Administration \nimposed  civil money  penalties  against Manchester  House  Nursing  & \nConvalescent  Center,  Bishop  Nursing  Home  and  Chester  Care  Center \nbased  upon  survey deficiencies  discovered during  1996  and  1997. \nFACTUAL  BASIS  FOR  COMPLAINT \nRESIDENT  1 \nResident  1,  a  resident  of  Chester Care  Center,  was  a \ndiabetic  who  suffered  from  multiple,  severe  conditions.  Resident \nl's vital  signs  were  taken daily  from  December  15,  1995  to \nDecember  19,  1995.  A blood glucose  of 20  mg/dl  was  reported on \n12/18,  a  seriously low  level  capable  of  causing  coma.  The \nnursing  note  indicated that  the  action  taken  would  be  to  \"report \nto  next  shift to  call MD  with  result.\"  No  further  vital  signs \nnor  clinical  assessments  were  recorded despite  a  potentially \ncoma-causing  blood glucose  level.  There  were  no  adequate \nassessments  performed by  the  staff and  Resident  1  ultimately \nbecame  unresponsive  on  January  2,  1996.  Resident  1  died of \nsepsis  and diabetic hyperosmolar  coma  at Crozer-Chester Medical \nCenter. \nRESIDENT  2 \nResident  2,  a  resident  of Chester  Care  Center who  was  unable \nto  speak,  was  admitted  to  Crozer-Chester Medical  Center  on \nJanuary  3,  1996  with  a  diagnosis  of  full  thickness  burns  over  43% \n9 \n\nof  her  body  surface  area  involving  the  upper  and  lower  limbs  and \nportion of  the  right  buttock  and  pelvic  area.  Resident  2  had \nbeen  placed  in  a  tub  of  hot  water  for  a  bath by  a  certified nurse \naide.  The  water  temperature,  when  measured  after  the  incident, \nwas  138  degrees  Fahrenheit.  Chester  Care  Center  had  knowledge  of \nthe malfunctioning boiler  and  been  cited by  the  state  Department \nof  Health  in prior  surveys  for  improper  water  temperatures  and \nhad  submitted a  plan of  correction  to  address  this  issue.  On \nJanuary  6,  1996,  Resident  2  died of  shock  and  sepsis  due  to \nthermal  burns  of  the  body. \nRESIDENT  3 \nResident  3,  a  resident  of  Bishop  Nursing  Home,  suffered  from \nprogressive  weight  loss  without  adequate  dietary interventions  to \nreverse  his  progressive deterioration.  Resident  3  weighed  149 \npounds  in early 1995  which  declined to  128  pounds  by October \n1995.  By  May  1996,  his  weight  was  125  pounds  and  at  a  hospital \nadmission  in August  1996,  he  weighed  113  pounds.  From  February \n1994  to May  1996,  Resident  3's serum albumin  level  declined  from \n3.6  gm/dl  to  2.5  gm/dl.  Resident  3  had been  hospitalized  in \nFebruary 199&: for 3  days  and was  hospitalized  in May  1996  for  13 \ndays  for  Resident  3's weight  declined  further  to \n~~rition. \n105  pounds  by November  1996  and  at autopsy  (February  1997),  he \nweighed  88  pounds.  Resident  3  also  suffered  from multiple \ndecubitus  ulcers  at his  hip,  sacrum and  genital  area,  which  were \n10 \n\nnot  healing  over  time.  There  was  no  underlying  condition  that \nwould  cause  Resident  3  to  lose  weight  and  develop  pressure  sores. \nRESIDENT  4 \nResident  4,  a  resident  of  Chester  Care  Center,  suffered  from \na  marked,  persistent  functional  decline  that was  not  addressed by \nthe  medical  care  rendered  at  the  facility.  There  were \ndisparities  between  the  recorded  vital. signs  at  the  facility and \nthose  recorded  at  the  hospital.  Resident  4's  ideal  body weight \nwas  139  pounds  which  declined  to  105  pounds  in  January  1996. \nEven  though  assessments  written by  registered dieticians  clearly \nidentified inadequate  protein being  recommended  for  this \nresident,  the  assessments  were  nonetheless  implemented.  Timely \nassessments  of weight  and protein status  and  revision of  the \nnutrient prescription when  it failed  to  achieve  its stated goals \nwere  non-existent.  Additionally,  there was  no  discussion of  the \nproblem of  recurrent  aspiration pneumonia  in  a  resident  receiving \ncontinuous  feedings  through  a  PEG  tube.  No  alternative  options, \nincluding placement  of  a  jejunostomy  tube  were  ever  considered. \nFinally,  there was  no  intervention  to  alter the  frequent \ntransfers ot tha resident  from  Chester  Care  Center  to  the \nhospital,  as her functional  level  declined  and  she  repeatedly \nreaspirated.  In  fact,· there was  little evidence  contained  in her \nchart  that Resident  4  received adequate  nutritional or physical \ncare,  or  comfort  at Chester Care  Center  to mitigate  the  pain  and \n11 \n\nsuffering  from  repeated  during  her  fatal \nhospitali~ations \ndecline. \nRESIDENT  5 \nResident  5,  a  resident  of  Chester  Care  Center,  was  admitted \nto  the  facility  in  February  1995  weighing  170  pounds,  101%  of  his \nideal  body weight.  Resident  5  was  a  diabetic  and  during  his  stay \nover  the  next  10  months,  experienced  five  hospitalizations. \nAfter  his  first hospitalization  in March  1995,  Resident  5's \nalbumin  was  3.2  gm/dl,  and  his weight  was  171  pounds.  Resident  5 \nwas  still independent  in eating and was  continent.  After  his \nsecond  hospitalization  in May  1995,  Resident  5's weight  was  165 \npounds  and  he  was  incontinent of bowel  and  bladder,  but  otherwise \nwas  able  to  assist with  his  care  and was  mobile.  During  the \nsubsequent  four  months  (May  1995  to  September  1995),  Resident  5 \ndeveloped  a  progressive  anemia  and hypoalbuminemia.
