    "summary": "<p>In February of 1973, this class action lawsuit was filed under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, on behalf of individuals detained at the Brooklyn House of Detention for Men in New York City. The plaintiffs sued New York City and its Commissioner of Correction. The plaintiffs, represented by the Legal Aid Society Prisoners' Rights Society, sought injunctive relief for the conditions of their incarceration. The plaintiffs' alleged violation of their constitutional rights on two fronts: overcrowding and the jail's proscription of all contact visits.</p>\r\n<p>To address overcrowding, the Brooklyn House of Detention for Men had resorted to \"double celling,\" a practice of housing two individuals in a single-occupancy cell. Similar claims made by plaintiffs at the Queens House of Detention were joined with this case for adjudication. On July 31, 1974, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Judge Orrin Grimmell Judd) held that double celling violated detainees' equal protection and due process, including privacy, rights and ordered the city discontinue the practice. On October 2, 1974, the court vacated its July 31 order and substituted in its place a new order that permitted double celling in certain, enumerated circumstances. The court also ordered that double celling broadly be eliminated by March 1, 1975.</p>\r\n<p>The Second Circuit Court of Appeals (District Judge John Reis Bartels, sitting by designation) affirmed the district court's findings of fact and legal conclusions. 520 F.2d 329. In its decision, the Court of Appeals relied on <a href=\"../../../../case/201/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Rhem v. Malcolm</em></a>, 507 F.2d 333 (2d Cir. 1974), which addressed similar concerns at the Manhattan House of Detention (\"the Tombs\"). The Court of Appeals adjudged the order too broad, however, because it reached all incarcerated individuals, not just those awaiting trial. The Court of Appeals also held that federal courts could order the city to release some of the plaintiffs, but could not mandate construction of new jails.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs' second claim, that their constitutionally protected rights were violated by the jail's policy prohibiting contact with detainees, was heard independently. The jail claimed that its policy facilitated visitation and assured jail security. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Judge Henry Bramwell) held that the jail's broad ban on contact visits was an impermissible violation of the plaintiffs' equal protection and due process rights. 421 F. Supp. 832. The district court reasoned that jail security could be maintained by proscribing contact visits only for the detainees it classified as security risks. The district court (Judge Bramwell) ordered the city to submit a plan for classification and contact visits within ninety days and allotted fourteen days for the plaintiffs to respond. A conference between the parties was scheduled for February 3, 1977.</p>\r\n<p>At some point in September 1986, the parties entered a stipulation that required the defendants, as a result of delays in replacing some windows at the detention house, to invest \"substantial additional\" resources toward recreation, education, and other programs. The court then entered an order on May 17, 1988, that detailed concrete steps the defendants would take toward effectuating that stipulation, including requirements relating to educational programs and the furnishing of additional equipment.</p>\r\n<p>We do not have the docket, pleadings, or record of any subsequent proceedings, but according to Legal Aid Society of New York, at some point the matter was consolidated with Benjamin v. Malcolm for enforcement purposes; see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that case</a> for more details for subsequent decades of litigation.</p>",

Lefkowitz, New York City (W. Bernard Richland, Corp. Counsel, L. Kevin Sheridan and Donald\nJ. Tobias, New York City, of counsel), for defendants-appellants.\nSteven A. Herman, New York City (William E. Hellerstein, Joel Berger and Michael B. Mushlin, The Legal Aid\nSociety Prisoners' Rights Project, New York City, on the brief), for plaintiffs-appellees.\n[*]\nBefore LUMBARD and OAKES, Circuit Judges, and BARTELS, District Judge.\nBARTELS, District Judge:\nJust recently this Court held in Rhem v. Malcolm, 507 F.2d 333 (2d Cir. 1974), that the conditions existing at the\nManhattan House of Detention (better known as \"the Tombs\") were so shocking and intolerable as to violate the\nconstitutional rights of equal protection and due process of pretrial detainees (\"detainees\"). Today we are asked\nto reach a similar conclusion in a different context relating to the conditions of confinement of detainees at the\nBrooklyn and Queens Houses of Detention (\"BHD\" and \"QHD,\" respectively). In November, 1970, Ralph Valvano\non behalf of a class of all persons incarcerated at the QHD instituted a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\nand 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201 in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Commissioner of\nCorrection of the City of New York and other City officials, alleging as unconstitutional the inhumane and\nunsanitary living conditions and administrative practices at the QHD, and in February, 1973, Ray Moctezuma and\nothers instituted on behalf of the detainees of the BHD a similar civil rights action against the defendants, alleging\nas unconstitutional similar living conditions relating to the custody of detainees at the BHD. Both complaints are\npatterned after the Rhem complaint and in effect protest essentially the conditions existing in the Tombs, such as\nrestrictive visiting hours, denial of contact visits, inadequate recreation, restrictive correspondence rules,\ninadequate care, inhuman and unsanitary living conditions and brutality by guards.\nOn September 7, 1973, the District Court consolidated the two actions but tried only two issues which were\ncommon to both the BHD and QHD: (1) the alleged unconstitutional overcrowding and, more specifically, the\nconfinement of two detainees in a single cell (double celling), and (2) the alleged unconstitutional excessive\nconfinement of detainees in their 5' ร 8' cells each day.\nImmediately before the trial, the Court personally toured both Houses of Detention. After a six-day trial during\nwhich it considered the stipulation of facts, the Manual of Correctional Standards, the testimony of detainees,\npsychiatrists, prison wardens and other experts in the field, the Court made comprehensive findings on July 31,\n1974, of the conditions existing at these two institutions. In its substituted order dated October 2, 1974, the district\n\ncourt decreed with respect to both institutions \"that beginning March 1, 1975 no person shall be confined in a cell\nwith another person without the voluntary written consent of both persons . . .,\" except in certified emergencies,\n395 and at the same time *395 it denied relief on the issue of excessive confinement on the ground that the two\nissues were interrelated and that the additional lockout time would result upon the elimination of double celling.\nOn October 2, 1974, the Court entered its judgment prohibiting double celling from March 1, 1975, as\nimpermissively restrictive and dehumanizing in violation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights in accordance with its\nopinion above. From this judgment and order the City has appealed and has obtained a stay which is presently in\neffect. Thus, we are concerned only with the issue of overcrowding.\nThe City does not attack the Court's findings as clearly erroneous but instead claims that double celling is not per\nse unconstitutional and that under the totality of circumstances existing at these two institutions, double celling is\na prison hardship that can be constitutionally justified. To this contention it adds another claim that the Court must\nin determining the constitutional minimum standards for detainees, look \"inter alia, to the needs and resources of\nthe governmental entity operating the jail.\" Upon this appeal we are not faced with the precise operating\n[1]\nconditions that existed in the Tombs in Rhem,  which were condemned as \"shocking to the conscience,\" nor\nwith any claim of structural defects as existed in that case, nor was double celling an issue there since it was\neliminated by a consent decree predicated upon a stipulation relating to overcrowding. To properly comprehend\nthe housing and living conditions to which these detainees are subjected while awaiting trial, a brief rรฉsumรฉ of the\nconditions as reflected by the Court's findings is necessary.\nFacilities\nThe inmates, including detainees, are housed in two units constructed relatively recently as maximum security\nmultistory institutions. The floors in both institutions are divided into four quadrants with two tiers of fifteen cells,\none above the other in each quadrant. All cells are rectangular 5 ร 8 feet, approximately 40 square feet in floor\nspace, containing two bunk beds, one table, one immovable seat, one unenclosed toilet and one mirror, and open\nonto corridors 90 feet long and 5 feet wide. There are no closets for clothing or personal effects of any of the\ninmates including detainees, and there is only one shower for each tier.\nThe rated capacity of BHD was 814 and of QHD 520, and in both instances is based on single occupancy of the\n5 ร 8 feet cells. The rate of occupancy for 1969-1973 was 170% of capacity at BHD and 153% of capacity at\nQHD. At the time of the hearings the rate of occupancy was 23% above capacity at BHD (998 persons) and 29%\nabove capacity at QHD (670 persons). The actual overcrowding was greater because 90 cells, which are\nincluded in the rated capacity, at BHD were usually unoccupied and one dormitory and 40 cells were not in\nservice at QHD. This resulted in the abnormal practice at both institutions of housing two men in a cell. Further\novercrowding resulted in the elevators and dayrooms in which there was an inadequate number of chairs, and\nalso in the lack of adequate gymnasium facilities; moreover, these gymnasium facilities were available generally\nonly once or twice a week for each detainee. Time out of cells was divided into three periods at each institution\nand at BHD the lockout time was approximately 8ยฝ hours and at QHD the lockout time was approximately 9ยพ\nhours per day. At both institutions the detainees were fed in their cells since the dayrooms at BHD and QHD\ncould not accommodate all of the detainees of a double cell section at one time.\nOnly 20% of the detainees required maximum security at both institutions but due to an inadequate staff and\nbudget, the classification system at both institutions has been and is inadequate. However, this issue, as well as\n396 other issues raised in both complaints, was not litigated in the district court. The more *396 positive aspects of\nthe two institutions include the fact that each institution has a gymnasium, a theater auditorium and an enclosed\nroof recreation area, the largest of which is approximately 3400 square feet, and also classroom areas and\nlibraries. Other advantages are that the institutions are close to the detainees' homes, there is a policy of non-\ncensorship of mail, a liberal access to the press, many minority correction officers and a large variety of activities\n[2]\nand programs which, however, must be suspended on weekends because of overcrowding.\n\nOvercrowding and Double Celling\nJudge Judd found that confining two detainees in a space of 40 square feet created personal problems, which he\nultimately concluded were dehumanizing. He stated that \"Two men cannot move about at the same time in the\nportion of the cell which is not utilized for bunks, table, seat, and toilet. Since the meals are fed to inmates in the\ncells and there is only one chair, only one man can use the table and the other must sit on the bed to eat; the\nchoice of who eats on the bed is made in varying ways, depending on seniority, rotation, strength, or other\nfactors. Disagreements concerning the choice of activities, embarrassment and discomfort in the use of the toilet\nin the presence of a cell-mate, and disagreements concerning personal belongings are common. Fights and\ncharges of theft are frequent, although fights between inmates who do not share cells are also common. Loss of\nprivacy is one of the major results of double celling.\"\nMany detainees testified as to specific dehumanizing incidents arising from double celling, such as bumping into\n[3]\neach other, the necessity of one detainee eating his meals sitting either on the bed or toilet,  the use of the toilet\nby one while the other is eating close by, and many other invasions of privacy. Correctional experts testified that\nconfinement of two detainees together not only deprives a detainee of privacy but also is psychologically\n[4]\ndestructive and increases homosexual impulses, tensions and aggressive tendencies.  In 1965 the United\nNations' Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders adopted a set of Standard\nMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which recommended that each inmate have an individual cell.\nThe Manual of Correctional Standards issued in 1966 by the American Correctional Association recommended\n(p. 49) that \"All cells should be designed for the use of one prisoner. The minimum clear size of an interior cell\n[5]\nshould be approximately 50 square feet, with an elevation of not less than 8 feet.\"\n397 *397 The sad and shameful history of penology in this country has been decried and condemned by many\nauthorities and it is hardly necessary at this late date to belabor the issue. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v.\nEisenstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676 (D.Mass.1973),aff'd,494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.),cert. denied,419 U.S. 977, 95 S.Ct.\n239, 42 L.Ed.2d 189 (1974); Brenneman v. Madigan, 343 F.Supp. 128 (N.D.Cal.1972); Inmates of Milwaukee\nCounty Jail v. Petersen, 353 F.Supp. 1157 (E.D.Wis.1973); Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark.1971).\nThe conditions in our prisons are inextricably related to our system of criminal justice and what might otherwise\nbe lawful detention becomes an unconstitutional restriction when those conditions become so dehumanizing as\nto constitute an additional hardship beyond the need for custody in violation of the detainees' due process and\nequal protection rights. The failure in the past of legislators to take the proper correctional action to remedy these\ninhuman conditions for both detainees and convicted prisoners has eroded the historical reluctance of federal\ncourts to interfere with the administration of penal institutions. Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800,\n40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972); Haines v. Kerner,\n404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Indeed this failure has required the courts to take action in\nthe interests of fundamental decency and the protection of the constitutional rights of the inmates. One of the\nfactors that bears upon the present condition of crowding in the City's correctional institutions is the backlog of\ncriminal cases pending in the State criminal courts, causing delays of weeks and months before a defendant,\nunable to make bail is brought to trial either because he lacks the fee or he is charged with a non-bondable\noffense. Despite some recent improvements by the State courts in reducing the waiting time for the trial of\ndetainees, neither the State nor the City has taken the necessary action to prevent or reduce overcrowding. See \nWallace v. Kern, 520 F.2d 400, 401 n.3 (2d Cir. 1975); Wallace v. Kern, 499 F.2d 1345 (2d Cir. 1974).\nHere we are concerned only with the confinement of pretrial detainees and not convicted inmates. The difference\nbetween these two categories and the necessity for different treatment have been frequently emphasized. Pretrial\ndetainees are no more than defendants waiting for trial, entitled to the presumption of innocence, a speedy trial\nand all the rights of bailees and other ordinary citizens except those necessary to assure their presence at trial\nand the security of the prison. In providing for their detention, correctional institutions must be more than mere\ndepositories for human baggage and any deprivation or restriction of the detainees' rights beyond those which\nare necessary for confinement alone, must be justified by a compelling necessity. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S.\n618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969); Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 91 S.Ct. 668, 28 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971); \n\nWilliams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488, 81\n398 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960); Collins v. Schoonfield, 344 F.Supp. 257 (D.Md. *398 1972); Seale v. Manson,\n326 F.Supp. 1375 (D.Conn.1971); Davis v. Lindsay, 321 F.Supp. 1134, 1139 (S.D.N.Y.1970); see Note, \n[6]\nConstitutional Limitations on the Conditions of Pretrial Detainees, 79 Yale L.J. 941 (1970).\nThe central issue here is the effect upon the constitutional rights of detainees of overcrowding, necessitating\ndouble celling and other human compression in the rest areas, such as lockout corridors and dayrooms. We\nrecognized in Rhem\nthat although the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment may not be applicable to the\ntreatment of unconvicted detainees, such cruel and inhuman treatment may in itself constitute a violation of due\nprocess and equal protection. We need not reach the questions whether double celling per se is unconstitutional\nor whether it is possible to construct cells of sufficient size and with sufficient accommodations to permit double\ncelling without deprivation of a detainee's rights. What we are faced with here is whether double celling in a cell 5\nร 8 feet, 40 square feet of floor space, creates such dehumanizing conditions as to deprive the detainees of their\nconstitutional rights of due process and equal protection. When a detainee is crammed into a 5 ร 8 foot cell\ndesigned for single occupancy with another detainee for fourteen to sixteen hours per day for an average of\nsixteen weeks, he is forced to suffer numerous indignities, invasion of privacy and risk of harm to his person and\nproperty.\nAs we have noted, double celling has been disapproved by various correctional associations and numerous\nexperts on prison reform. It has been specifically condemned by lower courts in Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v.\nEisenstadt, supra (cell 8 ร 11 feet); Tyler v. Percich, Civil Action No. 74-40C (2) (E.D.Mo., Filed Oct. 15, 1974)\n(cell 8 ร 5 feet), and also by State courts in Wayne County Jail Inmates v. Wayne County Board of\nCommissioners, Civ.Action No. 173217 (Cir.Ct. Wayne Co., Mich. July 28, 1972 and May 25, 1971), aff'd and\nremanded, 391 Mich. 359, 216 N.W.2d 910 (1974) (cell 6 ร 7 feet); Commonwealth ex rel. Bryant v. Hendrick,\n444 Pa. 83, 280 A.2d 110 (1971). Overcrowding alone in pretrial detention facilities above rated capacities has\nalso been held to create a restrictive and deplorable living environment constituting an intolerable violation of the\ndetainees' constitutional rights. Taylor v. Sterrett, 344 F.Supp. 411 (N.D.Tex.1972),aff'd in part, rev'd in part,499\nF.2d 367 (5th Cir. 1974); Hamilton v. Love, supra; Jones v. Wittenberg, 323 F.Supp. 93 and 330 F.Supp. 707, 714\n(N.D.Ohio 1971), aff'd sub nom, Jones v. Metzger, 456 F.2d 854 (6th Cir. 1972); Hamilton v. Schiro, 338 F.Supp.\n1016 (E.D.La.1970).\n399 The City concedes that the hardships associated with double celling of *399 detainees are not necessary for the\npurpose of confinement only, but it contends that there has been no showing of any violations of constitutional\nrights of the detainees at both BHD and QHD, citing Johnson v. Lark, 365 F.Supp. 289 (E.D. Mo.1973), and \nJones v. Wittenberg, supra. Those cases were addressed to the reduction of jail population in excess of stated\ncapacities and single cell occupancy was not litigated. At all events, insofar as they impliedly sanction double\ncelling in single occupancy cells, their rationale must be rejected at least in the circumstances in the BHD and\nQHD. The City attempts to justify the conditions existing at these two institutions upon the ground that double\ncelling in conjunction with the totality of other circumstances at these jails did not impose any substantial or\nadditional hardships on detainees above those necessarily caused by confinement in any large metropolitan jail.\nAssuming this statement to be accurate, the conditions existing in other large metropolitan jails can hardly be\nused as a criterion to justify double cell conditions of pretrial detainees in BHD and QHD. We agree with the\ndistrict court's finding that under the conditions here present double celling of pretrial detainees is constitutionally\nimpermissible.\nFinally, the City maintains that on balance the conditions here complained of are not so constitutionally offensive\nas to compel the City, given its limited jail facilities and financial resources, to build additional facilities to house\nthe prisoners in Brooklyn and Queens and elsewhere. Inadequate resources of finances can never be an excuse\nfor depriving detainees of their constitutional rights. Rhem v. Malcolm, supra, at 341, n. 20; Gates v. Collier, 501\nF.2d 1291, 1320 (5th Cir. 1974); Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir. 1968); Hamilton v. Love, supra; \nJones v. Wittenberg, supra. On the other hand, as the above authorities indicate, this Court is hardly in the\nposition to order the City to raise the necessary funds to build additional facilities. We can, however, order the\nrelease of persons held under conditions which deprive them of rights guaranteed by the Constitution unless the\nconditions are corrected within a reasonable time.\n\nFor a solution of the problem, we conclude that this proceeding should be remanded to the district court to\nconsider a proper remedy equitable to both the City and the detainees, keeping in mind the financial crisis facing\nthe City and the practical considerations necessary to prevent the detainees from being transferred to distant\nfacilities. Both parties should have an opportunity to make suggestions with the understanding that the City must\nact with reasonable promptness to provide facilities for pretrial detainees consistent with their constitutional\nrights. Inaction of course will not be tolerated nor will the present conditions be condoned.\nWe affirm upon the findings of facts and conclusions of law of the district court that the overcrowding and double\ncelling of detainees at the two institutions create an unconstitutional deprivation of their due process and equal\nprotection rights. Since the district court's order of October 2, 1974 is not limited to detainees, its restriction is too\nbroad and the court is accordingly directed to modify its order to limit the restriction to detainees only.\nAccordingly, we remand the case to the district court for the purpose of fashioning a remedy in the light of this\nopinion.\n[*] Of the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n[1] 371 F.Supp. 594, 599 (S.D.N.Y.1974).\n[2] High School equivalency programs are available and weekly movies are shown in the auditorium and periodic\nlive plays and concerts are presented by outside groups.\n[3] The discomfort of eating in a cell is not, of itself, an unconstitutional hardship within Sostre v. McGinnis, 442\nF.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1971),cert. denied,404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972).\n[4] Testimony of Donald H. Goff, Director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Prisoners' Rights\nProject; Dr. Augustus Kinzel, a practicing psychiatrist and instructor of psychiatry at Columbia University, New\nYork; Louis P. Gengler, Warden of the Federal Detention Center, New York City; Arthur Rubin, then Warden of\nQHD; and Robert B. McKay, Dean of New York University Law School, former Chairman of the New York City\nBoard of Corrections, and former Chairman of the New York Special Commission on Attica. \nMr. Goff testified that:\n\"One of the reasons why we have this emphasis upon one man to a cell and not having individuals in a very tight\nsituation is to reduce problems of administrators.\n\"You reduce your tensions, reduce the administrative problems, reduce the fights, sodomy, the anxieties simply\nby this technique [single celling]. It is a way of reducing and calming down a population which is normally under\npressure anyway (302a).\"\n[5] This manual was drafted by a committee which included the Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons;\nthe Chairman of the New York State Board of Parole, Russell G. Oswald; and the Commissioner of Corrections of\nthe City of New York, Anna M. Kross. \nSee also the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners adopted by the Council of Europe's\nEuropean Committee on Crime Problems (1955) and (1973) which recommends single celling.\nAs far back as 1790 the Walnut Street Prison in Philadelphia provided for individual cell blocks comprised of cells\neight feet by six feet and ten feet high. Gustave de Beaumont and Alexis de Tocqueville, On the Penitentiary\nSystem in the United States and its Application in France, 1833 (Carbondale, 1964), p. xxii, et seq. In New York\nState early in the 19th century the \"Auburn System\" was developed, the primary constituent of which was an\nindividual seven by three and a half foot cell. Clarence C. Schrag, \"Prison,\" Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1967, vol.\n18, p. 557. Even the infamous Newgate of Dickens's England had individual eight by six foot cells, as he\ndescribed in Sketches by Boz (New York, 1958 (originally published 1836-1837)), p. 200, et seq.\n[6] De Beaumont and de Tocqueville noted in On the Penitentiary System in the United States and its Application\nin France (1833) that: \n\n\". . . we have seen in the house of arrest in New York (Bridewell) more than fifty indicted persons in one room.\nThese arrested persons are precisely those for whom well-regulated prisons ought to have been built. It is easy in\nfact to conceive, that he who has not yet been pronounced guilty, and he who has committed but a crime or\nmisdemeanour comparatively slight ought to be surrounded by much greater protection than such as are more\nadvanced in crime, and whose guilt has been acknowledged.\n\"Arrested persons are sometimes innocent and always supposed to be so. How is it that we should suffer them to\nfind in the prison a corruption which they did not bring with them?\n\"If they are guilty, why place them first in a house of arrest, fitted to corrupt them still more, except to reform them\nafterwards in a penitentiary, to which they will be sent after their conviction?\n\"There is evidently a deficiency in a prison system which offers anomalies of this kind.\" (At p. 49.)\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The  parties  hereby  agree \nto  the  entry  of  an  Order  requiring  that  the  following \nmeasures  be  undertaken  to  enhance  activities  at  the  Brocklyn \nBouse  of  Betenticn: \n \ns\nPA 1.  The  Department  of  Correction  will  purchase  and \n \na\na\ninstall  for  use  at  BHD  the  items  listed  in  Appendix  A  to \nthis  Stipulation.  As  to  those  items  not  yet  received, \nGefendants  shall  make  a1l  reasonable  efforts  to  expedite \ntheir  purchase  and  installation  and  shall  provide  a  monthly \nupdate  on  the  progress  of  their  procurement. \n  \n  \n-j|- \n2.  Defendants  shall  maintain  at  least  the  current \nlevel  of  organized  instructional  programs  available  at  BHD, \nwhich  include  Basic  Education,  English  as  a  Second  Language, \nGED  prรฉparation,  pre-College  and  a  Diagnostic  Assessment  and \n  \nTesting  Center.  Defendants  shall  continue  to  train  and \n. \nutilize  inmate  tutors  to  assist  inmates  with  their  academic \nwork  and  correspondence  and  to  work  in  a  drop-in  Literacy \ni \n'.48SSistance  Center.  Academic  counseling  and  recruitment  for \nacademic  prcgrams  shall  be  ongoing. \n3.  Effective  July  1,  1988,  the  vendor(s)  hired  by \nthe  Department  of  Correction  to  provide  inmate  educational \nservices  at  BHD  will  be  required  to  supplement  the  existing \neducation  program  at  the  jail  with  additional  educational \nprograms  utilizing  the  video  technology  available  at  the \n \nfacility.  These  additional  educational  programs  may  be \n  \ninstructional,  e.g.,  such  general  education  courses  as \nCUNY's  GED  and  Learn  to  Read  videos,  or  may  be  less  tradi- \ntionally  academic  material,  e.g.,  VEL's  Video  History  of  the \n: \n20th  Century.  The  Department  will  report  in  writing  on  a \nmonthly  basis  to  OCC  and  plaintiffs'  counsel  on  its  plans \n  \nFor  complying  with  this  cverall  commitment  to  enhance  educa- \ntional  programs  at  BHD. \n4,  The  supplemental  educational  videcs  will  be \nincorporated  into  the  chapel  and  general  library  education \nprograms  and  courses  and  will  be  available  to  interested \ninmates  according  to  the  schedules  attached  as  Appendix  B. \n5.  Defendants  agree  that  detainees  enrolled  in \nany  educational  programs  at  BHD  will  not  be  transferred  to \nother  facilities  on  \"overloads\"  or  otherwise,  unless  and \nuntil  all  other  inmates  eligible  for  transfer  have  been \nexhausted,  or  unless  such  transfer  is  justified  by  articul- \nable  security  concerns  specific  to  the  inmate  being  trans- \nferred.  If  an  inmate  enrolled  in  an  educational  program  is \n \nr\ne transferred  he  shall  be  permitted  to  enroll  in  an  ongoing \np\no\nS\neducational  program  at  the  receiving  facility  if  space \nexists;  if  that  is  not  possible  he  shall  be  given  priority \nin  enrolling  in  the  next  available  school  program. \n6.  The  Cepartment  will  make  its  best  efforts  to \nair-condition  the  BHD  Chapel  by  June  30,1988,  and  in  any \nevent  it  shall  be  air-conditicned  no  later  than  July \n15,1988.  The  Chapel  will  be  used  to  provide  supplemental \neducational  programs,  as  discussed  above;  for  the  showing  of \n \nvideo  movies  and  special  programs  and  sporting  events \nreceived  through  the  satellite  dish;  and  for  live  special \nshows. \n7.  The  Department  will  shew  movies,  sports  and \nother  special  programs  in  the  air-conditioned  chapel  daily \nduring  the  evening  hours,  pursuant  to  the  schedule  contained \nin  Appendix  B.  Housing  areas  shall  be  rotated  to  different \nevenings  from  week  to  week. \n8.  J t Defendants  will  cun  a  recreation  recall  pericd \nGaily  during  the  evening  hours.  Hewever,  if  the  number  of \ndetainees  attending  evening  activities  in  the  chapel  reaches \nm  a \n-3- \n65,  recreation  recall  may  be  cancelled.  There  will  be  no \nlimit  placed  on  the  number  of  inmates  attending  evening \nchapel  activities  from  a  housing  floor.  However,  when  both \nthe  chapel  and  recreation  recall  are  running  simultaneously, \nlimits  may  be  placed  on  the  number  of  inmates  attending \nrecreation  recall  so  that  no  more  than  106  inmates  total \nwill  be  on  the  eleventh  floor  of  the  institution. \n9.  The  parties  agree  that  after  the  chapel  and \nrecreation  recall  program  have  been  in  operation  For  two \nmonths,  they  will  re-evaluate,  with  the  assistance  of  OCC, \nwhether  greater  numbers  of  inmates  can  be  accomodated  in \nthese  programs. \n10.  The  Department  will  fix  the  satellite  dish  to \nbe  installed  on  the  roof  of  BHD  on  the  Satcom  4  satellite \nwhich  will  be  capable  of  receiving  a  variety  of  programs, \n  \n   including:  Home  Sports  Entertainment;  New  England  Sport \n )i\nNetwork;  MSG  Network;  Sports  Channel. \n \nThe  television  sets  in  the  Chapel  and  Facility  day \nroams  will  be  connected  to  the  satellite  dish. \nThe  satellite  dish  will  be  capable  of  receiving  at \nleast  Four  channels  simultaneously.  Each  television  will  be \ncapable  of  independently  selecting  From  one  of  the  our \nchannels  programmed  for  reception  at  any  given  time. \nll.  Defendants  shall  make,every  reasonable  effort \nto  build  a  video  library  of  movies  and  sporting  events  for \nfuture  inmate  viewing  using  the  existing  Facility  videa \n-4- \n' \nresources  as  well  as  videos  purchased  pursuant  to  this \nagreement. \n12.  Until  the  new  air-conditioned  general  and  law \nlibraries  are  opened,  defendants  shall,  during  wacm  weather, \nhave  at  least  two  operating  fans  in  both  the  law  and  general \nlibraries  in  order  to  improve  ventilation. \n13.  All  of  the  equipment  being  purchased  pursuant \nto  this  agreement  shall  be  properly  maintained  and  repaired \npromptly  as  necessary. \n14.

The  Commissioner  shall  consider \nthe  detainee's  preference  between  attending  the  funeral \nor  the  viewing  but  reserves  the  right  to  make  a  final \ndecision,  provided  that  the  decision  shall  not  be  arbi- \ntrarily  made  and  shall  be  based  on  legitimate  security \nconcerns. \nSerious  Illness \nEach  detainee  shall  be  allowed  to  visit  with  any  of  the \nindividuals  listed  above,in  subparagraph  la,  when  there \nexists  a  substantial  likelihood  of  death  as  a  result  of \nan  illness  or  accident. \nWeddings \ni.

Attendance  at  the  events  described  in  subparagraph  1  above \nshall  be  permitted  for  a  reasonable  duration  of  not  less  than \none  hour,  except  where,  in  the  case  of  serious  iliness,  the  length \nof  the  visit  is  limited  by  the  treating  physician  or  the  rules \nof  the  hospital,  and  shall  be  subject  only  to  necessary  security \nprecautions.  Such  precautions  shall  be  as  minimally  intrusive \nas  possible,  and  defendants  shall  not  handcuff  detainees  during \ntheir  attendance  at  these  events,  except  when,  based  upon  the \nparticular  circumstances,  there  is  a  specific  determination \n-37- \nthat  security  considerations  require  that  a  particular  detainees \nbe  nandcuffed  at  these  events.  . \n3.  Defendants  shall  be  allowed  a  reasonable  amount  of  time, \nnot  to  exceed  48  hours,  in  order  to  arrange  attendance  at  any  of \nthe  events  described  in  subparagraphs  l(a)  and  (b)  above \nand,  unless  the  Commissioner  or  his  designee  has  determined, \naccording  to  the  requizements  of  subparagraph  1  above,  that \nthe  detainee's  attendance  at  a  particular  event  presents  a \nreasonable  likelihood  of  escape  or  serious  danger  of  bodily  harm, \nthe  defendants  shall  produce  the  detainee  at  the  event.  Defen- \nGants  shall  expedite  the  process  in  circumstances  where  it  is \napparent  that  the  event  will  occur  before  43  hours  and  in  such \ncircumstances,  if  the  request  is  made  at  least  24  hours  prior \nto  the  event,  shall  complete  the  process  by  that  time  unless in \na  vare  instance,  despite  every  attemot  to  do  so,  I+:  it  is  impossible \nfor  defendants  to  complete  the  process  in  time.  Where  the \n    \nDepartment  wishes  to  confirm  the  existence  of  an  event,  IP-  it  may   \ndo  so  by  any  means,  provided  that  such  method  is  as  minimally \nintrusive  as  possible  and  is  considerate  of  the  privacy  of  the \ndetainee  and his  family.  Where  the  Department  recuires \nconfirmation  of  the  event  by  the  detainee  or  his  family,  it \nshall  be  sufficient  for  the  event  to  be  confirmed  by  telephone \nor  other  oral  means. \n4.  Nothing  herein  is  intended  to  preclude  any  detainee  from \nseeking  a  state  court  order  requiring,  on  such  terms  as  the  court \nmay  direct,  the  defendants  to  transport  him  to  these  or  other \nfamily  events. \n5.  Nothing  herein  shall  preclude  defendants,  if  they  so \ndesire,  from  seeking  a  state  court  order  facilitating  the  meeting \nof  their  obligations  under  this  provision  of  the  stipulation, \nprovided  that  defendants'  obligations  and  vlaintifis'  rights  as \nset  forth  in  this  provision  shall  in  no  way  be  diminished  by \ndefendantsโ  seeking  or  obtaining  such  an  order. \n~38~ \n6.  Nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  as  addressing  the \nquestion  of  visits  by  detainees  with  their  new-born  children \nand  the  child's  mother  outside  the  institution.  The  parties \nreserve  the  right  to  litigate  this  issue. \n%.  HOUSING  FOR  HOMOSEXUALS,  TRANSVESTITES \nAND  TRANSSEXUALS \n1.  Defendants  shall  house  any  detainee  who  is  a  homosexual, \ntransvestite  or  transsexual,  and  who  requests  to  be  housed  apart \nfrom  the  general  population,  in  a  special  housing  unit  (herein- \nafter  \"separate  homosexual  housing\")  set  aside  solely  for  those \ndetainees;  provided,  however,  that  defendants  may,  in  accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  subparagraph  2,  place  such  a  detainee  in  a \nre i ct 8 f4- Q tive  or  specialized  classification  where  appropriate  and \nfor  reasons  unrelated  to  their  status  as  a  homosexual,  transves~ \ntite  or  transsexual. \n2.  Defendants  shall  not  deny  to  any  detainee,  or  ramove \n      \nany  detainee  from,  separate  homosexual  housing  except  where,  in \naccordance  with  the  due  process  safeguards  provided  in  sub-para- \ngraph  4  of  this  provision,  a  finding  has  been  made  that  an  in- \ndividual  is  neither  a  homosexual,  transvestite  nor  transsexual; \nprovided,  however,  that  where  appropriate,  and  in  accordance  with \ndue  process  safeguards  applicable  to  the  general  peopulation,  de- \nfendants  may  involuntarily  place  a  homosexual,  transvestite,  or \ntranssexual  detainee  in  restrictive  or  svecialized  housing  units \nwhich  shall  be  safe  and  secure  and  which  shall  provide  conditions \nof  confinement  no  more  restrictive  than  those  imposed  upon  general \npopulation  detainees  in  those  units  or  categories.  The  sole  fact \nof  a  detainee's  appearance  or  physical  mannerisms  shall  not  be \nadequate  justification  for  denying  or  removing  a  detainee  from \nSeparate  homosexual  housing. \n-~39- \n3.  Defendants  shall  not  place  a  detainee  involuntarily \nin  separate  homosexual  housing  unless,  in  accordance  with  the \ndue  process  safeguards  of  sub-paragraph  4  below,  there  is  a \ndetermination,  based  upon  substantial  evidence,  that  there  is \na  reasonable  likelihood  that  the  detainee's  presence  in  general \npopulation  will  pose  a  serious  threat  to  the  detainee's  safety \nor  to  the  safety  and  security  of  the  institution.  The  fact  that \na  detainee  is  a  homosexual  or  transvestite  shall  not  of  itself \nconstitute  substantial  evidence  or  adequate  justification,  nor \nshall  a  detainee's  appearance  or  physical  mannerisms  alone  be \nadequate  justification  for  involuntarily  placing  a  detainee  in \nseparate  homosexual  housing. \n4,  Prior  to  or  immediately  upon  placing  a  detainee  invol- \nuntarily  in  separate  homosexual  housing,  or  removing  a  detainee \nfrom  or  denying  separate  homcsexual  housing  to  a  detainea  who \n      \nrequests  it,  defendants  shall: \na.  Provide  the  detainee  with  written  notice  of \n(1)  the  reasons  for  such  housing  assignment  or \nits  denial; \n(il) . the  evidence  relied  upon  by  the  institution \nfor  its  decision;  and \n(iii)  the  right  to  challenge  the  decision  at  a \nhearing  before  the  institutional  classifica- \ntion  board  of  which  at  least  one  member  shall \nbe  a  psychologist,  trained  social  worker  or \npsychiatrist. \nUnless  the  right  to  a  hearing  is  waived  by  the  detainee, \nsuch  hearing  shall  be  held  between  24  and  48  hours  after \nthe  detainee  is  given  the  notice  required  by  this \nprovision,  or,  if  a  holiday  or  weekend  falls  within  the \n~40~ \n24  to  48  hour  period,  then,  at  the  option  of  the \ndefendants,  such  hearing  shall  be  held  on  the  first \nbusiness  day  after  notice  has  been  provided.  In  the \nevent  that  a  detainee  involuntarily  placed  in  separate \nhomosexual  housing  waives  his  ricght  to  a  hearing,  he \nmay  request  one  at  a  later  time,  and,  following  such \na  request,  a  hearing  shall  be  held  within  the  time \nperiod  specified  above. \nAt  the  request  of  a  detainee  who  has  been  removed  from \nor  denied  separate  homosexual  housing,  defendants  shall \nprovide  protective  housing  to  that  detainee  at  least \nuntil  a  post~hearing  finding  has  been  made. \nAt  the  hearing  before  the  institutional  classification \nboard  the  detainee  shall  have  the  right  to  appear \npersonally  and  to  make  a  statement;  to  call  witnesses \n    \n \nand  submit  documentary  evidence,  subject  to  the  hearing \nboard's  right  to  keep  the  hearing  within  reasonable \nlimits;  and  the  optortunity  to  confront  and  cross-examine \nwitnesses  whenever  the  hearing  board  cannot  rationally \ndetermine  the  facts  without  cross-examination.  I=  the \ndetainee  is  illiterate  or  if  the  complexity  of  the \nissues  makes  it  unlikely  that  he  otherwise  can  collect \nand  present  the  evidence  necessary  for  an  adequate \npresentation  of  his  case,  he  shall  have  the  richt to. the  assist- \nance  of  counsel-substitute  or,  at  the  option  of  the \ndefendthae nasstissta,nc e  of  retained  counsel. \nThe  hearing  board  shall  keep  notes  adequate  to  reflect \nthe  content  of  the  proceedings  and  to  furnish  a  basis \nfor  its  decision. \n-41~ \nIn  the  event  that  the  hearing  board  determines  that  the \ndecision  to  provide  or  deny  separate  homosexual  housing \nwas  justified,  it  shall  set  forth  its  reasons  and \nfindings  of  fact  in  writing  and  submit  such  reasons  and \nfindings  to  the  warden  within  twenty-four  hours  of  the \nconclusion  of  the  hearing.  Within  twenty-four  hours \nthereafter,  the  warden  shall,  in  writing,  with  a  copy \nto  the  detainee,  approve  or  disapprove  the  hearing \nboard's  decision. \nIn  the  event  that  the  hearing  board  determines  that  the \ndecision  to  impose  separate  homosexual  housing  was  not \njustified,  the  detainee  shall  immediately  be  transferred \nto  an  appropriate  housing  area  and,  if  the  decision  to \nimpose  involuntary  nomosexual  housing  is  reversed,  the \nDepartment  shall  exsunge  from  the  detaine  's  records \n     @  mn   \nany  and  all  references  to  his  period  of  classification \nand  housing  in  that  area.

Plaintiffs seek\ninjunctive relief, enjoining defendants from depriving BHD pretrial detainees their claimed constitutional right to\n833 contact visits. A contact visit is one where physical *833 contact is permitted between detainee and visitor. The\nfrequency or duration of visitation schedules is not at issue. There being no material factual issues genuinely in\ndispute, this Court holds that as a matter of law the denial of contact visitation at BHD is unconstitutional and\nmust be promptly rectified.\nThe Facts\nThis action is concerned solely with BHD, a pretrial detention facility under the supervision of the New York City\nDepartment of Correction. An inmate at BHD may receive visitors twice a week during daytime or evening visiting\n[2]\nhours.  During an average day, approximately 190 persons visit about one quarter of the detainee population.\n(Affidavit of Benjamin Malcolm, Commissioner of Corrections) A visitor enters the visitation area immediately\nadjacent to a street entrance, is identified, and proceeds to a waiting room on the visitors' side of the booths. A\ndetainee is brought from his cellblock area to the visitation area but he remains separated from his visitor by a\nglass partition. No physical contact is permitted. Conversation is limited to speaking and listening on a private\ntelephone in one of 54 booths. The telephones are maintained in good working order. (Affidavit of Benjamin\nMalcolm, Commissioner of Corrections)\nAccording to the affidavit of the Director of Planning For the New York City Department of Correction, based upon\nthe experience of Brooklyn detainees discharged between January 1, 1975 and March 31, 1975, the\n[3]\nincarceration period is generally of short duration.\nIn prior litigation involving contact visitation, the legitimate security concerns of the city corrections officials have\nbeen at issue. Here, we have a facility located in an urban area. Of the 648 detainees housed in BHD early this\nyear, 573 were Brooklyn residents at the time of arrest. (Affidavit of Benjamin Malcolm) The accessibility of the\nfacility to family and friends accounts for the high daily visiting rate which is in sharp divergence from the low\nvisiting rate at various upstate institutions housing sentenced prisoners. Further, statistics compiled by the office\n\nof the Commissioner of Corrections indicate that there has been an increase in the escape rate of detainees in\n[4]\nNew York City since 1973.\nContact visits are currently provided for pre-trial detainees in Suffolk County, see Mancicone v. Cleary, 74 C 575\n(E.D.N.Y., June 30, 1975); in Nassau County, see Palma v. Treuchlinger, 72 C 1653 (E.D.N.Y., July 11, 1975,\nFebruary 13, 1976); and at the House of Detention For Men on Rikers Island, see Rhem v. Malcolm, 527 F.2d\n1041 (2d Cir. 1975); Such visits are scheduled to begin October 5, 1976 at the Bronx House of Detention, see\nAmbrose v. Malcolm, 76 C 190 (S.D.N.Y., May, 6, 1976) In addition, such visits are the practice at the Federal\nHouse of Detention in New York City as well as in upstate adult facilities for convicted and sentenced prisoners.\n834 [5] Nonetheless, defendants refer to the testimony of *834 William Nagle, author of \"The New Red Barn\", before\nJudge Dooling in December 1975 in the case of the Detainees of the Queens House of Detention v. Malcolm, 73\nC 1364, stating that only three of the twenty-six detention centers he had visited throughout the United States\n[6]\nused contact visits as their principal method.\nEach housing tier at BHD has four telephones available throughout the day, free of charge, for the use of the\napproximately 120 inmates housed on the tier. Inmates also have contact with outside personnel during\nrecreation, counseling and various cultural programs.\nPlaintiffs assert that no genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to the current method of visitation and\nabsence of physical contact and thus no trial on these issues is necessary. However, defendants contend that the\nnumber of visitors, the location of the waiting room area, the escape rate for mainland pre-trial detainees, the\nshort duration of incarceration, the lack of time for classification procedures, the opportunity for telephone contact\nand the lack of nationwide practice of non-contact visits are material facts raising genuine issues which should be\ntried. Plaintiffs reply that none of these facts distinguishes BHD from the Tombs, or Rikers Island, or the Bronx\nHouse of Detention and therefore are not material. They assert that contact visitation is required as a matter of\nlaw and is a proper subject for summary judgment.\nDiscussion\nA federal court should grant summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Donnelly v. Guion, 467 F.2d 290, 293 (2d Cir. 1972). Affirming a summary judgment for the\nplaintiff in a prisoners' rights case, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that \"summary judgment as a\nuseful procedural tool is not to be discarded on the flimsiest of excuses; the issues of fact must be genuine, not\nsham.\" United States ex rel. Larkins v. Oswald, 510 F.2d 583, 584-5 (2d Cir. 1975). Those issues, contended to\nbe ones of material fact by defendants, are not issues which diminish the appropriateness of the remedy of\nsummary judgment. Rather, these facts play a role in determining the \"scope and implementation\" of contact\nvisitation procedures after judgment has been entered. Ambrose v. Malcolm, 76 C 190 (S.D.N.Y., May 6, 1976) at\n[7]\n4.\nIt is settled law in this Circuit that:\n[T]he demands of equal protection of the laws and of due process prohibit depriving pre-trial\ndetainees of the rights of other citizens to a greater extent than necessary to assure appearance\nat trial and security of the jail; and the same constitutional provisions prevent unjustifiable\n835 confinement of detainees under worse conditions than convicted prisoners. 371 F.Supp. at 623. \n*835Rhem v. Malcolm, 507 F.2d 333 at 336 (2d Cir. 1974). It is an uncontested fact that pre-trial\ndetainees are currently deprived of contact visits at BHD. Such deprivation of common forms of\nhuman communication at other detention facilities in the city has been held unconstitutional. As\nstated in the first Rhem case, such a visiting system \"which denie[d] presumably innocent\ndetainees . . . the right to shake hands with a friend, to kiss a wife, or to fondle a child, [is]\ninhumane and cruel in fact.\" Rhem v. Malcolm, 371 F.Supp. 594, 625-626 (S.D.N.Y.) aff'd507 F.2d\n333 (2d Cir. 1974) (contact visits at the Tombs), Rhem v. Malcolm, 389 F.Supp. 964, 968 (S.D.N.Y\n.) aff'd,527 F.2d 1041, 1043 (2d Cir. 1975) (contact visits at MHD on Rikers' Island).\n\nDefendants here contend that there exists a great difference between BHD and the aforementioned facilities\nwhich use contact visitation procedures. However, a similar argument was proposed and rejected in the first \nRhem decision in that the defendants there tried to distinguish the Rikers Island situation from that of the Tombs.\nThe Court in the second Rhem decision stated that \"[A]n unconstitutional booth is no less objectionable because\nit sits on Rikers Island rather than in the Tombs.\" 527 F.2d at 1043. It must be added, \"or in Brooklyn\".\nIn reaching the conclusion that deprivation of contact visits in BHD is unconstitutional, this Court utilizes the\nstandard enunciated by the Second Circuit in an earlier appeal of this case:\n[i]n providing for . . . detention, correctional institutions must be more than mere depositories for\nhuman baggage and any deprivation or restriction of the detainees' rights beyond those which are\nnecessary for confinement alone, must be justified by a compelling necessity. (citations omitted)\nDetainees of Brooklyn House of Detention For Men v. Malcolm, supra, 520 F.2d at 397.\nCertainly it is essential that institutional security be maintained, but concern for safety factors does not\nnecessarily preclude contact visits. Each of the conditions present at BHD existed at the Tombs. Both are in\n[8]\nurban settings, accessible to visits, with the Tombs having slightly more visitors per day.  While the deprivations\nat BHD are not as severe as they appear to have been at the Tombs, there remains no legitimate reason for\ndenying detainees rights to which they are constitutionally entitled.\nThis Court is not unaware of the City's concern with the security of its institution and the possible effect contact\nvisits may have on this legitimate concern. However, the feasibility of a classification system to determine which\ninmates are security risks and thus should not participate in contact visits has been upheld. Rhem v. Malcolm,\nsupra, 507 F.2d at 338. Commissioner Malcolm's assertion that even low bail detainees attempt escape and that\nthe short duration of incarceration makes identification of security problems difficult, do not appear to be\noverwhelming obstacles and are not reasons for denying plaintiffs fundamental constitutional rights.\nIn short, the security of the institution (exclusion of contraband) and the risk of escape appear to be no greater at\nBHD than at the Tombs, provided that a system of classification is used to screen high risk detainees who should\nbe denied contact visits.\nMoreover, the fiscal difficulties of New York City cannot absolve the defendants of their constitutional obligations.\nThis argument has been dismissed repeatedly by the Court of Appeals in this Circuit, reminding us that \"an\nindividual's constitutional rights may not be sacrificed on the ground that the city has other and more pressing\npriorities. . . . Denial of the presumptively innocent detainee's constitutional rights represents an impermissible\nprice to pay for this retention in custody.\" Rhem v. Malcolm, supra, 527 F.2d at 1043-44. In fact, a prior appeal in\n836 this case led *836 the Second Circuit to state that \"inadequate resources of finances can never be an excuse for\ndepriving detainees of their constitutional rights.\" Detainees of the Brooklyn House of Detention For Men v.\nMalcolm, supra, 520 F.2d at 399. The financial troubles of the City may, of course, be a factor to consider in the\nplan which will result from this order.\nIt is therefore SO ORDERED that the City of New York submit a plan to provide contact visits for all detainees\nother than those who are identified as security risks. The criteria for designating a detainee as a security risk\nshould be included in the plan. The plan is to be submitted within 90 days. Plaintiffs are to reply within 14 days,\nindicating their view on the appropriateness of the plan. The Court will meet with the attorneys for both sides on\nFebruary 3, 1977 at 10:00 A.M. Defendants are invited to request a conference early in the 90 day period if any\nproblems arise.\n[1] This case was previously before The Honorable Orrin Judd, who had ruled on questions related to double\ncelling, optional lockout, adequacy of recreation and daytime facilities, and eating arrangements in both BHD and\nthe Queens House of Detention (QHD). Detainees v. Malcolm, 73 C 261, Valvano v. Malcolm, 70 C 1390 (July\n31, 1974) aff'd, 520 F.2d 392 (2d Cir. 1975). Due to the untimely death of Judge Judd who labored arduously over\nthis case, the remaining issues have been assigned to Judge Henry Bramwell. Reargument on contact visitation\nhas been held.\n\n[2] As of September 13, 1976, a new visiting schedule is in effect, but this change does not affect the question of\ncontact visitation.\n[3] The statistics show that 16.8% were incarcerated for one day or less; 27.2% for two days or less; 35.2% for\nthree days or less; 43% for four days or less; 52.9% for one week or less; 81.1% for 30 days or less; 85.9% for\n45 days or less and 89.3% for 60 days or less. These figures are represented to be typical of other quarters\nduring the year. (Affidavit of Stuart Chagrin, Director of Planning).\n[4] In 1973, the rate was 13 escapes per 1000 inmates compared to 79 escapes during the first five months of\n1975. The recapture rate of escapees from mainland facilities is below that of escapees from Rikers Island. In\n1975, of 34 escapes from Rikers Island, 28 were recaptured as contrasted with eight of 14 escapees from\nmainland facilities. (Affidavit of Arnett Gaston).\n[5] The City has conceded that contact visits are required at the Adolescent Remand Center on Rikers Island. \nSee Maldonado v. Malcolm, 76 C 2854 (S.D.N.Y., filed June 28, 1976). Plaintiffs' supplementary affidavit dated\nAugust 5, 1976 submits that on June 22, 1976, at public hearings conducted by the New York City Board of\nCorrection, defendant Commissioner of Correction Benjamin J. Malcolm gave oral testimony stating that \"plans\nare underway to have contact visits in all institutions.\" But that, \". . . it's a money problem.\"\n[6] On the reargument of the question now before the Court, defendants indicated that if permitted to proceed to\ntrial they could prove that the national norm was to deny contact visits to pre-trial detainees. In light of the\npronouncements of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on the applicable standard for this Circuit. See infra at\n835, this Court is not impressed with the relevancy of that argument. Further, a series of recent cases from\ndistrict courts in other circuits indicates that the Second Circuit view may well become the national view as\nlitigation in this area continues. Miller v. Carson, 401 F.Supp. 835, 893-95 (M.D.Fla.1975); Dillard v. Pritchess,\n399 F.Supp. 1225, 1240 (C.D.Cal.1975); Campbell v. McGruder, 416 F.Supp. 100 (D.C.C.1975), at 12; Bay\nCounty Jail Inmates v. Bay County Board of Commissioners, Civil Action No. 74-10056 (E.D.Mich., August 29,\n1974), at 17-20. Two Courts have held that even convicted prisoners are entitled to contact visits. Pugh v. Locke,\n406 F.Supp. 318, 330, 334 (N.D.Ala.1976), Memorandum Opinion; Inmates, D.C. Jail v. Jackson, 416 F.Supp.\n119, 122-123 (D.C.C.1976).\n[7] Similarly, regarding defendants' contention that a mainland institution (such as BHD) poses greater security\nproblems than an island facility (MHD), that is not a difference which changes the constitutional requirement of\ncontact visitation. This Court is in agreement that \"while security considerations must be taken into account in\ndetermining the scope and implementation of a contact visiting program, they may not act as a bar to that right.\"\nId. at 3-4.\n[8] Information contained in affidavit of Joel Berger, dated February 20, 1976, based on testimony of Joseph\nD'Elia, Director of Operations, New York City Department of Corrections.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
