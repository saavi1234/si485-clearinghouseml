    "summary": "<p>In this case, private plaintiffs filed a civil rights class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana to challenge conditions of confinement at the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth (Tallulah). Plaintiffs were represented by the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Youth Law Center. The Amended Complaint, filed in October 1998, alleged claims under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. &sect; 1401 et. Seq. ; the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12131- 12133; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794 and Louisiana state law.</p>\r\n<p>The case was initially styled Brian B. by and through Robshaw v. Stalder, No. 3:98-cv-00886-JJB-SCR and was consolidated with U.S. v. Louisiana Civ. No. 98-947-B-1 and Williams v. Edwards. (See Related Cases.)</p>\r\n<p>In November 1999, the parties reached an agreement to resolve the education claims in the consolidated cases. The District Court (Judge Frank J. Polozola) approved the settlement and conditionally dismissed the education claims. (Final dismissal came in January 2003 when full compliance was achieved).</p>\r\n<p>In August 2000, the parties entered into the \"2000 Settlement Agreement\" which resolved the issues of juvenile justice; medical, dental, mental health and rehabilitative services; and access to the courts. The District Court approved the 2000 Settlement Agreement and conditionally dismissed those claims in October 2000.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2003, the parties entered into the \"2003 Settlement Agreement,\" which dismissed and/or modified various provisions of the 2000 Settlement Agreement. It also provided for the appointment of an Independent Expert to monitor compliance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs have  brought  a  civil action pursuant  to \n42  U.S.C.  §  1983  alleging violations  of  the  civil  and \nconstitutional  rights  of  juveniles  at Tallulah.  The  United \nStates'  complaint  pursuant  to  the  Civil  Rights  of  Institutional \nPersons  Act  (\"CRIPA\"),  42  U.S.C.  §  1997,  and  42  U.S.C.  §  14141, \nthe  Violent  Crime  Control  and  Law  Enforcement  Act  of  1994,  raises \nsimilar concerns. \nAs  an  initial matter,  it is  important  to  distinguish  the \nUnited  States'  action  from  the  Brian B.  class  action.  CRIPA \ngrants  the Attorney General  authority  to  institute a  civil \n-2-\n\nCase 3:98-cv-00947-FJP     Document 18     Filed 12/07/1998     Page 3 of 10(cid:10)\naction,  in  the  name  of  the  United  States,  in  the  appropriate \nfederal  district  court  for  such  equitable  relief  as  appropriate \nto  obtain  the  minimum  corrective measures  necessary  to  insure  the \nfull  enjoyment  of  the  constitutional  rights  of  those  residing  in \na  covered  facility.  42  U.S.C.  §  1997a(a).  The  Attorney \nGeneral's  authority extends  to  initiating suit  u~for or  in  the \nname  of  the  United  States,'  in order  to  represent  the  national \ninterest  in  securing  constitutionally adequate  care  for \ninstitutionalized citizens.\"  H.R.  Conf.  Rep.  No.  897,  96th  Cong., \n2d  Sess.  13  (1980).  The  authority delegated  to  the Attorney \nGeneral,  however,  does  not  supplant  actions  brought  by  aggrieved \npersons  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  In  fact,  Congress  noted \nthat  the  enactment  of  CRIPA  was  Unot  intended  to  expand  or \nrestrict  the  existing  rights  of  plaintiffs  other  than  the  United \nStates.\"  H.R.  Conf.  Rep.  No.  897,  96th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  11 \n(1980).  Similar authority has  been  granted  to  the Attorney \nGeneral  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  14141 (b)  to  seek  appropriate \nrelief  for  violations  of  rights  protected by  the  Constitution or \nfederal  law  ufor  or  in  the  name  of  the  United  States.\" \nFor  these  reasons,  the  United  States  may  maintain  civil \nactions  for  the  enforcement  of  CRIPA  and  §  14141  and may  seek \nequitable  relief  for  a  group  of  aggrieved  individuals.  The  class \ncertification requirements  of  Rule  23  do  not  apply  to  these  kind \nof  claims.  See General  Telephone  Company  of  the  Northwest  v. \nEEQC,  446  U.S.  318  (1980)  (EEOC  may  seek  classwide  relief without \nbeing  certified as  the  class  representative under  Rule  23) i \n-3-\n\nCase 3:98-cv-00947-FJP     Document 18     Filed 12/07/1998     Page 4 of 10(cid:10)\nDonovan  v.  University of  Texas,  643  F.2d  1201  (5th  Cir.  1981) \n(Secretary  of  Labor may  seek  class  wide  relief without  Rule  23 \ncertification) . \nThe  United  States  has  no  objection  to  class  certification in \nBrian  B.  We  agree  with plaintiffs  that  class  certification does \nnot  run  afoul  of  Fifth Circuit precedent.  In  fact,  certification \nof  the  Brian  B.  class  promotes  two  of  the  primary purposes \nunderlying  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23  -- the  avoidance  of  both \nduplicative  litigation and  inconsistent  standards.  See ~ v. \nMenke,  672  F.2d  702,  704  (8th  Cir.  1982). \nThe  cases  cited by  defendants  in their oppositions  to  class \ncertification are  inapposite.  For  example,  in Gillespie v. \nCrawford,  858  F.2d  1101  (5th  Cir.  1988),  the  Fifth Circuit  barred \na  Texas  inmate's  suit  seeking  equitable  relief where  a  class  wide \nconsent  decree  already existed  in Ruiz v.  Estelle,  679  F.2d  1115 \n(5th  Cir.  1982)  (class  action  challenging  conditions  of \nconfinement  in Texas  prisons)  and  the  inmate  was  a  class  member. \nThe  court  reasoned  that: \nPermitting mUltiple  courts  to  entertain equitable \nclaims  and  issue  decrees  that  might  affect  the  Texas \nprison  system would  require  other  courts  to  become \nfamiliar  with  the Ruiz decree,  the  current problems  of \nthe  Texas  prison  system,  and  the  possible  disruptive \neffect  of  the  exercise  of  equitable powers  over matters \ncovered by  the Ruiz decree.  Moreover,  if separate \nsuits  for  equitable  relief  are  filed  in other districts \nthan  that  in which Ruiz  is pending,  even  with  respect \nto problems  not  encompassed  by  the  relief granted  in \nRuiz,  the  court's  orders  may  hobble  the  effect  of  the \nRuiz  court's  continuing decree  over  the  Texas  prison \nsystem and  its power  both  to  enforce  and  to modify  that \ndecree. \nGillepsie,  858  F.2d  at  1103. \n-4-\n\nCase 3:98-cv-00947-FJP     Document 18     Filed 12/07/1998     Page 5 of 10(cid:10)\nThe  concerns  voiced  in Gillespie  the  avoidance  of \nduplicative  or  inconsistent  decisions  are  absent  here.  The \nproposed  class  action  in Brian B.  requests  equitable  relief  aimed \nat  curing problems  at  the  Tallulah Correctional  Center  for  Youth. \nThe  scope  of  such  relief  surpasses  that  currently provided  for  in \nWilliams,  which  primarily addresses  staffing ratios, \novercrowding,  and  fire  safety  issues.  Furthermore,  the \ncoordination of  Williams  and  Brian B.  by  the  Court  would  guard \nagainst  inconsistent  directives.  Finally,  the  proposed  class \naction more  effectively preserves  judicial  resources, than  the \nalternative proposed by  defendants  whereby  juveniles at Tallulah \nwould  be  forced  to  intervene  individually and  request  broader \nrelief  than  currently provided  for  in Williams.  See  State \nDefendants'  Memorandum  in Opposition  to  Certification at  4. \nDefendants  Trans  American  and  James  R.  Brown  also  contend \nthat  the  proposed  class  fails  to  satisfy the  requirements  of  Fed. \nR.  Civ.  P.  23. 1  This  contention  should be  rejected.  First, \nplaintiffs assert  that  systemic  problems  infect  the  Tallulah \nfacility.  Such  claims  satisfy Rule  23's  commonality  requirement. \n\"The  commonality  test  is met  when  there  is  \"'at  least one  issue \nwhose  resolution will  affect  all  or a  significant  number  of  the \nlFed.  R.  Civ  .  P.  23 (a)  provides:  \"One  or more  members  of  a \nclass may  sue  or be  sued  as  representative parties  on  behalf  of \nall  only  if  (1)  the  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder of , all \nmembers  is  impracticable,  (2)  there  are  questions  of  law  or  fact \ncommon  to  the  class,  (3)  the  claims  or defenses  of  the \nrepresentative  parties  are  typical  of  the  claims  or defenses  of \nthe  class,  and  (4)  the  representative  parties  will  fairly  and \nadequately protect  the  interests  of  the  class.\" \n-5-\n\nCase 3:98-cv-00947-FJP     Document 18     Filed 12/07/1998     Page 6 of 10(cid:10)\nputative  class members. ,,,  Forbush v.  J.C.  Penny  Co.,  994  F.2d \n1101,  1105  (5th  Cir.  1993)  (quoting  Stewart  v.  Winter,  669  F.2d \n328,  335  (5th  Cir.  1982».  Although  there  are  particular factual \ndifferences  in the  incidents  alleged,  such  incidents  stem  from \nthe  infirmities which  exist  at Tallulah. \nSecond,  like  commonality,  the  threshold  requirements  for \ntypicality are  not  high.  Shipes  v.  Trinity  Indus.,  987  F.2d  311, \n316  (5th  Cir.  1993).  As  with  commonality,  a  strong  similarity of \nlegal  theories  will  satisfy the  typicality requirement  despite \nfactual  differences.  The  \"typicality\"  requirement  focuses  on  the \nsimilarity of  the  legal  and  remedial  theories  behind  the  putative \nclass'  claims.  Jenkins  v.  Raymark  Indus.,  782  F.2d  468,  472  (5th \nCir.  1986).  Typicality  is established when  the  claims  of  the \nnamed  plaintiffs  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  class  and  are \nso  interrelated with those  of  the  class  that  the  interests  of  the \nclass  will be  fairly  and  adequately protected.  The  named \nplaintiffs  in Brian B.  have  suffered  from  the  same  practices  and \npolicies  that  injure  or will  injure  the  class.  The  harm  to  the \nnamed  plaintiffs  and  to  the  class members  is  substantially the \nsame.  The  typicality requirement  is  clearly satisfied. \nThird,  the  Brian B.  class  members  are  adequately  represented \nby  the  named  plaintiffs.  The  interests  of  the  named plaintiffs \nare  functionally  identical  to  the  interests  of  the members  of  the \nclass  they  seek  to  represent.  We  disagree  with  the  contention of \nDefendants  Trans-American  and  James  R.  Brown  that  the  juvenile \non-juvenile  violence  claim creates  a  conflict  in representing  the \n-6-\n\nCase 3:98-cv-00947-FJP     Document 18     Filed 12/07/1998     Page 7 of 10(cid:10)\nclass.  The  juvenile-on-juvenile violence  8laim  is part  of  the \noverall  claim that  the  defendants  fail  to  take  adequate  steps  to \nprovide  reasonable  safety to  juveniles.  None  of  the  proposed \nclass  members  is  a  defendant  in  this  action;  it is  the  named \ndefendants'  actions,  not  the  juveniles'  conduct,  that  will  be  on \ntrial  in  this  case.  £ee alaQ,  Langley  v.  Coughlin,  715  F.  Supp. \n522,  561  (S.D.N.Y.  1989)  (that  several  inmates  have  been \npresumably  unwitting  agents  for  creating some  of  the  alleged \nunconstitutionally permissible  conditions  did not  demonstrate  a \nlegally cognizable  conflict between  them  and  other  class  members \nwhich  would  preclude  certification).  As  such,  the  interests of \nthe  proposed  class  members  are  not  in conflict  for  they  seek  to \nvindicate  the  same  legal  rights. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  these  reasons,  the  United  States  has  no  objection  to \nclass  certification in Brian B. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nBill  Lann  Lee \nActing Assistant \nAttorney General \nCivil  Rights  Division \nSteven  H.

The Court also set a hearing for October 3, \n2000 to consider any objections filed to the Settlement Agreement. A review of the record \nreveals that no objections have been filed. Since no objections have been filed, there is no \nneed for the Court to conduct a hearing on the Settlement Agreement. \nTherefore, the Settlement Agreement is hereby approved by the Court. These cases will be \nadministratively closed until further order of the Court. It shall not be necessary for the \nparties to file any additional monthly or incident reports with the Court. However, the parties \nshall continue to send these reports to the Court's expert. \nThis is a historic day for the State of Louisiana, the parties, and this Court. By approving this \nSettlement Agreement, the Court has now transferred to the State of Louisiana FULL \nRESPONSIBILITY for running its adult and juvenile prisons in a constitutional manner. It is \nthis Court's belief that the State of Louisiana is now capable of running its own prisons in \naccordance with the Settlement Agreement, the Constitution and laws of the United States \nwithout the assistance of a federal judge. However, should those in charge of 945*945 the \nLouisiana prison system fail or refuse to comply with this Settlement Agreement or \n\n \notherwise fail to operate its juvenile prison system in a constitutional manner, this Court will \nbe forced to reopen the case. Thus, my final statement to the State of Louisiana is very \nsimple—run your own juvenile prisons in a constitutional manner or a federal judge will be \nrequired to do so for you. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n                           ATTACHMENT \n \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL, MENTAL HEALTH, \n     \n            REHABILITATION AND JUVENILE JUSTICE ISSUES\n \n \n                      TABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n  I.

This Agreement settles and resolves four lawsuits \n(the \"Lawsuits\") concerning the juvenile justice, medical, dental, mental health, and \nrehabilitative services in the State of Louisiana's secure juvenile facilities. The four Lawsuits \nsettled by this Agreement are: (1) Williams v. McKeithen, Civ. No. 71-98 (including the \nfollowing sub-dockets opened in that action: In Re: Juvenile Facilities, Civ. No. CH 97-MS-\n001-B; In Re: Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth, Civ. No. CCH 97-0665-B-M1; In Re: \nJetson Correctional Center for Youth, Civ.

No. 00-246-CMI; and (4) United States v. \nLouisiana, Civ. No. 98-0947-B-1. In order to resolve the juvenile justice, medical, dental, \nmental health, and rehabilitation issues in this litigation, the parties have entered into this \nAgreement, which, if complied with within the time frames specified below, will result in the \ndismissal of the Lawsuits, except as provided in ¶ 9 below. The terms of this Agreement \n\n \nshall apply to the secure juvenile facilities operated by or on behalf of the State and any \nother secure juvenile facility opened 946*946 during the life of the Agreement. All parties \nagree and recognize that the obligations contained in this Agreement and any remedies \nflowing therefrom are limited to conditions within the secure juvenile facilities and do not \nfollow the juvenile after his/her final discharge from the facility. This provision shall not \nprevent the DPSC from continuing its current practice of providing short-term medications. \nThis Agreement shall not increase or decrease any rights that juveniles held in secure \nfacilities, on parole, or on probation supervision may or may not have upon their release \nfrom secure facilities. \n2. As part of this Agreement, the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (\"DPSC\") \nshall revise as necessary its policies and procedures to ensure that they are consistent with \nthe provisions of this Agreement. \n3. The State denies any allegations upon which the Lawsuits are based. The State has \nentered this Agreement' in order to avoid the cost and uncertainty of litigation. \n4. The United States' Jena Agreement and the Private Plaintiffs' Jena Agreement, both \nentered on or about April 13, 2000, are terminated and are of no further effect. The State \nagrees not to house juveniles at the Jena Juvenile Justice Center in Jena, Louisiana during \nthe term of this Agreement. \n5. Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, the parties shall jointly move the Court for \nan Order to conditionally dismiss the Lawsuits except as provided in ¶ 9 below. Immediately \nupon execution of this Agreement, the parties shall jointly move the Court for an Order \nterminating and rescinding all existing, orders, judgments or decrees that purport to address \nconditions of confinement in Louisiana's secure juvenile facilities, except as set forth in this \nparagraph: \na. Consent orders. The effect of the following consent orders is stayed until either: (a) final \ndismissal of these actions, at which time all consent orders shall be terminated and shall \nhave no prospective effect; or (b) 120 days following entry of an order reopening these \nactions: \nApril, 1996 Order (Bridge City Correctional Center), \nNovember 14, 1996 Order (Swanson Correctional Center for Youth-Monroe), \nApril, 1998 Order (Jetson Correctional Center for Youth), and \nNovember 15, 1994 Order (Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth), as modified by orders \ndated February 21, 1995, November 19, 1996, December 22, 1995, November 12, 1997, \nNovember 20, 1997, December 16, 1997, December 23, 1997 and March 10, 1998. \nb.

If a full investigation (see ¶ 26 a—i) is not \nwarranted, then the reasons why a full investigation is not conducted shall be documented \nin writing. In cases where a juvenile withdraws an allegation, the investigators shall record \nthe investigation on the log, conduct a preliminary investigation to determine the \ncircumstances and reasons for the withdrawal, and in cases where it is warranted, complete \nthe investigation of the abuse allegation.

Identifying and interviewing privately, separately and in-person, all possible witnesses, \nincluding other juveniles and staff in the building or unit at the time of the incident; \ne. Examining the juvenile's and staff member's institutional, personnel and other records, \nincluding any prior allegations of abuse against the staff person whether substantiated or \nnot; \nf. Staff and juvenile witnesses to the alleged abuse are not, at any time after an incident, \nquestioned or interviewed by staff who due to their assignments and/or relationship with the \nalleged perpetrator have or appear to have a conflict of interest in investigating the \nallegation; \ng. Whenever there is reason to believe that a juvenile may have been subjected to physical \nsexual abuse, the juvenile is examined by non-DPSC health care personnel with special \ntraining and experience in conducting such assessments; \nh. For all investigations not completed within ten working days, notification detailing the \nneed for additional time and an estimate of the additional time needed shall be provided to \nthe supervisory investigators; and \ni.

The State shall employ trained, independent investigators at each facility with adequate \nexperience and training in investigations to accomplish these tasks. The investigators shall \n\n \nprepare comprehensive written investigation reports, setting forth their complete \ninvestigative findings and the basis of their findings. The reports shall be simultaneously \nforwarded to the facilities' wardens and supervising PZT investigators at Headquarters. \nThese investigators shall report to the wardens of the facilities. If the warden is personally \ninvolved in a particular incident, then a PZT investigator assigned from DPSC Headquarters \nshall conduct the investigation. \n29. The State shall employ at least the following number of FTE investigators within 12 \nmonths of the effective date of the Agreement: \n  JCCY       3 \n \n  SCCY       2 \n \n  BCCY       1.5 \n \n  SCCY-M     3 \nIn addition, the State shall employ two supervisory investigators who shall supervise and \nassist the investigators and who shall monitor all calls made to the PZT Hotline. The \nsupervisory investigators shall report to the Office of the Secretary and shall implement \npolicies and procedures for the investigation of allegations of neglect, abuse, violence, \nexcessive use of force, and serious injury system-wide. \n30. Within three months of the effective date of this Agreement, the State shall ensure that: \na. all employees or contractors against whom physical abuse or sexual misconduct is \nsubstantiated shall be appropriately processed through a performance appraisal action or \ndisciplinary action. \nWhere significant physical abuse or sexual misconduct is substantiated, or where there is a \npattern of substantiated abusive behavior, the employee or contractor shall be terminated \nand shall not knowingly be employed at another secure juvenile facility; \nb. allegations of criminal sexual misconduct and physical abuse by staff resulting in \nlacerations requiring sutures, fractures, serious injuries, or death are referred for evaluation \nof the appropriateness of criminal prosecution to state authorities, the United States \nAttorney's Office in the district in which the facility is located, and the Criminal Section of the \nCivil Rights Division of the Department of Justice; and \nc. Any staff member under investigation for physical abuse or sexual misconduct 952*952 \nshall be separated from any contact with juveniles or placed on leave if the State has a \nreasonable basis to believe that abuse or sexual misconduct warranting termination of \nemployment may have occurred. \n31. The State shall keep records of the results of every PZT investigation at the facility and \nin a central registry maintained by the State. These records shall be maintained in a manner \nthat permits investigators and other appropriate personnel to easily access every PZT \ninvestigation involving a particular staff member or juvenile. A copy of the \nsummary/conclusion portion of every PZT investigation substantiating misconduct by staff \nshall be permanently placed in the staff member's personnel record. \n\n \n32. Within nine months of effective date of this Agreement, the State shall establish the \nMultiple Allegation Database (MAD). This database will be used to screen for staff with \nmultiple allegations to determine those whose behavior may need to be modified. \na. The MAD shall collect and record the staff's complete name, the date of each allegation \nof abuse or misconduct against the staff, the date each alleged event occurred, the name of \nthe staff or juvenile making the allegation of abuse or misconduct against the staff, the \nidentifying number of the investigation done in response to the allegation, the outcome of \nthe investigation, and the discipline, training, or counseling imposed or mandated as a result \nof the investigation, if any. \nb. The MAD shall be maintained during the staff's employment and for five years after the \nstaff leaves employment. \nc. The Youth Programs Compliance Division shall review staff with three or more allegations \nof abuse or misconduct relating to safety or welfare of juveniles within a two-year period \nand, if warranted, take appropriate follow-up action (such as meeting with the staff, \nrecommending remedial training, counseling, transfer, re-assignment, or disciplinary action). \n33. As part of each PZT investigation, investigators shall examine the PZT investigation \nhistory of the parties involved in the current investigation. This shall include reference to the \ncentral PZT registry maintained by the State. \n34. The State shall document in the personnel record of every person hired after the entry \nof this Agreement that the facility has consulted the facility records and the central PZT \nregistry to determine whether the candidate has ever been the subject of a substantiated \nPZT investigation at any facility in the State and to review any other complaint history. \n35. No facility may knowingly hire any individual who has had an allegation of abuse \nsubstantiated against him or her that resulted in termination of employment or resignation to \navoid termination. In addition, the MAD shall be checked as part of the pre-employment \nreview process. And, to the extent possible, the MAD shall be updated within 180 days of \ncreation to include all cases of substantiated abuse that resulted in termination or \nresignation to avoid disciplinary action within the previous 365 days. \n36. Within four months of the effective date of this Agreement, the State shall confirm that \ncriminal background checks, as described herein, have been completed on all existing staff \nand the State will complete criminal background checks on all prospective employees and \nexisting employees whose background check does not conform to the requirements of this \nparagraph. A background check shall include checking with the National Crime Information \nCenter and the Louisiana Computerized Criminal History system. The State shall complete \n953*953 the above checks on all prospective employees before they have any contact with \njuveniles. Additionally, finger prints of all employees, existing and prospective, shall be \nsubmitted to the State Police in accordance with the Louisiana Child Protection Act.

The State may exceed the capacities of residential dorms by two float beds on a \ntemporary basis (up to four days) in order to accommodate transfers or other movements of \njuveniles within the facility. The State will not, however, increase the capacity of a \nresidential dormitory—even on a temporary basis—if such an increase would 954*954 \nviolate good correctional practice or would violate State Fire Code limitations. The use of \nfloat beds under this provision shall not result in an increase of the overall population limit \nfor any facility, as previously set forth in this paragraph. \nc. Within 12 months of the effective date of this Agreement, the State shall post correctional \nofficers and/or other direct care workers in housing units as set forth in ¶¶ 40-43. \nCorrectional officers assigned to residential units shall accompany the juveniles housed in \nthose units on a roughly proportional basis throughout the day. \nd.

Within 23 months of the effective date this Agreement, the State shall ensure that all \nstaff who have direct contact with juveniles are adequately trained and can demonstrate \ncompetence in the following areas: \na. stages of adolescent development; \n956*956 b. communication skills, including specific instruction on verbal de-escalation \ntechniques; \nc. behavior management and the management of aggressive behavior; \nd. basic training relating to juveniles with mental health issues, including recognizing signs \nof mental retardation, developmental disabilities and mental illness and appropriate \nmethods of interaction with such juveniles; grief and loss among juveniles; and measuring \nand monitoring behavior changes; \ne. crisis prevention and intervention, including the prevention and intervention in suicidal \nbehavior and self-mutilation; \n\n \nf. basic Constitutional and legal rights of juveniles in juvenile facilities; \ng. report writing; \nh. basic training relating to medical care, including basic medical terminology; recognizing \nand responding to seizure disorders; common side effects of prescription and non-\nprescription medication; and confidentiality of medical information; \ni. the physical and emotional needs of pregnant residents (for staff working with female \njuveniles); \nj. universal precautions to prevent infection with TB and AIDS; \nk. certification in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; \nl. accommodations needed for mentally ill and physically or developmentally disabled \njuveniles; \nm. fire safety and evacuation procedures and conducting of regular emergency evacuation \ndrills; \nn. use of force policy; and \no. Project Zero Tolerance and the grievance system. \n47. Within 23 months of the effective date of this Agreement, all direct care staff and all \ncase workers shall be taught effective, non-punitive ways to manage juveniles. Case \nworkers shall have a working knowledge of the rehabilitative and/or mental health treatment \nplans of the juveniles in their care. Direct care staff shall be provided enough information by \ncaseworkers regarding treatment and/or rehabilitative issues of the juveniles in their \ncaseload to facilitate the direct care staff's supervision of the juveniles. \n48. Within 23 months of the effective date of this Agreement, the State shall ensure that all \nstaff who have regular and routine contact with juveniles are adequately trained concerning \nthe standards for physical management of juveniles and what constitutes abuse. \na. Employees will take all reasonable steps to minimize situations requiring a use of force \nand to minimize the amount of force used in those situations. When possible, actions other \nthan use of force, such as staff presence, verbal directions and warning, crisis intervention \ntechniques, and passively removing a juvenile from an area of group activity without the use \nof physical handling, will be used; \nb. Force will be used only as a last resort to control the juveniles; \nc. The amount of force used will be proportional to the threat to which it is a response and \ncease when the resistance ceases; \nd. Force may be used only: \ni. To prevent an escape; \n\n \nii. To prevent an act which could result in death or severe bodily harm to the juvenile or \nanother person; \niii. To defend one's self or others against a physical assault; \niv. To separate participants in a fight; \nv. To prevent substantial damage to property; and \nvi. When necessary, to enforce legal orders and instructions. \n957*957 e. Whenever possible, force will not be used against juveniles with mental illness \nor mental retardation before appropriate medical, mental health, or counseling personnel \ncan be called to the scene. \nf. The first action taken to gain control will be direct, verbal instructions to cease the \nbehavior, unless the employee perceives that life or health will be jeopardized, or that there \nis a substantial threat to security. \ng. When determining the need to use force, factors to be considered include but are not \nlimited to: lack of appropriate response to repeated direct orders and other efforts to temper \nthe situation, severity of the situation and/or behavior, threat to self or others, and disruption \nto the unit or program. \nThe State shall ensure that within twenty-three months of the effective date of this \nAgreement and presentation to the Plaintiffs, the DOJ and the Court Expert of the training \ncourse material, all staff who have contact with juveniles shall attend a competency-based \ntraining course in restraint methods that will include passive restraint methods. Failure of \nexisting staff to successfully complete the program will result in adverse performance \nappraisal action and the training will be rescheduled. The State will use the performance \nappraisal to remove staff who repeatedly fail to meet the requirements of this paragraph. \nNewly recruited or hired staff must successfully complete the training prior to having any \ncontact with juveniles. The training program shall be tailored to adolescent correctional \npopulations, rather than adult correctional populations, and will include communication \ntechniques, basic counseling, conflict resolution, therapeutic interventions, and the physical \nand emotional needs of adolescents in addition to other accepted physical management \ntechniques. The material for the course shall be presented to the Court Expert, the DOJ and \nPlaintiffs for review prior to adoption. \n49. All new correctional officers shall receive a minimum of 120 hours of preservice training. \nAll other new staff shall receive a minimum of 40 hours of pre-service training. All staff with \nregular or daily contact with juveniles, including correctional officers, shall receive an \nadditional 40 hours of training each year. Staff with minimal contact with juveniles such as \nclerical/office staff shall receive an additional 16 hours of training each year. Pre-service \ntraining and annual training will include topics as described in ¶ 46. Under no circumstances \nshall newly recruited or hired direct care workers be assigned to supervise juveniles until \nthey have successfully completed competency based testing in all of the areas of training \nset forth in ¶ 48. This shall not apply to supervised on-the-job training. Correctional officers \nwho transfer from adult institutions to juvenile institutions must complete the components of \ntraining related to juveniles prior to assuming their duties. Failure of existing staff to \n\n \nsuccessfully complete the program will result in adverse performance appraisal action and \nthe training will be rescheduled. The State will use the performance appraisal system to \nremove staff who repeatedly fail to meet the requirements of this paragraph. The State shall \nmeet the requirements of this paragraph within twenty-three (23) months of the effective \ndate of this Agreement. \n2. Positive Behavior Management/Discipline \n50. The State shall develop and implement within 23 months of the effective date of this \nAgreement a uniform positive behavior management system for juveniles in the facilities. \nThe system shall be designed to provide incentives for positive behaviors and shall define \nspecific disciplinary consequences for 958*958 specific negative behaviors. The system \nshall be explained orally and in writing to all juveniles during the intake and orientation \nprocess. The explanation will include discussion of the adverse effects on early release \nconsideration that Schedule B disciplinary reports can have. \n51. Within 23 months of the effective date of this Agreement, staff shall be instructed and \ntrained to address minor behavior problems through informal counseling and the use of the \npositive behavior management system (including through the withdrawal of privileges). \n52. Upon receipt of a Schedule B disciplinary report, a juvenile shall have an opportunity to \nmeet with a designated staff member to discuss the disciplinary report. The designated staff \nmember shall offer to aid the juvenile in any disciplinary hearing on the disciplinary report \nand shall provide such assistance if asked. \n53. Every juvenile who receives a Schedule B disciplinary report shall receive a disciplinary \nhearing pursuant to disciplinary procedures as promulgated by the DISCIPLINARY RULES \nAND PROCEDURES FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS, First Edition, 1993 as amended by \nmemo of November 19, 1996, except as modified by this document. The polices and \nprocedures shall include: \na. Written notice describing the alleged violation(s); \nb. Impartial hearings before a disciplinary committee consisting of two employees \nrepresenting different programs of the institution. The disciplinary committee shall not \ninclude any staff person who was involved in the issuance of the disciplinary report. The \nentire hearing shall be held in private and tape recorded and shall result in written findings \nof fact and disposition. The tape shall be kept indefinitely; \nc. Right to an appeal. \nC. Classification \n54. The State shall issue and enforce classification criteria regarding housing assignments. \nThe criteria shall include applicable risk factors based on age, gender, maturity, size, \noffense history, institutional behavior and/or program participation, offense, education, \nmental health history and any special needs of the juveniles. \n\n \n55. Staffings shall be used to develop reports to courts of continuing jurisdiction, updating of \nthe case plan, and (except for STOP/LITE/juveniles and juveniles sentenced under \nprovisions of Louisiana Children's Code Article 897.1) determining if a juvenile has met the \nguidelines for or should otherwise be considered for a recommendation for reassignment, \nrelease, or discharge from a secure setting. Staffing determinations/recommendations shall \nbe based upon guidelines which primarily consider treatment protocols and/or continued \ntreatment provided through community/non secure programs, custody level, progress in \ninstitutional educational, vocational treatment programs and/or approved \neducational/vocational and exit plans. \nStaffings shall be held in private and shall normally be attended only by those staff involved \nin the staffing. Other staff such as the case worker's supervisor, Warden or other \nadministrators may attend as deemed necessary for supervision/observation purposes. \nEach staffing shall be attended by the case worker and at least two of the following \nindividuals: one of the juvenile's teachers (who shall be the juvenile's special education \nteacher if the juvenile is receiving special education services), the school's guidance \ncounselor/school psychologist/school social worker, a security staff member who supervises \nthe juvenile in the juvenile's living unit; a mental health professional providing individualized \nservices to the juvenile; or a 959*959 member of the medical staff who is familiar with the \njuvenile's medical care if the juvenile is receiving on-going medical treatment (e.g., for \nchronic health care needs). If not represented at the staffing, written comments or reports \nshall to be used in the staffing to ensure that education, medical, mental health and security \nactivities are considered. The juvenile shall be encouraged to attend and participate in the \ndiscussion. If a juvenile is not making progress, the treatment team shall discuss strategies \nfor addressing the impediments to progress and shall modify the treatment plan accordingly. \n56. Any decision that results in an extension of time a juvenile must spend in a short term \nprogram or results in removal from a short term program shall be personally reviewed by \nthe facility warden, deputy warden or assistant warden who shall review the relevant \ndocumentation prior to determining whether to approve the decision for the extension. \nNotice and reasons for the extension will be provided to the court of jurisdiction and the \njuvenile's last known attorney of record. \n57. Within 23 months of the effective date of this Agreement, the DPSC shall develop and \nimplement guidelines for the placement of juveniles in specialized behavior management \nunits and such guidelines shall take into account the medical and mental health status of \nthe juvenile, and shall provide, at a minimum: \na. For the criteria by which a juvenile can be initially transferred to such a unit, which shall \ninclude a hearing; \nb. For documentation of all reasonable less restrictive alternatives attempted before the \ndecision was made to place a juvenile in such a unit, unless the severity of the offense \nindicates otherwise; \nc. For the development of a written, individualized and detailed program plan that shall set \nforth measurable short-term goals and concrete criteria for the juvenile's removal from the \nunit and be provided to the juvenile. The State shall attempt to complete the program plan \nwithin 72 hours of placement, exclusive of weekends and holidays; \n\n \nd. Appropriate programming for special needs juveniles placed in these units; \ne. That the warden of a facility approve the decision to transfer a juvenile to such a unit. \nWhere such assignment results in a transfer to a different facility, it must be approved by \nboth wardens, where applicable, or by the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Youth \nDevelopment if the wardens do not agree. \nf. DPSC shall provide to the Provider a list of juveniles transferred to a specialized behavior \nunit. \nD. Access to Courts \n58. The State shall establish and implement policies and procedures to assure that: \na. juveniles have meaningful access to telephones for privileged communications with their \nattorneys. \nb. juveniles have meaningful and confidential attorney-client communications through the \nmail. No privileged mail shall be opened except by the intended recipient except that \ncorrespondence may be opened for contraband if it is opened in the presence of the \njuvenile. \nc. The State shall provide adequate paper, pens/pencils, envelopes and postage to indigent \njuveniles for legal communications. \nd. A juvenile's right to confidential communications with attorneys is protected. \n59. Within four months of the effective date of this Agreement, the State shall fund three \nnew staff attorney positions 960*960 and three new paralegal positions for the Louisiana \nIndigent Defense Assistance Board, which positions shall be dedicated to representing \njuveniles in secure custody in connection with appeals of their adjudications and \nmodifications of their disposition. These attorneys and paralegals may also assist juveniles \nin secure facilities by referring those juveniles to other attorneys for possible representation \nin pursuing claims arising out of their conditions of confinement. \n60. The State shall cooperate with attorneys representing juveniles in secure facilities in \nmaking those juveniles' institutional records available in connection with any appeal or \nmodification of their dispositions. \nE. Chemical Agents \n61. Upon execution of this Agreement, the only chemical agent that may be kept or used \nshall be 100% OC spray. Only the Warden, Deputy Warden or Assistant Warden, or when \nthey are not present at the facility, the highest ranking officer at the facility, shall be \npermitted to authorize the use of the spray. The authorizing Warden or officer must be \npresent at the use of the spray. They may not delegate this authority to any other person. \nOnly employees specifically trained in the use of chemical spray shall be permitted to use \nthe spray. The chemical spray shall not be intentionally sprayed in the face of any juvenile. \n\n \nEmployees shall be trained to not intentionally spray juveniles in the face. The State shall \nensure that the Warden, Deputy Warden or Assistant Wardens are trained in the correct \nuse of these sprays to prevent excessive exposure, the hazards associated with such \nsprays, and the first aid response to exposure situations. Within two months of the effective \ndate of the Agreement, all use of chemical agents shall be videotaped, with sound \nrecording, and the tape of the incident shall be maintained for the duration of this \nAgreement for inspection by the Plaintiffs, the DOJ, and the Court Expert. The State shall \nensure that the chemical spray is only used under the following terms: \na. Chemical agents shall not be used except under the conditions set forth below and with \nprior approval, after personal observation of the situation, from the Warden, Deputy Warden \nor Assistant Warden if one of these officials is at the facility. If the Warden, Deputy or \nAssistant Warden is not at the facility, prior approval may be given, after personal \nobservation of the situation, by the highest ranking security officer on duty at the facility. \nHowever, such approval shall not be required in the case of a large-scale disturbance (such \nas an attempted mass escape) that poses an imminent danger to the public, staff or other \njuveniles, so long as in such an event the Warden, Deputy or Assistant Warden is notified \nas soon as practicable; \nb. Chemical agents shall not be carried on the person of any individual. Chemical agents \nshall not be stored in any cellblock or living area, but shall be securely stored in a separate \nlocation. Chemical agents shall not be removed from this secure storage area unless (1) for \nuse in staff training (2) for product disposal or (3) as authorized pursuant to subsection (a) \nin response to a situation described in subsection (c), provided however that the authorizing \nofficial need not make a personal observation of the situation prior to authorizing the \nremoval of the chemical agents from the secure area. \nc. Chemical agents shall only be authorized when: \ni. A juvenile is posing a direct and immediate threat of injury to staff or another juvenile; \nii. The juvenile is creating a sustained disturbance that jeopardizes 961*961 the effective \nmonitoring and supervision of the unit to the extent that the safety of juveniles or staff is \nendangered, which persists despite efforts to de-escalate without the use of chemical \nagents, and the use of chemical agents is the only means to avoid a physical confrontation \nthat would likely result in injury to juveniles or staff; or \niii. The use is necessary to prevent an escape. \nThe State shall ensure that exposed juveniles are seen by medical staff whenever spray is \nused. The State shall ensure that juveniles with known chronic respiratory conditions \n(including asthma) are not subjected to chemical spray. However, this shall not prohibit the \nuse of chemical spray when it is necessary to prevent or quell a large scale disturbance \nwhere such juveniles are present. In no event shall staff use a chemical spray as \npunishment, discipline, retaliation, for the purpose of inflicting pain, for staff's convenience, \nor after handcuffs have been applied. \n62. Every usage of chemical spray shall be documented in a chemical agent report and \nevery removal shall be documented in a log maintained for this purpose. The chemical \nagent report shall describe the behavior of the juvenile with sufficient particularity to enable \n\n \na reviewer to determine independently whether the above requirements of ¶ 61 have been \ncomplied with (i.e., the documentation shall not simply restate, paraphrase or refer to the \nabove conditions warranting use of chemical spray). \n63. A copy of the Accident and Injury Report (\"A & I\") and UOR shall be placed in the file of \nthe juvenile against whom the chemical restraint was used. \nF. Mechanical Restraints \n64. Within two months of the effective date of this Agreement, the State shall not use \nmechanical restraints except under the following circumstances. The use of mechanical \nrestraints shall be limited to the minimum period of time necessary to enable the juvenile to \ngain control of his behavior. When a handcuff belt is not used, handcuffs shall be applied \nbehind the back in a manner to minimize the risk of injury to the juvenile and the staff \nperson responsible for supervising the juvenile. \nThe State shall not use mechanical restraints except under the conditions set forth below: \na. For transportation of juveniles outside the facility, the State may use handcuffs, leg irons, \nand/or handcuff belts; \nb. For movement of juveniles within the facility, no mechanical restraints shall be used \nexcept under the following conditions. Handcuffs and/or a handcuff belt may be used if the \nfacility has documented that the juvenile poses a current escape risk or has engaged in a \nrecent pattern of assaultive behavior toward staff or other juveniles, as determined and \nauthorized by a ranking security shift supervisor. Leg irons may only be used for \ntransportation within the facility if the conditions of subparagraph (d) are met; \nc. For movement of juveniles within the facility to transport a juvenile from general \npopulation to a restrictive housing area after a fight or other serious incident, handcuffs \nand/or a handcuff belt may be used; \nd. For control of a juvenile who, after less restrictive measures have not been successful, \ncontinues to engage in aggressive or assaultive behavior that is a clear and present danger \nto the juvenile, another juvenile, staff, or the security of the facility, a handcuff belt, and/or \nleg irons may be used. In this instance, such use of mechanical restraints shall require \ncontinuous 962*962 one-on-one physical supervision and must be approved by the ranking \nsupervisor (Captain or higher) on duty at the facility. The staff person shall ensure that the \nphysical needs of the juvenile are met promptly; \ne. For intra-facility movement of juveniles in administrative segregation for disciplinary \nreasons, handcuffs and/or a handcuff belt, may be used. \nAlthough a routine medical examination after the use of mechanical restraint is not required, \nimmediate medical treatment shall be provided if there is a visual indication of an injury or if \nthe juvenile identifies a specific medical complaint. \n\n \nNo other forms of mechanical restraints may be used (including 4 or 5 point restraints and \nthe handcuff \"blackbox\"). This, however, does not apply to medical or mental health \nrestraints ordered by a medical or mental health professional. \n65. Every use of a mechanical restraint, other than as authorized under ¶ 64(a) and (e), \nshall be documented. The use of mechanical restraints shall be documented on a UOR or in \na log maintained for this purpose. Documentation to reflect compliance with ¶ 64 shall \ndescribe the behavior of the juvenile with sufficient particularity to enable a reviewer to \ndetermine independently whether the above requirements of ¶ 64 have been complied with \n(i.e., the documentation shall not simply restate, paraphrase or refer to the above conditions \nwarranting use of mechanical restraints). \n66. The State shall promulgate a policy setting forth which staff are permitted to carry \nmechanical restraints and where all other mechanical restraints are to be stored. \n67. Every facility shall maintain inventory log books for all mechanical restraints. One log \nbook shall be kept at each location where mechanical restraints are stored. The log book \nshall contain the following information for mechanical restraint devices in the facility: \na. A unique identifying number recorded in the log book and on the device (such as a serial \nnumber); \nb. For every time the device is removed from its storage location: \ni. The date and time of its removal; \nii. The name of the person removing the device; \niii. The name of the person authorizing its removal and a brief statement of the reason (e.g., \ntransportation outside the facility); \niv. The date and time the device was returned; and \nv. A statement of whether the mechanical restraint was used while the device was checked \nout. \nG. Living Conditions \n68. The State shall establish and implement policies and procedures assuring adequate \nsanitation in the kitchen and eating areas, as well as all living areas. Such policies and \nprocedures shall include: \na. The provision of cleaning supplies on a daily basis in order that the living and sleeping \nareas may be cleaned; \nb. Regular, daily cleaning of the shower and toilet area of each dormitory and cellblock; \nc. Thorough daily cleaning, using accepted institutional methods, of the kitchen and eating \nareas. \n\n \n69. Within twelve months of the effective date of this Agreement, female staff shall not \nregularly or routinely view male juveniles toileting or showering and male staff shall not \nregularly or routinely view female juveniles toileting or showering unless the affected shower \nand toilet areas screen the genital areas of juveniles showering and using the toilet. \n70. The State shall provide adequate personal hygiene items to juveniles, including 963*963 \nsufficient soap, shampoo, hair brushes or combs, toothbrushes, toothpaste and deodorant \nfor daily hygiene needs. \n71. The State shall establish and implement policies and procedures assuring that each \njuvenile has sufficient and appropriately cleaned clothing. \n72. The State shall make best efforts to insure that all living units at SCCY-M are climate \ncontrolled by October 31, 2000, and will give notice with an explanation if the project is not \ncompleted on time. \n73. Upon the effective date of the Agreement, the State shall provide for at least one hour of \noutdoor exercise, weather permitting, including weekends and holidays to each juvenile \nexcept when: \na. contra-indicated for medical reasons; or \nb. a juvenile in administrative segregation continues to present an immediate danger to \nothers. Utilization of provision (b) shall require the approval of the Warden/Deputy Warden, \nor Assistant Warden. In the absence of the Warden/Deputy Warden or Assistant Warden, \napplication of provision (b) may be authorized only by the highest ranking officer at the \ninstitution. \nWithin 12 months of the effective date of this Agreement, each facility shall provide \nadequate recreational equipment and activities adapted for special needs juveniles. \nEach facility shall provide adequate recreational equipment. Adequate indoor recreational \nopportunities shall be provided in the event of inclement weather. \nThe State shall maintain information in logbooks in dormitories, cellblocks, school and the \ninfirmary to record outdoor exercise activities. \nH. Cell Restriction \n74. Locking a juvenile in a room for prolonged periods of time, except during sleeping hours \n(cell restriction), shall occur only in three contexts — administrative segregation, protective \ncustody, and removal from regular programming. Use of cell restriction in these contexts \nshall be governed by the requirements set forth below, provided, however, that all staff \ntraining to fully implement parts (a)(iv), (a)(ix), and c(v), may not be completed until 23 \nmonths after the effective date of this Agreement. \na. Administrative Segregation \n\n \ni. Juveniles can be placed in the administrative segregation unit only when their continued \npresence in general population poses a threat to the safety of the juvenile, staff or other \njuveniles or is a substantial threat to the security of the institution. This includes activities \nthat are destabilizing or highly disruptive to programming. \nii. Juveniles living in dormitories may only be placed in administrative segregation pending a \nhearing on their disciplinary charge. Juveniles engaging in suicidal or self-mutilating \nbehavior shall not be held in administrative segregation for behaviors resulting from their \nconditions. \niii. The State shall ensure that only a staff member of the rank of Lieutenant or higher places \na juvenile in administrative segregation. The staff placing a juvenile in administrative \nsegregation shall obtain the approval of the Warden or the Warden's designee as soon as \npossible. \niv. Staff shall make visual contact with each juvenile in administrative segregation at least \nevery 15 minutes (or more, depending upon the juvenile's emotional state) and otherwise \nmonitor the condition of each juvenile. Staff shall record essential information about each \njuvenile in administrative segregation. Staff shall alert mental health staff if a juvenile begins \nto exhibit symptoms 964*964 of a deterioration in emotional state while in cell restriction in \naccordance with the guidelines set forth in subparagraph 74(a)(ix). \nv. For juveniles held in administrative segregation, disciplinary hearings shall be held every \nday. A juvenile's disciplinary hearing shall be held within 24 hours or at the first scheduled \nhearing after the disciplinary writeup. Juveniles may not be subjected to cell restriction as a \npenalty resulting from a disciplinary hearing. \nvi. Juveniles in administrative segregation may be held in cell restriction until calm. Staff \nshall make all efforts to assist juveniles in administrative segregation to regain control of \ntheir behavior. If the juvenile is calm but the security shift supervisor believes that the \njuvenile will likely be disruptive in programming, he may be excluded from programming. If a \njuvenile's stay in administrative segregation exceeds 24 hours due to the investigation of a \nserious incident, the juvenile will be permitted to participate in the 7½ hour programming \nschedule unless he is a danger to others. The daily time out of cells shall not be contingent \nupon any planned or scheduled programming available to the juvenile. \nvii. Programming for juveniles in administrative segregation may only be ended if the \njuvenile engages in the behaviors listed in subparagraph 74(c)(iii). \nviii. A juvenile in administrative segregation shall be routinely provided with reading and \nwriting materials unless his current behavior indicates that possession of such materials \nwould be a danger to the health of the juvenile or others. \nix. Juveniles with mental retardation or serious mental illness shall be assessed and \ntreatment rendered if clinically indicated within three hours of being placed in administrative \nsegregation (if the juvenile remains in administrative segregation). The assessment shall be \nconducted by a licensed qualified mental health professional (\"QMHP\") on-call, on-site at \nthe facility. \nAfter regular business hours, weekends, and holidays, the on-site nurse will be notified \nimmediately, who will perform the assessment and contact the on-call QMHP via telephone. \n\n \nIf indicated, the on-call QMHP will go the facility for a face-to-face assessment and, if \ndeemed indicated by the QMHP, confer with the psychiatrist on-call. \nBased upon the assessment, clinically indicated treatment will be rendered. On-call nurses \nwill be trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness. In situations when a \njuvenile is determined to be seriously mentally ill, and a danger to self or others, the juvenile \nwill be placed in a \"crisis\" bed designated at each facility. Admission to and discharge from \ncrisis beds are by physician orders only. Respite beds will also be designated for those \njuveniles in need of immediate supervision and intervention secondary to serious mental \nhealth needs, although not a level of danger to self or others. Admission to and discharge \nfrom respite beds are by physician orders only. In these situations for mentally retarded \njuveniles and seriously mentally ill juveniles, the mental health treatment team will revise \nand/or develop a treatment plan, if needed. The treatment plan will consist of written \nstatements which specify a particular course of therapeutic interventions and the roles of \nthe qualified health care personnel. \nCrisis and respite beds will be established at each of the juvenile institutions 965*965 within \n23 months of the effective date of this Agreement. \nb. Protective Custody \ni. Juveniles in protective custody shall be visited at least once each day by a mental health \nprofessional and shall be clinically assessed and treated as deemed appropriate. On \nweekends, these functions may be performed by a registered nurse with mental health \ntraining. \nii. Juveniles in protective custody shall be permitted to be out of their cells for at least nine \nhours a day and participate in programming (including recreation) each day. \niii. Programming for juveniles in protective custody may only be ended if the juvenile \nengages in the behaviors listed in ¶ 74(c)(iii). \niv. Protective custody shall be used as a temporary housing measure in order to allow \ninvestigation and/or counseling to determine the factors which resulted in a juvenile's \nplacement in protective custody and shall end when a safe and appropriate housing \nassignment is available. \nc. Removal from Regular Programming \ni. The State may not assign a juvenile to cellblock housing without a hearing. \nii. A juvenile who is housed in a cellblock may be removed from programming and placed in \nhis assigned cell only in accordance with ¶ 74(c)(iii) and shall have opportunities to rejoin \nprogramming in accordance with ¶ 74(c)(iv). For juveniles who have not been removed from \nprogramming in accordance with ¶ 74(c)(iii) the daily time out of cells shall be a minimum of \n9 hours and shall occur regardless of whether there is any planned or scheduled \nprogramming available to the juvenile. \niii. Program participation may be ended only if the juvenile engages in: \na) Repeated failure to follow orders, where the failure to comply is destabilizing; \n\n \nb) Repeated interference with staff or other juveniles' duties; \nc) Improper sexual behaviors; \nd) Fighting; \ne) Substantial destruction of property; or \nf) Violent conduct that creates an imminent danger to other juveniles or staff. \nThe decision to remove a juvenile from programming shall be approved by a ranking \nsecurity staff member Lieutenant or higher and documented in a log. \niv. If a juvenile is removed from programming before noon, the juvenile shall be evaluated \nby a ranking security shift supervisor before evening recreation to determine whether the \njuvenile can be permitted to participate in evening recreation. The juvenile shall be \npermitted to participate in evening recreation unless the ranking security shift supervisor \ndetermines that, based on documented interim behavior, the juvenile is likely to engage in \nconduct described in ¶ 74(c)(iii) and documents the basis for his belief in a log maintained \nfor this purpose; provided, however, that every juvenile shall be permitted an opportunity to \nparticipate in programming at the beginning of each day. \nv. Juveniles with mental retardation or serious mental illness and who are assigned to a \ncellblock, who have been removed from regular programming shall be assessed and \ntreated, when deemed clinically appropriate, as soon as possible after they have been \ndenied the opportunity to participate in three consecutive 966*966 opportunities for \nprogramming. For example, a juvenile who is not permitted to participate in afternoon, \nevening, and the following morning's programming shall be reviewed as soon as possible \nfollowing the denial of the juvenile's opportunity to participate in the morning programming. \nSuch review shall be in accordance with the protocols established in ¶ 74(a)(ix). \nSubsequent to such review and assessment, a licensed QMHP may recommend release of \nthe juvenile from cell restriction to a respite bed or another location if the juvenile is not \ncurrently a danger to others. \n75. Within three months of the effective of this Agreement, when a juvenile is placed on cell \nrestriction pending a disciplinary hearing, a copy of the disciplinary report reflecting this \naction will be placed into the juvenile's file. \nIV. MEDICAL, DENTAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH \n76. To assist the State in achieving compliance with the terms of this Agreement, effective \nJuly 1, 2000, the State shall enter into a three-year contractual relationship with Provider. \nThe Provider shall be agreed to by all parties. During the first year of the three-year \ncontract, the Provider will begin to furnish during the first year, medical, mental health, and \ndental services for JCCY and JRDC, and quality assurance and monitoring services for the \nother secure juvenile facilities operated in Louisiana. Provider shall also furnish adolescent \nbehavioral and mental health training throughout Louisiana's secure juvenile system, \nbeginning in year two.

Provider \n\n \nshall provide comprehensive medical, mental health, and dental services at all of \nLouisiana's secure juvenile facilities by the end of the second year of the three-year \ncontract. The contract shall be subject to cancellation within the three-year term only if the \nLegislature fails to approve the necessary funding. \n77. The DPSC, acting with and through the Provider, shall develop policies and procedures \naddressing access to, and delivery of, medical, mental health, and dental services for the \njuveniles confined in the secure juvenile facilities. These policies and procedures shall meet \nthe standards and requirements of Provider and the terms of this Agreement. \n78. The DPSC, acting with and through the Provider, shall assume responsibility for the \nadministration of the delivery of medical, mental health, and dental services at JCCY and \nJRDC during the first year of the contract. These services shall be provided generally in \ncompliance with the proposal set forth in Attachment A. \n79. During year one of the contract, the parties agree that Attachment B would result in \nmedical, mental health, and dental staffing which is adequate for JCCY and JRDC. The \nparties recognize that Attachment B was designed to reflect a phase-in partial year staffing \npattern. If the Provider deviates from Attachment B, the State must nonetheless provide \nmedical, mental health, and dental staffing which is adequate. \nThe parties agree that Attachment C would result in medical, mental health, and dental \nstaffing which is adequate for JCCY and JRDC. If the Provider deviates from Attachment C, \nthe State must nonetheless provide medical, mental health, and dental staffing which is \nadequate. \nIn year one, the current level of medical, mental health and dental services at BCCY, \nSCCY, and SCCY-M shall not be reduced. \n80. Provider shall develop and implement a quality assurance program throughout \nLouisiana's juvenile facilities which shall comply with the terms of this Agreement. Provider \nshall develop and implement 967*967 a quality assurance program that shall continuously \nevaluate the medical, mental health, and dental services programs at all the facilities, \nidentify problems, make recommendations for corrective action and, in collaboration with \nDPSC, determine whether the recommendations have been followed. The program should \ninclude but not be limited to establishment of standards, monitoring of performance, and \nanalysis of deficits. The quality assurance program shall use data provided by DPSC and \nother sources and shall be based on random sampling. All of the functions will be \ncommenced at all secure juvenile facilities by the beginning of year two of the three year \ncontract.

The parties agree that Attachment D, E, and F would result in medical, mental \nhealth, and dental care which is adequate for JCCY and JRDC. If the Provider deviates \nfrom Attachment D, E, or F, the State must nonetheless provide medical, mental health, and \ndental care which is adequate. \n82. The Provider shall plan and implement a system-wide program to supplement the \ntraining of all DPSC staff who have direct contact with juveniles, including correctional staff \nand counselors. The training shall include instruction in adolescent behavior and in \nidentification and response to mental illness and mental retardation. The parties agree that \nAttachment G would result in training which is adequate. If the Provider deviates from \nAttachment G, the State must nonetheless provide training in adolescent behavior and in \nidentification and response to mental illness and mental retardation which is adequate and \nthe State shall notify Plaintiffs and the DOJ of all such deviations. Provider shall also \nsupplement the training of all facility investigators concerning investigatory 968*968 \ntechniques used in child abuse investigations. \n83. By August 1, 2001, Provider shall provide adequate medical, dental, and mental health \nprofessionals and staff in order to comply with all relevant State and Federal laws and \nregulations for the juvenile population of JCCY and the intake operations of JRDC. By July \n1, 2002, Provider shall provide adequate medical, dental, and mental health professionals \n\n \nand staff in order to comply with all relevant state and federal laws and regulations for the \njuvenile population of all other juvenile facilities. \n84.

The State shall either remove any hazards identified by Provider within one month \nafter the inspection or provide written reasons why the hazards will not be removed. Copies \nof the reasons shall be provided to the Court Expert and Plaintiffs, along with a description \nof alternative safety precautions that DPSC will make, if any. \n85. Juveniles identified with serious medical needs shall be transferred to JCCY as soon as \npossible, unless security concerns prevent such a transfer. Juveniles with serious mental \nillnesses shall be transferred to either SCCY or JCCY as soon as possible, unless security \nconcerns prevent such a transfer. DPSC will provide Provider with information on juveniles \nwho have been prescribed more than one psychotropic medication or who have chronic \nmedical conditions. \n86. During year one at JCCY and JRDC only and in ensuing years at all facilities, decisions \nregarding the medical, mental health, and dental care of a juvenile shall be made by \nProvider. If DPSC determines that a decision by Provider cannot be implemented, DPSC \nshall provide the reason in writing to Provider, the Court Expert, DOJ, and the Plaintiffs. \n87. Provider shall screen and assess all juveniles at intake and make recommendations \nconcerning the needs of each juvenile to be met by the juvenile's individualized intervention \nplan. DPSC shall develop an individualized intervention plan based, among other things, on \nProvider's recommendations. Provider's recommendations shall also be provided to the \nState Director of Education if the assessment includes indicators for a possible special \neducation placement. \n88. Based on the outcomes of the screenings and assessments discussed above, within \nthirty days of intake, Provider shall develop a specific, individualized, goal and outcome-\noriented mental health treatment plan for all seriously mentally ill juveniles. Provider shall \nbegin implementation of the treatment plans for these juveniles at JCCY by the end of year \none and, in ensuing years, at the other secure facilities. The plan shall address all \npsychiatric and psychological needs of the juvenile and shall include competency-based \ntreatment goals and objectives. The juvenile's family shall be given the opportunity and shall \nbe encouraged to be involved in the treatment, unless the facility documents with \nparticularity why such participation is likely to be harmful to the juvenile. Individual behavior \ntreatment plans shall be developed and implemented, where the Provider deems it \nappropriate. The treatment team responsible for implementing the treatment plans shall \nmeet at least every 90 days to assess the efficacy of the plan and make revisions where \nindicated. \nJuveniles removed from school for medical, dental or mental health consultations, \nexaminations or appointments shall be exempt on that day from the provisions of the \neducation settlement regarding specific academic and vocational 969*969 program \nparticipation when applicable. \n\n \n89.

Medical/mental health restraints shall not be used unless specifically ordered by a \nphysician or psychiatrist. Soft or leather restraints, rather than metal mechanical restraints, \nshall be utilized for this purpose. There shall be no standing orders for medical/mental \nhealth restraints. This does not apply to any order by a physician or psychiatrist that is \nissued in response to an individual juvenile's current medical or mental health condition. \nMedical/mental health restraints shall be used only in the infirmary under constant \nsupervision and conducted according to current accepted professional standards on \nmedical restraints. \n92. Suicide watch shall only be conducted with adequate staff supervision. The infirmary will \nbe used on a priority basis for suicide watch unless the medical needs of another juvenile \ntake priority as determined by a physician. The second priority will be individual rooms that \nare suicide resistant and are equipped with video surveillance cameras. In the event there is \na need for additional beds, these will be jointly identified by DPSC and the Provider. \n93. Provider shall make best efforts to hire board eligible or board certified child and \nadolescent psychiatrists to fill psychiatric staffing positions. In the event that board certified \nand board eligible child and adolescent psychiatrists cannot be found, psychiatrists with \nadolescent experience shall be hired, whenever possible. These psychiatrists shall be \nsupervised by board certified or board eligible child and adolescent psychiatrists. \n94. Within 3 months of the effective date of this Agreement, DPSC and Provider shall \ndevelop and implement procedures for reporting to the Warden and to the Youth Programs \nCompliance Division any problems with abuse or neglect that they uncover during their \nduties. Provider staff shall comply with their obligations as mandatory reporters of child \nabuse as discussed in ¶ 22 of this Agreement. \n95.

Juveniles at JRDC who are scheduled for placement in boot camp will be identified to \nProvider and Provider shall make recommendations to DPSC on the juvenile's suitability for \nthis program, with reference to any physical and mental limitations of the juvenile. DPSC \nshall implement the recommendations or if they cannot implement the recommendations, \nDPSC has an affirmative obligation to return to the Court having jurisdiction over the \n\n \njuvenile to inform the Court and the juvenile's last known counsel of record that DPSC \ncannot implement the recommendations. \n97. For all juveniles who are receiving services from Provider and who are being released, \nProvider shall provide aftercare planning relevant to the services provided to that juvenile by \nProvider. This planning will be provided during 970*970 year one at JCCY and JRDC only \nand in ensuing years at all facilities. \n98. By the end of year one at JCCY and JRDC only and by the end of year two at all \nfacilities, Provider's nursing staff shall perform daily sick call in all high security housing \nunits. Provider shall ensure that access to medical care shall not be within the decision-\nmaking authority of correctional staff. \n99.

Provider shall provide an assessment and timely treatment, when they deem it \nappropriate, to juveniles who have been identified to Provider as having recently \nexperienced significant trauma either by being sexually exploited by other juveniles or staff \nor by having physical confrontations with other juveniles or staff. DPSC will provide \ninformation as agreed upon with Provider to identify juveniles who may have suffered such \ntrauma. \n102. Provider shall develop a crisis bed and a respite bed at each facility in accordance with \nProvider's facilities plan at JCCY and JRDC and by the end of year two of the three-year \ncontract at all other secure juvenile facilities. \n103. By year three, the training provided by Provider will include training for those identified \nstaff who issue disciplinary reports and/or who participate in disciplinary courts and who, \ntherefore, should be trained to make reasonable accommodations for the needs of juveniles \nwith serious mental illness and mental retardation. \n104. Correctional staff — and not medical staff of either the Provider or DPSC (including \nEMT's) — will actually initiate and prepare any disciplinary report for malingering. No \njuvenile will be disciplined or written up for malingering based on the juvenile's access to the \nmedical care system through emergency or regular sick call, regularly scheduled clinics or \nphysicians' clinics until after the physician has evaluated the patient and determined that the \njuvenile's complaint or complaints had little or no merit. DPSC's DISCIPLINARY RULES \nAND PROCEDURES FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS, First Edition, 1993 shall be revised to \nbe consistent with this provision. \n105. Juveniles shall not receive disciplinary reports for refusing to take mental health tests \nor for refusing to take psychotropic medications. \n\n \n106. The State shall not discipline juveniles for suicidal behaviors. The State shall not \ndiscipline juveniles for self-mutilating behaviors, where those behaviors result from a mental \nhealth disorder, mental illness or anxiety or fear over the juvenile's safety. No juvenile shall \nbe disciplined for self-mutilation unless a psychiatrist or psychologist diagnoses malingering \nbased on reasons other than anxiety or fear over the juvenile's safety. In this context, self-\nmutilation does not include tattooing, body piercing, or similar conduct. Obvious self-\nmutilations will not result in disciplinary writeups. \n107. The State shall ensure that each living unit has a Hoffman 911 tool and that all staff \nare trained on its location and use. \n108. Juveniles shall have a written release plan except in cases where release cannot be \nreasonably anticipated. The plan must address living arrangements, work or school plans, \nother needs relevant to the juvenile, and where applicable, follow-up care for medical or \nmental health needs. \n109. Based on the outcomes of the screenings and assessments discussed above or other \nlegitimate sources, juveniles 971*971 with the highest need for substance abuse treatment \nshall either be scheduled for assignment to a therapeutic environment or other stand-alone \nor integrated program designed for substance abuse counseling and treatment. All \nreasonable efforts shall be made to make assignments to these programs as soon as \npossible, once a juvenile is identified. Parents/legal guardians and family members shall be \ngiven the opportunity and shall be encouraged to be involved in the treatment, unless the \nfacility documents with particularity why such participation is likely to be harmful to the \njuvenile. All other juveniles shall be provided substance abuse education as part of their \nintervention plan. Substance abuse education and intervention programs shall be modified \nto accommodate the needs of juveniles with learning or developmental disabilities. \n110. Based on the screenings and assessments discussed above, the State shall develop \nand implement an individualized intervention plan for each juvenile that addresses areas \nsuch as education, life skills, medical, and other intervention needs of the juvenile. \nImplementation of the plan shall begin upon assignment of the juvenile following transfer \nfrom JRDC. Under normal circumstances and absent unusual testing or evaluation \nrequirements, transfer should occur by 30 days of intake. The individualized intervention \nplan shall include meaningful and specific short-term and long-term intervention goals. The \njuvenile's family shall be given the opportunity and shall be encouraged to be involved in the \nintervention plan, unless the facility documents with particularity why such participation is \nlikely to be harmful to the juvenile. The intervention team responsible for implementing the \nintervention plans shall meet at least every third month to assess the efficacy of the plan \nand make revisions where indicated. DPSC will ensure that counseling services are \nprovided, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of juveniles' individualized education plans. \n111. For each juvenile receiving psychotropic medications, direct care, counseling, and \neducational staff shall observe, monitor and record data that will be available to the \ntreatment team in order to assess the effect of a particular medication. A member of the \njuveniles's treatment team shall communicate with direct care, counseling, and educational \nstaff, and make efforts to communicate with families to review treatment and intervention \n\n \nprogress and data collected by staff to assess the efficacy of treatment and intervention, so \nthat the mental health providers can make revisions when clinically indicated. \n112. Case managers shall be notified of disciplinary infractions, problem behaviors \n(including being removed from programming three consecutive times), and incidents of \nviolence involving juveniles on their respective caseloads. The case managers shall utilize \nthis information to implement appropriate interventions, to determine that underlying causes \nof behavioral problems are being addressed in counseling, and/or to make referrals to the \nProvider. \n113. Each facility shall develop and implement an adequate intervention program which \nshall be determined by the needs of individual juveniles. The intervention program shall \nprovide counseling and programming as needed as recommended by the treatment team. \nCounseling may be provided by qualified staff with appropriate background and training. \n114. Each facility shall create and maintain daily schedules in each assigned housing unit or \nspecial program (such as STOP, LITE, etc.) that shall set forth the planned program and \noperational activities for all juveniles in the assigned unit or program for every hour of every \nday of the week. Such schedules will include time for permissible leisure activities. Shift \nsupervisors shall document 972*972 on a UOR the cancellation of any major activity \nscheduled for that shift. \n115. As part of the treatment and intervention plan of each juvenile, the State shall \nencourage family reunification where reunification is appropriate. Each juvenile shall have: \na. An opportunity to make telephone calls to his or her home as arranged by the juvenile's \ncase worker at State expense when the juvenile's case worker determines that the call \npromotes the goals of the juvenile's intervention plan. These calls are in addition to the \njuvenile's opportunities to make collect telephone calls on a daily basis. \nb. Access to adequate paper, pen or pencil and envelopes for three letters a week to \ncorrespond with their family. Indigent juveniles will be provided postage and other juveniles \nmay purchase stamps in the canteen. Staff will encourage juveniles to write to their parents, \nguardians, and families where appropriate; \nc. Visitation opportunities available a minimum of three times a month for a minimum of \nthree hours each visit. Each facility shall advise parents and/or guardians that special visits \nmay be approved by the Warden on a case-by-case basis for those who are not able to visit \non regular visiting days. Visitation shall not be suspended as a disciplinary sanction unless \nthe disciplinary infraction occurred during a visit. When appropriate, mental health staff shall \ntake advantage of times before or after visits by families to meet to discuss juveniles' mental \nhealth histories. \nJuveniles approved for special visits shall be exempt on that day from the provisions of the \neducation settlement regarding specific academic and vocational program participation \nwhen applicable. \n\n \n116. Initial institutional assignment will be driven by such factors as the needs of the \njuvenile, location of the program(s) beneficial to the juvenile, location of the juvenile's home, \navailability of space, gender, gang affiliation and other factors. \nV. QUALITY ASSURANCE \n117. The State shall create a Youth Programs Compliance Division (YPCD). The State shall \nrecruit and hire a Director of the YPCD, who shall be highly qualified for the position.

Within four months of the effective date of this Agreement, the State shall appoint two \nindependent auditors, acceptable to all parties, to perform quality assurance checks on \ninvestigations. If the parties are unable to agree on the selection of auditors, then the \nparties shall solicit the participation of the Court in selecting the auditors from among the \ncandidates proposed by the parties. The cost of the auditors shall be shared equally (50/50) \nby the DPSC and the DOJ. \na.

DOJ and Plaintiffs shall submit any comments on the Systems Proposal to \nthe State, in writing, not later than April 1, 2001. The parties shall meet promptly thereafter \nand attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding the Systems Proposal not later \nthan May 1, 2001. \na. If the parties agree on the substance of the Systems Proposal by May 1, 2001, then the \nDPSC shall request that funding for the first year of the Systems Proposal be included in the \n2001-2002 fiscal year executive budget. If funding for the first year of the Systems Proposal \nis not included in the final approved State budget as of July 1, 2001, then, on or before \nAugust 1, 2001, the Plaintiffs, acting collectively, and/or the DOJ may move to \nreopen/reactivate the medical/mental health and dental claims in the Lawsuits. \nb. If the DOJ or Plaintiffs do not accept the Systems Proposal, then, the Plaintiffs, acting \ncollectively, or the DOJ shall have the right to move to reopen/reactivate the Lawsuits for \nthe purpose of litigating the medical and mental health claims in the Lawsuits. If a motion to \nreopen/reactivate the Lawsuits is not filed on or before May 15, 2001, then the Systems \nProposal shall be deemed accepted and approved by all parties. \n124. Dr. Trupin, Dr. McPherson, and Dr. Peck shall serve as the Medical/Mental Health \nExperts under this Agreement. In the event that any one or more of these individuals is \nunable or unwilling to serve as a Medical/Mental Health Expert, then the Plaintiffs, DPSC \nand DOJ jointly shall select a pediatrician (or a physician who is not a pediatrician, if all \nparties agree), psychiatrist, and/or psychologist to replace that individual or those \nindividuals. If the parties are unable to agree on the selection of the replacement \nMedical/Mental Health Expert, then the DPSC and the DOJ shall each nominate a \nreplacement and shall solicit the participation of the Court in selecting the replacement from \nthe individuals nominated by the DOJ and DPSC. The reasonable fees and expenses of the \nMedical/Mental Health Experts shall be shared equally by the State and the DOJ. \n125.

The Training Director would be responsible for the \ndevelopment and implementation of the training program system-wide. During year one \ncurriculum development and on-site training at the Jetson Facility would occur. The system-\nwide implementation of the training of all new employees and on-site training at each \ninstitution would proceed beginning year two. \nATTACHMENT B \n\n \nYEAR ONE STAFFING \nLSU Health Sciences Center \nLSU School of Medicine in New Orleans \nJuvenile Justice Program—Jetson Facility and LSUHSC Administration \nProgram Year 1 \nFacility Year 1 \nMENTAL HEALTH STAFF                           FIE's \n      Psychiatrist MD Urban                    1.50 \n      Director of JDC                          0.80 \n      Assistant Director of JDC                0.75 \n      Neuropsychology Associate                0.90 \n      Psychologist PhD Urban                   2.40 \n      Psychological Asst Urban                 7.20 \n      Social Worker Urban                      4.50 \n      Secretary                                0.90 \n      Administrative Coordinator               0.90 \n      Program Evaluator                        0.90 \n      Dala Entry Clerks                        1.50 \n      Medical Records Clerk                    5.50 \n \n      Total                                   27.75 \n \nMEDICAL STAFF \n      Medical Director                         0.75 \n      Pediatrics/ Family Practice              1.05 \n987*987 \n      Consultants \n      Orthopedics                              0.05 \n      Surgery                                  0.05 \n      OB/GYN                                   0.20 \n      Neurology                                0.10 \n      Cardiology                               0.05 \n      Endocrinology                            0.03 \n      Dermatology                              0.05 \n      Dx Center misc                           1.30 \n      Secretary                                0.90 \n      Evaluation Coordinator                   0.90 \n \n      Total                                    5.40 \n \nNURSING STAFF \n      Nursing Coordinator                      0.90 \n      Registered Nurse                        12.75 \n      Licensed Practical Nurse                 9.00 \n \n      Total                                   21.75 \n\n \n \nALLIED HEALTH STAFF \n      Audiologist                              0.60 \n      Optometrist                              0.20 \n      XR tech                                  1.00 \n      Medical Record Clerks                    2.00 \n      PA/ NP                                   2.00 \n      Paramedic/ EMT                           2.70 \n \n      Total                                    9.50 \n \nDENTAL STAFF \n      Dentist                                  0.60 \n      Dental Assistant                         0.75 \n      Dental Hygienist                         0.60 \n \n      Total                                    2.10 \n \nProgram/Clinical Supervisors \n      Program Director                         0.80 \n      Director of Operations                   1.00 \n      Director—Medical Services \n      Director of Mental Health                0.50 \n      Director Social Work Services            1.00 \n      Director Program Development             0.75 \n      and Evaluation \n      Director Nursing Services                1.00 \n      Evaluation Coordinator                   1.80 \n      Executive Secretary                      1.80 \n      Secretary                                1.00 \n \n      Total                                    9.65 \n \nBUSINESS STAFF \n      Business Manager                         0.83 \n      Administrative Coordinator               0.90 \n      Assistant Bus.

Gordon, M.D. Chief, Department of Pediatrics Louisiana State \nUniversity Health Sciences Center Earl K. Long Medical Center Baton Rouge, Louisiana \nJune 22, 2000  \nGeneral Overview and Goals: \nThe overall plan of medical care for these offenders should include the following: \ncomprehensive health screening and health assessment by qualified professionals \n(physicians, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, paramedics, \nlicensed practical nurses) at intake, ongoing medical care of known conditions, annual \nexams to diagnose new conditions, access to an infirmary for evaluation of acute medical \nconditions, dental care, eye care, nutritional assessment, access to subspecialty care as \nindicated, access to hospitalization as indicated and access to emergency medical care. \nAdditionally, a plan for health education should be implemented for the offenders such that \nat the end of their stay they have a healthier lifestyle than prior to admission. Offenders with \nchronic medical conditions upon entering corrections will especially need ongoing education \nin regards to their disease and its management. The health education component must be a \ncooperative effort amongst medical, mental and correctional staff. Within one year of \nimplementation, system wide, the medical director of the program should readily be able to \nobserve a healthy environment— one in which youth have become active participants in \ntheir health care. It will be necessary to have an evaluative component (outcome based) for \nthe medical care and health education delivered in these facilities, such that we are able to \nprove our interventions are both efficient and effective. \nAccording to the \"Health Care of Incarcerated Youth Report from the 1991 Tri-Regional \nWorkshops,\" most of the offenders in juvenile correctional centers are generally healthy \nfrom a medical standpoint. Their mental health needs far outweigh their medical needs. The \nmedical conditions of offenders prior to incarceration commonly include polysubstance \nabuse, sexually transmitted diseases, trauma, physical and sexual abuse, short stature, \ndelayed puberty, poor dental health, poor immunization history, neuropsychiatry diagnoses \n(ADHD, depression, psychoses, personality disorders), allergies, asthma, seizure disorder \nand + PPD. The major health risk to offenders after incarceration tends to be trauma-\nrelated. \nBeing that Jetson (JCCY) is the point of entry for all offenders, performing all necessary \nscreenings, assessments, work-ups, diagnostics, etc. at this facility is prudent. The goal will \nbe for this initial evaluation to be thoroughly completed prior to transfer, highly decreasing \nthe need for duplication of services at the receiving facility. 989*989 The completed medical \nrecord ideally will provide all necessary information such that no old information (PMHx, \nimmunizations) will be missing. Reasonable and thorough efforts will be made during \ndiagnostics, such that the gathering of this information is as complete as possible prior to \ntransfer. It may be necessary for the offender's parent / guardian to deliver immunization \n\n \nrecords and/or their presence/availability during the intake/screening process. The parent / \nguardian presence could be accomplished via telephone, telehealth or in person. \nSystem Guidelines: \n1. JCCY will follow standards for the practice of medicine as set forth by the LSU Health \nSciences Center \n2. Where applicable, system wide relevant guidelines based upon referenced and agreed \nupon recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics will be developed and \ninclude, but not be limited to, the following: \na) Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care (Appendix 1)— specifically \nfocusing on those for 10-21 Years of age \nb) Guidelines for Health Supervision III (Appendix 2) \ni. Health Supervision: 10 & 11 Years \nii. Health Supervision: 12 & 13 Years \niii. Health Supervision: 14 & 15 Years \niv. Health Supervision: 16 & 17 Years \nv. Health Supervision: 18 & 19 Years \nvi. Health Supervision: 20 & 21 Years \ng) Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule (Appendix 3) \nh) Child's Guide to Pediatric Visits (Appendix 4 & 5) \ni. Younger Adolescents: 11 to 15 years old \nii. Older Adolescents: 16 to 21 years old \ni) AAP Policy Statement-Health Care for Children and Adolescents in Detention Centers, \nJails, Lock-Ups, and other Court-Sponsored Residential Facilities (RE9170) (Appendix 6) \nMedical Staffing of Facilities: \nAdministration: \n1. A statewide medical director will direct the medical component and this individual will be \nbased at JCCY. His duties will include implementation of policies and procedures developed \nby LSUHSC that relate solely to the provision of health services (see Administration Report, \nSection IV). The medical director will spend approximately half of his time in direct patient \ncare of offenders at JCCY and half of his time will be administrative, including regular site \nvisits to the other four facilities. \n\n \n2. Special protocols will be developed by the Medical and Mental Health Directors. Some of \nthese protocols will be developed jointly: \na. Suicide Prevention \nb. Acute Drug Intoxication and Withdrawal \nc. Perinatal Care \nd. Sexual Assault \ne. Alcohol or Chemical Dependency \nf. Family Planning Services \ng. Prosthesis and Aids for Living \n3. Written policy and procedure will be developed designating the health care authority \n(physician) on-site responsible for health care services. The designated physicians will \nsupervise all clinical judgements regarding health care, monitor appropriateness, timeliness, \nand responsiveness of care and treatment and review records for treatment of juveniles \nmade by providers in the community. \n4. Policy and procedure must be that clinical decisions and actions regarding health care \nservices are the sole responsibility 990*990 of the qualified medical health care \nprofessionals. \n5. Information sharing between the Warden and Medical Director will occur on a regular \nbasis in regards to offenders with significant medical or mental health needs. These \ndiscussions may include, but not be limited to, an offender's housing arrangements, \nprogram assignments, disciplinary measures, admissions or transfers to other facilities. \n6. At least quarterly administrative meetings between the Medical Director and the Warden \nwill be held. \n7. Monthly meetings between JCCY's medical director and the Warden will occur. \n8. A statistical report will be completed annually regarding the types of health care services \nprovided and their frequency. \n9. Health services meetings will occur monthly among clinical staff. \n10. There will be no less than 3 days per year of continuing education of all qualified health \ncare personnel (QHCP). Much of the ongoing education will be provided on-site and will not \nconflict with designated duties of the QHCP. \n11. A comprehensive quality improvement program will be developed to monitor the quality \nof health care services provided. There will be chart review by physicians or quality \nimprovement committee on a quarterly basis. \n\n \n12. All health care personnel will be licensed, registered, credentialed and function as per \nthe applicable laws of the State of Louisiana. \nOverview: \nStaffing: \nThe following staffing model for JCCY is recommended. The proposed model will provide \non-site physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners (or physician assistants) and paramedics \nspecific to the needs of JCCY. Access to quality medical care will be inherent to JCCY, \ndecreasing the need for transportation of offenders with security escorts to local hospitals. \nSick Call: \nSick call needs will be met by on-site access to medical services. Sick call will be conducted \nby RN's or paramedics. Offenders requiring additional assessment or treatment will be \ntriaged to a physician extender (nurse practitioner, physician assistant or paramedic). \nPhysician extenders will have 24 hour phone access to on call physicians. Emergent \nconditions will be appropriately transported to pre-arranged area hospitals. \nPhysician On-Call Schedule: \nA physician's on call schedule will provide for 24-hour access to one of the systems \ndesignated physicians. A system wide rotation will be implemented such that this call will be \n24 hours, 7 days per week. If necessary, the nurse will contact the physician on call. All \npatients admitted to the infirmary will be seen daily by a physician. \nSpecial Health Needs: \nOffenders with special health needs (serious or chronic) will preferably be housed at JCCY, \nSCCY and BCCCY as these facilities are in close proximity to LSUHSC hospitals. Special \narrangements will be made for offender's requiring higher levels of security than can be \nprovided at JCCY, SCCY or BCCCY. Programs will be developed for offenders with special \nhealth needs (i.e.—Diabetes, Asthma, Sickle Cell disease, Seizure Disorder, Obesity, HIV, \nTuberculosis, Alcohol or Chemical Dependency, Sexual Assault, Physical and Mental \nDisabilities). \nTelemedicine: \nThere will be a system wide effort to maximize the use of telemedicine when appropriate. \nTelemedical support will be provided for medical direction and consultation services when \nindicated on a 24-hour 7-day per week basis. (See Administration Report, Section VI). \n991*991 Graduate Medical Education: \n\n \nTraining of future medical personnel in the field of their choice is an important component of \nthe Juvenile Correctional Program. An accredited residency program in Pediatrics requires \ntraining in adolescent medicine. Involvement of pediatricians in training is both cost-effective \nand an ideal method of recruiting professionals to the field of juvenile correctional medicine. \nThis will further enhance the quality of the programs. Professional development tracks in the \nfield of Adolescent Medicine / Correctional Medicine will be developed. \nPharmaceutical: \nWritten policy and defined procedures require, and actual practice evidences, that \npharmaceutical services are sufficient to meet the needs of JCCY and are in accordance \nwith all legal requirements. Written policy and procedure governing pharmaceutical services \nwill be developed. Present pharmaceutical services for medical and mental health needs \nwill remain in place. \nJetson Correctional Center for Youth: \nThere are approximately 600 youth housed at JCCY. Of these, 104 offenders are in the \nDiagnostics Center (JRDC) in preparation for transfer to either JCCY or one of the other \nfour facilities. The remaining 496 offenders represent 322 males and all female offenders in \nthe system (174). They range in age from 10-21 years. Approximately 2000 new offenders \npass through JCCY per year for diagnostics and placement (40 per week). A thorough \nmedical evaluation will be performed and completed on every offender entering the \ncorrectional system. A plan of care will be developed for each offender before transfer to the \nreceiving facility. \nMedical Staffing Model: \n1. Correctional Expert Consultant \nDuring the implementation and development of the medical staffing model, it will be \nnecessary to retain the services of an expert in correctional medicine. He will be a \nconsultant to the Director of Adolescent Health Services for a period of one year. He will \nmake two site visits (3 days each) to JCCY (one before implementation and one during \nimplementation) and will spend two weeks assisting in development of system wide medical \nhealth policies and protocols. \n2. Medical Director \nThis physicians will be hired and appointed to the Department of Pediatrics at LSUHSC / \nEKL. Oversight of his duties will be provided by the Director of Adolescent Health Services. \nThe Medical Director for the System will be an Adolescent Medicine Trained Pediatrician. \n3. Jetson Diagnostic Center / Infirmary Physicians \n\n \nPediatricians with adolescent medicine experience will be hired and appointed to the \nLSUHSC / EKL Department of Pediatrics. They will be directly involved in the health \nassessment process of new offenders undergoing diagnostics at JCCY and provide health \nmaintenance of the offenders housed at JCCY. Physician medical coverage will be on-site \n40 hours per week. A call rotation will be developed such that 24-hour coverage is in place \n7 days per week. These physicians will also participate in the ongoing education of \noffenders and JCCY staff (nursing and corrections). Regularly scheduled continuity of care \nclinics will be established, but not be limited to, in the areas of General Pediatrics, Diabetes, \nAsthma / Allergy. \n4. Nurse Practitioners / Physician Assistants \nA Family Nurse Practitioner(FNP) will be assigned to the female unit to provide continuity of \ncare to all female offenders. She will conduct all initial gynecological exams during \ndiagnostics. Ongoing continuity of care will be provided on-site by this FNP. She will have \naccess to telemedical consultation with an obstetrician / gynecologist physician at Earl K. \nLong Medical 992*992 Center. She will conduct one half-day of gynecology clinic per week \nfor the ongoing gynecological needs of the offenders. The FNP will also participate in the \nongoing health education of the female offenders and correctional staff assigned to the \nfemale unit. \nAn additional nurse practitioner(NP) or physician's assistant(PA) will be assigned to the \nmale offenders. The NP / PA assigned to the male unit will provide patient care during the \nintake process (diagnostics) as well as continuity of care for the offenders housed at JCCY. \nAll NP's / PA's will work under the supervision of the physicians assigned to JCCY. \n5. Paramedics \nA paramedic will work from 7P-7A, 5 days per week and 24-hour shifts on weekends and \nholidays at JCCY to assess, diagnose and treat offenders in need of emergent care. They \nwill assess the need for transport to pre-arranged hospital emergency rooms or to the \ninfirmary. They will work closely with RN nursing staff under the guidance of the systems \nMedical Director. \n6. Consultants \nAudiologist \nAn audiologist will conduct a complete hearing evaluation on all offenders during the intake / \ndiagnostics process. The audiologist will conduct annual exams as necessary on all \noffenders housed at JCCY. The audiologist will be available telemedically to the other four \nfacilities for consultation. \nObstetrician/Gynecologist \n\n \nAn OB/GYN physician will provide telemedical coverage to the FNP as well as on-site care \nto the female offender population. All offenders with obstetrical needs will be referred to the \nEarl K. Long Woman's Clinic. \nOptometry \nAn Optometrist will provide baseline eye exams on all offenders during the intake process \nand ongoing optometry care to the youth housed at JCCY. \nPediatric Neurology \nPediatric Neurologists will be available on site for neurological consultation during the intake \n/ diagnostic process. They will also be available telemedically for follow-up through the \nLSUHSC-N.O. Pediatric Neurology epilepsy clinic. \nDermatology \nDermatology consultative services will be provided as needed telemedically through \nLSUHSC-N.O. \nOrthopedics \nOrthopedic Surgery residents from Earl K. Long Medical Center will provide on-site \nconsultative services during the intake / diagnostic process. They will also be available to \nconduct ongoing continuity of care to offenders with orthopedic conditions. Clinics \nconducted by residents will have telemedical access to orthopedic faculty physicians at Earl \nK. Long Medical Center. \nSurgery \nSurgical resident physicians from Earl K. Long Medical Center will provide on-site \nconsultative services during the intake / diagnostic process. They will be available to \nconduct ongoing continuity of care to offenders with surgical conditions. Clinics conducted \nby residents will have telemedical access to surgical faculty physicians at Earl K. Long \nMedical Center. \nPediatric Cardiology \nA pediatric cardiologist will be available telemedically from the Earl K. Long Pediatric Clinic \nto provide consultative services during the intake / diagnostic process and for ongoing \ncardiology consultations. \nPediatric Endocrinology \n\n \nA pediatric endocrinologist will be available telemedically from Children's Hospital to provide \nconsultative services during 993*993 the intake / diagnostic process and for ongoing \nendocrinology consultations. \n7. Pediatric Resident Education \nThe JCCY facility will provide an ideal environment for graduate medical education (GME) \nof pediatric and adolescent medicine specialist. Two rotations will be developed for \neducation of these physicians: \na) Adolescent / Behavioral Pediatrics Rotation \nb) General Pediatric Continuity of Care Clinic \nA general pediatric continuity of care clinic will be established at JCCY under the \nsupervision of the JCCY Medical Director and the Pediatric Residency Director at LSUHSC \n/ Earl K. Long. \n8. Evaluation Coordinator \nThis individual will be hired and appointed to the Department of Pediatrics at LSUHSC / \nEKLMC. The coordinator will publish outcome based evaluation components; evaluate \noffenders attitudes towards their medical health before, during and after incarceration; \nimplement positive changes through education in the areas of preventive medicine \nspecifically in the areas of high risk behaviors (HIV, STD's, HBV), obesity, heart disease, \netc. \nJCCY Medical Unit / Infirmary: \nOffenders will have the medical component of their intake conducted in the JCCY Medical \nUnit / Infirmary. The specifications for the equipment and medical needs are found in the \nbudget estimates. An exam room / clinic work area will need to be constructed for the \nfemale offenders in close proximity to their housing unit. This will be the primary working \nlocation of the Family Nurse Practitioner, the female offender's primary health care \nprofessional. \nOffenders with designated medical conditions that require ongoing medical care will be \nplaced in a single facility at JCCY (unless security restrictions dictate placement elsewhere) \nthat will be designated as the medical facility for the juvenile correctional system and will \nhave a capacity for up to 20 persons. Each of the designated beds below may be used for \nmultiple purposes. Renovation and/or new construction of the present infirmary will need to \noccur to accommodate the medical needs as follows: \n1. Designated beds for Female Offenders to include: \na) Intermediate Care / Respite beds \n\n \nb) Psychiatric Crisis beds \nc) Acute Substance Intoxication Withdrawal beds \nd) General Pediatric beds \ne) Medical Isolation beds \n2. Designated beds for Male Offenders to include: \na) Intermediate Care / Respite beds \nb) Psychiatric Crisis beds \nc) Acute Substance Intoxication Withdrawal beds \nd) General Pediatric beds \ne) Medical Isolation beds \nAll offenders admitted to the infirmary will be seen daily by a physician and within 24 hours \nof admission. Physician coverage by phone will be available 24 hours per day. Offenders \nrequiring potential emergency medical attention will be evaluated telemedically via the \nLSUHSC / Earl K. Long Medical Center Emergency Room. If necessary, transfer will occur. \nSome conditions that will necessitate being placed in this unit are: \n1. Asthma management—short term \n2. Diabetes management—short term \n3. Mild Dehydration—intravenous fluid capabilities \n5. Post Hospitalization completion of IV antibiotics \n6. Post Operative recovery period \n7. Observation area for other non-emergent medical conditions \n8. Acute Substance Intoxication Withdrawal (only treated at JCCY) \n9. Psychiatric Crisis (i.e.-Suicidal and Homicidal offenders) \n994*994 Nurse Staffing Needs: \nThere will be a Director of Nursing (DON) with adolescent and / or correctional medicine \nexperience. \nThere will be a designated RN in charge of the Quality Assurance program and Infection \nControl program. The QA and Infection Control Nurse will also be assigned clinical duties. \n\n \nFor staffing of the facility, an eight-hour shift model was used. There will always be at least \none RN with psychiatric experience on duty (24 hours per day) in all facilities. I used a factor \nof 1.7 nurses to staff an 8-hour shift. Being that nursing care will be the most vital link in the \nmedical system, high staffing of RN's will provide an efficient model to address each \noffender's medical and mental health needs \nThe possibility exists that once all programming is in place throughout the system, more \nnurse staffing will become necessary. \nStaffing Model: \nDirector of Nursing \nJCCY will have a DON. She will be a Registered Nurse (RN) and will provide oversight for \nall nursing duties at the assigned facility. She will have correctional and / or adolescent \nnursing experience. The DON will be on-site 40 hours per week. \nIntake Nurses \nIntake nurses will be RN's and will be responsible for conducting the intake assessments on \nthe approximately 40 offenders / week that are processed at JCCY. They will be on-site \napproximately 40 hours per week. \nSick Call \nRegistered Nurses will conduct sick call in all facilities as needed. \nInfirmary Nurses \nRN's and LPN's will be assigned to the infirmary. The infirmary will be staffed 24-hours per \nday, 7 days per week with nurses that have skilled nursing experience. The staffing model \nused for the infirmaries is approximately as follows: \n7A—3P—2 RN's/ 1 LPN 3P—11P—2 RN's / 1 LPN 11P—7A—2 RN / 1 LPN  \nAdditionally, one of the RN's on duty for the infirmary will be responsible for conducting \nsegregation rounds. \nMedication Administration \nThis nursing duty will primarily be performed by LPN's in each of the five facilities. The \nstaffing of this duty will be approximately as follows: \n7A—3P—2 LPN's 3P—11P—2 LPN's 11P—7A—1 LPN  \n\n \nBibliography: \nStandards for Health Services in Juvenile Detention and Confinement Facilities.

JETSON DIAGNOSTIC CENTER (JDC)—MENTAL \nHEALTH ASSESSMENT \nAll juvenile offenders in the custody of the Department of Corrections receive medical, \nmental health, and dental screenings at the Jetson Diagnostic Center. After assessment is \ncompleted, these youth are transferred, if necessary, to a destination facility that serves \ntheir rehabilitation and/or treatment needs. Approximately 2,000 children are evaluated at \nthe JDC each year. \nThe goal of the mental health assessment is to identify strengths as well as mental health \ntreatment needs. With proper treatment of serious mental illness, offenders can better \nparticipate in correctional, school, and other programs. To this end, assessment will be \ndesigned to assist in treatment planning. Generally, the assessment process will be \ncompleted by thirty (30) days of admission. Protocols for assessment, specifically \npsychological components will be developed at the JDC, under the direction of the JDC \nDirector of Psychology Services. Protocols will be used system-wide, with ongoing training \nof correctional facility mental health staff as new instruments are developed/utilized via \ntelehealth, staff meetings, and the juvenile justice training program. \n996*996 A. Initial Mental Health Screening \nWhen a youth is admitted to JDC, he or she will undergo an initial mental health screening \n(protocol to be developed) to be performed immediately by trained nursing personnel, \nclinical social workers, or trained correctional officers. This screening is intended to identify \nany potential emergency situations among new arrivals to the facility. This screen will \nassess whether the youth is experiencing significant current psychiatric difficulties, suicidal \nideation, or homicidal ideation. \nIf after initial mental health screening the youth responds positively to questions of suicidal \nor homicidal ideation or is observed as presenting such a risk, he or she will be referred to a \nQualified Mental Health Professional (QMHP, i.e., social worker, psychological associate) \nwithin twenty-four (24) hours. Until that time, the youth will be placed in a \"crisis bed\". When \nclinically indicated, the QMHP will contact the on-call psychiatrist for crisis management. \nB. Intake Mental Health Evaluation \nFollowing the initial mental health screening, all youth will receive an intake mental health \nevaluation by a QMHP to be completed by the end of fourteen (14) calendar days of \nadmission. This evaluation will generally be initiated the first business day following \nadmission to JDC. Pertinent releases of informational issues regarding confidentiality will be \ndiscussed at this time. The results of the assessment and all recommendations will become \na part of the juvenile's health record. The Intake Mental Health Evaluation of seriously \nmentally ill offenders will include a DSM-IV diagnosis and clinical recommendations, \nincluding suggestions for treatment planning. This evaluation will consist of an 1) interview \nwith the youth, 2) psychological screening, 3) assessment of intelligence, and 4) collateral \ninterviews when possible and 5) review of all records available. \n\n \n1. Interview with the Youth \nThe youth will undergo a structured interview regarding his or her history of psychiatric \nhospitalization and outpatient treatment, current psychotropic medications, suicidal ideation \nand history of suicidal behavior, drug usage, alcohol usage, sexual history, history of \nviolence initiated as a result of interpersonal altercation where the goal is to injure the other \nperson, history of victimization due to criminal violence and abuse, special education \nplacement, history of cerebral trauma or seizures, and emotional response to incarceration \n(Metzner, 1997). \n2. Psychological Screening \nThe youth will complete a psychological screening instrument either by computer or self-\nreport (with assistance if reading and comprehension level is below the fourth grade). \nInitially, this measure will be the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MaYSI; \nGrisso & Barnum, 1998) though this may be changed in the future if another measure is \ndeemed more appropriate or more useful. The MaYSI was developed to identify potential \nmental health needs of youth in the juvenile justice system. It consists of 52 yes/no \nquestions and has been normed with juvenile offenders. The MaYSI has nine (9) subscales \nincluding alcohol/drug use, anger, anxiety, depressed mood, impulsivity, somatic \ncomplaints, suicide ideation, thought disturbance, and traumatic experiences. \nShould either the MaYSI or any of the other components of the intake mental health \nevaluation suggest that the youth is experiencing significant psychiatric symptoms, \nadditional psychological testing will be performed when needed by a QMHP under the \nsupervision of a licensed clinical psychologist or by a licensed clinical psychologist. This \nfurther testing will be tailored to address the specific areas of concern (e.g., psychosis, \ndepression, anxiety, etc.) rather than a general assessment of psychopathology. The further \ntesting could either be conducted 997*997 at JDC or at the destination facility, whichever is \nmore appropriate. \n3. Assessment of Intelligence and Adaptive \nFunctioning \nAssessment of intelligence will occur during the intake mental health evaluation. This \nassessment can be completed in one of two ways—1) a group screening measure to \nidentify persons with possible mental retardation to be followed by an individually \nadministered intelligence test (e.g., Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Third Edition) \nif the screen suggests possible mental retardation or 2) an abbreviated, individually \nadministered intelligence test (e.g., Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test; Wechsler Abbreviated \nScale of Intelligence) to be administered to all youth. The latter would allow a brief (usually \n30 minutes per child), reliable, and valid measure of intelligence when screening for mental \nretardation or giftedness. \nIf an individual's intelligence is measured to be less than 70, adaptive behavior assessment \nwill occur. The assessment of adaptive behaviors may occur with regard to communication, \n\n \nuse of community resources, functional academics, home living, health and safety, leisure, \nself-care, self-direction, social, and work skills. Attempts will be made to contact the youth's \nfamily to evaluate areas of functioning and to determine strengths and weaknesses. \nHowever, contact with the family is not always possible. For these cases, teachers, direct \ncare staff, unit social workers, or the youth may be interviewed with regard to the above. \nProposed measures include the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and the Adaptive \nBehavior Assessment System. \nMeasuring adaptive functioning is useful for purposes of treatment planning and skill \ndevelopment. To this end, if no family member is able to be contacted and if direct care or \nteaching staff does not have an adequate sample of the youth's behavior from which to rate \nhis or her adaptive functioning, this component of the assessment will be completed by or \nunder the supervision of clinical or school psychologists at the destination facility within 60 \ndays of admission to that facility. \n(Assessment of academic achievement and learning disabilities will not be provided by \nmental health services). \n4. Collateral Interview \nCollateral interviews will be conducted, when possible, via telephone, Telehealth, or in \nperson with the youth's family, guardian, or other individuals familiar with the youth's \nfunctioning. Additionally, the evaluating professionals will consult with correctional officers \nduring the assessment phase regarding any problem behaviors that may occur. These \ninterviews may be conducted by QMHP's or clerical staff by using a structured interview \nquestionnaire with follow up interview if necessary by QMHP's. \n5. Review of Records \nAs noted by statute, the court assigning the child to the Department of Corrections shall \nprovide written findings indicating the need for placement within the Louisiana Office of \nYouth Corrections, along with all available legal, medical, and mental health, and school \nrecords, reports reflecting the social background of the youth, family status, mode of living, \nbehavior tendencies, or any other records that provide pertinent information about the youth \nupon admission to JDC. Protocols for exchange of information between the JDC and \nState/DOC Educational services will be developed. (An important feature of a thorough \nassessment is a record review; an automatic court order is recommended, via agreement \nso that all relevant records can be obtained as quickly as possible.) \nC. Psychiatric Evaluation \nIf the youth has a history of recent treatment with psychotropic medication or if the \noffender's symptoms suggest he or she would benefit from a referral for possible medication \nmanagement, he or she will 998*998 be referred to a psychiatrist for a complete psychiatric \nevaluation, including a DSM-IV diagnosis and psychiatric recommendations. Following the \npsychiatric evaluation, other evaluations and diagnostic tests (i.e., medical tests, laboratory \n\n \nwork, neurological evaluations, or emergency inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, etc.) will \nbe recommended and conducted as needed. If the youth enters the facility taking \npsychotropic medications, the psychiatrist will conduct a medication evaluation within 24 \nhours or first business day, with a complete psychiatric evaluation within one (1) week of \nadmission. Otherwise, the psychiatric evaluation, when indicated, will take place no later \nthan two (2) weeks from referral. \nD. Assessment and Recommendation Staffing for \nOffenders with Serious Mental Health Needs \nGenerally no later than thirty (30) days from admission (following the completion of the \nassessment), the JDC Assessment and Recommendation Team (ART) will meet. This team \nwill be composed of a placement specialist designated by the Department of Corrections, a \nmember of the youth's mental health diagnostic team (e.g., social worker, psychological \nassociate, psychologist), educational representative when indicated, the youth, and his or \nher parent or guardian (if possible). The child's family or guardian can participate either in \nperson, via Telehealth or via telephone (unless considered to be detrimental to the youth's \nwell being). The lead psychologist or his/her designee will be in charge the staffing. Other \nprofessionals familiar with the youth whose input is necessary for determining optimal \ntreatment are invited to attend (e.g., medical, school, corrections personnel, etc.). At the \ntime of the ART staffing all diagnostic mental health assessments should be in the \noffender's permanent medical record. The goal of the ART staffing is to make final \nrecommendations regarding all treatment needs of those offenders identified with serious \nmental health needs. (Treatment will be implemented at destination site, by treatment team) \nE. Issues Related to the Destination Facility \nThe intake mental health assessment and the psychiatric evaluation (if applicable) will \naccompany those offenders with serious mental health needs to the destination facility via \ntheir permanent health record. Unless contraindicated at the current time, the treatment \nrecommendations outlined in the JDC intake mental health evaluation should be followed \nwith the treatment plan more fully developed if necessary to address any other indicated \nissues at the destination facility. The treatment plan can be amended by the receiving \ntreatment team at any time, but must be reviewed initially. As stated earlier; further \npsychological testing and/or adaptive behavior testing may occur at the destination site; at a \nminimum, guidelines set by the JDC for psychological testing will be followed. (Year one \nTreatment Plans will be implemented at Jetson only by LSUHSC) \nF. Jetson Diagnostic Center Personnel \nIn order to adequately screen and evaluate the 2,000 youth admitted to the JDC, a number \nof staff are needed. These include a director of the JDC, adequate child and adolescent \npsychiatric time, Board Certified psychologists with specialized training in child and \nadolescent psychology, and one with additional licensure in neuropsychology. All must be \nlicensed in order to provide supervision. One will serve as the Assistant Director of the JDC \nand as Training director for the development of a clinical psychology postdoctoral \n\n \nfellowship. Support staff are required, such as data entry clerks, staff for program evaluation \n(Masters Level in Human Service Field), secretarial support and transcriptions services are \nnecessary due to the number of assessment reports. A post-doctoral training program will \nbe developed at the JDC in year 2-3 for specialized post-graduate 999*999 experience in \njuvenile correctional psychology. Corrections will provide officers to transport youth to all \nmental health appointments in a timely manner. \nG. Additional Issues \n1. It will be necessary that adequate office space, storage rooms, office supplies, and space \nfor assessment be provided. Furthermore, a waiting area for youth is necessary. It is \nrecommended this area should be equipped with a television and VCR so that \npsychoeducation, hygiene, and other instructional videos can be shown to the youth while \nthey wait for appointments. \n2. The MaYSI should be developed into a computer-administered test that can be \nautomatically scored once the youth completes the measure. \n3. Psychological assessment tests, forms, and supplies need to be purchased. Approximate \ncost is $15.00 per offender assessed. \n4. Cooperation with the Department of Corrections to ensure that youth will generally be \nadmitted between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding \nholidays) is required. Provisions will be made for transport teams to the various correctional \ncenters and for emergencies. \n5. Liaison with judges, parish detention centers and field officers will be developed as \npossible so that all court/detention/probation records accompany youth upon their arrival to \nJDC. \n6. Psychometric test scoring programs for all youth coming through the JDC: \npsychopharmacology software programs are required. \n7. Computers and a networked printer will be provided via the Telehealth proposal. \nII. GENERAL POPULATION MENTAL HEALTH \nSERVICES \nA. Overview of All Facilities (To Be Implemented by \nend of Year Two) \nTARGET POPULATION: Offenders with Serious Mental Health Needs \n\n \n1. GOALS of mental health services for the Juvenile \nCorrectional Facilities: \n• To reduce the disabling effects of serious mental illness so that each offender's ability to \neffectively participate in correctional programs is maximized. \n• To help keep the correctional facility safe for offenders, volunteers, staff, and visitors. \n• To develop, with the collaboration of Corrections, an agency-wide behavior management \nand skill development system focusing on consequence-based rewards and demerits, \nimplemented on a corrections-wide basis, with all mental health staff and correctional \nemployees trained in this system via the Juvenile Justice Training Program. \n2. Structure \nConceptually, each juvenile correctional facility will have a \"community mental health \ncenter\". Treatment of seriously mentally ill youth will utilize the intake assessment and \nrecommendations provided by the JDC. Treatments provided will include when indicated \nintake screenings, psychiatric evaluation, evaluation and management of psychiatric \nmedications, crisis intervention services, residential treatment, stabilization of acute \npsychiatric illness, brief psychotherapy, case management, specialized behavioral \nmanagement, family therapy, group therapy, treatment team planning, consultation \nservices, and discharge planning (emphasizing coordination with outpatient services and \nfamily reintegration). Family meetings will occur via telehealth when the family cannot \nattend in person whenever possible (provided the family will participate). Telehealth will also \nbe used for intrafacility conferencing 1000*1000 when a youth is transferred, consultation \nbetween professional staff, and discharge planning with the family. Any of the above \nservices may be rendered via Telehealth when appropriate/possible. \nConsultation services will be provided upon request to correctional officers, supervisors, \nwardens, and education staff with regard to any offender in the facility experiencing \ndifficulties or whom staff has concerns regarding the mental health needs of the youth. \nWeekly mental health rounds of all juvenile offenders placed in segregated housing will \noccur. Offenders placed in segregated housing who are under the care of mental health \nteam will be seen within 24 hours. \nGenerally those offenders with the most serious mental health needs will be treated at \nJetson, Bridge City, and Swanson due to the proximity of tertiary care facilities, increased \nprofessional staff availability, and special treatment units unless contraindicated for security \nreasons. \n3. Treatment Planning (@Jetson only Year One) \nUpon transfer of the offender with serious mental health needs, the initial mental health \nscreening and contact with family will be performed by the youth's social worker for all youth \n\n \nrecommended for mental health treatment services by the JDC, and for youth receiving \nmental health services who are transferred from another facility. This will occur in order to \nassess whether any difficulties have arisen during the transfer and to establish open lines of \ncommunication between the destination facility and the family/youth. Additionally, the youth \nwith mental illness will meet a member of his/her treatment team with 24 hours of arrival at \nthe facility. \nYouth with mental health treatment plans will be under the direct care of the mental health \ntreatment team (i.e., such as the psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, psychological \nassociate, correctional officers, etc.) at each facility. This team will be responsible for \nimplementing the treatment plans of youth with serious mental illness and will meet initially \nto assess the efficacy of the plan and make revisions as indicated. Once the seriously \nmentally ill youth is stabilized in the general population, treatment plans will be reviewed \nevery three (3) months. If youth should experience a crisis or other change in status, the \ncrisis intervention protocols for seriously mentally ill will be followed. \nOnce a month, the seriously mentally ill youth's social worker will communicate any special \nconcerns to the correctional officers and teachers. Relevant information regarding youth's \nprogress and any adverse medication side effects that may be occurring will be sought by \nthe youth's social worker. The social worker, in turn, will communicate with the psychiatrist \nwhen reviewing treatment progress to assess the efficacy of treatment and make revisions \nwhere indicated, and be available for consultations regarding the youth. It is the \nresponsibility of the youth's social worker to gather and disseminate relevant mental health \ninformation. \n4. Comprehensive Mental Health Services (at the end \nof year 2) \nEssential mental health services will include access to acute care services, access to \nresidential services, access to crisis and respite services, and 24-hour mental health \ncoverage by qualified mental health professionals, and an on-call psychiatrist. The above \nservices should greatly decrease the need for acute psychiatric hospitalization, but in the \nrare case it is needed, it will be the responsibility of the Department of Corrections to obtain \nin a timely manner (Pharmaceuticals will be provided by the Department of Corrections.) \nSystem-wide protocols for youth with serious mental health needs will be developed to \nensure a consistent response to mental health crises, including suicide prevention, \nseclusion and restraints, and selfmutilation, by the end of year one. \n1001*1001 Trainees (e.g., child psychiatry and forensic psychiatry fellows, clinical \npsychology interns, post doctoral psychology fellows, post masters social workers and \nsocial work interns) from Louisiana State University Health Sciences Centers in New \nOrleans and Shreveport and Earl K. Long Hospital in Baton Rouge will be included in the \nmental health services divisions, residential treatment units, and diagnostic reception center \nwhenever possible. These individuals would receive supervision from the recognized \nsupervisor within their discipline. \n\n \n5. Transition Planning \nThe social workers of the offenders in need of mental heath treatment after discharge from \nthe correctional facility will contact the social worker at each facility at least forty-five (45) \ndays prior to the child's release date. At each facility a social worker will be responsible for \nassisting these seriously mentally ill youth in transition from correctional facilities back to the \ncommunity. The social worker will compare the mental health and medical record or \nmentally ill youth and will communicate the special needs of the youth with mental illness so \nthat a successful transition into the community is accomplished. The social worker will \nspecifically work with the guardians in the placement to which the child is going, ensuring \ntransfer of information, and that services are in place. The social worker will maintain \ncontact as needed for up to thirty (30) days after release. \n6. Additional Issues \na) The Department of Corrections will provide appropriate bed space for the offender with \nacute psychiatric needs one (1) male \"bed\" designated and one (1) female \"bed\" \ndesignated). The Department of Corrections will provide adequate correctional officer \nstaffing so that the youth will be observed every minute by the trained correctional officer, \nand accompanied at all times by the trained correctional officer. (at Jetson only Year One) \nb) The Department of Corrections will provide for a twelve (12) bed residential mental health \nunit for female offenders at Jetson Correctional Center for Youth. The Department of \nCorrections will provide adequate correctional officer coverage for this unit (a minimum of \ntwo (2) trained correctional officers present on the unit at all times). (By the end of Year \nTwo) \nc) The Department of Corrections will expand current residential mental health unit at \nSwanson Correctional Center for Youth to the full capacity of sixty-two (62) beds and \nprovide adequate correctional officer staffing (a minimum of six (6) trained correctional \nofficers present on the unit, two (2) in each area, at all times.) (Year One) \nd) The Department of Corrections will provide an eight to ten (8-10) bed residential unit at \nSwanson Correctional Center for Youth for those offenders with both serious mental illness \nand moderate to severe developmental disability. The Department of Corrections will also \nprovide adequate correctional officer coverage ( a minimum of three (3) trained correctional \nofficers present at all times.) (By the end of Year Two) \ne) \"Crisis beds\" will be designated at each facility. These beds are for seriously mentally ill \nyouth that are clinically determined to be considered dangerous to self or others. A specially \ntrained correctional officer will observe the youth every minute and document observation. \nAdmission to and discharge from the infirmary crisis and respite beds are by MD orders \nonly. (Jetson only Year One) \nf) \"Respite beds\" will be designated at each facility for those offenders in need of immediate \nsupervision and intervention secondary to serious mental health needs, although not at a \nlevel of danger to self or others. (Jetson only Year Two) \n\n \ng) Laboratory services should be available on a routine and emergency basis in all facilities. \n1002*1002 h) Psychological assessment tests, forms, and supplies should be provided. The \naverage cost per child evaluated is approximately $15. \ni) At each facility, it will be necessary that there be adequate office space, storage rooms for \ncharts, and adequate space for individual and group therapy. \nj) Computers with Internet access, network printers and software will be provided in all \nfacilities via the Telehealth proposal budget. \nk) Office equipment and supplies are required at each facility. \nB. Mental Health Services Staffing \nAdequate mental health staffing will include a variety of mental health personnel including \nBC/BE child and adolescent psychiatrist, child psychologists, clinical social workers, \npsychological assistants, psychiatric nursing staff, and correctional officers with special \ntraining in mental health issues. Nurses trained in mental health will be designated at each \nfacility through the Health Care Proposal. Correctional officers will be selected who will work \nclosely in collaboration with the mental health staff on the specialized units. They will \naccompany offenders to all mental health appointments and be available should security \nneeds arise. \n1. Jetson Mental Health Services \n(This does not include the diagnostic and reception center.) \nA. General Population \nJetson has approximately 174 female offenders, and 322 male offenders, for a total of 496 \nyouth in its general population. Our goal is to add treatment programming for all youth with \nserious mental health needs, including special treatment programming for female offenders \nwith serious mental health needs. \nIn order to provide adequate psychiatric care for the seriously mentally ill youth housed in \nJetson's general population, child psychiatric time will be required. A clinical psychologist's \nexpertise is necessary for additional psychological evaluations based on new/exacerbated \nbehavior/psychiatric difficulties, and in the creation of an individualized behavior \nmanagement protocol and to conduct therapy/supervision. Psychological assistants are \nnecessary to administer psychological testing, to assist in developing individualized \nbehavior management protocols, and to conduct therapy. Psychiatric nursing is necessary \nto provide mental health nursing care covered in health care proposal. This individual would \nalso serve as a liaison to other nursing staff in order to improve care of mentally ill youth \nacross disciplines. Master's level social workers will be necessary to provide treatment and \n\n \ncase management services, at least one of whom should be a licensed medical social \nworker who will function in a supervisory capacity of those unlicensed social workers. \nB. Residential Mental Health Treatment Unit for \nFemale Offenders (By end of year two and dependent \non physical facility availability) \nDevelopment of a Residential Mental Health Program (RMHP) serving a total of twelve (12) \nfemale youth is proposed. This would be a similar program to that which currently exists at \nthe Swanson Correctional Center, a psychiatric residential setting for seriously mentally ill \nyouth who cannot be managed in the general population and are in need of or more \nintensive diagnostic and treatment services. \nIn order to provide services for this population it is estimated that child and adolescent \npsychiatric time, psychology time, additional psychiatric nursing (not provided by the health \ncare proposal), social worker, psychological assistant and psychiatric aides or correctional \nofficers (a minimum of two trained officers present at all times) and clerical services are \nrequired. \n1003*1003 C. Acute Care Psychiatric \"bed\" (Year One) \nThe designation of an additional \"acute care bed\", the site of which should be acceptable to \nthe Medical Director of the Mental Health Services necessary for the short-term stabilization \nof female offenders with acute psychiatric illness; who can be treated adequately in the \ncorrectional setting. These services would be for youth who are for example acutely \npsychotic, manic or depressed. These individuals require acute treatment as they are \npotentially dangerous to themselves and or others as a result of an acute mental illness. \nAdditional staffing for this service would include a psychiatric aide (or trained correctional \nofficer) to observe the youth every minute. \nNeeds \n1). Physical plant and programming issues need to be addressed concerning females. \n2). Programs will be developed to address gender-specific issues for seriously mentally ill \nfemale offenders. \n3). Designation of acute care \"bed\" with adequate staff available at all times. \n4) In those instances, where the acute care treatment is not adequate, it will be DOC's \nresponsibility to obtain hospital services in a timely manner. \nC. Mental Health Coverage (Year one-Jetson/JRDC \nonly) \n\n \nIt will be necessary to provide 24-hour mental health coverage for crisis situations. During \nnormal working hours, coverage will occur by an on call QMHP staff designated at each \nfacility with psychiatric back up in person, via telephone, or via telehealth for each facility. \nDuring holidays, weekends, and after hours, the RN on site will be initially consulted. If \nnecessary the RN will contact the on call psychiatrist available by telephone. Should the \nyouth require a face to face contact, the QMHP on call will go to the correctional facility, \nevaluate the youth, and contact the on-call psychiatrist via telephone. One (1) QMHP would \nbe designated \"on call\" evenings, holidays, and weekends at each facility. One (1) \npsychiatrist would be designated \"on call\" for Jetson & JRDC. A psychiatrist or emergency \nroom physician would be available via telehealth if deemed necessary by the RN and MD \non call. \nD. Administration \n1. Structure (At Jetson by end of Year One)(At all \nfacilities by end of Year Two) \nAdministratively each juvenile correctional facility will have a medical director of psychiatric \nservices, a director of social work services, and a director of psychology services. One of \nthese professionals will be appointed to administrate and coordinate mental health care at \nthat individual facility. This person will be accountable to the Director of Health Care of that \nfacility. By the end of year two, each of the juvenile correctional facilities will have a Director \nof Health Care (directly responsible to the Director of Operations for the Juvenile Justice \nProgram) and will oversee the provision of pediatric, dental, and mental health care at their \nfacility. Year one, the Director of Operations will serve as the Director of Health Care at \nJetson/JRDC. \nThe Medical Director of Psychiatric Services at each facility would supervise all clinical \njudgments regarding psychiatric and mental health care at each individual facility, \nimplement clinical policies and monitor overall mental health treatment. The Director of \nMental Health Care at each individual facility (Ph.D., BCSW, or MD) would be responsible \nfor programmatic concerns including mental health center employee management and all \nday to day clinical activities. He/she would also be responsible for ensuring that all mental \nhealth policies are carried out at that facility. \nLSUHSC has the ability to recommend to the Department of Public Safety and 1004*1004 \nCorrections (DPS & C) policy and procedures that relate to the provision of health services \nbut that have concurrent operational interface with the unit. (LSUHSC can evaluate DPS & \nC compliance with recommendations and report accordingly.) \nLSUHSC may make recommendations to DPS & C relative to offender transfers but may \nnot order such transfers (LSUHSC may evaluate DPS & C in timely compliance with \nrecommendations.) DPS & C must document reason if youth is not transferred. \n\n \nLSUHSC Directors of Mental Health, Social Work, Psychology, Nursing, Dental, and \nAdolescent Health Services, Training/Research and Psychology will be directly responsible \nto the Program Director of the LSUHSC Juvenile Justice Program. The LSUHSC Directors \nwill recruit and hire all employees within their disciplines, develop training programs, such \nas the social work post-masters child forensic fellowship, and the post-doctoral psychology \nfellowship. He/She will lead the development of protocols in their discipline, and the \ndissemination of that information to all directors of their field at each institution. He/She will \nbe professionally responsible for the directors at each facility in their field. \n2. Policies and Procedures/Quality Assurance for \nOffenders with Serious Mental Health Needs (By End \nof Year One) \nPolicies and procedures for the provision of mental health services and documentation of \nthose services will be developed for use by LSUHSC staff in all facilities as well as site \nspecific policies when indicated. These policies and procedures will be updated annually \nand will include: \na. Crisis intervention protocols including suicide and violence prevention \nb. acute drug/alcohol intoxication and withdrawal (to be developed in collaboration with \nPediatrics) \nc. sexual assault (to be developed in collaboration with Pediatrics) \nd. seclusion and restraints of mentally ill youth \ne. psychopharmacology—management of psychotropic medications \nIt must be the policy and procedure of each facility that clinical decisions and actions \nregarding mental health care services be the sole responsibility of the qualified mental \nhealth care professional. \nReview panels will be established to ensure adequate documentation of mental health \nencounters. This will include policies on confidentiality, sharing of information, availability \nand use of records, transfer of records, and retention of records. \nA QA Program and committee will be established to monitor the quality of mental health \nservices provided. Review panels will be established to ensure adequate documentation of \nall mental health encounters. The quality assurance committee on a quarterly basis and will \nconduct chart reviews. \nA Director/Coordinator of Quality Assurance will be appointed who will be directly \naccountable to the Program Director. The QA Director will chair the Quality Assurance and \nPolicy and Procedure Committees. \n3. System-Core Administrative Staffing Requirements \n\n \nAdministrative staff will be responsible clinically and administratively at Jetson/JRDC Year \nOne. A core administrative staff is required to oversee the quality of provision of mental \nhealth services to Juvenile Corrections.

Children in \njuvenile correctional facilities are often diagnosed with mental illness, medical illness, or \ndevelopmental disabilities. Many have substance abuse disorders, are victims or \nperpetrators of abuse/sexual abuse, are behaviorally disordered, are at risk to harm others \nor self, and many often require crisis interventions. In addition, children in Louisiana's \njuvenile correctional facilities range in age from 10 to 21, requiring staff to understand \nworking with children and adolescents, such as reasonable expectations for their \ndevelopmental level. Children in close confinement can be at risk of harm from serious \noffenders, gang members, sex offenders, and those few staff who abuse their positions of \npower. It is essential that staff understand these realities and the special dangers they \n\n \npresent. Finally, knowledge of the proper use of seclusion and restraint in the mentally \ndisordered youth are also necessary. \nIn order to continue the positive cultural change that has begun by the current \nadministration, it is imperative that all staff at every level of the organization have a \nconsistent and practical understanding of fundamental principles. \nSkills required in juvenile correctional staff depend on the particular job of the individual; \nhowever all staff require training in the special needs of children as noted in the areas \nabove. Thus, adequate supervision and training of all staff is necessary. Particularly noted \nis the importance of individualized treatment, the need for specific types of skills training, \nand collaboration between correctional staff, mental health staff, educational staff, medical \nstaff, and administration. Also important is a systematic way of handling problems, and \ninteraction with other systems and the child's family especially upon admission and \ndischarge. \nSupervisors and Administrators should be trained in the roles of professional staff, \nmaintaining adequate supervision of children and staff, methods of decreasing staff \nturnover, promoting improved communications/liaisons among all staff, development of \nevidence staff is learning and using new knowledge. \nGOALS AND OBJECTIVES \nThe basic goals of training include safety, core clinical issues, and oversight. \nGoals of Training: \n1009*1009 1. Each staff member will understand the joint mission and philosophy of the \nLSUHSC Juvenile Justice Training Program and the Office of Youth Development. \n2. Each staff member will understand the basic normal development of children and \nadolescents. \n3. Each staff member will have a basic understanding of the special needs of children in \nregards to medical and mental health needs. \n4. Each staff member will have a basic understanding of positive behavioral change in \nchildren in the juvenile correctional system. \n5. Each staff member will understand the rights and responsibilities of each youth in the \njuvenile correctional system. \n6. Each staff member will be aware of the responsibilities of other staff member working \nwithin the juvenile correctional system. \n7. Each staff member will exhibit a practical working knowledge of the specific skills \nnecessary to perform their particular job with efficiency, efficacy, and professionalism. \nObjectives of Training: \n\n \n1. Each staff member will be able to cite the basic concepts of positive behavioral change \nfor children. \n2. Each staff member will be able to demonstrate through role-playing the ability to use their \nlearned skills in the performance of their duties. \n3. Each staff member will be able to identify basic signs of mental illness, medical disorders, \nand developmental disorders. \n4. Each staff member will demonstrate via testing knowledge retained via training. \nTRAINING AUDIENCE \nAll staff of juvenile correctional facilities must receive specialized training in order to work \nwithin this setting. Correctional work is an area of specialized knowledge and skill, and \nparticularly so for juvenile corrections. This type of work is extremely stressful at times for \nboth staff and youth requiring an adequate level of training, supervision, and support to \nmeet the goal of protection from harm for both staff and children. This area of knowledge is \nrapidly growing, both legally and clinically, and the need for all staff to receive current \ninformation and skills as becomes available is crucial. \nTarget Audiences: \n1. Administrators/Supervisors \n2. Project Zero Tolerance Investigators \n3. Clinicians \n4. Educators \n5. Correctional Officers \n6. Ancillary Staff \n7. Advocates \n8. Volunteers \n(Training for Judges and Attorneys who directly work with juvenile delinquents would be \nespecially beneficial, as well. Education regarding appropriateness of sentencing, special \nneeds populations, delineating those children who actually pose a risk to the community \nversus those who could remain on probation, the use of diversion programs, etc. would add \nto the overall benefit of the juvenile correctional system as it directly relates to the judiciary.) \nTYPES OF TRAINING \n1. CORE TRAINING: Eventually, this will comprise the pre-service training package for all \nemployees newly hired to the juvenile correctional facilities. During Year 2 of this contract, \nall existing department or institutional employees will receive this block of training, until all \n\n \nexisting employees have been trained. This will ensure that all staff share a collective and \nconsistent vision of the shared mission and philosophy. \n2. PRE-SERVICE TRAINING: All newly hired correctional officers must 1010*1010 \ncomplete this 20 hour block as part of their mandatory pre-service training, prior to \nbeginning work. \n3. INSERVICE TRAINING/CONTINUING EDUCATION: All staff must receive continuing \neducation, which shall include core instruction for all staff and elective training modules, \nwhich may be selected by the staff member and/or mandated according to the person's \nspecific job duties. \nPre-Service Training will be offered bimonthly at a central location. In addition, specific \nannual training of twenty hours per year would be required for certain types of employee. All \nstaff completing the basic training and annual training hours would receive certificates of \ntraining from LSU Health Sciences Center. \n1. Year Two (Initial Core Training of All Current \nEmployees): \nAs start up, all staff currently employed by juvenile correction facilities will require the core \ntraining of 20 hours, approximately 1500 employees, divided among four correctional \nfacilities. Continuing Education credits will be provided for clinical staff, i.e., social workers, \npsychologists, physicians. \n2. Core Training for New Correctional Officers Year \nTwo: \nThe core basic curricula will be offered at the Training Academy on the schedule for new \ncorrectional officers, approximately twice per month. \n3. Annual Update Training subsequent to Year One \n(see above)—To Begin Year 2: \nTwenty hours of continuing education will be provided for all specialized staff and \ncorrectional officers in their area of specialty and core information. This will be provided on \nsite and via telehealth. \n4. Semiannual Site Visits: \nSite visits would occur on a semiannual basis beginning after training is initiated order to \nassess the ability of the staff to utilize the knowledge from the training, to conduct training \nneeds assessment through individual conferences, focus groups, and administration \nsurveys, and to gather other information for future trainings in each specialty area. \n\n \n5. Documentation of Training: \nEach juvenile facility's administration will be responsible for documentation of all employees' \ncompletion of required training. LSUHSC will offer a certificate of completion of the core \nbasic training, and annual training. \n6. Access to Literature and Reference Materials: \nIt is recommended that each facility have basic current reference books as an adjunct to \ntraining which should be supplied on a yearly basis by the Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections such as the 1) Physician's Desk Reference, 2) The Louisiana Children's Code, \n3) Child Social Work Reference, Child Psychiatric Text, and 4) Pediatric Reference \nMaterial., 5) Medical Dictionary. \n7. Consultative Services \nAs per request of Corrections, the JJTP will provide consultative services in reviewing all \ntraining currently provided by DPS and C to juvenile correctional officers to determine \nappropriateness, relevance, and priority and make recommendations to the Assistant \nSecretary. \nSAMPLE CURRICULUMS (Curriculum will be determined and developed during year one \nimplementation; as well as based upon settlement agreement) \nSAMPLE CORE TRAINING FOR ALL STAFF: \nI. Basic Constitutional and Legal Rights of Juvenile Offenders \nII. Overall Mission and Philosophy of LSUHSC JJTP \nIII.

In order to further implement the paragraphs\nof the Juvenile Justice Agreement concerning the case\nmanagement system (i.e., paragraphs 55, 56, 57, 80(n), 87,\n90, 108, 110, 111, 112, 113, and 115), the State, with\ntechnical assistance from the Independent Expert, will:\nA. establish and implement policies and\nprocedures that will make it the regular and routine\npractice for each youth to work with one caseworker during\nhis or her time at a correctional facility;\nB. make it the regular and routine practice\nfor caseworkers to have an individual counseling session\nwith a youth promptly when one of the following events\noccur: (1) the youth is in danger of having his custody\nlevel increased due to an increased number of disciplinary\ntickets; (2) the court denies the youth early release;\n(3) the facility either removes the youth from the short-\nterm program or extends his time in the short-term program;\n- 8 -\n\nor (4) the facility decides not to recommend the youth\nfor early release even though he or she has maintained a\nminimum custody level for two consecutive quarters. The\ncounseling session will be designed to help the youth\ndevelop concrete strategies for dealing with the problems\n(e.g., strategies for avoiding future tickets, strategies\nfor completing the short-term program, strategies for\nobtaining a recommendation for early release). In\naddition, the caseworker will record notes from the\ncounseling session in the youth's file. This counseling\nsession does not replace or substitute the youth's regular,\nindividual counseling session with the caseworker. The\ncaseworker will be encouraged to share relevant information\nlearned in these sessions with the interdisciplinary team\nduring the youth's quarterly staffing and the team will\ndecide whether the youth's individualized intervention plan\n(\"IIP\") needs to be modified to include additional\nprogramming or rehabilitative services;\nC. establish and implement policies and\nprocedures ensuring that the Office of Youth Development\n(\"OYD\") employees coordinate their efforts to ensure that\nmotions, or letters if they are sufficient for that court,\nto modify youths' dispositions to less secure settings are\ntimely filed with the court; and\nD. continue to work with Dr. James Austin\nto identify youth deemed inappropriate for secure care and\nwork with relevant State officials, including providing\nnotification to the Louisiana Indigent Defense Assistance\nBoard (\"LIDAB\"), to obtain a modification of disposition\nfrom the court for these youth.\n13. The State will continue to improve access to\ncourts provided to all incarcerated youth. To that end,\nthe State will:\nA. provide two attorneys to support and\nhelp develop access to the courts for youth. To that end,\nthe parties agree that their principle responsibilities\nwill be:\ni. to monitor and support\nmodifications of dispositions of those juveniles identified\nby the State as appropriate for modification and direct\nthat information to the youth's attorney;\n- 9 -\n\nii. notify the LIDAB when a youth\nseeks to retain counsel and the youth either never had an\nattorney or the youth's attorney no longer represents\nhim/her; and\niii. train caseworkers and other\nfacility staff to encourage juveniles to use the\nadministrative remedies when the youth have a complaint.\nB. amend DPSC policies and procedures\nregarding access to courts. To that end, the State will\npermit youth to visit and communicate confidentially with\nattorneys and place attorney's phone numbers on their\napproved telephone lists without parental consent. In\naddition, the State will adopt policies and procedures to\nrecognize an attorney-client relationship without parental\nconsent. Under these policies and procedures, the DPSC\nwill recognize an attorney-client relationship without\nparental consent ten days after:\ni. the DPSC has received a copy of the\njuvenile's written request for representation and a copy of\nthe juvenile's written request that the attorney have\naccess to documents from the juvenile's record (taking into\naccount the limitations described below);\nii. the DPSC has received (a) a copy\nof a letter notifying the juvenile's parent or guardian\nthat juvenile has requested representation and that the\nparent or guardian should notify DPSC or the court if they\nhave any objection, and (b) \"proof of mailing\" from the\npost office verifying that this letter has been sent to the\nparent or guardian; and\niii. the attorney has provided a\nstatement that he or she has made efforts to contact the\nparent or guardian.\nThe DPSC will recognize an attorney-client\nrelationship ten days after receipt of these documents\nunless the DPSC or the parent or guardian has submitted an\nobjection to the representation. The State agrees to\nprovide access to the youth's education records if the\nattorney obtains parental consent from the youth's parent\nor guardian.\n- 10 -\n\n14. The juvenile administrative remedy procedure\n(\"ARP\") system at each facility will include, at a minimum,\nthe following:\nA. reasonable access to ARP forms and\nreasonable access to file ARP forms. The forms and a\nmechanism for filing the forms should be readily available\nin every dorm, school, and cafeteria;\nB. assistance and/or accommodations for\nyouth who, for any reason, are unable to file a timely\nwritten ARP;\nC. a timely written response to the ARP\nthat addresses the issue or concern raised in the ARP;\nD. a mechanism to file an appeal in a\ntimely manner to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant\nSecretary or his designee will provide a timely written\nresponse; and\nE. education about the purpose of the ARP\nsystem and the procedure for filing and appealing a ARP.\n15. In an effort to clarify provisions in the\nJuvenile Justice Agreement regarding the PZT investigation\nsystem and to improve the quality of the PZT\ninvestigations, the State agrees to the following:\nA. The lead investigator at each facility\nmust have investigative experience outside of the Louisiana\njuvenile correctional system prior to being hired as a PZT\ninvestigator and must not have worked as a correctional\nofficer at the institution at which the investigator will\nbe working;\nB. In Paragraph 32 of the Juvenile Justice\nAgreement, which requires the State to create a Multiple\nAllegation Database (\"MAD\") which tracks allegations of\n\"abuse\" and \"misconduct,\" the term \"misconduct\" includes,\nat a minimum, any violation of Rule #10 (Entitled\n\"Falsifying Documents or Making False Statements\") in the\nEmployee Rulebook that DPSC used in December 2002;\nC. All current investigators must receive\ntraining to help improve their investigative techniques,\nstandardize the PZT report writing format, and better\n- 11 -\n\nunderstand the standards they are required to apply. The\ntraining will be provided in consultation with the\nIndependent Expert. The training will take into account\nthe suggestions and comments of the two former auditors,\nDale Dangremond and Terry Kincaid;\nD. The PZT system will establish and\nimplement a comprehensive training program, with technical\nassistance from the Independent Expert, that all current\ninvestigators will be required to complete by April 1,\n2003. All new investigators hired during the life of this\nAgreement will be required to complete the training program\nwithin three months of being hired. New investigators who\nhave not completed the training program shall only be\nassigned to investigations where they work under the close\nsupervision of the lead investigator and shall not have the\nauthority to conduct PZT investigations independently;\nE. The State will address management\nproblems that are uncovered during the course of a PZT\ninvestigation (e.g., inadequate staffing, contraband,\nlocation of fights or abuse, etc.);\nF. The State will review and correct the\ndisposition and sanction of any disciplinary ticket to\nensure that it is consistent with the facts and findings of\nany related substantiated PZT investigation;\nG. The State will inform, in writing, every\nyouth who files a PZT complaint against a staff member of\nthe outcome of the investigation. In addition, the State\nwill notify the youth's parent or guardian in writing when\ntheir child is the victim listed on a substantiated case of\nstaff-on-juvenile abuse; and\nH. Concurrent with the release of the\nsecond quarterly report, the Independent Expert will\nidentify, in a confidential letter to the parties, the\nnames of PZT investigators, if any, who, despite efforts to\ntrain, are not producing adequate investigations on a\nregular basis. The Independent Expert's findings must be\nsupported by examples of inadequate work product. The\nState agrees to take appropriate action such as reassigning\nthe individuals to other non-investigatory positions.\n16. Not later than February 1, 2003, DPSC shall\nassume responsibility for (1) hiring all PZT investigators,\n- 12 -\n\n(2) providing adequate initial and ongoing training for all\nPZT investigators, and (3) supervising, reviewing, and\nensuring the quality of all PZT investigations. In making\nhiring decisions, preference will be given to applicants\nwho have experience as an investigator prior to being hired\nas a PZT investigator. In addition, the State, after\nconsultation and input from the Independent Expert, will\ndevelop and implement criteria for hiring PZT investigators\nand supervisors. The individual facilities and wardens are\nrelieved of the responsibility of supervising PZT\ninvestigations. However, the wardens at each facility must\nstill review PZT investigations that substantiate abuse or\nmisconduct. The wardens at each facility must impose\nappropriate discipline for any substantiated abuse or\nmisconduct. OYD must review the discipline that the\nwardens impose and ensure that the discipline is\nappropriate given the nature and severity of the abuse or\nmisconduct.\n17. In order to provide adequate and appropriate\nservices for youth who have been identified in the LSUHSC\nassessment as (1) youth with IQs below 70; (2) victims of\nsexual abuse for whom LSUHSC has recommended treatment for\nsexual abuse; (3) youth adjudicated to secure care as a\nresult of the commission of a sexual offense or youth\ncurrently diagnosed with a sexual disorder; and (4) youth\ncurrently diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder or\nsubstance dependency disorder, the State will, in\nconsultation with LSUHSC, do the following:\nA. design and implement individualized\ntreatment plans for each youth covered in this paragraph;\nB. provide appropriate programming for\nyouth with an IQ below 70;\nC. provide training to DPSC employees to\nimplement the individualized treatment plans and\nprogramming effectively; and\nD. provide continuing quality assurance to\nensure that the treatment and programming is implemented\nproperly and is achieving the desired outcomes.\n18.

These\nreports will explain, in detail, the status of the State's\ncompliance with the terms of this Agreement;\nD. hold quarterly conferences with the\nparties so that the parties can discuss the Independent\nExpert's quarterly report.\n20. In order to enable the Independent Expert to\nperform his duties, the parties agree that the Independent\nExpert and his staff will:\nA. have reasonable access to all\nfacilities, residents, staff, documents, videos, and any\nother materials that the Independent Expert needs to\nperform his duties.\nB. be permitted to conduct confidential\ninterviews with staff and residents at all facilities; and\nC. be permitted to have ex parte\ncommunications with the parties.\n- 14 -\n\n21.

Operational compliance requires that the\nState has achieved both primary and secondary compliance,\nand that the State is following the directives in the day-\nto-day operations of the facilities.\n22. The State’s compliance with this agreement\nshall be monitored by one expert selected by the DOJ and\none expert selected by the State (the “Juvenile Justice\nExperts”).

INTRODUCTION\n1. This Agreement resolves litigation concerning the\neducational services in the State of Louisiana’s secure\njuvenile training facilities. This litigation has arisen\nfrom three sources: the long-standing consent decrees in\nWilliams v. McKeithen, Civ. No. 71-98 (M.D. La.); a\nprivate lawsuit concerning conditions at the Tallulah\nCorrectional Center for Youth entitled Brian B. v.\nStalder, Civ. No. 98-0886-B-1; and a lawsuit filed by the\nUnited States Department of Justice concerning conditions\nin four of the State's post-adjudication secure juvenile\nfacilities, United States v. Louisiana, Civ. No.\n98-0947-B-1. In order to resolve the education issues in\nthis litigation, the parties have entered into this\nAgreement, which, if substantially complied with by the\nState within the time frames specified below, will result\nin the dismissal of the education claims. The terms of\nthis Agreement shall apply to the five secure juvenile\nfacilities operated by or on behalf of the State and any\nnew secure juvenile facility opened during the life of\nthe Agreement (except that provisions that address\nspecific institutions designated by name in the text of\nthe provision shall apply only to the designated\nfacility).\n2. As part of this Agreement, the State will revise as\nPage 2 of 42\n\nnecessary its policies and procedures to ensure that they\nare consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.\nII. DEFINITIONS\n3.

BROWN, )\nPresident, Trans-American Development )\nAssoc., )\n)\nDefendants. )\n______________________________________)\nAMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nINTRODUCTION\n1. This is a civil rights class action brought by\nPlaintiffs on behalf of all juveniles who are now or in the\nfuture will be confined at the Tallulah Correctional Center for\nYouth (“TCCY”) in Tallulah, Louisiana. Plaintiffs challenge,\ninter alia, the malicious and sadistic use of force by staff on\nyouth and other cruel, unconscionable, and illegal conditions of\nconfinement at TCCY. The Defendants use and allow the use of\nexcessive force and unreasonable restraints on Plaintiffs, fail\nto protect Plaintiffs from harm, deny basic needs and services\nto Plaintiffs, fail to provide adequate programming for\nPlaintiffs, and deny Plaintiffs meaningful access to the courts\nand to their families, all as set forth below. Plaintiffs\nsuffer from each of the conditions, policies, and practices set\nforth below.\n2. Defendants are deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’\nconstitutional and legal rights, and Defendants’ conditions,\npolicies, and practices at TCCY constitute punishment and\nsubstantial departures from accepted professional judgment,\nstandards, and policies. Indeed, since it opened in 1994, TCCY\nhas not safely detained and treated youth held in the facility.\nFrom TCCY’s inception, Defendants have consciously chosen to\nprovide inadequate numbers of staff and to inadequately train\ntheir staff. Staff at TCCY is inadequately trained in the field\nof juvenile corrections and treatment. Defendants make little\neffort to adequately educate, train, and treat TCCY’s youth.\nDefendants have consistently placed profit-making above juvenile\nrehabilitation and public safety. As a result, Defendants have\nfailed the youth they confine, the staff they employ, and the\n2\n\ncommunities to which they ultimately return youth upon their\nrelease.\n3. Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the\nPlaintiff class, seek declaratory and injunctive relief against\nDefendants on the grounds that the conditions, policies, and\npractices to which they are subjected at TCCY deprive Plaintiffs\nof the rights secured to them by the First, Fourth, Fifth,\nSixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States\nConstitution, as enforced by 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1401 et\nseq and regulations promulgated thereunder; Title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-\n12133 and regulations promulgated thereunder; Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and regulations promulgated\nthereunder (“Section 504\"); and various provisions of the\nLouisiana Constitution and Louisiana law.\nI. JURISDICTION\n4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28\nU.S.C. § 1343(3), this being an action to redress the\ndeprivation, under color of state law, of rights secured by the\nConstitution of the United States; the Civil Rights Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 1983; the IDEA; the ADA; and Section 504.\n5. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action\nunder 28 U.S.C. §1343(4), this being an action to secure\ndeclaratory, injunctive, and other equitable relief under Acts\nof Congress providing for the protection of civil rights,\nspecifically the Civil Rights Act, the IDEA, the ADA, and\nSection 504.\n6. This court also has jurisdiction over this action\n3\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (a), this being an action in which the\nmatter in controversy arises under the Constitution and laws of\nthe United States.\n7. This Court is authorized to grant declaratory and\ninjunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rules 57\nand 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n8. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367\nover Plaintiffs’ state law claims which are so related to the\nfederal claims in this action that they form a part of the same\ncase or controversy under the Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States.\nII. VENUE\n9. The Middle District of Louisiana is an appropriate\nvenue for this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) because all\nof the defendants reside in Louisiana and several of the\ndefendants have their business offices in this district.\nPursuant to existing court orders, it is appropriate for this\ncase to be before the Hon. Judge Frank J. Polozola for judicial\noversight.\nIII. PARTIES\nA. Plaintiffs\n10. Each of the named Plaintiffs is a citizen of the\nUnited States and is currently incarcerated at TCCY.

Defendant CITY OF TALLULAH (“City”) is a municipality\nin the State of Louisiana that is responsible for the\nconstruction and operation of TCCY, as set forth below.\nPursuant to agreement, the City is to provide routine health\ncare, including mental health and dental services, for youth at\n10\n\nTCCY.\n33. Defendant THEODORE LINDSAY is the Mayor of City of\nTallulah. As such, he has the authority and responsibility to\ncarry out decisions and official policies of the City, including\ncontracting with DPS&C and with Trans-American Development\nAssoc., Inc. regarding operation of, and confinement of youth\nin, TCCY. He is sued in his official capacity.\n34. Defendant TRANS-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT ASSOC., Inc.\n(“Trans-American”) is a Louisiana corporation and a private,\nfor-profit company. Its principal offices are located in the\nCity of Tallulah. Pursuant to agreement with the City, Trans-\nAmerican is responsible for providing programmatic services and\nhousing for youth at TCCY. These activities by Trans-American\nare traditionally performed by government and therefore are a\npublic function.\n35. Defendant JAMES R. BROWN is the President of and\nregistered agent for Trans-American; for the purposes of Trans-\nAmerican’s contract with the City, Defendant Brown is Trans-\nAmerican’s duly authorized representative.\n36.

CLASS ACTION\n37. The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of\nthemselves and all other persons who now are, or in the future\nwill be, held in custody at TCCY, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2).\n11\n\n38. The class of Plaintiffs is so numerous that joinder\nof all members is impracticable. TCCY holds approximately six\nhundred (600) youth. The population fluctuates almost daily as\nyouth are detained, committed, transferred, or released. During\nthe course of each year, Defendants confine over a thousand\nyouth at TCCY.\n39. There are questions of law and fact common to the\nclass. These include the factual circumstances and the legality\nand constitutionality of the conditions, policies, and practices\nunder which Defendants confine Plaintiffs at TCCY.\n40. Defendants impose the conditions, policies, and\npractices challenged in this action on the named Plaintiffs and\non the members of the Plaintiff class so that the claims of the\nnamed Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class.\n41. The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately\nrepresent the interests of the class. These Plaintiffs possess\nthe requisite personal interest in the subject matter of the\nlawsuit. They are represented by counsel experienced in class\naction litigation involving conditions of confinement.\n42. Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, and continue to do so,\nthereby making appropriate final declaratory and injunctive\nrelief with respect to the class as a whole.\n43. The injuries suffered by the named Plaintiffs and the\nmembers of the Plaintiff class are a result of the conditions,\npolicies, and practices of Defendants and are capable of\nrepetition, yet may evade review, thereby making class relief\nappropriate.\n44. Unless otherwise noted, in all following paragraphs\n12\n\nthe term “Plaintiffs” shall include the named Plaintiffs as well\nas members of the Plaintiff class.\nV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND -- PHYSICAL PLANT\nAND POPULATION AT TCCY\nA. Background\n45. In February, 1994, on behalf of the DPS&C, Defendant\nStalder entered into a cooperative endeavor agreement with the\nCity. The agreement required the City to construct or cause the\nconstruction of the TCCY facility. In return, DPS&C agreed to\nmaintain at all times a population of not less than 686\njuveniles at TCCY and to pay the City an average per diem, per\nyouth. The eighth amendment to the agreement, executed in\nJanuary, 1997, reaffirms the respective roles of DPS&C and the\nCity.\n46. In 1994, on behalf of the City, the Mayor entered\ninto a management services agreement with Defendant Trans-\nAmerican.\n47. In July, 1994, on behalf of Trans-American, Defendant\nJames R. Brown entered into a management agreement with GRW\nCorporation. The agreement set forth the terms and conditions\nunder which GRW would manage the facility on behalf of Trans-\nAmerican. Responsibilities of GRW for handling day-to-day\noperations and management included cooperating with Trans-\nAmerican, the City, and the DPS&C in order to maximize the\npopulation at TCCY and the revenues obtained in connection\ntherewith.\n48. In October, 1994, Defendants began sending youth to\nTCCY. Before the end of the year, a state of emergency was\ndeclared at TCCY and the state assumed operations.\n49. In June, 1995, on behalf of the City, Defendant\n13\n\nLindsay entered into an amended management agreement with Trans-\nAmerican. The agreement required Trans-American to construct or\ncause the construction of a facility to house a minimum of 714\nyouth. Pursuant to the agreement, Trans-American provides\nhousing and programmatic services at TCCY for each Plaintiff\nreferred by the DPS&C to the City, and bills the DPS&C an\naverage per diem per Plaintiff. Trans-American released GRW\nfrom the pre-existing management agreement and no longer\ncontracted with GRW.\n50. Pursuant to the agreement, Trans-American charges\nmore per day for each Plaintiff in Phase II (the more secure\nside of TCCY) than for each Plaintiff in Phase I.\n51. Pursuant to the agreement, the City provides all\nroutine health care, including dental and mental health care,\nfor Plaintiffs at TCCY. As consideration for the provision of\nthese services, Trans-American pays the City $150,000 per year,\nand has agreed to do so for 25 years.\nB. Physical Plant and Employees\n52. TCCY is located in the city of Tallulah, Madison\nParish, Louisiana. In October of 1994, Defendants DPS&C began\nsending youth to TCCY.\n53. TCCY consists of two areas: Phase I and Phase II.\nPhase I was designed as a Boot Camp (“LITE” Program) but also\nhouses juveniles who are not participating in Boot Camp. Phase\nI has nine dormitory-style open housing units, holding\napproximately forty beds (twenty bunk beds) per unit. These\ndormitories are named Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo,\nFoxtrot, Golf, Hotel, and India. Phase I includes a number of\nseparate, free standing buildings that contain classrooms, an\n14\n\ninfirmary, a limited number of cellblocks for disciplinary\npurposes, a control center, a maintenance building, and a\nmultipurpose building that contains a kitchen, dining hall, and\nlaundry. Phase I has a covered recreation area. The Phase I\ncampus is enclosed by a ten-foot tall fence reinforced with\nrazor wire and concertina wire. There are named Plaintiffs in\nPhase I.\n54. Phase II is a maximum security cellblock design.\nPhase II has four 80-cell cellblocks, divided into four\nsections, each with twenty individual cells. The four Phase II\ncellblocks are named: Java, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Montana.\nPhase II does not have its own kitchen; all meals are prepared\nin the kitchen in Phase I and transported to Phase II. Phase II\nhas a dining hall, a building that houses classrooms and offices\nfor TCCY’s counselors, an infirmary, a covered recreation area,\nan intake building, and a control center. The entire Phase II\nis enclosed by a twelve-foot tall double fence reinforced with\nconcertina wire. There are named Plaintiffs in Phase II.\nC. Population\n55. On information and belief, more than 300 Plaintiffs\nare held in Phase I and more than 200 are held in Phase II at\nTCCY.\n56. Defendants hold only male juveniles adjudicated\ndelinquent or in need of supervision at TCCY. Plaintiffs held\nat TCCY have varying histories of delinquency and court\nintervention.\n57. Defendants may hold Plaintiffs ranging in age from 10\nyears through 20 at TCCY.\n58. Defendants confine Plaintiffs at TCCY who have been\n15\n\nfound delinquent for offenses ranging from serious violent\ncrimes to non-violent drug and property offenses.\n59. DPS&C places youth under its custody, who are serving\nsentences under juvenile dispositions, at TCCY.\n60. There are four levels of security classification\nwithin TCCY: maximum, medium, minimum-in, and minimum-out.\nThese levels are in place for behavior modification purposes. A\n“staffing” is supposed to be held every three months to make\nrecommendations for increasing or decreasing a Plaintiff’s\ncustody level. Any Plaintiff who receives three or more\ndisciplinary citations (“tickets”) in a staffing period is\ngenerally not recommended for a less secure level of custody.\n61. In addition to the classification system, Phase II\nhas a behavior modification program referred to as “Stages.” In\nPhase II, Plaintiffs who receive disciplinary tickets are placed\nin isolation for up to 24 hours a day in stark and oppressively\nsmall cells, without education or counseling services.\nVI. VIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS -- EXCESSIVE FORCE\nAND UNREASONABLE BODILY RESTRAINT\nA. Excessive use of force by staff\n62. With Defendants’ knowledge, and pursuant to official\npolicy or custom, staff at TCCY routinely use excessive force by\nhitting, slapping, punching, kicking, shoving, choking, and\nacting out in other violent ways toward Plaintiffs.\n63. Staff at TCCY use excessive force maliciously and\nsadistically to cause physical and emotional harm to Plaintiffs.\n64. Staff at TCCY routinely use excessive force to stop\nor break up fights between Plaintiffs.\n65. When staff at TCCY use excessive force to break up a\nfight, they offer not to write a disciplinary ticket for\n16\n\nfighting in return for Plaintiffs not reporting the excessive\nuse of force to the administration.\n66. Defendants do not adequately investigate allegations\nof excessive use of force by staff on Plaintiffs, or violence\namong Plaintiffs. DPS&C instituted Project Zero Tolerance\n(“PZT”), a program purportedly designed to end violence at\njuvenile correctional facilities. Despite PZT, Defendants’\ninvestigations of excessive use of force are ineffective at best\nand non-existent for many violent episodes. Specifically, TCCY\nstaff who investigate allegations of excessive use of force lack\nsufficient experience and knowledge of appropriate correctional\npractices for youth to conduct thorough and complete\ninvestigations; routinely fail to follow-up on numerous\nallegations of abuse and situations which are inherently\nsuggestive of abuse; and routinely fail to properly report and\ndiscipline staff for abuse of Plaintiffs, coercion of witnesses,\nand filing of false reports in connection with such abuse.\n67. Defendants fail to provide an adequate monitoring\nsystem to ensure supervision and accountability of staff with\nrespect to excessive use of force. Specifically, as a result of\ncontinuing policies and practices, Defendants maintain a faulty\nelectronic surveillance system. While there are video cameras\nat TCCY, they are set up to monitor only in specific areas.\nStaff are familiar with the areas not monitored by cameras, and\nconsequently many abuses occur out of sight of the security\ncameras. In addition, Defendants have no system or procedure in\nplace for actually monitoring the cameras during their operation\nand reporting potential incidents of abuse or violence.\nFurther, Defendants use videotapes of such poor quality and\n17\n\ncondition that even where the cameras do capture some\ndisturbance, the documentation of the events on tape has very\nlittle investigative or evidentiary value, if any at all.\n68. Defendants fail to adequately protect Plaintiffs who\nreport staff abuse. Defendants inform staff who are the subject\nof investigations for abuse but do not remove them from contact\nwith Plaintiffs, including Plaintiffs who filed reports of\nabuse. Instead, staff place Plaintiffs who report abuse in\nsegregation, in effect punishing them for reporting the abuse.\nStaff at TCCY attempt to intimidate Plaintiffs from reporting\nabuse, and such intimidation is often successful. Some\nPlaintiffs refuse to even write out statements indicating abuse\nthey have witnessed out of fear of retaliation from staff.\nB. Arbitrary and punitive use of chemical\nand mechanical restraints\n69. With Defendants’ knowledge, and pursuant to official\npolicy and custom, staff at TCCY regularly use mace or pepper\nspray as threats and punishments for Plaintiffs. Staff walk\naround Plaintiffs shaking cans of mace or pepper spray in a\nmenacing manner, shouting out orders and threatening to spray\nPlaintiffs to deter behavior. Staff use spray canisters of mace\non Plaintiffs. Staff use mace or pepper spray to expedite the\nmovement of Plaintiffs into or out of their cells, to stop youth\nfrom banging on their cell doors, and for minor misbehavior such\nas cutting a corner as Plaintiffs walk to the mess hall. Staff\nuse of mace and pepper spray on Plaintiffs is excessive,\npunitive, painful, malicious, and sadistic.\n70. Staff at TCCY use handcuffs and shackles on\nPlaintiffs when such mechanical restraints are excessive,\nunreasonable, and unnecessary to protect Plaintiffs from injury\n18\n\nto themselves or to prevent injury to others. Staff routinely\nuse mechanical restraints in such a way as to cause discomfort\nand physical injury to Plaintiffs by intentionally or recklessly\nplacing handcuffs on too tight, causing painful bruising, cuts,\nscratches, and other physical harm to Plaintiffs. Defendants’\nuse of mechanical restraints constitutes unreasonable bodily\nrestraints on Plaintiffs.\nC. Arbitrary and punitive use of isolation\nand discipline\n71. Defendants regularly place Plaintiffs in isolation\nfor arbitrary reasons and for grossly excessive periods, and\nconstitute unreasonable bodily restraints on Plaintiffs.\nDefendants regularly place Plaintiffs in isolation for 22-23\nhours per day for weeks, and sometimes months, at a time.\n72. Defendants place Plaintiffs sent to isolation in\nlock-down cells which are oppressively small and stark.\nPlaintiffs must sleep on thin mattresses over metal slabs. The\nnoise levels are very high due to constant echoing throughout\nthe cellblock. Ventilation is poor during both summer and\nwinter months.\n73. As a result of continuing policies and practices,\nDefendants regularly place Plaintiffs in isolation solely as\npunishment, for the convenience of staff, or in some instances,\nas a substitute for therapeutic programming. Defendants do not\nhave a procedure by which qualified professionals determine the\nneed for isolation or the amount of time necessary for\nisolation. Defendants fail to use isolation only for instances\nwhere Plaintiffs pose an immediate threat to the health or\nsafety of themselves or others. Defendants fail to release\nPlaintiffs from isolation when they have demonstrated that they\n19\n\nare in control of themselves. Defendants fail to adequately\nmonitor Plaintiffs in isolation. Defendants fail to provide\nadequate education, counseling, recreation, or other\nrehabilitative treatment to Plaintiffs in isolation.\n74. Defendants’ use of the “Stages” program for behavior\ncontrol subjects Plaintiffs in Phase II to excessive punishment\nwith no reasonable rehabilitative goals or effects.\n75. Plaintiffs held in isolation experience extreme\nloneliness, anxiety, rage, and depression, among other\npotentially debilitating emotional and psychological problems.\nDefendants fail to ensure that prolonged use of isolation does\nnot have adverse psychological consequences on the children. As\na result of their continuing policies and practices of prolonged\nisolation, Defendants subject Plaintiffs to endure seemingly\nendless hours of mind-numbing solitude.\n76. Defendants subject Plaintiffs to an arbitrary and\npunitive disciplinary system.\n77. Staff at TCCY arbitrarily issue disciplinary\n“tickets” for minor or nonexistent behavior incidents. Staff\nroutinely give Plaintiffs tickets for “aggravated disobedience”\nor “defiance” for conduct such as laughing, horse-playing with\nother children, and simply asking questions.\n78. Defendants’ arbitrary practice of over-ticketing\nleads to excessive punishment for Plaintiffs, including\nincreased isolation. The practice is especially detrimental for\nPlaintiffs with mental illnesses or learning disabilities.\nDefendants’ failure to adequately train and supervise staff to\nrespond in appropriate ways to Plaintiffs with mental illnesses\nand mental retardation results in excessive ticketing for such\n20\n\nPlaintiffs.\n79. Defendants’ practice of over-ticketing also\nsignificantly limits opportunities for Plaintiffs for early\nrelease. For example, Plaintiffs in the Boot Camp receive early\nrelease if they successfully complete the three-month program.\n“Successfully completing” the program means not receiving any\ndisciplinary tickets. A single disciplinary ticket, however,\ncan result in a Plaintiff having to serve out his entire\nsentence, and Defendants’ practice of over-ticketing makes it\nvery difficult for Plaintiffs to “successfully complete” the\nprogram.\n80. Plaintiffs with mental illnesses, mental retardation\nor other disabilities are less capable than non-disabled\nPlaintiffs of responding to Defendants’ disciplinary practices\nand policies in ways acceptable to Defendants. Defendants\nsubject such disabled Plaintiffs to particular injury by\nrepeatedly sending them to isolation and keeping them confined\nin the more restrictive Phase II. Defendants fail to exclude\nPlaintiffs with mental illness and other disorders from the\nprolonged use of isolation, even when such Plaintiffs are unable\nto comply with Defendants’ demands. Excessive isolation and the\narbitrary and punitive use of chemical and mechanical restraints\nare particularly harmful for Plaintiffs with mental illnesses,\nand cause the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain on these\nPlaintiffs.\nD. Abusive and demeaning practices\n81. Staff at TCCY place “hits” on Plaintiffs whom staff\nwant to punish without performing the actual physical assault\nthemselves. Staff “hire” youth by providing them with food,\n21\n\ngiving them contraband such as cigarettes and marijuana,\ngranting them extra privileges, and by creating other incentives\nfor children to beat up or harass Plaintiffs.\n82. Staff constantly yell, curse, and berate Plaintiffs.\nStaff rarely call Plaintiffs by their name. Staff yell out\nracial epithets in conjunction with curse words when referring\nto Plaintiffs.\n83. Staff maliciously and sadistically abuse their\nauthority over Plaintiffs by forcing them to perform demeaning\nand cruel activities, such as requiring Plaintiffs to place\ntheir foreheads on a desk and remain in that position for hours\nat a time. Another common abuse of authority is forcing youth\nto stand en masse outside in the hot sun.\n84. Staff sexually abuse youth in their care by, inter\nalia, engaging in sexual relations with youth.\n85. Defendants repeatedly subject Plaintiffs to strip\nsearches with little or no justification.\nE. Failure to protect from harm\n86. Defendants fail to provide adequate staffing levels\nin TCCY’s living areas, thereby endangering the safety and\nsecurity of Plaintiffs. Defendants demonstrate conscious or\ncallous indifference to the safety of Plaintiffs. Defendants\nprovide only two guards to monitor each dormitory of forty\nyouth, which is inadequate to protect Plaintiffs from risk of\nharm. Guards regularly fall asleep on duty and fail to provide\nsupervision and protection to Plaintiffs.\n87. Defendants fail to adequately classify Plaintiffs\naccording to legitimate security and safety needs.\nConsequently, Defendants do not identify and separate aggressive\n22\n\nyouth from potential victims.\n88. Defendants fail to protect Plaintiffs from violence\ncaused by other youth. Guards allow, and encourage, youth to\nfight one another. Guards engage in a practice referred to as\nopening “the cut”, whereby youth are permitted to physically\nfight one another. As a result, Plaintiffs suffer considerable\ninjuries, such as swollen jaws, swollen noses, sprained wrists,\nswollen hands, bruised eyes, lacerations, and hematomas that\nrequire medical treatment.\n89. Defendants fail to protect Plaintiffs from being\n“snuck” (attacked by surprise) by other youth. As a result,\nPlaintiffs suffer considerable injuries.\n90. Defendants endanger Plaintiffs by inadequately\nscreening and paying the staff they hire; inadequately training\nstaff for their custody and care duties and instead focusing on\nthe use of force, restraints, and pressure points as methods of\ncontrolling Plaintiffs; and by inadequately supervising staff at\nTCCY.\nF. Failure to adequately train and supervise staff\n91. Defendants fail to adequately train and supervise\nstaff at TCCY and Plaintiffs are directly injured as a\nconsequence. Because the need for more and different staff\ntraining is so obvious, and the inadequacy of such training\nresults in the violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights,\nDefendants’ failure to provide such training amounts to\ndeliberate indifference.\nVII. VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS -- DENIAL OF\nBASIC NEEDS AND SERVICES\nA. Inadequate mental health care\n92. Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the\n23\n\nserious mental health needs of youth confined at TCCY.\n93. Defendants fail to conduct or provide adequate\npsychological assessments of Plaintiffs upon admission to TCCY.\nThe result is that Plaintiffs who are mentally ill, mentally\nretarded, developmentally disabled, or otherwise mentally\ndisabled, are incarcerated at TCCY with inadequate mental health\ncare.\n94. Defendants deny access to medical or mental health\npractitioners qualified to address the mental health problems of\nPlaintiffs by failing to employ a sufficient number of qualified\npsychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers to counsel and\ntreat Plaintiffs. Although Defendants contract with a private\npsychiatrist to monitor medications, Def0endants fail to provide\nany individualized psychiatric treatment, counseling, or\npsychotherapy to Plaintiffs in need of such services.\nDefendants also fail to provide adequate or effective group\ncounseling by trained staff. TCCY staff conduct minimal group\ndiscussions where the following topics are addressed: anger-\nmanagement, victim awareness, life skills, and substance abuse\neducation. However, the counselors are not trained or certified\nto teach in any of these areas. Defendants fail to adequately\ntrain and supervise TCCY staff to care for youth with mental\nhealth needs. As a result of these failures, Plaintiffs do not\nreceive necessary mental health treatment.\n95. Defendants fail to design and implement an adequate\ntreatment plan for Plaintiffs with mental illness. Defendants’\nfailure to develop coordinated clinical care and failure to\nprovide Plaintiffs with comprehensive and appropriate\nrehabilitative treatment causes Plaintiffs to suffer physical\n24\n\nand psychological harm.\n96. Defendants fail to provide adequate mental health\nconsultation or treatment for Plaintiffs who are suicidal or\nhomicidal, or Plaintiffs held in isolation. Defendants fail to\ntake preventative steps to ensure TCCY’s physical structures\n(such as rails in dorms) are sufficiently safe, to prevent\nsuicide attempts by Plaintiffs with mental illness.\n97. Defendants’ failure to provide necessary training and\nsupervision to adequately handle Plaintiffs who are mentally ill\nor mentally retarded impacts Plaintiffs’ ability to participate\nfully in treatment and behavior modification programs.\nB. Inadequate medical care\n98. Defendants fail to provide youth with adequate\nmedical care and emergency treatment, and demonstrate deliberate\nindifference to the serious medical and dental needs of\nPlaintiffs.\n99. TCCY operates infirmaries in both Phase I and Phase\nII. On information and belief, the infirmaries are supervised\nby a Registered Nurse and include a staff of two additional RNs\nand 21 LPNs for all of TCCY. A medical doctor is on site only\nnine (9) hours a week. The doctor does not meet regularly with\nother health care providers in order to provide consultation on\ntreatment, use of medications, or follow-up care.\n100. The infirmaries are closed on a regular basis due to\ninsufficient staff. As a result, Plaintiffs do not receive\nprompt medical care. Instead, TCCY staff move sick, injured,\nand suicidal Plaintiffs to segregated isolation cells without\nany medical treatment.\n101. Defendants fail to provide youth at TCCY with prompt\n25\n\nmedical care due to significant delays in receiving lab reports\nand other vital medical records, as well as fail to conduct\nregular reviews of these records once they do arrive.\nPlaintiffs confined in the Boot Camp are particularly at risk of\nharm where undetected medical afflictions are adversely affected\nby the rigorous exercise regimen.\n102. TCCY staff do not distribute medications as\nprescribed. Staff dispense medications three times a day;\nhowever, they do not adequately monitor Plaintiffs to ensure\nthat they receive the proper dosage and that Plaintiffs follow\ntheir treatment regimen.\n103. Defendants do not provide adequate training to TCCY\nstaff to recognize or to respond to health problems, including\nsituations requiring first aid, mental illness, substance abuse,\nand suicidal tendencies.\n104. Defendants’ disciplinary customs and policies prevent\nPlaintiffs from receiving adequate preventative medical care by\ndiscouraging Plaintiffs from reporting illnesses. Plaintiffs\nwith painful headaches, nausea, stomach aches, tooth aches, and\nother ailments must complete a medical care request. However,\nhealth care providers examining Plaintiffs issue tickets for\n“malingering” if they are unable to detect a problem.\nConsequently, Plaintiffs are reluctant to seek treatment, and\noften do not seek medical assistance until a condition has\nworsened, to their physical and psychological detriment.\n106. Defendants fail to provide Plaintiffs with adequate\nvision and hearing treatment. Defendants fail to provide\nregular examinations. When Plaintiffs do receive examinations,\nTCCY staff fail to follow recommendations for follow-up\n26\n\ntreatment.\n107. Defendants fail to provide Plaintiffs with any\npreventive dental treatment. Defendants fail to provide annual\nexams, and respond to Plaintiffs complaints of toothaches and\nother dental problems with only a dose of Tylenol. The only\nformal dental care provided, regardless of need and standard\npractice within the dental profession, is extraction.\nC. Inadequate food\n108. Defendants fail to ensure that Plaintiffs receive an\nadequate diet with sufficient nutritional value to preserve\nhealth. The lack of nutritional meals is particularly injurious\nfor the physical and mental development of adolescents such as\nPlaintiffs.\n109. Defendants fail to provide Plaintiffs with fresh\nfruit or fresh vegetables on a regular basis. Defendants only\nprovide Plaintiffs with one portion of milk a day. Plaintiffs\nregularly find pebbles, hair, bugs and other non-food substances\nin their meals.\n110. Plaintiffs lose weight during their custody at TCCY,\nin part because they receive grossly deficient amounts of\nnutritional food in their meals. Defendants provide Plaintiffs\nwith meals three times per day and a snack in the evening, but\nthe portions are meager and Defendants do not allow second\nhelpings. Plaintiffs are often hungry.\nD. Lack of basic privacy for toilet and shower\n111. In Phase I, Defendants fail to provide Plaintiffs\nwith privacy during use of bathroom facilities. The dormitory\nis generally configured as one large room with a set of twenty\nbunk beds to the right, several tables and seats secured to the\n27\n\nfloor to the left, and the guard area and bathroom/showers\nstraight to one side of the back. The set of shower stalls\nopens directly into the main dormitory. Therefore, Plaintiffs\nmust shower, use the toilet facilities, and complete their\nhygiene in front of others in the dormitory.\nE. Excessive heat\n112. Defendants fail to maintain the temperature in the\ndormitories for Plaintiffs at a reasonable level. Defendants\nfail to provide any effective system for cooling in the summer\nmonths. During the summer, the heat is stifling. As a result,\nPlaintiffs experience extreme discomfort. The heat also\nincreases the tension level in the dormitories, contributing to\na corresponding increase in the incidents of violence involving\nPlaintiffs.\nF. Lack of basic sanitation\n113. Defendants fail to provide sanitary facilities.\nToilets, showers, sinks, and the remainder of the dormitories\nare not adequately cleaned or disinfected on a regular basis.\n114. Defendants fail to adequately control vermin. TCCY\nis infested with vermin, making the facility unsanitary and\nendangering Plaintiffs health and well-being. Mosquitoes make\nit impossible for Plaintiffs to get adequate sleep. Plaintiffs\nroutinely find insects in their food.\n115. Defendants do not provide Plaintiffs with adequate\npersonal hygiene items such as toothbrushes and toothpaste,\nshampoo, or hair brushes. Defendants do not provide deodorant\nto Plaintiffs. Consequently, Plaintiffs’ clothing becomes\nsmelly and filthy almost immediately.\n116. Defendants fail to provide Plaintiffs with adequate\n28\n\nclothing and shoes. Consequently, Plaintiffs must regularly\nwear dirty and worn clothes, and Plaintiffs must often wear the\nsame T-shirts and pants for more than a week.\n117. Defendants fail to provide adequate laundry services\nfor Plaintiffs’ clothing, and laundered clothes often return\nfilthier than they were before being cleaned. The lack of clean\nclothes often leads to fighting among Plaintiffs: some steal\nothers’ clean clothes, even those that do not fit properly.\nThose Plaintiffs unwilling to fight generally have the most worn\nand filthy clothing.\nVIII. VIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS --\nINADEQUATE PROGRAMMING\nA. Inadequate regular and vocational education\n118. Defendants do not provide youth with adequate,\nappropriate, individualized academic and vocational education.\n119. Defendants place Plaintiffs who receive education in\none of four basic categories of instruction: Basic Skills I,\nBasic Skills II, Pre-GED, or GED. Defendants fail to provide\nindividualized assessments for Plaintiffs or to properly\nclassify and place Plaintiffs in the education categories.\n120. Defendants fail to provide appropriate learning\nenvironments and require teachers to teach and Plaintiffs to\nstudy in overcrowded classrooms.\n121. Defendants exceed the state-required student teacher\nratio minimum of 15 to 1.\n122. Defendants fail to provide sufficiently qualified\nteachers. On information and belief, less than twenty percent\nof the teachers employed at the school meet the state\nqualifications for regular teacher certification.\n123. Defendants fail to ensure that the curriculum meets\n29\n\nminimum state standards for curriculum development.\n124. Defendants fail to provide teachers with adequate\ntraining and supervision in working with special populations,\nsuch as incarcerated youth.\n125. Defendants fail to meet state requirements for a\nminimum number of minutes of instruction per day. Plaintiffs\ncurrently are scheduled to receive 240 minutes of instruction\nper day, but receive far less. Indeed, the last hour of class\nis not a course of instruction but rather a “homeroom” type\nperiod. The 240-minute allotment is further reduced by\nabsenteeism, tardiness, and early class dismissals by guards\nfailing to bring Plaintiffs to class on time and teachers\nexcusing class early.\n126. Defendants fail to ensure adequate instruction for\nPlaintiffs in isolation. Assignments and instruction for\nPlaintiffs is haphazard, classes are often less than the minimum\nrequirement, classes are often canceled, worksheets are\ndistributed but no teaching assistance is provided.\n127. Defendants provide only 60 minutes of instruction to\nyouth placed on “Stage 1” isolation.\n128. Defendants fail to provide Plaintiffs with adequate\npre-vocational and vocational training, such as carpentry,\nwelding, electrical wiring, plumbing, computer electronics, or\nother skilled or useful trades. Some TCCY youth participate in\nwork detail; however, these tasks consist primarily of cleaning\nthe buildings, maintaining the grounds, and washing staff\nvehicles, and the level of work is not adequate for employment\npreparation.\nB. Inadequate special education for disabled students\n30\n\n129. Defendants fail to develop and implement policies and\nprocedures to assure that all educationally disabled Plaintiffs\nup to twenty-one years of age have access to a free and\nappropriate public education, including related and transition\nservices, in accordance with the I.D.E.A. and state statutory\nrequirements.\n130. Defendants fail to adequately identify, screen, and\nassess Plaintiffs to determine whether they have special needs\nand how such special needs can be met.\n131. Defendants fail to develop Individual Educational\nPrograms (IEPs) for all Plaintiffs with exceptionalities, or\nprovide inadequate IEPs. For Plaintiffs who do have IEPs,\nDefendants fail to provide the services specified in the IEPs.\n132. Defendants have failed to maintain records of the\nIEPs and their implementation for each youth in custody\nreceiving special education services so that IEPs can be\nreviewed and, when necessary, revised.\n133. Defendants have failed to provide a sufficient number\nof qualified special education, related services, and transition\nservices personnel at the TCCY school to guarantee that all\nyouth in custody eligible for special education receive a free\nand appropriate public education.\n134. Defendants have failed to assure parental involvement\nor to appoint surrogate parents in the development of IEPs.\n135. Defendants have failed to implement any system for\nnotifying Plaintiffs of the availability of, and their potential\neligibility for, special education and related services and\ntransition services, as well as procedures by which they can\nexercise their right to such services and contest any\n31\n\ndeprivation of such right.\n136. Defendants deny Plaintiffs all of the appropriate\nspecial education, related services, and transition services for\nwhich they are both eligible and in need.\n137. Defendants fail to provide sufficient hours of\nspecial education instruction, as determined by a youth’s IEP.\nOn information and belief, provision of special education\nclasses is limited to approximately one to two hours per day.\nC. Inadequate exercise and recreation\n138. Defendants provide inadequate exercise and\nrecreation, particularly on the weekends when TCCY staff set\narbitrary limits on Plaintiffs’ opportunities to participate in\noutdoor activities. Many Plaintiffs sit or lie idle in their\ndorms all day.\nD. Inadequate rehabilitative programming\n139. Defendants fail to provide adequate rehabilitative\ntreatment and intervention to Plaintiffs. Despite a high\nincidence of specific rehabilitative needs among Plaintiffs,\nDefendants fail to provide individualized counseling services,\ntherapeutic substance abuse treatment (as opposed to a purely\neducational program on substance abuse), family counseling or\nintervention to promote the stability of the family, sexual\nvictimization or sexual offender treatment, or transitional\nservices or after-care.\nIX. VIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS -- DENIAL OF\nACCESS TO THE COURTS AND TO FAMILY\n140. Defendants deny meaningful access to the courts by\nfailing to provide youth with access to a law library or\nassistance from a person trained in the law. The majority of\nPlaintiffs have a right to petition the Juvenile Court for an\n32\n\nearly release. Without meaningful access to the courts, such a\nright is illusory and Plaintiffs are denied early release.\n141. Defendants’ improperly restrict Plaintiffs’ access to\nthe courts in other ways. For example, Defendants do not allow\na youth to call an attorney unless the attorney’s phone number\nis on the youth’s calling list. However, Defendants\nunreasonably delay placing attorneys’ phone numbers on\nPlaintiffs’ calling lists, thereby depriving access to counsel.\nIn addition, all phone calls are recorded, eviscerating\nPlaintiffs’ right to confidential communications with counsel.\nFinally, staff interfere with Plaintiffs’ access to the courts\nby improperly questioning Plaintiffs when Plaintiffs meet with\ntheir counsel and making derogatory comments about Plaintiffs’\ncounsel.\n142. Defendants unreasonably restrict Plaintiffs’ ability\nto maintain contact with their families. The remote location of\nTCCY places unreasonable and unnecessary burdens on Plaintiffs\nand their families, particularly in terms of the expense of\ntelephone calls (which must be made collect) and the difficulty\nof visitation. Defendants make no provisions to assist families\nto visit Plaintiffs regularly. When Plaintiffs’ families are\nable to visit, Defendants unreasonably limit the number of\nvisitors Plaintiffs may have and the hours during which visits\nmay occur.\nX. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES\n143. All of the named Plaintiffs have exhausted\nadministrative remedies to the extent that they are required to\ndo so.\n144. Plaintiffs are not required to exhaust administrative\n33\n\nremedies. Defendants failed to adhere to the requirements of\ntheir own Administrative Remedy Procedure by not responding to\nPlaintiffs’ requests for administrative remedies within the\nforty (40) days required by the DPS&C regulations.\n145. In this matter, exhaustion of administrative remedies\nwould be inadequate and futile because there is no remedy\navailable that can address Plaintiffs’ allegations of denial of\ntheir civil and constitutional rights by Defendants, as alleged\nherein, within a reasonable period of time, and no remedy that\ncan provide meaningful relief. This is particularly true where,\nas here, the claims are brought on behalf of a class of\nsignificant size, and Plaintiffs seek classwide relief.\n146. In addition, exhaustion of administrative remedies\nwould be inadequate and futile because it would be futile as a\nlegal and practical matter to use the administrative process; it\nis improbable that adequate relief can be obtained by pursuing\nthe administrative process; government agencies have adopted\npolicies and pursued practices of general applicability that are\ncontrary to the law; and the agencies have failed to give\nPlaintiffs adequate notice of their rights under the law.\n147. Further, administrative remedies are not effectively\navailable to Plaintiffs. DPS&C’s Administrative Remedy\nProcedure (“ARP”) is too complex for Plaintiffs not represented\nby counsel, given the low maturity and educational level of\nmembers of the Plaintiff Class. Moreover, Defendants do not\nprovide posted notice of the ARP’s existence in a manner readily\naccessible to youth, as required by the ARP. Defendants do not\nprovide any assistance from a “classification officer” or\n“inmate counsel substitute.”\n34\n\n148. On information and belief, Defendants fail to provide\nnotice to Plaintiffs of the availability of and potential\neligibility for special education and related services.\nFurthermore, Defendants fail to provide notice and opportunities\nto use administrative procedures by which Plaintiffs can\nexercise their right to such services and contest their\ndeprivation of such right under the IDEA and corresponding state\nstatutes and regulations.\n149. Administrative remedies are also not effectively\navailable to Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs have a well-founded\nfear of retaliation by guards at TCCY if they file any\nadministrative action. As previously alleged, guards physically\nand verbally abuse Plaintiffs, and many incidents of abuse go\nunreported due to a legitimate fear of retaliation.\n150. Administrative remedies are also unavailable because\nthe majority of Plaintiffs are under the age of seventeen (17)\nand do not, under Louisiana law, have the legal capacity to seek\nredress.\nXI. NECESSITY FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;\nNO ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW\n151. Defendants have acted and continue to act in\nviolation of the law, as described herein. Plaintiffs do not\nhave an adequate remedy at law. As a proximate result of the\npolicies, practices, acts, and omissions of Defendants,\nPlaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer serious and\nirreparable physical, psychological, mental, and emotional\ninjuries. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or complete\nremedy at law to redress the wrongs described herein.\nDefendants have acted and continue to act in violation of the\nlaw, and Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable injuries\n35\n\nfrom the conditions of confinement at TCCY and Defendants’\npolicies, practices, acts, and omissions unless this Court\ngrants the injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs.\nXII. KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEFENDANTS\n152. Defendants are aware of the unlawful and\nunconstitutional conditions and the risks of irreparable harm to\nPlaintiffs enumerated above. Despite Defendants’ knowledge,\nthey are deliberately indifferent to those unconstitutional\nconditions and the risk of irreparable harm.\nXIII. CAUSES OF ACTION\n153. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference all of\nthe above factual allegations in paragraphs 1 to 152 to support\nthe following claims:\nCount I\n154. The conditions of confinement at TCCY and\nDefendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions complained\nof herein, constitute punishment and subject Plaintiffs to\ndenial of due process of law, in violation of Plaintiffs’\nconstitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution.\nCount II\n155. The conditions of confinement at TCCY and\nDefendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions complained\nof herein, are a substantial departure from accepted\nprofessional judgment, standards, and policies, and thereby\nsubject Plaintiffs to denial of due process of law, in violation\nof Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.\nCount III\n36\n\n156. The conditions of confinement at TCCY and\nDefendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions complained\nof herein, violate Plaintiffs rights to freedom of speech and\nassociation, privacy, and meaningful access to the courts and\ncounsel, in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the First,\nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\nCount IV\n157. The conditions of confinement at TCCY and\nDefendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions complained\nof herein, and Defendants’ deliberate indifference to those\nconditions and their policies and practices in administering and\noverseeing TCCY, constitute cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights under the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nCount V\n158. Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions\ncomplained of herein, and in particular Defendants’ failure to\nprovide adequate special education and related services, deprive\nPlaintiffs of their rights under the IDEA and Section 504.\nCount VI\n159. Defendants policies, practices, acts, and omissions\ncomplained of herein, and in particular Defendants’ failure to\nprovide adequate psychological assessments, care, and treatment\nto Plaintiffs with mental illness, mental retardation, and other\ndisabilities, discriminates against Plaintiffs and punishes them\nsolely by reason of their disability, in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution, Section 504, and the ADA.\n37\n\nState Pendent Claims\n160. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all of the\nfactual allegations in paragraph 1 through 152 as they apply to\ndefendants Madison Parish School Board, Samuel Dixon, City of\nTallulah, Theodore Lindsay, Trans-American Development Assoc.,\nInc., and James R.

that staff use such mechanical restraints only so\nlong as the individual Plaintiffs are out of control, and staff\nremove the restraints as soon as the individual Plaintiffs are\nback in control or are returned to their rooms; that staff may\nuse mechanical restraints for security purposes in moving\n40\n\nindividual Plaintiffs from one area of TCCY to another or for\nmoving Plaintiffs to locations outside of TCCY such as\nhospitals;
