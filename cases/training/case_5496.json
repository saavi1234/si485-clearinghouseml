    "summary": "<p>On April 17, 1978, two citizens of Massachusetts filed lawsuits under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1977 against the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The plaintiffs, represented by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), alleged that their constitutional rights had been violated by racially discriminatory disbursement of federal housing funds in the cities of Boston and Chelsea.</p><p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Judge Walter J. Skinner) dismissed for lack of standing the portion of each complaint relating to Urban Development Action Grant funding and entered partial judgment for the defendants under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).  The plaintiffs appealed.</p><p>On October 18, 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Judge Levin H. Campbell) partially affirmed and partially reversed the district court's dismissal for lack of standing, holding that black residents of minority neighborhoods who were elected members of the state legislature did not have standing, but that black persons living in substandard housing in a segregated area of the city during the years in question did have standing to sue for declaratory and injunctive relief.  N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514 (1st Cir. 1979).  </p><p>On January 23, 1981, the district court (Judge Skinner) denied the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction.   N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. Harris, No.78-850, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10552 (D.Mass. 1981).  On April 27, 1983, the district court held that 1) individual plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain the action; 2) that the organization representing the city's black citizens had standing in its own right to maintain the action; 3) that the evidence did not warrant a finding that HUD financed city programs that were either intentionally discriminatory or had discriminatory impact; but 4) that HUD did not satisfy minimum levels of compliance with the provisions of 42 U.S.C. §3608, which provided for full implementation of the fair housing policy.  N.A.A.C.P.  v. Harris, 567 F.Supp. 637 (D.Mass. 1983).</p><p>After claiming to have brought its actions into compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1968, HUD asked the district court to dismiss the case.  On December 31, 1985, the district court (Judge Skinner) granted the motion to dismiss, holding that he had no jurisdiction to review HUD's administration of the Fair Housing Act.  N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. Pierce, 624 F.Supp. 1083 (D.Mass. 1985).  The plaintiffs appealed.  On March 19, 1987, the First Circuit vacated the district court's dismissal of the case and reversed, holding that the federal courts did have jurisdiction.  N.A.A.C.P. v. Secretary of Housing & Urban Dev., 817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1987).</p><p>On July 4, 1987, the district court (Judge Skinner) stayed the action and ordered the parties to participate in mediation.  On December 14, 1988, the parties reported that their attempts to reach a resolution through mediation had failed.  On June 23, 1989, the district court granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, holding that the defendants had failed to comply with the minimal requirements of 42 U.S.C. §3608(e)(5) by failing to 1) promulgate regulations and guidelines setting forth standards for HUD's administration and recipients' use of funds, 2) secure a minority needs assessment in a timely manner, 3) finance the increase of desegregated housing stock to give minority families meaningful choice of location, and 4) require effective fair housing enforcement by the City of Boston.  N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp. 361 (D.Mass. 1989).  The court supplemented this decision with a final decree providing for fair housing funding, monitoring, and reporting to the court.  N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp. 361 (D.Mass. 1989).  The defendants asked the court to clarify its obligations under the decree, and on September 14, 1989, the district court amended the final decree to clarify HUD's obligations.  N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp. 361 (D.Mass. 1989).  </p><p>The defendants were not happy about the district court's order. Rather than appeal, they worked out a consent decree with the plaintiffs. Under the consent decree, HUD agreed to subsidize 500 Section 8 vouchers, most of which BHA was to administer. The vouchers were designed to allow minority families to move into white neighborhoods. The court entered the consent decree in 1991. </p><p>The docket was closed from 1991 to 1995, but then reopened, and the decree was modified by agreement in 1997. On September 30, 1999, the court again \"closed\" the case--but apparently, again, for docket management purposes only; status reports and other events continue to be noted in the docket.  On May 23, 2005, the NAACP asked the court to enforce the consent decree; on November 9, 2005, the district court (Judge Douglas P. Woodlock) re-opened discovery on the issue. On January 19, 2006, the court denied the NAACP's motion without prejudice pending further factual development. On November 15, 2006, the NAACP filed its a supplemental complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from HUD for breach of its obligations pursuant to the modified consent decree, and from HUD, BHA, and the City for breach of their obligations pursuant to the Modification Agreement.</p><p>On March 17, 2009, the court 1) denied HUD's motion for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, suggestion to the court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, 2) denied the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings but granted its motion for summary judgment, 3) denied NAACP's motion for summary judgment as to all of its claims against all of the defendants, 4) granted BHA's motion for summary judgment as to NAACP's supplemental complaint, but denied BHA's Motion for summary judgment as to its counterclaim against NAACP, and 5) granted summary judgment sua sponte to HUD as to NAACP's supplemental complaint, and to NAACP as to BHA's counterclaim. The court then entered judgment for the defendants on all counts. N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. HUD, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24346 (D.Mass 2009). </p><p>Nothing of substance has appeared on the docket since 2009, but the entry of a minor administrative order in 2014 suggests that the consent decree remains in force. </p><p></p>",

Harrington, U.S. Atty.,\nBoston, Mass., was on brief, for defendants, appellees.\n[*]\nBefore CAMPBELL and BOWNES, Circuit Judges, and DEVINE,  District Judge.\nLEVIN H. CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.\nPlaintiffs brought these two civil rights actions against officials of the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD) challenging the disbursement of federal funds to the cities of Boston and Chelsea,\nMassachusetts, and seeking conditions to assure that any funds provided be used in a non-discriminatory\nmanner. Plaintiffs maintain that HUD's actions with respect to the cities' requests for money under the Community\nDevelopment Block Grant (CDBG) program, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5301-5317, and the Urban Development Action Grant\n(UDAG) program, 42 U.S.C. § 5318, violate HUD's duty to ensure minorities equal access to the benefits of\nfunded projects. The district court dismissed for lack of standing the portion of each complaint relating to UDAG\n[1]\nfunds  and entered partial judgments for the defendants under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). These appeals followed.\nThe Housing and Community Development Act of 1977 established a new program 00 UDAG 00 for funneling\n97 97\nfederal dollars to the nation's hard-pressed cities. The Act authorizes annual funding of $400 million for three\nyears. Cities submit project proposals to HUD designed to \"take advantage of unique opportunities to attract\nprivate investment, stimulate investment in restoration of deteriorated or abandoned housing stock, or solve\ncritical problems resulting from loss of employment or chronic unemployment in the community.\" H.R.Rep. No.\n95-236, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 9, reprinted in\n[1977] U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, pp. 2884, 2892. Projects are expected to combine public and private\nresources.\nThe Act provides that only municipalities \"that have, in the determination of the Secretary, demonstrated results\"\nin housing low and moderate income citizens and in providing equal opportunity for minorities are eligible for\nUDAG funds. 42 U.S.C. § 5318(b). The Secretary is not required to fund all the proposals submitted by eligible\ncities. The Act instructs the Secretary to select projects on the basis of at least nine criteria, with primary focus on\nthe comparative degree of physical or economic distress of applicant cities. § 5318(e). HUD itself has\n\n517 promulgated regulations concerning *517 eligibility of applicants, 24 C.F.R. § 570.452, and criteria for selection of\nprojects, 24 C.F.R. § 570.457.\n1. The Boston Grants\nShortly after passage of the 1977 Act, Boston submitted an application for $27.46 million for four proposed\nprojects: the Charlestown shipyard, the South Boston industrial park, Lafayette Place downtown, and Blue Hill\nAvenue in Roxbury. It is alleged in the complaint that HUD received a report in February 1978 from the\n[2]\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD)  recommending that HUD not approve the UDAG\nproposals without imposing \"specific conditions\" relating to equal employment and housing. In March, two public\ninterest groups, including cocounsel in the present case, filed an administrative complaint challenging HUD's\ndetermination that Boston was eligible for funds as a city that had \"demonstrated results\" in providing\nopportunities to minority group members.\nOn April 6, 1978 HUD informed Boston that it had approved $2.48 million for Charlestown and $8 million for\n[3]\nLafayette Place.  As indicated in the affidavit of Margaret B. Sowell, deputy director of HUD's UDAG office,\nactual funding was contingent on HUD and Boston entering into a formal contract called a Funding Approval,\ncontaining the terms and conditions HUD intended to place on the funds. The record does not establish what\nconditions HUD actually imposed, but Sowell's affidavit states that HUD intended to require \"at a minimum,\" firm\ncommitments from private investors, environmental clearances, a legal opinion that private investor commitments\nwere binding, and a compliance schedule for performance. See 24 C.F.R § 570.458(c). There is no indication\nHUD contemplated imposing any conditions relating to equal opportunity or affirmative action.\nOn April 17, 1978 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and nine black\nresidents of Boston filed this suit in the district court, complaining that HUD's approval of the UDAG projects,\n[4]\ntogether with its actions regarding the CDBG program, violated the plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional rights.\nPlaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order was denied on August 3, 1978. The district court found with\n[5]\nregard to the UDAG funds that plaintiffs probably lacked standing.  An essential requirement of Article III, the\ncourt said, is that the remedy requested by the plaintiff be one that is likely to redress the asserted injury. Since\nthe granting of UDAG funds is supposedly conditioned on a city's past performance in providing equal\nopportunity, acceptance of plaintiffs' allegations would preclude redress. \"If this court were to grant the relief\nrequested, the city of Boston would be denied UDAG funds at the present time and it is purely speculative that\nplaintiffs and other Boston residents would materially benefit from these UDAG funds in the future,\" the court\n518 stated. Subsequently, on January 2, 1979 the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss \"so much of \n*518 the complaint as seeks relief with respect to the release of UDAG funds,\" stating:\n\"In my opinion, the plaintiffs do not have standing, for the reasons stated in my denial of the\nmotion for a temporary restraining order. While, as plaintiff says, the defendants could, and\npossibly should have, conditioned the grant on the enforcement of nondiscriminatory employment\npractices in the several projects, this is not a statutory condition of the grant.\"\n2. The Chelsea Grants\nThe city of Chelsea applied for $12.73 million in UDAG funds in February 1978. The city's proposal called for\nrenovation of the former Chelsea Naval Hospital site, including construction of luxury housing by a private\ndeveloper and of subsidized low-income housing for the elderly. This proposal was reviewed by the\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, see note 2 supra, which recommended conditional approval\nsubject to imposition of specific equal opportunity conditions. In particular, MCAD suggested Chelsea should be\nrequired to provide more low-income housing for younger families, in light of the high proportion of minorities\namong the nonelderly population. 1978 HUD informed Chelsea's mayor that the city had been found eligible for\nUDAG funds. Plaintiffs allege that on August 1, 1978 00 although plaintiffs' administrative complaint and the\n97\nMCAD review were still pending 00 HUD unconditionally approved Chelsea's amended application for $6.7 million.\n97\n\nLatinos Unidos de Chelsea En Accion, Inc. (LUCHA), a group representing Hispanic residents of Chelsea, and\nfour individual Hispanic residents filed suit in the district court on October 18, 1978, to challenge HUD's approval\nof the UDAG application, and its actions regarding Chelsea's CDBG funding. On February 22, 1979 the district\ncourt denied plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order and dismissed the UDAG claim altogether,\nreferring to its earlier decision in NAACP v. Harris. As in NAACP, the district court entered partial judgment under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), permitting immediate appeal in this court.\nI.\nThese appeals present the narrow issue whether the district court erred in dismissing the two complaints on the\nsole ground that plaintiffs all lacked standing. The heart of the standing doctrine as it has developed over the past\ntwo decades is the requirement that a plaintiff have a \"personal stake\" in the outcome of the lawsuit, evidenced\nby the existence of \"injury in fact.\" See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 72,\n98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978); Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, 397 U.S.\n150, 152-53, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663\n(1962). \"As refined by subsequent reformulation, this requirement of a `personal stake' has come to be\nunderstood to require not only a `distinct and palpable injury,' to the plaintiff, . . but also a `fairly traceable' causal\nconnection between the claimed injury and the challenged conduct.\" Duke Power, 438 U.S. at 72, 98 S.Ct. at\n2630. And the latter requirement is said to imply a third: namely, \"a showing that there is a `substantial likelihood'\nthat the relief requested will redress the injury claimed.\" 438 U.S. at 75 n. 20, 98 S.Ct. at 2631 n. 20. See also \nCity of Hartford v. Towns of Glastonbury, 561 F.2d 1032, 1050 (2d Cir. 1976) (en banc).\nEach of these interrelated requirements has recently been discussed by the Supreme Court. In O'Shea v.\nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), the Court decided that nineteen plaintiffs who\nclaimed to be threatened with discriminatory bail and sentencing treatment had not made out the requisite degree\nof personal injury to invoke the Court's jurisdiction. \"Abstract injury is not enough,\" the Court said. \"It must be\nalleged that the plaintiff `has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury' as the result\nof the challenged statute or official conduct.\" Id. at 494, 94 S.Ct. at 675.\n519 *519 In Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), the absence of a causal connection\nbetween the challenged zoning law and the plaintiffs' harm especially troubled the majority. As the Court stated, \n422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. at 2208:\n\"Petitioners must allege facts from which it reasonably could be inferred that, absent the\nrespondents' restrictive zoning practices, there is a substantial probability that they would have\nbeen able to purchase or lease in Penfield and that, if the court affords the relief requested, the\nasserted inability of petitioners will be removed.\"\nThe Warth Court indicated it might be more receptive to challenges directed at specific restrictions on particular\nhousing project proposals. Id. at 516, 95 S.Ct. 2197. In Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977), the Court confirmed this indication,\nholding that the plaintiff 00 a developer seeking permission to construct low-income housing 00 had standing to\n97 97\nchallenge refusal of a zoning variance for the project. \"When a project is as detailed and specific as Lincoln\nGreen, a court is not required to engage in undue speculation as a predicate for finding that the plaintiff has the\nrequisite personal stake in the controversy.\" 429 U.S. at 261-62, 97 S.Ct. at 561.\nThe final factor of redressability is illustrated in the Court's decision in Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights\nOrganization (EKWRO), 426 U.S. 26, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). Declaring that a \"federal court [can]\nact only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and not injury that\nresults from the independent action of some third party not before the court,\" 426 U.S. at 41-42, 96 S.Ct. at 1926,\nthe majority found the complaint unavailing because it was \"purely speculative\" whether the harm of immediate\nconcern to plaintiffs could fairly be traced to the actions of the defendant. Id. at 42-43, 96 S.Ct. 1917. As a result,\nthere could be no assurance that any relief the Court granted would actually benefit the plaintiffs. Id. In Duke\n\nPower, by contrast, the Court upheld plaintiffs' standing where the district court had found a \"but for\" relationship\nbetween the challenged statute and the alleged harm. 438 U.S. at 75, 98 S.Ct. 2620.\nIn sum, the recent cases turn largely on the extent to which it appears that plaintiff is suffering tangible harm\ntraceable to the challenged actions of the defendant 00 harm which will be lessened if the requested remedy is\n97\ngranted.\nII.\n[6]\nThe district court treated the UDAG section of the complaint  as raising but a single issue, namely whether or\nnot Boston was eligible under § 5318(b) to receive UDAG funds. The court apparently saw its options either as\nfinding the city eligible, in which case plaintiffs would receive no relief, or finding the city ineligible, in which case\nBoston would be cut off from all UDAG funds. In the latter event, plaintiffs' injury 00 their inability to share in the\n97\nbenefits of funded projects 00 could not be redressed, since no one would benefit from projects that were never\n97\nbuilt.\nPlaintiffs maintain on appeal that the court erred in failing to recognize that their complaint actually involves two\ndistinct issues. Besides disputing Boston's eligibility for UDAG funds, plaintiffs say they also seek relief ensuring\nthat any projects that are funded are carried out in conformity with non-discrimination provisions of federal law,\nsuch as Titles VI and VIII, see note 4 supra, and the due process clause of the fifth amendment. Thus, they say,\nthey are asking the court to compel HUD to condition any UDAG grants on the city's meeting certain equal\n[7]\nopportunity and affirmative action standards.\n520 *520 In considering the threshold issue of standing, it is not, of course, the court's responsibility to pass finally on\nwhether plaintiffs will prevail on their statutory or constitutional claims. Assuming their claims have minimal\nsubstance, the question is merely whether these plaintiffs are appropriate parties to raise such claims.\n\"In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the\nmerits of the dispute or of particular issues. . . .\n. . . As an aspect of justiciability, the standing question is whether the plaintiff has `alleged such a\npersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy' as to warrant his invocation of federal-court\njurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court's remedial powers on his behalf.\"\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (emphasis in original).\nA.\nWe address first the question of plaintiffs' standing to challenge Boston's eligibility for UDAG funds. To the extent\nthis lawsuit merely contests eligibility, we agree with the district court that the relevant relief 00 cutting off of funds\n97\n00 would not relieve plaintiffs of the injuries of which they complain, and that they therefore lack standing to seek\n97\nsuch relief.\nThe UDAG program is currently authorized for three years of funding. HUD approves applications from individual\neligible cities for specific projects. If Boston is declared ineligible for grants until such time as the city satisfies the\n\"demonstrated results\" test, all the grant funds may well be expended elsewhere before the city is able to apply\nfor them. Denying everyone in Boston the benefits of this emergency funding program for distressed cities does\nnot seem well calculated to redress the housing needs of those who have been victims of discrimination.\nPlaintiffs, indeed, concede that \"flat denial of UDAG funds to the City of Boston is neither the sole available relief\nnor the most desirable\"; but they nonetheless argue that even the denial of eligibility would be a kind of redress of\ntheir grievance. They say they seek not just jobs or housing per se, but equal access to the housing and\nemployment benefits of UDAG. Equality would be achieved 00 if only the equality of equal misery 00 if funds were\n97 97\ndenied to everyone in Boston. The difficulty with this approach is that a mere abstract denial of equal opportunity\n\ndoes not constitute injury in fact. A general denial of equal opportunity does not confer standing on a particular\nindividual unless that individual would have had access to the benefit at stake in the absence of discrimination.\n521 Illustrative of this principle is our decision in Jackson v. Dukakis, 526 F.2d 64 (1st *521 Cir. 1975). A black\nresident of Boston challenged the hiring practices of sixteen state agencies under the Equal Protection Clause\nand 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983. Although plaintiff may have had a cause of action, to the extent he alleged a\ndiscriminatory pattern of failing to hire minorities, we nevertheless held he had not alleged the requisite causal\nconnection between the state's violations and his own status as an unemployed person. Because he had never\napplied to the state for a job, it could not be said he had suffered any harm as a result of the state's policy.\n\"Although the categories of judicially cognizable injury have been broadened to include\nnoneconomic injuries, [citations omitted], the Supreme Court has recently `stressed that the\nbroadening of categories \"is a different matter from abandoning the requirement that the party\nseeking review must himself have suffered an injury.\"'\"\n526 F.2d at 65 (emphasis in original).\nTo be sure, every court has not analyzed the question in this same way. See, e. g., Coalition for Block Grant\nCompliance v. HUD, 450 F.Supp. 43 (E.D.Mich.1978); Knoxville Progressive Christian Coalition v. Testerman,\n404 F.Supp. 783, 788 (E.D.Tenn. 1975) (dictum). But see City of Hartford v. Towns of Glastonbury, 561 F.2d 1032\n(2d Cir. 1977) (en banc). In Coalition for Block Grant Compliance, supra, community organizations and minority\nresidents of Detroit sued HUD seeking to halt the flow of CDBG funds to the suburban city of Livonia, because\nLivonia's CDBG application did not contain adequate \"expected to reside\" figures, as required by law. The\nMichigan district court rejected defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing, holding that since plaintiffs\nalleged they expected to reside in Livonia, the failure to plan for their housing needs produced an injury to them.\nThe court distinguished Warth v. Seldin on the ground that \"plaintiffs are not complaining, as the Warth plaintiffs\ndid, that their injury lies in the fact that they cannot live in Livonia. Instead, these plaintiffs complain that Livonia\ndid not plan for their needs as Congress directed.\" 450 F.Supp.at 51 (emphasis in original). Later in the opinion\nthe court stated approvingly: \"Plaintiffs allege that the violation of the statute by HUD produced their injury in\nfact.\" Id.\nBy contrast, the en banc Second Circuit, in City of Hartford, supra, held that nonresident plaintiffs had no\nstanding to challenge a town's omission of \"expected to reside\" figures. Increasing those figures would not lead\nto more housing being built, the court found, because the defendant towns had already received all the funds to\nwhich they were entitled. \"Consequently, the prospect that the submission of accurate expected to reside figures\nsought by the plaintiffs will have a positive effect on the plaintiffs' expectancy interest is at best speculative.\" Id. at\n1051. It seems evident that the Second Circuit did not believe mere violation of the statutory requirement raised a\nright of standing for plaintiffs; the violation must lead to a material harm to the plaintiffs which the court is\nempowered to relieve. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 96 S.Ct. 1917,\n48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).\nWe recognize that in circumstances different from those present here, the threat of denial of funds is a form of\nrelief that could meaningfully redress the discriminatory abuse of those funds. In Committee for Full Employment\nv. Blumenthal, 196 U.S.App.D.C. ___, 606 F.2d 1062 (1979), several minority individuals, and organizations\nrepresenting them, sued the Office of Revenue Sharing for continuing to provide funds to cities that allegedly\nviolated civil rights provisions of the Revenue Sharing Act. The court of appeals reversed the dismissal of the\ncomplaint for lack of standing, on the ground, inter alia, that plaintiffs' allegations sufficiently established a\nlikelihood the relief they requested would provide a benefit. The court noted that plaintiffs' alleged the recipient\ncities were \"dependent on revenue sharing funds to carry out vital municipal activities.\" Id. at ___, 606 F.2d at\n522 1066. These governments *522 were also independently obligated to observe plaintiffs' civil rights, the court\npointed out. They did not have the option to refuse funds and continue to discriminate. Id.\nHere, on the other hand, the UDAG grants will not be used to finance essential city services. Boston is not\ncompelled to take these funds regardless of the strings attached. Further, while the city is itself obligated by law\nnot to engage in discrimination, it is not obligated to build these particular projects; the option exists to drop them\naltogether, cutting off the benefits to everyone. Most significantly, plaintiffs in this part of their action are seeking\n\nto have Boston declared ineligible for funds pursuant to an express statutory provision linking eligibility with past\nconduct. In order to reestablish its eligibility, the city would have to \"demonstrate results\" in providing equal\nopportunity in its remaining programs. 42 U.S.C. § 5318(b). We agree with the district court that it is problematic\nwhether such a demonstration could be achieved within the period when UDAG funds will still be available to the\ncity.\nB.\nLack of redressability is therefore a bar to standing, insofar as plaintiffs would attack Boston's eligibility for UDAG\nfunds. But as plaintiffs point out, their complaint is not limited to a challenge to eligibility. The complaint also\nspeaks in terms of HUD's failure to implement \"meaningful and effective measures to enforce and monitor\ncompliance with non-discrimination provisions required by law.\" The relief sought is cast in terms of curtailing\nfederal financial assistance to Boston only until such time as the defendants submit and the court approves a\ncomprehensive plan, to be monitored by the court, which will \"abate and prevent the racially discriminatory acts\n....\" The Supreme Court has observed that \"[f]or purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing,\nboth the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and must\nconstrue the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. at 2206. We\nconstrue the complaint as in effect requesting, in the alternative, that the court take action to ensure that any\nproject which HUD decides to fund is conducted in compliance with anti-discrimination laws and the federal\nconstitution.\nThe district court upheld plaintiffs' standing to challenge CDBG grants, in part because it found that HUD, in a\nproper case, might be required to condition these funds on the city's meeting specific requirements of the civil\n[8]\nrights section of the HCDA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5304 et seq. See also 24 C.F.R. § 570.910. The court apparently\n[9]\ndetermined, however, that UDAG funds could not be so conditioned under the same statutory provisions.  The\ncourt seems to have decided that § 5318(b)'s eligibility requirements were the only judicially enforceable\nlimitations on HUD's authority to commit funds under UDAG. While this view of the law may eventually be proven\ncorrect, we think it premature to make such a far-reaching ruling now, as part of a threshold determination of\n[10]\nstanding. Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, prohibits discrimination in federally assisted programs and activities.  If\n523 plaintiffs can succeed in showing a particular *523 project would be discriminatory, the fact that Boston's basic\neligibility for funds is beyond their capacity to challenge would not necessarily prevent appropriate judicial relief to\n[11]\nensure that HUD carries out its civil rights responsibilities with respect to that particular project.\nThis is not meant by any means to signal our view that plaintiffs will prevail, or indeed that they have stated a\nsufficient claim to withstand a motion for summary judgment or a motion to dismiss on another ground. The kind\nof receivership sought in the prayer for relief, see note 7 supra, is unprecedented. It would take a strong 00 one\n97\nmight say a unique 00 showing to support judicial intervention in a project before it is constructed. Moreover,\n97\nneither the city nor any private developer are parties to this suit. It may be that, for a variety of reasons, judicial\nrelief will turn out to be inappropriate, at least in the form presently sought, and perhaps in any form discernible in\nthis litigation. Still, the foregoing are not considerations that should control the standing issue now under review.\nThey relate more properly to questions of justiciability, and judicial and equitable power, which can better be\nresolved in another context. For the purpose of reviewing plaintiffs' standing, we think we must assume that the\ncomplaint is seeking relief aimed at ensuring that any UDAG project will comply with federal statutory and\nconstitutional anti-discrimination standards. We further think 00 without at this time purporting to pass on the\n97\njusticiability and merits of such claims 00 that they are not so patently far-fetched that we should dismiss them out\n97\nof hand on the basis of the sparse record now before us, and without further district court determination.\nAccordingly, we accept such claims provisionally for the very limited purpose of determining whether these\nparticular plaintiffs have standing to raise them.\nWhen the claims are so viewed, the redressability ground dispositive of the question of eligibility ceases to be\nmaterial. The relief being sought would 00 or so we must assume for present purposes 00 make UDAG funded\n97 97\nprojects more open and accessible to minority residents of Boston, and protect them against discrimination\n\nshould they reside in such projects. Tangible relief would be afforded to someone. The standing question thus\ncomes down simply to whether the present plaintiffs have a sufficient personal stake to seek such relief.\nIII.\nThe plaintiffs in these two cases fall into three basic groups. In the first group are the \"Black Caucus\" plaintiffs,\nDoris Bunte, Robert Fortes, and Melvin King. These individuals are described in the complaint as black residents\nof minority neighborhoods in Boston who are also elected representatives of the state legislature. They allege\nthey are \"dedicated to working to eradicate racial discrimination in housing and employment on behalf of their\nconstituents.\" While this is doubtless so, these plaintiffs do not have the requisite personal stake. None alleges\nhe would leave his present neighborhood to move into a UDAG-funded project, even if this opportunity were\navailable to him. Nor are any members of this group alleged to be seeking employment on these projects. Like\nthe environmental organization that claimed standing because of its special interest in environmental issues,\nthese plaintiffs are not suffering a direct harm; they do not satisfy the strictures of Article III. See Sierra Club v.\nMorton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972).\nThe second group consists of three black persons whose alleged injury is that racial tension in the city of Boston\n524 interferes with *524 the conduct of their daily lives. Plaintiff Sandra Gibbs is the assistant secretary of the\nMassachusetts Department of Transportation, and in her official capacity she is expected to travel throughout the\ncity. She alleges that her ability to do so is hampered by racial tension which \"is perpetuated and exacerbated by\nracial discrimination in housing and employment opportunities in Boston.\" Mary Grigsby, a resident of\npredominantly white West Roxbury, claims that she has been harassed and her home has been vandalized\nbecause of racial tension resulting from segregated housing patterns. Plaintiff Laverne S. Roberts allegedly was\nattacked by white youths while driving through South Boston; as a result of this incident and others reported in\nthe news media, she is afraid to travel through or live in certain areas of the city.\nThese plaintiffs have undoubtedly suffered a serious harm, one that readily satisfies the first prong of the injury-\nin-fact requirement. Still, we are unpersuaded that any HUD-directed relief emerging from this lawsuit could\nalleviate, even in a small way, the injury of which these persons complain. Plaintiffs apparently assert that if HUD\nmade a greater effort to ensure affirmative action in federally funded Boston housing projects, then the racially\nsegregated character of the city would change and in turn greater integration would lessen the level of racial\ntension and permit plaintiffs to live more secure lives. This chain of reasoning, in our opinion, is too attenuated.\nAdmittedly, the Supreme Court has not always required that the reasoning that supports standing proceed with\ninexorable logic, see United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973), but the\ncausal connection must consist of something more than speculation.\nHere, there is no indication that \"but for\" the government's actions plaintiffs' injuries would not exist. See Duke\nPower Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978). Nor is\nthis situation comparable to Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 60 L.Ed.2d 66\n(1979). There, the Court upheld plaintiffs' standing under Title VIII to challenge alleged \"racial steering\" by\nrealtors that contributed to segregation of plaintiffs' neighborhood. Even though the plaintiffs had not themselves\nbeen \"steered,\" that is, influenced to purchase a home in another area on account of race, the Court found they\nhad suffered the kind of injury Title VIII was enacted to prevent, namely loss of the benefits of living in an\nintegrated area. Despite surface similarities, the difference between this case and Bellwood, at least with regard\nto these plaintiffs, is apparent. A judicial order to realtors to stop \"steering\" customers by race is likely to have a\nmeasurable impact on the racial composition of a localized area. An order to HUD to increase its efforts to\npromote equal opportunity in Boston's UDAG program is much less certain to affect minority residents of distant\nneighborhoods. We do not perceive a \"substantial likelihood\" that the relief requested will redress the injury this\ngroup of plaintiffs claims. Duke Power, 438 U.S. at 75 n.20, 98 S.Ct. 2620.\n[12]\nThe third group of plaintiffs includes the remaining four individuals suing with NAACP,  and the individual\nplaintiffs in the LUCHA action. Each of the NAACP plaintiffs is a black person whose principal claim is that she\nlives in substandard housing in a segregated area of Boston. Each claims to have sought \"decent low-cost\nhousing in an integrated neighborhood\" actively over a period of years without success. Plaintiffs' injury is thus\n\nthe inability to secure such housing. This injury is plainly the sort of palpable harm that satisfies the first prong of\nthe standing test. As to causation and redressability, plaintiffs maintain that if HUD were required to live up to its\n525 putative responsibilities under the various statutes and constitutional provisions *525 they cite, more housing of\nthe sort they seek would be made available to them and they would stand a substantial chance of improving their\nhousing situation.\nAs we have stated, in ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing, \"both the trial and reviewing courts must\naccept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the\ncomplaining party.\" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. at 2206. Applying this standard, we cannot find that\nthese pleadings are so deficient or so implausible that dismissal is warranted. The situation of these plaintiffs is\ncomparable to that of the individual plaintiff, Ransom, found to have standing in Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHousing Development Corp., supra, 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). There, the Court\nemphasized that Ransom was interested in seeking low-cost housing in Arlington Heights and that he would be\nqualified for the particular project MHDC was seeking to construct. In contrast to the generalized and attenuated\nnexus between the harm and the wrong in Warth v. Seldin, the Court in Arlington Heights found an \"actionable\ncausal relationship\" between the violation and the asserted injury. 429 U.S. at 264, 97 S.Ct. 555.\nAlthough none of the plaintiffs here has specifically alleged an intention to seek housing in a UDAG-financed\ndevelopment, it can reasonably be inferred from their complaint that they would accept such housing if it were\nphysically safe and financially accessible to them. The conditions plaintiffs seek to have HUD enforce would\napparently be aimed at ensuring just that result. Moreover, the complaint charges HUD with failing over a period\nof years to secure from the city of Boston proper compliance with the civil rights laws. Plaintiffs' inability to find\ndecent and integrated housing during those years, clearly alleged in their complaint, is \"fairly traceable\" to HUD's\n[13]\nasserted misconduct. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 261, 97 S.Ct. 555.\nWe reach a similar conclusion with respect to the plaintiffs in the LUCHA suit. According to the complaint, Ruth\nCruzado is a recipient of public assistance who was rejected for a federal subsidy on her rent due to unavailability\nof funds. \"Over the past several years, [she] has actively sought decent and safe low-cost housing in Chelsea but\nhas been unable to obtain such housing,\" the complaint states. Maria Crespo is a part-time VISTA worker who\nhas also been refused a Section 8 rent subsidy and who has actively sought alternative housing. Allegedly, she\nhas been waiting six years for a response to her application for a city job. Santos Flores is an unemployed adult\nmale who has actively sought alternative housing and a job with the city. Jimmy Mercado is an unemployed adult\nmale who has sought employment with the City of Chelsea.\n526 Each of the first three asserts that he or she is actively seeking to move to *526 decent, low-cost housing in a\nsafer and more integrated neighborhood. Plaintiffs claim that the law imposes on HUD an obligation to make\nsuch housing available through its development grants program. HUD's alleged failure to do so has a tangible\nimpact on their chances of attaining their goal. Similarly, three of the plaintiffs have unsuccessfully sought\nemployment with the city. They allege HUD's failure to abide by its asserted statutory mandate to enforce\naffirmative action in employment has decreased their chances to gain employment under Chelsea's CDBG or\nUDAG programs. Plaintiffs have alleged a tangible harm. They have differentiated themselves from the general\nbulk of other citizens who are not presently seeking low-cost housing or employment with the city government.\nWe discern a substantial likelihood that the relief they request 00 if found to be justified 00 will redress the injuries\n97 97\nof which they complain. See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 75 n.20, 98\nS.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252,\n262, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26,\n[14]\n38, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976).\nIV.\nWe emphasize in conclusion what we have not decided on this appeal. First of all, we have not eliminated the\nissue of standing from this lawsuit. The plaintiffs we have indicated have standing must continue to carry the\nburden of proof on standing. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, supra, 426 U.S. at 45,\n95 S.Ct. 2197; City of Hartford v. Towns of Glastonbury, 561 F.2d 1032, 1051 (2d Cir. 1976) (en banc). A\n\ncomplaint may suffice to overcome a motion to dismiss and yet fail at summary judgment, when the district court\ncan reasonably expect a more specific factual demonstration of the plaintiffs' entitlement to standing. Simon v.\nEastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, supra, 426 U.S. at 45 n.25, 96 S.Ct. 1917. At trial, plaintiffs must\n[15]\nprove the facts essential to support their claim to standing. City of Hartford, supra, 561 F.2d at 1051.  In other\nwords, at this stage of the litigation we say only that plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to permit them to\novercome the hurdle of a motion to dismiss for want of standing. Like the plaintiffs in Committee for Full\nEmployment v. Blumenthal, 196 U.S.App.D.C. ___, 606 F.2d 1062 (1979), plaintiffs Roberts, Cobb, Link, Paul,\nCruzado, Crespo, Flores and Mercado, and their organizations, are \"entitled to conduct discovery to buttress their\nallegation that there is a substantial likelihood that the relief they request will eliminate their injury.\" At ___, 606\nF.2d at 1067.\nWe also do not decide the issue of ripeness on this appeal, see note 13 supra, nor any of the other issues going\nto the justiciability of this matter. See, e. g., Ad Hoc Committee on Judicial Administration v. Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, 488 F.2d 1241 (1st Cir. 1973),cert. denied,416 U.S. 986, 94 S.Ct. 2389, 40 L.Ed.2d 763 (1974).\nWe of course express no opinion on the merits, and no inference should be drawn from anything in this opinion\n527 as to the *527 existence of any of the legal duties plaintiffs have ascribed to the defendants.\nOur holding can be briefly summarized as follows. The judgments of dismissal for lack of standing are vacated\nwith respect to plaintiffs Roberts, Cobb, Link, Paul, and NAACP in No. 79-1051, and Cruzado, Crespo, Flores,\nMercado, and LUCHA in No. 79-1114. These plaintiffs have standing to go forward with their actions to the extent\nthey challenge the failure by HUD to impose conditions on UDAG funding in Boston and Chelsea designed to\nfoster the affirmative action and anti-discrimination requirements of federal law. In all other respects, the\njudgments of dismissal for lack of standing are affirmed, as we deem none of the plaintiffs to have standing to\nchallenge HUD's determinations concerning the cities' basic eligibility for UDAG funds.\nAffirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n[*] Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n[1] The court refused to dismiss on standing grounds the portion of each complaint challenging the CDBG grants.\nNo question relative to that program is now before us.\n[2] Under 24 C.F.R. § 570.455(d), state agencies are designated in each of several areas to conduct what are\ncalled A-95 reviews, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-95. The record indicates MCAD has been designated to\nreview UDAG applications for compliance with applicable civil rights laws.\n[3] Plaintiffs assert in their brief that a third project has since been approved.\n[4] The provisions on which plaintiffs based their claims are: \n1) Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act, 42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq. and 24 C.F.R. § 570.601;\n2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. and the regulations at 24 C.F.R. §§ 1.1-1.12;\n3) Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; and\n4) the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n[5] The same order also denied the request for a TRO enjoining disbursement of CDBG funds, on the ground\nplaintiffs had not shown a substantial likelihood they would prevail on the merits.\n[6] Because LUCHA in its brief adopts the arguments presented by NAACP, we focus on the Boston case. Our\ndiscussion of that case, however, is equally applicable to the similar issues in the Chelsea case.\n[7] Plaintiff NAACP's complaint stated: \n\"Plaintiffs allege that defendants have unlawfully approved, and/or provided and continue to provide the City of\nBoston with millions of dollars in [CDBG and UDAG] funds . . . despite their knowledge that minority persons are\n\nbeing excluded from equal access to the benefits of the programs funded by these funds. Defendants have\nfurther failed to implement meaningful and effective measures to enforce and monitor compliance with\nnondiscrimination provisions required by law.\"\nSimilarly, the complaint in LUCHA v. Harris, stated:\n\"Plaintiff LUCHA's members have been, are being, and will be aggrieved by the failure of the defendants to\nenforce equal opportunity requirements in housing and employment with regard to Chelsea's use and proposed\nuse of CDBG and UDAG funds. Such members . . . are being denied equal access to the benefits of the CDBG\nand UDAG programs and activities in that they are effectively excluded from participation in such programs and\nactivities by the failure of the defendants to enforce the civil rights laws.\"\nEach complaint closed with a broad prayer for relief asking the district court to enjoin HUD from \"approving,\ngranting, disbursing, transferring, expending, committing, or otherwise disposing of\" funds to the cities,\n\"until such time as the defendants submit and the Court approves a comprehensive plan, to be monitored by the\nCourt, which will abate and prevent the racially discriminatory acts, practices, and/or policies complained of and\nassure effective control and monitoring of all Federal financial assistance provided by the defendants to the City\nof Boston [Chelsea].\"\n[8] The court also noted that CDBG funds could readily be allocated from discriminatory uses to non-\ndiscriminatory ones within the same metropolitan area. See 24 C.F.R. § 570.-409(d)(1)(i).\n[9] In its order on the motion to dismiss of January 2, 1979, the court said, \"While, as plaintiff says, the\ndefendants could, and possibly should have, conditioned the grant on the enforcement of non-discriminatory\nemployment practices in the several projects, this is not a statutory condition of the grant.\"\n[10] The substantive provision of Title VI reads as follows: \n\"No person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\"\nSee Blackshear Residents Organization v. Housing Authority of City of Austin, 347 F.Supp. 1138 (D.Tex.1972).\n[11] Defendants argue that the UDAG statute does not specifically authorize the kind of judicial relief with respect\nto ongoing projects that plaintiffs, in part, seek. Plaintiffs reply that other laws and constitutional provisions should\nbe interpreted as imposing on HUD the duty to condition these grants. This is not a question we think should be\ndecided at this stage in connection with the standing issue. The district court can better deal with it on remand, in\ndeciding whether or not it is empowered to grant any of the requested relief, after plaintiffs have indicated more\nconcretely what relief they seek.\n[12] One plaintiff, Laverne Roberts, falls into both the second and third groups, since she alleges injuries of each\nkind. The other three members of this third group are Mary Lee Cobb, Patricia Link, and Dorothy Paul.\n[13] Defendants contend, nonetheless, that plaintiffs' claim to standing should be barred because their injuries\nare not ripe. While it is true, as defendants say, that plaintiffs' asserted injuries have not yet occurred, we do not\n00 on the basis of this complaint 00 view the possibility of their occurring as mere speculation. Plaintiff does not\n97 97\nhave to allege a completed injury, only that there is an imminent threat of injury. And in determining the issue of\nimminence, \"past wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated\ninjury.\" O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 496, 94 S.Ct. 669, 676, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). Here, the plaintiffs have\nalleged a long litany of past abuses by Boston housing authorities operating under the supervision and approval\nof HUD. Various studies and reports submitted to HUD during the course of the decision process on Boston's\ngrant applications indicated serious problems with equal employment and housing conditions. HUD allegedly\napproved Boston's current applications despite its knowledge of serious past abuses. It does not seem\nunreasonable to infer that HUD's approval of these proposals, without conditions, may represent a recurrence of\nthe alleged past pattern of ignoring plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional rights. \n\nWe do not mean to indicate that there is no ripeness issue in this case. We leave that determination for the\ndistrict court. We find only that the complaints of injury are not so speculative, by reason of prematurity, as to\ndeprive plaintiffs of standing.\n[14] As a result of our decision to grant standing, for present purposes, to the individual named plaintiffs who\nhave alleged inability to obtain housing or employment benefits as their injury, we also grant standing to NAACP\nand LUCHA as representatives of their members. As the Supreme Court said in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. at 511,\n95 S.Ct. at 2211-2212: \n\"Even in the absence of injury to itself, an association may have standing solely as the representative of its\nmembers. . . . The association must allege that its members, or any one of them, are suffering immediate or\nthreatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the\nmembers themselves brought suit.\"\n[15] To avoid an unnecessary trial, the district court may conduct a preliminary evidentiary hearing on standing or\nother issues of justiciability.

As grounds for this motion, J\\'AACP states as follows: \n1.  The Consent Decree required  HUD, among other things, to \"provide subsidies for \n500 units having, as an average J bedrooms, of Section 8 family housing ... in addition to what any \npublic housing agency operating in Boston may receive under a fair share allocation.\" Furthennore, \nthe Consent Decree provided that in the event HUD's Section 8 appropriations proved to be \ninsufficient to meet this obligation,  HUD was \"to make available funding to the recipient ptlblic \nA copy of the Consent Decree is submitted herewith under Tab l. \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 73   Filed 05/23/05   Page 2 of 5\nhousing agency(s) lor a comparable substitute housing resource  ...  if, and to the extent that, any \nappropriation is legally available for these purposes.\"  Consent Decree, § H.C.2 (emphasis supplied). \n2.  HUD allocated  subsidies for 400 of the 500  units to be administered by the BHA. \n3.  On February 8, 2000, the Court granted NAACP's and HUD'sjoint \nmotion2 to modify the Consent Decree to, among other things: \na.  allow the subsidies for all 500 units to be used as Section 8 vouchers, 3 and \nb.  require that the Section 8 vouchers be made available only to minority \nfamilies to be used only for housing located in predominantly white \nneighborhoods (at least during the first 120 days of a vouchers' term.). \n4.  As  HlTD  acknowledged in an agreement leading up to the above-\nmentioned joint motion (\"the Modification Agreement\"),' \nthe  purpose of the  500  units of housing created by these Section 8 \nsubsidies is to increase the number of affordable desegregated housing \nopport1mities available to minority families in order to remedy HUD' s \nfailure, as found by [this Court] ... affirmatively to further fair housing in \nthe City in that the Court found that [among other things], despite HUD's \nknowledge  that  a  housing  emergency  existed  which  had  a \ndisproportionate impact on low income black families, HUD did not ... \nfinance  the increase of desegregated  housing stock to  give  minority \nfamilies meaningful choice oflocation. \n5.  On January 26, 2005, NAACP was informed, by a carbon copy of a letter \nfrom the BHA to HUD5 that  as a result of recent revisions in HUD's funding ofBHA's Section \n8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, HlJD would be providing funding in 2005 for only 217 of \nA copy of the motion is submitted herewith under Tab 2 and of the Court's ruling under Tab 3. \nThe Consent Decree provision that 300 of the 500 unit subsidies be project-based proved to be not feasible. \nA copy of the Modification Agreement is submitted herewith under Tab 4. \nA copy ofthL' letter is submitted herewith under Tab 5. \n2 \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 73   Filed 05/23/05   Page 3 of 5\nthe 400  Section 8 vouchers HUD had allocated to the BHA under the Consent Decree, even \nthough 259 vouchers were under lease, and 141 vouchers had been issued to families in search \nfor apartments, and  tbat even the funding for the 217 vouchers was further reduced under HCD's \nprogrammatic funding reduction formula.  In addition, NAACP has been informed that HUD's \nper-unit funding allowance is insufficient for the present-day fair market rent for a three \nbedroom apartment in tbe Boston area. \n6.  Sueh reductions and shortfalls in HUD's funding are in violation ofHUD's \nobligations under the Consent Decree and the Modification Agreement. \n7.  In accordance with Section IV.A. of the Consent Decree, NAACP has \nconsulted with HUD, along with the BHA and the City of Boston, at a meeting of all the parties \nand through telephone conferences and correspondence,  in an effort to resolve the matter \ninformally, but HUD has declined to reconsider its funding decisions, has refused to authorize \nthe BHA to use an available financial resource as at least a stopgap measure,  and has failed to \noffer any solution to the problem·6 \nWHEREFORE, the Court should order HUD to take steps forthwith to assure full \nfunding, over and above the subsidies that any public housing agency operating in Boston may \nreceive under a fair share allocation, and utilizing either Section 8 or other legally available \nappropriations, reserves or resources, for the 400 vouchers administered by the BHA under the \nConsent Decree and the Modification Agreement, at a level sufficient to provide a mix of units \nhaving as an average 3 bedrooms. \n,, \nCopies of documents reflecting these consultations are subrmtted herewith under Tabs 6 through 12. \n3 \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 73   Filed 05/23/05   Page 4 of 5\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \n/  garman, Rogers, Barshak & Cohen, P.C. \n/  101 Merrimac Street \nI \nBoston, MA  02114 \n' \n(617) 227-3030 \nDATED:  May 20, 2005 \nPLAINTIFF'S RULE 7.1 CERTIFICATE \nI, Natasha C.

The grants were of two types, Urban Development Action Grants (\"UDAG\") and\nCommunity Development Block Grants (\"CDBG\"). The claims of some of the individual plaintiffs with respect to\nUDAG grants were dismissed for lack of standing pursuant to remand from the Court of Appeals (reversing in part\nthe order of this court dismissing all the UDAG claims). NAACP v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514 (1st Cir.1979). The motion\n639 to dismiss with respect to CDBG grants was denied by this court so that at the time of trial all the *639 plaintiffs\nremained in the case with respect to CDBG claims.\nStanding of Individual Plaintiffs.\nAt trial no evidence was offered on behalf of any plaintiff except the National Association for the Advancement of\nColored People, Boston Chapter (\"NAACP\"). No injury in fact having been established as to the individual\nplaintiffs, this action is dismissed with respect to all plaintiffs except the NAACP.\nStanding of NAACP.\nThere was no evidence of specific injury in fact to any identified member of the NAACP. Evidence supporting the\n[1]\nstanding of the NAACP appears only in the testimony of the president of the local chapter, Joseph D. Feaster.\nThis testimony supports the following conclusions:\n(1) The local chapter of the NAACP actively represents the interest of black people in metropolitan Boston, and it\ndoes not restrict its activities to its members. See NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405\n(1963). The members, however, are a principal source of its funds through their dues, and are both black and\nwhite.\n(2) The discriminatory administration by the City of UDAG and CDBG funds caused injury in fact to NAACP's\nmember and nonmember constituency.\n(3) The City's racial discrimination in housing and job opportunities was contrary to the goals of the NAACP and\ntherefore interfered with the efforts of the NAACP to achieve racial justice, thus causing injury in fact to NAACP.\n\nNAACP argues that it has both representative standing and standing in its own right to redress its own injury in\nfact. In Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982), the\nSupreme Court considered the independent standing of an organization called Housing Opportunities Made\nEqual (\"HOME\"). The function of HOME was \"to assist equal access to housing through counseling and other\nreferral services\". It alleged that its efforts had been frustrated by the defendant's activities. The Court ruled that\nHOME had standing in its own right:\nSuch concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization's activities 00 with the consequent drain\n97\non the organization's resources00 constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization's\n97\nabstract social interests, see Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. [727] at 739 [92 S.Ct. 1361 at 1368,\n31 L.Ed.2d 636] [1972]. Id.\nThe present case appears to me to fall within the rule of Haven Realty, and to be equally distinguishable from \nSierra Club v. Morton, See generally, Chayes, The Supreme Court 1981 Term 00 Forward: Public Law Litigation\n97\nand the Burger Court, 96 Harv.L.R. 4, 8-26 (1982).\nIn the absence of any contrary evidence, I have no reason to disbelieve Mr. Feaster's conclusion that the\norganization has suffered injury in fact. Accordingly, I find and rule that the NAACP has standing in its own right to\npursue redress in this action.\nA second basis for standing is the NAACP's status as a representative of black people in Boston, some of whom\nare its members.\n[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would\notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane\nto the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires\nthe participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\nHunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383\n(1977).\n640 The NAACP clearly qualifies under (b), see NAACP v. Button, supra, and where *640 only declaratory and\ninjunctive relief are sought, it qualifies under (c). Mr. Feaster testified that the discriminatory action by the City has\nadversely affected the members of the NAACP, who would have had standing to sue in their own right. He cites\nno names, places, dates or other supporting testimony. Mr. Feaster did not distinguish between injury in fact to\nmembers with respect to UDAG grants and injury in fact to members with respect to CDBG grants.\nFailure to condition CDBG grants to improve the lot of black people generally is likely to affect all black people in\nthe City, including the black members of the NAACP. Plaintiff's complaint about UDAG funds, however, has\ncentered primarily on the failure to provide low-income housing for minorities. I can make no assumption as to\nwhether members of NAACP are included among the specific segment of the population which qualifies for low-\nincome housing. It is clear, however, that this segment of the population includes a large proportion of black\npeople living within the area served by the plaintiff.\nIn view of the actual holding in Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission, supra, I am persuaded that\ninjury in fact to an actual formal membership is not an essential element of representational standing. The\nWashington Apple Advertising Commission is actually a state agency and the apple growers who suffered the\nalleged injury in fact were accurately described as its \"constituency\", since it obviously was not a membership\norganization. The NAACP's membership is in fact different from its constituency. Its membership consists of both\nwhite and black people, and is the principal source of its funds. Its constituency, however, according to Feaster,\nconsists of all the black people in metropolitan Boston. It does not purport to directly represent the interests of its\nwhite members. Hunt would appear to permit standing to be based on injury in fact to a defined and discrete\nconstituency. I recognize that Hunt can be distinguished on the ground that the apple growers possessed the\n\"indicia of membership in an organization\". They elected the members of the Commission from among\nthemselves and financed its activities through assessments. The nonmember constituency of the NAACP does\nnot possess these indicia. Nevertheless, the Court has relaxed the requirement of formal membership, and I\n\nconclude that it is both reasonable and sound policy to recognize the historic role of the NAACP as an\nappropriate representative of black people within the jurisdiction of the local chapter. See NAACP v. Button, supra\n; Chayes, op. cit.\nFINDINGS OF FACT ON THE MERITS\nRacial segregation and racial discrimination in public and private housing prevailed in all sections of Boston\nthroughout the period 1977 to the present. The black population of the City increased from 22% to 30% between\n1970 and 1980 and that the black population consisted of a larger proportion of families with children than\noccurred among the white population. The housing stock available to low-income families with children has\ndecreased during the same period, and the vacancy rate in low-income housing at the time of trial was only 3.7%.\nPart of the decrease has been caused by the condemnation of approximately 4,000 units of public housing\nadministered by the Boston Housing Authority as a result of bad maintenance, bad management and vandalism\nby tenants. Other loss of low-income housing has occurred through the rehabilitation and \"gentrification\" of\npreviously marginal housing, which in its rehabilitated form is affordable only by middle- and upper-income\npeople, most of whom are white.\nThere is a housing emergency in Boston.\nWhite and black households in need of housing assistance substantially differ in several respects: whereas\namong whites 74% are renters and 26% are owners, among blacks 92% are renters and 8% are owners;\nadditionally, while 44% of white renter households are elderly and 56% are families (i.e., households with\n641 children), only 26% of black renter household are elderly and 74% *641 are family. The median income of white\nfamilies is substantially higher than the median of black families. Thus, black households are more likely than\nwhite to be renters, family, and low income. The neighborhoods of Boston have traditionally been racially and\nethnically discrete. The black population is centered in Roxbury, South Roxbury, Dorchester and parts of\nMattapan. South Boston, East Boston, Charlestown, the North End of Boston, Bay Village, Beacon Hill and most\nof the Back Bay are predominantly white neighborhoods, though segregated by ethnic background. Racial\nviolence is common and both blacks and whites are afraid to live, work or travel in certain areas of the city\n[2]\nthought to be \"the turf\" of the other race.  These fears are justified. There are some areas of the city in which\nthe racial population is mixed, namely, Mission Hill, Brighton-Allston and certain sections of Roslindale, Hyde\nPark and parts of Dorchester, Mattapan and the South End.\nThe population of public housing projects follows the racial characteristics of the neighborhoods in which the\nprojects are located. Most of the projects designed for low-income families are in black neighborhoods. Most of\nthe projects in white neighborhoods are designed for the elderly.\nBlacks in predominantly black neighborhoods have not evidenced to HUD officials any interest in moving into the\nlower income white neighborhoods of the City. They have expressed a preference for moving to the suburbs and\nHUD has attempted to provide housing in surrounding communities. I find, however, that this preference is at\nleast in part the result of the lack of safe, desegregated housing in white neighborhoods.\nEnforcement of laws prohibiting racial discrimination in housing has been on the basis of complaints only, and the\nCity has not established any mechanism for overall monitoring of fair housing practices.\nRacial discrimination in hiring had been judicially found to exist in the City's police and fire departments,\ndeliberate racial segregation had been judicially found to exist in the City's schools, and historical segregation\nhad been judicially found to exist in the facilities administered by the Boston Housing Authority.\nAll of the above facts were well known to the officials of HUD responsible for Boston CDBG and UDAG programs\nfrom 1977 to the present time. HUD's administrative record for fiscal years 1977 through 1981 indicate that these\nfacts were discussed by HUD officials and decisions made with reference to them.\n\nHUD funded CDBG programs from 1977 to the present without having received from the City any special\nassessment of minority housing needs. It was not until 1981 that HUD required the City to prepare such an\nassessment. As of the time of trial, no such assessment had been submitted.\nHUD required the City to establish a fair housing office, but there was no evidence of any substantive results.\nHUD required the City to pass a fair housing ordinance in 1981, and indeed withheld CDBG funds for nearly a\nyear until an ordinance was finally passed. The enforcements provisions, however, remain ineffective until\npassage of enabling legislation by the General Court. There was no evidence of any continuing effort to secure\nsuch legislation.\nHUD has required the City to establish a special community disorders unit in the Boston Police Department and\nfunded this unit to the extent of $37,000. There was no evidence, other than unsupported opinion, to support the\nplaintiff's assertion that the funding is inadequate, unless I could draw an inference that it is by taking judicial\nnotice that racially related violence persists. Such an inference would depend upon competent evidence of a\n642 direct relationship between investment and result. No such evidence was offered and the proposition is not *642\nso self-evident as to be a proper subject of judicial notice.\nThe plaintiff alleges that HUD has supported various City programs designed to provide financial aid to home\nowners which were administered in such a way as to have a discriminatory impact adverse to minorities. These\nprograms are the Housing Improvement Program (\"HIP\"), its successor, the Housing Rehabilitation Program\n(\"HRP\"), and the Weatherization Improvement Program (\"WIP\"). The plaintiff also alleges that the § 312 program,\nwhich provided low cost home improvement loans, was subject in the South End to \"racial steering\".\nHIP, HRP and WIP provided subsidies for home improvement in various targeted areas of the City, including\nblack and white neighborhoods. Originally the subsidy was 20%. Because of low utilization of the program,\nhowever, percentages were increased to 40% and 50% for certain classes of homeowners. The subsidy was only\navailable as reimbursement, however, after the improvement was completed. It is this feature that the plaintiff\nidentifies as producing a discriminatory impact, because blacks and other minorities have less available capital\nand less borrowing capacity to carry out the project. In fact, for those parts of the program which provided 20%\nsubsidy, there were significantly more blacks that failed to complete the programs after initially registering for it\nthan whites or hispanics. When, however, the City increased the subsidy level to 40% and 50%, black\nparticipation and completion were proportionately higher than for other groups. The statistical evidence is\nconfusing and somewhat contradictory, but it is probable that the proportion of minority participation in these\nprograms was not significantly below the ratio of minority homeowners to white homeowners in the City.\nIn February, 1982, the City initiated a pilot program of home improvement subsidy with money available at the\noutset of the improvement project. There was no evidence at the time of trial as to the success of this program.\nIn my view, the evidence does not establish that it is more probable than not that the reimbursement feature of\nthe program was the significant cause for failure of black participation at the 20% level, though that is the opinion\nof plaintiff's expert. It seems at least as likely that the problem was the level of subsidy. In order to participate, the\nhomeowner had to come up with 80% of the cost of the improvement, which would not be reimbursed. When the\nsubsidy was increased, the proportion of black participation increased dramatically.\nThe exception to the foregoing was the administration of HIP in the South End. Registration for participation in\nHIP was on a neighborhood basis. The registration office for the South End was in Charlestown, not only on the\nother side of the City, but in an all white area believed by blacks, justifiably, to be a dangerous area for them to\ngo. Black participation in HIP in the South End was extremely low. It is the uncontradicted testimony of Mr.\nUpshur, HUD's Director of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, that as soon as HUD learned of this situation, it\nordered the City to move the office into the South End, which it did.\nThe South End is also alleged to be the location of racial steering in the administration of the § 312 low interest\nloan program. The plaintiff asks me to infer deliberate racial steering from the fact that loans to white owners\nwere all granted for location on the east, or downtown, side of Massachusetts Avenue (Old South End) and loans\n[3]\nto black owners were all on the other side (South Roxbury). Certainly racial steering is a possible hypothesis .\n\nThere is no evidence of black owners east of the Avenue or white owners west of the Avenue having been\nrefused loans, however. Moreover, while the white owners' loans were for locations clustered in a few blocks\nwhere there has been very active \"gentrification\", or return of middle class suburbanites, the black owners' loans\n643 were similarly clustered in a very small and presumably self-selected *643 area. Without more evidence, I cannot\nexclude the likely effect on market and neighborhood forces and consequently cannot infer that deliberate racial\nsteering in the administration of the program is the probable cause of the results described.\nHUD has approved four ongoing UDAG programs for the City: Lafayette Place, Charlestown Navy Yard, Boston\nArmy Base and Copley Place. All of these projects are either mercantile or industrial except Charlestown, which\nincludes luxury housing. No UDAG funds have been sought by the City or approved by HUD for low-income\nhousing for families. The UDAG grants have not been conditioned on the establishment of a fair housing program\nor the construction of new low-income housing. They have, however, been designed to improve the economic\nstrength of the City and to provide a large number of jobs.\nHUD had $1.7 million available to the City for acquisition of the \"Tent City\" site near Copley Square for the\npurpose of building racially integrated low-income housing for the people displaced by the Copley Place project,\nwhich was funded in part by UDAG. This housing has never been built.\nHUD has never promulgated standards of performance or regulations under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1968.\nAs a condition of the CDBGs, the City undertook to increase minority hiring and minority contracting. The levels\napproved by HUD were very low in comparison to the proportion of blacks in the population and applied only to\ndepartments receiving CDBG funds. The City has in fact substantially exceeded these requirements, although\nblack employees are not distributed throughout all departments. The Assessors Department, for instance,\nremains predominantly white. No such requirements were imposed with respect to UDAG projects.\nIn approving the City's annual reports, HUD has permitted the City to count rehabilitation of existing low-income\nfamily housing as if it were new construction, thus permitting the City to meet HUD guidelines even though new\nconstruction has disproportionately favored housing for the elderly in predominantly white neighborhoods.\nCONCLUSIONS OF FACT AND RULINGS OF LAW\nHUD's primary assignment under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended,\n42 U.S.C. § 5301(c), is to bring about\nThe development of viable urban communities, by providing decent housing and a suitable living\nenvironment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate\nincome.\nUnder § 109 of that Title (42 U.S.C. § 5309) and § 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §\n2000d),\nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\nIt is clear that HUD did not itself intentionally discriminate in its programs, and I do not understand the plaintiffs to\nclaim that it did. Their complaint is that HUD finances programs operated by the City that were either deliberately\ndiscriminatory or had a discriminatory effect.\nIt may be that the City's ineffective response to demands for the enforcement of fair housing, and such actions as\nplacing the § 312 registration office for the South End in Charlestown are tips of a concealed iceberg of masked\ndiscrimination throughout the City housing program, as the plaintiff's witnesses and many of HUD's own staff\nobviously suspect. As explained in the foregoing Findings of Fact, however, adequate proof of the existence of\nsuch discrimination was not forthcoming in the trial of this case. Judicial intervention may not be based only on\n\nsuspicion, no matter how historically justified. I conclude that the evidence does not warrant a finding that HUD\n644 financed City programs that were either intentionally discriminatory *644 or had a discriminatory impact.\nAccordingly, there is no need to discuss the precise scope of § 601 of Title VI and § 109 of Title I and the\nstandards to be applied in their enforcement. See, e.g., NAACP v. Medical Center, Inc., 657 F.2d 1322 (3rd\nCir.1981) for an exposition of the problems. The foregoing also precludes a finding for the plaintiff under its Fifth\nAmendment claim.\nPlaintiffs' general claims under Title I are difficult to assess because the defendants' mandate is so broad. While\nattention to the interests of low-income groups and minorities in particular is specifically mandated, it is a part of a\ngeneral directive to revitalize the nation's cities. The mix of commercial, industrial and housing construction, as\nwell as the balance between housing for the elderly and housing for families, raise questions of judgment which\nare not subject to this court's review.\nNevertheless, there is at least one specific standard that must be met under HUD's own regulations. As a\ncondition of the receipt of CDBG funds, the City is required to prepare a Community Development and Housing\nPlan. 24 C.F.R. § 570.300(b)(2). The Community Development and Housing Plan must identify \"any special\nneeds of identifiable segments of the lower income population\". 24 C.F.R. § 570.304(b). No minority needs\nassessment has ever been prepared by the City, although recently demanded by HUD. HUD has continued\n[4]\nCDBG funding for the City in violation of its own regulations.\nThe failure to secure a minority needs assessment not only violates HUD's regulations under Title I, but seriously\nimpedes HUD in carrying out its statutory mandate under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. §\n3601 et seq.), which requires HUD to promote fair (i.e., desegregated) housing in all federally financed projects.\nHUD has never published regulations under Title VIII, and this lack has discouraged local enforcement. While\nspecific standards are lacking, clearly Title VIII requires effective fair housing enforcement. The financing of\ndesegregated housing so that the housing stock is sufficiently large to give minority families a true choice of\nlocation seems to me to be a concomitant obligation of HUD under both Title VI of the 1964 Act and Title VIII of\nthe 1968 Act. Shannon v. HUD, 436 F.2d 809 (3rd Cir.1970); Garrett v. City of Hamtramck, 503 F.2d 1236 (6th\nCir.1974).\nAgain because of the diversity of HUD's mandate, and the very considerable level of discretion that must remain\nwith HUD in order for its program to operate, it is extremely difficult to quantify HUD legal obligations under these\nstatutes. In the case of the City of Boston, however, its efforts to ensure fair housing have been ineffective. It has\naccepted from the City cosmetic changes in the form of the creation of a Mayor's Office for Fair Housing and\nsome public relations efforts instead of genuine enforcement. It has not used any of its immense leverage under\nUDAG to provide adequate desegregated housing, except for Mission Park, which was not a project sponsored\nby the City. It has not even required construction of housing at the Tent City site, which is directly related to the\nCopley Place UDAG.\nI conclude that the defendant has not satisfied minimum levels of compliance with Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1968.\nAt the outset of this case, the parties agreed that they would withhold their requests for any specific relief or\nprecise form of judgment until my findings of fact, rulings and conclusions had been filed.\nAccordingly, the parties are ordered to submit proposed forms of judgment by May 26, 1983, after which the court\nwill hold a hearing, at the convenience of the parties.\n[1] Although Mr. Feaster's testimony was conclusory and unspecific, and often the fruit of some egregiously\nleading questions, it must be considered like any other in the absence of proper and timely objections.\n[2] Evidence on this point was limited to the fears of blacks. I take judicial notice of the other side of the coin.\n[3] This was in fact the hypothesis accepted by plaintiff's expert.\n\n[4] Also arguably in violation of the City's statutory obligation to provide a Housing Assistance Plan (\"HAP\"),\nalthough this is not clear.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

No. 78-850-S.\nUnited States District Court, D. Massachusetts.\nJune 23, 1989.\nClarification and Amendment of Judgment September 14, 1989.\n336623 *362*363 Natasha Lisman, Sugarman, Rogers, Barshak & Cohen, Boston, Mass., for plaintiff.\nChristine Roach, Asst. U.S. Atty., Boston, Mass., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER FOR JUDGMENT\nSKINNER, District Judge.\nThe plaintiff N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter (\"NAACP\") seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, on the grounds that\nthe Secretary and other officials of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(collectively \"HUD\") have failed to administer certain programs in the City of Boston \"in a manner affirmatively to\nfurther the policies of [the Federal Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968]\" (\"the Act\"), in\nviolation of HUD's obligations under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).\nBackground\nThe NAACP filed this action in April of 1978, both on its own account and as representative of blacks in\nMetropolitan Boston alleging that HUD had failed to carry out its statutory mandate to promote fair housing in\nconnection with its administration of housing and community development programs in the City of Boston (\"the\nCity\"). The plaintiff challenges HUD's granting of funds to the City under its Community Development Block Grant\n(\"CDBG\") and Urban Development Action Grant (\"UDAG\") programs, on the basis that its constituency has been\nand is being excluded from equal access to the benefits of the programs funded. The claim as to the CDBG funds\nis essentially that HUD has failed to impose and enforce adequate conditions in connection with its grants to the\nCity to promote fair housing goals. The complaint as to the UDAG funds has focused on HUD's failure to use its\nleverage to cause the City to increase the supply of affordable desegregated housing.\nA trial on the merits was commenced in 1982 after remand from the court of appeals reversing a judgment of\ndismissal of the UDAG claim. On April 27, 1983, I made findings of fact and rulings of law which are published at\n567 F.Supp. 637 (1983), and are restated in summary fashion at 624 F.Supp. 1083, 1084-85 (1985).\nIn those decisions I concluded that HUD did not intentionally discriminate in administering its programs, and that\nthe evidence did not warrant a finding that HUD financed City programs which were either intentionally\ndiscriminatory or had a discriminatory impact. Based on these findings and conclusions, I found that HUD had not\nviolated § 109 of Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5309, § 601 of Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, or the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\nI found that HUD was in violation of its own regulations, by continuing to furnish CDBG funds despite the City's\nfailure to submit a Community Development and Housing plan identifying the \"special needs\" of the lower income\npopulation, required under 24 C.F.R. 570.300(b) (\"the minority needs assessment\"). This omission significantly\nimpeded HUD's capacity to carry out its statutory mandate, prescribed by the Act, to promote fair housing in\n\nfederally financed projects. The City supplied a minority needs assessment on September 7, 1982, thus\npermitting HUD to continue financing its programs in compliance with its own regulations.\nThis left only the issue of HUD's compliance with its mandate under 42 U.S.C. 3608(e)(5), to \"administer the\nprograms and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the\npolicies of [the Act].\" While I found that HUD had failed its obligations in this regard, 624 F.Supp. at 1085\n(D.Mass.1985), I believed that I had no legal authority to redress such omissions under the Administrative\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551, et seq. (the \"APA\"), because HUD's compliance with this section was committed\nto the agency's discretion pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) and would require essentially managerial decisions\n364 which courts are ill-equipped to perform. *364 As this was the only remaining claim, I dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed my order dismissing the claim based on § 3608(e)(5), holding\nthat the pattern of inaction which comprised the alleged violation was not exempted from review under the APA.\nIn addition, the court discussed available remedies under the APA, and made it clear that I have broad discretion\nto tailor a remedy to the current circumstances. The court remanded the action, for consideration of appropriate\nremedies for HUD's violation of its statutory obligations, N.A.A.C.P. v. HUD, 817 F.2d 149, 160-1 (1st Cir.1987).\nI stayed the action on July 4, 1987 and ordered the parties to participate in mediation proceedings under the\nauspices of the Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice (\"CRS\"). In a status conference held\nDecember 14, 1988 the parties reported that attempts to reach a resolution through mediation had failed, despite\nthe heroic efforts of the mediators.\nIn accordance with the court of appeals' directive, I solicited submissions from the parties as to any\ndevelopments in the housing situation in the City since the 1982 trial, and for suggestions as to an appropriate\nremedy. To this end, I directed the plaintiff to submit a motion for entry of judgment, together with a proposed\ndecree.\nThe plaintiff has submitted such a motion, together with a proposed order setting forth the declaratory and\ninjunctive relief it currently seeks. HUD has not submitted a counterproposal but opposes the plaintiff's motion on\nthe grounds that it is not liable for any violation and that the relief requested is both beyond my power to award\nand inappropriate to the facts of this case.\nCurrent Conditions\nIn addition to failing to produce any agreement on remedy, the mediation proceedings were barren of useful\ninformation as well, in that no stipulations, factual findings by the mediator or any record derived from those\nproceedings has been made available to the court. The parties have been unable to reach any stipulations\nthemselves as to the current situation. While the plaintiff has offered to submit testimony of an expert who would\ntestify that barriers to open housing have not diminished since 1983, and that HUD has not played an active role\nin addressing those barriers, the sole evidentiary supplementation to the record before me is the affidavit of\nHarold Thompson, HUD's Deputy Regional Administrator in Boston, which is offered to report on HUD's\nconditioning and monitoring activities in the seven years since the trial.\nIn December of 1985, two of the housing projects for which the plaintiff sought approval, Winslow Court and\nHarbor (Columbia) Point, received financing through the interaction of HUD, the City and agencies of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition, the City has committed $31,000,000 of its anticipated $31,300,000\nrepayment from the Copley Place UDAG to the construction of Tent City, a project combining low and middle\nincome housing with commercial use, located between Copley Square and the South End. Winslow Court is\nlocated in Roxbury. No specific information as to the percentage of black residents in these projects, or their\nincome levels have been offered.\nOf approximately $26 million in CDBG funds allocated to the City for FY 1981, HUD withheld $13 million of these\nfunds, conditioning their release on the City's performance of certain actions, including the City Council's\nenactment of a fair housing ordinance and a home rule petition, or some equivalent enforcement activities; a\nminority needs assessment; and the design of activities to address minority housing needs and to set standards\n\nto assess minority housing benefits. In 1983, HUD determined that the City had fulfilled these conditions, and\nreleased the funds. Currently all but $33,000 of these monies has been spent or obligated by the City.\nHUD has imposed no new conditions or assurances in connection with provision of CDBG or UDAG funds since\nthe lifting of the CDBG conditions in 1983. It represents that it has recently monitored Boston's performance in\n365 the CDBG program *365 with respect to furthering fair housing and has found its performance to be acceptable. It\nfurther states that it has no evidence that the City has failed to comply with any legal requirements of either\nprogram with respect to fair housing since removal of those conditions and represents that it has no current\nintention to impose any conditions, assurances or other sanctions upon the City in connection with its receipt or\nexpenditure of CDBG and UDAG funds.\nAs evidence of the City's commitment to fair housing, HUD cites its use of CDBG monies to fund the Fair\nHousing Commission, which was created in compliance with the 1981 conditions. The purpose of the commission\nis \"to increase housing opportunities for minorities and female-headed [sic] households, and to reduce housing\ndiscrimination.\" However, HUD does not point to any evidence that these laudable goals have actually been\nfurthered by the commission's activities, but contends that it has met its obligations to ensure enforcement of fair\nhousing goals by \"formally mandating the strengthening of the City's enforcement efforts as a condition to\nBoston's receipt of federal block funds.\" The plaintiffs maintain that the Commission lacks effective enforcement\ncapability, since no legislation has been passed to give it the necessary jurisdiction and enforcement power and\nthe commission operates on the basis of complaints only.\nThompson also reports statistics related to minority participation in various home improvement programs. No\nevidence has been submitted that the identified programs affect patterns of segregation, and they appear to be\ndesigned to provide assistance to individuals where they are currently located.\nWith the exceptions noted above, I shall assume that the conditions described in my previous findings of fact still\nobtain.\nLiability\nIn my prior opinions, I found that HUD had failed to satisfy the minimum levels of compliance required by § 3608\n(e)(5) in two respects. First, the agency did not require the City to establish an effective fair housing enforcement\nprogram in the face of its knowledge of pervasive racial discrimination in the City. Second, despite its knowledge\nthat a housing emergency existed which had a disproportionate impact on low income black families, HUD did\nnot condition its provision of federal funds, specifically UDAG funds on construction of affordable integrated\npublic housing. 624 F.Supp. at 1085.\nHUD has presented no new evidence which would warrant modification of my conclusion that it violated the\nminimal obligations imposed by its governing statute, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).\nAs grounds for disputing liability, HUD contends that in its order remanding this action, the court of appeals\ncommands me to adopt a narrower view of HUD's obligations and that under this lesser standard it must be\nfound not liable. I find no support for HUD's position in the text of the court's opinion. HUD's argument that the\ncourt of appeals adopted a narrow test of liability, amounting to a \"duty to consider\" appears to be based on the\ncourt's discussion of Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530 (11th Cir.1984), a case on which the\ndefendant relied in its argument for a narrow view of its liability. The court rejected this argument and held that\nthe standard set forth in that case, \"even if overly narrow, still does not support the government's view of HUD's\nduties.\" 817 F.2d at 156.\nRemedies\nPursuant to my order at the December, 1988 status conference, the plaintiff submitted a proposed final decree\nsetting forth the declaratory and injunctive relief it seeks. HUD has filed no counterproposal, contenting itself with\nchallenging the legitimacy and efficacy of any suggested remedy for the wrongs alleged.\n\nIn the absence of stipulations or compromise on remedy, I must rely on the findings and conclusions embodied in\nmy prior decisions and the meager supplementation of the record filed by the parties in connection with this\nmotion.\n366 *366 \"Of course, the court faces the difficult task of avoiding both remedies that may be too intrusive, interfering\nwith HUD's ability to carry out its basic grant-awarding mission, and those that may prove to be ineffective. This\ndifficulty is not, however, unsolvable.\" NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 159. In its order of remand, the court of\n[1]\nappeals described my remedial powers under these circumstances with celestial generality.  I am empowered\nto review and remedy patterns of inaction under both sections 706(1) and 706(2)(A) of the APA. In the absence of\nany positive response from HUD, any meaningful dialogue between the parties or any guidance from the court of\nappeals, I must make an independent judgment as to which, if any, of the plaintiff's proposals will effectuate the\npurposes of the Act.\n1. Declaratory Relief\nThe bulk of the declaratory relief requested tracks my 1983 findings of fact, specifically that HUD failed to comply\nwith the minimal requirements of § 3608(e)(5) by failing to (1) promulgate regulations and guidelines setting forth\nstandards for HUD's administration and the recipients' use of funds; (2) secure a minority needs assessment in a\ntimely manner; (3) finance the increase of desegregated housing stock to give minority families meaningful\nchoice of location, and (4) require effective fair housing enforcement by the City. These declarations are\nsupported by my previous findings.\nIn addition the plaintiff seeks a declaration that metropolitan area relief is necessary, thus laying the groundwork\nfor its proposal that HUD be obliged to assist urban black households to obtain access to publicly assisted\nhousing in the City's suburbs. The support for this request is my 1983 finding that members of the plaintiff's\nconstituency desire to relocate to the suburbs, in part due to the lack of safe housing in white urban areas, and\nthat HUD has attempted to assist them in doing so. I did not make findings which would warrant a conclusion that\nHUD failed to carry out its obligations in connection with housing assistance beyond the City limits. At this point,\nhowever, the task is to delineate a broad remedial plan to redress the whole range of the defendant's default,\nwhich includes the failure to encourage the creation of desegregated housing to correct the deficiency in the\nCity's housing stock. Measures designed to supplement that stock with affordable desegregated housing in the\nsuburbs appear to me to be appropriate under these circumstances.\nAccordingly a declaratory judgment shall enter as requested by the plaintiff.\n2. Injunctive Relief in General\nHUD argues for stringent limitations on the remedy I may devise, and raises a number of general and specific\nobjections to the injunctive relief the plaintiff requests. HUD argues generally that the requested relief is beyond\nthe relief authorized by the APA for three reasons.\nFirst, it argues the funds at issue when this case was brought have already been disbursed, and therefore its\nallegedly improper acts or omissions are no longer redressable as a practical matter. To similar effect is HUD's\nposition that changed circumstances generally have mooted the need for judicial relief, pointing to recent use of\nits grants and leveraging power to generate affordable open housing and its belief that the City is currently in\ncompliance with its obligations.\nEvidence submitted by HUD as to the City's recent use of its CDBG funds demonstrates that there have been\nattempts to address the needs of minority and lower-income individuals for affordable new and rehabilitated\nhousing. However, there is no evidence as to the adequacy of these efforts to remedy the overall lack of an\nadequate supply of affordable integrated housing in Boston.\nThe fact that this litigation has been pending for over a decade is no reason to deny the plaintiff relief, particularly\n367 in the absence of any showing that conditions have substantially improved. Despite my *367 invitation, the\n\ndefendant has not presented sufficient evidence to assure me that the conditions which gave rise to the suit have\nbeen adequately ameliorated, or that the proposed relief is unnecessary. On the contrary, the plaintiff maintains\nthat there is still no meaningful enforcement mechanism in place because of the lack of enabling legislation which\nwould give enforcement power to the Boston Fair Housing Commission.\nMoreover, this case is distinguishable from the cases on which defendant relies because the conditions\nexacerbated by HUD's pattern of inaction apparently continue to exist and are currently remediable. This is not a\ncase involving a single improper funding decision, for which there is no longer a viable remedy. See, e.g., South\nEast Lake View Neighbors v. HUD, 685 F.2d 1027 (7th Cir.1982), holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to\nenjoin federal funding when the project at issue was nearly completed, since the relief the plaintiffs requested\nwould be valueless at that stage of the proceedings.\nIn addition, the fact that the 1977-81 funds have been disbursed does not deprive HUD of all leverage over its\ngrantees. Its control of current and future grant funds gives the agency leverage to remedy past and current\nnoncompliance with fair housing goals. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 5304, 5311; Davis v. HUD, 627 F.2d 942, 945 (9th\nCir.1980), in which the court held that an action challenging HUD approval of a block grant was not mooted by\nthe fact that the grantee had already received and expended the funds, since the grantee could be obliged to\nsatisfy goals not met in the past in order to qualify for additional block grants; see also, Clients' Council v. Pierce,\n711 F.2d 1406 (8th Cir.1983), in which a remedy directing HUD to issue orders to the local housing authority to\ndesegregate its housing projects was not barred by the fact that the authority was not a party to the action, since\nthe court had \"no reason to believe that the [local authority] would refuse to comply with a specific directive\nissued by HUD at the direction of the district court.\" Clients' Council, supra, 711 F.2d at 1426.\nSecond, HUD argues that I am barred from fashioning a remedy which compels the agency to perform any act it\nis not independently obliged to perform under the FHA or its own regulations. HUD confuses the issue of liability\nwith that of an appropriate remedy once liability is fixed. HUD's specific obligations under its governing statute\nand regulations are relevant to the question of liability. But once liability has been found, I am not limited in\nfashioning a remedy to ordering HUD to perform acts which would be required of it even absent a finding of past\nculpability. This is implicit in the concept of remedial action.\nThird, HUD reinvokes its narrow construction of the order of remand, to argue that any relief must be narrowly\ntailored to impose a \"duty to consider,\" since this is its \"only conceivably `plausible' violation.\" As I have already\nmade clear, I do not agree with HUD that the order of remand fixes such a constricted view of its statutory\nobligations or of the range of available remedies.\nIn creating appropriate remedies, however, prudence requires the acknowledgement of certain political\nimperatives. The appropriation of funds for urban development is committed to Congress, and the allocation of\nsuch funds among the various sections of the country is committed to the discretion of the defendant. Imposition\nof restrictions that make Boston an unattractive candidate for federal funding may ultimately defeat the laudable\npurposes which the plaintiff seeks to achieve.\n3. Specific Remedial Measures\n(a) Funding of Additional Projects\nPlaintiff seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide new funding for the construction of affordable\ndesegregated housing and the increase of available rent subsidies, all to be allocated according to specifications\nto be supplied by the plaintiff. HUD argues that any decree which would require HUD to fund particular housing\nprojects and supply rental subsidies are foreclosed by sovereign immunity, based on the distinction drawn\n368 between *368 \"money damages\" and \"specific relief\" set out in Bowen v. Massachusetts, ___ U.S. ___, 108 S.Ct.\n2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988). The APA does not ordinarily empower a court to order an agency to fund\nparticular projects or to reach particular results. See, e.g., NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 160; United States\nv. Yonkers Board of Education, 594 F.Supp. 466 (S.D. N.Y.1984), contrasting suits to enjoin funding, which are\nauthorized by the APA, with those to provide funding, which are not.\n\nAs I have pointed out, the appropriation of funds is exclusively a matter for the Congress and the allocation of\nfunds among the various sections of the country is committed to the discretion of the Secretary. N.A.A.C.P.,\nBoston Chapter v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514 (1st Cir.1979). I find that the portions of the proposed decree which seek\nto order HUD to provide funding are barred by sovereign immunity, and are inconsistent with the statutory\nscheme for the implementation of the UDAG and CBDG programs. Accordingly I am obliged to reject this\nsuggested remedy.\n(b) Metropolitan Area Relief\nThe plaintiff seeks injunctive relief compelling HUD to require private landlords of HUD-assisted housing\nthroughout the metropolitan area to participate in an affirmative marketing program targeting low income\nminorities now living in Boston. Such a program would be administered under the auspices of the Boston Fair\nHousing Commission. In my opinion this form of remedy is warranted because of (a) HUD's failure to encourage\nthe construction of integrated housing within the City and (b) because there is a lack of safe housing for persons\nof color in the white areas of the City. The remedy sought is in my opinion a reasonable response to the\nconditions which I found to exist, even though I made no specific findings concerning suburban housing\nopportunities.\nThe requested order would not require the defendant to impose conditions on local authorities over which it has\nno control, cf. Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 758 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir.1985), nor to restructure\nunits of local government, cf. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). In my\nopinion, an order requiring the defendant to condition the federal funding of private suburban housing projects is\nlegal, feasible and an appropriate remedy for the defendant's default. Hills v. Gatreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 305-6, 96\nS.Ct. 1538, 1550, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976).\n(c) Fair Housing Conditions\nThe plaintiff seeks an order that HUD impose a series of Fair Housing Conditions on the City and\nCommonwealth, under any grant programs wherein it has power to impose conditions on grantees. These\nconditions include promulgation of legislation eliminating the current exemption of five or fewer unit housing from\nthe reach of The Fair Housing Ordinance, and granting the Fair Housing Commission enforcement powers; the\nparticipation of all managers and owners of state or City assisted housing in the metropolitan area in rental\nassistance and affirmative marketing programs; and the implementation of an enforcement program.\nHUD argues that the plaintiff lacks standing to seek relief from these entities, because they are not defendants in\nthis action. This argument fails for the same reason as HUD's previous standing argument, i.e., the relief sought\nis obtainable from HUD, which is a party to this action. At least insofar as the conditions requested promote\nintegrated fair housing, they are permissible.\nHUD further argues that it cannot legally condition its grants to the Commonwealth and the City, because the Act\nand applicable regulations require as a prerequisite to conditioning that the grantee be found to have failed to\ncomply with its duties.\nSection 5304(d) gives the Secretary the power to deal with a grantee's current and future performance. This\nprovision requires the Secretary, on at least an annual basis, to make reviews and audits of a grantee's activities,\n369 and permits him to *369 make to \"make appropriate adjustments in the amount of the annual grants\" in\naccordance with his findings. 42 U.S.C. § 5304(d). Section 5311 addresses past noncompliance, and requires\nthe Secretary to impose conditions if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, he finds that the grantee \"has failed\nto comply substantially with any provision of this chapter ...\". 42 U.S.C. § 5311(a). Use of this latter provision is\nmandated for cases of past noncompliance which do not affect current or future performance, but it is sparingly\ninvoked because of the procedural safeguards for the grantee attendant to its exercise. See, e.g., Kansas v.\nHUD, 861 F.2d 739, 742-44 (D.C.Cir.1988).\n\nThe process HUD points to is not required under section 5304, which deals with current noncompliance. Since\nthe plaintiff claims that the failure to pass enabling legislation endowing the Boston Fair Housing Commission\nwith jurisdiction and enforcement powers constitutes current nonperformance of its fair housing obligations,\nsection 5304 may be invoked rather than section 5311.\nThe City's 1981 CDBG application was premised on the implementation of a fair housing plan, which included\nprovision for meaningful enforcement of minority access to housing opportunities. While a fair housing ordinance\nhas been passed, and a fair housing commission created, enabling legislation has never been passed which\ngives the commission enforcement power. These measures appear to be ineffective to fulfill the City's\nundertaking, and it is unclear why HUD deemed them sufficient to demonstrate compliance. Accordingly, there\nalso seems to be valid grounds for invoking the agency's conditioning power under section 5311, since it does\nnot appear that the City ever was in genuine compliance with these conditions.\nHUD admits, moreover, that the conditions and assurances it imposed beginning in 1977, were imposed without\nany findings that the City discriminated in its HUD funded programs. Given this representation, and the fact that\nthe conditions included the passage of legislation, I find the defendant's procedural and federalism arguments\nagainst \"hold[ing] the City and State's block grant `hostage' until they enact desired legislation\" unconvincing.\nIn addition, HUD contends that such a condition would be impermissible since it is obliged to award UDAG funds\non the basis of a national competition utilizing uniform selection criteria, under 42 U.S.C. § 5318(d)(1), and that it\nis expressly barred from discriminating in such allocation of funds based on the type of activity involved, under 42\nU.S.C. § 5318(r). In my opinion that provision has absolutely nothing to do with HUD's obligation to promote the\nfair housing goals expressly declared in the Act.\nAn order shall enter substantially in accordance with the plaintiff's request.\n(d) Promulgation of Regulations\nThe plaintiff seeks an order that HUD promulgate regulations and guidelines which set forth standards for HUD's\nadministration and recipients' use of funds under HUD's housing and community development programs and\nactivities in accordance with Title VIII. Such an order is designed to facilitate meaningful compliance with and\nenforcement of fair housing goals. The request tracks my 1983 finding, which the plaintiff seeks to embody in the\ndeclaratory portion of the decree, that HUD failed to promulgate standards of performance or regulations under\nTitle VIII.\nIn addition to challenging the propriety of this demand, HUD represents that such rules and handbooks are\nalready in existence, citing as examples, Handbook No. 800.3: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Monitoring of\nCommunity Development Programs; 24 C.F.R. §§ 570.900, et seq. In addition, HUD points to recent statutory\nand regulatory amendments which impose more stringent standards on recipients of Fair Housing Assistance\nProgram Funds. The plaintiff concedes that new regulations have been proposed, but argues that they are\n370 inadequate in that they relate solely to the processing of private individual claims of discrimination, *370 and give\nno guidance to HUD or grantee administrators.\nThe court of appeals expressly noted that my remedial power under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), includes the\npower to compel the Secretary to promulgate regulations to carry out the intent of Congress, where he has failed\nto exercise his discretion to do so. NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 160. Nevertheless, I am very reluctant to\nadd to the existing mountain of federal rules and regulations. I am only concerned with the specific local problems\nraised in this case. In my opinion the proper articulation of the conditions described above in each grant of HUD\nfunds will be sufficient to the occasion.\nORDER\nA declaratory judgment and final decree shall enter forthwith in accordance with the foregoing.\n\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND FINAL DECREE\nAfter a trial in this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and after consideration of the parties' submissions\nwith respect to remedies and in accordance with the memorandum filed herewith:\nI. Declaratory Relief\nIt is Declared that:\nA. During the period 1977 to 1982, in administering its programs and activities relating to housing and urban\ndevelopment in the City of Boston (\"the City\"), HUD did not satisfy minimum levels of compliance with Title VIII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5), as amended, to administer its programs and activities in a\nmanner affirmatively to further the policies of fair housing by:\n1. Failing to promulgate regulations or guidelines which adequately set forth standards for HUD's\nadministration and recipients' use of funds under HUD programs;\n2. Failing to secure a minority needs assessment from the City in a timely manner;\n3. Failing adequately to condition and monitor use of its funding by grantees and recipients, so as\nto assure the use of these monies to produce an adequate supply of affordable integrated family\nhousing; and\n4. Failing to require effective fair housing enforcement by the City.\nB. In light of HUD's failure to comply with its statutory mandate, and the resultant lack of affordable desegregated\nhousing, Metropolitan Area relief is appropriate under these circumstances, and to the extent provided in this\nDecree.\nII. Remedial Order\nIt is Ordered that:\nA. Metropolitan Area Relief\nHUD shall require the owners and managers of any assisted public or private housing within any city or town\nwithin the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area, including Boston (\"the Metropolitan Area\"), to participate fully in\navailable programs designed to facilitate access to suburban housing opportunities for low-income minority\nhouseholds now living in the City. These programs shall include, without limitation, the listing requirements and\naffirmative marketing programs created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this Decree.\nThe requirements of this Decree shall apply with equal force to all assisted housing in the Metropolitan Area.\n\"Assisted Housing\" means housing the cost of whose purchase, development, operation or rehabilitation is\nsubsidized in whole or in part with public funds or other resources, whether such funds or resources derive from\nfederal, state or local government.\nIn enforcing this Decree, HUD shall use any power it possesses to impose conditions on grantees, recipients, or\nbeneficiaries, pursuant to any grant or any other program.\n\nB. Fair Housing Conditions Upon Funding to the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts.\n371 Following entry of this Decree, HUD shall include in any approval of an application *371 for funding by the\nCommonwealth, under any grant or other program administered by HUD pursuant to which it has the power to\nimpose conditions upon grantees or recipients, the following conditions:\n1. That the Commonwealth require owners and operators of any state-assisted public or private housing available\nfor rental or sale in the Metropolitan Area to participate fully in programs designed to enhance access to low-\nincome housing by Black households, including but not limited to, Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing and\naffirmative marketing programs created pursuant to Sections II.C.3 of this Decree.\n2. That the Commonwealth promulgate legislation granting the Boston Fair Housing Commission (\"the\nCommission\") effective enforcement powers, including but not limited to, the power to issue subpoenas, levy\nfines and institute civil actions;\n3. That the Commonwealth prepare and provide such reports and statements regarding assisted housing in the\nMetropolitan Area as are required from time to time by HUD. Such submissions shall include, without limitation,\nreports on the racial and family composition of state-assisted housing, and a statement of the projected use of\nfunds and community development plan, as required by 42 U.S.C. § 5304.\nC. Fair Housing Conditions Upon Funding to the City\nFollowing entry of this Decree, HUD shall include in any approval of an application for funding by the City, under\nany grant or other program administered by HUD pursuant to which it has the power to impose conditions upon\ngrantees or recipients, the following conditions:\n1. That the City require the owners and operators of any City-assisted public or private housing available for\nrental or sale to participate fully in programs designed to enhance access to low-income housing by low-income\nBlack households, including but not limited to Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing and affirmative marketing\nprograms created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this Decree.\n2. That the City promulgate an amendment to its Fair Housing Ordinance eliminating the exemption of housing\nconsisting of five or fewer units;\n3. That within 60 days after HUD's approval of the application, the City design and submit to HUD and the plaintiff\nand, upon HUD's approval, implement a Fair Housing Program, to be administered by the Commission, including,\nwithout limitation, the following components:\na. A Boston Housing Opportunity Clearing Center, in which shall be listed all assisted public or\nprivate housing units available for sale or rental in the Metropolitan Area, which are required to be\nlisted by this Decree or any other authority, or any private units which are offered for listing by their\nowners or operators;\nb. A Fair Housing Law Enforcement Program, designed to identify and alleviate racially\ndiscriminatory practices in the sale and rental of housing in the City, which shall, without limitation:\n(i) Hear and investigate complaints of discriminatory practices;\n(ii) Bring administrative and judicial proceedings against persons engaging in discriminatory\npractices;\n(iii) Assist victims of discrimination by providing information as to rights and available remedies,\nand referrals to legal services organizations and private attorneys available to assist in\ndiscrimination claims.\n\nc. An Affirmative Marketing Program pursuant to 24 C.F.R. 200.620, which requires the owners\nand operators of assisted housing in the City to pursue affirmative fair housing marketing policies\nin soliciting buyers and tenants, in determining their eligibility, and in concluding sales and rental\ntransactions.\nThe Plan shall be designed to enhance the availability to persons of color of housing in\nneighborhoods which are now predominantly white. The goal of the Plan and its measure of\nsuccess shall be to achieve a racial composition in assisted housing, in neighborhoods which are\n372 predominantly *372 white, which reflects the racial composition of the City as a whole.\nd. A Fair Housing Public Education Program designed to make use of various public forums, such\nas broadcast media, bill boards, and community and social service organizations, to inform the\npublic of rights and available remedies under applicable fair housing and anti-discrimination laws\nand regulations, including but not limited to, the existence and functions of the Commission, the\nClearing Center, and of the other components of the Fair Housing Program;\n4. That the City prepare and submit to HUD such reports and statements regarding assisted housing as are\nrequired from time to time by HUD. Such submissions shall include, without limitation, a report on the racial and\nfamily composition of assisted housing, and a plan for the projected use of funds for community development, as\nrequired by 42 U.S.C. § 5304.\nD. Stock of Affordable Housing\n1. HUD shall use its best efforts and available resources to increase the supply of affordable integrated family\nhousing in the City, whether public, public-assisted, or private.\n2. HUD shall not agree to any disposition of HUD-assisted housing which has the effect of reducing the supply of\naffordable family housing in the City available as of the effective date of this Decree.\nIII. Monitoring and Reports\nCommencing three months after the effective date of this Decree and every six months thereafter, HUD shall\nsubmit to the court and serve upon the plaintiff:\nA. A report prepared by HUD or its grantees setting forth the current racial makeup, family composition and\nvacancy rate of HUD assisted housing projects or units in the City;\nB. A report describing the activities carried out and the results achieved in implementing this Decree.\nIV. Retention of Jurisdiction\nA. Jurisdiction is retained by the court for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff and HUD to apply to the court at\nany time for such further orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction, implementation,\nmodification or enforcement of this Decree.\nB. At any time after the fifth anniversary of the effective date, either HUD or the plaintiff may request the court to\nreview the progress made in implementing this Decree, and, based upon such review, to modify or terminate any\nand all rights or obligations provided therein.\nC. If HUD is unable to comply with its obligations under this Decree, for lack of authorization or any other reason,\nthe plaintiff may move for such comparable alternative relief as is appropriate.\n\nCLARIFICATION AND AMENDMENT OF JUDGMENT\nOn June 23, 1989, I issued a Declaratory Judgment and Final Decree (\"the Decree\"), setting forth the relief to be\naccorded the plaintiff N.A.A.C.P. The federal defendants move to amend the judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.\n59(e), in order to clarify HUD's obligations under the Decree and to modify certain aspects of the Decree which\nmight defeat its objectives. In general, the decree intentionally broadens the obligations of the defendants. It is a\nremedial decree as opposed to an order enforcing existing obligations.\n1. Inclusion of Section 8 Housing in Metropolitan Area Relief\nThe omission of a specific reference to the Section 8 rental subsidy program in section II.A of the Decree, dealing\nwith Metropolitan Area Relief, does not indicate an intent to exclude the program from this portion of the Decree.\nSection II.A, ¶ 1 sentence 2 is amended to read:\n\"These programs shall include, without limitation, Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing\n373 requirements and affirmative *373 marketing programs created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this\nDecree.\"\n2. The Meaning of \"Assisted Housing\"\nHUD seeks clarification of the terms \"Assisted Housing\" and \"HUD-Assisted Housing.\" I hereby modify the\ndecree to expressly include within the definition of these terms (1) housing assisted by government insurance of\nprivate mortgage loans, and (2) housing created or developed under CDBG programs.\n3. \"Power to Condition\" Absolute or Conditional\nHUD questions whether the phrase \"power to condition\" in section II of the Decree leaves it the discretion to\nrefrain from conditioning programs with respect to which it has not made the factual findings normally prerequisite\nto the exercise of conditioning power.\nThe direction that HUD \"use any power it possesses to impose conditions\" applies with respect to any HUD\nprograms within the geographical reach of the Decree whose governing statutes and regulations include\nconditioning power. I expressly rule that HUD's obligation to impose the conditions set forth in the Decree is not\nlimited to circumstances in which it has made the factual findings normally prerequisite to the exercise of that\npower, and that it does not have the discretion to refrain from imposing the specified conditions.\n4. The Meaning of \"Available Resources\"\nThe term \"Available Resources\" refers to funds and other resources available to HUD at a Regional level, not\nnationwide.\nMy order that HUD \"use its best efforts and available resources\" to increase the supply of affordable integrated\nhousing, in section II.D of the Decree, does not direct the agency to make additional funding available or\notherwise to channel resources to the Boston Metropolitan Area beyond what the region would otherwise receive,\nbut only to maximize the extent to which available funds are used to provide such housing.\n5. Meaning of \"Affordable Housing\"\nSection II.D of the Decree obliges HUD to promote the supply of \"affordable integrated family housing\" in Boston.\nHUD requests modification of the Decree to define the term \"affordable,\" to facilitate its calculation of the size of\n\nthe current housing stock. HUD suggests a definition with respect to rental housing, but has no specific definition\nto proffer in the context of home ownership.\nI hereby modify the Decree to include the following, as section II.D.3:\na. \"Affordable housing\" means housing whose effective cost to a very low, low or moderate\nincome household does not exceed 30% of such household's combined net income.\nb. \"Very low-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not more than\n50% of the median income for the City of Boston.\nc. \"Low-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not less than 50%\nand not more than 80% of the median income for the City of Boston.\nd. \"Moderate-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not less than\n80% and not more than 95% of the median income for the City of Boston.\n6. References to \"Persons of Color\" and \"Blacks\"\nThe reference to \"persons of color\" is intentional, and will stand.\n7. Exemptions of Fair Housing Programs\nThe following HUD programs or actions are exempt from the Decree's conditioning requirements, since as\npresently constituted these programs support the remedial goals embodied in the Decree.\na. The approval of funds by HUD under the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP);\n374 *374 b. The execution of contracts between HUD's Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Office\n(FHEO) and a city or state agency, to perform fair housing investigations for HUD.\n[1] \"The decision of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\" 817 F.2d at 161.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

No. 78-850-S.\nUnited States District Court, D. Massachusetts.\nJune 23, 1989.\nClarification and Amendment of Judgment September 14, 1989.\n336623 *362*363 Natasha Lisman, Sugarman, Rogers, Barshak & Cohen, Boston, Mass., for plaintiff.\nChristine Roach, Asst. U.S. Atty., Boston, Mass., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER FOR JUDGMENT\nSKINNER, District Judge.\nThe plaintiff N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter (\"NAACP\") seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, on the grounds that\nthe Secretary and other officials of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(collectively \"HUD\") have failed to administer certain programs in the City of Boston \"in a manner affirmatively to\nfurther the policies of [the Federal Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968]\" (\"the Act\"), in\nviolation of HUD's obligations under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).\nBackground\nThe NAACP filed this action in April of 1978, both on its own account and as representative of blacks in\nMetropolitan Boston alleging that HUD had failed to carry out its statutory mandate to promote fair housing in\nconnection with its administration of housing and community development programs in the City of Boston (\"the\nCity\"). The plaintiff challenges HUD's granting of funds to the City under its Community Development Block Grant\n(\"CDBG\") and Urban Development Action Grant (\"UDAG\") programs, on the basis that its constituency has been\nand is being excluded from equal access to the benefits of the programs funded. The claim as to the CDBG funds\nis essentially that HUD has failed to impose and enforce adequate conditions in connection with its grants to the\nCity to promote fair housing goals. The complaint as to the UDAG funds has focused on HUD's failure to use its\nleverage to cause the City to increase the supply of affordable desegregated housing.\nA trial on the merits was commenced in 1982 after remand from the court of appeals reversing a judgment of\ndismissal of the UDAG claim. On April 27, 1983, I made findings of fact and rulings of law which are published at\n567 F.Supp. 637 (1983), and are restated in summary fashion at 624 F.Supp. 1083, 1084-85 (1985).\nIn those decisions I concluded that HUD did not intentionally discriminate in administering its programs, and that\nthe evidence did not warrant a finding that HUD financed City programs which were either intentionally\ndiscriminatory or had a discriminatory impact. Based on these findings and conclusions, I found that HUD had not\nviolated § 109 of Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5309, § 601 of Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, or the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\nI found that HUD was in violation of its own regulations, by continuing to furnish CDBG funds despite the City's\nfailure to submit a Community Development and Housing plan identifying the \"special needs\" of the lower income\npopulation, required under 24 C.F.R. 570.300(b) (\"the minority needs assessment\"). This omission significantly\nimpeded HUD's capacity to carry out its statutory mandate, prescribed by the Act, to promote fair housing in\n\nfederally financed projects. The City supplied a minority needs assessment on September 7, 1982, thus\npermitting HUD to continue financing its programs in compliance with its own regulations.\nThis left only the issue of HUD's compliance with its mandate under 42 U.S.C. 3608(e)(5), to \"administer the\nprograms and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the\npolicies of [the Act].\" While I found that HUD had failed its obligations in this regard, 624 F.Supp. at 1085\n(D.Mass.1985), I believed that I had no legal authority to redress such omissions under the Administrative\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551, et seq. (the \"APA\"), because HUD's compliance with this section was committed\nto the agency's discretion pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) and would require essentially managerial decisions\n364 which courts are ill-equipped to perform. *364 As this was the only remaining claim, I dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed my order dismissing the claim based on § 3608(e)(5), holding\nthat the pattern of inaction which comprised the alleged violation was not exempted from review under the APA.\nIn addition, the court discussed available remedies under the APA, and made it clear that I have broad discretion\nto tailor a remedy to the current circumstances. The court remanded the action, for consideration of appropriate\nremedies for HUD's violation of its statutory obligations, N.A.A.C.P. v. HUD, 817 F.2d 149, 160-1 (1st Cir.1987).\nI stayed the action on July 4, 1987 and ordered the parties to participate in mediation proceedings under the\nauspices of the Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice (\"CRS\"). In a status conference held\nDecember 14, 1988 the parties reported that attempts to reach a resolution through mediation had failed, despite\nthe heroic efforts of the mediators.\nIn accordance with the court of appeals' directive, I solicited submissions from the parties as to any\ndevelopments in the housing situation in the City since the 1982 trial, and for suggestions as to an appropriate\nremedy. To this end, I directed the plaintiff to submit a motion for entry of judgment, together with a proposed\ndecree.\nThe plaintiff has submitted such a motion, together with a proposed order setting forth the declaratory and\ninjunctive relief it currently seeks. HUD has not submitted a counterproposal but opposes the plaintiff's motion on\nthe grounds that it is not liable for any violation and that the relief requested is both beyond my power to award\nand inappropriate to the facts of this case.\nCurrent Conditions\nIn addition to failing to produce any agreement on remedy, the mediation proceedings were barren of useful\ninformation as well, in that no stipulations, factual findings by the mediator or any record derived from those\nproceedings has been made available to the court. The parties have been unable to reach any stipulations\nthemselves as to the current situation. While the plaintiff has offered to submit testimony of an expert who would\ntestify that barriers to open housing have not diminished since 1983, and that HUD has not played an active role\nin addressing those barriers, the sole evidentiary supplementation to the record before me is the affidavit of\nHarold Thompson, HUD's Deputy Regional Administrator in Boston, which is offered to report on HUD's\nconditioning and monitoring activities in the seven years since the trial.\nIn December of 1985, two of the housing projects for which the plaintiff sought approval, Winslow Court and\nHarbor (Columbia) Point, received financing through the interaction of HUD, the City and agencies of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition, the City has committed $31,000,000 of its anticipated $31,300,000\nrepayment from the Copley Place UDAG to the construction of Tent City, a project combining low and middle\nincome housing with commercial use, located between Copley Square and the South End. Winslow Court is\nlocated in Roxbury. No specific information as to the percentage of black residents in these projects, or their\nincome levels have been offered.\nOf approximately $26 million in CDBG funds allocated to the City for FY 1981, HUD withheld $13 million of these\nfunds, conditioning their release on the City's performance of certain actions, including the City Council's\nenactment of a fair housing ordinance and a home rule petition, or some equivalent enforcement activities; a\nminority needs assessment; and the design of activities to address minority housing needs and to set standards\n\nto assess minority housing benefits. In 1983, HUD determined that the City had fulfilled these conditions, and\nreleased the funds. Currently all but $33,000 of these monies has been spent or obligated by the City.\nHUD has imposed no new conditions or assurances in connection with provision of CDBG or UDAG funds since\nthe lifting of the CDBG conditions in 1983. It represents that it has recently monitored Boston's performance in\n365 the CDBG program *365 with respect to furthering fair housing and has found its performance to be acceptable. It\nfurther states that it has no evidence that the City has failed to comply with any legal requirements of either\nprogram with respect to fair housing since removal of those conditions and represents that it has no current\nintention to impose any conditions, assurances or other sanctions upon the City in connection with its receipt or\nexpenditure of CDBG and UDAG funds.\nAs evidence of the City's commitment to fair housing, HUD cites its use of CDBG monies to fund the Fair\nHousing Commission, which was created in compliance with the 1981 conditions. The purpose of the commission\nis \"to increase housing opportunities for minorities and female-headed [sic] households, and to reduce housing\ndiscrimination.\" However, HUD does not point to any evidence that these laudable goals have actually been\nfurthered by the commission's activities, but contends that it has met its obligations to ensure enforcement of fair\nhousing goals by \"formally mandating the strengthening of the City's enforcement efforts as a condition to\nBoston's receipt of federal block funds.\" The plaintiffs maintain that the Commission lacks effective enforcement\ncapability, since no legislation has been passed to give it the necessary jurisdiction and enforcement power and\nthe commission operates on the basis of complaints only.\nThompson also reports statistics related to minority participation in various home improvement programs. No\nevidence has been submitted that the identified programs affect patterns of segregation, and they appear to be\ndesigned to provide assistance to individuals where they are currently located.\nWith the exceptions noted above, I shall assume that the conditions described in my previous findings of fact still\nobtain.\nLiability\nIn my prior opinions, I found that HUD had failed to satisfy the minimum levels of compliance required by § 3608\n(e)(5) in two respects. First, the agency did not require the City to establish an effective fair housing enforcement\nprogram in the face of its knowledge of pervasive racial discrimination in the City. Second, despite its knowledge\nthat a housing emergency existed which had a disproportionate impact on low income black families, HUD did\nnot condition its provision of federal funds, specifically UDAG funds on construction of affordable integrated\npublic housing. 624 F.Supp. at 1085.\nHUD has presented no new evidence which would warrant modification of my conclusion that it violated the\nminimal obligations imposed by its governing statute, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).\nAs grounds for disputing liability, HUD contends that in its order remanding this action, the court of appeals\ncommands me to adopt a narrower view of HUD's obligations and that under this lesser standard it must be\nfound not liable. I find no support for HUD's position in the text of the court's opinion. HUD's argument that the\ncourt of appeals adopted a narrow test of liability, amounting to a \"duty to consider\" appears to be based on the\ncourt's discussion of Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530 (11th Cir.1984), a case on which the\ndefendant relied in its argument for a narrow view of its liability. The court rejected this argument and held that\nthe standard set forth in that case, \"even if overly narrow, still does not support the government's view of HUD's\nduties.\" 817 F.2d at 156.\nRemedies\nPursuant to my order at the December, 1988 status conference, the plaintiff submitted a proposed final decree\nsetting forth the declaratory and injunctive relief it seeks. HUD has filed no counterproposal, contenting itself with\nchallenging the legitimacy and efficacy of any suggested remedy for the wrongs alleged.\n\nIn the absence of stipulations or compromise on remedy, I must rely on the findings and conclusions embodied in\nmy prior decisions and the meager supplementation of the record filed by the parties in connection with this\nmotion.\n366 *366 \"Of course, the court faces the difficult task of avoiding both remedies that may be too intrusive, interfering\nwith HUD's ability to carry out its basic grant-awarding mission, and those that may prove to be ineffective. This\ndifficulty is not, however, unsolvable.\" NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 159. In its order of remand, the court of\n[1]\nappeals described my remedial powers under these circumstances with celestial generality.  I am empowered\nto review and remedy patterns of inaction under both sections 706(1) and 706(2)(A) of the APA. In the absence of\nany positive response from HUD, any meaningful dialogue between the parties or any guidance from the court of\nappeals, I must make an independent judgment as to which, if any, of the plaintiff's proposals will effectuate the\npurposes of the Act.\n1. Declaratory Relief\nThe bulk of the declaratory relief requested tracks my 1983 findings of fact, specifically that HUD failed to comply\nwith the minimal requirements of § 3608(e)(5) by failing to (1) promulgate regulations and guidelines setting forth\nstandards for HUD's administration and the recipients' use of funds; (2) secure a minority needs assessment in a\ntimely manner; (3) finance the increase of desegregated housing stock to give minority families meaningful\nchoice of location, and (4) require effective fair housing enforcement by the City. These declarations are\nsupported by my previous findings.\nIn addition the plaintiff seeks a declaration that metropolitan area relief is necessary, thus laying the groundwork\nfor its proposal that HUD be obliged to assist urban black households to obtain access to publicly assisted\nhousing in the City's suburbs. The support for this request is my 1983 finding that members of the plaintiff's\nconstituency desire to relocate to the suburbs, in part due to the lack of safe housing in white urban areas, and\nthat HUD has attempted to assist them in doing so. I did not make findings which would warrant a conclusion that\nHUD failed to carry out its obligations in connection with housing assistance beyond the City limits. At this point,\nhowever, the task is to delineate a broad remedial plan to redress the whole range of the defendant's default,\nwhich includes the failure to encourage the creation of desegregated housing to correct the deficiency in the\nCity's housing stock. Measures designed to supplement that stock with affordable desegregated housing in the\nsuburbs appear to me to be appropriate under these circumstances.\nAccordingly a declaratory judgment shall enter as requested by the plaintiff.\n2. Injunctive Relief in General\nHUD argues for stringent limitations on the remedy I may devise, and raises a number of general and specific\nobjections to the injunctive relief the plaintiff requests. HUD argues generally that the requested relief is beyond\nthe relief authorized by the APA for three reasons.\nFirst, it argues the funds at issue when this case was brought have already been disbursed, and therefore its\nallegedly improper acts or omissions are no longer redressable as a practical matter. To similar effect is HUD's\nposition that changed circumstances generally have mooted the need for judicial relief, pointing to recent use of\nits grants and leveraging power to generate affordable open housing and its belief that the City is currently in\ncompliance with its obligations.\nEvidence submitted by HUD as to the City's recent use of its CDBG funds demonstrates that there have been\nattempts to address the needs of minority and lower-income individuals for affordable new and rehabilitated\nhousing. However, there is no evidence as to the adequacy of these efforts to remedy the overall lack of an\nadequate supply of affordable integrated housing in Boston.\nThe fact that this litigation has been pending for over a decade is no reason to deny the plaintiff relief, particularly\n367 in the absence of any showing that conditions have substantially improved. Despite my *367 invitation, the\n\ndefendant has not presented sufficient evidence to assure me that the conditions which gave rise to the suit have\nbeen adequately ameliorated, or that the proposed relief is unnecessary. On the contrary, the plaintiff maintains\nthat there is still no meaningful enforcement mechanism in place because of the lack of enabling legislation which\nwould give enforcement power to the Boston Fair Housing Commission.\nMoreover, this case is distinguishable from the cases on which defendant relies because the conditions\nexacerbated by HUD's pattern of inaction apparently continue to exist and are currently remediable. This is not a\ncase involving a single improper funding decision, for which there is no longer a viable remedy. See, e.g., South\nEast Lake View Neighbors v. HUD, 685 F.2d 1027 (7th Cir.1982), holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to\nenjoin federal funding when the project at issue was nearly completed, since the relief the plaintiffs requested\nwould be valueless at that stage of the proceedings.\nIn addition, the fact that the 1977-81 funds have been disbursed does not deprive HUD of all leverage over its\ngrantees. Its control of current and future grant funds gives the agency leverage to remedy past and current\nnoncompliance with fair housing goals. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 5304, 5311; Davis v. HUD, 627 F.2d 942, 945 (9th\nCir.1980), in which the court held that an action challenging HUD approval of a block grant was not mooted by\nthe fact that the grantee had already received and expended the funds, since the grantee could be obliged to\nsatisfy goals not met in the past in order to qualify for additional block grants; see also, Clients' Council v. Pierce,\n711 F.2d 1406 (8th Cir.1983), in which a remedy directing HUD to issue orders to the local housing authority to\ndesegregate its housing projects was not barred by the fact that the authority was not a party to the action, since\nthe court had \"no reason to believe that the [local authority] would refuse to comply with a specific directive\nissued by HUD at the direction of the district court.\" Clients' Council, supra, 711 F.2d at 1426.\nSecond, HUD argues that I am barred from fashioning a remedy which compels the agency to perform any act it\nis not independently obliged to perform under the FHA or its own regulations. HUD confuses the issue of liability\nwith that of an appropriate remedy once liability is fixed. HUD's specific obligations under its governing statute\nand regulations are relevant to the question of liability. But once liability has been found, I am not limited in\nfashioning a remedy to ordering HUD to perform acts which would be required of it even absent a finding of past\nculpability. This is implicit in the concept of remedial action.\nThird, HUD reinvokes its narrow construction of the order of remand, to argue that any relief must be narrowly\ntailored to impose a \"duty to consider,\" since this is its \"only conceivably `plausible' violation.\" As I have already\nmade clear, I do not agree with HUD that the order of remand fixes such a constricted view of its statutory\nobligations or of the range of available remedies.\nIn creating appropriate remedies, however, prudence requires the acknowledgement of certain political\nimperatives. The appropriation of funds for urban development is committed to Congress, and the allocation of\nsuch funds among the various sections of the country is committed to the discretion of the defendant. Imposition\nof restrictions that make Boston an unattractive candidate for federal funding may ultimately defeat the laudable\npurposes which the plaintiff seeks to achieve.\n3. Specific Remedial Measures\n(a) Funding of Additional Projects\nPlaintiff seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide new funding for the construction of affordable\ndesegregated housing and the increase of available rent subsidies, all to be allocated according to specifications\nto be supplied by the plaintiff. HUD argues that any decree which would require HUD to fund particular housing\nprojects and supply rental subsidies are foreclosed by sovereign immunity, based on the distinction drawn\n368 between *368 \"money damages\" and \"specific relief\" set out in Bowen v. Massachusetts, ___ U.S. ___, 108 S.Ct.\n2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988). The APA does not ordinarily empower a court to order an agency to fund\nparticular projects or to reach particular results. See, e.g., NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 160; United States\nv. Yonkers Board of Education, 594 F.Supp. 466 (S.D. N.Y.1984), contrasting suits to enjoin funding, which are\nauthorized by the APA, with those to provide funding, which are not.\n\nAs I have pointed out, the appropriation of funds is exclusively a matter for the Congress and the allocation of\nfunds among the various sections of the country is committed to the discretion of the Secretary. N.A.A.C.P.,\nBoston Chapter v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514 (1st Cir.1979). I find that the portions of the proposed decree which seek\nto order HUD to provide funding are barred by sovereign immunity, and are inconsistent with the statutory\nscheme for the implementation of the UDAG and CBDG programs. Accordingly I am obliged to reject this\nsuggested remedy.\n(b) Metropolitan Area Relief\nThe plaintiff seeks injunctive relief compelling HUD to require private landlords of HUD-assisted housing\nthroughout the metropolitan area to participate in an affirmative marketing program targeting low income\nminorities now living in Boston. Such a program would be administered under the auspices of the Boston Fair\nHousing Commission. In my opinion this form of remedy is warranted because of (a) HUD's failure to encourage\nthe construction of integrated housing within the City and (b) because there is a lack of safe housing for persons\nof color in the white areas of the City. The remedy sought is in my opinion a reasonable response to the\nconditions which I found to exist, even though I made no specific findings concerning suburban housing\nopportunities.\nThe requested order would not require the defendant to impose conditions on local authorities over which it has\nno control, cf. Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 758 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir.1985), nor to restructure\nunits of local government, cf. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). In my\nopinion, an order requiring the defendant to condition the federal funding of private suburban housing projects is\nlegal, feasible and an appropriate remedy for the defendant's default. Hills v. Gatreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 305-6, 96\nS.Ct. 1538, 1550, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976).\n(c) Fair Housing Conditions\nThe plaintiff seeks an order that HUD impose a series of Fair Housing Conditions on the City and\nCommonwealth, under any grant programs wherein it has power to impose conditions on grantees. These\nconditions include promulgation of legislation eliminating the current exemption of five or fewer unit housing from\nthe reach of The Fair Housing Ordinance, and granting the Fair Housing Commission enforcement powers; the\nparticipation of all managers and owners of state or City assisted housing in the metropolitan area in rental\nassistance and affirmative marketing programs; and the implementation of an enforcement program.\nHUD argues that the plaintiff lacks standing to seek relief from these entities, because they are not defendants in\nthis action. This argument fails for the same reason as HUD's previous standing argument, i.e., the relief sought\nis obtainable from HUD, which is a party to this action. At least insofar as the conditions requested promote\nintegrated fair housing, they are permissible.\nHUD further argues that it cannot legally condition its grants to the Commonwealth and the City, because the Act\nand applicable regulations require as a prerequisite to conditioning that the grantee be found to have failed to\ncomply with its duties.\nSection 5304(d) gives the Secretary the power to deal with a grantee's current and future performance. This\nprovision requires the Secretary, on at least an annual basis, to make reviews and audits of a grantee's activities,\n369 and permits him to *369 make to \"make appropriate adjustments in the amount of the annual grants\" in\naccordance with his findings. 42 U.S.C. § 5304(d). Section 5311 addresses past noncompliance, and requires\nthe Secretary to impose conditions if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, he finds that the grantee \"has failed\nto comply substantially with any provision of this chapter ...\". 42 U.S.C. § 5311(a). Use of this latter provision is\nmandated for cases of past noncompliance which do not affect current or future performance, but it is sparingly\ninvoked because of the procedural safeguards for the grantee attendant to its exercise. See, e.g., Kansas v.\nHUD, 861 F.2d 739, 742-44 (D.C.Cir.1988).\n\nThe process HUD points to is not required under section 5304, which deals with current noncompliance. Since\nthe plaintiff claims that the failure to pass enabling legislation endowing the Boston Fair Housing Commission\nwith jurisdiction and enforcement powers constitutes current nonperformance of its fair housing obligations,\nsection 5304 may be invoked rather than section 5311.\nThe City's 1981 CDBG application was premised on the implementation of a fair housing plan, which included\nprovision for meaningful enforcement of minority access to housing opportunities. While a fair housing ordinance\nhas been passed, and a fair housing commission created, enabling legislation has never been passed which\ngives the commission enforcement power. These measures appear to be ineffective to fulfill the City's\nundertaking, and it is unclear why HUD deemed them sufficient to demonstrate compliance. Accordingly, there\nalso seems to be valid grounds for invoking the agency's conditioning power under section 5311, since it does\nnot appear that the City ever was in genuine compliance with these conditions.\nHUD admits, moreover, that the conditions and assurances it imposed beginning in 1977, were imposed without\nany findings that the City discriminated in its HUD funded programs. Given this representation, and the fact that\nthe conditions included the passage of legislation, I find the defendant's procedural and federalism arguments\nagainst \"hold[ing] the City and State's block grant `hostage' until they enact desired legislation\" unconvincing.\nIn addition, HUD contends that such a condition would be impermissible since it is obliged to award UDAG funds\non the basis of a national competition utilizing uniform selection criteria, under 42 U.S.C. § 5318(d)(1), and that it\nis expressly barred from discriminating in such allocation of funds based on the type of activity involved, under 42\nU.S.C. § 5318(r). In my opinion that provision has absolutely nothing to do with HUD's obligation to promote the\nfair housing goals expressly declared in the Act.\nAn order shall enter substantially in accordance with the plaintiff's request.\n(d) Promulgation of Regulations\nThe plaintiff seeks an order that HUD promulgate regulations and guidelines which set forth standards for HUD's\nadministration and recipients' use of funds under HUD's housing and community development programs and\nactivities in accordance with Title VIII. Such an order is designed to facilitate meaningful compliance with and\nenforcement of fair housing goals. The request tracks my 1983 finding, which the plaintiff seeks to embody in the\ndeclaratory portion of the decree, that HUD failed to promulgate standards of performance or regulations under\nTitle VIII.\nIn addition to challenging the propriety of this demand, HUD represents that such rules and handbooks are\nalready in existence, citing as examples, Handbook No. 800.3: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Monitoring of\nCommunity Development Programs; 24 C.F.R. §§ 570.900, et seq. In addition, HUD points to recent statutory\nand regulatory amendments which impose more stringent standards on recipients of Fair Housing Assistance\nProgram Funds. The plaintiff concedes that new regulations have been proposed, but argues that they are\n370 inadequate in that they relate solely to the processing of private individual claims of discrimination, *370 and give\nno guidance to HUD or grantee administrators.\nThe court of appeals expressly noted that my remedial power under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), includes the\npower to compel the Secretary to promulgate regulations to carry out the intent of Congress, where he has failed\nto exercise his discretion to do so. NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 160. Nevertheless, I am very reluctant to\nadd to the existing mountain of federal rules and regulations. I am only concerned with the specific local problems\nraised in this case. In my opinion the proper articulation of the conditions described above in each grant of HUD\nfunds will be sufficient to the occasion.\nORDER\nA declaratory judgment and final decree shall enter forthwith in accordance with the foregoing.\n\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND FINAL DECREE\nAfter a trial in this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and after consideration of the parties' submissions\nwith respect to remedies and in accordance with the memorandum filed herewith:\nI. Declaratory Relief\nIt is Declared that:\nA. During the period 1977 to 1982, in administering its programs and activities relating to housing and urban\ndevelopment in the City of Boston (\"the City\"), HUD did not satisfy minimum levels of compliance with Title VIII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5), as amended, to administer its programs and activities in a\nmanner affirmatively to further the policies of fair housing by:\n1. Failing to promulgate regulations or guidelines which adequately set forth standards for HUD's\nadministration and recipients' use of funds under HUD programs;\n2. Failing to secure a minority needs assessment from the City in a timely manner;\n3. Failing adequately to condition and monitor use of its funding by grantees and recipients, so as\nto assure the use of these monies to produce an adequate supply of affordable integrated family\nhousing; and\n4. Failing to require effective fair housing enforcement by the City.\nB. In light of HUD's failure to comply with its statutory mandate, and the resultant lack of affordable desegregated\nhousing, Metropolitan Area relief is appropriate under these circumstances, and to the extent provided in this\nDecree.\nII. Remedial Order\nIt is Ordered that:\nA. Metropolitan Area Relief\nHUD shall require the owners and managers of any assisted public or private housing within any city or town\nwithin the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area, including Boston (\"the Metropolitan Area\"), to participate fully in\navailable programs designed to facilitate access to suburban housing opportunities for low-income minority\nhouseholds now living in the City. These programs shall include, without limitation, the listing requirements and\naffirmative marketing programs created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this Decree.\nThe requirements of this Decree shall apply with equal force to all assisted housing in the Metropolitan Area.\n\"Assisted Housing\" means housing the cost of whose purchase, development, operation or rehabilitation is\nsubsidized in whole or in part with public funds or other resources, whether such funds or resources derive from\nfederal, state or local government.\nIn enforcing this Decree, HUD shall use any power it possesses to impose conditions on grantees, recipients, or\nbeneficiaries, pursuant to any grant or any other program.\n\nB. Fair Housing Conditions Upon Funding to the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts.\n371 Following entry of this Decree, HUD shall include in any approval of an application *371 for funding by the\nCommonwealth, under any grant or other program administered by HUD pursuant to which it has the power to\nimpose conditions upon grantees or recipients, the following conditions:\n1. That the Commonwealth require owners and operators of any state-assisted public or private housing available\nfor rental or sale in the Metropolitan Area to participate fully in programs designed to enhance access to low-\nincome housing by Black households, including but not limited to, Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing and\naffirmative marketing programs created pursuant to Sections II.C.3 of this Decree.\n2. That the Commonwealth promulgate legislation granting the Boston Fair Housing Commission (\"the\nCommission\") effective enforcement powers, including but not limited to, the power to issue subpoenas, levy\nfines and institute civil actions;\n3. That the Commonwealth prepare and provide such reports and statements regarding assisted housing in the\nMetropolitan Area as are required from time to time by HUD. Such submissions shall include, without limitation,\nreports on the racial and family composition of state-assisted housing, and a statement of the projected use of\nfunds and community development plan, as required by 42 U.S.C. § 5304.\nC. Fair Housing Conditions Upon Funding to the City\nFollowing entry of this Decree, HUD shall include in any approval of an application for funding by the City, under\nany grant or other program administered by HUD pursuant to which it has the power to impose conditions upon\ngrantees or recipients, the following conditions:\n1. That the City require the owners and operators of any City-assisted public or private housing available for\nrental or sale to participate fully in programs designed to enhance access to low-income housing by low-income\nBlack households, including but not limited to Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing and affirmative marketing\nprograms created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this Decree.\n2. That the City promulgate an amendment to its Fair Housing Ordinance eliminating the exemption of housing\nconsisting of five or fewer units;\n3. That within 60 days after HUD's approval of the application, the City design and submit to HUD and the plaintiff\nand, upon HUD's approval, implement a Fair Housing Program, to be administered by the Commission, including,\nwithout limitation, the following components:\na. A Boston Housing Opportunity Clearing Center, in which shall be listed all assisted public or\nprivate housing units available for sale or rental in the Metropolitan Area, which are required to be\nlisted by this Decree or any other authority, or any private units which are offered for listing by their\nowners or operators;\nb. A Fair Housing Law Enforcement Program, designed to identify and alleviate racially\ndiscriminatory practices in the sale and rental of housing in the City, which shall, without limitation:\n(i) Hear and investigate complaints of discriminatory practices;\n(ii) Bring administrative and judicial proceedings against persons engaging in discriminatory\npractices;\n(iii) Assist victims of discrimination by providing information as to rights and available remedies,\nand referrals to legal services organizations and private attorneys available to assist in\ndiscrimination claims.\n\nc. An Affirmative Marketing Program pursuant to 24 C.F.R. 200.620, which requires the owners\nand operators of assisted housing in the City to pursue affirmative fair housing marketing policies\nin soliciting buyers and tenants, in determining their eligibility, and in concluding sales and rental\ntransactions.\nThe Plan shall be designed to enhance the availability to persons of color of housing in\nneighborhoods which are now predominantly white. The goal of the Plan and its measure of\nsuccess shall be to achieve a racial composition in assisted housing, in neighborhoods which are\n372 predominantly *372 white, which reflects the racial composition of the City as a whole.\nd. A Fair Housing Public Education Program designed to make use of various public forums, such\nas broadcast media, bill boards, and community and social service organizations, to inform the\npublic of rights and available remedies under applicable fair housing and anti-discrimination laws\nand regulations, including but not limited to, the existence and functions of the Commission, the\nClearing Center, and of the other components of the Fair Housing Program;\n4. That the City prepare and submit to HUD such reports and statements regarding assisted housing as are\nrequired from time to time by HUD. Such submissions shall include, without limitation, a report on the racial and\nfamily composition of assisted housing, and a plan for the projected use of funds for community development, as\nrequired by 42 U.S.C. § 5304.\nD. Stock of Affordable Housing\n1. HUD shall use its best efforts and available resources to increase the supply of affordable integrated family\nhousing in the City, whether public, public-assisted, or private.\n2. HUD shall not agree to any disposition of HUD-assisted housing which has the effect of reducing the supply of\naffordable family housing in the City available as of the effective date of this Decree.\nIII. Monitoring and Reports\nCommencing three months after the effective date of this Decree and every six months thereafter, HUD shall\nsubmit to the court and serve upon the plaintiff:\nA. A report prepared by HUD or its grantees setting forth the current racial makeup, family composition and\nvacancy rate of HUD assisted housing projects or units in the City;\nB. A report describing the activities carried out and the results achieved in implementing this Decree.\nIV. Retention of Jurisdiction\nA. Jurisdiction is retained by the court for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff and HUD to apply to the court at\nany time for such further orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction, implementation,\nmodification or enforcement of this Decree.\nB. At any time after the fifth anniversary of the effective date, either HUD or the plaintiff may request the court to\nreview the progress made in implementing this Decree, and, based upon such review, to modify or terminate any\nand all rights or obligations provided therein.\nC. If HUD is unable to comply with its obligations under this Decree, for lack of authorization or any other reason,\nthe plaintiff may move for such comparable alternative relief as is appropriate.\n\nCLARIFICATION AND AMENDMENT OF JUDGMENT\nOn June 23, 1989, I issued a Declaratory Judgment and Final Decree (\"the Decree\"), setting forth the relief to be\naccorded the plaintiff N.A.A.C.P. The federal defendants move to amend the judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.\n59(e), in order to clarify HUD's obligations under the Decree and to modify certain aspects of the Decree which\nmight defeat its objectives. In general, the decree intentionally broadens the obligations of the defendants. It is a\nremedial decree as opposed to an order enforcing existing obligations.\n1. Inclusion of Section 8 Housing in Metropolitan Area Relief\nThe omission of a specific reference to the Section 8 rental subsidy program in section II.A of the Decree, dealing\nwith Metropolitan Area Relief, does not indicate an intent to exclude the program from this portion of the Decree.\nSection II.A, ¶ 1 sentence 2 is amended to read:\n\"These programs shall include, without limitation, Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing\n373 requirements and affirmative *373 marketing programs created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this\nDecree.\"\n2. The Meaning of \"Assisted Housing\"\nHUD seeks clarification of the terms \"Assisted Housing\" and \"HUD-Assisted Housing.\" I hereby modify the\ndecree to expressly include within the definition of these terms (1) housing assisted by government insurance of\nprivate mortgage loans, and (2) housing created or developed under CDBG programs.\n3. \"Power to Condition\" Absolute or Conditional\nHUD questions whether the phrase \"power to condition\" in section II of the Decree leaves it the discretion to\nrefrain from conditioning programs with respect to which it has not made the factual findings normally prerequisite\nto the exercise of conditioning power.\nThe direction that HUD \"use any power it possesses to impose conditions\" applies with respect to any HUD\nprograms within the geographical reach of the Decree whose governing statutes and regulations include\nconditioning power. I expressly rule that HUD's obligation to impose the conditions set forth in the Decree is not\nlimited to circumstances in which it has made the factual findings normally prerequisite to the exercise of that\npower, and that it does not have the discretion to refrain from imposing the specified conditions.\n4. The Meaning of \"Available Resources\"\nThe term \"Available Resources\" refers to funds and other resources available to HUD at a Regional level, not\nnationwide.\nMy order that HUD \"use its best efforts and available resources\" to increase the supply of affordable integrated\nhousing, in section II.D of the Decree, does not direct the agency to make additional funding available or\notherwise to channel resources to the Boston Metropolitan Area beyond what the region would otherwise receive,\nbut only to maximize the extent to which available funds are used to provide such housing.\n5. Meaning of \"Affordable Housing\"\nSection II.D of the Decree obliges HUD to promote the supply of \"affordable integrated family housing\" in Boston.\nHUD requests modification of the Decree to define the term \"affordable,\" to facilitate its calculation of the size of\n\nthe current housing stock. HUD suggests a definition with respect to rental housing, but has no specific definition\nto proffer in the context of home ownership.\nI hereby modify the Decree to include the following, as section II.D.3:\na. \"Affordable housing\" means housing whose effective cost to a very low, low or moderate\nincome household does not exceed 30% of such household's combined net income.\nb. \"Very low-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not more than\n50% of the median income for the City of Boston.\nc. \"Low-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not less than 50%\nand not more than 80% of the median income for the City of Boston.\nd. \"Moderate-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not less than\n80% and not more than 95% of the median income for the City of Boston.\n6. References to \"Persons of Color\" and \"Blacks\"\nThe reference to \"persons of color\" is intentional, and will stand.\n7. Exemptions of Fair Housing Programs\nThe following HUD programs or actions are exempt from the Decree's conditioning requirements, since as\npresently constituted these programs support the remedial goals embodied in the Decree.\na. The approval of funds by HUD under the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP);\n374 *374 b. The execution of contracts between HUD's Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Office\n(FHEO) and a city or state agency, to perform fair housing investigations for HUD.\n[1] \"The decision of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\" 817 F.2d at 161.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

No. 78-850-S.\nUnited States District Court, D. Massachusetts.\nJune 23, 1989.\nClarification and Amendment of Judgment September 14, 1989.\n336623 *362*363 Natasha Lisman, Sugarman, Rogers, Barshak & Cohen, Boston, Mass., for plaintiff.\nChristine Roach, Asst. U.S. Atty., Boston, Mass., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER FOR JUDGMENT\nSKINNER, District Judge.\nThe plaintiff N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter (\"NAACP\") seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, on the grounds that\nthe Secretary and other officials of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(collectively \"HUD\") have failed to administer certain programs in the City of Boston \"in a manner affirmatively to\nfurther the policies of [the Federal Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968]\" (\"the Act\"), in\nviolation of HUD's obligations under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).\nBackground\nThe NAACP filed this action in April of 1978, both on its own account and as representative of blacks in\nMetropolitan Boston alleging that HUD had failed to carry out its statutory mandate to promote fair housing in\nconnection with its administration of housing and community development programs in the City of Boston (\"the\nCity\"). The plaintiff challenges HUD's granting of funds to the City under its Community Development Block Grant\n(\"CDBG\") and Urban Development Action Grant (\"UDAG\") programs, on the basis that its constituency has been\nand is being excluded from equal access to the benefits of the programs funded. The claim as to the CDBG funds\nis essentially that HUD has failed to impose and enforce adequate conditions in connection with its grants to the\nCity to promote fair housing goals. The complaint as to the UDAG funds has focused on HUD's failure to use its\nleverage to cause the City to increase the supply of affordable desegregated housing.\nA trial on the merits was commenced in 1982 after remand from the court of appeals reversing a judgment of\ndismissal of the UDAG claim. On April 27, 1983, I made findings of fact and rulings of law which are published at\n567 F.Supp. 637 (1983), and are restated in summary fashion at 624 F.Supp. 1083, 1084-85 (1985).\nIn those decisions I concluded that HUD did not intentionally discriminate in administering its programs, and that\nthe evidence did not warrant a finding that HUD financed City programs which were either intentionally\ndiscriminatory or had a discriminatory impact. Based on these findings and conclusions, I found that HUD had not\nviolated § 109 of Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5309, § 601 of Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, or the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\nI found that HUD was in violation of its own regulations, by continuing to furnish CDBG funds despite the City's\nfailure to submit a Community Development and Housing plan identifying the \"special needs\" of the lower income\npopulation, required under 24 C.F.R. 570.300(b) (\"the minority needs assessment\"). This omission significantly\nimpeded HUD's capacity to carry out its statutory mandate, prescribed by the Act, to promote fair housing in\n\nfederally financed projects. The City supplied a minority needs assessment on September 7, 1982, thus\npermitting HUD to continue financing its programs in compliance with its own regulations.\nThis left only the issue of HUD's compliance with its mandate under 42 U.S.C. 3608(e)(5), to \"administer the\nprograms and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the\npolicies of [the Act].\" While I found that HUD had failed its obligations in this regard, 624 F.Supp. at 1085\n(D.Mass.1985), I believed that I had no legal authority to redress such omissions under the Administrative\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551, et seq. (the \"APA\"), because HUD's compliance with this section was committed\nto the agency's discretion pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) and would require essentially managerial decisions\n364 which courts are ill-equipped to perform. *364 As this was the only remaining claim, I dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed my order dismissing the claim based on § 3608(e)(5), holding\nthat the pattern of inaction which comprised the alleged violation was not exempted from review under the APA.\nIn addition, the court discussed available remedies under the APA, and made it clear that I have broad discretion\nto tailor a remedy to the current circumstances. The court remanded the action, for consideration of appropriate\nremedies for HUD's violation of its statutory obligations, N.A.A.C.P. v. HUD, 817 F.2d 149, 160-1 (1st Cir.1987).\nI stayed the action on July 4, 1987 and ordered the parties to participate in mediation proceedings under the\nauspices of the Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice (\"CRS\"). In a status conference held\nDecember 14, 1988 the parties reported that attempts to reach a resolution through mediation had failed, despite\nthe heroic efforts of the mediators.\nIn accordance with the court of appeals' directive, I solicited submissions from the parties as to any\ndevelopments in the housing situation in the City since the 1982 trial, and for suggestions as to an appropriate\nremedy. To this end, I directed the plaintiff to submit a motion for entry of judgment, together with a proposed\ndecree.\nThe plaintiff has submitted such a motion, together with a proposed order setting forth the declaratory and\ninjunctive relief it currently seeks. HUD has not submitted a counterproposal but opposes the plaintiff's motion on\nthe grounds that it is not liable for any violation and that the relief requested is both beyond my power to award\nand inappropriate to the facts of this case.\nCurrent Conditions\nIn addition to failing to produce any agreement on remedy, the mediation proceedings were barren of useful\ninformation as well, in that no stipulations, factual findings by the mediator or any record derived from those\nproceedings has been made available to the court. The parties have been unable to reach any stipulations\nthemselves as to the current situation. While the plaintiff has offered to submit testimony of an expert who would\ntestify that barriers to open housing have not diminished since 1983, and that HUD has not played an active role\nin addressing those barriers, the sole evidentiary supplementation to the record before me is the affidavit of\nHarold Thompson, HUD's Deputy Regional Administrator in Boston, which is offered to report on HUD's\nconditioning and monitoring activities in the seven years since the trial.\nIn December of 1985, two of the housing projects for which the plaintiff sought approval, Winslow Court and\nHarbor (Columbia) Point, received financing through the interaction of HUD, the City and agencies of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition, the City has committed $31,000,000 of its anticipated $31,300,000\nrepayment from the Copley Place UDAG to the construction of Tent City, a project combining low and middle\nincome housing with commercial use, located between Copley Square and the South End. Winslow Court is\nlocated in Roxbury. No specific information as to the percentage of black residents in these projects, or their\nincome levels have been offered.\nOf approximately $26 million in CDBG funds allocated to the City for FY 1981, HUD withheld $13 million of these\nfunds, conditioning their release on the City's performance of certain actions, including the City Council's\nenactment of a fair housing ordinance and a home rule petition, or some equivalent enforcement activities; a\nminority needs assessment; and the design of activities to address minority housing needs and to set standards\n\nto assess minority housing benefits. In 1983, HUD determined that the City had fulfilled these conditions, and\nreleased the funds. Currently all but $33,000 of these monies has been spent or obligated by the City.\nHUD has imposed no new conditions or assurances in connection with provision of CDBG or UDAG funds since\nthe lifting of the CDBG conditions in 1983. It represents that it has recently monitored Boston's performance in\n365 the CDBG program *365 with respect to furthering fair housing and has found its performance to be acceptable. It\nfurther states that it has no evidence that the City has failed to comply with any legal requirements of either\nprogram with respect to fair housing since removal of those conditions and represents that it has no current\nintention to impose any conditions, assurances or other sanctions upon the City in connection with its receipt or\nexpenditure of CDBG and UDAG funds.\nAs evidence of the City's commitment to fair housing, HUD cites its use of CDBG monies to fund the Fair\nHousing Commission, which was created in compliance with the 1981 conditions. The purpose of the commission\nis \"to increase housing opportunities for minorities and female-headed [sic] households, and to reduce housing\ndiscrimination.\" However, HUD does not point to any evidence that these laudable goals have actually been\nfurthered by the commission's activities, but contends that it has met its obligations to ensure enforcement of fair\nhousing goals by \"formally mandating the strengthening of the City's enforcement efforts as a condition to\nBoston's receipt of federal block funds.\" The plaintiffs maintain that the Commission lacks effective enforcement\ncapability, since no legislation has been passed to give it the necessary jurisdiction and enforcement power and\nthe commission operates on the basis of complaints only.\nThompson also reports statistics related to minority participation in various home improvement programs. No\nevidence has been submitted that the identified programs affect patterns of segregation, and they appear to be\ndesigned to provide assistance to individuals where they are currently located.\nWith the exceptions noted above, I shall assume that the conditions described in my previous findings of fact still\nobtain.\nLiability\nIn my prior opinions, I found that HUD had failed to satisfy the minimum levels of compliance required by § 3608\n(e)(5) in two respects. First, the agency did not require the City to establish an effective fair housing enforcement\nprogram in the face of its knowledge of pervasive racial discrimination in the City. Second, despite its knowledge\nthat a housing emergency existed which had a disproportionate impact on low income black families, HUD did\nnot condition its provision of federal funds, specifically UDAG funds on construction of affordable integrated\npublic housing. 624 F.Supp. at 1085.\nHUD has presented no new evidence which would warrant modification of my conclusion that it violated the\nminimal obligations imposed by its governing statute, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5).\nAs grounds for disputing liability, HUD contends that in its order remanding this action, the court of appeals\ncommands me to adopt a narrower view of HUD's obligations and that under this lesser standard it must be\nfound not liable. I find no support for HUD's position in the text of the court's opinion. HUD's argument that the\ncourt of appeals adopted a narrow test of liability, amounting to a \"duty to consider\" appears to be based on the\ncourt's discussion of Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530 (11th Cir.1984), a case on which the\ndefendant relied in its argument for a narrow view of its liability. The court rejected this argument and held that\nthe standard set forth in that case, \"even if overly narrow, still does not support the government's view of HUD's\nduties.\" 817 F.2d at 156.\nRemedies\nPursuant to my order at the December, 1988 status conference, the plaintiff submitted a proposed final decree\nsetting forth the declaratory and injunctive relief it seeks. HUD has filed no counterproposal, contenting itself with\nchallenging the legitimacy and efficacy of any suggested remedy for the wrongs alleged.\n\nIn the absence of stipulations or compromise on remedy, I must rely on the findings and conclusions embodied in\nmy prior decisions and the meager supplementation of the record filed by the parties in connection with this\nmotion.\n366 *366 \"Of course, the court faces the difficult task of avoiding both remedies that may be too intrusive, interfering\nwith HUD's ability to carry out its basic grant-awarding mission, and those that may prove to be ineffective. This\ndifficulty is not, however, unsolvable.\" NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 159. In its order of remand, the court of\n[1]\nappeals described my remedial powers under these circumstances with celestial generality.  I am empowered\nto review and remedy patterns of inaction under both sections 706(1) and 706(2)(A) of the APA. In the absence of\nany positive response from HUD, any meaningful dialogue between the parties or any guidance from the court of\nappeals, I must make an independent judgment as to which, if any, of the plaintiff's proposals will effectuate the\npurposes of the Act.\n1. Declaratory Relief\nThe bulk of the declaratory relief requested tracks my 1983 findings of fact, specifically that HUD failed to comply\nwith the minimal requirements of § 3608(e)(5) by failing to (1) promulgate regulations and guidelines setting forth\nstandards for HUD's administration and the recipients' use of funds; (2) secure a minority needs assessment in a\ntimely manner; (3) finance the increase of desegregated housing stock to give minority families meaningful\nchoice of location, and (4) require effective fair housing enforcement by the City. These declarations are\nsupported by my previous findings.\nIn addition the plaintiff seeks a declaration that metropolitan area relief is necessary, thus laying the groundwork\nfor its proposal that HUD be obliged to assist urban black households to obtain access to publicly assisted\nhousing in the City's suburbs. The support for this request is my 1983 finding that members of the plaintiff's\nconstituency desire to relocate to the suburbs, in part due to the lack of safe housing in white urban areas, and\nthat HUD has attempted to assist them in doing so. I did not make findings which would warrant a conclusion that\nHUD failed to carry out its obligations in connection with housing assistance beyond the City limits. At this point,\nhowever, the task is to delineate a broad remedial plan to redress the whole range of the defendant's default,\nwhich includes the failure to encourage the creation of desegregated housing to correct the deficiency in the\nCity's housing stock. Measures designed to supplement that stock with affordable desegregated housing in the\nsuburbs appear to me to be appropriate under these circumstances.\nAccordingly a declaratory judgment shall enter as requested by the plaintiff.\n2. Injunctive Relief in General\nHUD argues for stringent limitations on the remedy I may devise, and raises a number of general and specific\nobjections to the injunctive relief the plaintiff requests. HUD argues generally that the requested relief is beyond\nthe relief authorized by the APA for three reasons.\nFirst, it argues the funds at issue when this case was brought have already been disbursed, and therefore its\nallegedly improper acts or omissions are no longer redressable as a practical matter. To similar effect is HUD's\nposition that changed circumstances generally have mooted the need for judicial relief, pointing to recent use of\nits grants and leveraging power to generate affordable open housing and its belief that the City is currently in\ncompliance with its obligations.\nEvidence submitted by HUD as to the City's recent use of its CDBG funds demonstrates that there have been\nattempts to address the needs of minority and lower-income individuals for affordable new and rehabilitated\nhousing. However, there is no evidence as to the adequacy of these efforts to remedy the overall lack of an\nadequate supply of affordable integrated housing in Boston.\nThe fact that this litigation has been pending for over a decade is no reason to deny the plaintiff relief, particularly\n367 in the absence of any showing that conditions have substantially improved. Despite my *367 invitation, the\n\ndefendant has not presented sufficient evidence to assure me that the conditions which gave rise to the suit have\nbeen adequately ameliorated, or that the proposed relief is unnecessary. On the contrary, the plaintiff maintains\nthat there is still no meaningful enforcement mechanism in place because of the lack of enabling legislation which\nwould give enforcement power to the Boston Fair Housing Commission.\nMoreover, this case is distinguishable from the cases on which defendant relies because the conditions\nexacerbated by HUD's pattern of inaction apparently continue to exist and are currently remediable. This is not a\ncase involving a single improper funding decision, for which there is no longer a viable remedy. See, e.g., South\nEast Lake View Neighbors v. HUD, 685 F.2d 1027 (7th Cir.1982), holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to\nenjoin federal funding when the project at issue was nearly completed, since the relief the plaintiffs requested\nwould be valueless at that stage of the proceedings.\nIn addition, the fact that the 1977-81 funds have been disbursed does not deprive HUD of all leverage over its\ngrantees. Its control of current and future grant funds gives the agency leverage to remedy past and current\nnoncompliance with fair housing goals. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 5304, 5311; Davis v. HUD, 627 F.2d 942, 945 (9th\nCir.1980), in which the court held that an action challenging HUD approval of a block grant was not mooted by\nthe fact that the grantee had already received and expended the funds, since the grantee could be obliged to\nsatisfy goals not met in the past in order to qualify for additional block grants; see also, Clients' Council v. Pierce,\n711 F.2d 1406 (8th Cir.1983), in which a remedy directing HUD to issue orders to the local housing authority to\ndesegregate its housing projects was not barred by the fact that the authority was not a party to the action, since\nthe court had \"no reason to believe that the [local authority] would refuse to comply with a specific directive\nissued by HUD at the direction of the district court.\" Clients' Council, supra, 711 F.2d at 1426.\nSecond, HUD argues that I am barred from fashioning a remedy which compels the agency to perform any act it\nis not independently obliged to perform under the FHA or its own regulations. HUD confuses the issue of liability\nwith that of an appropriate remedy once liability is fixed. HUD's specific obligations under its governing statute\nand regulations are relevant to the question of liability. But once liability has been found, I am not limited in\nfashioning a remedy to ordering HUD to perform acts which would be required of it even absent a finding of past\nculpability. This is implicit in the concept of remedial action.\nThird, HUD reinvokes its narrow construction of the order of remand, to argue that any relief must be narrowly\ntailored to impose a \"duty to consider,\" since this is its \"only conceivably `plausible' violation.\" As I have already\nmade clear, I do not agree with HUD that the order of remand fixes such a constricted view of its statutory\nobligations or of the range of available remedies.\nIn creating appropriate remedies, however, prudence requires the acknowledgement of certain political\nimperatives. The appropriation of funds for urban development is committed to Congress, and the allocation of\nsuch funds among the various sections of the country is committed to the discretion of the defendant. Imposition\nof restrictions that make Boston an unattractive candidate for federal funding may ultimately defeat the laudable\npurposes which the plaintiff seeks to achieve.\n3. Specific Remedial Measures\n(a) Funding of Additional Projects\nPlaintiff seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide new funding for the construction of affordable\ndesegregated housing and the increase of available rent subsidies, all to be allocated according to specifications\nto be supplied by the plaintiff. HUD argues that any decree which would require HUD to fund particular housing\nprojects and supply rental subsidies are foreclosed by sovereign immunity, based on the distinction drawn\n368 between *368 \"money damages\" and \"specific relief\" set out in Bowen v. Massachusetts, ___ U.S. ___, 108 S.Ct.\n2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988). The APA does not ordinarily empower a court to order an agency to fund\nparticular projects or to reach particular results. See, e.g., NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 160; United States\nv. Yonkers Board of Education, 594 F.Supp. 466 (S.D. N.Y.1984), contrasting suits to enjoin funding, which are\nauthorized by the APA, with those to provide funding, which are not.\n\nAs I have pointed out, the appropriation of funds is exclusively a matter for the Congress and the allocation of\nfunds among the various sections of the country is committed to the discretion of the Secretary. N.A.A.C.P.,\nBoston Chapter v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514 (1st Cir.1979). I find that the portions of the proposed decree which seek\nto order HUD to provide funding are barred by sovereign immunity, and are inconsistent with the statutory\nscheme for the implementation of the UDAG and CBDG programs. Accordingly I am obliged to reject this\nsuggested remedy.\n(b) Metropolitan Area Relief\nThe plaintiff seeks injunctive relief compelling HUD to require private landlords of HUD-assisted housing\nthroughout the metropolitan area to participate in an affirmative marketing program targeting low income\nminorities now living in Boston. Such a program would be administered under the auspices of the Boston Fair\nHousing Commission. In my opinion this form of remedy is warranted because of (a) HUD's failure to encourage\nthe construction of integrated housing within the City and (b) because there is a lack of safe housing for persons\nof color in the white areas of the City. The remedy sought is in my opinion a reasonable response to the\nconditions which I found to exist, even though I made no specific findings concerning suburban housing\nopportunities.\nThe requested order would not require the defendant to impose conditions on local authorities over which it has\nno control, cf. Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 758 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir.1985), nor to restructure\nunits of local government, cf. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). In my\nopinion, an order requiring the defendant to condition the federal funding of private suburban housing projects is\nlegal, feasible and an appropriate remedy for the defendant's default. Hills v. Gatreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 305-6, 96\nS.Ct. 1538, 1550, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976).\n(c) Fair Housing Conditions\nThe plaintiff seeks an order that HUD impose a series of Fair Housing Conditions on the City and\nCommonwealth, under any grant programs wherein it has power to impose conditions on grantees. These\nconditions include promulgation of legislation eliminating the current exemption of five or fewer unit housing from\nthe reach of The Fair Housing Ordinance, and granting the Fair Housing Commission enforcement powers; the\nparticipation of all managers and owners of state or City assisted housing in the metropolitan area in rental\nassistance and affirmative marketing programs; and the implementation of an enforcement program.\nHUD argues that the plaintiff lacks standing to seek relief from these entities, because they are not defendants in\nthis action. This argument fails for the same reason as HUD's previous standing argument, i.e., the relief sought\nis obtainable from HUD, which is a party to this action. At least insofar as the conditions requested promote\nintegrated fair housing, they are permissible.\nHUD further argues that it cannot legally condition its grants to the Commonwealth and the City, because the Act\nand applicable regulations require as a prerequisite to conditioning that the grantee be found to have failed to\ncomply with its duties.\nSection 5304(d) gives the Secretary the power to deal with a grantee's current and future performance. This\nprovision requires the Secretary, on at least an annual basis, to make reviews and audits of a grantee's activities,\n369 and permits him to *369 make to \"make appropriate adjustments in the amount of the annual grants\" in\naccordance with his findings. 42 U.S.C. § 5304(d). Section 5311 addresses past noncompliance, and requires\nthe Secretary to impose conditions if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, he finds that the grantee \"has failed\nto comply substantially with any provision of this chapter ...\". 42 U.S.C. § 5311(a). Use of this latter provision is\nmandated for cases of past noncompliance which do not affect current or future performance, but it is sparingly\ninvoked because of the procedural safeguards for the grantee attendant to its exercise. See, e.g., Kansas v.\nHUD, 861 F.2d 739, 742-44 (D.C.Cir.1988).\n\nThe process HUD points to is not required under section 5304, which deals with current noncompliance. Since\nthe plaintiff claims that the failure to pass enabling legislation endowing the Boston Fair Housing Commission\nwith jurisdiction and enforcement powers constitutes current nonperformance of its fair housing obligations,\nsection 5304 may be invoked rather than section 5311.\nThe City's 1981 CDBG application was premised on the implementation of a fair housing plan, which included\nprovision for meaningful enforcement of minority access to housing opportunities. While a fair housing ordinance\nhas been passed, and a fair housing commission created, enabling legislation has never been passed which\ngives the commission enforcement power. These measures appear to be ineffective to fulfill the City's\nundertaking, and it is unclear why HUD deemed them sufficient to demonstrate compliance. Accordingly, there\nalso seems to be valid grounds for invoking the agency's conditioning power under section 5311, since it does\nnot appear that the City ever was in genuine compliance with these conditions.\nHUD admits, moreover, that the conditions and assurances it imposed beginning in 1977, were imposed without\nany findings that the City discriminated in its HUD funded programs. Given this representation, and the fact that\nthe conditions included the passage of legislation, I find the defendant's procedural and federalism arguments\nagainst \"hold[ing] the City and State's block grant `hostage' until they enact desired legislation\" unconvincing.\nIn addition, HUD contends that such a condition would be impermissible since it is obliged to award UDAG funds\non the basis of a national competition utilizing uniform selection criteria, under 42 U.S.C. § 5318(d)(1), and that it\nis expressly barred from discriminating in such allocation of funds based on the type of activity involved, under 42\nU.S.C. § 5318(r). In my opinion that provision has absolutely nothing to do with HUD's obligation to promote the\nfair housing goals expressly declared in the Act.\nAn order shall enter substantially in accordance with the plaintiff's request.\n(d) Promulgation of Regulations\nThe plaintiff seeks an order that HUD promulgate regulations and guidelines which set forth standards for HUD's\nadministration and recipients' use of funds under HUD's housing and community development programs and\nactivities in accordance with Title VIII. Such an order is designed to facilitate meaningful compliance with and\nenforcement of fair housing goals. The request tracks my 1983 finding, which the plaintiff seeks to embody in the\ndeclaratory portion of the decree, that HUD failed to promulgate standards of performance or regulations under\nTitle VIII.\nIn addition to challenging the propriety of this demand, HUD represents that such rules and handbooks are\nalready in existence, citing as examples, Handbook No. 800.3: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Monitoring of\nCommunity Development Programs; 24 C.F.R. §§ 570.900, et seq. In addition, HUD points to recent statutory\nand regulatory amendments which impose more stringent standards on recipients of Fair Housing Assistance\nProgram Funds. The plaintiff concedes that new regulations have been proposed, but argues that they are\n370 inadequate in that they relate solely to the processing of private individual claims of discrimination, *370 and give\nno guidance to HUD or grantee administrators.\nThe court of appeals expressly noted that my remedial power under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), includes the\npower to compel the Secretary to promulgate regulations to carry out the intent of Congress, where he has failed\nto exercise his discretion to do so. NAACP v. HUD, supra, 817 F.2d at 160. Nevertheless, I am very reluctant to\nadd to the existing mountain of federal rules and regulations. I am only concerned with the specific local problems\nraised in this case. In my opinion the proper articulation of the conditions described above in each grant of HUD\nfunds will be sufficient to the occasion.\nORDER\nA declaratory judgment and final decree shall enter forthwith in accordance with the foregoing.\n\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND FINAL DECREE\nAfter a trial in this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and after consideration of the parties' submissions\nwith respect to remedies and in accordance with the memorandum filed herewith:\nI. Declaratory Relief\nIt is Declared that:\nA. During the period 1977 to 1982, in administering its programs and activities relating to housing and urban\ndevelopment in the City of Boston (\"the City\"), HUD did not satisfy minimum levels of compliance with Title VIII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5), as amended, to administer its programs and activities in a\nmanner affirmatively to further the policies of fair housing by:\n1. Failing to promulgate regulations or guidelines which adequately set forth standards for HUD's\nadministration and recipients' use of funds under HUD programs;\n2. Failing to secure a minority needs assessment from the City in a timely manner;\n3. Failing adequately to condition and monitor use of its funding by grantees and recipients, so as\nto assure the use of these monies to produce an adequate supply of affordable integrated family\nhousing; and\n4. Failing to require effective fair housing enforcement by the City.\nB. In light of HUD's failure to comply with its statutory mandate, and the resultant lack of affordable desegregated\nhousing, Metropolitan Area relief is appropriate under these circumstances, and to the extent provided in this\nDecree.\nII. Remedial Order\nIt is Ordered that:\nA. Metropolitan Area Relief\nHUD shall require the owners and managers of any assisted public or private housing within any city or town\nwithin the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area, including Boston (\"the Metropolitan Area\"), to participate fully in\navailable programs designed to facilitate access to suburban housing opportunities for low-income minority\nhouseholds now living in the City. These programs shall include, without limitation, the listing requirements and\naffirmative marketing programs created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this Decree.\nThe requirements of this Decree shall apply with equal force to all assisted housing in the Metropolitan Area.\n\"Assisted Housing\" means housing the cost of whose purchase, development, operation or rehabilitation is\nsubsidized in whole or in part with public funds or other resources, whether such funds or resources derive from\nfederal, state or local government.\nIn enforcing this Decree, HUD shall use any power it possesses to impose conditions on grantees, recipients, or\nbeneficiaries, pursuant to any grant or any other program.\n\nB. Fair Housing Conditions Upon Funding to the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts.\n371 Following entry of this Decree, HUD shall include in any approval of an application *371 for funding by the\nCommonwealth, under any grant or other program administered by HUD pursuant to which it has the power to\nimpose conditions upon grantees or recipients, the following conditions:\n1. That the Commonwealth require owners and operators of any state-assisted public or private housing available\nfor rental or sale in the Metropolitan Area to participate fully in programs designed to enhance access to low-\nincome housing by Black households, including but not limited to, Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing and\naffirmative marketing programs created pursuant to Sections II.C.3 of this Decree.\n2. That the Commonwealth promulgate legislation granting the Boston Fair Housing Commission (\"the\nCommission\") effective enforcement powers, including but not limited to, the power to issue subpoenas, levy\nfines and institute civil actions;\n3. That the Commonwealth prepare and provide such reports and statements regarding assisted housing in the\nMetropolitan Area as are required from time to time by HUD. Such submissions shall include, without limitation,\nreports on the racial and family composition of state-assisted housing, and a statement of the projected use of\nfunds and community development plan, as required by 42 U.S.C. § 5304.\nC. Fair Housing Conditions Upon Funding to the City\nFollowing entry of this Decree, HUD shall include in any approval of an application for funding by the City, under\nany grant or other program administered by HUD pursuant to which it has the power to impose conditions upon\ngrantees or recipients, the following conditions:\n1. That the City require the owners and operators of any City-assisted public or private housing available for\nrental or sale to participate fully in programs designed to enhance access to low-income housing by low-income\nBlack households, including but not limited to Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing and affirmative marketing\nprograms created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this Decree.\n2. That the City promulgate an amendment to its Fair Housing Ordinance eliminating the exemption of housing\nconsisting of five or fewer units;\n3. That within 60 days after HUD's approval of the application, the City design and submit to HUD and the plaintiff\nand, upon HUD's approval, implement a Fair Housing Program, to be administered by the Commission, including,\nwithout limitation, the following components:\na. A Boston Housing Opportunity Clearing Center, in which shall be listed all assisted public or\nprivate housing units available for sale or rental in the Metropolitan Area, which are required to be\nlisted by this Decree or any other authority, or any private units which are offered for listing by their\nowners or operators;\nb. A Fair Housing Law Enforcement Program, designed to identify and alleviate racially\ndiscriminatory practices in the sale and rental of housing in the City, which shall, without limitation:\n(i) Hear and investigate complaints of discriminatory practices;\n(ii) Bring administrative and judicial proceedings against persons engaging in discriminatory\npractices;\n(iii) Assist victims of discrimination by providing information as to rights and available remedies,\nand referrals to legal services organizations and private attorneys available to assist in\ndiscrimination claims.\n\nc. An Affirmative Marketing Program pursuant to 24 C.F.R. 200.620, which requires the owners\nand operators of assisted housing in the City to pursue affirmative fair housing marketing policies\nin soliciting buyers and tenants, in determining their eligibility, and in concluding sales and rental\ntransactions.\nThe Plan shall be designed to enhance the availability to persons of color of housing in\nneighborhoods which are now predominantly white. The goal of the Plan and its measure of\nsuccess shall be to achieve a racial composition in assisted housing, in neighborhoods which are\n372 predominantly *372 white, which reflects the racial composition of the City as a whole.\nd. A Fair Housing Public Education Program designed to make use of various public forums, such\nas broadcast media, bill boards, and community and social service organizations, to inform the\npublic of rights and available remedies under applicable fair housing and anti-discrimination laws\nand regulations, including but not limited to, the existence and functions of the Commission, the\nClearing Center, and of the other components of the Fair Housing Program;\n4. That the City prepare and submit to HUD such reports and statements regarding assisted housing as are\nrequired from time to time by HUD. Such submissions shall include, without limitation, a report on the racial and\nfamily composition of assisted housing, and a plan for the projected use of funds for community development, as\nrequired by 42 U.S.C. § 5304.\nD. Stock of Affordable Housing\n1. HUD shall use its best efforts and available resources to increase the supply of affordable integrated family\nhousing in the City, whether public, public-assisted, or private.\n2. HUD shall not agree to any disposition of HUD-assisted housing which has the effect of reducing the supply of\naffordable family housing in the City available as of the effective date of this Decree.\nIII. Monitoring and Reports\nCommencing three months after the effective date of this Decree and every six months thereafter, HUD shall\nsubmit to the court and serve upon the plaintiff:\nA. A report prepared by HUD or its grantees setting forth the current racial makeup, family composition and\nvacancy rate of HUD assisted housing projects or units in the City;\nB. A report describing the activities carried out and the results achieved in implementing this Decree.\nIV. Retention of Jurisdiction\nA. Jurisdiction is retained by the court for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff and HUD to apply to the court at\nany time for such further orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction, implementation,\nmodification or enforcement of this Decree.\nB. At any time after the fifth anniversary of the effective date, either HUD or the plaintiff may request the court to\nreview the progress made in implementing this Decree, and, based upon such review, to modify or terminate any\nand all rights or obligations provided therein.\nC. If HUD is unable to comply with its obligations under this Decree, for lack of authorization or any other reason,\nthe plaintiff may move for such comparable alternative relief as is appropriate.\n\nCLARIFICATION AND AMENDMENT OF JUDGMENT\nOn June 23, 1989, I issued a Declaratory Judgment and Final Decree (\"the Decree\"), setting forth the relief to be\naccorded the plaintiff N.A.A.C.P. The federal defendants move to amend the judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.\n59(e), in order to clarify HUD's obligations under the Decree and to modify certain aspects of the Decree which\nmight defeat its objectives. In general, the decree intentionally broadens the obligations of the defendants. It is a\nremedial decree as opposed to an order enforcing existing obligations.\n1. Inclusion of Section 8 Housing in Metropolitan Area Relief\nThe omission of a specific reference to the Section 8 rental subsidy program in section II.A of the Decree, dealing\nwith Metropolitan Area Relief, does not indicate an intent to exclude the program from this portion of the Decree.\nSection II.A, ¶ 1 sentence 2 is amended to read:\n\"These programs shall include, without limitation, Section 8 rental subsidies and the listing\n373 requirements and affirmative *373 marketing programs created pursuant to Section II.C.3 of this\nDecree.\"\n2. The Meaning of \"Assisted Housing\"\nHUD seeks clarification of the terms \"Assisted Housing\" and \"HUD-Assisted Housing.\" I hereby modify the\ndecree to expressly include within the definition of these terms (1) housing assisted by government insurance of\nprivate mortgage loans, and (2) housing created or developed under CDBG programs.\n3. \"Power to Condition\" Absolute or Conditional\nHUD questions whether the phrase \"power to condition\" in section II of the Decree leaves it the discretion to\nrefrain from conditioning programs with respect to which it has not made the factual findings normally prerequisite\nto the exercise of conditioning power.\nThe direction that HUD \"use any power it possesses to impose conditions\" applies with respect to any HUD\nprograms within the geographical reach of the Decree whose governing statutes and regulations include\nconditioning power. I expressly rule that HUD's obligation to impose the conditions set forth in the Decree is not\nlimited to circumstances in which it has made the factual findings normally prerequisite to the exercise of that\npower, and that it does not have the discretion to refrain from imposing the specified conditions.\n4. The Meaning of \"Available Resources\"\nThe term \"Available Resources\" refers to funds and other resources available to HUD at a Regional level, not\nnationwide.\nMy order that HUD \"use its best efforts and available resources\" to increase the supply of affordable integrated\nhousing, in section II.D of the Decree, does not direct the agency to make additional funding available or\notherwise to channel resources to the Boston Metropolitan Area beyond what the region would otherwise receive,\nbut only to maximize the extent to which available funds are used to provide such housing.\n5. Meaning of \"Affordable Housing\"\nSection II.D of the Decree obliges HUD to promote the supply of \"affordable integrated family housing\" in Boston.\nHUD requests modification of the Decree to define the term \"affordable,\" to facilitate its calculation of the size of\n\nthe current housing stock. HUD suggests a definition with respect to rental housing, but has no specific definition\nto proffer in the context of home ownership.\nI hereby modify the Decree to include the following, as section II.D.3:\na. \"Affordable housing\" means housing whose effective cost to a very low, low or moderate\nincome household does not exceed 30% of such household's combined net income.\nb. \"Very low-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not more than\n50% of the median income for the City of Boston.\nc. \"Low-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not less than 50%\nand not more than 80% of the median income for the City of Boston.\nd. \"Moderate-income household\" means a household whose combined income is not less than\n80% and not more than 95% of the median income for the City of Boston.\n6. References to \"Persons of Color\" and \"Blacks\"\nThe reference to \"persons of color\" is intentional, and will stand.\n7. Exemptions of Fair Housing Programs\nThe following HUD programs or actions are exempt from the Decree's conditioning requirements, since as\npresently constituted these programs support the remedial goals embodied in the Decree.\na. The approval of funds by HUD under the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP);\n374 *374 b. The execution of contracts between HUD's Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Office\n(FHEO) and a city or state agency, to perform fair housing investigations for HUD.\n[1] \"The decision of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\" 817 F.2d at 161.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The\nPlaintiff, National Association for the Advancement of Colored\nPeople (“NAACP”), has filed a Supplemental Complaint for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants: the\nSecretary of HUD, the Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”), and the\nCity of Boston (“the City”).  In the Supplemental Complaint,\nNAACP alleges breach of the consent decree by HUD, and breach of\nan agreement to modify the consent decree (“Modification\nAgreement”) by HUD, BHA, and the City.2  \n1 Pursuant to Fed.

P. 25(d), Secretary Shaun Donovan\nhas been substituted for former Secretary Alphonso Jackson.\n2 NAACP has asserted four specific causes of action, the\nfirst three of which are against HUD alone: Count I for breach of\nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the\nConsent Decree; Count II for declaratory judgment regarding HUD's\nobligations in requesting appropriations for the renewal of\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 2 of 45\nBHA filed two counterclaims against NAACP, alleging a\nseparate breach of the Modification Agreement and a failure to\namend the Modification Agreement, the latter of which has since\nbeen dismissed by stipulation.  BHA also filed two cross-claims\nagainst HUD for failure to comply with the Consent Decree and\nbreach of the Modification Agreement, but both cross-claims have\nalso now been dismissed by stipulation.  \nThe matter is before me on motions for judgment on the\npleadings or summary judgment filed variously by the parties\nregarding the surviving claims.3\nI. BACKGROUND\nA.  Factual Background\n1. The Original and Modified Consent Decrees\nThis case originated in 1978 when NAACP filed an action\nagainst HUD for failing “to carry out its statutory mandate to\npromote fair housing in connection with its administration of\nhousing and community development programs in the City of\nLitigation Vouchers; and Count III for breach of the Modified\nConsent Decree.  Count IV is against HUD, BHA, and the City for\nbreach of the Modification Agreement.\n3 Plaintiff NAACP has moved for summary judgment against\neach Defendant on the claims asserted in its Supplemental\nComplaint.  BHA has moved for summary judgment against NAACP as\nto the claim asserted against BHA in the Supplemental Complaint\nas well as on its own counterclaim against NAACP.  HUD has moved\nfor judgment on the pleadings against NAACP or, in the\nalternative, for dismissal of the Supplemental Complaint due to\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The City has moved for\njudgment on the pleadings and summary judgment as to NAACP’s\nclaim against it.  \n2\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 3 of 45\nBoston.”  N.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter v. Kemp (\"NAACP I\"), 721 F.\nSupp. 361, 363 (D. Mass. 1989) (providing background on the\norigins of the case).  Judge Skinner initially dismissed the case\non grounds that the District Court lacked the legal authority to\nreview HUD’s compliance with its federal Fair Housing Act (“Title\nVIII”) obligations.  Id.  The First Circuit, however, disagreed\nand remanded.  N.A.A.C.P. v. Sec’y of Housing & Urban Dev.\n(\"NAACP II\"), 817 F.2d 149, 157-61 (1st Cir. 1987) (Breyer, J.). \nUpon remand, Judge Skinner entered a declaratory judgment and\nfinal decree.  NAACP I, 721 F. Supp. at 370.  \nThereafter, the parties agreed to forego appeal and, to that\nend, entered into a consent decree that the court approved in\n1991 (“Original Consent Decree”).  Pursuant to the Original\nConsent Decree, HUD issued five hundred housing vouchers in the\nform of subsidies for Section 8 housing for use by a Boston\npublic housing agency.4  Four hundred subsidies were allocated to\nBHA and one hundred to the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment (“DHCD”), a Massachusetts state agency which\nsubcontracted the administration of the subsidies to the\nMetropolitan Boston Housing Partnership (“MBHP”).  Of the BHA’s\nfour hundred subsidies, three hundred were project-based and one\n4 Section 8 housing refers to the federal program that\nsubsidizes housing for low-income families and individuals\net\npursuant to the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § 1437 \nseq.\n Section 8 funding is appropriated to HUD, but the program is\nadministered by local housing authorities.\n3\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 4 of 45\nhundred were tenant-based.5 \nA dispute arose over the proper use of the project-based\nvouchers, and the units to be subsidized by these vouchers were\nnever built.  (Modification Agreement at 2.)  Faced with an\nimpasse, in 1999, HUD, BHA, the City, and NAACP entered into the\nModification Agreement “contingent upon the Court's approval of\nthe modification.”  (Modification Agreement at 4.)  On February\n8, 2000, Judge Skinner granted the parties’ Joint Motion to\nModify the Consent Decree (“Joint Motion”), and both the modified\nconsent decree (“Modified Consent Decree”) and the Modification\nAgreement became effective on that date. \nThe Modification Agreement changed the way BHA handled its\nfour hundred vouchers.  \nThe three hundred project-based vouchers\nwere converted into tenant-based subsidies.  Pursuant to the\nModification Agreement, BHA was to issue its four hundred tenant-\nbased vouchers (“Litigation Vouchers”) to “minority families\ndesirous of making an integrative move into a predominantly white\ncommunity,” often referred to in the parties’ submissions as\nHUD agreed to “provide Section 8 funding as\n“Skinner families.”  \npart of the settlement of the litigation . . . sufficient for at\nleast fifteen years dated from the date of this Agreement,\nsubject to the availability of appropriations.”  (Modification\n5 Tenant-based vouchers are subsidies awarded to individual\nfamilies, transferrable to other rental properties, while\nproject-based vouchers involve attaching a subsidy to a\nSee\nparticular housing unit.    24 C.F.R. § 982.1(b)(1)-(2).\n4\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 5 of 45\nAgreement at 13.)  In addition, HUD agreed to provide $640,000 in\nfunding for a housing choice program to provide counseling to\nminority families.  The housing choice was to be administered by\nthe Boston Fair Housing Commission (“BFHC”).  (Id.)\nThe Modification Agreement listed specific performance\nbenchmarks.  Portions of the Modification Agreement now at issue\nbefore me include those providing that:\nC If, at the end of the first six months after\nstart-up or after any subsequent six-month period,\nless than 33 percent of minority families meeting\ncertain criteria had moved into predominantly\nwhite neighborhoods, then the City and BHA agreed\nto solicit advice from NAACP on how to resolve the\nproblem.  (Modification Agreement at 10.)\n(cid:129) The term “start-up” was specifically defined in\nthe Modification Agreement as “the first 90 days\nafter 1) the BHA and HUD execute a contract to\nfund the housing choice program, 2) the City and\nthe BHA take all necessary steps to make this\nfunding available to the [BFHC], and 3) the funds\ncan be drawn upon by the BFHC.”  (Id.)\n(cid:129) The deadline for the BHA to issue\nits four hundred vouchers was set for “no later\nthan twenty-seven months after 1) the BHA and HUD\nexecute a contract to fund the housing choice\nprogram, 2) the City and the BHA take all\nnecessary steps to make this funding available to\nthe [BFHC], and 3) the funds can be drawn upon by\nthe BFHC.”  (Id. at 12.)\n(cid:129) BHA and HUD agreed to “promptly execute such a\ncontract to fund the housing choice program and\nthe BHA, HUD and the City agree to promptly take\nany other steps necessary to expeditiously make\nthis funding available to the BFHC.”  (Id.)\n(cid:129) “The goal and measure of success of the housing\nchoice program will be to assist at least 43\npercent of the participating minority families . .\n. to locate and secure housing in predominantly\nwhite neighborhoods.”  (Id. at 9.)\n5\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 6 of 45\n2. The Housing Choice Program\nHUD earmarked the $640,000 of housing choice program funding\nfor BHA prior to the effective date of the Modification\nAgreement.  But before the funding could be transferred to BHA\n(and ultimately BFHC), BHA and BFHC had to agree on the terms of\nthe housing choice program.  The discussions extended from\nJanuary 2001 through July 2002.  A housing choice program grant\nagreement was eventually executed on July 19, 2002, and funding\nfor the program was released to BFHC on August 26, 2002, two-and-\na-half years after the Modification Agreement became effective. \nDuring this period, NAACP made numerous inquiries as to progress\nin implementing the housing choice program. \n3. The Litigation Vouchers\nBHA contacted HUD, prior to 2001, to discuss the possibility\nof using its Litigation Vouchers for its regular waiting list. \nAlthough BHA had received its funding allocation for the\nLitigation Vouchers, the vouchers remained unused for a period of\ntime, and BHA was concerned with being classified as a “poor\nperformer” by HUD for having unused vouchers.  In response, HUD\nindicated that temporarily using the vouchers for non-Skinner\nfamilies was “an allowable use provided that [BHA] would\nguarantee that Skinner families would be taken care of out of\ntheir program when the need arose.”  From 2001 to 2003, BHA\ntemporarily issued Litigation Vouchers to homeless families\nliving in emergency shelters with the intention of replacing the\nvouchers through attrition. \n6\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 7 of 45\nIn 2003, BHA began experiencing problems with over-leasing.6\nThe BHA stopped issuing vouchers, but found the attrition rate to\nhave slowed.  BHA was therefore not able to replace the borrowed\nlitigation vouchers.   \nAs of April 30, 2004, only 260 Litigation Vouchers had been\nissued to minority families seeking to move to predominantly\nwhite neighborhoods.  In May and June of 2004, no Litigation\nVouchers were issued, and twenty families who had completed\nhousing counseling prior to May were still waiting for their\nvouchers.7  These families were issued Litigation Vouchers in\nAugust 2004.  BHA indicated that the remaining 120 vouchers would\nnot be issued until December 2004 due to constraints from the\nover-leasing problem.\n4. HUD Funding Change\nIn 2004, HUD proposed to Congress a plan to convert its\nfunding from a unit-based system to a dollar-based system.  In\nthe appropriation bill for HUD’s 2005 fiscal year, Congress\nadopted the dollar-based system and required local housing\nauthorities to operate within a fixed annual budget.  The 2005\nbudgets were based on average actual leasing and cost data for\n6 Over-leasing occurs when a housing authority has more\nvouchers under lease than it is authorized based on its HUD\nallocation. \nIn addition, on June 23, 2004, a woman contacted NAACP\n7 \nstating that she had completed her housing counseling in March\n2004 but was still awaiting her Litigation Voucher.  After\ncomplaints to BHA and BFHC, the woman reported that she was\nissued a Litigation Voucher.\n7\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 8 of 45\neach housing authority during the months of May, June, and July\n2004 (“Snapshot”).  \nFor the 2005 budget, HUD did not set out a separate line-\nitem request for the Litigation Vouchers, instead treating them\nin the same manner as any other voucher in the budget.  (Suppl.\nCompl. ¶ 36.)  Once a Litigation Voucher was issued to a housing\nauthority, the renewal of the Litigation Vouchers was treated the\nsame as any other voucher type. \nDuring the Snapshot, 217 Litigation Vouchers were under\nlease with an average subsidy of $1,264.72 per unit.  The\nremaining 183 Litigation Vouchers were being used by BHA as\ngeneral vouchers with an average subsidy of $977.05 per unit\nduring the Snapshot.  According to NAACP, if all four hundred\nLitigation Vouchers had been leased up during the Snapshot, BHA\nwould have received an additional $627,976 in funding for 2005.  \nCongress continued to use the dollar-based system for 2006\nfunding, and determined 2006 budgets by applying an adjustment\nfactor to each housing authority’s 2005 annual budget.  According\nto NAACP, if all four hundred Litigation Vouchers had been leased\nup during the Snapshot, BHA would have received an additional\n$640,119 in its 2006 annual budget. \nB. Procedural History\nNAACP initially filed a motion for an order to implement and\nenforce the Modified Consent Decree on May 23, 2005.  Because\nJudge Skinner had passed away, the case was transferred pursuant\nto this Court's random assignment process to my docket on June 1,\n8\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 9 of 45\n2005.  On January 19, 2006, I denied NAACP’s motion without\nprejudice pending further factual development.  On November 15,\n2006, NAACP filed its current Supplemental Complaint seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief from HUD for breach of its\nobligations pursuant to the Modified Consent Decree, and from\nHUD, BHA, and the City for breach of their obligations pursuant\nto the Modification Agreement.  The parties thereafter pressed\ntheir positions through the various dispositive motions now\nbefore me.  See note 2 supra.\nII. ANALYSIS\nIn resolving the motions, I must first address\njurisdictional issues as raised by HUD.  I then confront HUD's\nand the City's motions for judgment on the pleadings.  I turn\nthereafter to the several motions for summary judgment regarding\nthe claims raised in the Supplemental Complaint.  Finally, I will\naddress BHA’s motion for summary judgment on its remaining\ncounterclaim against NAACP.  \nA. Subject Matter Jurisdiction \nHUD challenges the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the\nclaims raised in NAACP’s Supplemental Complaint.  It disputes\nNAACP’s contention that both the Administrative Procedure Act\n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and the Modified Consent Decree\nprovide the Court with jurisdiction.  I address each of these\narguments in turn.\n1. APA Jurisdiction\nHUD raises three challenges to the applicability of the APA\n9\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 10 of 45\nin this case: a) there is no waiver of sovereign immunity\npursuant to the APA, because the Supplemental Complaint does not\nraise any statutory or regulatory violation; b) Norton v.\nSouthern Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55 (2004), calls into\nquestion use of the APA as a basis for enforcing the Modified\nConsent Decree; and c) because the APA only provides a waiver as\nto injunctive relief and not money damages, NAACP’s remedies -\ne.g., in ¶ D.4 (that “HUD shall provide the maximum funding\navailable and use its best efforts to obtain an appropriation for\nthe shortfall”) and ¶ D.5 (that “HUD, the BHA and the City shall,\njointly or severally, provide $295,000.00 to [the Metropolitan\nBoston Housing Partnership] to fund housing search counseling\nservices . . .”) of the Supplemental Complaint’s Request for\nRelief - cannot be granted under the APA.  I am persuaded by\nHUD’s first argument and find that the APA does not provide me\nwith authority to review this case.\nIt is important to note that the APA does not provide courts\nwith an implied grant of subject matter jurisdiction.  Califano\nv. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 107 (1977).  Instead, it lays out a\nframework for analyzing those challenged agency actions over \nwhich the court does have jurisdiction.  Sierra Club v. Martin,\n110 F.3d 1551, 1555 (11th Cir. 1997).\nIn order for the APA to waive HUD’s sovereign immunity,\nNAACP must show that HUD violated a statute or regulation.  The\nAPA states:\nA person suffering legal wrong because of agency\n10\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 11 of 45\naction, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency\naction within the meaning of a relevant statute, is\nentitled to judicial review thereof.  An action in a\ncourt of the United States seeking relief other than\nmoney damages and stating a claim that an agency or an\nofficer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in\nan official capacity or under color of legal authority\nshall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on\nthe ground that it is against the United States or that\nthe United States is an indispensable party.\n5 U.S.C. § 702 (emphasis added).  Courts have required parties\nseeking waiver under the APA to show a statutory or regulatory\nviolation.  See Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883\n(1990); Sierra Club, 110 F.3d at 1555 (“[T]here is no right to\nsue for a violation of the APA in the absence of a relevant\nstatute. . . .”) (citations omitted); Preferred Risk Mut. Ins.\nCo. v. U.S., 86 F.3d 789, 792 (8th Cir. 1996) (requiring that a\nplaintiff bringing an action under § 702 of the APA identify “a\nsubstantive statute or regulation that the agency action had\ntransgressed”); El Rescate Legal Servs., Inc. v. Executive Office\nof Immigration Review, 959 F.2d 742, 753 (9th Cir. 1991)\n(declaring that § 702 requires “a relevant statute whose\nviolation forms the legal basis for the complaint”) (internal\nquotations omitted).  In the original appeal brought by NAACP,\nthe First Circuit held that HUD was subject to APA waiver of its\nsovereign immunity because the alleged Title VIII violations did\nnot fall into any exceptions preventing the court from reviewing\nthe actions of HUD.  See NAACP II, 817 F.2d at 160.  HUD\ncorrectly notes, however, that the Plaintiff's Supplemental\nComplaint only refers to violations of the Consent Decree and\n11\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 12 of 45\nModification Agreement, and does not identify any Title VIII\nviolations. \nNAACP makes an argument for APA jurisdiction based on the Ex\nparte Young analysis conducted by the Supreme Court in Frew v.\nHawkins, 540 U.S. 431 (2004).  Frew involved “the intersection of\ntwo areas of federal law: the reach of the Eleventh Amendment and\nthe rules governing consent decrees.”  540 U.S. at 437.  In Frew,\nthe petitioners sought to enforce a federal consent decree that\nstate officials had entered into in order to resolve a Medicaid\nviolations suit.  Id. at 434-35.  The decree required state\nofficials to take certain actions that were not required under\nthe Medicaid statute.  Id. at 439.  The state officials argued\nthat court enforcement of the consent decree would involve the\nfederal court in matters beyond federal law, since the terms of\nthe consent decree were broader than actual requirements under\nfederal law.  Id. at 438.  Thus, they contended, “a federal court\nshould not enforce a consent decree arising from an Ex parte\nYoung suit unless the court first identifies, at the enforcement\nstage, a violation of federal law.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The\nSupreme Court rejected this argument by noting that “[t]he decree\nreflects a choice among various ways that a State could implement\nthe Medicaid Act.\"  Id. at 439.  Enforcing the decree therefore\n“vindicates an agreement that the state officials reached to\ncomply with federal law.”  Id.  NAACP argues that the Ex parte\nYoung analysis in Frew is also applicable here.  Since the APA\nwaiver has already been found in connection with the original\n12\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 13 of 45\nTitle VIII violation, NAACP argues, it is not required to show\nnow \nthat HUD’s violation of the Modified Consent Decree is also a\nviolation of a statute or regulation.\nFrew  Frew\nis distinguishable on two grounds.  First, \nSee \ninvolved a motion to enforce the consent decree.   540 U.S. at\n435.  The Plaintiff’s Supplemental Complaint seeks not only\nremedies for breach of the Consent Decree, but also for breach of\nthe Modification Agreement and breach of implied covenants of\ngood faith and fair dealing.  These latter claims do not touch\ndirectly upon the implementation of a federal statute.  Second,\nunlike the Eleventh Amendment, the APA, a federal statute that\nhas a fully developed scheme for judicial review, and under which\njurisdiction only arises upon the violation of a separate\nsee \nrelevant federal statute,  5 U.S.C. § 702, is before me here. \nNAACP's claims involving the Modification Agreement do not\ninvolve a violation of a separate statute or regulation.  Nor do\nstatutory or regulatory violations play a role in the alleged\nbreach of the Consent Decree.  Thus, I find that the APA does not\nprovide this Court with jurisdiction to hear NAACP's claims.\n2. Jurisdiction Under the Consent Decree\nBy contrast, the Consent Decree itself expressly provides\nthe court with ongoing jurisdiction.  Part IV.A of the Modified\nConsent Decree8 states: \n8 The language of Part IV remains unchanged by the\nmodifications to the Original Consent Decree.\n13\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 14 of 45\nJurisdiction is retained by the court for the purpose\nof enabling the plaintiff and HUD to apply to the court\nat any time for such further orders as may be necessary\nor appropriate for the construction, implementation,\nmodification or enforcement of this Decree.  However,\nno additional funding obligations not already\nexplicitly contained in this Decree shall be imposed on\nHUD.  \nIn addition, under Part IV.C, if HUD is unable to meet its\nobligation under the Decree, \n“either party may move for such\ncomparable alternative relief as is appropriate”; such relief,\nhowever, “may not result in an increase in HUD’s financial\nobligations as specified in this Decree.”  \nHUD acknowledges that the Consent Decree provides this Court\nwith continuing jurisdiction over the enforcement of the\nobligations under the Decree.  But HUD argues that this grant of\njurisdiction may not be used to impose greater obligations on HUD\nthan the Consent Decree requires.  HUD's arguments, however, are\nprimarily attacks on the remedies sought by NAACP.  I will take\nup the question of remedies when I address the merits of the\nPlaintiff's allegations in the Supplemental Complaint.  On the\nquestion of jurisdiction, I need only determine whether this\nCourt has the authority to hear NAACP's claims of breach of the\nConsent Decree and Modification Agreement.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction over the Supplemental Complaint\nnot only under the express language of the Consent Decree, but\nalso under the principle that courts have inherent jurisdiction\nSee Riggs v. Johnson County\nto enforce their decrees.   , 73 U.S.\n14\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 15 of 45\n166, 187 (1867) (“[T]he rule is universal, that if the power is\nconferred to render the judgment or enter the decree, it also\nincludes the power to issue proper process to enforce such\njudgment or decree.”).  A trial court retains its jurisdiction to\nenforce its consent decrees if it had proper jurisdiction over\nSee Beckett v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n\nthe original case.   , 995 \nF.2d 280, 286 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citing the principle that a trial\ncourt retains jurisdiction over its consent decrees).  \nThis “ancillary jurisdiction,” however, can be used only to\nserve two limited purposes: a) to permit disposition of claims\nthat are factually interdependent, and b) to enable a court to\n“function successfully, that is to manage its proceedings,\nRicci v.\nvindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.”  \nPatrick Kokkonen v.\n, 544 F.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting \nGuardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.  \n, 511 U.S. 375, 379-80 (1994)).  The\nRicci \nFirst Circuit in  did not directly address whether a court\nhad jurisdiction over a complaint whose request for relief may\nextend beyond the terms of the original order.  The specific\nholding was that ancillary jurisdiction does not extend to\nreopening an order absent a showing that the terms of the order\nRicci\nhad been violated.   , 544 F.3d at 22.  But the First Circuit\nRicci Kokkonen \nin   emphasized the principle developed in  that\ndistrict courts lack a “free-ranging” ancillary jurisdiction, and\n15\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 16 of 45\nthat there is no federal court jurisdiction to revisit a\nsettlement agreement where the relevant court order lacked a\nId.  Kokkonen\nprovision retaining jurisdiction.   (citing  , 511 U.S.\nPigford v. Veneman\nat 381, and  , 292 F.3d 918, 924 (D.C. Cir.\n2002)). \nUnder these guiding principles, I find that this Court has\njurisdiction to hear NAACP's claims under the Consent Decree and\nthe Modification Agreement.  The Original Consent Decree\nexplicitly provided this Court with jurisdiction for “such\nfurther orders as may be necessary or appropriate” for the\nenforcement of the Decree.  The Modified Consent Decree made no\nchanges to this jurisdictional provision.  In these\ncircumstances, this Court has jurisdiction to address questions\nof both breach and remedy, in order to effectuate the Consent\nDecree as modified by the Joint Motion and the Modification\nAgreement.9\nThis court maintains jurisdiction to exercise power to\n“modify its decree in light of changed circumstances,” a power\nsee also Frew\nreflected in Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5);    , 540 U.S. at\nRicci, \n441;  544 F.3d at 20.  However, it can make modifications\n9The modifications to the Consent Decree were never captured\nin a single document.  Rather, the modifications were contained\nin the Joint Motion, which provided a brief summary of the\nchanges embodied in the Modification Agreement, and the much more\ndetailed Modification Agreement, which was incorporated by\nreference into the Joint Motion.  Judge Skinner thereafter\ngranted the motion without an opinion. \n16\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 17 of 45\nto consent decrees only on a showing of “a significant change in\n Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail\ncircumstances,” , 502 U.S.\n367, 383 (1992), which the party seeking modification has the\nRicci\nburden to demonstrate.   , 544 F.3d at 20-21.  To the extent\nthat NAACP requests further modifications to the Consent Decree,\nI will evaluate such requests under the demanding standard\nRufo  Ricci\noutlined in  and  .\nB. Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings\nBoth HUD and the City have moved for judgment on the\npleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.  Rule 12(c) permits dismissal “[a]fter the pleadings\nare closed--but early enough not to delay trial.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(c).  In reviewing a motion under Rule 12(c), “the district\ncourt must accept all the nonmoving party's well-pleaded factual\naverments as true and draw all reasonable inferences in her\nFeliciano v. Rhode Island\nfavor.”   , 160 F.3d 780, 788 (1st Cir.\n1998).\n1.  HUD's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\nHUD, although conceding that the Court has jurisdiction over\ncompliance with the Consent Decree, argues that the Court cannot\nreview the Supplemental Complaint, which it says exceeds the\nterms of judicial review established in the Consent Decree.  Part\nIV of the Decree states that “[j]urisdiction is retained by the\ncourt . . . for such further orders as may be necessary or\n17\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 18 of 45\nappropriate for the construction, implementation, modification or\nenforcement of this Decree.”  HUD argues that under these terms,\nNAACP's remedies are limited to orders from the court through\nmotions governed by the standards of civil contempt.  HUD\ncontends that it would violate the terms of the Decree to permit\nnew non-contempt claims, requiring the Plaintiff to satisfy a\nburden only by a preponderance of the evidence at trial.\nWhile NAACP did, in fact, file motions for enforcement\norders pursuant to the Consent Decree at the beginning of this\nstage of the litigation, I specifically gave the Plaintiff leave\nto file this Supplemental Complaint in November 2006, and denied\nthe City's motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6).  The procedural device of a complaint is not\ninappropriate in these circumstances:  NAACP's causes of action\nconcern not only breach of the Consent Decree but also of the\nModification Agreement; and NAACP's named Defendants include not\nonly HUD, but also BHA and the City.\nEven if I were to treat the Supplemental Complaint as a\nmotion by another name, I am not obligated to treat it only as a\nmotion for contempt.  The Consent Decree states simply that\nparties can apply for “such further orders as may be necessary.” \nHUD itself admits that orders under the Decree could include\nmotions for contempt, motions for enforcement, or motions for\nfurther orders.  A motion for enforcement may proceed separately\n18\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 19 of 45\nSee Nextel Comm. of Mid-Atlantic v.\nfrom a motion for contempt.  \nTown of Hanson\n, 311 F. Supp. 2d 142, 159-60 (D. Mass. 2004).\nIt appears that one of HUD's major concerns is ensuring that\nNAACP is held to a demanding burden of proof.  HUD observes that\nif NAACP had pursued a motion for enforcement of the Consent\nDecree, the case law of civil contempt would apply, which, HUD\ncontends, “places the burden squarely on the Plaintiff to\nestablish by clear and convincing evidence that HUD, inter alia,\nviolated the Consent Decree and/or Modification Agreement.”  HUD\nobserves that this standard is higher than the burden on the\nPlaintiff in a motion for summary judgment or at trial.  While\nthe observation is accurate, the concern is misplaced as a matter\nof pleading.  To the extent that there is disagreement regarding\nthe burden of proof on the Plaintiff in this case, that is no\nbasis for the dismissal of the Supplemental Complaint under Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(c).  Rather, what is presented is a dispute over\nthe legal standard to be applied to the facts and theories in\nthis case, and that is a matter to be taken up when evaluating\nthe parties' respective motions for summary judgment or at trial\nitself.\n2. The City's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\nThe City raises two arguments in support of its motion for\njudgment on the pleadings.  First, it argues that the\nModification Agreement cannot be enforced independently from the\n19\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 20 of 45\nModified Consent Decree under a breach of contract cause of\naction.  Second, the City argues that the court lacks\nsupplemental jurisdiction over NAACP's claims against the City.\na. The Modification Agreement as an Enforceable\nContract\nLike HUD, the City argues that NAACP's only viable\nenforcement mechanism is a motion for contempt.  The City's\nposition relies on the premise that the Modification Agreement is\nnot independently enforceable from the Modified Consent Decree. \nThe City argues that “the Modification Agreement became part of\nthe [Modified Consent] Decree,” and therefore, the Modification\nAgreement itself should be viewed as a consent decree, rather\nthan as a contract.  According to the City, NAACP therefore has\nno valid breach of contract cause of action against the City. \nNAACP counters that even though the Modification Agreement was\nincorporated by reference into the Modified Consent Decree, “it\nbecame and remains a separate and independent basis for claims\namong the parties to it.”  \nThere appears to be little in the way of case law discussing\nwhether a party can bring a breach of contract claim based on an\nagreement that has been incorporated by reference into a consent\nSee Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West\ndecree.  \nVirginia Dep't of Health and Human Resources\n, 532 U.S. 598, 604\nn.7 (2001) (noting that “federal jurisdiction to enforce a\nprivate contractual settlement will often be lacking unless the\n20\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 21 of 45\nterms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of\n Fitzpatrick v. Queen\ndismissal”); , No. 03-4318, 2005 WL 1172376,\nat *5 (E.D. Pa. May 16, 2005) (“It is unclear whether an\naggrieved party retains the option of asserting an ordinary\nbreach of contract claim where the agreement upon which the claim\nis based has been incorporated into a consent decree.”).\nUpon careful review of the Joint Motion and the Modification\nAgreement, however, I find NAACP's argument persuasive.  Although\na number of terms of the Modification Agreement are discussed in\nthe Joint Motion, many key terms are not.  These differences make\nthe Modification Agreement sufficiently distinct from the\nModified Consent Decree to support a breach of contract claim. \nThis leads me to conclude that I have jurisdiction to hear a\nbreach of contract claim against the City with respect to the\nModification Agreement.\nb. Supplemental Jurisdiction over Claims Against \nthe City\nThe City next argues that because this Court has no\njurisdiction over the claims against HUD, it also lacks\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the claims against the City.  I\nhave already concluded that this Court has jurisdiction to hear\nsupra.\nthe claims against HUD, Part II.A.2.,    Consequently, I\nfind that this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the\nbreach of contract claim against the City, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1367(a).  Because I find that the Modification Agreement is\n21\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 22 of 45\nindependently enforceable under a claim for breach of contract,\nand because this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over that\nclaim, I will deny the City's motion for judgment on the\npleadings.\nC. Motions for Summary Judgment\n1.  Standard of Review\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and affidavits show that\n“there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n.”  Fed.\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\nR. Civ. P. 56(c).  The moving party bears the burden of\ndemonstrating “an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving\nparty’s case.”  Clifford v. Barnhart, 440 F.3d 276, 280 (1st Cir.\n2006) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Caltrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325\n(1986)).  I view the record in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party.  Collazo v. Nicholson, 535 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir.\n2008). \n2. Burden of Proof\nAs noted above, a plaintiff like NAACP, pursuing claims\nbased on non-compliance with decrees and related agreements, can\nface varying burdens of proof depending on the nature of its\nclaims.  HUD has argued that NAACP is essentially pursuing (or\nought to pursue) enforcement of the decree through a contempt\nproceeding, based on alleged violations of the Modified Consent\nDecree.  For a contempt claim, NAACP would bear the burden of\n22\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 23 of 45\nproving “by clear and convincing evidence” that the Defendants\nAMF Inc. v.\nwere in violation of the Modified Consent Decree.  \nJewett\n, 711 F.2d 1096, 1100 (1st Cir. 1983).  HUD argues that\nthis Court must hear NAACP’s claims based on the “clear and\nconvincing evidence” standard, rather than the less demanding\n“preponderance of the evidence” rule.  But NAACP has chosen to\npursue its claims using the traditional pleading device, and I\nsee no reason to depart from the “preponderance of the evidence”\nburden of proof unless contempt claims are expressly asserted.\nThere is, nevertheless, a separate dimension to claims\nregarding proposed changes to the Modified Consent Decree. \nModification of a consent decree results in “a permanent, facial\nBrewster v. Dukakis\nchange in the decree.”     , 675 F.2d 1, 3 (1st\nCir. 1982).  “A party seeking modification of a consent decree\nbears the burden of establishing that a significant change in\nRufo\ncircumstances warrants revision of the decree.”   , 502 U.S.\nsee also Ricci,\nat 383;     544 F.3d at 20-21.  If the party meets\nthis standard, “the court should consider whether the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.” \nRufo,\n 502 U.S. at 383. \n3. Motions for Summary Judgment on the Supplemental \nComplaint\nNAACP moves for summary judgment on each count in the\nSupplemental Complaint.  Although the Supplemental Complaint\nidentifies four separate causes of action, all of NAACP's claims\n23\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 24 of 45\nare concededly and effectively for breach of contract.  \nTo support its argument that HUD, BHA, and the City have\nbreached their obligations under the Modification Agreement,\nNAACP presents several specific breach of contract contentions. \nFirst, it contends that HUD, BHA, and the City breached their\nobligation in the Modification Agreement to make the $640,000\ncounseling grant fund available to BFHC “expeditiously.”  Second,\nit contends that HUD, BHA and the City breached their obligation\nto restrict the availability and use of the Litigation Vouchers\nto minority families desirous of making an integrative move to a\npredominantly white neighborhood.  The third contention, also\nrelated to the Litigation Vouchers, is that HUD, BHA and the City\nbreached their obligation to complete the distribution of\nLitigation Vouchers within the time prescribed by the\nModification Agreement.  BHA and the City have moved for summary\njudgment on the claims in the Supplemental Complaint.\na. The Housing Counseling Grant Contention\nNAACP’s first contention is that HUD, BHA, and the City all\nbreached their obligation under the Modification Agreement to\nmake the housing counseling grant of $640,000 available to BFHC\nexpeditiously.  Pursuant to the Modification Agreement, “[t]he\nBHA and HUD agree to promptly execute . . . a contract to fund\nthe housing choice program and the BHA, HUD, and the City agree\npromptly expeditiously\nto   take any other steps necessary to   make\n24\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 25 of 45\nthis funding available to the BFHC.”  (Modification Agreement at\n12 (emphasis added).)  The Modification Agreement became\neffective on February 8, 2000 and HUD had already identified\n$640,000 for the housing choice fund in the fall of 1999.  Before\nthe funds could be released, however, BHA and the City, through\nBFHC, had to agree on the terms of the housing choice program,\nand discussions extended from January 2001 through July 2002.  An\nagreement was finalized on July 19, 2002.  After two-and-a-half\nyears, the $640,000 funding was released to BFHC on August 26,\n2002.  NAACP argues that this two-and-a-half year delay in\nreleasing the funds shows that the Defendants failed to\n“expeditiously” make the funds available.  I turn now to the task\nof interpreting this term in the Modification Agreement.  \nBHA offers several arguments about the interpretation of a\nconsent decree that miss the point.  It states that I should look\nU.S. v. Armour &\nat the “four corners” of the Consent Decree.  \nCo.\n, 402 U.S. 673, 682 (1971).  Specifically, it argues that\nNAACP is seeking to enforce “an additional term beyond the scope\nFox v. U.S. Dep’t of\nof [the other party’s] consent” (citing \nHousing & Urban Dev.\n, 680 F.2d 315, 322 (3d Cir. 1982)).  But\nwhat NAACP is actually seeking is an interpretation of the word\n“expeditiously” given that the Modification Agreement imposes no\nspecific time limit for providing the $640,000 of funding.\nThe question is whether this two-and-a-half year delay\n25\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 26 of 45\nsatisfies the obligation to act \"expeditiously\" as a matter of\nlaw.  Analysis of the Modification Agreement for purposes of a\nbreach of contract claim or as an effort to obtain an order to\nenforce a consent decree is essentially the same, since “a\nconsent decree . . . is to be construed for enforcement purposes\n  U.S. v. ITT Cont'l Baking Co., 420\nbasically as a contract.”\nU.S. 223, 238 (1975).  Similarly, “[w]hen interpreting the terms\nof a consent decree, the court applies general contract\nprinciples using the law of the state where the agreement was\nmade.”  Collins v. Thompson, 8 F.3d 657, 659 (9th Cir. 1993).  In\nMassachusetts, when a contract fails to provide a specific time\nlimit, “the law will impute a reasonable time limitation.” \nMicromuse, Inc. v. Micromuse, PLC, 304 F. Supp. 2d 202, 210 n.9\n(D. Mass. 2004).  \nReasonableness is best evaluated in light of the behavior of\nall the parties.  HUD is a large federal agency that is, for the\nmost part, not in the business of micro-managing local housing\nauthorities.  It made the $640,000 available to BHA and was\nwaiting for BHA and the City to finish their negotiations. \nAlthough City files indicate an original implementation schedule\nwith program start-up in January 2001, the schedule also\nindicated there were significant funding issues that needed to be\nresolved.  In September 2001, BFHC presented NAACP with two\nproposed counseling plans, a basic option and a full-service\noption.  NAACP did not respond until December 2001 when it\n26\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 27 of 45\nindicated that it preferred the basic option.  A \ntwo-and-a-half\nyear delay seems more reasonable given that it took NAACP some\nthree months to evaluate two completed proposals.    \nBHA argues that the term “expeditiously” should be\ninterpreted in the context of the obligations and tasks that were\nundertaken.  While a draft housing choice counseling plan had\nalready been prepared and attached as an exhibit to the\nModification Agreement, the basic option housing choice plan that\nwas ultimately adopted incorporated changes to the self-\nsufficiency workshop, landlord outreach, and post-occupancy\nservices.  \n years may seem a relatively long time to\nTwo-and-a-half\nwait; however, the relevant question is whether it was an\nunreasonably long time.  One can share NAACP’s frustration with\nthe lengthy process, which appears to have involved some\nleisurely bureaucratic wrangling, but the record shows that it\nalso involved lengthy discussions and resolution of funding\nissues.  As BHA notes, if NAACP felt so strongly that the\nLitigation Vouchers program should start before the end of 2000,\nit should have negotiated to include such a precise deadline in\nthe Modification Agreement.  Alternatively, it could have moved\nfor relief at that time.  Other provisions of the agreement are\nquite time-specific, such as the requirement that all vouchers be\nissued within twenty-seven months of funding.  Based on these\nfacts, I find that HUD, BHA, and the City acted reasonably given\nthe circumstances and, as a matter of law, did not breach the\n27\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 28 of 45\nModification Agreement to “promptly take any other steps\nnecessary to expeditiously make [the] funding available.”  Thus,\nI will deny NAACP’s motion for summary judgment as to this\ncontention and correspondingly grant summary judgment to each\nDefendant.\nb. The Litigation Voucher Contentions\nNAACP presents two contentions focusing on the Litigation\nVouchers: that HUD, BHA and the City breached an obligation to\nrestrict the Litigation Vouchers to eligible families as\ndescribed in the Joint Motion and Modification Agreement; and\nthat HUD, BHA and the City breached their obligation to complete\ndistribution of the Litigation Vouchers within the time\nprescribed by the Modification Agreement.  The claims are\ninterrelated, and I address the latter issue first.10  \ni. Compliance with the twenty-seven month \ndeadline\nNAACP argues that failure to complete Litigation Voucher\nissuance before December 2004 is a breach of the Modification \n10 I note that BHA raises the affirmative defense that any\nbreach of contract claim brought by NAACP is barred by the\nstatute of limitations.  Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff has\nsix years from the date of the alleged breach to bring a breach\nof contract claim.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2.  As to the\nobligation only to issue Litigation Vouchers to eligible\nfamilies, however, a breach could not have occurred until after\nthe funding of the $640,000 housing counseling grant in August\n2002.  Therefore, this particular breach of contract claim is not\nbarred by the statute of limitations.  Moreover, any breach of\ncontract claim based upon lack of timeliness in funding of the\nhousing counseling grant before August 2002 is foreclosed by my\ndetermination of the housing counseling grant contention in Part\nsupra\nII.C.3.a.,  .\n28\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 29 of 45\nAgreement.  The relevant language in the Modification Agreement\nstates:\nAll four hundred Section 8 tenant-based subsidies will\nbe issued to minority families desirous of making an\nintegrative move into a predominantly white community\nby no later than twenty-seven months after 1) the BHA\nand HUD execute a contract to fund the housing choice\nprogram, 2) the City and the BHA take all necessary\nsteps to make this funding available to the [BFHC], and\n3) the funds can be drawn upon by the BFHC. \n \n(Modification Agreement at 12.)  NAACP states that the BHA did\nnot begin issuing Litigation Vouchers until June 2003, nearly ten\nmonths after the counseling grant was released.  NAACP contends\nthat there was “minimal activity in distributing vouchers in\n2004\" and the final distribution was not completed until the very\nend of the year.  NAACP dismisses as inadequate the reasons for\nthe slow progress, including BHA’s problems with over-leasing and\nthe diversion of the Litigation Vouchers for use by ineligible\nfamilies.  \nI find NAACP's allegations state at most an immaterial\nbreach under the timing provision of the Modification Agreement. \nUnlike other provisions of the Modification Agreement that use\n the timing\nflexible terms such as “promptly” and “expeditiously,”\nprovision for distribution specifically imposes a twenty-seven\nmonth window for the issuance of all four hundred Litigation\nVouchers.  The twenty-seven month period starts when “the funds\ncan be drawn upon by the BFHC.”  It is undisputed that the funds\n29\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 30 of 45\nwere made available to BFHC on August 26, 2002.  Twenty-seven\nmonths from this date would be November 26, 2004.  All four\nhundred vouchers were issued by December 31, 2004. \nUnderstandably, NAACP does not argue that a one-month delay in\nmeeting the full issuance obligation represents a material breach\nof the Modification Agreement.\nRather, NAACP argues that the delay in releasing the\n$640,000 to BFHC caused the twenty-seven month window to be\nshifted back, as a consequence of which the true window of time\nshould be measured from December 2000 through March 2003.  But\nthis is merely a reiteration of its contention that HUD, BHA, and\nthe City breached the Modification Agreement by failing to\nrelease the funds to BFHC expeditiously, a contention I have\nalready discussed and rejected in Part II.C.3.a., supra.  How a\nparty would perform ideally is not the same as how a party is\nlegally obligated to perform.  The Modification Agreement\nlanguage is clear:  The subsidies will be issued “no later than\ntwenty-seven months after . . . the [$640,000 of] funds can be\ndrawn upon by the BFHC.”  There was no requirement for BHA to\ncomplete issuance prior to this time, nor was there an obligation\nfor HUD to hold BHA to an earlier completion time.  Exceeding by\none month the issuance of some vouchers was not a material\nbreach.  Thus, I will deny NAACP’s motion for summary judgment\nand correspondingly grant summary judgment to the Defendants as\nto this contention. \n30\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 31 of 45\nii. Restoration to eligible minority families\nNAACP raises the separate contention that HUD, BHA and the\nCity breached their obligation to restrict the availability of\nthe Litigation Vouchers to minority families desirous of making\nan integrative move to a predominantly white neighborhood.  In\nthe Joint Motion, the parties asked the Court to modify the\nOriginal Consent Decree such that the subsidies “will be made\navailable only to minority families, and for the first 120 days,\nmay be used by such families only for housing located in\npredominantly white neighborhoods, as more fully described in the\nattached [Modification Agreement].”  (Joint Motion at 1 (emphasis\nadded).)  The Modification Agreement directed that BHA’s three\nhundred newly designated tenant-based vouchers were to be\n“provided exclusively to minority families on the [BHA] waiting\nlist desirous of making an integrative move to a predominantly\nwhite neighborhood.”\n  (Modification Agreement at 5 (emphasis\nadded).)  In addition, BHA’s original one hundred Section 8\ntenant-based subsidies were to be provided to minority families\nwho were already living in predominantly white neighborhoods or\nId.\nwho wanted to move to predominantly white neighborhoods.  (  at\n5-6.)\nIt is undisputed that BHA sought HUD’s approval regarding\nuse of the Litigation Vouchers for individuals not eligible under\nthe Modification Agreement, and did in fact use the Litigation\nVoucher subsidies to issue vouchers to ineligible individuals and\n31\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 32 of 45\nfamilies.  From 2001 to 2003, BHA used the Litigation Voucher\nsubsidy to issue vouchers to homeless families living in\nemergency shelters “with the intention of replacing such funding\nthrough attrition.”    \nWhen BHA began experiencing problems with over-leasing in\n2003, HUD and BHA worked together on a plan to address the\nproblem, including the possibility of deferring issuance of the\nLitigation Vouchers beyond the twenty-seven month window.  In\nDecember 2003, HUD questioned BHA regarding the impact of the\ndeferral and one month later, it told the BHA that it “must\ncontact” NAACP to discuss BHA’s need for deferral and that\ndeferral “without the knowledge and approval of all parties to\nthe [Modification] Agreement would be ill-advised.”  \nAs of April 30, 2004, 260 Litigation Vouchers had been\nBHA issued the remaining 140 vouchers by December 2004.  \nissued.  \nNAACP alleges that these facts show a violation by HUD, BHA\nand the City of their obligation to ensure that the Litigation\nVouchers were issued only to minority families desirous of making\nan integrative move.  This characterization appears overdrawn,\nhowever, given the fact that BHA issued substantially all of the\nLitigation Vouchers to those eligible within the twenty-seven\nmonth window provided by the Litigation Modification Agreement. \nTo be sure, certain of the Litigation Vouchers were used before\nthe deadline for housing of persons not eligible under the\nModified Consent Decree and the Modification Agreement until\n32\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 33 of 45\neligibility was established.  But this short-term parking\narrangement, benefitting others in need of housing, does not seem\naltogether unreasonable while eligibility was established under a\nnew and ambitious program.  Nevertheless, interpretation of the\nModified Consent Decree and Modification Agreement are governed\nby basic contract law.  Citation Ins. Co. v. Gomez, 688 N.E.2d\n951, 953 (Mass. 1998).  The language in the Modification\nAgreement and Joint Motion is unambiguous.  The Joint Motion\nstates that the “subsidies . . . will be made available only to\nminority families” and the Modification Agreement states that the\nconverted Section 8 “subsidies . . . will be provided exclusively\nto minority families . . . desirous of making an integrative move\nto a predominantly white neighborhood.”\n  HUD and BHA failed for a\ntime to restrict the availability and use of the Litigation\nVouchers as required.\nThat being said, I find NAACP has failed to demonstrate harm\nsignificant enough to establish a material breach.  \nc. Alleged Harms\nNAACP identifies two possible harms from the breach of the\nduty to restrict availability: harm to the families who were\nforced to wait unnecessarily for their vouchers; and harm to\nrenewal funding in 2005 and 2006 as a result of the deviations in\ndistribution.  Neither can be said to constitute a material\nbreach.\n33\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 34 of 45\ni. Harm to families\nNAACP argues that the breach of the exclusivity provision\nharmed eligible families who were forced to wait longer than they\notherwise would have for their vouchers.  The Plaintiff has\nfailed to demonstrate cognizable harm to these families.  NAACP\nhas stated that twenty families had completed the BFHC counseling\nprogram, and were referred to the BHA for Litigation Vouchers in\nFebruary, March, and April 2004.  All twenty of those families\nhad been issued Litigation Vouchers by August 2004.  This delay\nof four to six months in obtaining the vouchers, experienced by\ntwenty families, may have caused some cognizable harm, but what\ntype, e.g., economic harm in the form of higher interim housing\ncosts, or more generally a dignitary harm from delay in\nvindication of the right to an integrated housing experience, is\nnot specified.  NAACP, in any event, has not presented facts that\ndemonstrate such consequences.  Moreover, all twenty families had\ntheir vouchers provided well before the deadline of November\n2004.\nii. Harm to renewal funding\nThe second harm identified by NAACP is said to be reduction\nin renewal funding for the Litigation Vouchers in 2005 and 2006. \nThe 2005 budgets were based on the 2004 Snapshot of leasing and\ncost data.  NAACP argues that because the Litigation Vouchers\nshould have been leased up by mid-2004, there was a reduction in\n34\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 35 of 45\nthe average voucher subsidy to BHA.  For their part, the\nDefendants argue that NAACP's reasoning is flawed and counter\nthat BHA's over-leasing problem led to receipt of funding in\nexcess of what it would otherwise have received had Litigation\nVouchers been left unassigned.  At a minimum, whatever the effect\nupon BHA’s overall subsidy, the assignment of Litigation\nVouchers, albeit in certain cases to non-eligible families,\nassured the Litigation Vouchers were counted in the Snapshot in\nsome form.  NAACP has based its calculations of funding on the\nhypothesis that all four hundred Litigation Vouchers would have\nbeen leased up during the Snapshot.  There is no evidence,\nhowever, how many Litigation Vouchers would actually have been\nleased up during this time period, had BHA not distributed some\nof the vouchers to non-eligible families.  More to the point, HUD\nprovided funding to BHA as a fixed, dollar-based budget that\nencompassed all of BHA’s Section 8 voucher programs.  Any\nshortfalls, had they occurred, would have arisen in BHA’s lump-\nsum allotment from HUD, rather than in specific funding for the\nLitigation Vouchers.  NAACP therefore cannot demonstrate any\ncognizable harm in terms of funding shortfalls.\nd. Remedies\nAs a cross-check against my determination that no material\nbreach of and no cognizable harm for the Modification Agreement\nand Consent Decree has been demonstrated, I will analyze the\n35\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 36 of 45\npurported harms from the perspective of the fit between the\nremedies the NAACP seeks and the harms it has claimed.  I find\nthat none of the remedies sought fit the harms asserted.  Rather,\nit appears that relatively insignificant harms are being used as\na spring board to seek substantial and arguably unauthorized\nmodifications in the Consent Decree.\nNAACP's remedies, whether characterized as injunctive relief\nfor breach of contract or as a modification of the Consent\nDecree, must match the harms or circumstances that have occurred. \nAs a general proposition, injunctive relief must be “properly\n  Pino v. Protection\ntailored to remedy the specific harm shown.”\nMaritime Ins. Co., Ltd.\n, 599 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1979)\n(internal citations omitted).  Further, the relief sought by\nNAACP is more than general injunctive relief.  It seeks a\nsubstantial modification of the Consent Decree. \nRufo\nAs explained in  , a modification of a consent decree\nmust be “suitably tailored” to a significant change in\nsee also Ricci\ncircumstances.  502 U.S. at 383;  , 544 F.3d at 21\n(finding that no significant change in factual circumstances or\nthe law had occurred that would justify reopening the consent\nRufo\ndecree).  The First Circuit, citing  , has held that a consent\ndecree must be changed “no more than necessary to resolve the\nproblems created by the change in circumstances,” and “must not\n  King v.\ndefeat the core purpose of the consent decree.”\n36\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 37 of 45\nGreenblatt\n, 149 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1998).  The courts have\npoliced the narrow tailoring obligation sensitively.  For\nThompson v. U.S. Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev.\nexample, in  , 404\nF.3d 821 (4th Cir. 2005), the court permitted a modification that\nextended the period of jurisdiction over HUD because doing so\nwould “ensure that the Decree can be efficiently enforced,” and\nId.\nthe extension was “no more than was necessary.”    at 831-32. \nLorain NAACP v. Lorain Bd. of Educ.\nYet in  , 979 F.2d 1141 (6th\nCir. 1992), where a board of education sought an increase in Ohio\nstate funding to cover the costs of a consent decree's\ndesegregation plan - which explicitly capped state liability at\n$1 million - the court found that the state had committed no\nconstitutional violation, and its assumption of liability in a\ndifferent city “does not in any way justify the judicial\nmodification” to increase the state's liability cap under the\nId.\nconsent decree.    at 1152.\nWith these legal principles in mind, I turn to the three\ngeneral categories of relief requested by NAACP: specific\nrequirements for HUD in seeking appropriations from Congress; a\ntransfer of authority over the Litigation Vouchers from the BHA\nto the MBHP; and requests for additional HUD funding that are\ncollateral to the transfer of authority to the MBHP.\n37\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 38 of 45\ni.  HUD appropriations\nFirst, NAACP seeks a declaration that HUD must fulfill new\nobligations in its appropriation requests to Congress: to make a\nseparate line-item request for the renewal of Litigation\nVouchers; to specify that the subsidies for the Litigation\nVouchers are court-required; to seek an appropriation for\nrenewing the Litigation Vouchers, regardless of whether all were\nunder lease during any period; and to seek appropriations that\nwould be sufficient to assure that the subsidized housing units\nhave an average of three bedrooms.  (Suppl. Compl. ¶ C.)  \nThis complex remedy is well beyond the scope of the Consent\nDecree, imposing additional, and until now unrequested, burdens\non HUD.  These burdens include seeking further appropriations for\nthe Litigation Voucher program, which indirectly acts as a\nfunding request.  The Consent Decree explicitly states that “no\nadditional funding obligations not explicitly contained in this\nDecree shall be imposed on HUD.”  NAACP's request is plainly a\nrequest to modify these terms of the Consent Decree, and it\ntherefore must be “suitably tailored” to a “significant change in\nRufo\ncircumstances.”   , 502 U.S. at 383.  \nNAACP, however, has not argued or established a change in\ncircumstances that would warrant a modification; the only alleged\nharms are a delay in distributing the Litigation Vouchers, and a\ndistribution to non-eligible families during a discrete period of\n38\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 39 of 45\ntime.  NAACP has failed to demonstrate any relevant ongoing or\nsignificant effects from this conduct.  For example, NAACP\nalleges that the incomplete leasing of Litigation Vouchers during\nthe Snapshot in 2004 resulted in a shortfall of BHA funding for\nthe Vouchers.  NAACP expresses concern that if BHA made up for\nthese shortfalls, it has done so by creating shortfalls for other\nhousing funds.  But shortfalls elsewhere in BHA's allocations are\nbeyond the scope of the Consent Decree, and thus are not\nsignificant for purposes of a modification request.  There is no\ndemonstration that shortfalls exist in the Litigation Voucher\nprogram that is the subject of the Consent Decree.\nFurthermore, even if NAACP had shown a significant change in\ncircumstances, NAACP's requested relief is not “suitably\ntailored” to these alleged harms.  NAACP's preferred remedy--\nrequiring HUD to satisfy new obligations in seeking congressional\nappropriations--bears no readily apparent relation to the\nagencies' former distribution errors.  NAACP requests that HUD be\nrequired to submit line-item appropriations requests, with\nspecial designation given to the Litigation Vouchers.  But NAACP\nhas not provided an account of how future appropriations requests\nwould remedy shortfalls in 2005 and 2006, especially given the\ncomplexities of the congressional appropriations process.\nA similar disjunct between harms and remedies occurs with\nNAACP's request that HUD seek appropriations sufficient to assure\n39\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 40 of 45\nsubsidies for three-bedroom units.  While the Modification\nAgreement does call for subsidies of units having “as an average,\n3 bedrooms of Section 8 family housing” (Modification Agreement\nat 1), NAACP has made no allegation that the BHA has failed to\nprovide three-bedroom units as an average in its administration\nthus far.  This request runs counter to the requirement that a\nmodification to a consent decree do “no more than necessary.” \nKing\n, 149 F.3d at 15. \nii.  Rescission of BHA's awarded vouchers\nNAACP's second set of requests involves removing BHA's\nauthority to administer its assigned Litigation Vouchers.  NAACP\nrequests that HUD rescind the award of four hundred subsidies to\nBHA, and then award these subsidies instead to the DHCD, on the\ncondition that DHCD contract with the MBHP to administer the four\nhundred vouchers in accordance with the Modification Agreement. \n(Suppl. Compl. ¶¶ D.2, D.3.)  NAACP also requests that HUD, BHA,\nand the City provide $295,000 to MBHP to fund housing search\ncounseling services in conjunction with its administration of the\nId. \nfour hundred vouchers.  ( ¶ D.5.)  This is in direct\ncontravention that “no additional funding obligations” be imposed\non HUD.\nAltering the agency responsible for administering the\nLitigation Vouchers plainly qualifies as a major modification to\nthe Consent Decree.  And again, NAACP fails to establish either a\nsignificant change in circumstances or a suitable tailoring\n40\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 41 of 45\nbetween these circumstances and the transfer of vouchers to MBHP. \nThe only basis for the request seems to be that MBHP has\nimplemented its one hundred allotted vouchers with greater speed\nand effectiveness than BHA.  Although NAACP has shown that some\ninstances of tardiness and non-compliance occurred with the\navailability restriction in the ramp up to the deadline for full\naward of Litigation Vouchers, NAACP has not demonstrated that any\nerror in administration is occurring now, or is threatening to\noccur.  Consequently, NAACP has not shown that transferring\nauthority over the vouchers to the MBHP would make any difference\nfor the current or future administration of the Litigation\nVouchers.  Without demonstration by NAACP that BHA is currently\nin noncompliance - or is reasonably likely to be in future\nnoncompliance - with the Consent Decree or Modification\nAgreement, I cannot grant a request for this considerable\nmodification.\niii.  Funding adjustments\nA third set of requests involves funding adjustments related\nto the transfer of Vouchers to the MBHP.  NAACP asks that if the\nLitigation Vouchers transferred to MBHP are insufficient to fund\nthe subsidies at HUD's Fair Market Rent rates, HUD shall provide\nadditional funding from its available resources to correct the\nshortfall.  (Suppl. Compl. ¶ D.3.)  If HUD's resources are\ninsufficient to renew the Litigation Vouchers' funding, NAACP\n41\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 42 of 45\nasks that HUD provide the maximum funding available and use its\nId.\nbest efforts to obtain an appropriation for the shortfall.  (\n¶ D.4.)  These are clearly new funding obligations placed on HUD,\nrequiring an abandonment of the limitation on such obligations\nfound in Part IV.A of the Consent Decree.  Because I have\ndetermined that the transfer of authority to MBHP is not tailored\nto HUD's and BHA's past distribution errors, these related\nRufo\nrequests for additional funding also fail to comply with the \ntailoring requirement.\niv. Lack of fit to the remedy\nRefracting NAACP's allegations of harm through the lens of\nits proposed remedial modification requests confirms that the\nDefendants, though deviating from their formal obligations at\nparticular times, have not committed a material breach of the\nConsent Decree.  Even if NAACP had demonstrated such a breach, it\nwould not be entitled to relief because none of its requested\nremedies are tailored to its allegations of harm.\ne. Conclusion\nIn sum, as to each of the counts in the Supplemental\nComplaint, I will deny NAACP's motion for summary judgment, I\nwill grant the BHA's and the City’s motions for summary judgment\non the Supplemental Complaint.  I will grant summary judgment to\n  \nHUD sua sponte. Although HUD has not moved for summary judgment,\nthe two requirements for entering summary judgment sua sponte\nhave been satisfied.  First, discovery on the Supplemental\n42\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 43 of 45\nComplaint has permitted the parties to “glean the material\nBerkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.\nfacts.”   , 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st\nCir. 1996).  Second, NAACP has had “a chance to present its\nevidence on the essential elements of the claim” through\ndiscussion in its own motion for summary judgment and in its\nresponses to the City's and BHA's motions for summary judgment. \nId.\n4. BHA’s Motion for Summary Judgment on its Counterclaim\nBHA has moved for summary judgment on its remaining\ncounterclaim against NAACP: that NAACP breached the Modification\nAgreement in failing to follow the dispute resolution procedures\ntherein.  The Original Consent Decree contains language unchanged\nin the Modified Consent Decree requiring that “prior to\nsubmission of any dispute under this Decree to the court, counsel\nfor the parties shall consult in an effort to resolve the matter\ninformally.”  BHA argues that NAACP failed to initiate\ndiscussions, solicit responses, and schedule meetings to discuss\nthe progress of satisfying the Modified Consent Decree's\nobjectives.  \nAs NAACP notes, however, the record demonstrates NAACP\ncontacted BHA numerous times regarding its concerns.  In\naddition, NAACP argues that BHA withheld information on the\ndiversion of the Litigation Vouchers, preventing NAACP from\nutilizing the informal mechanisms to resolve its concerns.  This\n43\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 44 of 45\ncasts considerable doubt on whether BHA itself engaged in\nmeaningful efforts to resolve the matter informally, as required\nby the Consent Decree.  In these circumstances, BHA cannot\ndemonstrate as a matter of law that NAACP failed to comply with\nthe Consent Decree's consultation obligations.  The Decree's\nlanguage that the parties “shall consult in an effort to resolve\nthe matter informally” is quite open-textured, and on my reading\nof the language and the record before me, NAACP satisfied its\nconsultation requirement as a matter of law.  The pre-litigation\ndevelopment as to efforts at consultation is sufficient to\njustify summary judgment for NAACP as to BHA's counterclaim.  I\nwill deny BHA's motion for summary judgment as to its\ncounterclaim, and grant summary judgment to NAACP sua sponte. \nBerkovitz,\n 89 F.3d at 29.\nIII. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated more fully above, I DENY HUD’s Motion\nfor Judgment on the Pleadings or, in the alternative, suggestion\nto the Court that it lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction (Docket\nNo. 120); I DENY the City’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\nbut GRANT its Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 122); I\nDENY NAACP’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of its claims\nagainst all Defendants (Docket No. 124); I GRANT BHA's Motion for\nSummary Judgment as to NAACP’s Supplemental Complaint, but DENY\nBHA’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to its Counterclaim against\n44\n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 158   Filed 03/17/09   Page 45 of 45\nNAACP (Docket No. 127).  Correspondingly, I GRANT summary\njudgment sua sponte to HUD as to NAACP’s Supplemental Complaint,\nand to NAACP as to BHA’s Counterclaim. \nDouglas P. Woodlock \n/s/        \nDOUGLAS P.

      "text": "624 F.Supp. 1083 (1985)\nNAACP, BOSTON CHAPTER, Plaintiff,\nv.\nSamuel R. PIERCE, Jr., Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, et al., Defendants.\nCiv. A. No. 78-850-S.\nUnited States District Court, D. Massachusetts.\nDecember 31, 1985.\n1084 *1084 Edward Barhsak, Sugarman, Rogers, Barshak & Cohen, Boston, Mass., Michael Sussman, NAACP\nSpecial Contr. Fund, Brooklyn, N.Y., for plaintiff.\nAnthony J. Ciccone, HUD, Washington, D.C., Melissa Jad, Stephen Kaye, City of Boston Law Dept., Richard\nWelch, III, Asst. U.S. Atty., Kathy Machan, HUD, Boston, Mass., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON FEDERAL DEFENDANTS' MOTION\nTO DISMISS FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION\nSKINNER, District Judge.\nIn this action plaintiff, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Boston Chapter\n(\"NAACP\"), claimed that the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the local\nadministrators of the Department (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"HUD\") had failed to take measures\nmandated by various statutes and the Constitution of the United States to prevent racial discrimination and\npromote fair housing in the administration of federal grants to the City of Boston (\"the City\"). I made findings and\nconclusions of fact and rulings of law after a trial on the merits of plaintiff's claims against HUD. 567 F.Supp. 637\n(D.Mass.1983). All findings, conclusions and rulings contained therein are hereby incorporated and restated\nherein.\nIn summary, I concluded that HUD itself did not intentionally discriminate in administering its programs and that\nthe evidence did not warrant a finding that HUD financed City programs that were either intentionally\ndiscriminatory or had a discriminatory impact. Consequently, I found no violations of § 109 of Title I of the\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. § 5309), § 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d) or the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\nHowever, I did find that HUD was violating its own regulations by failing to condition receipt by the City of CDBG\nfunds on preparation of a Community Development and Housing Plan identifying the \"special needs\" of the lower\nincome population. 24 C.F.R. § 570.300(b). This failure was found seriously to impede HUD in carrying out its\nstatutory mandate under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.) (\"Title VIII\" or the \"Fair\n1085 Housing Act\") to promote fair housing in *1085 all federally financed projects. This issue is no longer in the case,\nhowever, because the City did submit to HUD a 180-page minority needs assessment on September 7, 1982,\nand HUD is no longer in violation of its own regulations.\nI found that HUD's mandate under Title VIII, to \"administer the programs and activities relating to housing and\nurban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of this subchapter\", 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d)(5),\nrequires effective fair housing enforcement. Shannon v. HUD, 436 F.2d 809 (3rd Cir.1970); Garrett v. City of\nHamtramck, 503 F.2d 1236 (6th Cir.1974). I found that HUD did not satisfy the minimum levels of compliance\nrequired by this section in two respects. First, it had not required the City to establish an effective fair housing\nenforcement program in the face of knowledge of pervasive racial discrimination in the City. Second, HUD had\nknowledge that there was and is a housing emergency in the City of Boston which had a disproportionate impact\n\non low income black families and nevertheless did not condition its UDAG grants on the construction of low\nincome housing.\nI noted in the opinion that it was \"extremely difficult to quantify HUD legal obligations\" under these statutes. The\nnature of these legal obligations is being challenged in this motion. HUD requests the court to dismiss this action\nfor lack of jurisdiction. Based on the violations found, HUD argues that: (1) HUD has cured its violation of its own\nregulations because the City has submitted a Community Development Housing Plan; (2) plaintiff has eschewed\nreliance on the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") as a basis for judicial review of HUD's actions; (3) sovereign\nimmunity bars plaintiff's suit; and (4) plaintiff has no right of action against HUD under Title VIII.\nA. RIGHT OF ACTION OTHER THAN UNDER THE APA\n1. Lack of Jurisdiction.\nIt is well settled that no action will lie against an agency of the United States unless sovereign immunity has been\nwaived either expressly or by clear implication. Absence of waiver goes to the subject matter jurisdiction of the\ncourt and may be raised at any time by a party or by the court. United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586, 61\nS.Ct. 767, 769, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941); see generally Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure:\nJurisdiction 2d § 3654-5. The only surviving claim in the present action is one under Title VIII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d), which does not contain an express waiver of sovereign immunity. The\ndefendants correctly state that the waivers of sovereign immunity found in 42 U.S.C. § 1404a and 12 U.S.C. §\n1702 do not apply to this case. The analysis found in the numerous cases cited by the defendants would lead to\nthe conclusion that sovereign immunity has not been waived. The defendants' memorandum fails to account for\nthe Supreme Court's opinion in Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 301-06, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 1548-50, 47 L.Ed.2d 792\n(1976), however.\nIn Hills v. Gautreaux, the Supreme Court ruled that the district court had the authority to require HUD to carry out\nthe duties mandated by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. 425\nU.S. at 301-06, 96 S.Ct. at 1548-50. The district court had originally granted HUD's motion to dismiss for lack of\njurisdiction. 425 U.S. at 289, 96 S.Ct. at 1542. The court of appeals reversed. The Supreme Court affirmed the\njudgment of the court of appeals without discussion of jurisdiction or waiver of sovereign immunity.\nThe opinion contains neither analysis nor discussion of subject matter jurisdiction or sovereign immunity. The\nissue of subject matter jurisdiction had been raised in the case, however, and could hardly have been ignored.\nThe case must stand for the proposition that subject matter jurisdiction exists in the federal courts to require HUD\n1086 to carry out the mandates of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VIII of *1086 the Civil Rights Act of\n1968, specifically 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d), even though no analytical basis for the exercise of jurisdiction is apparent\nin the opinion. It is true, of course, that in Hills v. Gautreaux the Court found that HUD itself had participated in a\ndiscriminatory housing program. The significance of that fact, however, was that it provided a basis for a remedy\ncutting across municipal lines, distinguishing that case from Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41\nL.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). 425 U.S. at 297, 96 S.Ct. at 1546. It would seem to have no bearing on the issue of\nwhether sovereign immunity is waived for claims against HUD under Title VI and Title VIII.\nIn summary, there has been no explicit waiver of sovereign immunity by Congress which would govern this case.\nThe application of traditional analysis would lead to the conclusion that there had been no waiver of sovereign\nimmunity and hence no subject matter jurisdiction. Hills v. Gautreaux, however, implicitly holds that jurisdiction\nexists to require HUD to carry out the mandate of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, even though no\nanalytical basis for the exercise of jurisdiction appears in the opinion. Accordingly, insofar as the defendants'\nmotion seeks dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it is denied.\n\n2. Implied Right of Action Under Title VIII.\nHUD argues that plaintiff may not maintain this action because there is no implied private right of action under\nTitle VIII. As discussed above, I found that HUD had not fulfilled its duty to \"administer the programs and activities\nrelating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of this subchapter\". 42\nU.S.C. § 3608(d)(5). The question is whether private relief against HUD is available for violations of this section.\nBoth parties agree that there is no express statutory private right of action against HUD.\nA challenge to the existence of a private right of action, unlike the issue of sovereign immunity, does not implicate\nsubject matter jurisdiction but challenges the existence of a claim upon which relief may be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P.\n12(b)(6). The same issues also may be reviewed at the close of the evidence by a motion under Fed.R. Civ.P. 12\n(h)(2). The defendants raise it now after I have already made findings of fact on the issue of liability, when the\nonly issue remaining is whether the court should order injunctive relief, or alternately appoint a special master for\nthe purpose of fashioning appropriate injunctive relief. Accordingly, I shall treat this motion as being limited to the\ncontext in which it is raised and consider only the narrow issue of whether there is an implicit private right of\naction under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d)(5) to secure injunctive relief.\nPlaintiff first asserts that the court of appeals decision on the standing issues in this suit constitutes approval of its\ntheory that a private right of action under Title VIII exists because the opinion does not tie the decision on the\nstanding of the parties to the APA. See N.A.A.C.P. Boston Chapter v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514, 517 n. 4, 519 (1st\nCir.1979). That decision involved the standing of particular parties to contest UDAG grants on a number of\ndifferent grounds. The issue of a private right of action under Title VIII was not presented to or considered by the\n[1]\ncourt nor was resolution of this issue necessary to its decision.  The court of appeals has often reminded us not\nto read into its opinions views on issues not expressly placed before it.\nThe cases which plaintiff asserts assume a private right of action under Title VIII primarily concern the situation in\nwhich local or state entities have taken discriminatory actions in violation of the Constitution, which is not the\ncase here. The cases indicate only that HUD might be held liable where it is aware of a grantee's discriminatory\n1087 practices and makes no effort to force *1087 the grantee into compliance by terminating funding. Anderson v. City\nof Alpharetta, Ga., 737 F.2d 1530, 1536-37 (11th Cir.1984); see, e.g., Garrett v. City of Hamtramck, 503 F.2d\n1236, 1247 (6th Cir.1974); Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 425 F.Supp. 987, 1021 (E.D.Pa.1976) (noting HUD's\nduty to further construction), aff'd,564 F.2d 126 (3d Cir.1977),cert. denied sub nom. Whitman Area Improv.\nCouncil v. Resident Advisory Bd., 435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1457, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978); but see Otero v. New York\nCity Housing Authority, 354 F.Supp. 941, 957 & n. 18 (S.D.N.Y.) (dismissing claims against HUD), rev'd on other\ngrounds,484 F.2d 1122 (2d Cir.1973); Crow v. Brown, 332 F.Supp. 382, 395 (N.D. Ga.1971) (not granting relief\nagainst HUD), aff'd,457 F.2d 788 (5th Cir.1972).\nThe leading case of Shannon v. United States Dep. of Housing and Urban Dev., 436 F.2d 809 (3rd Cir.1970),\npermitted a private right of action against HUD. Whether this was an implied right of action under Title VIII or\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., is not strictly clear. Although the opinion\nin general speaks of relevant factors under the APA, it appears to authorize relief which would go beyond that\nauthorized by the APA. Other courts have concluded that review of the Secretary's decisions under Title VIII is\navailable only under the APA. E.g., Alschuler v. Dept. of Housing & Urban Development, 686 F.2d 472, 481 (7th\nCir.1982); Little Earth of United Tribes v. U.S. Dept. of Housing, 584 F.Supp. 1292, 1296 (D.Minn. 1983); King v.\nHarris, 464 F.Supp. 827, 836-37 (E.D.N.Y.) aff'd w/o op.,636 F.2d 1202 (2d Cir.1980); see Clients Council v.\nPierce, 711 F.2d 1406, 1425 (8th Cir.1983) (citing Alschuler).\nIn any case, since 1975, federal courts have not been free to assume an implied private right of action under\nfederal statutes or to indulge in the ambiguity of the Shannon opinion. In Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080,\n45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), the Supreme Court stated that the existence of an implied private right of action must be\ndetermined in accordance with the following test:\nIn determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one,\nseveral factors are relevant. First, is the plaintiff \"one of the class for whose especial benefit the\n\nstatute was enacted,\" that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff?\nSecond, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a\nremedy or to deny one? Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative\nscheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally\nrelegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be\ninappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?\n422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2088 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).\nIn Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), the Court made it clear\nthat \"before concluding that Congress intended to make a remedy available to a special class of litigants, a court\nmust carefully analyze the four factors that Cort identifies as indicative of such an intent\". Id.441 U.S. at 688, 99\nS.Ct. at 1953. The focus of the analysis must be on the intent of Congress. See, e.g., Transamerica Mortgage\nAdvisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 23-24, 100 S.Ct. 242, 249, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979).\nThe first factor under Cort is whether the statute was enacted for the benefit of a special class of which plaintiff is\na member. Section 3608(d)(5) does not identify the class, if any, which Congress intended to benefit; instead, the\nstatute places an affirmative duty on the Secretary without reference to any beneficiaries. The Supreme Court\nnoted the importance of this distinction in Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690-93, 99 S.Ct. at 1954-56:\nThere would be far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons if Congress,\n1088 instead of drafting Title IX with an unmistakable focus on the *1088 benefited class, had written it\nsimply as a ban on discriminatory conduct by recipients of federal funds or as a prohibition against\nthe disbursement of public funds to educational institutions engaged in discriminatory conduct.\nThe Court contrasted Title IX's focus on the benefited class with rejected language which would have made the\nanti-discrimination aspect of Title IX \"a simple directive to the Secretary of HEW\". Id. at 693 n. 14, 99 S.Ct. at\n1955-56 n. 14. While the affirmative duty imposed on the Secretary by § 3608(d)(5) may be more than a \"simple\ndirective\", it is a duty imposed by language which does not specifically indicate any special class of intended\nbeneficiaries. The fact that \"the whole community\" is the victim of discriminatory housing practices does not help\nplaintiff. See Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins., 409 U.S. 205, 211, 93 S.Ct. 364, 367-68, 34 L.Ed.2d 415\n(1972), quoting 114 Cong.Rec. 2706 (remarks of Senator Javits). Of course, it is not a very great leap to\nconclude that by pressing for fair housing Congress intended to benefit the victims of discriminatory housing, low\nincome minorities, i.e., the very constituency which gives the plaintiff its standing in this action. Nevertheless, the\nunfocused cast of the language in § 3608(d)(5) is sufficiently different from that construed in Cannon to\ndistinguish this case and lead to the conclusion that Congress intended only a very general admonition to HUD\nand not the creation of a private right of action.\nThe second of the factors identified in Cort, whether there is any indication of legislative intent to create a remedy\nor to deny one, has assumed increasing importance over the years. \"Unless this congressional intent can be\ninferred from the language of the statute, the statutory structure, or some other source, the essential predicate for\nimplication of a private remedy simply does not exist.\" Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U.S. 77,\n94, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 1582, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981). The language of § 3608(d)(5) is silent on the issue. Because\nTitle VIII was offered as a floor amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1968 by Senators Mondale and Brooke,\nneither the House nor Senate Reports contain any explicit discussion of Title VIII. See H.R.Rep. No. 473, 90th\nCong., 1st Sess.; S.Rep. No. 721, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), reprinted in 1968 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News\n1837.\nReview of the Congressional Record reveals only that the sponsors of the Fair Housing Act sought to require\nfederal housing administrators to consider the impact of their funding decisions upon the racial composition of\naffected areas. See 114 Cong.Rec. 2278 (1968) (remarks of Senator Mondale); id. at 2281 (remarks of Senator\nBrooke); see also Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 737 F.2d at 1535; Otero v. New York City Housing\nAuthority, 484 F.2d 1122, 1133-34 (2d Cir.1973). The cited passages indicate that Senators Mondale and Brooke\nwere concerned that the United States government was a covert \"collaborator\" in discrimination or \"sanctioned\"\ndiscrimination in housing. The purpose of § 3608(d)(5) was to correct this situation. The Congressional Record\nprovides no evidence of an intent to allow private actions against HUD.\n\nThe only evidence of congressional intent concerning the issue of private suits to review HUD's actions under\nTitle VIII is contained in \"questions and answers describing the fair housing amendment\" which were ordered to\nbe printed in the Congressional Record at the request of Senator Mondale:\nWill persons who disagree with the Department of Housing and Urban Development's\ninterpretation of the Act have any recourse?\nAll orders of the Department will be subject to review by the Federal courts. In addition, the\nDepartment will be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act in all its\noperations under the Fair Housing Act.\n114 Cong.Rec. 2273 (emphasis added). The orders referred to in this answer are the cease and desist orders\n1089 and temporary restraining orders the Secretary was empowered to issue under the original enforcement *1089\nprovisions of the Fair Housing Act as submitted by Senators Mondale and Brooke. See 114 Cong.Rec. 2271.\nThese provisions were later deleted. The bill's Senate sponsors, and by implication Congress, intended HUD's\noperations under Title VIII to be reviewed under the APA where applicable. No broader intention can be inferred\nfrom this language.\nAnalysis of the statutory scheme is equally unproductive. Title VIII makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale,\nrental, financing or brokerage of housing. 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604-3606. The statute sets out two methods by which a\nperson aggrieved by discriminatory housing practices may seek to enforce these provisions. Under 42 U.S.C. §\n3610(a)-(c), the aggrieved person may file a complaint with the Secretary. The Secretary will investigate and\nattempt to resolve the matter or refer it to a state or local fair housing agency. The complainant may file a civil suit\nif voluntary compliance is not obtained within thirty days. § 3610(d). The section only provides for suit \"against the\nrespondent named in the complaint\", a category which would not include HUD.\nAlternatively, under 42 U.S.C. § 3612, a private person may file a civil action in federal district court to enforce\nrights against discrimination in the sale, rental, financing or brokerage of housing granted by §§ 3603, 3604, 3605\nand 3606. The absence of § 3608 from this list of sections providing the basis for a civil action suggests that\nCongress did not intend a private right of action against HUD under § 3608. Title VIII also provides that the\nAttorney General may bring suit to challenge a \"pattern or practice\" of discrimination. § 3613. In view of the\nexpress provisions for private and governmental enforcement of the duties imposed on both the public and local\nor state governments by §§ 3603-3606, it is unlikely that \"Congress absentmindedly forgot to mention an\nintended private action\". See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. at 20, 100 S.Ct. at 247,\nquoting Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. at 742, 99 S.Ct. at 1981 (Powell, J., dissenting).\nI conclude that there is no evidence in the statutory scheme of a congressional intent to provide a private right of\naction against HUD under Title VIII. Indeed, such evidence as there is strongly suggests that Congress did not\nintend to create such a right of action.\nThe third factor identified in Cort is whether the existence of a private right of action is consistent with the\nunderlying purposes of the legislative scheme. I suppose that private rights of action are consistent in one sense\nin that they necessarily provide yet another layer of enforcement. On the other hand, Senator Mondale's\nsummary of the proposed fair housing amendment states that \"Responsibility for administration and enforcement\nwould rest with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\". In Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 737\nF.2d 1530, the court held that there was no private right of action to enforce HUD's generalized affirmative duty\nunder § 3608(d)(5). By way of dicta, the court said that HUD could be held liable under § 3608(d)(5) when HUD\nhad taken discriminatory action itself and when it knew of discriminatory action by a client agency and made no\neffort to enforce compliance with the Fair Housing Act by cutting off federal financing, citing Client's Council v.\nPierce, 711 F.2d 1406 at 1422-3. It is not clear, however, whether the court in Anderson or the court in Client's\nCouncil is referring to a private right of action implicit in Title VIII or action under the APA for abuse of discretion,\ndiscussed hereinafter. The facts in this case relieve me from the necessity of deciding whether HUD would be\nliable in the situations suggested by this dictum. However, the holding of Anderson appears to be squarely on\npoint. I conclude that an implied private right of action under 3608(d)(5) is not consistent with the purpose of the\nAct to place responsibility for enforcement squarely on the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n1090\n\n*1090 This conclusion is consistent with Hills v. Gautreaux, supra, and my ruling on subject matter jurisdiction.\nThe Court in Hills v. Gautreaux did not explicitly consider the issue of whether there was an implied right of action\nagainst HUD under Title VIII. Furthermore, a determination of the issue is not necessarily implicit in the judgment\nbecause it was not essential thereto. The existence of a private right of action goes to the sufficiency of the\ncomplaint to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, not to subject matter jurisdiction, and the issue is\ngenerally waived if not timely presented. The issue apparently was never presented in Hills v. Gautreaux.\nB. REVIEWABILITY UNDER THE APA\nThe parties agree that if the APA is applicable, it supplies both the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity and a\nstatutory private right of action.\nAs a preliminary matter, HUD argues that plaintiff has rejected reliance on the APA as the basis for this court's\npower to review HUD's actions. Quoting a section of plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of its Proposed Form of\nJudgment and in Opposition to Defendant's Form of Judgment in which plaintiff states \"NAACP has never\ngrounded this action on the APA\", HUD contends that plaintiff cannot now rely on the APA and the court should\ntherefore dismiss the action. Plaintiff responds that it has not waived the APA as a basis for its claim that HUD\nviolated Title VIII and that its failure to cite the APA in its complaint can have no effect on the court's ability to\nreview HUD's actions.\nIf relief is in fact available under the APA there would be no problem in amending the complaint or deeming it\namended for present purposes. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15. State Highway Commission of Missouri v. Volpe, 479 F.2d 1099,\n1105 (8th Cir.1973) (quoting Sikora v. Brenner, 379 F.2d 134, 136 (D.C.Cir.1967)); see also Angleton v. Pierce,\n574 F.Supp. 719, 728 (D.N.J.1983)aff'd w/o op.,734 F.2d 3 (3rd Cir.1984),cert. denied___ U.S. ___, 105 S.Ct.\n245, 83 L.Ed.2d 183 (1984).\nTreating the complaint as so amended, I must next consider the reviewability of HUD's violation of Title VIII under\nthe APA. HUD argues that the court can only proscribe specific agency actions found to be \"an abuse of\ndiscretion\", citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Plaintiff argues that the court must \"compel agency action unlawfully\nwithheld or unreasonably delayed\", citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(1).\nThere is a threshold question of applicability of the APA which the parties have not argued, however. Section 701\n(a) of 5 U.S.C. provides that:\n(a) This chapter applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that\n(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or\n(2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\nTitle VIII's affirmative duty provision, § 3608(d)(5), does not explicitly preclude judicial review. Is HUD's level of\nactivity under § 3608(d)(5) \"committed to agency discretion by law\"?\nThe Supreme Court has narrowly interpreted this exception to judicial review under the APA. In Citizens to\nPreserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), the Court\nstated that the exception applies only \"in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that\nin a given case there is no law to apply\".\nPrior to the Supreme Court's decision in Overton Park, our court of appeals had developed an analytical\nframework for determining whether an agency action is committed to agency discretion by law. In Hahn v.\nGottlieb, 430 F.2d 1243 (1st Cir. 1970), the court considered whether tenants in housing subsidized under the\nNational Housing Act had a right to review under the APA of the Federal Housing Administration's decision to\n1091 grant rent increases. The court approached the issue recognizing \"a strong presumption in favor of review, *1091\nwhich is overcome only by `clear and convincing evidence' that Congress intended to cut off review above the\nagency level\", which may be identified by the following criteria:\n\n[E]vidence may ... be drawn not only from explicit language, but also from a statute's purpose and\ndesign.... In the absence of a clear declaration of congressional intent, three factors seem to us\ndeterminative: first, the appropriateness of the issues raised for review by the courts; second, the\nneed for judicial supervision to safeguard the interests of the plaintiffs; and third, the impact of\nreview on the effectiveness of the agency in carrying out its assigned role.\nId at 1249. (citations omitted). Applying these guidelines to the facts in Hahn, the court concluded that the broad\nstatutory grant of authority to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the National Housing Act\nsignified that Congress intended the agency's actions pursuant to this authority to be \"committed to agency\ndiscretion\" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).\nOur court of appeals has recognized that the Supreme Court's decision in Overton Park limited the exception for\nmatters \"committed to agency discretion\". Adams Nursing Home, Inc. v. Mathews, 548 F.2d 1077, 1079 n. 5 (1st\nCir.1977). However, the court of appeals and other courts continue to cite Hahn and to employ its analytical\nframework when considering the exception. See, e.g., Dugan v. Ramsay, 727 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir.1984); \nMunoz-Mendoza v. Pierce, 711 F.2d 421, 430 (1st Cir.1983); Colon v. Carter, 633 F.2d 964, 966-67 (1st Cir.1980);\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. S.E.C., 606 F.2d 1031, 1043-44 (D.C.Cir.1979); S.G.A. Financial\nCorp. v. United States Small Business Administration, 509 F.Supp. 392, 398 (D.N.J.1981).\nIn one of the above cited cases, the court of appeals raised the issue of whether agency actions very similar to\nthose requested by plaintiff in the instant case are committed to agency discretion under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). In \nMunoz-Mendoza, supra, minority residents of Boston brought suit seeking judicial review of HUD's decision to\ngrant $19 million to the City for the development of the Copley Place commercial complex. The court's opinion\ndealt principally with the standing of various plaintiffs in the action. The case was remanded to the district court\nfor further proceedings. The court took the opportunity to offer the parties and the district court guidance on\nseveral of the outstanding issues, however. The court stated that the case \"in essence is a challenge to federal\nadministrative action of the sort typically governed by the Administrative Procedure Act\". Id. at 429. The court\nconcluded that the case presented several difficult issues, one of which was that plaintiffs, on remand,\nmust ... show that Congress intended the courts, at the risk of interrupting or seriously delaying\nmulti-million dollar projects aimed at helping distressed areas, to review agency \"study\" decisions \nof the sort at issue here in order to correct the type of abuse of discretion that the plaintiffs here\nallege. See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Hahn v. Gottlieb, 430 F.2d 1243 (1st Cir.1970).\nId. at 430 (emphasis in original).\nAlthough the quoted language is dictum, the court not only reaffirmed the vitality of Hahn, but also suggested that\nthe Hahn analysis is appropriately employed in considering judicial reviewability of HUD's actions in administering\nfederal grant programs.\nAccordingly, I turn to the Hahn analytical framework in an attempt to determine whether agency action to carry\nout HUD's affirmative duty to promote fair housing under 42 U.S.C. 3608(d)(5) is \"committed to agency\ndiscretion\" under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).\nI note initially that Congress has not explicitly evidenced in the Fair Housing Act an intent to cut off review of\n1092 HUD's actions under § 3608(d)(5) above the agency level. Since there is no declaration of *1092 congressional\nintent a consideration of the three \"determinative factors\" is necessary.\n1. Appropriateness of Issues for Judicial Review.\nIn considering whether the issues in the Hahn case were appropriate for judicial review, the court of appeals\nbegan by noting that the courts are \"ill-equipped to superintend economic and managerial issues\" of the kind at\nissue in that case. 430 F.2d at 1249. The court implied that cases which can be resolved by \"judicial application\nof canons of statutory construction\" are appropriate for judicial review. Id., (citing Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159,\n\n90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970)). This standard is similar to the Supreme Court's declaration that the\nexception to judicial review applies only when in \"a given case there is no law to apply\". 401 U.S. at 410.\nApplying these standards to this case, I conclude that a review of HUD's failure affirmatively to promote fair\nhousing would require the kind of supervision over economic and managerial issues that the court of appeals in \nHahn suggested the courts are ill-equipped to perform. This is particularly true where I have found the deficiency\nto consist of failure to promote the construction of sufficient additional low-income housing to make enforcement\nof fair housing practicable. Whether the choice is publicly financed housing, or one of an infinite range of public-\nprivate financial partnerships or private financing plus rent subsidies, successful low-income housing is the result\nof the careful resolution of many fluid and dynamic factors: economics, demography, neighborhood support,\nethnic cohesiveness and, last but no means least, local politics. One need not be a social historian to recognize\nthat much well-intentioned public housing has proven disastrous. The public, and the plaintiff's constituents are\nbest served when the housing program is well-researched, well-staffed and well-managed on a daily basis. This a\ncourt cannot do. It cannot frame an order to HUD with sufficient specificity to be effectively enforced. It can do\nlittle more than admonish the agency in general terms to comply with the statute.\nThe plaintiff has suggested that these problems can be solved by the appointment of a special master. This has\nindeed been successful where there is a discrete managerial problem, such as the supervision of the Rhode\nIsland state pentitentiary at Howard, or the receivership of the Boston Housing Authority. Special masters have\nbeen of assistance to courts in attacking a specific evil, such as school desegregation. In this amorphous\nsituation, however, the master still must approach the problem from but one point of view, without the benefit of\nexpert staffing. Adversary advocacy is not likely to be an adequate substitute. The court should not set up a\nsuper-HUD to monitor HUD.\nI note with interest that within the last two weeks two of the housing projects most urgently espoused by the\nplaintiff, Tent City and Columbia Point, have received the necessary financing through the political interaction of\nHUD, the City and housing financing agencies of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The laying on of the\ncourt's heavy hand was neither necessary nor desirable.\nI conclude that application of the first test under Hahn weighs heavily against judicial review.\n2. Need for Review to Safeguard Plaintiff's Interests.\nPlaintiff's interests in fair housing are of the highest order. As in Hahn, the constituents plaintiff represents have\nlimited choices and generally weak bargaining power. Id. at 1250. Plaintiff has an interest in insuring that there is\nan adequate supply of desegregated housing to give minority families a true choice. Plaintiff should be able to\nexpect that HUD will heed the congressional order in Title VIII to act affirmatively to promote integrated housing,\nbut if HUD fails there is indeed a need for review. This aspect of the analysis weighs in favor of review.\n1093  3. Impact of Review on Agency Effectiveness.\n*1093\nJudicial review of the day-to-day operations of large institutional bureaucracies has occasionally been highly\nsuccessful, as noted above. However, a judicial determination of what HUD is required to do affirmatively to\nfurther fair housing policy would involve many of the same \"essentially managerial decisions\" that were required\nin Hahn. Id. There, the court of appeals felt that the values of informality and flexibility would be impinged upon by\njudicial review. Id.\nIn this case judicial review would impinge even more fundamentally on agency decision-making processes. For\nessentially the same reason I have mentioned under the rubric of appropriateness virtually every aspect of the\nagency's research and negotiation would be subject to judicial monitoring, a condition likely to reduce the\nefficiency of the agency to near zero.\nIn summary, the inappropriateness of judicial review of the issues in this case, and the likely negative impact on\nthe effectiveness of the agency's operations outweigh the admittedly substantial need to safeguard plaintiff's\ninterests in fair housing. In light of this balance, and the Supreme Court's characterization of the exception for\n\nmatters \"committed to agency discretion\" as applicable to situations in which \"there is no law to apply\", 401 U.S.\nat 410, I conclude that HUD's actions under § 3608(d)(5) are excepted from judicial review.\nOne final issue remains. The court of appeals has recently indicated that even if agency action is \"committed to\nagency discretion\" the federal courts have power to review for abuses of discretion. Cruz v. Brock, Secretary of\nLabor of the United States, 778 F.2d 62, at 63 (1st Cir.1985) (citing K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise § 28.7\n(1984)). I conclude that my prior findings preclude review for abuse of discretion. Review for \"abuse of discretion\"\nunder the APA standard is only possible when specific agency actions are challenged. 737 F.2d at 1534. As in \nAnderson, supra, I did not find that HUD acted wrongly with respect to any particular decision it made, but instead\nthat HUD generally failed to act affirmatively to promote fair housing.\nIn summary, the only statutory violation HUD committed which has not been cured was of Title VIII, a statute\nunder which there is no private right of action against HUD. The violated statutory provision requires HUD to take\nactions that are committed to agency discretion by law under the APA.\nORDER FOR JUDGMENT\nI conclude that (1) the plaintiff has no implicit private right of action under 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d)(5), and (2) that\nreview under the APA is not available to redress HUD's failure to take affirmative action to promote fair housing\nunder § 3608(d)(5). The defendant HUD's motion to dismiss is ALLOWED. I order judgment of dismissal to be\nentered forthwith.\n[1] In contrast to the issue of subject matter jurisdiction in Hills v.

Plaintiff National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n(“NAACP”) is a non-profit membership corporation organized and incorporated under \nthe laws of the State of New York.   Its National Headquarters is located at 4805 Mount \nHope Drive, Baltimore, Maryland, and its Boston Branch office is located at The Mall of \nRoxbury, 330 Martin Luther King Boulevard, Boston, Massachusetts.  Plaintiff NAACP \nis dedicated to improving the legal, educational, political and social status of Black \npersons in the United States, including the Boston metropolitan area.   \n2.  Defendant Alphonso Jackson is the Secretary of HUD and has his \nprincipal office in Washington, D.C.  He is statutorily charged with the administration of \nall programs funded by HUD.  Defendant Jackson is sued in his official capacity. \n3.  Defendant City of Boston (“the City”) is a geographical and political \nsubdivision of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and exists as a charter city organized \npursuant to the laws of Massachusetts.  Its offices are located at One City Hall Plaza, \nBoston, Massachusetts.  \n4.  Defendant Boston Housing Authority (“BHA”) is a public agency that \nprovides subsidized housing to low and moderate income individuals and families.  It was \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 3 of 16\nestablished in 1935 by the Mayor and City Council of Boston in accordance with the \nprovisions of M.G.L., c. 121B.  It is managed and controlled by an administrator who is \nappointed by and serves at the pleasure of the Mayor.  The BHA receives federal \nassistance to administer rental assistance programs such as the federal Section 8 voucher \nprogram.  The BHA is located at 52 Chauncy Street, Boston, Massachusetts.    \nJurisdiction and Venue \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims against HUD pursuant to the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. and the Consent Decree entered in \nthe original action, as modified on February 8, 2000 by an Agreement Among the \nN.A.A.C.P., Boston Chapter, The U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nand The City of Boston and The Boston Housing Authority (“Modification Agreement”).  \nA copy of the Consent Decree is attached as Exhibit A.   A Copy of the Modification \nAgreement is attached as Exhibit B. \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims against the City and the BHA \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) in that the claims are so related to the claims against \nHUD that they form part of the same case or controversy. \n7.  Venue of this action is in the District of Massachusetts pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391 (b) and (e), this being the district in which a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claims occurred. \n8.  Plaintiff’s prayer for declaratory and injunctive relief is brought pursuant \nto 28 U.S. C. § 2201 and 2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 4 of 16\nFacts Common to All Counts \nThe Consent Decree and the Modification Agreement \n9.  The Consent Decree in the underlying action required, among other things, \nthat HUD “provide subsidies for 500 units having, as an average 3 bedrooms, of Section \n8 family housing  … in addition to what any public housing agency operating in Boston \nmay receive under a fair share allocation.”  Of the 500 units, 300 were to be funded \nthrough project-based subsidies, and 200 through tenant-based certificates or vouchers.   \n10.  HUD awarded the subsidies for 400 units, comprising the 300 project-\nbased units and 100 of the 200 tenant-based units, to the BHA.   \n11.  HUD awarded the other 100 tenant-based units to the Massachusetts \nDepartment of Housing and Community Development (“DHCD”), which in turn \ncontracted out their administration to the Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership \n(“MBHP”).      \n12.  In late 1999, NAACP, HUD, the BHA, and the City resolved a long-\nstanding disagreement as to the proper use of the above-described subsidies and \nmemorialized the resolution in the Modification Agreement. \n13.  By its terms, the Modification Agreement required that the Consent \nDecree be modified in certain respects and provided that the Modification Agreement \nwould not become effective unless and until the Court granted a joint motion to modify \nthe Consent Decree.  That motion was granted on  February 8, 2000.  A copy of the \nmotion is attached as Exhibit C, and a copy of the Court’s ruling is attached as Exhibit D. \n14.  The Modification Agreement acknowledged that     \nthe purpose of the 500 units of housing created by these \nSection 8 subsidies is to increase the number of affordable \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 5 of 16\ndesegregated housing opportunities available to minority \nfamilies in order to remedy HUD’s failure, as found by \n[this Court]… affirmatively to further fair housing in  the \nCity in that the Court found  that [among other things], \ndespite HUD’s  knowledge that a housing emergency \nexisted which  had a disproportionate impact on low \nincome black families, HUD did not … finance the increase \nof desegregated housing stock to give minority families \nmeaningful choice of location. \n \n15.  The Modification Agreement, and the Consent Decree as modified, \nrequired that the project-based subsidies be converted into tenant-based subsidies, thus \nyielding 400 Litigation Vouchers to be administered by the BHA, and that all of these \nLitigation Vouchers be made available only to minority families desirous of making an \nintegrative move into a predominantly white neighborhood (“NAACP Families” or \n“Skinner Families”). \n16.  The Modification Agreement further provided that the issuance and lease-\nup of the Litigation Vouchers were to be conducted in conjunction with housing search \ncounseling services to the prospective recipients.  Such services were to be provided by \nthe Boston Fair Housing Commission (BFHC), one of the program areas of the City’s \nOffice of Civil Rights, with the help of a $640,000.00 grant under HUD’s Community \nChoice Housing Counseling Program  (the “Housing Choice Counseling Grant”).  \n17.  The Modification Agreement obligated “[t]he BHA and HUD … to \npromptly execute [a] contract to fund the housing [search counseling services] and the \nBHA, HUD and the City … to promptly take any other steps necessary to expeditiously \nmake this funding available to the BFHC if and when the Court approves the \nmodification of the Consent Decree necessary to permit the use of the 400 Section 8 \ntenant-based subsidies set forth in this [Modification] Agreement.”   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 6 of 16\n18.  The Modification Agreement provided that all 400 Litigation Vouchers \nwere to be issued within twenty seven (27) months after the $640,000.00 Housing Choice \nCounseling Grant “can be drawn upon by the BFHC.”   \n19.  The $640,000 Housing Choice Counseling Grant intended for BFHC had \nalready been provided to the BHA in October, 1999 and was thus ready to be made \navailable to BFHC as of  February 8, 2000, the day the Court approved the modification \nof the Consent Decree.   \n20.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Housing Choice Counseling Grant was \nready to be made available to BFHC since February 8, 2000, the funds were not made \navailable to BFHC until August 26, 2002, thereby delaying the start up of the \nimplementation of the Modification Agreement by over 2.5 years. \n21.  Moreover, the BHA did not begin to issue the Litigation Vouchers to \nNAACP families until June 2003 –when it issued only 15 such vouchers. \n22.  Between 2001 and 2002, NAACP made numerous inquires to HUD, the \nBHA, and the City regarding the progress of implementation of the Litigation Vouchers.  \n23.  On July 2, 2003, NAACP requested that HUD transfer the City’s \nLitigation Vouchers, and the allocation for the related counseling services, to MBHP in \nlight of the inordinately slow pace of the City’s and the BHA’s implementation of the \nModification Agreement, in stark contract to the progress MBHP made in issuing and \nleasing-up the Litigation Vouchers under its administration. \n24.  Invoking a provision in the Modification Agreement regarding the method \nby which complaints such as the NAACP’s should be addressed, the BHA submitted a \nplan on July 25, 2003 to speed up implementation of the Modification Agreement. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 7 of 16\n25.  The BHA and BFHC reports for the two reporting periods following the \nnew plan (July – August 2003 and September – October 2003) showed dramatic \nimprovements in outreach, counseling, issuance of vouchers, lease-up success, and \nintegrative moves. \n26.  By a letter dated October 21, 2003, however, the BHA informed HUD that \nbetween 2001 and 2003 it had “borrowed” the subsidies for the 400 Litigation Vouchers \nto fund housing vouchers for non-Skinner Families, with the intention of replacing them \nthrough attrition.  As of October 2003, the rate of attrition was insufficient and the BHA \ndid not have enough money to fund all of the vouchers earmarked for Skinner Families. \n27.  HUD knew or should have known even before October 21, 2003 that the \nBHA had diverted funding intended for the Litigation Vouchers to other uses. \n28.  Neither the BHA nor HUD notified NAACP that the BHA used the \nLitigation Vouchers for purposes unrelated to the implementation of the Consent Decree \nor that the BHA had insufficient funds on hand to fulfill its obligations under the \nModified Agreement. \n29.  Between October 2003 and October 2004, the rate at which the BHA \nissued Litigation Vouchers declined and in some reporting periods the BHA did not \nissues any Litigation Vouchers at all. \nCalendar Year 2005 Renewal Funding for Section 8 Tenant-Based Vouchers \n30.  For Calendar Year 2005 (“CY 2005”), Congress changed the method of \nfunding the Section 8 tenant-based voucher program from a unit-based approach where \nfunding was provided based on the total number of vouchers authorized by HUD to a \ndollar-based or budget-based approach.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 8 of 16\n31.  Congress mandated that HUD renew each housing agency’s funding for \nSection 8 tenant-based vouchers based on actual leasing and cost data, averaged for the \nmonths of May, June, and July of 2004 (the “2004 Snapshot”), up to the maximum \nnumber of vouchers each housing agency was authorized to administer. \n32.  Congress further mandated that HUD establish and apply a 2005 Annual \nAdjustment Factor and that HUD make any necessary adjustments for the costs \nassociated with the first-time renewal of certain types of vouchers, namely tenant \nprotection vouchers and HOPE IV vouchers. \n33.  Finally, Congress mandated that HUD, to the extent necessary to stay \nwithin the amount appropriated by Congress, pro-rate each public housing agency’s \nrenewal funding allocation otherwise established pursuant to the funding formula \ndescribed in paragraphs 31 and 32 above. \n34.  For CY 2005, HUD applied an across-the-board pro-rata reduction factor \nof approximately 4% to each housing agency’s renewal funding. \n35.  HUD provided a fixed sum to each housing agency, and each agency was \nrequired to manage all of its Section 8 tenant-based voucher programs within that budget. \n36.  With respect to seeking CY 2005 renewal funding for litigation vouchers, \nHUD treated litigation vouchers as it did any other voucher; HUD failed to present \nlitigation vouchers to Congress as a separate line item request that evidenced HUD’s pre-\nexisting legal obligations under outstanding court orders and settlement agreements that \nrequired “unit-based” budgeting and appropriations for the full number of litigation \nvouchers at the full per-unit amounts mandated by such orders and settlement \nagreements. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 9 of 16\n37.  HUD made no effort, and thus failed to give Congress the opportunity, to \nhold Litigation Vouchers “harmless,” i.e., exempt from various measures to freeze and \notherwise restrict funding for the Section 8 program, including the dollar-based budget \napproach based strictly on units under lease, as opposed to units authorized, during the \narbitrarily set historic snapshot period that was instituted for CY 2005 and thereafter, as \nwell as the pro-rata reductions in HUD’s allocations to the public housing agencies \nnecessitated by Congress’s appropriating a lower amount for the Section 8 program than \nwas needed to renew even the units under lease during the 2004 Snapshot period. \n38.  During the 2004 Snapshot period, the BHA reported on average 217 \nLitigation Vouchers under lease per month, with an average subsidy of $1264.72 per unit \nor voucher.  This average subsidy was consistent with the subsidy needed for a three \nbedroom apartment based on HUD’s published list of Fair Market Rents for the Boston \nmetropolitan area. \n39.  The remaining 183 Litigation Vouchers, which had been “borrowed” by \nthe BHA for other purposes, were reported by the BHA as “All Other Vouchers,” with an \naverage subsidy of $977.05 per unit or voucher.  This average subsidy was consistent \nwith the subsidy needed for a two bedroom apartment based on HUD’s published list of \nFair Market Rents for the Boston metropolitan area. \n40.  Full renewal funding for the 400 Litigation Vouchers for CY 2005, had \nthey been held “harmless,” would have been not less than $6,025,032.  The actual \nrenewal funding for the 400 Litigation Vouchers was $4,770,096, leaving a shortfall of \n$1,254,936. \n41.  Under the funding formula mandated by Congress for CY 2005, including \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 10 of 16\nthe 4% pro-rata reduction factor applied by HUD, had all 400 Litigation Vouchers been \nleased-up and reported to HUD as Litigation Vouchers at the time of the 2004 Snapshot, \ninstead of 183 Litigation Vouchers being leased-up and reported as “All Other \nVouchers,” the BHA would have been entitled to an additional $627,976 in CY 2005. \nCalendar Year 2006 Renewal Funding for Section 8 Tenant-Based Vouchers \n42.  For Calendar Year 2006 (“CY 2006”), Congress mandated that HUD use \neach housing agency’s CY 2005 Funding Eligibility, prior to the pro-rata reduction, as \nthe starting point for renewal funding.  Congress then mandated that HUD establish and \napply a 2006 Annual Adjustment Factor and that HUD take into account any necessary \nadjustments for the costs associated with the first-time renewal of certain types of \nvouchers, namely tenant protection vouchers, HOPE IV vouchers, or vouchers added to \nan agency’s base allocation. \n43.  As in CY 2005, Congress further mandated that HUD, to the extent \nnecessary to stay within the amount appropriated by Congress, pro-rate each public \nhousing agency’s renewal funding allocation otherwise established pursuant to the \nfunding formula described in paragraph 42 above.   \n44.  For CY 2006, HUD applied an across-the-board pro-rata reduction factor \nof approximately 5.4% to each housing agency’s renewal funding. \n45.  HUD provided a fixed sum to each housing agency, and each agency was \nrequired to manage all of its Section 8 tenant-based voucher programs within that budget. \n46.  Under the funding formula mandated by Congress for CY 2006, including \nthe pro-rata reduction, had all 400 Litigation Vouchers been leased-up and reported to \nHUD as Litigation Vouchers at the time of the 2004 Snapshot, instead of 183 Litigation \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:78-cv-00850-DPW   Document 100   Filed 11/15/06   Page 11 of 16\nVouchers being leased-up and reported as “All Other Vouchers,” the BHA would have \nbeen entitled to an additional $640,119 in CY 2006. \nFirst Cause of Action –NAACP v. HUD \n(Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \nUnder the Consent Decree) \n \n47.  NAACP restates the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 46 as if separately \nset forth fully herein. \n48.  Every consent decree has an implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing. \n49.  HUD breached its obligation of good faith and fair dealing under the \nconsent decree by failing to request renewal funding for litigation vouchers in a separate \nline item that evidenced HUD’s pre-existing legal obligations under outstanding court \norders and settlement agreements that required “unit-based” budgeting and appropriations \nfor the full number of litigation vouchers at the full per-unit amounts mandated by such \norders and settlement agreements. \n50.

Its substantive provisions prohibit discrimination\nrelated to the rental or sale of places of dwelling. 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604-3606. In addition, it instructs the Secretary of\nHousing and Urban Development to\nadminister the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner\naffirmatively to further the policies of this [Fair Housing Act]....\n42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5). The specific question raised in this appeal is whether federal courts have the legal\nauthority to review claims that the Secretary has failed to carry out this last instruction. The district court believed\nthat, at least where the Secretary has not acted with a discriminatory purpose, the Secretary's compliance with §\n3608(e)(5) is a matter that Congress has \"committed to agency discretion by law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).\nAccordingly, it held that it could not legally review the appellant's claims of violation and it dismissed the case. We\nbelieve, however, that the court has the power to review appellant's claim that the Secretary has not \"administer\n[ed]\" certain HUD programs \"in a manner affirmatively to further\" the Act's basic policy. Hence, we reverse the\ndistrict court's dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings.\nI\nBackground\nNearly nine years ago, in April 1978, the NAACP sued the Secretary and other officials of the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (collectively \"HUD\"), claiming that HUD had failed \"to enforce constitutional and\nstatutory proscriptions against discrimination in Federally-assisted programs.\" Its complaint listed various acts\nand omissions related to HUD's administration of its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Urban\nDevelopment Action Grant (UDAG) programs in the City of Boston, which acts and omissions, it said, taken\ntogether, established violations of various civil rights statutes, including HUD's duty \"affirmatively to further\" the\nFair Housing Act's policies.\n\nIn 1983, the district court after trial found, as factual matters, that Boston has a history of racial discrimination in\nhousing; that Boston suffers from a shortage of low-income family housing; that a higher proportion of black than\nwhite families are renters and a higher proportion of black than white renters are families with children (and thus\nthat the housing shortage impacts more heavily on blacks than on whites); that Boston's neighborhoods are\nracially separate; and that \"at least in part [as] the result of the lack of safe, desegregated housing in white\nneighborhoods\" black families find it difficult to move out of black areas. NAACP v. Harris, 567 F.Supp. 637,\n640-41 (D.Mass.1983). The court also found that both city and federal officials were aware of these facts; that the\ncity had not effectively enforced fair housing requirements; that neither the city nor HUD had sought to obtain or\nto provide UDAG funds for low-income housing; and that HUD had not obtained from the city the assessment of\n\"any special needs of identifiable segments of the lower income population\" that HUD regulations then required. \nId. at 641-43.\nIn the court's view, these facts added up both to a violation of HUD's \"minority housing needs\" regulation and to a\nviolation of HUD's Title VIII duty \"affirmatively to further\" the Act's policy. In particular, it wrote that HUD's failure to\nuse its \"immense leverage under UDAG\" to provide \"desegregated housing so that the housing stock is\nsufficiently large to give minority families a true choice of location,\" in the context of Boston's history and\npractices, violated HUD's Title VIII obligations. Id. at 644.\nIn late 1985, after the parties had submitted proposed forms of judgment, the district court decided that it could\n152 not enter an order granting relief from the legal *152 violations that it had found. The court noted that in 1982\nHUD had obtained from the city an acceptable \"minority needs assessment,\" and held that HUD had thereby\ncured the violation of its own regulations, rendering further relief inappropriate. NAACP v. Pierce, 624 F.Supp.\n1083, 1085 (D.Mass.1985). The court also determined that it could not grant relief from the Title VIII violation\nbecause it did not have the legal authority to review the Secretary's compliance with the \"affirmative furtherance\"\nmandate. Id. at 1086-93. It held that Congress had not created any \"private right of action\" to enforce Title VIII's\nlegal obligation, and that it could not review the Secretary's actions under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\nU.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., because Congress had \"committed\" compliance with the obligation \"to agency discretion,\"\n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). The court accordingly dismissed the NAACP's claims. The NAACP now appeals this\ndismissal.\nII\nPrivate Right of Action\nThe NAACP argues that the district court's dismissal of its case is wrong because Congress, in enacting Title VIII,\nimplicitly created a \"private right of action\" allowing it to enforce \"directly\" the obligations that Title VIII imposes\nupon the federal government. See Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975). The short,\nconclusive answer to this argument, however, is that this court has recently held that Congress did not create any\nsuch direct private cause of action under Title VIII. Latinos Unidos de Chelsea en Accion v. Secretary of Housing\nand Urban Development, 799 F.2d 774, 791-93 (1st Cir.1986).\nIn fact, it is difficult to understand why a court would ever hold that Congress, in enacting a statute that creates\nfederal obligations, has implicitly created a private right of action against the federal government, for there is\nhardly ever any need for Congress to do so. That is because federal action is nearly always reviewable for\nconformity with statutory obligations without any such \"private right of action.\" See Abbott Laboratories v.\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (\"judicial review of a final agency action\n... will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress\"); \nAmerican School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110, 23 S.Ct. 33, 39, 47 L.Ed. 90 (1902) (where\nagency makes \"a clear mistake of law ... the courts ... must have power in a proper proceeding to grant relief\"); 5\nK. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise § 28.1, at 254-56 (1984); L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action\n339-53 (1965). This \"presumption\" of judicial reviewability, now codified in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\nU.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., applies not only to \"[a]gency action made reviewable by statute,\" but also to any other\n\"final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,\" 5 U.S.C. § 704. Any person\n\n\"adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action,\" 5 U.S.C. § 702, may ask a court to \"set aside agency action\n... not in accordance with law\" or to \"compel agency action unlawfully withheld,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706.\nGiven these (and related) principles of administrative law, as set forth in the APA, it is not surprising that cases\ndiscussing a \"private right of action\" implied from a federal statute do not involve a right of action against the\nfederal government. Rather, they typically involve statutes that impose obligations upon a nonfederal person (a\nprivate entity or a nonfederal agency of government). The statute typically provides that the federal government\nwill enforce the obligations against the nonfederal person. The \"private right of action\" issue is whether Congress\nmeant to give an injured person a right himself to enforce the federal statute directly against the nonfederal\nperson or whether the injured person can do no more than ask the federal government to enforce the statute. \nSee, e.g., California v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 101 S.Ct. 1775, 68 L.Ed.2d 101 (1981) (finding no private right\nof action to enforce Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 against a state); Cannon v.\n153 University of Chicago, 441 U.S. *153 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (finding private right of action to\nenforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 against private university); Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95\nS.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975) (finding no private right of action in shareholder to enforce 18 U.S.C. § 610\nagainst corporation). Cort v. Ash, the leading case on the subject, simply lays down a set of rules to help the\ncourts determine what Congress intended when the statute itself is silent.\nOne can imagine a few instances in which a court might, notwithstanding the APA, wonder whether Congress\nmeant to create a private right of action against the federal government. The APA, for example, does not award\nattorney's fees to a successful litigant. But see 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b) (authorizing award of attorney's fees against\nthe United States \"to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the\nterms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award\"). Yet, a particular statute might provide for\nattorney's fees for successful private enforcement of its obligations. A court might then have to decide whether a\nprivate party who enforces the statute against the federal government also is entitled to attorney's fees, thus\nrequiring the court to determine whether the action arises under the particular act or whether it is simply a general\nAPA-based request for judicial review. Cf. Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 484 F.2d 1331 (1st\nCir.1973) (holding that suit against the government under § 307 of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 was\neffectively an \"action brought pursuant to\" § 304(a) of that Act, and that successful plaintiff was therefore eligible\nfor attorney's fees); see also Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. at 699-701, 99 S.Ct. at 1958-60 (citing\nexplicit authorization of attorney's fee award against federal government in certain actions to enforce Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 as support for conclusion that Title VI confers a private right of action). Alternatively, a\ncourt might have to decide whether Congress implicitly means a statute to provide a party with a \"private right of\naction\" against one of the few federal bodies exempted from the APA's coverage. See 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1)\n(exempting, inter alia, Congress, federal courts, territorial and District of Columbia governments, and certain\nmilitary bodies). In other special circumstances, it might have to decide whether Congress implicitly means a\nstatute to confer a private right of action that differs in its procedural contours from the review that the APA\ntypically provides. See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (ordinarily requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before invoking\nAPA). One would ordinarily expect, however, that when Congress means to permit a private party to ask a court\nto review the legality of federal actions in a manner that differs from APA review, Congress will say so explicitly in\nthe statute. See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 160(e), (f) (setting forth provisions for review of NLRB orders). Otherwise, it is\nreasonable to assume that Congress meant the APA to govern.\nOf course, we recognize that to apply the APA will mean no review if (to use the APA's language) \"statutes\npreclude judicial review\" or \"agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 701(a). But this\nfact creates no anomaly, for it would be a self-contradiction for a court to find both (1) that one of these\nexceptions applies and (2) that Congress nonetheless intended to grant a private right of action permitting review.\nWe note that in those few cases in which courts have spoken of inferring a \"private right of action\" against the\nfederal government, the courts have not considered the role of the Administrative Procedure Act. See, e.g., \nYoung v. Pierce, 544 F.Supp. 1010, 1017-19 (E.D.Tex.1982) (finding a private right of action under Title VIII). Had\nthey done so, they might have found the discussion of \"private right of action\" unnecessary. See Munoz-Mendoza\nv. Pierce, 711 F.2d 421, 429 (1st Cir.1983) (suggesting that district court on remand consider civil rights action as\narising under APA rather than under direct private right of action). Regardless, no special circumstance exists in\n\n154 this case, or under Title VIII, that would *154 call for other than APA review. Hence, we affirm our holding that\nCongress intended no special private right of action against the federal government.\nIII\nThe Substantive Claim\nBefore turning to the question of APA reviewability, we consider the government's argument that we should affirm\nthe court's decision on an alternative ground. The government argues that § 3608(e)(5) imposes upon HUD only\nan obligation not to discriminate. It says that\nHUD's actions violate its obligations under Title VIII only when HUD engages in discriminatory\nconduct or when it funds a grantee who is engaged in such discriminatory conduct with the\npurpose of furthering the grantee's discrimination.\nBrief for Appellee at 19 (emphasis in original). Since the district court found neither actual discrimination by HUD\nnor an effort purposely to further the discrimination of others, 567 F.Supp. at 643-44, HUD, in the government's\nview, could not have violated § 3608(e)(5).\nWe do not agree that HUD's Title VIII obligations are as limited as the government claims. Rather, a statute that\ninstructs HUD to administer its grant programs so as \"affirmatively to further\" the Act's fair housing policy requires\nsomething more of HUD than simply to refrain from discriminating itself or purposely aiding the discrimination of\nothers. For one thing, as the government states its Title VIII obligation, it sounds very much like (and perhaps\neven less than) the obligation that the Fifth Amendment would impose upon HUD even in the absence of Title\nVIII. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-45, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047-50, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976); Norwood\nv. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 463-68, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 2809-12, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S.\n497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); National Black Police Association v. Velde, 712 F.2d 569, 580-83\n(D.C.Cir.1983),cert. denied,466 U.S. 963, 104 S.Ct. 2180, 80 L.Ed.2d 562 (1984); Clients' Council v. Pierce, 711\nF.2d 1406, 1409-23 (8th Cir.1983). Yet, the history of Title VIII suggests that its framers meant to do more than\nsimply restate HUD's existing legal obligations. See 114 Cong.Rec. 2281 (1968) (statement of Sen. Brooke) (a\npurpose of Title VIII is to remedy the \"weak intentions\" that have led to the federal government's \"sanctioning\ndiscrimination in housing throughout this Nation\"); id. at 2526-28 (statement of Sen. Brooke) (reviewing history of\nfederal fair housing efforts); id. at 9577 (statement of Rep. Cohelan) (decrying historical \"neglect\" of minorities); \nid. at 9595 (statement of Rep. Pepper) (lamenting government's slowness in establishing truly \"equal\" rights); see\nalso Clients' Council v. Pierce, 711 F.2d at 1425 (holding that even if facts do not establish constitutional violation\nby HUD, they still establish violation of affirmative duty under Title VIII).\nFor another thing, as a matter of language and of logic, a statute that instructs an agency \"affirmatively to further\"\na national policy of nondiscrimination would seem to impose an obligation to do more than simply not\ndiscriminate itself. If one assumes that many private persons and local governments have practiced\ndiscrimination for many years and that at least some of them might be tempted to continue to discriminate even\nthough forbidden to do so by law, it is difficult to see how HUD's own nondiscrimination by itself could significantly\n\"further\" the ending of such discrimination by others.\nFurther, the legislative history does not support so constricted a reading of the statute. It is true that the sponsors\nof the law, including Senator Mondale, its chief sponsor, made absolutely clear that Title VIII's policy to \"provide\n... for fair housing\" means \"the elimination of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. That is all it could\npossibly mean.\" 114 Cong.Rec. 4975; see also id. at 2279 (statement of Sen. Brooke) (Title VIII \"does not\npromise to end the ghetto ... but it will make it possible for those who have the resources to escape\"); id. at 9589\n155 (statement of Rep. Halpern) (Title VIII guarantees blacks the *155 right to live \"where [they] wish[] ... and where\n[they] can afford\"); id. at 9597 (statement of Rep. Brown) (\"sense\" of Title VIII is \"a rather nebulous support of civil\nrights and opposition to the last vestige of white supremacy or exclusivity as it has been exercised in housing\").\nBut it is equally true that the law's supporters saw the ending of discrimination as a means toward truly opening\nthe nation's housing stock to persons of every race and creed. See 114 Cong.Rec. 2274 (statement of Sen.\n\nMondale) (Title VIII is \"an absolutely essential first step\" toward reversing the trend toward \"two separate\nAmericas constantly at war with one another\"); id. at 2524 (statement of Sen. Brooke) (\"Discrimination in the sale\nand rental of housing has been the root cause of the widespread patterns of de facto segregation which\ncharacterize America's residential neighborhoods.\"); id. at 2985 (statement of Sen. Proxmire) (Title VIII will\nestablish \"a policy of dispersal through open housing ... look[ing] to the eventual dissolution of the ghetto and the\nconstruction of low and moderate income housing in the suburbs\"). This broader goal suggests an intent that\nHUD do more than simply not discriminate itself; it reflects the desire to have HUD use its grant programs to\nassist in ending discrimination and segregation, to the point where the supply of genuinely open housing\nincreases. This view of the effect that Congress intended is at odds with the government's very narrow view of its\nobligation.\nFinally, every court that has considered the question has held or stated that Title VIII imposes upon HUD an\nobligation to do more than simply refrain from discriminating (and from purposely aiding discrimination by others).\nThus, in Shannon v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 436 F.2d 809 (3d Cir.1970), the court\nordered a remand of HUD's approval of a change in the nature of an urban renewal project so that HUD could\nconsider whether this change would lead to increased minority concentration in the inner city and thus promote,\nrather than diminish, ghettoization. In Otero v. New York City Housing Authority, 484 F.2d 1122, 1134 (2d\nCir.1973), the Second Circuit held that, under Title VIII, \"[a]ction must be taken to fulfill, as much as possible, the\ngoal of open, integrated residential housing patterns and to prevent the increase of segregation, in ghettos, of\nracial groups whose lack of opportunities the Act was designed to combat.\" Accordingly, the court held that a\nHousing Authority might even ignore its own regulations giving assignment priority in urban redevelopment\nprojects to former site residents if it is convinced that doing so is the only way to prevent ghettoization of the area.\nSee also Alschuler v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 686 F.2d 472, 482 (7th Cir.1982); Garrett\nv. City of Hamtramck, 503 F.2d 1236, 1246-47 (6th Cir.1974); King v. Harris, 464 F.Supp. 827, 837-44 (E.D.N.Y.), \naff'd without opinion sub nom. King v. Faymor Development Co., 614 F.2d 1288 (2d Cir.1979),vacated on other\ngrounds,446 U.S. 905, 100 S.Ct. 1828, 64 L.Ed.2d 256 (1980); Resident Advisory Board v.

Resident Advisory Board, 435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1457, 55\nL.Ed.2d 499 (1978) (reaching similar conclusions). Furthermore, the Supreme Court itself has identified the goal\nof Title VIII as \"replace[ment of] ghettos `by truly integrated and balanced living patterns.'\" Trafficante v.\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211, 93 S.Ct. 364, 367, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972) (quoting 114\nCong.Rec. 3422 (statement of Sen. Mondale)); see also Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91,\n99 S.Ct. 1601, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979) (upholding standing under Title VIII where plaintiffs' only claim of injury was\ndenial of the benefits of an integrated community); Linmark Associates v. Township of Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85,\n95, 97 S.Ct. 1614, 1619, 52 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977) (characterizing Title VIII as \"a strong national commitment to\npromote integrated housing\"). We see no reason to contradict the consensus opinion set out in these many\ncases.\n156 *156 The government relies upon a recent Eleventh Circuit case, Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530\n(11th Cir.1984), as support for its narrow view of HUD's duties. In Anderson, a class of plaintiffs sued HUD,\nclaiming that HUD had illegally failed to counteract \"the deliberate footdragging of local governments\" in\nconstructing low-income public housing, which local delay the plaintiffs said was racially motivated. The Eleventh\nCircuit, in affirming dismissal for failure to state a claim, wrote that HUD itself is liable under Title VIII only\nfirst, when HUD has taken discriminatory action itself, such as approving federal assistance for a\npublic housing project without considering its effect on the racial and socio-economic composition\nof the surrounding area; and second, when HUD is aware of a grantee's discriminatory practices\nand has made no effort to force it into compliance with the Fair Housing Act by cutting off existing\nfederal financial assistance to the agency in question.\n737 F.2d at 1537 (citations omitted). This formulation, even if overly narrow, still does not support the\ngovernment's view of HUD's duties. It does not limit HUD's liability to purposive support of discrimination by\nothers, nor does it limit HUD's \"discriminatory action\" to activity that itself forecloses housing opportunities on the\nbasis of race. Rather, it includes within the scope of such action a failure to \"consider [the] effect [of a HUD grant]\non the racial and socio-economic composition of the surrounding area.\" And, the need for such consideration\n\nitself implies, at a minimum, an obligation to assess negatively those aspects of a proposed course of action that\nwould further limit the supply of genuinely open housing and to assess positively those aspects of a proposed\ncourse of action that would increase that supply. If HUD is doing so in any meaningful way, one would expect to\nsee, over time, if not in any individual case, HUD activity that tends to increase, or at least, that does not\nsignificantly diminish, the supply of open housing.\nHaving concluded that HUD's obligations under Title VIII extend beyond what the government claims, we must\nreject its request that we affirm the judgment below on the ground that HUD has not violated any legal obligation.\nThe district court's opinions state a plausible case of a violation of HUD's obligations, even under the minimal\nstandard set forth in the last paragraph. The district court stated, inter alia:\n1) In the case of the City of Boston ... [HUD's] efforts to ensure fair housing have been ineffective.\nIt has accepted from the City cosmetic changes in the form of a Mayor's Office of Fair Housing\nand some public relations efforts instead of genuine enforcement.\n567 F.Supp. at 644.\n2) [I]t had not required the City to establish an effective fair housing program in the face of\nknowledge of pervasive racial discrimination in the City.\n624 F.Supp. at 1085.\n3) The financing of desegregated housing so that the housing stock is sufficiently large to give\nminority families a true choice of location seems ... to be a[n] ... obligation of HUD under ... Title\nVIII.\n567 F.Supp. at 644.\n4) [HUD] has not used any of its immense leverage under UDAG to provide adequate\ndesegregated housing, except for Mission Park, which was not a project sponsored by the City.\nId.\nThese, and other roughly similar statements in the court's opinions, read as if the court had more in mind than a\ncrude legal standard requiring HUD to provide housing for all those in need. We agree that HUD has no such\nobligation. See 114 Cong.Rec. 4975 (statement of Sen. Mondale) (policy \"to provide ... for fair housing\" is not a\nmandate to \"provide housing\" but only to \"eliminate discrimination in the sale or rental of housing\"); see also \nJaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 758 F.2d 1086, 1103-04 (6th Cir.1985); Anderson v. City of\n157 Alpharetta,*157supra; Acevedo v. Nassau County, 500 F.2d 1078, 1082 (2d Cir.1974). Rather, the court's\nstatements read like an affirmative response to a claim that HUD's pattern of grant activity in Boston reflects a\nfailure, over time, to take seriously its minimal Title VIII obligation to evaluate alternative courses of action in light\nof their effect upon open housing.\nWhether the district court's findings are adequately supported by the evidence, whether in context they make out\na violation of law, whether and to what extent Title VIII obliges HUD to do even more than the minimum that we\nhave stated in this opinion, all are legal questions that we do not 00 and indeed cannot 00 decide on this appeal.\n97 97\nThey are not squarely presented by the case in its present posture and the parties have not argued them. Given\nthe nature of the record and the parties' arguments here, we find only the existence of a plausible claim of a Title\nVIII violation. We therefore decline the government's invitation to affirm on the alternative ground that HUD\nengaged only in legally permissible behavior.\nIV\n\nReviewability Under the APA\nWe now turn to the basic issue in this case. Is a claim of a Title VIII violation of the sort at issue here reviewable\nunder the APA? The district court, while believing that HUD had acted unlawfully, found that it lacked the power to\nreview and to correct that unlawful behavior. It noted that the APA qualifies the broad presumption in favor of\njudicial review of agency action, see Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. at 140-41, 87 S.Ct. at 1510-11,\nwith two exceptions. A court cannot review an agency's activities \"to the extent that (1) statutes preclude judicial\nreview; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 701(a). The first of these\nexceptions clearly does not apply here. The district court, however, found the second exception applicable.\nClearly, HUD possesses broad discretionary powers to develop, award, and administer its grants and to decide\nthe degree to which they can be shaped to help achieve Title VIII's goals. This fact, however, does not in itself\nmean that HUD is immune from review for \"abuse of discretion\" in exercising those powers. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\nRather, it simply means that a court is less likely to find against the agency, for the agency is less likely to have\nacted unlawfully. See Dugan v. Ramsay, 727 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir.1984); 5 K. Davis, Administrative Law\nTreatise § 28.5, at 271 (\"the key question is not whether agency action is committed to agency discretion by law,\nbut the extent that it is so committed\") (emphasis in original); Berger, Administrative Arbitrariness and Judicial\nReview, 65 Colum.L.Rev. 55 (1965).\nIn order for § 701(a)(2) to apply, the matter must be one that a court cannot review even to determine whether\nthe agency, exceeding the scope of its broad power, acted unlawfully. Such cases are few, and typically involve\nareas where the very act of reviewing may impede the agency's ability to carry out its statutory functions. See,\ne.g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568\n(1948) (disposition of applications for certificates for overseas or foreign air transportation); Braniff Airways v.\nCAB, 581 F.2d 846 (D.C.Cir.1978) (same); Langevin v. Chenango Court, 447 F.2d 296, 302-04 (2d Cir.1971)\n(FHA decision to permit rent increase in federally assisted housing); Hahn v. Gottlieb, 430 F.2d 1243 (1st\nCir.1970) (same); see generally Dugan v. Ramsay, 727 F.2d at 195. Thus, here, the question is whether\nCongress intended, or needed, in order to prevent unwarranted judicial interference with HUD's efforts to carry\nout its various statutory activities, to preclude review of whether HUD's pattern of behavior exceeds its fairly\nbroad range of discretionary choice.\nWe believe that preclusion is inappropriate here for the following reasons. First, the right at issue 00 the right to\n97\nHUD's help in achieving open housing 00 is a significant one. The congressional debates leave no doubt that\n97\n158 Congress thought it important. *158See 114 Cong.Rec. 2275 (statement of Sen. Mondale) (\"fair housing is a key\nand indispensable part of any solution of the interracial problems of our country\"); id. at 2703 (statement of Sen.\nJavits) (terming fair housing \"more important than jobs, and even more important than equal treatment under the\nlaw\"); id. at 2986-91 (statement of Sen. Brooke) (ghetto is a root cause of other social problems); id. at 9616\n(statement of Rep. McCormack) (\"[W]e must turn our face away from a course of segregation and separation.\").\nAnd, it seems reasonable to believe that plaintiffs wrongly deprived of that assistance over a course of time might\nrequire judicial intervention to obtain it. Cf. Hahn v. Gottlieb, 430 F.2d at 1250 (considering, in denying review of\nFHA decision to permit rent increase, fact that \"plaintiffs' interests are not threatened by every rent increase, and\nother forms of relief ... are available\"). Under all the circumstances of this case, the facts found by the district\ncourt (if true) strongly suggest a political process that has failed to offer plaintiffs adequate alternative relief.\nSecond, we believe that the court can find adequate standards against which to judge the lawfulness of HUD's\nconduct. This is a case in which plaintiffs, in effect, claim that HUD's practice over time, its pattern of behavior,\nreveals a failure \"affirmatively ... to further\" Title VIII's fair housing policy. The NAACP does not complain of\nindividual instances so much as it uses individual instances to show a pattern of activity, which pattern constitutes\nthe alleged violation. Thus, we need not decide how, or whether, a court can fashion standards governing when,\nor the extent to which, HUD should use an individual grant decision affirmatively to bring about desegregation.\nNor need we consider how a court is to review whether HUD in an individual instance has given appropriate\nweight to its UDAG mission \"to make ... grants to cities ... experiencing severe economic distress to help\nstimulate economic development activity,\" 42 U.S.C. § 5318(a), to its Title VIII objectives, and to various other\n\nfactors such as the importance of the case, the likelihood of success in achieving HUD's various goals, and the\navailability of resources. Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (holding\nunreviewable an FDA decision not to investigate a particular alleged violation, as the law authorizing\ninvestigations offered no standard for separating lawful from unlawful investigatory decisions); Hahn v. Gottlieb,\n430 F.2d at 1249-50 (citing difficulty of finding a standard for reviewing individual decisions to permit rent\nincreases).\nRather, here the court must decide whether, over time, HUD's pattern of activity reveals a failure to live up to its\nobligation. The standard for reviewing that pattern can be drawn directly from the statutory instruction to\n\"administer\" its programs \"in a manner affirmatively to further the policies\" of \"fair housing.\" 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(e)\n(5), 3601. This standard, like many, may be difficult to apply to borderline instances, yet a court should be able to\ndetermine a clear failure to live up to the instruction over time. It should be able to determine whether the\nagency's practice, over time, in respect to this mandate has been \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\notherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Doing so, in the context of a claim of serious failure\nover time to try to further Title VIII's goals, need not involve the court in \"superintend[ing] economic and\nmanagerial decisions,\" Hahn v. Gottlieb, 430 F.2d at 1249, or in reweighing matters that Congress has asked\nHUD to balance. Rather, this case seems to call for a more straightforward evaluation of whether agency activity\nover time has furthered the statutory goal, and, if not, for an explanation of why not and a determination of\nwhether a given explanation, in light of the statute, is satisfactory. See 5 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise §\n28.7, at 283 (\"Courts that are unqualified to exercise particular discretion are often ... qualified to determine\nwhether that discretion has been abused.\"). Such a case, obviously, is not easy to try, or to decide. Yet, we do not\n159 see how, or why, it is any more difficult than other civil rights cases *159 in which courts have judged the\nlawfulness of agency behavior against roughly analogous standards. See Adams v. Richardson, 480 F.2d 1159,\n1161-63 (D.C.Cir.1973) (upholding action against HEW for failure to enforce antidiscrimination provisions of Title\nVI); see also Iowa v. Block, 771 F.2d 347, 349-52 (8th Cir.1985) (permitting review of Secretary of Agriculture's\nfailure to implement discretionary disaster relief programs), cert. denied sub nom. Iowa v. Lyng, ___ U.S. ___,\n106 S.Ct. 3312, 3313, 92 L.Ed.2d 725 (1986); California Human Development Corp. v. Brock, 762 F.2d 1044,\n1048 n. 28 (D.C.Cir.1985) (statute permitting Secretary of Labor to disburse funds either on a case-by-case basis\nor according to a formula provides sufficient standards for review of reasonableness of formula even if court\ncould not review case-by-case determinations). Nor does it seem different, in principle, from other cases in which\ncourts have reviewed agency activity for abuse of discretion granted by even more generally worded statutes. Cf.\nRed Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 375-86, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1798-1804, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969)\n(upholding fairness doctrine as consistent with FCC's duty to promote the \"public convenience, interest, or\nnecessity\"); FCC v. RCA Communications, 346 U.S. 86, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1470 (1953) (overturning FCC\npolicy of granting licenses wherever competition is \"reasonably feasible\" as inconsistent with same mandate). In \nHeckler v. Chaney, the Supreme Court explicitly left open the possibility that the statute at issue there might\npermit review where \"the agency has `consciously and expressly adopted a general policy' that is so extreme as\nto amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities,\" even though there were insufficient standards for\nreview of particular decisions. 470 U.S. at 833 n. 4, 105 S.Ct. at 1657 n. 4 (quoting Adams v. Richardson, 480\nF.2d at 1162). Of course, we do not mean to say that individual grant decisions are not reviewable under this\nstatute 00 in appropriate cases they may be reviewable 00 but even if some, many, or all of them are not,\n97 97\nnonetheless in the kind of \"pattern or practice\" case before us there is \"law to apply.\" Citizens to Preserve\nOverton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).\nThird, and perhaps most important, we do not believe that judicial review of this kind of claim threatens\nunwarranted interference with HUD's ability to carry out its basic statutory missions. This is so for the reasons\nstated in the last paragraph. The legal claim before us is not that, in the case of any particular decision, HUD\nmust promote desegregation. Rather, the NAACP asks for review of a series of decisions to determine whether,\ntaken together, they violate the obligation to further the goals of Title VIII. To make this determination does not\nthreaten a large number of legal challenges or otherwise impair HUD's ability to make grants. Cf. Hahn v.\nGottlieb, 430 F.2d at 1250 (citing impact of frequent review on FHA consideration of rent increases); see also id.\nat 1250 n. 6 (distinguishing review of approval of an urban renewal relocation scheme from review of approval of\nrent increases on the ground that the former involves only one-time, as opposed to repeated, review). We do not\n\nsee how a one-time review of HUD's practices under an \"abuse of discretion\" standard can pose a serious threat\nto the agency's effectiveness.\nFourth, it does not seem impossible here for the court to develop an appropriate remedy. Of course, the court\nfaces the difficult task of avoiding both remedies that may be too intrusive, interfering with HUD's ability to carry\nout its basic grant-awarding mission, and those that may prove to be ineffective. This difficulty is not, however,\nunsolvable. We do not see any reason why the court cannot effectively ensure HUD's future responsible exercise\nof discretion while at the same time preserving for the agency its discretionary options. Cf., e.g., Louisiana v.\nUnited States, 380 U.S. 145, 155-56, 85 S.Ct. 817, 823, 13 L.Ed.2d 709 (1965) (affirming order of monthly\nreports of voter registration as part of remedy for pattern of discrimination in registration). In formulating its\n160 remedy, of course, the district court may, *160 as it has already done, seek the advice and participation of HUD.\nJust as we express no view now on the legal merits of the claims of violation, so we express no view on the\nremedies that may be appropriate. This task is to be undertaken by the district court in light of all the evidence,\nincluding any relevant events that may have occurred since the court rendered its initial decision. See624\nF.Supp. at 1092 (noting HUD's financing of Tent City and Columbia Point projects). We state simply that the\nproblems of devising a remedy do not seem insurmountable to the point where a conclusion of nonreviewability is\nwarranted.\nIn sum, we do not believe the legal claims raised here fall within the APA's exception for \"action committed to\nagency discretion by law.\"\nV\nAuthority to Award Relief\nThe government makes one final point. It says that HUD's actions here are unreviewable because they are\n\"inaction.\" As HUD acknowledges, the APA empowers the courts to \"compel agency action unlawfully withheld.\" 5\nU.S.C. § 706(1). HUD argues, however, that this provision does not apply here, as the Secretary's duties under §\n3608(e)(5) are discretionary and § 706(1) applies only to \"mandatory\" duties. See Conservation Law Foundation\nv. Clark, 590 F.Supp. 1467, 1472 (D.Mass.1984),citing 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise § 23.10, at 165\n(1983).\nHUD correctly points out that § 706(1) does not ordinarily empower a court to order an agency to fund particular\nprojects or to reach particular results. See NLRB v. Food Store Employees Local 347, 417 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 2074,\n40 L.Ed.2d 612 (1974) (where court overrules agency's exercise of discretionary authority, it should ordinarily\nremand rather than amending order); Silva v. Secretary of Labor, 518 F.2d 301, 310-11 (1st Cir.1975) (declining\nto order certification as to which Secretary has \"very substantial discretion\" even though past denial of\ncertification was arbitrary and capricious). Nonetheless, a court \"can compel an official to exercise his discretion\nwhere he has obviously failed or refused to do so.\" Mastrapasqua v. Shaughnessy, 180 F.2d 999, 1002 (2d\nCir.1950) (ordering INS to exercise statutory discretion with respect to petition for suspension of deportation order\nrather than arbitrarily denying petition); see also Iowa v. Block, 771 F.2d at 352 (court can enforce the \"clear duty\nof the Secretary to promulgate regulations which carry out the intent of Congress\"). To read § 706(1) as\nprecluding such an order would be inconsistent with the need to provide a \"hospitable interpretation\" of the APA. \nAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. at 141, 87 S.Ct. at 1511.\nAlternatively, the court may find authority to award relief under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), which empowers it to \"hold\nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" HUD argues that this provision is inapplicable because the\nNAACP does not seek to \"set aside\" any particular agency action. One can, however, reasonably view the\nNAACP's suit as one to \"set aside\" HUD's practice, which practice reflects an \"abuse\" of HUD's \"discretion.\" This\nview is consistent with the statute. The APA defines \"agency action\" to include \"failure to act.\" 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).\nThe purpose of § 706(2)(A) is to provide for judicial review of agency action and inaction that falls outside its\nstatutory powers. An interpretation of § 706(2)(A) that does not include an agency's \"practice\" within \"action,\n\nfindings, and conclusions,\" however, would prevent a court from setting aside those unlawful acts and practices\nthat reveal themselves only over time 00 that emerge from a \"pattern\" 00 the very sort of unlawfulness that courts,\n97 97\nfor reasons stated earlier, often find themselves best suited to handle. Similarly, the words \"set aside\" need not\nbe interpreted narrowly. A court, where it finds unlawful agency behavior, may tailor its remedy to the occasion. \n161 See Indiana & Michigan Electric Co. v. FPC, 502 F.2d *161 336, 346 (D.C.Cir.1974) (\"[W]hile the court must act\nwithin the bounds of the statute and without intruding upon the administrative province, it may adjust its relief to\nthe exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action.\") (quoting Ford\nMotor Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 364, 59 S.Ct. 301, 83 L.Ed. 221 (1939)), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 946, 95 S.Ct. 1326,\n43 L.Ed.2d 424 (1975). On these facts, we are not sure what difference, if any, there may be between HUD's\n\"failure to exercise\" the discretion conferred upon it by § 3608(e)(5) and its \"abuse\" of that discretion as revealed\nin a pattern of HUD activity. We conclude that the court is empowered to order a remedy either for an act or a\nrelated omission of the sort here present.\nThe decision of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
