On June 14, 1988, the Boston chapter of the NAACP filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiff sued the Boston Housing Authority (BHA), the mayor of Boston, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981-1983, 3604, 3608; and Massachusetts state law.</p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that the BHA maintained racially segregated public housing by discouraging Black applicants to apply to its site-specific waiting lists in the predominantly white neighborhoods of South Boston, Charlestown, and East Boston. The plaintiffs also alleged that the BHA had violated multiple court orders and compliance agreements from previous lawsuits dating back to 1962, as recounted in <i>Boston Housing Authority v. Atlanta Int'l Ins. Co.</i> (where the defendants sued its insurance company to pay for litigation costs and damages). 781 F.Supp. 80 (D. Mass. 1992).</p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Joseph L. Tauro. According to a later opinion, the plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction on July 12, 1988. We do not have additional information about the contents or the outcome of that motion. </p><p>Although we don't have access to the initial litigation documents, it appears that on the first day scheduled for trial, the parties asked for a private conference with the judge. Judge Tauro agreed to work with both parties in order to reach a settlement instead of continuing with litigation.</p><p>After more than a year of negotiation, the court approved a settlement on October 4, 1989. As part of the agreement, the parties stipulated that the plaintiff class \"include all minority applicants to the BHA who sought or inquired about BHA housing prior to June 14, 1988, and who have claimed or may claim to have been the subject of any discrimination based on race with respect to obtaining such housing.\" 723 F. Supp. 1554 (D. Mass. 1989).</p><p>The BHA agreed to integrate its white housing developments and pay damages. The BHA would pay $2,500 to each class member, except for those \"housed as emergencies.\" Those housed as emergencies in developments where minorities predominated would receive $1,000. For minorities on a waiting list to live in the neighborhood of Charlestown as of February 1, 1988, the BHA would pay $500. The BHA also agreed to pay all named plaintiffs an aggregate amount of $120,000. <i>Id</i>.</p><p>Half of the BHA's payments was to be paid by April 15, 1990; another 25% would be paid for each of the following years. The payments would go into a Community Benefit Fund containing $250,000-$500,000 in order to promote fair housing efforts in Boston. This fund was jointly administered by the NAACP and the BHA. The BHA also agreed to provide quarterly progress reports. <i>Id</i>.</p><p>As stipulated by the settlement, the plaintiffs filed separately for attorneys' fees. On March 16, 1993, the court approved a settlement for the attorney's fees. We do not know the result of the settlement.</p><p>This case has finished.</p>",

Flynn, as he is Mayor of the City of Boston and Receiver of the\nBoston Housing Authority.\nMEMORANDUM\nTAURO, District Judge.\nThe attached documents memorialize a step of significant social progress 00 a firm and unwaivering commitment\n97\n1555 to the objective of providing equal housing opportunity *1555 for persons of all races in the city of Boston.\nIt took only a few minutes for the parties to sign the consent decree I have just approved. But let no one\nmisunderstand that the relative ease of this ceremonial act was made possible only by more than a year of\nextremely difficult and challenging negotiations.\nOf course, being involved in a federal lawsuit is never as pleasant as a day at the beach. And when the issues\nunderlying a federal case involve fundamental matters of constitutional magnitude the potential for protracted and\ndivisive litigation is enormous.\nTo their credit, the plaintiffs and the defendants here recognized that, if this case were to be tried fully, the costs\nwould be incalculable 00 not only in terms of time and money, but more important, in terms of the potential\n97\nnegative impact on the morale of this great city.\nSome of you may remember that, on the first day scheduled for trial, the lawyers for both sides requested a\nprivate conference with me here at the bench. Lead counsel, Barbara Arnwine for the plaintiffs and Albert Wallis\nfor the defendants, asked me to help them settle the case. We adjourned to my lobby and I spent most of the\n\nnext three hours listening and asking questions, as the lawyers outlined the factors that divided them and led to\nthis lawsuit.\nIt was clear to me that emotions were high, feelings were strong, and the gap between the parties was as wide\nand deep as the grandest of canyons.\nBut what also came through to me was that, despite their adversarial spirit and tone, these lawyers were willing to\ndedicate themselves to the task of bringing about a remedial solution, rather than subject the city to the almost\ninevitable volatility that would accompany highly charged litigation.\nThere seemed to be an unstated determination on the part of everyone in the room that Boston would not\nbecome a Yonkers.\nAt that lobby conference, I outlined an agenda under which I would work with the lawyers in an effort to achieve a\nsettlement agreement satisfactory to all concerned. When we came out of that meeting, I reported in open court\nthat the litigation process was now on the back burner, and that a serious negotiation effort would be undertaken.\nAnd that's where we've been for more than a year. Dozens of tough and often confrontational working sessions.\nDraft after redraft of proposals and counter-proposals. On many occasions it seemed we were at a dead end.\nAnd then, somehow, perhaps because of some divine guidance or inspiration, a thought would emerge that\nprovided a crack of light in what had been a seemingly impenetrable wall. One step back, but two steps forward.\nA frustrating process, but somehow we knew we were making progress.\nThe documents we signed today are the product of that effort. They aren't perfect. No settlement is perfect. But\nthey do manifest an enlightened commitment and dedication to the concept that all persons in this city will be\nassured of equal housing opportunities 00 and that never again will race or ethnic background be permitted to\n97\naffect the housing choice of any man, woman, or child.\nSome might say that it's unfortunate that it took a federal lawsuit to bring us where we are today. And that may be\nso. But, in another sense, it is important to understand that we live in an imperfect world. Recognition of that\nreality is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the Founders had the foresight to set up the Judiciary, as an\nindependent and equal Third Branch of government 00 to be truly responsive when, for some reason, a member\n97\nof the community suffers apparent constitutional deprivation.\nBut, the courts cannot function alone in matters like this. The process works best when the underlying case is in\nthe hands of able, dedicated, and hardworking lawyers. And that's what we had here:\nBarbara R. Arnwine and Nadine Cohen 00 Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (for\n97\nNAACP)\nEverald F. Thompson 00 NAACP\n97\n1556 *1556 Laura Steinberg, William P. Stimson and Lynn Peterson Read00Sullivan & Worcester (for\n97\nNAACP)\nAlbert W. Wallis 00 City of Boston/BHA/Doris Bunte/Mayor Flynn\n97\nRod Solomon 00 BHA, et al.\n97\nRichard M. Bluestein and Janet Steckel Lundberg 00 Krokidas & Bluestein (for BHA, et al.)\n97\nDouglas H. Wilkins 00 Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development\n97\nJudith Yogman and Christine M. Roach 00 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\n97\nEach of these fine lawyers met their enormous responsibilities with the highest degree of professionalism as they\nrepresented the interests of their various clients, and I congratulate them for the great job they have done in\nbringing us to where we are today.\n\nAnd I want to close these remarks by making clear my firm feeling that the tone which made possible the\nsubstantive and symbolic achievement we recognize today had to come from the top. Dr. Benjamin Hooks, the\nexecutive director of NAACP, and Ray Flynn, the mayor of Boston, provided the patience and guidance that\nenabled those on the front lines of negotiation to hammer out and finalize this consent decree. I commend both\nDr. Hooks and Mayor Flynn for the critically important leadership they have provided.\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nI.\nThis Settlement Agreement is in furtherance of the Parties' mutual objective of providing equal housing\nopportunity for persons of all races in the City of Boston.\nII.\nBy entering into this Settlement Agreement the parties to this agreement have resolved the issues raised by\nplaintiffs' complaint, as amended, thereby avoiding potentially divisive and protracted litigation.\nIII.\nConsistent with the provisions of City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d\n854 (1989), this Settlement Agreement is made in recognition of, and in consideration of, the Preliminary Findings\nof Non-Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 contained in the Investigative Report of the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and all the pleadings, memoranda and other\npapers which have been submitted to the court in connection with this litigation.\nIV.\nThis Settlement Agreement incorporates by reference the terms of the Stipulation approved by the court on\nAugust 26, 1988, and the amendments thereto approved by the court on September 30, 1988. Said Stipulation\nand amendments are attached hereto as Appendix A.\nV.\nClass certification and notification procedures in furtherance of this Settlement Agreement are intended to ensure\nthat as many class members as possible are located, and to prevent attrition of the class. To those ends:\nA) Defendants agree not to oppose an amendment of the complaint to broaden the class definition to include all\nminorities, as that term is defined in the Agreement for Voluntary Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\n1557 of 1964 (the \"VCA\"), dated *1557 June 14, 1988, between HUD and the Boston Housing Authority (\"BHA\").\nB) The Parties will stipulate to certification of a class based on such facts as support appropriate findings under\nFed.R. Civ.P. 23(b)(2).\nC) The class is to be defined generally to include all minority applicants to the BHA who sought or inquired about\nBHA housing prior to June 14, 1988, and who have claimed or may claim to have been the subject of any\ndiscrimination based on race with respect to obtaining such housing.\nD) BHA defendants will bear the cost of all notification procedures included in this Settlement Agreement,\nexclusive of any costs incurred by the plaintiffs in furtherance of any ancillary outreach program conducted in\naccordance with the provisions of § V, ¶ E.\n\nE) Plaintiffs' counsel shall be provided with the list of the names, last known addresses and social security\nnumbers, if available, of all class members. Such information may be used by plaintiffs' counsel in furtherance of\nany ancillary outreach programs intended to locate class members. Said information is otherwise to be treated as\nconfidential. Plaintiffs' counsel may verify the process by which such list was prepared.\nF) The BHA shall notify members of the class of this Settlement Agreement and the Rule 23 certification and\nfairness hearing in accordance with the timetable contained in Appendix B.\nA Hearing Notice printed in English and Spanish, which shall be subject to court approval, shall describe the\nparties, the lawsuit and claims made therein, defendants' position, the negotiation process, the intended\ncategories of beneficiaries, the proposed settlement and procedures for applying for benefits. Additionally, such\nHearing Notice shall inform the recipient of the date of the fairness hearing and the right to participate therein,\neither individually or through counsel.\nThe Hearing Notice is to be mailed to the last known address of the following prospective class members: i)\npeople on the VCA and Stipulation remedial waiting lists; ii) people who qualify for remedial waiting lists, but have\nnot been previously located, or have withdrawn; iii) people already housed from remedial waiting lists; iv) people\nadjudicated discouraged; v) minorities housed as emergencies in developments where minorities predominated\nfrom October 1983 to June 1988; vi) minorities on the Charlestown waiting list after February 1, 1988; and vii) all\nnamed plaintiffs.\nThe BHA also shall publish legal notice, with tag lines in Spanish and Chinese, of the class certification and\nfairness hearing in The Boston Herald, The Boston Globe, The Bay State Banner and El Mundo.\nG) A Claim Notice printed in English and Spanish, which shall be subject to court approval, shall be mailed to\neach class member designated for payment by § VII, ¶ A-C, in accordance with the timetable contained in\nAppendix B. In addition, in order to maximize the notification process, the BHA shall conduct computer matches\nof the names and social security numbers of those class members to be mailed the Claim Notice, and not\npreviously located, with records of the Department of Public Welfare, Department of Social Services and the\nRegistry of Motor Vehicles. A Claim Notice shall be mailed by such agencies to each person for whom there is a\nmatch at each and every address that has been obtained from whatever source. The foregoing shall be\nconditioned upon the agreement of the agency involved to make the match. The BHA will make every effort to\nobtain such consent. As to each agency solicited, the BHA shall provide plaintiffs' counsel with the following\ninformation: number of names submitted to each agency; date of match; number of matches found under names\nand under social security numbers (a match under either name or social security number shall be sufficient to\ngenerate a mailing); date on which Claim Notices were mailed; and the number of Claim Notices mailed.\nPlaintiffs' counsel may monitor this matching effort by providing control names, addresses and social security\nnumbers to be added to those submitted to the various agencies.\n1558 *1558 H) In addition to the procedure for mailing Claim Notices, the BHA shall publish a Listing Notice, whose\nsize and content shall be subject to court approval, once a month for two consecutive months, in The Boston\nHerald, The Boston Globe, The Bay State Banner and El Mundo. Said Listing Notice is to contain the names (but\nnot other identifying data) of all class members to whom the Claim Notice was mailed but has not been delivered\nby the above described mailing process. The Listing Notice is to inform, in English and Spanish with a tag line in\nChinese, that the individuals named are entitled to up to $2500 in connection with settlement of litigation alleging\nracial discrimination in Boston's public housing. Plaintiffs' counsel and the NAACP shall be free to further\ndisseminate such Listing Notice without cost to defendants.\nVI.\nA simple application procedure for benefits shall be established. Class members, or beneficiaries of deceased\nclass members, who receive Claim Notice by mail, as described in § V, ¶ G above, must respond by the enclosed\napplication within 90 days from the postmark date. Class members, or beneficiaries of deceased class members,\n\nnotified by a Listing Notice, as described in § V, ¶ H above, must respond by application within 180 days of the\ndate of the last publication.\nAn application form printed in English and Spanish (to be agreed upon by the parties) shall call for the applicant\nto provide a current address, telephone number, social security number, one other piece of information found on\nhousing application forms that only the applicant would be likely to know (i.e. names and birthdates of children)\nand the applicant's signature. Additionally, the applicant shall provide the name, address and telephone number\nof a person likely to be apprised of a new address for the applicant should the applicant's address change.\nThe BHA, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Boston Chapter (\"NAACP\") and Lawyers'\nCommittee for Civil Rights Under Law (\"Lawyers' Committee\") shall offer assistance in filling out these application\nforms. Application forms shall be submitted by mail or in person by applicants to the Lawyers' Committee and/or\nthe Clerk of the United States District Court.\nAny dispute as to the timeliness or validity of any application shall be resolved by the court.\nVII.\nA) The BHA shall pay $2500 to each of the following class members, except those housed as emergencies who\nare provided relief in § VII, ¶ B below: i) people on the VCA and Stipulation remedial waiting lists; ii) people who\nqualify for remedial waiting lists, but have not been previously located, or have withdrawn; iii) people already\nhoused from remedial waiting lists; and iv) people adjudicated discouraged.\nB) The BHA shall pay $1000 to minorities housed as emergencies in developments where minorities\npredominated from October 1983 to June 1988, even if such minorities were offered remedial housing or a\nremedial transfer, or would have been offered remedial housing or a remedial transfer if they were still eligible for\npublic housing.\nMinorities who were housed as emergencies in developments where minorities predominated prior to October\n1983 shall receive no monetary award under this Settlement Agreement, and shall not be bound by the terms of\nthis paragraph. The NAACP and the Lawyers' Committee agree not to represent, or assist in representing, these\nindividuals with respect to any claim for damages to which they may be entitled based on their status as pre-1983\nemergencies.\nC) The BHA shall determine the number of whites who applied for housing after February 1, 1988 and were\nhoused in 2 & 3 bedroom units from the Charlestown waiting list (\"Charlestown vacancies\"). The BHA shall pay\n$500 to that number of minorities on that waiting list as it existed on February 1, 1988, starting at the top of that\nlist.\n1559 *1559 D) Except for payments to the Charlestown applicants, described in § VII, ¶ C above, no applicant shall be\npaid additional amounts as a result of eligibility in more than one category.\nE) The BHA shall pay to all named plaintiffs an aggregate amount of $120,000, which shall be divided by them in\nwhatever manner they deem appropriate. Payment to the named plaintiffs shall take place 60 days after final\napproval of this Settlement Agreement by the Court following the Rule 23 class certification and fairness hearing.\nF) Plaintiffs Boman and Hailey shall be placed on the remedial waiting list in the order in which they would have\nbeen placed pursuant to the Stipulation.\nG) All monies to be paid under this Settlement Agreement shall be disbursed according to the following schedule:\ni) 50% of the settlement to be paid by April 15, 1990;\nii) 75% of the settlement to be paid by April 15, 1991;\niii) 100% of the settlement to be paid by April 15, 1992.\n\nOn each of these dates, the BHA shall pay these sums into an interest bearing account. Payments to the class\nmembers shall be made from this account as soon as practicable after the date of payment into the account.\nPayment to class members shall be mailed no later than two weeks following deposit of the monies into the\naccount and a statement of compliance, containing a list of recipients, to that effect shall be filed with the court.\nH) Receipt of a damage payment shall not affect any class member's eligibility for public housing, nor shall such\npayments be counted as income for purposes of determining rental payments to the BHA within the meaning of\n24 C.F.R. § 913.106(c)(3) and (9) or 760 C.M.R. § 7.03. Defendants are to undertake all reasonable efforts to\nacquire the consent of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development (\"EOCD\") and\nHUD to this provision. The parties will jointly petition other public welfare agencies to preserve class members'\neligibility for any other governmental assistance program.\nVIII.\nIn so far as may be consistent with applicable law, any class member who would have been eligible for BHA\nhousing, but is no longer eligible due to a subsequent increase in income, shall be treated for the purpose of\ndetermining remedial housing eligibility as if that applicant had actually received and continues to occupy BHA\nhousing. Such class members, thereafter, shall be eligible under BHA's generally applicable policy with regard to\nover-income tenants.\nIX.\nFrom damages funds due to class members under § VII, ¶ A-C, but not claimed, an amount not to exceed\n$500,000, will be placed in a Community Benefit Fund (the \"Fund\"). In any event, the BHA shall pay no less than\n$250,000 to the Fund. The Fund shall be kept in an interest bearing escrow account in the names of, and to be\njointly administered by the NAACP and the BHA. Payment into the Fund shall be based on the same schedule as\ncontained in § VII, ¶ G above.\nThe Fund will be administered by a five person Advisory Board to be appointed in the following manner: two\nmembers selected by the NAACP, Boston Chapter, two members selected by the BHA defendants. The fifth\nmember is to be selected by the court and will serve as Chair of the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board shall\nhave broad authority to administer the Fund, consistent with the parties' objective of providing equal housing\nopportunity for persons of all races in the City of Boston. The Advisory Board's decisions shall be by majority\nvote. Within 60 days after its appointment, the Advisory Board shall advise the court as to the approximate\namount of time needed to accomplish its assignment. The court shall, thereafter, determine a schedule for further\nreporting.\nX.\nIt shall be within the sole discretion of the court to determine whether the appointment of a monitor is necessary.\n1560  XI.\n*1560\nThe BHA shall provide quarterly reports to plaintiffs' counsel advising as to the progress of implementation of this\nSettlement Agreement and the VCA in addition to any reports required to be provided under the Stipulation.\nAdditionally, the BHA shall simultaneously provide plaintiffs' counsel with copies of all additional reports that it\nsubmits to either HUD or EOCD pursuant to this Settlement Agreement, the VCA or the Stipulation.\nXII.\nPlaintiffs will file a separate application with the court for attorney fees.\n\nXII.\nThis court shall retain jurisdiction over this litigation pending complete implementation of this Settlement\nAgreement and the Stipulation. Following complete implementation, this action shall be dismissed.\nXIV.\nNothing in this Settlement Agreement nor the Stipulation shall be construed to prohibit plaintiffs from bringing a\nseparate lawsuit challenging the new Tenant Selection and Assignment Plan (TSAP), as finally implemented.\nDated at Boston, Massachusetts this 4th day of October, 1989.\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Boston Chapter, Tanya Boman and Annie Hailey, /\ns/ Annie R.

Flynn, as he is Mayor of the City of Boston and Receiver of the Boston\nHousing Authority; have agreed to amendments to the Court-approved Stipulation of August 26, 1988, which\nhave been submitted to and approved by the Court today. One of the changes made by the amendments pertains\nto the hearing process for applicants alleged to have been discouraged from applying to a Boston Housing\nAuthority development where the applicant's race did not predominate (Part 1.(B) of the Stipulation). The parties\n1573 have agreed, and the Court approves, that the hearing process will be administered by the *1573 American\nArbitration Association (hereafter \"AAA\") and that hearing examiners be appointed by the AAA pursuant to the\nProcedural Guidelines set forth below. The AAA, although not a party to this lawsuit, has agreed to assume all\nthese responsibilities and to be bound both by the terms of the Stipulation and the following procedural\nguidelines.\n\nProcedural Guidelines for the Conduct of Hearings\nThe following procedures supplement the Stipulation in this case, with respect to the administration and conduct\nof hearings contemplated therein. Any conflict between this document and the Stipulation shall be governed by\nterms of the Stipulation.\nAs used herein the term \"participant(s)\" shall mean the claimant whose claim is the subject of the individual\nhearing in question, and the Boston Housing Authority (\"BHA\").\nI. Intake\nA. The American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") will receive all claim forms at its offices. All claim forms received\nby AAA or the BHA will be date stamped. BHA will promptly provide to AAA the original of any claim form returned\nto it.\nB. All claim forms will be docketed upon receipt.\nC. Acknowledgement letters, with copies of the completed claim forms, will be mailed promptly to claimants by\nAAA.\nD. Copies of claim forms will be mailed by AAA upon receipt and docketing to BHA and the Lawyers' Committee\nfor Civil Rights Under Law of the Boston Bar Association (\"LCCR\").\nE. At or near the end of the claim period, AAA will commence scheduling of cases. AAA will entertain, but not be\nbound by, any requests of the participants regarding the date for a hearing. To the degree possible, AAA will\naccommodate claimants' requests regarding location and time for the initial hearing. Upon scheduling, AAA will\nsend notice of hearings to the participants and their designated attorneys or advocates which will specify date,\ntime, place and name of hearing examiner. AAA shall mail notices of hearings at least 14 days prior to the\nhearing.\nII. Panel Composition\nA. The panel size shall be 15 hearing examiners. Each hearing examiner shall hear no more than 3 cases before\nrendering written decisions. The total number of cases to be heard by one hearing examiner shall not exceed 10.\nB. Criteria for serving as a hearing examiner.\n1. Hearing examiners may be lawyers or non-lawyers, provided that the non-lawyers are\nexperienced arbitrators as determined by the AAA.\n2. Hearing examiners must agree to attend one training session.\n3. Hearing examiners must agree to abide by the terms of the Stipulation, including specifically the\nstandards for determining \"discouraged.\"\n4. Hearing examiners must not have conflicts of interest or be biased. Without limiting the\ngenerality of the foregoing, at the present time or for the past three years:\n(a) Hearing examiners must not have been an employee of the Boston Housing Authority (\"BHA\"),\nDoris Bunte, the City of Boston, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (\"HUD\"), Secretary Samuel Pierce, Executive Office of Communities and\nDevelopment (\"EOCD\"), Secretary Amy Anthony, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law\nof the Boston Bar Association, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,\nBoston Chapter (\"NAACP\"), any counsel or firm of record in this (principal) case, or any firm,\n\nassociation or organization which will represent any claimant to appear before any hearing\nexaminer.\n1574 (b) Hearing examiners must not have been a member of the respective *1574 boards of directors\nof any entity listed above, or a member of the NAACP.\n(c) The hearing examiner must not have had a financial interest, or be negotiating regarding a\nprospective financial interest, or be an immediate relative to a principal or have any partnership\ninterest in any business or concern of any of the persons or organizations named in this\nparagraph II(B)(4).\nC. Process for Selecting Panel\n1. The AAA will propose panel members, along with a resume or description of background sufficient to inform\nthe parties to the Stipulation. The AAA will undertake considerable effort to propose hearing examiners reflective\nof the racial diversity of the City of Boston as set forth in C.3 below.\n2. The Plaintiffs collectively (NAACP, Boman, Hailey) and the BHA Defendants collectively (BHA, Flynn, Bunte)\neach may peremptorily eliminate up to five proposed hearing examiners from the panel, provided that no\nperemptory challenges may be based solely on race of the proposed hearing examiner. Either of these parties\nmay propose to the AAA that additional hearing examiners be eliminated from the panel for cause. The AAA shall\ndecide in its sole discretion whether there is sufficient cause to eliminate any such additional panel member.\n3. In the event AAA determines that there are not a sufficient number of agreed-upon panel members, or the\npanel does not have a membership of 9 minorities, which shall include 3 Asians, 3 Blacks, 3 Hispanics, and 6\nothers, AAA shall ask each party to propose an agreed-upon additional number of panel members to meet the\nrequirements for the agreed upon racial composition and size of the panel. Such additional panel members only\ncan be challenged by the parties to the Stipulation for cause. The AAA shall decide in its sole discretion whether\nthere is sufficient cause to eliminate any such additional panel member.\n4. The timing and process for challenges to proposed panel members shall be determined by AAA.\nIII. Hearing Locations and Timing\nA. Hearings shall be held at the 230 Congress Street offices of the AAA or at one of the three designated\ncommunity sites to be determined by AAA giving regard to the preferences of the claimant and hearing examiner.\nB. Hearings shall be held either during the work day or in the evening, to be determined by AAA giving regard to\nthe preferences of the claimant and hearing examiners.\nIV. Hearing Process\nA. All hearings shall be taped. AAA shall arrange for the provision of the tape machines and tapes if possible;\notherwise, BHA will provide them.\nB. Within seven (7) days of the hearing either of the participants may submit supplemental written evidence to the\nhearing examiner, provided that notice of intent to submit such evidence was given at the hearing and a copy of\nthe evidence is provided simultaneously to the opposing party. A hearing examiner may schedule a supplemental\nhearing to take additional testimony, or take any other action s/he deems appropriate, to assure fairness to both\nparticipants with respect to such supplemental evidence. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a\nhearing examiner may postpone a hearing or schedule at an appropriate time and place a supplemental hearing,\nif requested by either of the participants where either seeks to submit rebuttal evidence not available prior to the\noriginal hearing, or where either of the participants is unable to procure attendance of witnesses or employees.\nC. The hearing examiner shall render his/her decision within twenty-one (21) days of the hearing.\n\nD. A written report will be prepared by the hearing examiner, be dated and signed and shall have attached all\n1575 written documentation submitted. A copy of the decision *1575 will be mailed to all parties and their counsel or\nrepresentative.\nE. Following the rendering of a decision, the tape of the hearing shall be filed with case materials at AAA. Either\nparticipant may transcribe the tape at its own expense.\nV. Rescheduling and Default\nA. Each participant shall be entitled to one postponement by notifying the AAA and the opposing participant at\nleast 24 hours prior to the scheduled hearing. Any further postponements must be based on good cause. In no\nevent shall any participant be allowed more than two postponements.\nB. Any participant who fails to show for a duly scheduled hearing shall be defaulted except upon good cause\npromptly brought to the attention of the hearing examiner. Decisions regarding defaults shall be made by the\nhearing examiner in his/her sole discretion, and shall be final.\nAPPENDIX B\n1.
