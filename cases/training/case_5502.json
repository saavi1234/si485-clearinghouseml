    "summary": "<p>On May 15, 2002, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, plaintiffs filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia, claiming that D.C. Jail officials violated their Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment rights in detaining them beyond their release dates and violated their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights by conducting blanket strip searches. </p><p>According to the plaintiffs, the District routinely strip searched and rebooked prisoners returning from court, even when charges were dismissed or they were otherwise ordered released. The prisoners would then remain in unlawful custody for as many as several weeks.  </p><p>The District moved to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim.  The District Court (Judge Royce C. Lamberth) denied the motion and held that the second amended complaint stated valid claims under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Bynum v. District of Columbia, 257 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C. 2002).  The District then moved for summary judgment, which the District Court denied as premature, given that discovery had not yet begun. Bynum v. District of Columbia, 215 F.R.D. 1 (D.D.C. 2003).</p><p>On March 31, 2003, the District Court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  The certified class consisted of persons who were overdetained by any DC Department of Corrections facility in the three years preceding the filing of the case, up to and until the date the case was terminated. (\"Overdetention Class\").  Plaintiffs' request for a sub-class of strip searched persons (\"Strip Search class\") was denied without prejudice as the sub-class as defined didn't meet the numerosity requirement.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27 (D.D.C. 2003).</p><p>Plaintiffs filed a second motion to certify the Strip Search class, changing the class definition to consist of persons who were strip searched as part of their out processing from DC Department of Corrections custody. The Court granted plaintiffs' motion and certified the Strip Search class.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 217 F.R.D. 43 (D.D.C. 2003).</p><p>While denying a pattern and practice of overdetentions and strip searches, DC agreed in 2005 to pay $14 million to settle the lawsuit:  $5 million to build a new Inmate Processing Center (IPC), $200,000 each to six named plaintiffs, over $4 million in attorney fees, and the balance to nearly 4,000 class members and administration fees.  The average payment per class member was expected to be about $2,700, but the amount would vary based on the length of over-detention.  The District Court (Judge Lamberth) preliminarily approved the settlement on August 25, 2005 and set the matter for a formal approval hearing. Bynum v. District of Columbia, 384 F.Supp.2d 342 (D.D.C. 2005).</p><p>Judge Lamberth issued a Final Approval Order after a fairness hearing in January 2006. Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F.Supp.2d 73 (D.D.C. 2006).</p><p>Rosenthal & Company was appointed as administrator of the class settlement fund.  Harold W. Johnson, Jr. filed an emergency motion to stay the distribution of the class settlement funds, apparently challenging the list of class claimants.  Following nearly a year of litigation on the issue, the District Court entered an order directing Rosenthal & Company to prepare a final list of class claimants to receive payment under the settlement, so that distribution of the funds could proceed. This case is closed.</p><p>Note that following the Bynum settlement, a new lawsuit was filed against the District, alleging that the practices of overdetention and strip searches continued despite the Bynum settlement.  That case was styled Barnes v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 06-315 (RCL).  [See JC-DC-5 of this collection].</p><p></p>",

Cunningham, The George Washington University Law School, Washington, DC,\nBarrett S. Litt, pro hac vice, Paul J. Estuar, pro hac vice, Los Angeles, CA, for Plaintiffs.\nMaria Claudia Amato, Leonard Harry Becker, Office of Corp. Counsel, Washington, DC, for Government of\nDistrict of Columbia, defendant.\nLeonard H. Becker, Washington, DC, for Odie Washington, defendant.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nLAMBERTH, District Judge.\nThis matter comes before the Court on defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' second amended complaint\n[12-1], which was filed on August 23, 2002. Upon consideration of this motion, the opposition thereto, defendants'\nreply brief, the oral arguments of counsel, and the applicable law, the Court finds that defendants' motion should\nbe denied.\nPlaintiffs' second amended complaint alleges that officials of the D.C. Jail conduct strip searches upon inmates\nwho return to the jail after receiving release orders. These searches are allegedly performed before the inmates\nare returned to the general prison population to await the results of a search for additional criminal charges\nagainst them. Defendants have moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), on the\ngrounds that these allegations fail to state a claim for relief under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nWhen assessing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs' factual allegations must be presumed to be\ntrue and should be liberally construed in their favor. Phillips v. Bureau of Prisons, 591 F.2d 966, 968\n(D.C.Cir.1979); Alexander v. FBI, 971 F.Supp. 603, 608 (D.D.C.1997). The complaint should be dismissed only if\nit appears beyond doubt that, under any reasonable reading, plaintiffs will be unable to prove any set of facts that\nwould justify relief. Haynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1254 (D.C.Cir.1987).\n2 The Supreme Court has set forth the applicable standard for assessing the reasonableness *2 of searches\nperformed upon incarcerated persons:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Applying this test, the Northern District\nof Illinois found that, in circumstances similar to the instant case, the Fourth Amendment had been violated. In \nGary v. Sheahan, No. 96-C-7294, 1998 WL 547116, *1, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378, at *4 (N.D.Ill. Aug. 19,\n1998), the Cook County Department of Corrections strip-searched all female inmates who had received release\norders before returning them to jail to await release. After balancing the jail's need for security against the privacy\ninterests of the inmates, the court held that the policy of strip-searching all female court returns violated the\n\nFourth Amendment. Id. at **14-15, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378, at **40-41. It decided that the jail should detain\ninmates who had received release orders in a receiving area while it determined that there were no outstanding\nwarrants against them. Id.,1998 WL 547116, *14, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378, at *40. Because there would be\nno need to return the inmates to the jail during this assessment, there would be no need for any of them to be\nstrip-searched unless the discovery of an outstanding warrant required her return to the jail population. Id.\nGiven the holding in Gary, it does not appear to this Court that it will be impossible for plaintiffs to establish a set\nof facts that would mandate relief under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Defendants attempt to\ndistinguish Gary on the grounds that plaintiffs do not allege that the D.C. Jail has the ability to detain inmates in a\nreceiving area pending a check for outstanding warrants. But plaintiffs are not required to make such an\nallegation in their complaint. All that is required is for them to have stated a \"short and plain statement of the\nclaim showing that [they are] entitled to relief.\" This they have done. The strip-search claim represents a valid\nclaim for relief under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and it would be inappropriate for this Court to\norder dismissal of this claim.\nThe scope of this ruling should not be overstated. The Court makes no finding today as to whether defendants'\nstrip-search policy does or does not violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Instead, the Court has\nsimply determined that it is unable to find as a matter of law that this part of plaintiffs' complaint should be\ndismissed at this initial stage of the proceedings.\nDefendants have failed to demonstrate that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs'\nallegation that their policy of strip-searching inmates violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nAccordingly, it is hereby\nORDERED that defendants' motion to dismiss [12-1] be, and hereby is, DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The Court has previously certified both an Overdetention Class and a \nStrip Search Class under both Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).  This is a hybrid \nclass action, certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) with regard to seeking injunctive \nrelief on over-detentions, and strip searches of inmates under the definition of the \nstrip search class set forth set forth herein. Therefore, regarding prospective \ninjunctive relief, no member of the class may opt-out. With regards to monetary \nrelief, the class is certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and class members have a \nright to opt out of the monetary relief stage. \nThe Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:  \n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District of \nColumbia Department of Corrections facility beginning in the three \nyears preceding the filing of this action on or about May 16, 2002 up to \nand until the date this case is terminated; and (b) who was not released, \nor, in the future will not be released by midnight on the date on which \nthe person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which \nthe basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired.  \nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except \nthat it ends on August 31, 2005. \nThe Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:  \n  4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-3     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 5 of 16(cid:10)\nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this \naction, up until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or will be (i) in the \ncustody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a \nDepartment of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or \notherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court appearance because \nthe charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was dismissed \nat the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted \nbail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to \nrelease; (iv) was returned to a Department of Corrections facility, to be \nprocessed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (v) was subjected to a \nstrip search and/or visual body cavity search without any individualized finding \nof reasonable or probable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons; \nbefore being released, regardless of whether he was over-detained.  \nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it \nends on August 31, 2005. \nCLASS-WIDE PROSPECTIVE RELIEF STRIP SEARCH CLASS  \n6.  The plaintiffs’ claims for prospective relief regarding the strip search \nclass will be resolved by the D.C. Department of Corrections’ plan to divert inmates \nordered released or otherwise entitled to release from the Superior Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia to a secure location outside of the open population of the D.C. \nJail or another location where they will not be subject to a strip search, absent \n  5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-3     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 6 of 16(cid:10)\nindividualized suspicion, while the record review for detainers and warrants and \nproperty retrieval are conducted prior to release. This process shall be implemented \non or before August 31, 2005. The Monetary Relief Strip Search Class will extend \nthrough that date. \n7.  The parties will defer the initiation of class notice until after August 31, \n2005. \n8.  If the District has not accomplished the change in the strip search \nprocedure by August 31, 2005, then any persons strip searched after that time will \nnot be members of the Strip Search Monetary Relief Class, will not be provided \nnotice of this settlement and may proceed to claim money damages separate from \nthis settlement.  \n9.  In addition, the Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class and class counsel \nwill be free at that point to pursue litigation in this case to enjoin the District’s \ncontinuing Strip Search policy, and the District will be free to oppose it. Any fees \nawarded to the class as prevailing parties for such litigation shall be separate from \nthe Class Fund Attorney’s Fees. \nCLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n10.  Marcus Bynum, Kim Nabinette, Leroy S. Thomas, Dianne Johnson, \nGloria Scarborough, and Julian Ford are hereby confirmed as Class Representatives \nfor the Class. \n  6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-3     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 7 of 16(cid:10)\nCLASS COUNSEL \n11.

R. Civ. P. Rule 23(g)(1)(C)(i), the Court considered the \nfollowing points in appointing class counsel: (1) the work counsel has done in \nidentifying or investigating potential claims in the action, (2) counsel's experience in \nhandling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted in the \naction, based in part on affidavits submitted by counsel in support of their motions to \ncertify (3) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law, (4) the resources counsel \ncommitted to representing the class; as well as other matters pertinent to counsel's \nability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.

The Court has previously certified both an Overdetention Class and a\nStrip Search Class under both Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).  This is a hybrid\nclass action, certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) with regard to seeking\ninjunctive relief on over-detentions, and strip searches of inmates under the\ndefinition of the strip search class set forth set forth herein. Therefore, regarding\nprospective injunctive relief, no member of the class may opt-out. With regards to\n4\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 5 of 78(cid:10)\nmonetary relief, the class is certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and class\nmembers have a right to opt out of the monetary relief stage.\nThe Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as: \n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District\nof Columbia Department of Corrections facility beginning in the\nthree years preceding the filing of this action on or about May 16,\n2002 up to and until the date this case is terminated; and (b) who was\nnot released, or, in the future will not be released by midnight on the\ndate on which the person is entitled to be released by court order or\nthe date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise\nexpired. \nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above\nexcept that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nThe Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as: \nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this\naction, up until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or will be (i) in\nthe custody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a\nDepartment of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or\notherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court appearance\n5\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 6 of 78(cid:10)\nbecause the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or\nwas dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own\nrecognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was\nacquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was returned to a\nDepartment of Corrections facility, to be processed out of Department of\nCorrections custody; and (v) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual\nbody cavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable or\nprobable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons; before being\nreleased, regardless of whether he was over-detained. \nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it\nends on August 31, 2005.\nCLASS-WIDE PROSPECTIVE RELIEF STRIP SEARCH CLASS \n6.    The plaintiffs’ claims for prospective relief regarding the strip search\nclass will be resolved by the D.C.

The Monetary Relief Strip Search\nClass will extend through that date.\n7.     The parties will defer the initiation of class notice until after August\n31, 2005.\n8.     If the District has not accomplished the change in the strip search\nprocedure by August 31, 2005, then any persons strip searched after that time will\nhave a new claim for that subsequent search, which is not covered by this\nsettlement.. \n9.     In addition, the Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class and class counsel\nwill be free at that point to pursue litigation in this case to enjoin the District’s\ncontinuing Strip Search policy, and the District will be free to oppose it. Any fees\nawarded to the class as prevailing parties for such litigation shall be separate from\nthe Class Fund Attorney’s Fees.\nCLASS REPRESENTATIVES\n10.     Marcus Bynum, Kim Nabinette, Leroy S.

The amount of litigation costs and the\ncosts of class notice and administration, which will be determined by the Court,\nwill be paid from the portion of the Settlement Funds that are to be distributed to\nclass members (as opposed to the reversion fund).\nCLASS AND SETTLEMENT NOTICE\n15.

A Fairness Hearing shall be held on January 30, 2006 at 10:00 a.m., to\nconsider: (a) the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement; (b)\nwhether the Final Order of Approval of Settlement, attached as Exhibit E to the\naccompanying Settlement Agreement, should be entered in its current or some\nmodified form; and (c) the application by Class Counsel for attorneys’ fees and\nexpenses (the “Fee Motion”).\n29.   The date and time of the Fairness Hearing shall be set forth in the Class\nand Settlement Notice, but shall be subject to adjournment by the Court without\nfurther notice to the Class Members other than that which may be posted at the\nCourt and on the Court’s web site.\n30.   Any Class Member who objects to the approval of the Settlement\nAgreement, the Fee Motion, the Named Plaintiffs’ Distribution or the Allocation\nAnd Distribution Plan may appear at the Fairness Hearing and show cause why\nthe Settlement Agreement,the Fee Petition, the Named Plaintiffs’ Distribution or\n \nthe Allocation And Distribution Plan should not be approved as fair, reasonable,\nand adequate, and why the Final Order of Approval of Settlement should not be\nentered, except that no such Class Member may appear at the Fairness Hearing\nunless the Class Member, at least two weeks before the Fairness Hearing, (a) files\n15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 16 of 78(cid:10)\nwith the Clerk of the Court a notice of such person’s intention to appear, a\nstatement that indicates the basis and grounds for such person’s objection to the\nSettlement Agreement, the Fee Petition, the Named Plaintiffs’ Distribution and/or\nthe Allocation and Distribution Plan, and all documentation, papers, or briefs in\nsupport of such objection; and on the same date (b) serves upon all Counsel to the\nParties (as listed in the Notice of Proposed Settlement), either in person or by\nmail, copies of such notice of intention to appear, statement of objections and all\ndocumentation, papers, or briefs that such person files with the Court.  The\nrequired documentation shall include information demonstrating that the objector\nis a Class Member, including name, address, date of arrest to the extent known,\nDriver’s License number and Social Security number. Final determination of\nwhether any such objector is a class member who has standing to object shall be\ndetermined solely from the Defendant’s (including Superior Court) records, as\nsupplemented by CSOSA records. In the absence of the timely filing and timely\nservice of the notice of intention to appear and all other materials required by this\nparagraph, any objection shall be deemed untimely and denied.\n31.

Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and injunctive relief for\ndefendant’s alleged violations of the fourth, fifth and eight amendments to the\nU.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs are prisoners of the D.C. Department of\nCorrections alleging that the District of Columbia (hereafter also “District” or\n“D.C.”) has a pattern, practice and policy of subjecting inmates to over-detention\nand subjecting in-custody defendants ordered released at their court appearances\nto strip searches upon their return to the D.C. Jail for processing of records and\nproperty before release. The named plaintiffs are Marcus Bynum, Kim Nabinette,\nLeroy S. Thomas, Dianne Johnson, Gloria Scarborough, and Julian Ford.\nThe Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as: \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 21 of 78(cid:10)\n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District of\nColumbia Department of Corrections facility beginning in the three years\npreceding the filing of this action on or about May 16, 2002 up to and until August\n31, 2005; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future will not be released by\nmidnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be released by court order\nor the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired. \nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above\nexcept that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nThe Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as: \nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this action,\nup until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or will be (i) in the custody of\nthe Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a Department of\nCorrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became\nentitled to release by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which\nhe had been held was no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was\nordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to\ntime served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was returned\nto the DC Jail or CTF from court, to be processed out of Department of\nCorrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual body\n21\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 22 of 78(cid:10)\ncavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable or probable cause\nthat he was concealing contraband or weapons; before being released, regardless\nof whether he was over-detained. \nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except\nthat it ends on August 31, 2005.\nIn the interest of avoiding expense, delay and inconvenience of further\nlitigation of issues raised in this action, in the absence of any admission of liability\nby defendant, and in reliance upon the representations contained herein, and in\nconsideration of the mutual promises, covenants and obligations in this\nAgreement, and for good and valuable consideration, plaintiffs and defendant,\nthrough their undersigned counsel, agree and stipulate as follows: \nI. Definitions and General Provisions \nA. Definitions \n.“Class Administrator” - A firm to be chosen by agreement of the parties, or\nappointment of the court if the parties cannot agree, to administer the claims\nprocess. Any firm so chosen must specialize in such work.\n“Plaintiff class” or “Class Member(s)” - All Class Members\n.\n.“Named plaintiffs” or “Class Representatives” - The original named plaintiffs in\nthe Amended Complaint to this suit:\n22\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 23 of 78(cid:10)\n“Claimant(s)” - Class members who actually file claims pursuant to the\n.\nprocedures set forth in this Agreement. \n“Class Fund or Class Settlement” - Lump sum payment to be paid by the\n.\ndefendant, totaling $12,000,000, which will be paid and/or distributed and\nallocated as further described in this Agreement.\n.“Class Fund Attorneys' Fees” - That portion of the Class Fund awarded as\nattorney's fees and costs to Class Counsel.  Litigation costs and the costs of class\nnotice and administration shall constitute a separate cost and will be paid\nseparately from the attorney's fees.  The amount of these fees, which will be\ndetermined by the Court, will be paid from the portion of the Settlement Fund that\nis to be distributed to class members (as opposed to the reversion fund).\n.“Defendant” - The District of Columbia\n.“Department” - The D.C. Department of Corrections.\n.“Fairness Hearing” - The final hearing on the fairness of this Settlement in the\nDistrict Court, at which the Court will determine whether to approve it.\n.Named Plaintiffs' Distribution” - The amount of the Class Fund to be distributed\nto the Named Plaintiffs.\n.“Plaintiffs” - As the term “Plaintiffs” is used in this document and Exhibit B (the\n23\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 24 of 78(cid:10)\nPreliminary Approval Order), it refers to all class members. In Exhibit D (the Final\nApproval Order), it refers to all class members who have not opted out.\n.“Preliminary District Court approval” - The date, following submission of this\nSettlement Agreement to the Court by the parties but prior to the conduct of a\nFairness Hearing, on which the Court grants initial approval of the Settlement\nAgreement.\n.“Final District Court approval” - The date, following submission of this\nSettlement Agreement to the Court by the parties, and after conduct of a Fairness\nHearing, on which the District Court grants final approval of the Settlement\nAgreement. \n.“Plaintiffs’ counsel,” “Counsel for plaintiffs,” or “Class Counsel” - The counsel\nof record for the plaintiff class. They are William Claiborne, Lynn Cunningham\nand Barrett Litt, Attorneys at Law.\n.“Counsel for the parties” - Counsel for plaintiffs and counsel for the defendant. \nB. General Provisions \n1. This Settlement Agreement is not an order of the Court, but a\ncontract, and all of its provisions are enforceable by the parties under\ncontract law.\n24\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 25 of 78(cid:10)\n2. This is a hybrid class action, certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)\nwith regard to seeking injunctive relief on over-detention and strip\nsearches of inmates under the definition of the strip search class set\nforth, supra. Therefore, regarding prospective injunctive relief, no\nmember of the class may opt-out. With regards to monetary relief, the\nclass is certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and class members\nhave a right to opt out of the monetary relief stage. The parties agree\nthat the monetary relief shall compensate for all alleged violations of\nrights and all claims and any other incidents of incarceration by the\nplaintiff class members that were or could have been brought in this\ncivil action under any theory of liability for any claims related to\nallegedly unlawful over-detentions and strip searches, except as to\nmonetary damages for those class members who choose to opt out.\n3. This Settlement Agreement comprises the full and exclusive\nagreement of the parties with respect to the matters discussed herein.\nThis agreement incorporates and supersedes any other agreements.\nNo representations or inducements to compromise this action have\nbeen made, other than those recited in this Agreement.\nII. Class-wide Prospective Relief\n25\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 26 of 78(cid:10)\nA. Strip Search Class\n1. The plaintiffs’ claims for prospective relief regarding the strip\nsearch class will be resolved by the D.C. Department of\nCorrections’ plan to divert inmates ordered released or otherwise\nentitled to release from the Superior Court of the District of\nColumbia to a secure location outside of the open population of\nthe D.C. Jail or another location where they will not be subject to a\nstrip search, absent individualized suspicion, while the record\nreview for detainers and warrants and property retrieval are\nconducted prior to release. This process shall be implemented on\nor before August 31, 2005. The Monetary Relief Strip Search\nClass will extend through that date.\n2. The parties will defer the initiation of class notice until after\nAugust 31, 2005.\n3. If the District has not accomplished the change in the strip search\nprocedure by August 31, 2005, then any persons strip searched\nafter that time will have a new claim for that subsequent search,\nwhich is not covered by this settlement. \n4. In addition, in the scenario set forth in paragraph 3 immediately\n26\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 27 of 78(cid:10)\nabove, the Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class and class counsel\nwill be free at that point to pursue additional litigation in this case\nto enjoin the District’s continuing Strip Search policy, and the\nDistrict will be free to oppose it. Any fees awarded to the class as\nprevailing parties for such litigation shall be separate from the\nClass Fund Attorney’s Fees.\n5. The parties note that the court has previously entered orders\ncertifying both an Over-detention and Strip Search class; that no\nmaterial modifications have been made to that definition; that the\ncourt has made the findings necessary to support the certification\nand no further findings are necessary in this regard; and that the\nClass Counsel listed above were appointed at that time as counsel\nfor the class.\n27\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 28 of 78(cid:10)\n B. Successors \nThe terms of the Agreement shall each be binding on the\nPlaintiffs and the District of Columbia, and their successors\nand assigns, subject to the modification clause set forth in\nSection C, below.\nC.  Modification as a Result of Changes in Applicable Law \nThe parties recognize that, following execution of this\nAgreement, there may be changes in controlling law that\nwarrant modification. The Settlement Agreement shall be\nsubject to modification by the Court upon the application of\neither party based on changes in applicable state or federal law\nafter August 31, 2005, as it relates to injunctive relief. No\nmodification shall apply as it relates to monetary relief. \nIII. Class-wide Monetary Relief \nA. Monetary Payments \n1. Within 45 days of the Final District Court approval of this\nsettlement, the District will pay the sum of $12 million (“the\nSettlement Funds”), less the costs advanced by the District for\n28\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 29 of 78(cid:10)\npreparation and publication of the Class Notice and related\nadministrative expenses, which amount shall be deemed to be\nin exchange for a full and final release of all claims to be\ncontained in the Final Order of Approval of Settlement. The\npayment will be such that the funds will be deposited and\ncleared through the appropriate accounts within that 45-day\nperiod. How the funds will be used and allocated is addressed\nin ¶¶ III (A)(3-6) below.\n2.  If no appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme\nCourt of the United States has been filed, then the settlement\nfunds will be paid on the timetable set forth in the preceding\nparagraph. If an appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari to\nthe Supreme Court of the United States has been filed, then\nthe District shall distribute the Settlement Funds in\naccordance with the provisions of ¶¶ III (A)(3-6) below\nwithin 30 days of the date that all appellate avenues of review\nhave been exhausted, including Supreme Court review, if the\nsettlement is ultimately approved. If the result of the appeal or\nSupreme Court review is that the settlement is not ultimately\n29\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 30 of 78(cid:10)\napproved, then the case shall revert to active litigation, and\nthe District shall have no responsibility to pay any Settlement\nFunds not previously paid for the costs of class notice and\nrelated administrative expenses. \n3. The parties agree that $3 million of the $12 million payment referenced above\nwill revert to the D.C. Department of Corrections to be spent on programs and\nservices which relate to the subject of this complaint (hereafter “reversion fund”).\nThese funds may be spent on new staff, services, construction, technology,\nequipment, programs or other activities otherwise necessary to improve or assist\nin processing inmates for release of inmates and to reduce incidents of over-\ndetention and the need to strip search, without individualized suspicion, inmates\nwho meet the definition of the strip search class. It is understood that the\nreversion fund exists to fund the injunctive relief changes necessary to eliminate\nthe over-detentions and strips searches that are the subject of this lawsuit and will\nbe for new programs or activities not previously budgeted (and specifically not as\na part of the general budget). The mediators in the case will work with the parties\nto identify specifically how and when the reversionary amount will be spent. If,\nby August 31, 2005, the parties have been unable to agree specifically how all of\nthese funds will be spent, either side may submit its proposals to the Court, which\n30\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 31 of 78(cid:10)\nwill then decide how to spend any amount not otherwise agreed to based on the\ncriteria set forth above. This decision will be binding and may not be appealed by\neither side.\n4. The parties agree that the injunctive relief objective of this agreement is the\nelimination of over-detentions and court release strip searches. To that end, the\nDistrict will, for a period of two years, provide to Class Counsel annually a report\non whether 1) it has strip searched any court returns entitled to release absent\nindividualized reasonable suspicion to do so, and whether 2) it has released any\ndetainees or inmates more than 24 hours after the time they become entitled to\nrelease, and the reasons therefore.\n5 The parties agree that the settlement amount shall include all\nattorneys’ fees and costs. Plaintiffs intend to submit a petition\nfor attorneys’ fees and costs to the Court for the sum of $4\nmillion dollars. Defendant takes no position regarding the\nPlaintiffs’ petition for attorneys’ fees and costs. If the Court\nawards less than $4 million for the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees\ncosts, the remainder of the $4 million shall revert to the\nDistrict of Columbia on programs and services that relate to\n31\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 32 of 78(cid:10)\nthe subject of this complaint, and shall be subject to the same\nterms as are set forth in ¶ III(A)(3) above.\n6. The parties agree that $5 million dollars of the settlement\namount shall be used for the compensation of the plaintiffs\nand for the administration and distribution of the monetary\ncompensation fund, including the claims verification\nprocedure. The plaintiffs will develop a plan of distribution to\naddress all of the plaintiffs’ claims and that plan shall be\nsubmitted to the Court for approval. The claims procedure\nshall include a verification process to ensure that claimants\nare members of one or both classes, and the length of the\nclaimants’ over-detention. The Claims Administrator and\nClass Counsel will distributethis money according to the\n \nterms of the Final Order of Approval of Settlement. Plaintiffs\nshall use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the\nsettlement amount will occur in such a way so that no residual\namount (of the $5 million compensation fund) will remain\nfollowing final distribution. However, if some residual\nhappens to remain after reasonable efforts to distribute funds\n32\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 33 of 78(cid:10)\nto class members who have filed claims have been exhausted,\nthe residual amount will revert to the reversion fund defined\nin ¶ III(A)(3) above. \nIV. Procedures for Approval of the Final Settlement Agreement\nA. Application for Preliminary Approval \nThe parties will apply for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement\nAgreement by June 16, 2005. At that time, the proposed Order of\nFinal Approval of Settlement will be presented to the court. A hearing\nwill be held within 30 days thereafter, at which time the court will\nmake a preliminary determination that the settlement appears fair,\nadequate and just; determine whether it will approve the class notice;\nand set a date for the Fairness Hearing and any other dates that need\nto be determined. \nB. Notice to Potential Claimants \n1. Application for Preliminary District Court approval shall occur as\nsoon as is practicable. However, since the definition of the\nMonetary Relief classes (both Over-detention and Strip Search)\nextends through August 31, 2005, notice will be sent as soon as\npracticable after that date. At that time, a copy of the Notice (set\n33\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 34 of 78(cid:10)\nforth in Exhibit C) and the Claim Form (set forth in Exhibit D)\nshall be distributed to every person identified as a class member. \n2. Plaintiffs will distribute the Notice and Claim Form by first class\nmail to the last known address of each class member.\n3. The District will pay to the Class Administrator the costs of\npreparing and publishing the Class Notice and other expenses\nrelated to the publication and distribution of notice to the class.\nThe Class Administrator shall provide an estimate of the costs of\nnotice no later than July 20, 2005, and the necessary funds shall be\npaid to the Class Administrator no later than August 8, 2005, and\nsupplemented in the event the Class Administrator provides a\nsupplemental estimate. Any such payments shall be credited\nagainst the $12 Million Class Settlement. However, if for any\nreason this settlement is not ultimately approved, the District shall\nhave no claim against Plaintiffs, the Class or Class Counsel for\nreimbursement of the costs of notice and related costs for which it\nadvanced funds, except to be credited in any subsequent\nsettlement of this case. \n34\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 35 of 78(cid:10)\n4. A modified and shortened form of the Class Notice shall be\npublished by plaintiffs at least in the following newspapers:\nWashington Post, Washington Times and the City Paper, as well\nas such regional newspapers as plaintiffs shall determine, in\nconsultation with the Class Administrator, are reasonably\nnecessary to provide notice to the class, not to exceed three\nregional newspapers, unless plaintiffs obtain consent from\ndefendants, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or approval\nfrom the court. The notice shall be published twice a week for two\nweeks, in the section of the newspaper ordinarily devoted to local\nnews. Publication shall occur on at least one Sunday for each\nnewspaper with a Sunday edition.\n5. Defendant shall post the Notice on each Unit of the D.C. Jail and\nthe Correctional Treatment Facility, along with extra copies of the\nClaim Form.

Administrative Issues\n1. Plaintiffs, acting through Class Counsel and the Class\nAdministrator, shall have sole responsibility for determining the\nclass distribution formula, the weight to be given to various\nfactors, and the proportionate distribution between Over-detention\nand Strip Search Class members, for distribution of the monetary\nportion of the settlement going to class members, subject to\n37\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 38 of 78(cid:10)\nultimate approval approved by the Court. The Defendant shall take\nno position on these issues.\n2. The Distribution system that Plaintiffs will propose to the court\nwill be a point system that will rely solely on on the information\nobtained from the Defendant’s (including Superior Court) records,\nas supplemented by CSOSA records, with the exception of the\nNamed Plaintiffs.\n3. No later than July 30, 2005, the District of Columbia shall make\navailable, to the extent that such information has not already been\nprovided, the name, address, social security number, date of birth\nand driver's license information of class members, to the extent it\nexists and is reasonably available from its records, to Class\nCounsel, to be forwarded to the Class Administrator in\ncomputerized form (to the extent it exists in computerized form),\nto facilitate locating class members. Such information shall be\nconfidential, and may not be disclosed to anyone except counsel of\nrecord, the Class Administrator, and such representatives of the\nDistrict of Columbia and, to the extent provided by court orders\nand agreement of counsel, counsel of record in Watson v. District\n38\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 39 of 78(cid:10)\nof Columbia, Case No. 02-980 (GK-JMF). This information shall\ncover the class period until June 30, 2005. The period July 1 to\nAugust 31, 2005, shall be provided in a supplemental submission\nby no later than September 10, 2005.\n4. Defendant shall make available to plaintiffs’ counsel from the\nJACCS and CIS computer databases, and other databases, and\npaper records, information reasonably necessary for administration\nand verification of claims, to the extent necessary and reasonably\naccessible.\n5. The Defendant undertakes to use reasonable efforts to assist\nPlaintiffs in obtaining from Court Services and Offender\nSupervision Agency (“CSOSA”) prior to the deadline for sending\nnotice, upon a written request from Class Counsel the most recent\naddress, social security number, date of birth and driver's license\ninformation, to the extent reasonably available, in computerized\nform, of the Class Members, so that the data can be provided to the\nClass Administrator.\n6. Plaintiffs will use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the\nsettlement amount will occur in such a way as to insure that no\n39\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 40 of 78(cid:10)\nresidual amount of money will remain following final distribution.\nThis will likely include a second round of distribution to class\nmembers who have filed claims for amounts allocated to class\nmembers who do file claims but then become unavailable. If some\nresidual happens to remain after all reasonable efforts to distribute\nfunds to class members who have filed claims have been\nexhausted, stemming from the accrual of interest, for example, this\nwill revert to the reversion fund defined in ¶ III(A)(3) above.\n7. The reversion of any portion of the class fund to the District of\nColumbia does not affect the amount of the class fund for\npurposes of determining the percentage of attorney’s fees to be\npaid class counsel (see Definition of Class Fund Attorney’s Fees,\nabove) or the timing of that payment.\nVI. Non-admission\nThe plaintiffs allege in their Amended Complaint that the Department\nhas engaged in a pattern and practice of over-detention and unlawful\nstrip searching. Defendant denies those allegations. Entry of the\nAgreement does not operate as an admission of liability by the D.C.\n40\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 41 of 78(cid:10)\nDepartment of Corrections or the District of Columbia of Plaintiffs’\nallegations.\nVII. Amendments\nWith the consent of the parties, additional provisions may be added to\nthis Settlement Agreement if needed to assure appropriate\nimplementation and court approval. \nSigned and Agreed to by: \nROBERT J.

IF, BETWEEN THE DATES OF MAY 16, 1999, AND AUGUST 31,\n2005, YOU WERE IN ANY DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS\nFACILITY, AND EITHER 1) YOU WERE NOT RELEASED BY MIDNIGHT OF THE DAY YOU\nBECAME ENTITLED TO RELEASE BY COURT ORDER OR EXPIRATION OF SENTENCE, OR\n2) YOU APPEARED IN COURT AND THE JUDGE ORDERED YOU RELEASED, AND THERE\nWAS NO OTHER REASON FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO DETAIN YOU, BUT YOU\nWERE STRIP SEARCHED BEFORE YOUR RELEASE, \nYOU MAY BE A CLASS MEMBER AND ENTITLED TO MONEY.\nThere is currently pending a class action lawsuit in the United States\nDistrict Court, District of Columbia.  The Court has certified the case as a class\naction.  If the proposed settlement receives final court approval, CLASS\nMEMBERS are eligible to receive money.\nDistrict of Columbia records show that you may be a CLASS MEMBER.\nTherefore, you may be eligible to receive MONEY.

What Is The Class Action Lawsuit About?\nThis lawsuit involves the alleged policy and/or practice of the District of\nColumbia Department of Corrections of either (1) holding inmates an\nunreasonable time after their release dates, or (2) strip searching inmates after they\nappeared in court and became entitled to release. \n2.  Who Is A Member Of The Class?\nYou are a member of the class if you meet the class definition (summarized\nabove and set forth fully in the judge’s orders) and your claim can be verified from\nthe records of the District of Columbia (including the records of the Superior\nCourt of the District of Columbia).\nThe District of Columbia or the Superior Court of the District of Columbia\nmust have a record of your being in custody such that officials can identify you\nindividually by true name and other methods of identification and ascertain that\nyou qualify as someone who was either detained too long or strip searched after\nClass Notice – Bynum v. District of Columbia.; P.O. Box __________; Novato, Calif.\n94948-6177 45\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 46 of 78(cid:10)\nhaving become entitled to release. Such records are the final determinant of who\nqualifies as a member of the class.  \n3.  What Is The Purpose Of This Notice?\nYou have a right to know about a proposed Settlement of this class action\nlawsuit and about all of your options before the Court decides whether to give\nfinal approval to the Settlement. Your rights may be affected by this lawsuit.\nThis information is being sent to everyone who is or may be a member of\nthe class based upon the last known address available from the records of the\nDistrict of Columbia, and otherwise publicized to reach class members. \nThis Notice explains the lawsuit, the Settlement, your legal rights, what\nbenefits are obtained, who is eligible and how to file a claim. \nThe Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia. The case is known as Bynum v. District of Columbia, et al.,\nCase No. 02-956 (RCL). The people who brought the case are called Plaintiffs,\nand the people they sued are called Defendants.\n4.  Why Is This A Class Action?\nIn a class action, one or more person(s), called the Class Representative(s),\nsue on behalf of a group of people who have similar claims – the class members.\nOne court then resolves the issues for all class members, except for those who\nexclude themselves from the class. \n5.  Why Is There A Settlement?\nAlthough the Court has not decided whether the claims in this lawsuit are\ncorrect, both sides have agreed to a Settlement. That way, both sides are able to\navoid the risks and costs of a trial, the case can be resolved and the benefits of the\nSettlement can be made immediately available to the Class Members.

Box __________; Novato, Calif.\n94948-6177 46\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 47 of 78(cid:10)\nRepresentatives and their attorneys think that the proposed Settlement is fair to the\nClass Members and the parties in the case and think that the terms of the\nSettlement are a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of this matter.\n6.  Are There Lawyers Representing You?\nThe Court has approved three lawyers (called \"Class Counsel\") to\ncollectively represent you. You will not be asked to pay your own personal money\nfor the services of these attorneys and their associates and staff in litigating this\ncase and negotiating this Settlement. Instead, the lawyers will seek payment from\nthe fund obtained on behalf of the class, as is described further below. Only class\ncounsel may act on behalf of the class. However, that does not prevent you from\nhiring your own lawyer to advise you personally about your rights, options or\nobligations as a class member in this lawsuit. If you want to be represented by\nyour own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.\n7.  What Does The Settlement Provide?\nThe Settlement provides for payment of a total of $12,000,000. From the\n$12,000,000, the following awards will be made:\na. An award of attorney’s fees and costs, in an amount not to exceed 1/3 of\nthe $12,000,000 total. (In addition, the Class Counsel may seek an award of the\ncosts of litigation, including the costs of this notice, of other aspects of the\nadministration of the class and of litigating the case before settlement.)\nb.Payment of $3,000,000 to be spent on District of Columbia programs and\n \nservices to fund changes necessary to eliminate the over-detentions and strips\nsearches that are the subject of this lawsuit. These funds will be for new programs\nor activities not previously budgeted (and specifically not as a part of the general\nbudget), and may include new staff, services, construction, technology, equipment,\nClass Notice – Bynum v. District of Columbia.; P.O. Box __________; Novato, Calif.\n94948-6177 47\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 48 of 78(cid:10)\nprograms or other activities otherwise necessary to meet the objective of the\nelimination of over-detentions and post-release strip searches. \nc.  Payment of a total not exceeding $200,000 to individuals who sought\nrepresentation from Class Counsel and whose individual damages could be\nassessed prior to settlement. These plaintiffs will receive more under the\nSettlement than other class members because of the role that they played in the\nlitigation, and because of individualized damages determinations made in their\ncases.\nd.  Payment of the remainder, estimated to be approximately in the range of\n$4,500,000 - $4,700,000, to the members of the class who file claims for payment,\nunder a formula that takes into account a variety of issues (such as the length of\nany over-detention for those over-detained, and the nature of the arrest offense,\nprior arrest history, the outcome of the arrest, and the like for those strip searched). \nThe settlement also requires the District of Columbia to release detainees or\ninmates within 24 hours of the time they become entitled to release, and the\nDistrict of Columbia will no longer strip search court returns who are entitled to\nrelease.\n8.  Will I Receive Anything From The Settlement?\nIf it is determined that you are a class member, and you file a claim within\nthe time set by the Court, you will be entitled to receive compensation.\nThe amount you will receive if you do file a claim depends on a variety of\nfactors, including whether and for how long you were over-detained, and, if you\nwere strip searched, whether this was a first offense or not, whether you were\ncharged or not, and the nature of the matter on which you were arrested. The full\ndescription of the proposed system to determine how this determination will be\nClass Notice – Bynum v. District of Columbia.; P.O.

All Claim Forms must be completed and postmarked (or delivered in\nhand) by no later than December 23, 2005, but it is recommended that you\ncomplete and mail your Claim Form as soon as possible. If you do not timely and\nproperly submit your Claim Form, you will not receive any money from the\nSettlement.

District of Columbia.; P.O. Box __________; Novato, Calif.\n94948-6177 49\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 128     Filed 08/31/2005     Page 50 of 78(cid:10)\n11.  How Much Will The Lawyers Be Paid?\nThe Court has not yet decided how much Plaintiffs' Counsel will be paid\n(attorney's fees). However, Plaintiffs' Counsel will ask the Court for an award of\nreasonable fees in the amount of 1/3 of the total award, i.e., $4,000,000 of the\n$12,000,000. The Court may award less than that amount, but not more. You will\nnot be asked personally to pay any Attorneys' Fees that the Court may award to\nClass Counsel.  Only if you hire your own lawyer to represent you personally\nwould you have to pay that attorney any fees.  In addition, the amount of other\nexpenses and costs incurred in pursuing this class action law suit will be paid from\nthe Settlement.  These expenses and costs are separate from and not included in\nthe amount of any attorney's fees.\n12. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement?\n  \nIf you do not want to be a member of the Class, or if you want to be able to\nfile your own lawsuit, or be part of a different lawsuit against the Defendant\nraising the claims involved in this lawsuit, then you must take steps to get out of\nthe Class. This is called \"excluding yourself\" and sometimes is referred to as\n\"opting out\" of the Class.\n13. What Do I Do To Exclude Myself From The Lawsuit?\n \nTo exclude yourself, you must send a letter by first-class mail clearly stating\nthat you want to be excluded from Bynum v. District of Columbia. Be sure to\ninclude your name, address, telephone number and signature. The name and\naddress of your attorney is not sufficient. You must mail your exclusion request,\npostmarked no later than December 23, 2005, to: \nBynum v. District of Columbia Settlement Administrator\nP.O. Box _______________\nClass Notice – Bynum v.

If you are excluded,\nyou will not be entitled to get any money from the settlement, and you cannot\nobject to the Settlement. Nor will you be legally bound by anything that happens\nin this lawsuit.\nUnless you exclude yourself, you give up all of your rights against the\nDefendant for the claims that are involved in this Settlement, even if you do not\nfile a claim and do not receive money. In exchange, you receive the benefits of this\nsettlement. \n14.  What Is The Release Of Claims?\nAs part of the Settlement, you release the claims covered by this lawsuit in\nexchange for the money you are entitled to receive if you do not exclude yourself\nfrom the class. The Proposed Final Order of Settlement (which you may view on\nthe website for this lawsuit at _______) describes the legal claims against the\nDefendants you give up by staying in the Class (that is, if you do not exclude\nyourself as described in the question above entitled \"What Do I Do To Exclude\nMyself From The Lawsuit?\"). The Released Claims include all claims, demands,\ncauses of action, whether class, individual or otherwise in nature, damages\nwhenever incurred, liabilities of any nature whatsoever, including costs, expenses,\npenalties and Attorneys' Fees, that were asserted in the complaint, specifically for\nthe over-detention and strip searches described earlier.

If I Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorneys' Fees, How Do I\n  \nTell The Court?\nIf you are and choose to remain a Class Member, you can object to the\nSettlement if you do not like any part of it, or you may object to the request for\nAttorneys' Fees. You must give the reason why you think that the Court should not\napprove the Settlement or the requested Attorneys' Fees (i.e., a mere statement that\n\"I object\" will not be sufficient). Do not contact the Court orally to object. Rather,\nyou must send a written statement with the case name and number (Bynum v.\nDistrict of Columbia, Case No. 02-956 (RCL) at the top of the page. In addition,\nprovide your name, your address (just giving the address of an attorney who\nrepresents you is not sufficient), your telephone number, the date of arrest to the\nextent known, your Driver’s License number, your Social Security number, your\nsignature and the reason why you object.

What Is The Difference Between Objecting And Excluding?\nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about\nthe Settlement. You can object only if you stay in the Class. If you object and the\nCourt rejects your objection, you remain a member of the Class and will be bound\nby any outcome of the case. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do not\nwant to be part of the Class. If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object\nbecause the case no longer affects you.\n17.

The Court has previously certified both an Overdetention Class and a Strip\nSearch Class under both Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).  This is a hybrid class\naction, certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) with regard to seeking injunctive\nrelief on over-detentions, and strip searches of inmates under the definition of the\nstrip search class set forth herein. Therefore, regarding prospective relief, no\nmember of the class may opt-out. With regards to monetary relief, the class is\ncertified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and class members have a right to opt out\nof the monetary relief stage.\n9. The Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as: \nEach person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District\n(a)\nof Columbia Department of Corrections facility beginning in the\nthree years preceding the filing of this action on or about May 16,\n2002 up to and until the date this case is terminated; and (b) who was\nnot released, or, in the future will not be released by midnight on the\nClass Notice – Bynum v.

The Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as: \nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this\naction, up until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or will be (i) in\nthe custody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a\nDepartment of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or\notherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court appearance\nbecause the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or\nwas dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own\nrecognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was\nacquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was returned to a\nDepartment of Corrections facility, to be processed out of Department of\nCorrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual\nbody cavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable or\nprobable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons; before being\nreleased, regardless of whether he was over-detained. \nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it\nends on August 31, 2005.\nClass-wide Prospective Relief \n3. The plaintiffs’ claims for prospective relief regarding the Overdetention and\nthe strip search classes have been resolved by the cessation of the practices of\nOverdetentions and strip-searching court returns entitled to release. No court order\nis entered under the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties on these\nissues. The parties agree that the injunctive relief objective of this agreement is the\nelimination of over-detentions and court release strip searches. To that end, the\nClass Notice – Bynum v.

Pursuant to F. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(g)(1)(C)(i), the Court considered the\nfollowing points in appointing class counsel: (1) the work counsel has done in\nidentifying or investigating potential claims in the action, (2) counsel's experience\nin handling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted\nin the action, based in part on affidavits submitted by counsel in support of their\nmotions to certify (3) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law, (4) the resources\ncounsel committed to representing the class; as well as other matters pertinent to\ncounsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.

How the\nfunds will be used and allocated is addressed below and in the Settlement\nAgreement.\n8. If no appeal or petition for U.S. Supreme Court review has been filed, then\nthe settlement funds will be paid on the timetable set forth in the preceding\nparagraph.

If the result of the appeal or Supreme Court review is that the settlement\nis not ultimately approved, then the case shall revert to active litigation, and the\nDistrict shall have no responsibility to pay any Settlement Funds not previously\npaid for the costs of class notice and related administrative expenses. \n9. The parties agreed that $3 million of the $12 million payment referenced\nabove will revert to the D.C.

The maximum number of points to be awarded for an\noverdetention is 180.

The Court approves the Named Plaintiffs Distribution – a total of no more\nthan $200,000 (exclusive of fees and costs). The Court concludes that this award\nis justified because the Named Plaintiffs made contributions to the class as a\nwhole, justifying awards to them higher than those to the general class. In\naddition, the Named Plaintiffs’ individualized damages claims, including special\ndamages, are a factor in the determination of the sum they receive. Such\ndeterminations cannot reasonably be made for class members in general without\nunduly consuming funds for administrative costs that will otherwise be available\nfor distribution to Class members. Any fees due Class Counsel for their\nrepresentation of the Named Plaintiffs is encompassed within the Class Fund\nAttorney’s Fees referenced herein. \nClass Fund Attorneys’ Fees\n13. The parties agreed that the settlement amount shall include all attorneys’ fees\nand costs, and that the Plaintiffs could seek up to 1/3 of the Settlement Funds of\n$12,000,000 as attorney’s fees (exclusive of costs).

Class Fund Attorneys’ Fees do not include the costs of\npursuing the lawsuit to resolution, the costs after settlement, and the payment of\nthe costs of Class Administration, which are the subject of a separate award of\ncosts. The Class Fund Attorneys’ Fees come to a total of $____. The costs\nawarded to date are $__. At the conclusion of the Class Administration, when\nfunds are ready to be distributed, the court will make a further award of costs to\ncover costs to date. Class Counsel are authorized to distribute up to $____ to the\nClass Administrator, Rosenthal & Co., for further class administrative costs,\nwithout further order of the court. The basis for the Court’s award is contained in a\nseparate order. To the extent there is any conflict between this paragraph and the\nseparate fee and costs order, the separate fee order controls. All of the foregoing\namounts are to be paid exclusively out of the Settlement Funds without additional\ncontribution or payment by any Defendant. \nClass Administrator\n14.

The Court approves the Allocation and Distribution Plan set forth herein, and\ndirects the Class Administrator to distribute the Class Fund in the manner\nprovided herein. \n16.  The Administrator shall scale the claims based upon the point system\ndescribed herein. The Administrator shall compute the number of points due to\neach Plaintiff, and divide each Plaintiff’s number of points into the total number of\npoints to determine each Plaintiff’s proportionate share of the Class Distribution.\nEach individual shall receive the highest point category for which s/he qualifies.\nTo limit the potential effect of multiple arrests and strip searches on the point\ncalculation, no person may receive more than 75 points for their total strip search\npoints. \n17. The meaning of each term used above is defined in the following paragraph.\n ? First Offender – The arrest at issue was the first arrest of the individual based\nupon the District of Columbia’ Records, including Superior Court records.\nIn the absence of a record showing a prior offense, the individual shall be\ntreated as a first offender.\n? Repeat Offender – The arrest at issue was not the first arrest of the individual\nbased upon the District of Columbia’ Records, including Superior Court\nrecords.\n? Violence – The matter on which the individual was arrested was an offense\nthat involved violence or weapons.\n? Prostitution – The matter on which the individual was arrested involved a\ncharge of prostitution.\n?

As used above, the term “arrest” refers to the most serious charge identifiable\nfrom a) the JACCS (Department of Corrections computerized inmate management\nsystem) database, and b) the Superior Court for the District of Columbia Database\n(the “CIS” database).\n19. Each Plaintiff’s points are to be based exclusively upon information obtained\nfrom the District of Columbia’s records (including the District of Columbia\nSuperior Court records). The total points will be divided into the available funds,\nso that a value per point is determined. Each Plaintiff will receive the value of his\nor her points, except no Plaintiff will receive less than $50.\n20.  Except for the deposit into the Settlement Funds required by this Order, the\nDistrict of Columbia will have no further obligations or duties or liability\nwhatsoever with respect to the Settlement Funds except with respect to the\nreversion amount used to fund the injunctive relief claims. The District of\nColumbia has expressly made a condition of this settlement that it has no\ninvolvement in the class distribution to Claimants. \n21. Plaintiffs will undertake all allocation and administrative responsibilities for\nthe settlement consistent with a reasonable and sound system of distribution that is\napproved by the Court.

This may require subsequent\ndistributions to class members who file claims if monies attempted to be\ndistributed remain undelivered. If, after all reasonable efforts to distribute the\nSettlement Funds to class members who have filed claims have been exhausted,\nand some residual amount still remains, that residual amount will revert to the \nDistrict of Columbia. \n22.

These funds may be\nspent on new staff, services, construction, technology, equipment, programs or\nother activities otherwise necessary to improve or assist in processing inmates for\nrelease and to reduce incidents of over-detention and the need to strip search,\nwithout individualized suspicion, inmates who meet the definition of the strip\nsearch class.

Amato, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Civil Litigation Division, Richard S. Love, Chief, Equity I, Civil\nLitigation Division, Equity Section I, George C. Valentine, Deputy Attorney General, Civil Litigation Division,\nWashington, DC, for District of Columbia.\nORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING SETTLEMENT, CLASS NOTICE\nAND NOTICE OF HEARING\nLAMBERTH, District Judge.\nUpon review and consideration of the Settlement Agreement and the exhibits attached thereto (the \"Settlement\nAgreement\") made and entered into on June 16, 2005, as amended June 22, 2005 and August 31, 2005,\nbetween the Named Plaintiffs in the above-captioned action (the \"Class Representatives\"), individually and as\nrepresentative of the classes certified by this Order, and the District of Columbia (\"Defendant\"),\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:\nPRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT\n1. This Order incorporates by reference the definitions in the Settlement Agreement, a copy of which is attached\n343 to *343 this Order, and also incorporates Exhibits C through E, as amended August 31, 2005, thereto. All terms\ndefined therein shall have the same meaning in this Order.\n2. The Settlement Agreement is hereby preliminarily approved, subject to further consideration thereof at the\nFairness Hearing provided for below. The Court finds that the settlement amount of $12,000,000.00 is within the\nrange such that final settlement approval may be appropriate, following notice to the Class and after\nconsideration of any objections. The Court preliminarily finds that the terms of the Settlement Agreement are\nwithin the range of what would constitute a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement in the best interests of the\nClass as a whole, and that the terms of the Settlement Agreement satisfy the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23\n(e) and due process requirements.\nDEADLINES FOR NOTICE, FILING OBJECTIONS AND OPT-OUTS, AND DATE OF FAIRNESS HEARING\n3. The Court has set the following dates for purposes of this class action\na.

However, the Court must approve any change of the date of the\nFinal Approval Hearing.\nCERTIFICATION OF OVERDETENTION CLASS AND STRIP SEARCH CLASS\n5. The Court has previously certified both an Overdetention Class and a Strip Search Class under both\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3). This is a hybrid class action, certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) with regard to\nseeking injunctive relief on over-detentions, and strip searches of inmates under the definition of the strip search\nclass set forth herein. Therefore, regarding prospective injunctive relief, no member of the class may opt-out.\n344 With regards to monetary relief, *344 the class is certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) and class members have a\nright to opt out of the monetary relief stage.\nThe Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:\n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of Corrections\nfacility beginning in the three years preceding the filing of this action on or about May 16, 2002 up to and until the\ndate this case is terminated; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future will not be released by midnight on\nthe date on which the person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her\ndetention has otherwise expired.\nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nThe Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:\nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is\nterminated, has been, is or will be (i) in the custody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a\nDepartment of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to release by\nvirtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was\ndismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to\ntime served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was returned to a Department of Corrections\nfacility, to be processed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (v) was subjected to a strip search and/or\nvisual body cavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable or probable cause that he was\nconcealing contraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was over-detained.\nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nCLASS-WIDE PROSPECTIVE RELIEF STRIP SEARCH CLASS\n\n6. The plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief regarding the strip search class will be resolved by the D.C.\nDepartment of Corrections' plan to divert inmates ordered released or otherwise entitled to release from the\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia to a secure location outside of the open population of the D.C. Jail or\nanother location where they will not be subject to a strip search, absent individualized suspicion, while the record\nreview for detainers and warrants and property retrieval are conducted prior to release. This process shall be\nimplemented on or before August 31, 2005. The Monetary Relief Strip Search Class will extend through that date.\n7. The parties will defer the initiation of class notice until after August 31, 2005.\n8. If the District has not accomplished the change in the strip search procedure by August 31, 2005, then any\npersons strip searched after that time will have a new claim for that subsequent search, which is not covered by\nthis settlement..\n9. In addition, the Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class and class counsel will be free at that point to pursue\nlitigation in this case to enjoin the District's continuing Strip Search policy, and the District will be free to oppose it.\nAny fees awarded to the class as prevailing parties for such litigation shall be separate from the Class Fund\nAttorney's Fees.\nCLASS REPRESENTATIVES\n10. Marcus Bynum, Kim Nabinette, Leroy S. Thomas, Dianne Johnson, Gloria Scarborough, and Julian Ford are\n345 hereby *345 confirmed as Class Representatives for the Class.\nCLASS COUNSEL\n11.

Thomas, Dianne Johnson, Gloria Scarborough, and Julian\nFord.\nThe Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:\n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of Corrections\nfacility beginning in the three years preceding the filing of this action on or about May 16, 2002 up to and until\nAugust 31, 2005; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future will not be released by midnight on the date on\nwhich the person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her detention\nhas otherwise expired.\nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nThe Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:\nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is\nterminated, has been, is or will be (i) in the custody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a\n349 Department of Corrections *349 facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to release\nby virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was\ndismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to\ntime served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was returned to the DC Jail or CTF from\ncourt, to be processed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or\nvisual body cavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable or probable cause that he was\nconcealing contraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was over-detained.\nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nIn the interest of avoiding expense, delay and inconvenience of further litigation of issues raised in this action, in\nthe absence of any admission of liability by defendant, and in reliance upon the representations contained herein,\nand in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and obligations in this Agreement, and for good and\nvaluable consideration, plaintiffs and defendant, through their undersigned counsel, agree and stipulate as\nfollows:\nI. Definitions and General Provisions\nA. Definitions\n\n.\"Class Administrator\" 00 A firm to be chosen by agreement of the parties, or appointment of the court if the parties\n97\ncannot agree, to administer the claims process. Any firm so chosen must specialize in such work.\n.\"Plaintiff class\" or \"Class Member(s)\" 00 All Class Members\n97\n.\"Named plaintiffs\" or \"Class Representatives\" 00 The original named plaintiffs in the Amended Complaint to this\n97\nsuit:\n.\"Claimant(s)\" 00 Class members who actually file claims pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Agreement.\n97\n.\"Class Fund or Class Settlement\" 00 Lump sum payment to be paid by the defendant, totaling $12,000,000,\n97\nwhich will be paid and/or distributed and allocated as further described in this Agreement.\n.\"Class Fund Attorneys' Fees\" 00 That portion of the Class Fund awarded as attorney's fees and costs to Class\n97\nCounsel. Litigation costs and the costs of class notice and administration shall constitute a separate cost and will\nbe paid separately from the attorney's fees. The amount of these fees, which will be determined by the Court, will\nbe paid from the portion of the Settlement Fund that is to be distributed to class members (as opposed to the\nreversion fund).\n.\"Defendant\" 00 The District of Columbia\n97\n.\"Department\" 00 The D.C. Department of Corrections.\n97\n.\"Fairness Hearing\" 00 The final hearing on the fairness of this Settlement in the District Court, at which the Court\n97\nwill determine whether to approve it.\n.\"Named Plaintiffs' Distribution\" 00 The amount of the Class Fund to be distributed to the Named Plaintiffs.\n97\n.\"Plaintiffs\" - As the term \"Plaintiffs\" is used in this document and Exhibit B (the Preliminary Approval Order), it\nrefers to all class members. In Exhibit D (the Final Approval Order), it refers to all class members who have not\nopted out.\n.\"Preliminary District Court approval\" 00 The date, following submission of this Settlement Agreement to the Court\n97\n350 by the parties but prior to the conduct of a Fairness Hearing, on which the Court grants *350 initial approval of the\nSettlement Agreement.\n.\"Final District Court approval\" 00 The date, following submission of this Settlement Agreement to the Court by the\n97\nparties, and after conduct of a Fairness Hearing, on which the District Court grants final approval of the\nSettlement Agreement.\n.\"Plaintiffs' counsel,\" \"Counsel for plaintiffs,\" or \"Class Counsel\" 00 The counsel of record for the plaintiff class.\n97\nThey are William Claiborne, Lynn Cunningham and Barrett Litt, Attorneys at Law.\n.\"Counsel for the parties\" 00 Counsel for plaintiffs and counsel for the defendant.\n97\nB. General Provisions\n1. This Settlement Agreement is not an order of the Court, but a contract, and all of its provisions are enforceable\nby the parties under contract law.\n2. This is a hybrid class action, certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) with regard to seeking injunctive relief on\nover-detention and strip searches of inmates under the definition of the strip search class set forth, supra.\nTherefore, regarding prospective injunctive relief, no member of the class may opt-out. With regards to monetary\nrelief, the class is certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) and class members have a right to opt out of the monetary\nrelief stage. The parties agree that the monetary relief shall compensate for all alleged violations of rights and all\nclaims and any other incidents of incarceration by the plaintiff class members that were or could have been\nbrought in this civil action under any theory of liability for any claims related to allegedly unlawful over-detentions\nand strip searches, except as to monetary damages for those class members who choose to opt out.\n\n3. This Settlement Agreement comprises the full and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the\nmatters discussed herein. This agreement incorporates and supersedes any other agreements. No\nrepresentations or inducements to compromise this action have been made, other than those recited in this\nAgreement.\nII. Class-wide Prospective Relief\nA. Strip Search Class\n1. The plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief regarding the strip search class will be resolved by the D.C.\nDepartment of Corrections' plan to divert inmates ordered released or otherwise entitled to release from the\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia to a secure location outside of the open population of the D.C. Jail or\nanother location where they will not be subject to a strip search, absent individualized suspicion, while the record\nreview for detainers and warrants and property retrieval are conducted prior to release. This process shall be\nimplemented on or before August 31, 2005. The Monetary Relief Strip Search Class will extend through that date.\n2. The parties will defer the initiation of class notice until after August 31, 2005.\n3. If the District has not accomplished the change in the strip search procedure by August 31, 2005, then any\npersons strip searched after that time will have a new claim for that subsequent search, which is not covered by\nthis settlement.\n351 *351 4. In addition, in the scenario set forth in paragraph 3 immediately above, the Strip Search Injunctive Relief\nClass and class counsel will be free at that point to pursue additional litigation in this case to enjoin the District's\ncontinuing Strip Search policy, and the District will be free to oppose it. Any fees awarded to the class as\nprevailing parties for such litigation shall be separate from the Class Fund Attorney's Fees.\n5. The parties note that the court has previously entered orders certifying both an Over-detention and Strip\nSearch class; that no material modifications have been made to that definition; that the court has made the\nfindings necessary to support the certification and no further findings are necessary in this regard; and that the\nClass Counsel listed above were appointed at that time as counsel for the class.\nB. Successors\nThe terms of the Agreement shall each be binding on the Plaintiffs and the District of Columbia, and their\nsuccessors and assigns, subject to the modification clause set forth in Section C, below.\nC. Modification as a Result of Changes in Applicable Law\nThe parties recognize that, following execution of this Agreement, there may be changes in controlling law that\nwarrant modification. The Settlement Agreement shall be subject to modification by the Court upon the\napplication of either party based on changes in applicable state or federal law after August 31, 2005, as it relates\nto injunctive relief. No modification shall apply as it relates to monetary relief.\nIII. Class-wide Monetary Relief\nA. Monetary Payments\n1. Within 45 days of the Final District Court approval of this settlement, the District will pay the sum of $12 million\n(\"the Settlement Funds\"), less the costs advanced by the District for preparation and publication of the Class\nNotice and related administrative expenses, which amount shall be deemed to be in exchange for a full and final\nrelease of all claims to be contained in the Final Order of Approval of Settlement. The payment will be such that\nthe funds will be deposited and cleared through the appropriate accounts within that 45-day period. How the\nfunds will be used and allocated is addressed in ¶¶ III(A)(3-6) below.\n2. If no appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States has been filed, then the\nsettlement funds will be paid on the timetable set forth in the preceding paragraph. If an appeal or a petition for\nwrit of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States has been filed, then the District shall distribute the\n\nSettlement Funds in accordance with the provisions of ¶¶ III(A)(3-6) below within 30 days of the date that all\nappellate avenues of review have been exhausted, including Supreme Court review, if the settlement is ultimately\napproved. If the result of the appeal or Supreme Court review is that the settlement is not ultimately approved,\nthen the case shall revert to active litigation, and the District shall have no responsibility to pay any Settlement\nFunds not previously paid for the costs of class notice and related administrative expenses.\n352 *352 3. The parties agree that $3 million of the $12 million payment referenced above will revert to the D.C.\nDepartment of Corrections to be spent on programs and services which relate to the subject of this complaint\n(hereafter \"reversion fund\"). These funds may be spent on new staff, services, construction, technology,\nequipment, programs or other activities otherwise necessary to improve or assist in processing inmates for\nrelease of inmates and to reduce incidents of over-detention and the need to strip search, without individualized\nsuspicion, inmates who meet the definition of the strip search class. It is understood that the reversion fund exists\nto fund the injunctive relief changes necessary to eliminate the over-detentions and strips searches that are the\nsubject of this lawsuit and will be for new programs or activities not previously budgeted (and specifically not as a\npart of the general budget). The mediators in the case will work with the parties to identify specifically how and\nwhen the reversionary amount will be spent. If, by August 31, 2005, the parties have been unable to agree\nspecifically how all of these funds will be spent, either side may submit its proposals to the Court, which will then\ndecide how to spend any amount not otherwise agreed to based on the criteria set forth above. This decision will\nbe binding and may not be appealed by either side.\n4. The parties agree that the injunctive relief objective of this agreement is the elimination of over-detentions and\ncourt release strip searches. To that end, the District will, for a period of two years, provide to Class Counsel\nannually a report on whether 1) it has strip searched any court returns entitled to release absent individualized\nreasonable suspicion to do so, and whether 2) it has released any detainees or inmates more than 24 hours after\nthe time they become entitled to release, and the reasons therefore.\n5. The parties agree that the settlement amount shall include all attorneys' fees and costs. Plaintiffs intend to\nsubmit a petition for attorneys' fees and costs to the Court for the sum of $4 million dollars. Defendant takes no\nposition regarding the Plaintiffs' petition for attorneys' fees and costs. If the Court awards less than $4 million for\nthe plaintiffs' attorneys' fees costs, the remainder of the $4 million shall revert to the District of Columbia on\nprograms and services that relate to the subject of this complaint, and shall be subject to the same terms as are\nset forth in ¶ III(A)(3) above.\n6. The parties agree that $5 million dollars of the settlement amount shall be used for the compensation of the\nplaintiffs and for the administration and distribution of the monetary compensation fund, including the claims\nverification procedure. The plaintiffs will develop a plan of distribution to address all of the plaintiffs' claims and\nthat plan shall be submitted to the Court for approval. The claims procedure shall include a verification process to\nensure that claimants are members of one or both classes, and the length of the claimants' over-detention. The\nClaims Administrator and Class Counsel will distribute this money according to the terms of the Final Order of\n353 Approval of Settlement. Plaintiffs shall use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the settlement *353\namount will occur in such a way so that no residual amount (of the $5 million compensation fund) will remain\nfollowing final distribution. However, if some residual happens to remain after reasonable efforts to distribute\nfunds to class members who have filed claims have been exhausted, the residual amount will revert to the\nreversion fund defined in ¶ III(A)(3) above.\nIV. Procedures for Approval of the Final Settlement Agreement\nA. Application for Preliminary Approval\nThe parties will apply for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement Agreement by June 16, 2005. At that time, the\nproposed Order of Final Approval of Settlement will be presented to the court. A hearing will be held within 30\ndays thereafter, at which time the court will make a preliminary determination that the settlement appears fair,\nadequate and just; determine whether it will approve the class notice; and set a date for the Fairness Hearing and\nany other dates that need to be determined.\nB. Notice to Potential Claimants\n\n1. Application for Preliminary District Court approval shall occur as soon as is practicable. However, since the\ndefinition of the Monetary Relief classes (both Over-detention and Strip Search) extends through August 31,\n2005, notice will be sent as soon as practicable after that date. At that time, a copy of the Notice (set forth in\nExhibit C) and the Claim Form (set forth in Exhibit D) shall be distributed to every person identified as a class\nmember.\n2. Plaintiffs will distribute the Notice and Claim Form by first class mail to the last known address of each class\nmember.\n3. The District will pay to the Class Administrator the costs of preparing and publishing the Class Notice and other\nexpenses related to the publication and distribution of notice to the class. The Class Administrator shall provide\nan estimate of the costs of notice no later than July 20, 2005, and the necessary funds shall be paid to the Class\nAdministrator no later than August 8, 2005, and supplemented in the event the Class Administrator provides a\nsupplemental estimate. Any such payments shall be credited against the $12 Million Class Settlement. However,\nif for any reason this settlement is not ultimately approved, the District shall have no claim against Plaintiffs, the\nClass or Class Counsel for reimbursement of the costs of notice and related costs for which it advanced funds,\nexcept to be credited in any subsequent settlement of this case.\n4. A modified and shortened form of the Class Notice shall be published by plaintiffs at least in the following\nnewspapers: Washington Post, Washington Times and the City Paper, as well as such regional newspapers as\nplaintiffs shall determine, in consultation with the Class Administrator, are reasonably necessary to provide notice\nto the class, not to exceed three regional newspapers, unless plaintiffs obtain consent from defendants, which\nshall not be unreasonably withheld, or approval from the court. The notice shall be published twice a week for two\n354 weeks, in the section of the newspaper ordinarily devoted to local news. Publication shall occur on at least *354\none Sunday for each newspaper with a Sunday edition.\n5. Defendant shall post the Notice on each Unit of the D.C. Jail and the Correctional Treatment Facility, along\nwith extra copies of the Claim Form. The Notice shall remain posted until the period for class members to return\nthe Claim Form has expired.\nC. Deadline for Submitting Claim Forms and to Opt Out\n1. The Class Notice shall advise Class Members that they must file a claim form or opt out by a date certain, or\nthey will nonetheless be bound by the settlement, which date will be at least 60 days from the time the initial\nnotices are sent out. Any class member wishing to pursue a claim must file a Claim Form by that date in order to\nparticipate in the Class Distribution. Claim forms must be postmarked or received in hand by that date. Any class\nmember wishing to opt out of this Settlement Agreement must similarly have either sent a an opt out letter\npostmarked, or delivered by hand, by that date.\nD. Submission of Materials Preliminary to the Fairness Hearing.\nWithin at least 15 days before the Fairness Hearing, Plaintiffs will file a report with the Court on the number of\nclaims received and the number of class members who have elected to opt out of the Settlement Agreement.\nE. Objections\nAny person who wishes to object to the terms of this Settlement Agreement will be required, not less than 30\ndays prior to the Fairness Hearing, to submit a written statement to the Court, with copies to counsel for the\nparties, setting forth his or her objections. The statement shall contain the individual's name, address and\ntelephone number, along with a statement of his or her objection(s) to the Settlement Agreement and the reason\n(s) for the objection(s). The parties shall file a response to any such objections at least 15 days prior to the\nFairness Hearing.\nF. Severability\n\nThe parties do not intend this Agreement to be severable; if it is not approved in its entirety, either side may\nwithdraw from it within 10 days of the court's determination that it will not accept the settlement agreement as is\nand the court's indication of the specific modifications to it, in which case this agreement will be null and void.\nV. Administrative Issues\n1. Plaintiffs, acting through Class Counsel and the Class Administrator, shall have sole responsibility for\ndetermining the class distribution formula, the weight to be given to various factors, and the proportionate\ndistribution between Over-detention and Strip Search Class members, for distribution of the monetary portion of\nthe settlement going to class members, subject to ultimate approval approved by the Court. The Defendant shall\ntake no position on these issues.\n355 2. The Distribution system that Plaintiffs will propose to the court will be a point system that will rely solely *355\non on the information obtained from the Defendant's (including Superior Court) records, as supplemented by\nCSOSA records, with the exception of the Named Plaintiffs.\n3. No later than July 30, 2005, the District of Columbia shall make available, to the extent that such information\nhas not already been provided, the name, address, social security number, date of birth and driver's license\ninformation of class members, to the extent it exists and is reasonably available from its records, to Class\nCounsel, to be forwarded to the Class Administrator in computerized form (to the extent it exists in computerized\nform), to facilitate locating class members. Such information shall be confidential, and may not be disclosed to\nanyone except counsel of record, the Class Administrator, and such representatives of the District of Columbia\nand, to the extent provided by court orders and agreement of counsel, counsel of record in Watson v. District of\nColumbia, Case No. 02-980 (GK-JMF). This information shall cover the class period until June 30, 2005. The\nperiod July 1 to August 31, 2005, shall be provided in a supplemental submission by no later than September 10,\n2005.\n4. Defendant shall make available to plaintiffs' counsel from the JACCS and CIS computer databases, and other\ndatabases, and paper records, information reasonably necessary for administration and verification of claims, to\nthe extent necessary and reasonably accessible.\n5. The Defendant undertakes to use reasonable efforts to assist Plaintiffs in obtaining from Court Services and\nOffender Supervision Agency (\"CSOSA\") prior to the deadline for sending notice, upon a written request from\nClass Counsel the most recent address, social security number, date of birth and driver's license information, to\nthe extent reasonably available, in computerized form, of the Class Members, so that the data can be provided to\nthe Class Administrator.\n6. Plaintiffs will use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the settlement amount will occur in such a way\nas to insure that no residual amount of money will remain following final distribution. This will likely include a\nsecond round of distribution to class members who have filed claims for amounts allocated to class members\nwho do file claims but then become unavailable. If some residual happens to remain after all reasonable efforts to\ndistribute funds to class members who have filed claims have been exhausted, stemming from the accrual of\ninterest, for example, this will revert to the reversion fund defined in ¶ III(A)(3) above.\n7. The reversion of any portion of the class fund to the District of Columbia does not affect the amount of the\nclass fund for purposes of determining the percentage of attorney's fees to be paid class counsel (see Definition\nof Class Fund Attorney's Fees, above) or the timing of that payment.\nVI. Non-admission\n356 The plaintiffs allege in their Amended Complaint that the Department has engaged *356 in a pattern and practice\nof over-detention and unlawful strip searching. Defendant denies those allegations. Entry of the Agreement does\nnot operate as an admission of liability by the D.C. Department of Corrections or the District of Columbia of\nPlaintiffs' allegations.\nVII. Amendments\n\nWith the consent of the parties, additional provisions may be added to this Settlement Agreement if needed to\nassure appropriate implementation and court approval.\nSigned and Agreed to by:\nROBERT J.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, ET AL., CASE NO. 02-956\n(RCL).\nTHIS CLASS AND SETTLEMENT NOTICE IS AVAILABLE IN SPANISH. CALL TOLL-FREE: ________. IF,\nBETWEEN THE DATES OF MAY 16, 1999, AND AUGUST 31, 2005, YOU WERE IN ANY DISTRICT OF\nCOLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS FACILITY, AND EITHER 1) YOU WERE NOT RELEASED BY\nMIDNIGHT OF THE DAY YOU BECAME ENTITLED TO RELEASE BY COURT ORDER OR EXPIRATION OF\nSENTENCE, OR 2) YOU APPEARED IN COURT AND THE JUDGE ORDERED YOU RELEASED, AND THERE\nWAS NO OTHER REASON FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO DETAIN YOU, BUT YOU WERE STRIP\nSEARCHED BEFORE YOUR RELEASE,\nYOU MAY BE A CLASS MEMBER AND ENTITLED TO MONEY.\nThere is currently pending a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court, District of Columbia. The\nCourt has certified the case as a class action. If the proposed settlement receives final court approval, CLASS\nMEMBERS are eligible to receive money.\nDistrict of Columbia records show that you may be a CLASS MEMBER. Therefore, you may be eligible to receive\nMONEY. To receive any money in this pending settlement, you must fill out and mail a Claim Form.\nYour Claim Form must be postmarked or delivered in hand no later than December 23, 2005.\n\nIf you wish to \"opt-out,\" or be excluded from the settlement, your opt-out letter must be postmarked or delivered\nin hand by December 23, 2005.\nEven if you do not submit a claim form(s) or opt out by the above deadline, you will nonetheless be bound by the\nsettlement.\nIf You Wish to Claim Money, Fill out and Mail the Enclosed Claim Form\nToday.\nIf you receive more than one claim form, sign and file all claim forms you receive.\nBelow is a series of questions and answers designed to explain to you information about this lawsuit, including\nhow to proceed to file a claim or otherwise participate in the settlement process.\n1. What Is The Class Action Lawsuit About?\nThis lawsuit involves the alleged policy and/or practice of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections of\neither (1) holding inmates an unreasonable time after their release dates, or (2) strip searching inmates after they\nappeared in court and became entitled to release.\n2. Who Is A Member Of The Class?\nYou are a member of the class if you meet the class definition (summarized above and set forth fully in the\njudge's orders) and your claim can be verified from the records of the District of Columbia (including the records\nof the Superior Court of the District of Columbia).\nThe District of Columbia or the Superior Court of the District of Columbia must have a record of your being in\ncustody such that officials can identify you individually by true name and other methods of identification and\nascertain that you qualify as someone who was either detained too long or strip searched after having become\nentitled to release. Such records are the final determinant of who qualifies as a member of the class.\n358 *358 3. What Is The Purpose Of This Notice?\nYou have a right to know about a proposed Settlement of this class action lawsuit and about all of your options\nbefore the Court decides whether to give final approval to the Settlement. Your rights may be affected by this\nlawsuit.\nThis information is being sent to everyone who is or may be a member of the class based upon the last known\naddress available from the records of the District of Columbia, and otherwise publicized to reach class members.\nThis Notice explains the lawsuit, the Settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are obtained, who is eligible and\nhow to file a claim.\nThe Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The case is known\nas Bynum v. District of Columbia, et al., Case No. 02-956(RCL). The people who brought the case are called\nPlaintiffs, and the people they sued are called Defendants.\n4. Why Is This A Class Action?\nIn a class action, one or more person(s), called the Class Representative(s), sue on behalf of a group of people\nwho have similar claims 00 the class members. One court then resolves the issues for all class members, except\n97\nfor those who exclude themselves from the class.\n5. Why Is There A Settlement?\nAlthough the Court has not decided whether the claims in this lawsuit are correct, both sides have agreed to a\nSettlement. That way, both sides are able to avoid the risks and costs of a trial, the case can be resolved and the\n\nbenefits of the Settlement can be made immediately available to the Class Members. The Class Representatives\nand their attorneys think that the proposed Settlement is fair to the Class Members and the parties in the case\nand think that the terms of the Settlement are a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of this matter.\n6. Are There Lawyers Representing You?\nThe Court has approved three lawyers (called \"Class Counsel\") to collectively represent you. You will not be\nasked to pay your own personal money for the services of these attorneys and their associates and staff in\nlitigating this case and negotiating this Settlement. Instead, the lawyers will seek payment from the fund obtained\non behalf of the class, as is described further below. Only class counsel may act on behalf of the class. However,\nthat does not prevent you from hiring your own lawyer to advise you personally about your rights, options or\nobligations as a class member in this lawsuit. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may hire\none at your own expense.\n7. What Does The Settlement Provide?\nThe Settlement provides for payment of a total of $12,000,000. From the $12,000,000, the following awards will\nbe made:\na. An award of attorney's fees and costs, in an amount not to exceed 1/3 of the $12,000,000 total. (In addition,\nthe Class Counsel may seek an award of the costs of litigation, including the costs of this notice, of other aspects\nof the administration of the class and of litigating the case before settlement.)\nb. Payment of $3,000,000 to be spent on District of Columbia programs and services to fund changes necessary\nto eliminate the over-detentions and strips searches that are the subject of this lawsuit. These funds will be for\n359 new programs or activities not previously budgeted *359 ( and specifically not as a part of the general budget),\nand may include new staff, services, construction, technology, equipment, programs or other activities otherwise\nnecessary to meet the objective of the elimination of over-detentions and post-release strip searches.\nc. Payment of a total not exceeding $200,000 to individuals who sought representation from Class Counsel and\nwhose individual damages could be assessed prior to settlement. These plaintiffs will receive more under the\nSettlement than other class members because of the role that they played in the litigation, and because of\nindividualized damages determinations made in their cases.\nd. Payment of the remainder, estimated to be approximately in the range of $4,500,000 00 $4,700,000, to the\n97\nmembers of the class who file claims for payment, under a formula that takes into account a variety of issues\n(such as the length of any over-detention for those over-detained, and the nature of the arrest offense, prior\narrest history, the outcome of the arrest, and the like for those strip searched).\nThe settlement also requires the District of Columbia to release detainees or inmates within 24 hours of the time\nthey become entitled to release, and the District of Columbia will no longer strip search court returns who are\nentitled to release.\n8. Will I Receive Anything From The Settlement?\nIf it is determined that you are a class member, and you file a claim within the time set by the Court, you will be\nentitled to receive compensation.\nThe amount you will receive if you do file a claim depends on a variety of factors, including whether and for how\nlong you were over-detained, and, if you were strip searched, whether this was a first offense or not, whether you\nwere charged or not, and the nature of the matter on which you were arrested. The full description of the\nproposed system to determine how this determination will be made is contained in the Proposed Final Order of\nSettlement, which is contained on our website (_____________).\n9. What Do I Do To Get Money?\nIf you wish to receive money from the Settlement, you must complete and submit the accompanying Claim Form.\nRead the instructions on the Claim Form carefully. All Claim Forms must be completed and postmarked (or\n\ndelivered in hand) by no later than December 23, 2005, but it is recommended that you complete and mail your\nClaim Form as soon as possible. If you do not timely and properly submit your Claim Form, you will not receive\nany money from the Settlement. If you need a copy of a Claim Form, please call 1-_____________ (toll free), or\nwrite to the Bynum v. District of Columbia Settlement Administrator, P.O. Box __________________, Novato,\nCalif.

District of Columbia Settlement Administrator\nP.O. Box ___________________\nNovato, Calif. XXXXX-XXXX\nDeterminations of whether you are or are not a class member will be based exclusively on records of the District\nof Columbia (including the records of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia), and/or law enforcement\nrecords.\n360 *360 11. How Much Will The Lawyers Be Paid?\nThe Court has not yet decided how much Plaintiffs' Counsel will be paid (attorney's fees). However, Plaintiffs'\nCounsel will ask the Court for an award of reasonable fees in the amount of 1/3 of the total award, i.e.,\n$4,000,000 of the $12,000,000. The Court may award less than that amount, but not more. You will not be asked\npersonally to pay any Attorneys' Fees that the Court may award to Class Counsel. Only if you hire your own\nlawyer to represent you personally would you have to pay that attorney any fees. In addition, the amount of other\nexpenses and costs incurred in pursuing this class action law suit will be paid from the Settlement. These\nexpenses and costs are separate from and not included in the amount of any attorney's fees.\n12. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement?\nIf you do not want to be a member of the Class, or if you want to be able to file your own lawsuit, or be part of a\ndifferent lawsuit against the Defendant raising the claims involved in this lawsuit, then you must take steps to get\nout of the Class. This is called \"excluding yourself\" and sometimes is referred to as \"opting out\" of the Class.\n13. What Do I Do To Exclude Myself From The Lawsuit?\nTo exclude yourself, you must send a letter by first-class mail clearly stating that you want to be excluded from \nBynum v. District of Columbia. Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number and signature. The\nname and address of your attorney is not sufficient. You must mail your exclusion request, postmarked no later\nthan December 23, 2005, to:\nBynum v. District of Columbia Settlement Administrator\nP.O. Box __________________\nNovato, Calif. XXXXX-XXXX\nYou cannot exclude yourself on the phone or by email. If you are excluded, you will not be entitled to get any\nmoney from the settlement, and you cannot object to the Settlement. Nor will you be legally bound by anything\nthat happens in this lawsuit.\nUnless you exclude yourself, you give up all of your rights against the Defendant for the claims that are involved\nin this Settlement, even if you do not file a claim and do not receive money. In exchange, you receive the benefits\nof this settlement.\n14. What Is The Release Of Claims?\n\nAs part of the Settlement, you release the claims covered by this lawsuit in exchange for the money you are\nentitled to receive if you do not exclude yourself from the class. The Proposed Final Order of Settlement (which\nyou may view on the website for this lawsuit at _________) describes the legal claims against the Defendants\nyou give up by staying in the Class (that is, if you do not exclude yourself as described in the question above\nentitled \"What Do I Do To Exclude Myself From The Lawsuit?\"). The Released Claims include all claims,\ndemands, causes of action, whether class, individual or otherwise in nature, damages whenever incurred,\nliabilities of any nature whatsoever, including costs, expenses, penalties and Attorneys' Fees, that were asserted\nin the complaint, specifically for the over-detention and strip searches described earlier. These Released Claims\ninclude any other related complaints, grievances, and/or claims, whether judicial or administrative, and whether\n361 actually filed or available. Released Claims do not include any other claim(s) that a Plaintiff or member of the \n*361 Settlement Class may have against the District of Columbia for conduct not covered by this settlement, for\nexample, a false arrest or battery by a police officer.\n15. If I Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorneys' Fees, How Do I Tell The Court?\nIf you are and choose to remain a Class Member, you can object to the Settlement if you do not like any part of it,\nor you may object to the request for Attorneys' Fees. You must give the reason why you think that the Court\nshould not approve the Settlement or the requested Attorneys' Fees (i.e., a mere statement that \"I object\" will not\nbe sufficient). Do not contact the Court orally to object. Rather, you must send a written statement with the case\nname and number (Bynum v. District Of Columbia, Case No. 02-956(RCL)) at the top of the page. In addition,\nprovide your name, your address (just giving the address of an attorney who represents you is not sufficient),\nyour telephone number, the date of arrest to the extent known, your Driver's License number, your Social\nSecurity number, your signature and the reason why you object. If you are represented by a lawyer, you should\nalso give the name, address and telephone number of that lawyer. You must mail your objections and any\nsupporting papers by first-class mail, postmarked no later than December 23, 2005, to:\nClerk of the District Court United States District Court 333 Constitution Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20001\nCopies must be submitted to: William Claiborne Suite 210 717 D Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20004 and to:\nMaria Amato Senior Assistant Attorney General For the District of Columbia Equity I, Civil Litigation Division 441\n4th Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20001\nSubmitting an objection will not extend the time within which a Class Member may request exclusion from this\nSettlement.\nA full set of the settlement documents, including the Proposed Final Order of Settlement and the Motion For\nAward of Attorney's Fees and Costs is available (or will be if the motion for attorney's fees has not yet been filed)\non the case website, ________________.\n16. What Is The Difference Between Objecting And Excluding?\nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the Settlement. You can object only if\nyou stay in the Class. If you object and the Court rejects your objection, you remain a member of the Class and\nwill be bound by any outcome of the case. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do not want to be part\nof the Class. If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you.\n17. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The Settlement And Attorneys' Fees?\nThe Court has scheduled the Fairness Hearing for 10:00 A.M. on February 7, 2006, in the United States District\nCourthouse for the District of Columbia, 33 Constitution Ave., Washington D.C. 20001, in Judge Lamberth's\nCourtroom, Room ____, ____ Floor. At this Hearing, Judge Lamberth will consider whether the Settlement is fair,\nreasonable and adequate and the amount of Attorneys' Fees and costs to be awarded. If there are any\n362 objections, the *362 Court will consider them. After the Hearing, the Court will issue its ruling. We do not know\nhow long this process will take. We do not know if the hearing will be further continued, and there will not be a\nnew notice if it is. You may speak at the Hearing but only if you have submitted your comments or objections as\nprovided in the question above entitled \"If I Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorney's Fees, How\nDo I Tell The Court?\"\n\n18. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing?\nNo. You may, but need not, attend the Hearing. Plaintiffs' Counsel will answer any questions the Court may have.\nHowever, you may come if you choose, at your own expense. If you sent a written objection, you do not have to\ncome to Court to talk about it. As long as you properly submitted your written objection, the Court will consider it.\nYou may also pay your own lawyer to attend, but it is not necessary.\n19. May I Speak At The Hearing?\nYou will not be heard unless you have submitted your comments or objections as provided in the question above\nentitled \"If I Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorney's Fees, How Do I Tell The Court?\" and have\nstated in your submission that you wish to be heard. You cannot speak at the Hearing if you exclude yourself.\n20. What Happens If I Do Nothing At All?\nIf you take no action, your rights will be affected. You will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and you will be\nagreeing to a release of the claims that are contained in the Settlement. However, because you did not file a\nclaim, you will not be entitled to any money from the settlement.\n21. When Will I Receive Money From the Settlement?\nNo money will be paid until after the Settlement Funds are deposited with the Class Administrator, and until after\nthe date set by the Court as the last day to mail or file a claim. After that, it will take at least two months, and quite\npossibly more, to process all the claims, calculate the amount due to each class member and receive the money\nto send to the class members. If you file a claim and do not receive money within six months after December 23,\n2005, which is the last day to mail or file a claim, contact the Class Administrator by either calling 1-\n____________________ or writing to:\nBynum v. District of Columbia Settlement Administrator\nP.O. Box __________________\nNovato, Calif. XXXXX-XXXX\nWe strongly recommend that you keep a copy of your claim form. You may want to send the form in by certified\nmail so it can be verified, but you are not required to do so.\n22. Are There More Details About The Settlement?\nThis Notice merely summarizes the proposed Settlement. You may go to the website titled ______________ to\nsee the complete settlement documents in the case, or a copy of the Motion for Award of Attorney's Fees and\nCosts when it is filed. In the event that any description in this notice of the terms in the settlement documents\nconflict with the actual terms of the settlement documents, the terms of the settlement documents control.\n363  Exhibit D\n*363\nBynum v.

There have been a combined total of _____ objections to the settlement and/or the Motion for an award of\nattorneys' fees filed. The Court addresses those objections in separate orders. In sum the court concluded\n___________________________________ [insert discussion of objections, if any, after review].\nSettlement Agreement approved because fair, adequate, and reasonable\n7. The settlement of this Lawsuit was not the product of collusion between Plaintiffs and Defendant or their\nrespective counsel, but rather was the result of bona fide and arm's-length negotiation conducted in good faith by\n365 the Parties and their *365 counsel through the United States District Court Mediation Program administered by\nthe Office of the Circuit Executive for the United States Courts for the District of Columbia Circuit, pursuant to\nLCvR 84. The Settlement Agreement and the settlement set forth therein are hereby approved and found to be\nfair, adequate, reasonable, in the best interest of the Class as a whole, and in satisfaction of Rule 23 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process requirements.\nClass certified under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3)\n8. The Court has previously certified both an Overdetention Class and a Strip Search Class under both\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3). This is a hybrid class action, certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) with regard to\nseeking injunctive relief on over-detentions, and strip searches of inmates under the definition of the strip search\nclass set forth herein. Therefore, regarding prospective relief, no member of the class may opt-out. With regards\nto monetary relief, the class is certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) and class members have a right to opt out of\nthe monetary relief stage.\n9. The Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:\n\n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of Corrections\nfacility beginning in the three years preceding the filing of this action on or about May 16, 2002 up to and until the\ndate this case is terminated; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future will not be released by midnight on\nthe date on which the person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her\ndetention has otherwise expired.\nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it ends on August 31, 2005.\n2. The Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:\nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this action, up until the date this case is\nterminated, has been, is or will be (i) in the custody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a\nDepartment of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to release by\nvirtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was\ndismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to\ntime served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was returned to a Department of Corrections\nfacility, to be processed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or\nvisual body cavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable or probable cause that he was\nconcealing contraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was over-detained.\nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nClass-wide Prospective Relief\n3. The plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief regarding the Overdetention and the strip search classes have been\nresolved by the cessation of the practices of Overdetentions and strip-searching court returns entitled to release.\nNo court order is entered under the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties on these issues. The\n366 parties agree that the injunctive relief objective of this agreement is the elimination of over-detentions and *366\ncourt release strip searches. To that end, the District will, for a period of two years, provide to Class Counsel\nannually a report on whether 1) it has strip searched any court returns entitled to release absent individualized\nreasonable suspicion to do so, and whether 2) it has released any detainees or inmates more than 24 hours after\nthe time they become entitled to release, and the reasons therefore.\nClass Counsel\n4. The Court reaffirms the appointment of William Claiborne, Lynn Cunningham and Barrett S. Litt as Class\nCounsel, and, based upon the work that has occurred between the Preliminary Approval Order and the present,\nreaffirms the findings it made at the time of the Preliminary Approval Order confirming or appointing them.\n5. Pursuant to F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(g)(1)(C)(i), the Court considered the following points in appointing class\ncounsel: (1) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action, (2) counsel's\nexperience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted in the action, based\nin part on affidavits submitted by counsel in support of their motions to certify (3) counsel's knowledge of the\napplicable law, (4) the resources counsel committed to representing the class; as well as other matters pertinent\nto counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. The Court finds that Plaintiffs'\ncounsel have done extensive research in this case, including taking numerous depositions and affidavits and\ninterviewing numerous persons who have knowledge of the case, and thoroughly analyzing the computer records\nof the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs' counsel are competent to represent the members of the class.\nPayment by the District of Columbia\n6. As set forth in more detail in the Settlement Agreement, the District of Columbia agreed to pay a total of Twelve\nMillion Dollars ($12,000,000) in settlement of this Lawsuit. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, the\nDistrict of Columbia previously deposited $_________ (________ Thousand Dollars) into the Class Fund to fund\nthe cost of class notice and related matters.\n\n7. Within 45 days of the Final District Court approval of this settlement, after the time for all appeals and petition\nfor writ of certiorari filed with the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the Court approval of the settlement has\nlapsed, the District will pay the sum of $12 million (\"the Settlement Funds\"), less the costs advanced by the\nDistrict for preparation and publication of the Class Notice and related administrative expenses, which amount\nshall be deemed to be in exchange for a full and final release of all claims to be contained in the Final Order of\nApproval of Settlement. The payment will be such that the funds will be deposited and cleared through the\nappropriate accounts within that 45-day period. How the funds will be used and allocated is addressed below and\nin the Settlement Agreement.\n8. If no appeal or petition for U.S. Supreme Court review has been filed, then the settlement funds will be paid on\nthe timetable set forth in the preceding paragraph. If an appeal or petition for writ of certiorari has been filed, then\nthe District shall distribute the Settlement Funds in accordance with the provisions below within 30 days of the\ndate that all appellate avenues of review (including Supreme Court review) have been exhausted if the settlement\nis ultimately approved. If the result of the appeal or Supreme Court review is that the settlement is not ultimately\n367 approved, then the case shall revert *367 to active litigation, and the District shall have no responsibility to pay\nany Settlement Funds not previously paid for the costs of class notice and related administrative expenses.\n9. The parties agreed that $3 million of the $12 million payment referenced above will revert to the D.C.\nDepartment of Corrections to be spent on programs and services which relate to the subject of this complaint\n(hereafter \"reversion fund\"). The standards and allocations for the reversion fund are addressed further in ¶ _, \ninfra.\n10. The parties agreed that $5 million dollars of the settlement amount would be used for the compensation of the\nplaintiffs and for the administration and distribution of the monetary compensation fund, including the claims\nverification procedure. The cost of class notice and administration, any costs awarded, and the Named Plaintiffs'\nDistribution, all addressed elsewhere in this Order, will be paid from this fund. The remainder will be distributed to\nthe Class Members who file claim forms according to the following formula:\na. Overdetentions will receive one point per day for the first two days of overdetention and one point for each\nadditional two days or partial days of overdetention. The maximum number of points to be awarded for an\noverdetention is 180. Determination of days of overdetention is based solely on the Defendant's records as\ninterpreted by Plaintiffs' experts and the Class Administrator (including as adjusted based on jackets for those\nwhose jackets are available and may be examined by Plaintiffs).\nb. Strip searches will be valued based on the following formula, which will be determined solely on the basis of\nthe Defendant's records as interpreted by Plaintiffs' experts and the Class Administrator:\ni. Anyone who went to trial and was acquitted: 30 points.\nii. First Offenders not charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 25 points\niii. Repeat offenders not charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 15 points.\niv. First Offenders charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 10 points.\nv. Repeat offenders charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 5 points.\nvi. Women in categories i-ii above will receive an additional 20 points. Women in categories iii-iv will receive an\nadditional 10 points.\nc. Despite the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, no person who files and qualifies for a claim will be paid\nless than $50 for the combination of overdetentions and strip searches, and the final distribution formula will be\nadjusted accordingly.\n11. Plaintiffs shall use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the settlement amount will occur in such a\nway so that no residual amount of the $5 million compensation fund will remain following final distribution. Thus,\nto the extent that checks are written to class claimants and not cashed within six months of mailing, the amount\n\nremaining will be mailed in a second round of distribution to those class members who did both file claims and\ncash the checks sent to them. Thereafter, if some residual still remains, that residual amount will revert to the\nreversion fund discussed above.\n368 *368Named Plaintiffs' Distribution\n12. The Court approves the Named Plaintiffs Distribution 00 a total of no more than $200,000 (exclusive of fees\n97\nand costs). The Court concludes that this award is justified because the Named Plaintiffs made contributions to\nthe class as a whole, justifying awards to them higher than those to the general class. In addition, the Named\nPlaintiffs' individualized damages claims, including special damages, are a factor in the determination of the sum\nthey receive. Such determinations cannot reasonably be made for class members in general without unduly\nconsuming funds for administrative costs that will otherwise be available for distribution to Class members. Any\nfees due Class Counsel for their representation of the Named Plaintiffs is encompassed within the Class Fund\nAttorney's Fees referenced herein.\nClass Fund Attorneys' Fees\n13. The parties agreed that the settlement amount shall include all attorneys' fees and costs, and that the\nPlaintiffs could seek up to 1/3 of the Settlement Funds of $12,000,000 as attorney's fees (exclusive of costs). The\nCourt awards Class Counsel ___ % of the $12,000,000 Settlement Funds as Class Fund Attorneys' Fees, to be\nallocated among the lawyers who worked on the case by agreement between Class Counsel, as well as costs,\ndisbursements, and expenses, with interest from the date of the deposit of the Settlement Funds at the same rate\nearned by the Class Fund. Class Fund Attorneys' Fees do not include the costs of pursuing the lawsuit to\nresolution, the costs after settlement, and the payment of the costs of Class Administration, which are the subject\nof a separate award of costs. The Class Fund Attorneys' Fees come to a total of $_____. The costs awarded to\ndate are $___. At the conclusion of the Class Administration, when funds are ready to be distributed, the court will\nmake a further award of costs to cover costs to date. Class Counsel are authorized to distribute up to $_____ to\nthe Class Administrator, Rosenthal & Co., for further class administrative costs, without further order of the court.\nThe basis for the Court's award is contained in a separate order. To the extent there is any conflict between this\nparagraph and the separate fee and costs order, the separate fee order controls. All of the foregoing amounts are\nto be paid exclusively out of the Settlement Funds without additional contribution or payment by any Defendant.\nClass Administrator\n14. The Court reaffirms the appointment of Rosenthal & Company as Class Administrator.\nAllocation and Distribution Plan\n15. The Court approves the Allocation and Distribution Plan set forth herein, and directs the Class Administrator\nto distribute the Class Fund in the manner provided herein.\n16. The Administrator shall scale the claims based upon the point system described herein. The Administrator\nshall compute the number of points due to each Plaintiff, and divide each Plaintiff's number of points into the total\nnumber of points to determine each Plaintiff's proportionate share of the Class Distribution. Each individual shall\nreceive the highest point category for which s/he qualifies. To limit the potential effect of multiple arrests and strip\nsearches on the point calculation, no person may receive more than 75 points for their total strip search points.\n17. The meaning of each term used above is defined in the following paragraph.\n369 ? First Offender 00 The arrest at issue was the first arrest of the individual based upon the District of Columbia' \n97\n*369 Records, including Superior Court records. In the absence of a record showing a prior offense, the individual\nshall be treated as a first offender.\n? Repeat Offender 00 The arrest at issue was not the first arrest of the individual based upon the District of\n97\nColumbia' Records, including Superior Court records.\n? Violence 00 The matter on which the individual was arrested was an offense that involved violence or weapons.\n97\n\n? Prostitution 00 The matter on which the individual was arrested involved a charge of prostitution.\n97\n? Drugs 00 The matter on which the individual was arrested involved possession and/or sale of drugs.\n97\n18. As used above, the term \"arrest\" refers to the most serious charge identifiable from a) the JACCS\n(Department of Corrections computerized inmate management system) database, and b) the Superior Court for\nthe District of Columbia Database (the \"CIS\" database).\n19. Each Plaintiff's points are to be based exclusively upon information obtained from the District of Columbia's\nrecords (including the District of Columbia Superior Court records). The total points will be divided into the\navailable funds, so that a value per point is determined. Each Plaintiff will receive the value of his or her points,\nexcept no Plaintiff will receive less than $50.\n20. Except for the deposit into the Settlement Funds required by this Order, the District of Columbia will have no\nfurther obligations or duties or liability whatsoever with respect to the Settlement Funds except with respect to the\nreversion amount used to fund the injunctive relief claims. The District of Columbia has expressly made a\ncondition of this settlement that it has no involvement in the class distribution to Claimants.\n21. Plaintiffs will undertake all allocation and administrative responsibilities for the settlement consistent with a\nreasonable and sound system of distribution that is approved by the Court. The Class Administrator shall use its\nbest efforts to distribute the settlement amount in such a way as to insure that no residual amount of money will\nremain following final distribution. This may require subsequent distributions to class members who file claims if\nmonies attempted to be distributed remain undelivered. If, after all reasonable efforts to distribute the Settlement\nFunds to class members who have filed claims have been exhausted, and some residual amount still remains,\nthat residual amount will revert to the District of Columbia.\n22. At the conclusion of the Class Distribution, the Class Administrator and/or Class Counsel shall submit a report\nto the court summarizing the payments made to the Class, and seeking any final administrative costs to be\napproved.\n23. Plaintiffs requested injunctive relief as part of the complaint. The parties agreed that $3 million of the $12\nmillion payment referenced above would revert to the D.C. Department of Corrections to be spent on programs\nand services which relate to the subject of this complaint (the \"reversion fund\"). These funds may be spent on\nnew staff, services, construction, technology, equipment, programs or other activities otherwise necessary to\nimprove or assist in processing inmates for release and to reduce incidents of over-detention and the need to\nstrip search, without individualized suspicion, inmates who meet the definition of the strip search class. The\nreversion fund exists to fund the injunctive relief changes necessary to eliminate the over-detentions and strips\n370 searches that are the subject of this lawsuit and will be for new programs or activities not previously *370\nbudgeted (and specifically not as a part of the general budget).\n24. The reversion funds shall be spent as follows:\nThe parties will insert by 9-30-05 pursuant to mutual agreement, or the matter will be submitted to the court.\n[INSERT]\n25. Except as otherwise provided in this Order, each party shall bear its own costs, expenses and attorneys' fees.\n26.

The Court reserves and maintains jurisdiction over this settlement and its provisions, and over the claims\nadministration and distribution of the funds. Disagreements between the parties on any disputes or unresolved\naspects of this Order shall be subject to mediation before the mediator who has mediated this case to date. If\nmediation is not successful, the matter shall be brought to this Court for resolution.\n\n28. The Class Administrator shall distribute the funds within 90 days of either the last day to file a claim form, or\nthe time that the settlement funds are deposited with the Class Administrator, whichever is later. The Class\nAdministrator may have an additional period of time not to exceed 90 days upon the filing of a declaration with\nthe court setting forth the additional time needed and the reasons therefore. The Class Administrator shall file a\nfinal report within 60 days after the conclusion of the Distribution regarding the Class Distribution for which it is\nresponsible under this Order.\n29. The monetary relief provided for in the Settlement Agreement shall compensate for all alleged violations of\nrights and all claims and any other incidents of incarceration by the plaintiff class members that were or could\nhave been brought in this civil action under any theory of liability for any claims related to allegedly unlawful over-\ndetentions and strip searches, except as to monetary damages for those class members who choose to opt out.\n30. The Court hereby dismisses the Lawsuit on the merits, with prejudice, and without costs, with such dismissal\nsubject only to compliance by the Parties with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement and this\nFinal Order of Approval of Settlement.\n31. Plaintiffs are hereby severally and permanently barred and enjoined, to the fullest extent permitted by law,\nfrom filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, prosecuting or participating in a lawsuit or any other proceeding\nagainst District of Columbia involving or based on any of the claims that were brought or that could have been\nbrought in the Lawsuit, either directly or indirectly, representatively, derivatively, or in any other capacity, or that\nare otherwise encompassed within the Settlement agreement.\n32. Plaintiffs have not relied upon the advice of Class Counsel as to the legal and/or tax consequences of this\nsettlement, the payment of any money by the District of Columbia or the distribution of the Settlement Funds.\n33. Neither this Final Order of Approval of Settlement, the Settlement Agreement, nor any of its terms or the\nnegotiations or papers related thereto shall constitute evidence or an admission by the Defendant that any acts of\n371 wrongdoing *371 have been committed, and they shall not be deemed to create any inference that there is any\nliability therefore. Neither this Final Order of Approval of Settlement, nor the Settlement Agreement, nor any of its\nterms or the negotiations or papers related thereto shall be offered or received in evidence or used for any\npurpose whatsoever, in this or any other matter or proceeding in any court, administrative agency, arbitration, or\nother tribunal, other than as expressly set forth in the Settlement Agreement.\n34. Pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court finds that there is no just reason for\ndelay and therefore directs entry of this Final Order of Approval of Settlement.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

DISTRICfCOURT \nDISTRlCf OF COLUMBIA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThis matter comes before this Court on plaintiffs' second motion for class certification [83], \nwhich was filed on May 5,2003; plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend second amended complaint \nand to file a third amended complaint [72], which was filed on April 17, 2003; plaintiff's motion to \ncompel [87], which was filed on May 20,2003; plaintiff's consent motion to amend second motion \nfor certification ofthe strip search class by adding resumes of Barrett Litt and Paul Estuar[92], which \nwas filed on July 31,2003; defendant's motion for reconsideration [71] of this Court's prior order \n[69] certifying the \"overdetention\" class, which was filed on April 10 ,2003; defendant's motion for \na protective order [75], which was filed on April 22, 2003; and defendant's motion to extend time \n[89], which was filed on May 28,2003. \nUpon consideration of the parties' motions, the opposition and reply briefs filed thereto, and \nthe applicable law in this case, the Court finds that plaintiffs' second motion for class certification \n[83], motion for leave to file third amended complaint [72] and consent motion to amend second \nmotion for certification of the strip search class [92], as well as defendant's motion to extend time \n1 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 2 of 17(cid:10)\n[89] should be GRANTED, and  all other pending motions should be DENIED. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThis action arises under section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871,42 U.S.c. § 1983. \nPlaintiffs are persons who have been, are, or will be strip searched by the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Corrections upon their return from a court appearance which entitled them to release. \nThey seek monetary damages and injunctive relief for defendant's alleged violation of the Fourth \nand Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \nThis Court has already certified a class of overdetained persons and previously denied \nplaintiffs' motion to certify a class of strip-searched persons due to lack of demonstrated numerosity \nof persons who had been both overdetained and strip searched.  According to their third amended \ncomplaint, plaintiffs have dropped the overdetained element from their class and now seek to certify \na class defined as court returns entitled to release who were strip-searched without regard to whether \nthey were also overdetained.  The alleged injury inflicted by defendant against the putative class \nconsists  of subjecting  the  members  to  strip  searches  after the  members  were  returned  to  a \nDepartment of Corrections facility following a judicial determination that there was no longer any \nbasis for the members' detention, apart from processing for release from custody. \nPlaintiffs filed their second motion for class certification on May 5, 2003.  Defendant filed \na memorandum in opposition thereto on May 28, 2003. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS' SECOND MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nIn its prior opinion granting class certification for overdetained persons, this Court delineated \nthe requirements for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 \nF.R.D. 27 (D.D.C., 2003).  Specifically, it noted that \"the party requesting class certification under \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 3 of 17(cid:10)\nRule 23 bears the burden of showing the existence of a class, that all the prerequisites of Rule 23( a) \nare satisfied and the class falls within one of the categories of Rule 23(b).\" Id.  at 30-31 (citations \nomitted). \nFirst, plaintiffmust show the existence ofa class. Bynum. 214 F.R.D. at 31. Second, plaintiff \nmust satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a), which limits the certification of classes to cases in \nwhich \n(I) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are \nquestions oflaw or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses ofthe representative \nparties are typical ofthe claims or defenses ofthe class, and (4) the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \nld.  Third, plaintiff must demonstrate that one of the relevant provisions of Rule 23(b) have been \nsatisfied.  Ie!. \nIn the instant case, plaintiffs contend that the proposed class satisfies subsections (b )(2) and \n(b)(3) of Rule 23.  Rule 23(b)(2) requires a showing that \"the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to  act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\" Id.  Rule \n23(b )(3) requires the Court to find that \"the questions oflaw or fact common to the members ofthe \nclass predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is \nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\" Id. \nThis Court shall consider each requirement in tum. \nA.  Existence of a Class \nAs this Court has previously noted, \"[i]t is axiomatic that for a class action to be certified a \n'class' must exist.\" Bynum. 214 F.R.D. at 31 (citations omitted).  Under this requirement, the class \n3 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 4 of 17(cid:10)\nmust be defined so that it is \"administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular \nindividual is a member.\" Id. (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs' proposed class definition for the strip \nsearch class is as follows: \nEach person who, in the three years preceding the filing of this action, up until the date this \ncase  is  terminated,  has  been,  is  or  will  be:  (i)  in  the  custody  of the  Department of \nCorrections; (ii) taken to court from a Department of Corrections facility;  (iii) ordered \nreleased by the  court or otherwise became  entitled  to  release  by  virtue  of the  court \nappearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was \ndismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, \nwas sentenced to time served, was acquitted orwas otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not \nthe subject of any other pending case or cases which imposed any condition of release other \nthan personal recognizance; (v) was not the subject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was \nreturned to the DC Jailor CTF from court, to be processed out of Department of Corrections \ncustody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing \ncontraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was overdetained. \nPIs'. Second Mot. for Certif. at 15-16.  In short, plaintiffs have defined the class as consisting of \npersons who were strip searched as part of their out-processing from Department of Corrections \ncustody.  As with the overdetention class, this Court is satisfied that \"an individual would be able \nto determine, simply by reading the definition, whether he or she is a member ofthe proposed class.\" \nBynum. 214 F.R.D. at 32. \nB.  Prerequisites of a Class Action under Rule 23(a) \n1.  Impracticability of Joinder \nAs this Court noted in its prior opinion in this case, Rule 23(a)( 1) provides that a class action \nmay be maintained only if \"the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" \nBynum. 214 F.R.D. at 32 (citations omitted).  A court must evaluate the facts of the case to make \ncommon sense assumptions about whether the class as proposed is likely to be large enough to make \njoinder of all parties impracticable.  Id.  This element does not require plaintiffs to provide the exact \n4 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 5 of 17(cid:10)\nnumber of potential class members; rather, they need only provide a reasonable basis for their estimate \nof the putative class size.  Id. \nPlaintiffs rely upon affidavits from 35 individual court returns stating that they were strip \nsearched after they became entitled to release. They also provide affidavits from several persons who \nhave knowledge of the number of court returns on given occasions.  One such affidavit, that of a \nformer employee ofthe District of Columbia Department of Corrections Records Office, estimates \nthat there were approximately 100 court returns per weekday except Friday, which typically had about \n200 court returns.  Of these total numbers of court returns, at least one to five per day had become \nentitled to release by virtue of their appearance, sometimes reaching as many as fifteen on one day. \nAt minimum, these estimates create a class of at least one putative class member per weekday during \nthe three years preceding this action, for a total of approximately 260 per year, or 780 for three years. \nThe more realistic estimate of five per day would bring the putative class to 1,300 per year, or 3,900 \nfor three years. \nDefendant does not dispute that plaintiffs have satisfied the numerosity requirement.  Upon \nconsideration ofplaintifIs' af1idavits, this Court finds it plausible that at least one inmate per day was \na court return entitled to release.  On that basis, plaintiffs have satisfied numerosity, for a minimum \nof 780 putative class members would be impracticable to join individually. \n2.  Commonality \nThe commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) states that there must be \"questions oflaw \nor fact common to the class.\" As acknow ledged in this Court's previous opinion, however, it is not \nnecessary that every issue of law or fact be the same for each class member.  Rather, factual \nvariations among the class members will not defeat the commonality requirement, so long as a single \n5 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 6 of 17(cid:10)\naspect or feature of the claim is common to all proposed class members.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32. \nDefendant claims that plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the commonality requirement because \neach member ofthe putative class will present a claim rooted in the particular circumstances of his \nor her court retum.  Given that a \"single factual  dissimilarity does not suffice to  defeat the \ncommonality requirement,\" this Court is unpersuaded by defendant's argument. Bynum, 214 F .R.D. \nat 33.  Moreover, \"Rule 23 does not require that the representative plaintiff have endured precisely \nthe same injuries that have been sustained by the class members, only that the harm complained of \nbe common to the class, and that the named plaintiff demonstrate a personal interest or threat of \ninjury that is real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"  Id. at 34. \nRegardless of the potential variation of individual circumstances of each inmate's court \nretum, the challenged activity - strip searching - is common to all putative class members.  The \nquestion of whether defendant's policy of strip searching violates the Constitution raises questions \nof law and fact that are common to the class.  When the cause of action arises out of a course of \nconduct that affects a group of persons, one or more elements of the cause of action will be common \nto  the entire group.  Bynum,  214 F.R.D.  at 34 (quoting ALBA  CONTE & HERBERT NEWBERG, \nNEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3.10 (4th ed. 2002».  In this case, as with the overdetention class, \nthe question of causation will be the same for all plaintiffs, because it is the same course of conduct \nthat  allegedly  injured  each  plaintiff.  Therefore,  plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the  commonality \nrequirement of Rule 23(a). \n3.  Typicality \nThe typicality element requires that \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties [be] \ntypical ofthe claims or defenses ofthe class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). As this Court has previously \n6 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 7 of 17(cid:10)\nexplained, the typicality requirement focuses on whether the representatives ofthe class suffered a \nsimilar injury from the same course of conduct as the injury alleged for the entire class. Bynum, 214 \nF.R.D. at 35. Particularly relevant to this case is this Court's prior statement that \"[ a] plaintiff s claim \nis typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to a claim of \nanother class member's where his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.\"  Bynum, 214 \nF.R.D. at 35 (quoting Stewartv. Rubin, 948 F. Supp. 1077, 1088 (D.D.C. 1996), aff'd, 124 F.3d 1309 \n(D.C. CiL 1997)).  Notably, factual variations between the claims of class representatives and the \nclaims of other class members do not negate typicality.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 35. \nPlaintiffs have submitted brief descriptions of the circumstances under which the named \nplaintiffs  were  subjected  to  strip  searches.  Each  was  subjected  to  a strip  search  without  any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion and after he or she had become entitled to release by \nvirtue of a court appearance.  Therefore, all named plaintiffs and putative class members advance the \nsame legal theory based on the same set of facts, namely, that their constitutional rights were violated \nby being subjected to a strip-search after they were entitled to release, and without individualized \nfinding of suspicion.  Defendant does not dispute that plaintiffs have met the typicality requirement. \nThis Court is satisfied that the claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of those of the class as a \nwhole, and that plaintiffs have therefore satisfied the mandate of Rule 23(a)(3). \n4.  Adequacy of Representation \nRule 23 (a)( 4) requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that \"the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  As this Court stated in its \nprevious opinion, adequacy requires that \"( 1) the named representative must not have antagonistic \nor conflicting interests with the unnamed members of the class, and (2) the representative must \n7 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 8 of 17(cid:10)\nappear able to vigorously prosecute the interests ofthe class through qualified counsel.\" Bynum, 214 \nF.R.D. at 35 (citing Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, 117 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C. Cif. 1997) \n(citing Nat 'I Ass 'n  of Regional Medical Programs,  Inc.  v.  Mathews,  551  F.2d 340,  345  (D.C. \nCif.1976)) (internal citation omitted)). \nHere, there is no conf1ict of interest between the named plaintiffs and the proposed class. Two \nof plaintiffs' counsel were found by this Court to be competent to represent the overdetention class; \ntheir qualifications also suffice to meet the adequacy requirement for this class. The other two counsel, \nwhose resumes were submitted by plaintiff in its motion to amend second motion for certification of \nthe strip search class, were admitted pro haec vice after plaintiff filed its first motion for class \ncertification.  Accordingly, their qualifications were not considered in this Court's prior opinion \ncertifying the overdetention class.  One of the pro haec vice attorneys has extensive civil rights \nlitigation experience spanning many years and is currently a principal in a law firm specializing in \ncomplex civil rights litigation.  The other is an associate in the same firm, and while he has more \nrecently graduated from  law school, he has specialized in civil litigation for at least the past nine \nyears, and currently practices in the area of civil rights and public service law litigation. \nThis Court determines that plaintiffs have satisfied the fourth and final prong of Rule 23(a). \nC.  Maintenance of a Class Action under Rule 23(b) \nIn order for the action to be maintained as a class action, once the four requirements of Rule \n23( a) have been met, a court must determine whether one or more ofthe requirements of Rule 23(b) \nhas been satisfied.  Plaintiffs seek certification as a \"hybrid\" Rule 23(b )(2) and (b )(3) class.  This \nCircuit has previously held that such a hybrid class may be certified at the court's discretion, as long \nas the requirements of both provisions are met.  Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d 87, 96 (D.C. Cif. \n8 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 9 of 17(cid:10)\n1997).  This Court will  examine whether plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of either \nsubsection. \n1.  Appropriateness of Equitable Relief \nRule 23(b)(2) provides for class certification where \"the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\"  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b )(2). This Court has previously interpreted this provision as imposing two requirements: \n(1) that defendant's actions or refusal to act are \"generally applicable to the class\" and (2) that \nplaintiffs seek final  injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief on behalf of the class. \nBynum. 214 F.R.D. at 37.  This Court will examine these requirements separately. \nPlaintiffs contend that, because their complaint challenges defendant's blanket policy and \npractice of subjecting all court returns entitled to release by virtue of their court appearances to strip \nsearches, this is a case in which defendant's actions are \"generally applicable to the class.\" As this \nCourt has previously noted, \"it is enough to show that a defendant has acted in a consistent manner \ntoward members of the class so that his actions may be viewed as part of a pattern of activity.\" \nBynum, 214 F.RD. at 37 (citations omitted).  Defendant does not dispute that plaintiff has met this \nrequirement.  This Court is satisfied that defendant's policy and practice of strip searching court \nreturns after they have been ordered released constitutes conduct that is generally applicable to the \nmembers of the class. \nThe remaining requirement of Rule 23(b )(2) is that plaintiffs must be seeking final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief.  Given that plaintiffs' third amended complaint seeks \ndeclaratory and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against defendant, this requirement has \n9 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 10 of 17(cid:10)\nbeen met.  Again, defendant does not dispute that plaintiff has satisfied this requirement. \nAccordingly, since this Court has determined that plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule \n23(b )(2), it will now consider whether they meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). \n2.  Predominance of Common Questions of Law or Fact \nRule 23(b )(3) requires that \"the questions oflaw or fact common to the members ofthe class \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior \nto other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\"  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(b )(3).  This Court has previously held that the requirements of this subsection may be divided \ninto two separate requirements: \"(1) that factual and legal questions common to the class members \npredominate  over any such questions  affecting  only individual  class  members,  and  (2)  that \nmaintaining the action as a class action will be superior to other available methods of adjudication.\" \nBynum. 214 F.R.D. at 39.  The Court will examine these two requirements separately. \nThe first requirement, that common factual and legal issues predominate over any such issues \nthat affect only individual class members, is related to the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a). \nThat is, the issues which this Court has already determined to be common to all members of the class \nmust predominate over any non-common issues.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 39.  Where a case involves \nother factual and legal issues that may have to be tried separately, that does not prevent certifying \nthe class under Rule 23(b)(3).  ld. \nIn this case, the question whether defendant has subjected persons entitled to release to \nsuspicionless strip searches before releasing them is a question of fact that is common to all class \nmembers.  Similarly, whether these searches violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the \nConstitution is a question oflaw that is common to all class members.  Just as in the overdetention \n10 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 11 of 17(cid:10)\nclass in this case, \"resolution of these two questions, which are common to all ofthe class members' \nclaims, would dispose of the issue ofwhether defendant is liable to plaintiffs in this action.\" Bynum, \n214 F.R.D. at 39.  Defendant has provided this Court with no arguments that individualized issues \nof fact or law predominate over the common questions.  This Court is satisfied that plaintiffs have \nshown that factual and legal issues that are common to the class members predominate over any such \nissues that affect only individual class members. \nThe second requirement ofR  ule 23(b )(3) is superiority. Under this requirement, maintaining \nthe present action as a class action must be deemed by the court to be superior to other available \nmethods of adjudication.  A case will often meet this standard when \"common questions of law or \nfact pennit the court to consolidate otherwise identical actions into a single efficient unit.\" Bynum, \n214 F.R.D. at 40 (citations omitted).  As with the overdetained plaintiffs, the individual claims of \nmany of the putative strip search class members are so small that it would not be economically \nefficient for them to maintain individual suits.  In such cases, it has often been held that class \ncertification is appropriate.  Id. \nDefendant argues that plaintiffs have not met the superiority requirement.  The basis of its \nargument appears to be that plaintiffs must show that a trial on the merits of the named plaintiffs' \nclaims prior to certifying a class would be inferior to a class action.  Defendant's argument is \nunpersuasive because it fails to acknowledge that trying plaintiffs' claims individually may lead to \na waste ofj udicial resources if, as plaintiffs suggest, the lack of an organizational plaintiffmay lead \nto a refiling ofthe case with new plaintiffs should the named plaintiffs' claims become moot.  Such \na possibility makes trials of the named plaintiffs' claims inferior to class treatment. \nThis Court has already detennined that the size of the putative class makes joinder of \n11 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 12 of 17(cid:10)\nindividual parties impracticable; it has also determined that the economic stake of each putative \nplaintiff is  too small to  suggest that individual suits would be brought.  These two factors -\nimpracticability of joinder and the unlikelihood of individual suits - and the purpose of judicial \neconomy noted above all point toward the superiority of class treatment for these claims.  Under \nthese circumstances, this Court finds that plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that class \ntreatment is superior. \nDefendant's final  argument against class certification is that the putative class will be \nunmanageable.  Rule 23(b )(3 )(D)  states that \"the difficulties  likely to  be encountered  in the \nmanagement of a class action\" are pertinent to the determination of superiority.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(3)(D).  Specifically, defendant asserts that it will be infeasible to identify putative class \nmembers because the only way to do so will be a manual search through separate lists generated by \nthe Superior Court and Department of Corrections' computer systems. \nPlaintiffs respond, and defendant does not dispute, that their computer expert - the same \nexpert who will be able to generate a list of overdetained class members - will be able to generate \na list of putative strip search class members. Defendant offers no reasonable argument that plaintiffs \nwill be unable to generate a list of putative class members or that doing so will be unmanageable. \nIndeed, the strategy that plaintiffs suggested to identify the overdetention class suggests a \npotential model for this class as well. In the overdetention class, plaintiffs intend to compare records \nof inmates' scheduled release date and actual release date.  Here, plaintiffs could compare court \nappearance dates with release dates to find those plaintiffs who would have been strip searched \nduring out-processing. This Court is satisfied that there are no formidable difficulties that are likely \nto be encountered in the management ofthis action if it is maintained as a class. As this Court found \n12 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 13 of 17(cid:10)\nin its certification of the overdetention class, the present fomm is also appropriate for the strip search \nclass because of the identity of the defendant.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 41. \nThis Court will therefore certify the strip search class as a hybrid (b )(2) / (b )(3) class action, \na  fonn  expressly authorized  by the D. C.  Circuit in Eubanks,  110 F .3d  at 96.  As  with  the \noverdetention class, this Court will certify a (b)(2) class with respect to the plaintiffs' claims for \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, and a (b )(3) class with respect to their claims for monetary \ndamages. All ofthe class members with damages claims against defendant will thus be afforded all \nof the due process protections afforded to members of a (b )(3) class, including notice and opt-out \nrights. The maintenance ofthis action as a hybrid class action will provide ajust and efficient forum \nfor the resolution of all of the claims asserted. \nIII.  DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION \nDefendant requests that this Court vacate its prior order certifying the overdetention class. \nSpecifically, defendant contends that the phrase \"entitled to release\" is inextricably bound up with \nthe merits of plaintiffs' cases and therefore that a class of overdetained persons cannot be properly \ndefined until this Court detennines what period of time constitutes overdetention. Defendant posits \nthat with the class so imprecisely defined, it would be impossible to detennine whether any given \nplaintiff is a member of the class. Consequently, defendant argues, the order should be vacated and \nplaintiffs' motion to certify the overdetention class should be denied.  Defendant envisions that \nplaintiffs' claims of overdetention ought to be considered as individual claims, and a class should \nbe certified only after plaintiffs prevail on the merits and overdetention has been sufficiently defined. \nDefendant makes its motion under Rule 59(e) and under Rule 23. Under either rule, district \ncourts have broad discretion to reconsider or decline to reconsider a class certification order. Cabell \n13 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 14 of 17(cid:10)\nNorton, 226 F. Supp. 2d 175, 177 (D.D.C. 2002). \"The court may invoke its discretion and deny \nV. \nsuch a motion unless it finds an intervening change in controlling law, the availability of new \nevi dence, or the need to correct clear error or manifest inj ustice.\" ld.  Defendant has failed to direct \nthis Court to any relevant changes in the law since March 31,2003, proffered any new evidence, or \nconvinced the Court that reconsideration of its order is necessary to correct a clear error or manifest \ninjustice. \nTo the contrary, this Court finds that its prior holding remains valid: the class definition \ncertified by this Court is sufficiently specific that a putative plaintiff would be able to ascertain \nwhether he or she is a member ofthe class. Additionally, in certifying the class as persons who were \ndetained after midnight on the day that they were entitled to release, this Court has not determined \nthe merits of plaintiffs' claims.  The mere use of terminology such as \"overdetention\" or \"entitled \nto release\" to describe certain circumstances does not rule on whether such overdetention comprises \na  constitutional  tort.  For the  purposes  of defining  the  class,  some  time period comprising \noverdetention must be indicated, but doing so does not infringe upon the factfinder's duty to \ndetermine what time period, if any, is unconstitutional.  The lack of certainty regarding an issue of \nfact or law does not prevent this Court from certifying a class for the purposes of determining that \nvery question. \nAccordingly, defendant's motion will be denied. \nIV.  DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER \nDefendant has requested a protective order against plaintiffs' notice of deposition. Plaintiffs \nhave withdrawn all but one of the contested requests.  The remaining item requests that defendant \nProduce for oral deposition the agent or agents of the District of Columbia most qualified to \n14 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 15 of 17(cid:10)\ntestify on ... [w ]hen, and why, the Department of Corrections began the practice ofretuming \nall inmates transported from the DC Jailor the Central Treatment Facility to the Superior \nCourt for a hearing who become entitled to release by virtue of their court appearances back \nto the DC Jailor other Department of Corrections facility for release. \nPIs.' Notice of Deposition at 3.  Defendant objects to plaintiffs' request on the basis that it \"lacks \nany witness who can respond\" to the request \"because it is the United States Marshal, not the \nDistrict, that instituted the policy in question.\"  Defs. Mot. for Protective Order at 3.  Plaintiffs \ncounter in two parts: first, that defendant retains some control over how the Marshal disposes of \nprisoners; and second, that regardless of defendant's level of control, people employed by defendant \nprobably have some knowledge about why the Marshals changed the policy. PIs' Opp. to Defs. Mot. \nfor Protective Order at 1-2. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26( c) provides that, upon a movant's showing of good cause, \na court \"may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).  Defendant offers \nno good cause why a protective order should be granted. The basis of defendant's opposition is that \nnone of its agents has knowledge of the requested subject matter.  However, as this Court has \npreviously noted, \"overwhelming authority indicates that an alleged lack of knowledge is  an \ninsufficient ground to prohibit the taking of a deposition.\" Kuwait Airways Corp. v. American Sec. \nBank, NA., 1987 WL 11994 at *2 (D.D.C. 1987) (citing cases).  Accordingly, defendant's motion \nfor a protective order will be denied. \nv.  PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE \nPlaintiffs have requested leave to amend their second amended complaint and to file a third \namended complaint in accordance with Federal Rule 15( a).  Defendant objects to plaintiffs' request \n15 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 16 of 17(cid:10)\nfor two reasons. First, defendant assert that plaintiffs are attempting to expand the strip search class \nin order to circumvent this Court's prior finding that plaintiffs had failed to show numerosity. This \npoint is moot because plaintiffs have moved to certify the strip search class on their new definition, \nwhich this Court will grant.  Second, defendant argues that it is pointless to grant plaintiffs' motion \nfor leave to amend while another case, Watkins v. District of Columbia, civil action no. 02-2352 \n(RCL), remains pending.  Thus, defendant argues that plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend should \nbe granted only on condition that plaintiff Watkins dismisses his case. \nFederal Rule 15(a) provides that leave to file amended complaints \"shall be freely given \nwhen justice so requires.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).  This Court fails to see how pending motions in \nanother case have any bearing on plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint.  Defendant \ndirects this Court to no authority for its proposition that leave should be denied unless a plaintiff in \nanother case is willing to dismiss his claim, or that alleged \"pointless less\" provides such basis. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nThis Court has determined that it will be appropriate to certify the present action as a hybrid \nclass action. Plaintiffs have established that the prerequisites for class certification set forth in Rule \n23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have been met.  Plaintiffs have also established that \ndefendant has acted on grounds generally applicable to the class as a whole, making appropriate final \ninj unctive and corresponding declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. The \nclaims ofthe class members for declaratory and injunctive relief will therefore be consolidated for \nmaintenance as a (b )(2) class action. Additionally, the Court finds that questions oflaw and fact that \nare common to the class members predominate over any questions that affect only individual \nmembers, and that a class action will be a superior method for the fair and efficient adjudication of \n16 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 94     Filed 08/11/2003     Page 17 of 17(cid:10)\nthe class members' claims for monetary relief. Therefore, the collective claims ofthe class members \nfor damages will be consolidated for maintenance as a (b)(3) class action. \nAdditionally, this Court finds that defendant's motion for reconsideration of its prior order \nis without merit.  This Court acts well within its discretion in declining to vacate its prior order \ncertifying the overdetention class. \nFinally, this Court finds that defendant's motion for a protective order also lacks merit. \nPlaintiffhas withdrawn all of the contested requests except one. This Court finds that defendant has \nnot shown good cause to grant the protective order with regard to the one remaining request. \nA separate order consistent with the foregoing opinion shall issue this date. \n~(!.~~ \n5'-U-03 \nDate: \noyce C.  amberth \nUnited States District Judge \n17 ",

I.  t::..r. ~ltni I 11l'll<o.Jl I Ui~, ~ \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER  DISTRICT COURT \nThis matter comes before the Court on defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' second \namended complaint [12-1], which was filed on August 23,2002.  Upon consideration of this \nmotion, the opposition thereto, defendants' reply brief, the oral arguments of counsel, and the \napplicable law, the Court finds that defendants' motion should be denied. \nPlaintiffs' second amended complaint alleges that officials ofthe D.C. Jail conduct strip \nsearches upon inmates who return to the jail after receiving release orders.  These searches are \nallegedly perfonned before the inmates are returned to the general prison population to await the \nresults of a search for additional criminal charges against them.  Defendants have moved to \ndismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), on the grounds that these \nallegations fail to state a claim for relief under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \nWhen assessing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs' factual allegations \nmust be presumed to be true and should be liberally construed in their favor.  Phillips v. Bureau \nof Prisons, 591 F.2d 966,968 (D.C. Cir. 1979); Alexander v. FBI, 971 F. Supp. 603, 608 (D.D.C. \n1 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 37     Filed 11/18/2002     Page 2 of 3(cid:10)\n1997).  The complaint should be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt that, under any \nreasonable reading, plaintiffs will be unable to prove any set of facts that would justify relief. \nHaynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1254 (D.C. Cir. 1987). \nThe Supreme Court has set forth the applicable standard for assessing the reasonableness \nof searches performed upon incarcerated persons: \nThe test ofreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a balancing ofthe need for \nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  Courts \nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, \nthe justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).  Applying this test, the Northern District of Illinois \nfound that, in circumstances similar to the instant case, the Fourth Amendment had been \nviolated.  In Gary v. Sheahan, No. 96-C-7294, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378, at *4 (N.D. Ill. \nAug. 19, 1998), the Cook County Department of Corrections strip-searched all female inmates \nwho had received release orders before returning them to jail to await release.  After balancing \nthe jail's need for security against the privacy interests of the inmates, the court held that the \npolicy of strip-searching all female court returns violated the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at *40-41. \nIt decided that the jail should detain inmates who had received release orders in a receiving area \nwhile it determined that there were no outstanding warrants against them.  Id. at *40.  Because \nthere would be no need to return the inmates to the jail during this assessment, there would be no \nneed for any ofthem to be strip-searched unless the discovery of an outstanding warrant required \nher return to the jail popUlation.  Id. \nGiven the holding in Gary, it does not appear to this Court that it will be impossible for \nplaintiffs to establish a set of facts that would mandate relief under the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  Defendants attempt to distinguish Qm on the grounds that plaintiffs do not allege \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 37     Filed 11/18/2002     Page 3 of 3(cid:10)\nthat the D.C. Jail has the ability to detain inmates in a receiving area pending a check for \noutstanding warrants.  But plaintiffs are not required to make such an allegation in their \ncomplaint.  All that is required is for them to have stated a \"short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that [they are] entitled to relief.\"  This they have done.  The strip-search claim \nrepresents a valid claim for relief under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and it would be \ninappropriate for this Court to order dismissal of this claim. \nThe scope of this ruling should not be overstated.  The Court makes no finding today as \nto whether defendants' strip-search policy does or does not violate the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  Instead, the Court has simply determined that it is unable to find as a matter of \nlaw that this part of plaintiffs' complaint should be dismissed at this initial stage of the \nproceedings. \nDefendants have failed to demonstrate that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw on plaintiffs' allegation that their policy of strip-searching inmates violates the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments.  Accordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED that defendants' motion to dismiss [12-1] be, and hereby is, DENIED. \nSO ORDERED. \n~Q.~ \nR'  ce C. Lamberth \nUnited States District Judge \n3 ",

''''-'-'''' \nu.s. l)ISIRICT (',oUfH \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nThis matter comes before the Court on defendant's motion for partial summary judgment \n[41-1], which was filed on December 9,2002, and plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion to deny \ndefendant's motion without prejudice [53-1] or, in the alternative, for an extension of time in \nwhich to complete discovery [53-2], which was filed on January 6,2003.  Upon consideration of \nthe parties' motions, the opposition and reply briefs submitted thereto, and the applicable law in \nthis case, the Court finds that defendant's motion should be denied, and that plaintiffs' motions \nshould be denied as moot. \nIn a memorandum and order issued on November 18, 2002, the Court denied defendant's \nmotion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims relating to strip searches allegedly conducted by defendant. \nThe Court explained that the applicable legal standard governing plaintiffs' claims was the test \nset out by the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979): \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a balancing ofthe need for \nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  Courts \nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, \n1 \nc:  \\ \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 70     Filed 03/31/2003     Page 2 of 3(cid:10)\nthe justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nOn the basis of the allegations set forth in plaintiffs' second amended complaint relating to strip \nsearches purportedly conducted by defendant, the Court concluded that it would not be \nimpossible for plaintiffs to establish a set of facts that would mandate relief under the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments.  Put another way, the Court concluded that it might be possible for \nplaintiffs to demonstrate that the searches conducted were \"unreasonable\" under the Fourth \nAmendment.  As evidence for its conclusion, the Court pointed to a recent case from the \nNorthern District of Illinois, in which the court concluded that a county corrections department \nviolated the Fourth Amendment when it strip-searched all female inmates who had received \nrelease orders before returning them to jail to await release. \nDefendant's present motion states that it is entitled to partial summary judgment because \nof a myriad of factual differences between the present case and the Illinois case cited by the \nCourt, Gary v. Sheahan, No. 96-C-2794, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 19, 1998). \nBut the Court's prior opinion neither stated that it considered Gary to constitute controlling \nauthority nor indicated that its denial of defendant's motion to dismiss was founded solely upon \nthe factual similarities between Gary and the present case.  Instead, the Court merely pointed to \nGary as one factor supporting its inability to conclude, at the dismissal stage of the proceedings, \nthat the plaintiffs' strip search claims should be dismissed as a matter of law.  Therefore, simply \nbecause the facts of the present case might differ from the underlying facts in Gary does not \nmean that it will be impossible for plaintiffs to show that the strip searches were unreasonable, \nand that defendant is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these claims. \nThe D.C. Circuit has stated that \"decision by summary judgment is disfavored when \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 70     Filed 03/31/2003     Page 3 of 3(cid:10)\nadditional development of facts might illuminate the issues oflaw requiring decision.\"  Nixon v. \nFreeman, 670 F.2d 346, 262 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  The Court concludes that it would be premature to \nconsider a motion for summary judgment when the discovery process, which has apparently not \neven commenced, might yield additional facts that would guide the Court's decision as to the \nmerits of plaintiffs' strip search claims.  Once discovery has ended, the parties may elect to \nsubmit summary judgment motions, at their discretion. \nOne last point deserves mention.  In defendant's brief in opposition to plaintiffs' Rule \n56(f) motion, defendant represented that the parties were involved in an ongoing disagreement \nabout discovery scheduling issues.  If that disagreement has not been resolved, the parties may \nfile a motion requesting an order from the Court to set a discovery schedule in this case. \nThe Court has determined that any motion for summary judgment in this case will be \npremature until the close of the discovery process.  Accordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED that defendant's motion for partial summary judgment [41-1] be, and hereby \nis, DENIED.  It is further \nORDERED that plaintiffs' Rule 56(f) motion to deny defendant's motion for partial \nsummary judgment without prejudice [53-1] be, and hereby is, DENIED as moot.  It is further \nORDERED that plaintiffs' motion, in the alternative, for an extension of time in which to \ncomplete discovery [53-2] be, and hereby is, DENIED as moot. \nSO ORDERED. \n~c.~ \nDate: \nR  ce C.

Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and injunctive relief for \ndefendant’s alleged violations of the fourth, fifth and eight amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. The plaintiffs are prisoners of the D.C. Department of Corrections \nalleging that the District of Columbia (hereafter also “District” or “D.C.”) has a \npattern, practice and policy of subjecting inmates to over-detention and subjecting \nin-custody defendants ordered released at their court appearances to strip searches \nupon their return to the D.C. Jail for processing of records and property before \nrelease. The named plaintiffs are Marcus Bynum, Kim Nabinette, Leroy S. \nThomas, Dianne Johnson, Gloria Scarborough, and Julian Ford. \nThe Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:  \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 2 of 23(cid:10)\n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District of \nColumbia Department of Corrections facility beginning in the three years \npreceding the filing of this action on or about May 16, 2002 up to and until August \n31, 2005; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future will not be released by \nmidnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be released by court order \nor the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired.  \nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above \nexcept that it ends on August 31, 2005. \nThe Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:  \nEach person who, beginning in the three years, preceding the filing of this action, \nup until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or will be (i) in the custody of \nthe Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to Court from a Department of \nCorrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled \nto release by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had \nbeen held was no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered \nreleased on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time \nserved, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was returned to the \nDC Jail or CTF from court, to be processed out of Department of Corrections \ncustody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search \nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable or probable cause that he was \n  2\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 3 of 23(cid:10)\nconcealing contraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he \nwas over-detained.  \nThe Strip Search Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except \nthat it ends on August 31, 2005. \n  In the interest of avoiding expense, delay and inconvenience of further \nlitigation of issues raised in this action, in the absence of any admission of liability \nby defendant, and in reliance upon the representations contained herein, and in \nconsideration of the mutual promises, covenants and obligations in this Agreement, \nand for good and valuable consideration, plaintiffs and defendant, through their \nundersigned counsel, agree and stipulate as follows:  \nI.

The parties agree \nthat the monetary relief shall compensate for all alleged violations of \nrights and all claims and any other incidents of incarceration by the \nplaintiff class members that were or could have been brought in this \ncivil action under any theory of liability for any claims related to \nallegedly unlawful over-detentions and strip searches, except as to \nmonetary damages for those class members who choose to opt out. \n  6\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 7 of 23(cid:10)\n3.  This Settlement Agreement comprises the full and exclusive \nagreement of the parties with respect to the matters discussed herein. \nThis agreement incorporates and supersedes any other agreements. \nNo representations or inducements to compromise this action have \nbeen made, other than those recited in this Agreement. \nII.  Class-wide Prospective Relief \nA.  Strip Search Class \n1.  The plaintiffs’ claims for prospective relief regarding the strip \nsearch class will be resolved by the D.C. Department of \nCorrections’ plan to divert inmates ordered released or otherwise \nentitled to release from the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia to a secure location outside of the open population of the \nD.C. Jail or another location where they will not be subject to a \nstrip search, absent individualized suspicion, while the record \nreview for detainers and warrants and property retrieval are \nconducted prior to release. This process shall be implemented on \nor before August 31, 2005. The Monetary Relief Strip Search Class \nwill extend through that date. \n2.  The parties will defer the initiation of class notice until after \nAugust 31, 2005. \n  7\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 8 of 23(cid:10)\n3.  If the District has not accomplished the change in the strip search \nprocedure by August 31, 2005, then any persons strip searched \nafter that time will have a new claim for that subsequent search, \nwhich is not covered by this settlement.  \n4.  In addition, in the scenario set forth in paragraph 3 immediately \nabove, the Strip Search Injunctive Relief Class and class counsel \nwill be free at that point to pursue additional litigation in this case \nto enjoin the District’s continuing Strip Search policy, and the \nDistrict will be free to oppose it. Any fees awarded to the class as \nprevailing parties for such litigation shall be separate from the \nClass Fund Attorney’s Fees. \n5.  The parties note that the court has previously entered orders \ncertifying both an Over-detention and Strip Search class; that no \nmaterial modifications have been made to that definition; that the \ncourt has made the findings necessary to support the certification \nand no further findings are necessary in this regard; and that the \nClass Counsel listed above were appointed at that time as counsel \nfor the class. \n  8\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 9 of 23(cid:10)\n \n B.  Successors  \nThe terms of the Agreement shall each be binding on the \nPlaintiffs and the District of Columbia, and their successors and \nassigns, subject to the modification clause set forth in Section \nC, below. \nC.   Modification as a Result of Changes in Applicable Law  \nThe parties recognize that, following execution of this \nAgreement, there may be changes in controlling law that \nwarrant modification. The Settlement Agreement shall be \nsubject to modification by the Court upon the application of \neither party based on changes in applicable state or federal law \nafter August 31, 2005, as it relates to injunctive relief. No \nmodification shall apply as it relates to monetary relief.  \nIII.  Class-wide Monetary Relief  \nA.  Monetary Payments  \n1.  Within 45 days of the Final District Court approval of this \nsettlement, the District will pay the sum of $12 million (“the \nSettlement Funds”), less the costs advanced by the District for \npreparation and publication of the Class Notice and related \n  9\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 10 of 23(cid:10)\nadministrative expenses, which amount shall be deemed to be \nin exchange for a full and final release of all claims to be \ncontained in the Final Order of Approval of Settlement. The \npayment will be such that the funds will be deposited and \ncleared through the appropriate accounts within that 45-day \nperiod. How the funds will be used and allocated is addressed \nin ¶¶ III (A)(3-6) below. \n2.   If no appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States has been filed, then the settlement \nfunds will be paid on the timetable set forth in the preceding \nparagraph. If an appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States has been filed, then \nthe District shall distribute the Settlement Funds in \naccordance with the provisions of ¶¶ III (A)(3-6) below within \n30 days of the date that all appellate avenues of review have \nbeen exhausted, including Supreme Court review, if the \nsettlement is ultimately approved. If the result of the appeal or \nSupreme Court review is that the settlement is not ultimately \napproved, then the case shall revert to active litigation, and the \nDistrict shall have no responsibility to pay any Settlement \n  10\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 11 of 23(cid:10)\nFunds not previously paid for the costs of class notice and \nrelated administrative expenses.  \n3.  The parties agree that $3 million of the $12 million payment \nreferenced above will revert to the D.C. Department of \nCorrections to be spent on programs and services which relate \nto the subject of this complaint (hereafter “reversion fund”). \nThese funds may be spent on new staff, services, construction, \ntechnology, equipment, programs or other activities otherwise \nnecessary to improve or assist in processing inmates for \nrelease of inmates and to reduce incidents of over-detention \nand the need to strip search, without individualized suspicion, \ninmates who meet the definition of the strip search class. It is \nunderstood that the reversion fund exists to fund the \ninjunctive relief changes necessary to eliminate the over-\ndetentions and strips searches that are the subject of this \nlawsuit and will be for new programs or activities not \npreviously budgeted (and specifically not as a part of the \ngeneral budget). The mediators in the case will work with the \nparties to identify specifically how and when the reversionary \namount will be spent. If, by August 31, 2005, the parties have \n  11\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 12 of 23(cid:10)\nbeen unable to agree specifically how all of these funds will \nbe spent, either side may submit its proposals to the Court, \nwhich will then decide how to spend any amount not \notherwise agreed to based on the criteria set forth above. This \ndecision will be binding and may not be appealed by either \nside. \n4.  The parties agree that the injunctive relief objective of this \nagreement is the elimination of over-detentions and court \nrelease strip searches. To that end, the District will, for a \nperiod of two years, provide to Class Counsel annually a \nreport on whether 1) it has strip searched any court returns \nentitled to release absent individualized reasonable suspicion \nto do so, and whether 2) it has released any detainees or \ninmates more than 24 hours after the time they become \nentitled to release, and the reasons therefore. \n5  The parties agree that the settlement amount shall include all \nattorneys’ fees and costs. Plaintiffs intend to submit a petition \nfor attorneys’ fees and costs to the Court for the sum of $4 \nmillion dollars. Defendant takes no position regarding the \nPlaintiffs’ petition for attorneys’ fees and costs. If the Court \n  12\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 13 of 23(cid:10)\nawards less than $4 million for the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees \ncosts, the remainder of the $4 million shall revert to the \nDistrict of Columbia on programs and services that relate to \nthe subject of this complaint, and shall be subject to the same \nterms as are set forth in ¶ III(A)(3) above. \n6.  The parties agree that $5 million dollars of the settlement \namount shall be used for the compensation of the plaintiffs \nand for the administration and distribution of the monetary \ncompensation fund, including the claims verification \nprocedure. The plaintiffs will develop a plan of distribution to \naddress all of the plaintiffs’ claims and that plan shall be \nsubmitted to the Court for approval. The claims procedure \nshall include a verification process to ensure that claimants \nare members of one or both classes, and the length of the \nclaimants’ over-detention. The Claims Administrator and \nClass Counsel will distribute this money according to the \nterms of the Final Order of Approval of Settlement. Plaintiffs \nshall use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the \nsettlement amount will occur in such a way so that no residual \namount (of the $5 million compensation fund) will remain \n  13\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 14 of 23(cid:10)\nfollowing final distribution. However, if some residual \nhappens to remain after reasonable efforts to distribute funds \nto class members who have filed claims have been exhausted, \nthe residual amount will revert to the reversion fund defined \nin ¶ III(A)(3) above.  \nIV. Procedures for Approval of the Final Settlement Agreement \nA.  Application for Preliminary Approval  \nThe parties will apply for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement \nAgreement by June 16, 2005. At that time, the proposed Order of \nFinal Approval of Settlement will be presented to the court. A hearing \nwill be held within 30 days thereafter, at which time the court will \nmake a preliminary determination that the settlement appears fair, \nadequate and just; determine whether it will approve the class notice; \nand set a date for the Fairness Hearing and any other dates that need to \nbe determined.  \nB.  Notice to Potential Claimants  \n1.  Application for Preliminary District Court approval shall occur as \nsoon as is practicable. However, since the definition of the \nMonetary Relief classes (both Over-detention and Strip Search) \nextends through August 31, 2005, notice will be sent as soon as \n  14\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 15 of 23(cid:10)\npracticable after that date. At that time, a copy of the Notice (set \nforth in Exhibit C) and the Claim Form (set forth in Exhibit D) \nshall be distributed to every person identified as a class member.  \n2.  Plaintiffs will distribute the Notice and Claim Form by first class \nmail to the last known address of each class member. \n3.  The District will pay to the Class Administrator the costs of \npreparing and publishing the Class Notice and other expenses \nrelated to the publication and distribution of notice to the class. \nThe Class Administrator shall provide an estimate of the costs of \nnotice no later than July 20, 2005, and the necessary funds shall be \npaid to the Class Administrator no later than August 8, 2005, and \nsupplemented in the event the Class Administrator provides a \nsupplemental estimate. Any such payments shall be credited \nagainst the $12 Million Class Settlement. However, if for any \nreason this settlement is not ultimately approved, the District shall \nhave no claim against Plaintiffs, the Class or Class Counsel for \nreimbursement of the costs of notice and related costs for which it \nadvanced funds, except to be credited in any subsequent settlement \nof this case.  \n  15\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 16 of 23(cid:10)\n4.  A modified and shortened form of the Class Notice shall be \npublished by plaintiffs at least in the following newspapers: \nWashington Post, Washington Times and the City Paper, as well as \nsuch regional newspapers as plaintiffs shall determine, in \nconsultation with the Class Administrator, are reasonably \nnecessary to provide notice to the class, not to exceed three \nregional newspapers, unless plaintiffs obtain consent from \ndefendants, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or approval \nfrom the court. The notice shall be published twice a week for two \nweeks, in the section of the newspaper ordinarily devoted to local \nnews. Publication shall occur on at least one Sunday for each \nnewspaper with a Sunday edition. \n5.  Defendant shall post the Notice on each Unit of the D.C. Jail and \nthe Correctional Treatment Facility, along with extra copies of the \nClaim Form. The Notice shall remain posted until the period for \nclass members to return the Claim Form has expired.  \n  C.  Deadline for Submitting Claim Forms and to Opt Out  \n1.  The Class Notice shall advise Class Members that they must file a \nclaim form or opt out by a date certain, or they will nonetheless be \nbound by the settlement, which date will be at least 60 days from \n  16\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 17 of 23(cid:10)\nthe time the initial notices are sent out.  Any class member wishing \nto pursue a claim must file a Claim Form by that date in order to \nparticipate in the Class Distribution. Claim forms must be \npostmarked or received in hand by that date. Any class member \nwishing to opt out of this Settlement Agreement must similarly \nhave either sent a an opt out letter postmarked, or delivered by \nhand, by that date.  \n  D.  Submission of Materials Preliminary to the Fairness Hearing. \nWithin at least 15 days before the Fairness Hearing, Plaintiffs will file \na report with the Court on the number of claims received and the \nnumber of class members who have elected to opt out of the \nSettlement Agreement.  \nE.  Objections  \nAny person who wishes to object to the terms of this Settlement \nAgreement will be required, not less than 30 days prior to the Fairness \nHearing, to submit a written statement to the Court, with copies to \ncounsel for the parties, setting forth his or her objections. The \nstatement shall contain the individual’s name, address and telephone \nnumber, along with a statement of his or her objection(s) to the \nSettlement Agreement and the reason(s) for the objection(s). The \n  17\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 18 of 23(cid:10)\nparties shall file a response to any such objections at least 15 days \nprior to the Fairness Hearing. \nF.  Severability  \nThe parties do not intend this Agreement to be severable; if it is not \napproved in its entirety, either side may withdraw from it within 10 \ndays of the court’s determination that it will not accept the settlement \nagreement as is and the court’s indication of the specific modifications \nto it, in which case this agreement will be null and void.  \n V. Administrative Issues \n1.  Plaintiffs, acting through Class Counsel and the Class \nAdministrator, shall have sole responsibility for determining the \nclass distribution formula, the weight to be given to various \nfactors, and the proportionate distribution between Over-detention \nand Strip Search Class members, for distribution of the monetary \nportion of the settlement going to class members, subject to \nultimate approval approved by the Court. The Defendant shall take \nno position on these issues. \n2.  The Distribution system that Plaintiffs will propose to the court \nwill be a point system that will rely solely on on the information \nobtained from the Defendant’s (including Superior Court) records, \n  18\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 19 of 23(cid:10)\nas supplemented by CSOSA records, with the exception of the \nNamed Plaintiffs. \n3.  No later than July 30, 2005, the District of Columbia shall make \navailable, to the extent that such information has not already been \nprovided, the name, address, social security number, date of birth \nand driver's license information of class members, to the extent it \nexists and is reasonably available from its records, to Class \nCounsel, to be forwarded to the Class Administrator in \ncomputerized form (to the extent it exists in computerized form), \nto facilitate locating class members. Such information shall be \nconfidential, and may not be disclosed to anyone except counsel of \nrecord, the Class Administrator, and such representatives of the \nDistrict of Columbia and, to the extent provided by court orders \nand agreement of counsel, counsel of record in Watson v. District \nof Columbia, Case No. 02-980 (GK-JMF). This information shall \ncover the class period until June 30, 2005. The period July 1 to \nAugust 31, 2005, shall be provided in a supplemental submission \nby no later than September 10, 2005. \n4.  Defendant shall make available to plaintiffs’ counsel from the \nJACCS and CIS computer databases, and other databases, and \n  19\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 20 of 23(cid:10)\npaper records, information reasonably necessary for administration \nand verification of claims, to the extent necessary and reasonably \naccessible. \n5.  The Defendant undertakes to use reasonable efforts to assist \nPlaintiffs in obtaining from Court Services and Offender \nSupervision Agency (“CSOSA”) prior to the deadline for sending \nnotice, upon a written request from Class Counsel the most recent \naddress, social security number, date of birth and driver's license \ninformation, to the extent reasonably available, in computerized \nform, of the Class Members, so that the data can be provided to the \nClass Administrator. \n6.  Plaintiffs will use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the \nsettlement amount will occur in such a way as to insure that no \nresidual amount of money will remain following final distribution. \nThis will likely include a second round of distribution to class \nmembers who have filed claims for amounts allocated to class \nmembers who do file claims but then become unavailable. If some \nresidual happens to remain after all reasonable efforts to distribute \nfunds to class members who have filed claims have been \n  20\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00956-RCL     Document 122-2     Filed 06/16/2005     Page 21 of 23(cid:10)\nexhausted, stemming from the accrual of interest, for example, this \nwill revert to the reversion fund defined in ¶ III(A)(3) above. \n7.  The reversion of any portion of the class fund to the District of \nColumbia does not affect the amount of the class fund for purposes \nof determining the percentage of attorney’s fees to be paid class \ncounsel (see Definition of Class Fund Attorney’s Fees, above) or \nthe timing of that payment. \nVI. Non-admission \nThe plaintiffs allege in their Amended Complaint that the Department has \nengaged in a pattern and practice of over-detention and unlawful strip \nsearching. Defendant denies those allegations. Entry of the Agreement \ndoes not operate as an admission of liability by the D.C. Department of \nCorrections or the District of Columbia of Plaintiffs’ allegations. \nVII. Amendments \nWith the consent of the parties, additional provisions may be added to \nthis Settlement Agreement if needed to assure appropriate \nimplementation and court approval.  \nSigned and Agreed to by:  \n \n   \n   \nDATED: ____________________  ________________________ \nRICHARD S.

The notice given to the class is hereby determined to be fully in compliance with requirements of Rule 23 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and due process and is found to be the best notice practicable under the\ncircumstances and to constitute due and sufficient notice to all parties entitled thereto.\n5. Due and adequate notice of the proceedings having been given to the Class and a full opportunity having been\noffered to the Class to participate in the hearing, it is hereby determined that all Class Members, except those\nwho have opted out of the settlement (who are listed in Exhibit 1 to this Order) are bound by this Final Order of\nApproval of Settlement.

There were a combined total of two objections to the settlement and/or the Motion for an award of attorneys'\nfees filed. Mr. Gregory Bess, through counsel, challenged the accuracy of the data on his claim form regarding\nthe number of over-detention days he was entitled to. Mr. Bess through counsel and Class Counsel filed a notice\nwithdrawing his objection before the Final Fairness Hearing and his counsel appeared at the Final Fairness\nHearing and confirmed that Mr. Bess was withdrawing his objection because the error on his claim form had been\ncorrected by Class Counsel. Mr. Richard Jones, acting pro se, filed an objection to the effect that the District\nshould not receive money for programs from the settlement, that the attorneys should not receive 1/3 from the\nsettlement, and that the distribution formula was faulty or that class members should be receiving more money\n\nthan proposed under the settlement. At the hearing, Mr. Jones stated to the Court that after reviewing Class\nCounsel's written responses to his objections, and after discussing his objections with Class Counsel, he wanted\nto withdraw his objection to the reversion because he realized that it was being used to fund the injunctive relief\ncomponent of the settlement, and to withdraw his objection to the attorneys' fees request because he thought it\nwas fair in light of Class Counsel's efforts. Mr. Jones did maintain his objection to the amount of the settlement to\nbe distributed to plaintiffs, and to the fact that class members would not know the exact size of the award until\nafter all claims had been processed. The Court concludes that the proposed method of allocating a sum certain\nfor distribution to all class members who filed valid and timely claims (as allowed by this Order) is fair, especially\nsince this is the only method for the District to be certain about its liability under the settlement. Several persons\nsent letters to Class Counsel or to the Class Administrator challenging the accuracy of the data in their claim\nforms, claiming membership in the class, or complaining about aspects of the settlement generally. None of these\nletters complied with the procedure for making objections to the Bynum Settlement Agreement provided in 15 of\nthe Class Notice. Letters to Class Counsel or to the Class Administrator by persons challenging the accuracy of\nthe data in their claim forms, or claiming membership in the class, will be examined according to the verification\nprocedure set out below in this Order. Letters complaining about aspects of the settlement generally that did not\n77 comply with the procedure for making objections *77 to the Bynum Settlement Agreement provided in ¶ 15 of the\nClass Notice will not be treated as objections. None of the letters complaining about aspects of the settlement\ngenerally raised issues that the Court has not already addressed in overruling Mr. Jones' objections.\na. The Court concludes that Class Counsel negotiated a very favorable fund for distribution to\nclass members. The low number of opt outs and objectors (or purported objectors) supports the\nconclusion that the terms of the settlement were viewed favorably by the overwhelming majority of\nclass members. For example, in Neal v. Director of the Department of Corrections, this Court\napproved a class action settlement where four of the eight named plaintiffs objected and 60\npeople filed comments or objections and the class was ultimately held to comprise about 125\nmembers. Memorandum Opinion, Neal v. Director, Department of Corrections, 93-cv-02420 (RCL)\nJune 28, 1999, pages 14, 22, and 27. See also, e.g., Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115,\n118-119 (3d Cir.1990) (\"only\" 29 objections in 281 member class \"strongly favors settlement\"); In\nre Prudential Ins. Co. of America Sales Practices Litigation, 148 F.3d 283, 318 (3d Cir.1998)\n(affirming conclusion that class reaction was favorable where 19,000 policyholders out of 8 million\nopted out and 300 objected).\nSettlement Agreement approved because fair, adequate, and reasonable\n7. The settlement of this Lawsuit was not the product of collusion between Plaintiffs and Defendant or their\nrespective counsel, but rather was the result of bona fide and arm's-length negotiation conducted in good faith by\nthe Parties and their counsel through the United States District Court Mediation Program administered by the\nOffice of the Circuit Executive for the United States Courts for the District of Columbia Circuit, pursuant to LCvR\n84. The Settlement Agreement and the settlement set forth therein are hereby approved and found to be fair,\nadequate, reasonable, in the best interest of the Class as a whole, and in satisfaction of Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure and due process requirements.\nClass certified under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3)\n8. The Court has previously certified both an Over-detention Class and a Strip Search Class under both\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3). This is a hybrid class action, certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) with regard to\nseeking injunctive relief on over-detentions, and strip searches of inmates under the definition of the strip search\nclass set forth herein. Therefore, regarding prospective relief, no member of the class may opt-out. With regards\nto monetary relief, the class is certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) and class members have a right to opt out of\nthe monetary relief stage.\n9. The Over-Detention Injunctive Relief Class is defined as:\n(a) Each person who has been, is or will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of\nCorrections facility beginning in the three years preceding the filing of this action on or about May\n16, 2002 up to and until the date this case is terminated; and (b) who was not released, or, in the\n\nfuture will not be released by midnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be released\n78 by court order or the date on which *78 the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired.\nThe Over-Detention Monetary Relief Class is defined the same as above except that it ends on August 31, 2005.\nClass-wide Prospective Relief\n11. The plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief regarding the Over-detention and the strip search classes have\nbeen resolved by the cessation of the practices of Over-detentions and strip-searching court returns entitled to\nrelease. No court order is entered under the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties on these\nissues. The parties agree that the injunctive relief objective of this agreement is the elimination of over-detentions\nand court release strip searches. To that end, the District will, for a period of two years, provide to Class Counsel\nannually a report on whether 1) it has strip searched any court returns entitled to release absent individualized\nreasonable suspicion to do so, and whether 2) it has released any detainees or inmates more than 24 hours after\nthe time they become entitled to release, and the reasons therefore. In addition, under the terms of this\nsettlement elaborated further on in this Order, the District must invest substantial funds in new renovations that\nwill substantially contribute to processing of inmates in the jail.\nClass Counsel\n12. The Court reaffirms the appointment of William Claiborne, Lynn Cunningham and Barrett S. Litt as Class\nCounsel, and, based upon the work that has occurred between the Preliminary Approval Order and the present,\nreaffirms the findings it made at the time of the Preliminary Approval Order confirming or appointing them.\nPursuant to F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(g)(1)(i), the Court considered the following points in appointing class counsel: (1)\nthe work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action, (2) counsel's experience in\nhandling class actions, and other complex litigation, of the type asserted in the action, based in part on affidavits\nsubmitted by counsel in support of their motions to certify, (3) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law, (4) the\nresources counsel committed to representing the class; as well as other matters pertinent to counsel's ability to\nfairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. The Court finds that Plaintiffs' counsel have done\nextensive research in this case, including taking numerous depositions and affidavits and interviewing numerous\npersons who have knowledge of the case, and thoroughly analyzing the computer records of the District of\nColumbia. Plaintiffs' counsel are competent to represent the members of the class.\nPayment by the District of Columbia\n13. As set forth in more detail in the Settlement Agreement, the District of Columbia agreed to pay a total of\nTwelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000) in settlement of this Lawsuit.\n14. Within 45 days of this Order, or within such other time frame as the parties through their counsel may\nmutually agree upon, but only after the time for all appeals and petition for writ of certiorari filed with the U.S.\nSupreme Court challenging the Court approval of the settlement has lapsed, the District will pay the sum of $12\nmillion (\"the Settlement Funds\"), less the costs advanced by the District for preparation and publication of the\nClass Notice and related administrative expenses, which amount shall be deemed to be in exchange for a full\nand final release of all claims to be contained in the Final Order of Approval of Settlement. $9 Million of that\n79 payment (less monies already paid to Rosenthal) will be deposited *79 and cleared within that 45-day period into\na client-trust account that will be designated by Class Counsel in an e-mail to defense counsel at least 20 days\nbefore the money is due. $3 Million of that payment will be deposited and cleared within that 45-day period into a\nspecial District account, from which the payments designated in ¶ 32 will be made. How the funds will be used\nand allocated is addressed in detail below and in the Settlement Agreement.\n15. If no appeal or petition for U.S. Supreme Court review has been filed, then the settlement funds will be paid\non the timetable set forth in the preceding paragraph. If an appeal or petition for writ of certiorari has been filed,\nthen the District shall distribute the Settlement Funds in accordance with the provisions below within 30 days of\nthe date that all appellate avenues of review (including Supreme Court review) have been exhausted if the\nsettlement is ultimately approved. If the result of the appeal or Supreme Court review is that the settlement is not\n\nultimately approved, then the case shall revert to active litigation, and the District shall have no responsibility to\npay any Settlement Funds not previously paid for the costs of class notice and related administrative expenses.\n16. The parties agreed that $3 million of the $12 million payment referenced above will revert to the D.C.\nDepartment of Corrections to be spent on programs and services which relate to the subject of this complaint\n(hereafter \"reversion fund\"). The standards and allocations for the reversion fund are addressed further in ¶ 32, \ninfra.\n17. The parties agreed that $5 million dollars of the settlement amount would be used for the compensation of the\nplaintiffs and for the administration and distribution of the monetary compensation fund, including the claims\nverification procedure. The cost of class notice and administration, any costs awarded, and the Named Plaintiffs'\nDistribution, all addressed elsewhere in this Order, will be paid from this fund, which the District of Columbia shall\npay to the Class Administrator, less costs it has already advanced, within the time frame set forth above. The\nremainder, after payment of the costs awarded, class notice and class administration from the fund, will be\ndistributed to the Class Members who filed claim forms according to the following formula:\na. Over-detentions will receive one point per day for the first two days of over-detention and one\npoint for each additional two days or partial days of over-detention. The maximum number of\npoints to be awarded for an over-detention is 180. Determination of days of over-detention is\nbased solely on the Defendant's records as interpreted by Plaintiffs' experts and the Class\nAdministrator (including, for those who filed claims disputing the information contained in their\nclaim forms or claiming that they were improperly excluded from the class, as adjusted based on\njackets, i.e., Department of Corrections hard copy paper records, for those whose jackets are\navailable for examination).\nb. Strip searches will be valued based on the following formula, which will be determined solely on\nthe basis of the Defendant's records as interpreted by Plaintiffs' experts and the Class\nAdministrator:\ni. Anyone who went to trial and was acquitted: 30 points.\nii. First Offenders not charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 25 points\n80 *80 iii. Repeat offenders not charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 15\npoints.\niv. First Offenders charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 10 points.\nv. Repeat offenders charged with offenses involving drugs, prostitution or violence: 5 points.\nvi. Women in categories i-ii above will receive an additional 20 points. Women in categories iii-iv\nwill receive an additional 10 points.\nc. Despite the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the following parameters will modify the\npoint systems set forth above:\ni. no person who files and qualifies for a claim will be paid less than $50, and the final distribution\nformula will be adjusted accordingly;\nii. no Over-detention claimant will receive more than 180 Over-detention points regardless of the\nnumber of points they would receive under the point system set forth above;\niii. no strip search claimant will receive any additional strip search points after the first three strip\nsearches reflected in the records for the class period; and\niv. if a strip search claimant has more than one strip search reflected in the records for the class\nperiod, the strip search points for that individual will be calculated on the assumption that all strip\nsearches for that individual are repeat offender incidents, including the first strip search reflected\nin the records.\n\nd. As with over-detention points, the hard copy records of individuals' information (where\nreasonably available as described below) regarding strip searches covered by this Settlement will\nbe accessed and reviewed where the individual has in writing to Class Counsel or to the Class\nAdministrator either disputed the accuracy of information provided on his claim form or has\nclaimed that he was wrongfully excluded from the class.\ne. The District of Columbia shall make all reasonable efforts to locate and provide copies of the\nhard copy records of the individuals for whom such records are called under the provisions of this\nparagraph and its subparts. If, after such reasonable efforts, the District is unable to locate such\nrecords, the District shall communicate that fact in writing to the Class Administrator, in which case\nthe computer records shall control.\n18. Plaintiffs shall use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the settlement amount will occur in such a\nway so that no residual amount of the $5 million compensation fund will remain following final distribution. Thus,\nto the extent that checks are written to class claimants and not cashed within six months of mailing, the amount\nremaining will be mailed in a second round of distribution to those class members who did both file claims and\ncash the checks sent to them. The second round distribution shall be based on each such claimant's pro rata\nshare of the fund remaining, utilizing the same distribution formula as was used in the first round. Thereafter, if\nsome residual still remains, that residual amount will revert to the reversion fund discussed above.\nNamed Plaintiffs' Distribution\n19. The Court approves the Named Plaintiffs Distribution in the amount of $200,000 (exclusive of fees and costs).\nThe Named Plaintiffs are listed in the first paragraph of the Bynum Settlement Agreement, which was attached as\n81 an attachment *81 to the Preliminary Approval Order entered by the Court. The Court concludes that this award is\njustified because the Named Plaintiffs made contributions to the class as a whole, justifying awards to them\nhigher than those to the general class. In addition, the Named Plaintiffs' individualized damages claims, including\nspecial damages, are a factor in the determination of the sum they receive. Such determinations cannot\nreasonably be made for class members in general without unduly consuming funds for administrative costs that\nwill otherwise be available for distribution to Class members. Any fees due Class Counsel for their representation\nof the Named Plaintiffs are encompassed within the Class Fund Attorney's Fees referenced herein. The Class\nAdministrator shall pay each Named Plaintiff the amount designated by Class Counsel.\nClass Fund Attorneys' Fees\n20. The parties agreed that the settlement amount shall include all attorneys' fees and costs, and that the\nPlaintiffs could seek up to 1/3 of the Settlement Funds of $12,000,000 as attorney's fees (exclusive of costs). The\nCourt awards Class Counsel 1/3 (33.3 %) of the $12,000,000 Settlement Funds as Class Fund Attorneys' Fees,\nto be allocated among the lawyers who worked on the case, by agreement between Class Counsel, as well as\ncosts, disbursements, and expenses, with pro rated interest from the date of the deposit of the Settlement Funds\nearned by the Class Fund. Class Fund Attorneys' Fees do not include the costs of pursuing the lawsuit to\nresolution, the costs after settlement, and the payment of the costs of Class Administration, which are the subject\nof a separate award of costs. The Class Fund Attorneys' Fees come to a total of $4 million exclusive of costs\nawarded. The Court awards plaintiffs as costs and expenses an amount of $90,052.26 to Litt, Estuar, et al. plus\nan amount not to exceed $500 to Class Counsel William Claiborne. Class Counsel may submit additional\nrequests for expenses (but not fees) if Class Counsel incur additional costs in verifying claims of class members\nand putative class members as provided herein. The handling of the immediate and subsequent payment of\ncosts to Rosenthal is addressed at ¶ 22 below. The basis for the Court's award is explained in ¶ 34. All of the\nforegoing amounts are to be paid exclusively out of the Settlement Funds without additional contribution or\npayment by Defendant.\nClass Administrator\n21. The Court reaffirms the appointment of Rosenthal & Company as Class Administrator (hereby \"Rosenthal\").\nThe Court authorizes the payment, to be made by the District, to the extent it has not already been paid, of\n$201,224.46 to cover its expenses through January 6, 2006. When and if the class distribution goes forward (i.e.,\n\nif there is no appeal or there is an appeal and the settlement is approved at the appellate level), then Rosenthal\nwill receive all the funds remaining after the $3 Million reversion, and payment of the award of attorney's fees and\ncosts described in the preceding paragraph. Rosenthal will distribute the funds to the Named Plaintiffs as directed\nby Class Counsel. In light of the additional work entailed in reviewing hard copy records to address disputed\nclaims contending that the computer record is incorrect and to analyze the claims of those who did not use pre-\nprinted claim forms, which work was not fully included in Rosenthal's estimate of an additional approximately\n$150,000 in class administration expenses, Rosenthal is authorized to use up to $200,000 in additional money for\n82 further costs of Class Administration without further order of court. All funds provided to *82 Rosenthal will be\ndistributed to class members who filed timely class claims as discussed below, except to the extent that this\nOrder has authorized the use of such funds for costs and expenses.\nAllocation and Distribution Plan\n22. The Court approves the Allocation and Distribution Plan set forth herein, and directs the. Class Administrator\nto distribute the Class Fund in the manner provided herein.\n23. The Administrator shall scale the claims based upon the point system described herein. The Administrator\nshall compute the number of points due to each Plaintiff, and divide each Plaintiff's number of points into the total\nnumber of points to determine each Plaintiff's proportionate share of the Class Distribution. Each individual shall\nreceive the highest point category for which s/he qualifies. To limit the potential effect of multiple arrests and strip\nsearches on the point calculation, no person may receive more than 75 points for their total strip search points.\n24. The meaning of each term used above is defined in the following paragraph.\n00 First Offender 00 The arrest at issue was the first arrest of the individual based upon the District\n95 97\nof Columbia' Records, including Superior Court records. In the absence of a record showing a\nprior offense, the individual shall be treated as a first offender.\n00 Repeat Offender 00 The arrest at issue was not the first arrest of the individual based upon the\n95 97\nDistrict of Columbia' Records, including Superior Court records.\n00 Violence 00 The matter on which the individual was arrested was an offense that involved\n95 97\nviolence or weapons.\n00 Prostitution 00 The matter on which the individual was arrested involved a charge of prostitution.\n95 97\n00 Drugs 00 The matter on which the individual was arrested involved possession and/or sale of\n95 97\ndrugs.\n25. As used above, the term \"arrest\" refers to the most serious charge identifiable from a) the JACCS\n(Department of Corrections computerized inmate management system) database, and b) the Superior Court for\nthe District of Columbia Database (the \"CIS\" database).\n26. Each Plaintiff's points are to be based exclusively upon information obtained from the District of Columbia's\nrecords (including the District of Columbia Superior Court records). The total points will be divided into the\navailable funds, so that a value per point is determined. Each Plaintiff will receive the value of his or her points,\nexcept no Plaintiff will receive less than $50.\n27. As of January 11, 2006, the Class Administrator has received a total of 89 00 claims after the December 23\n97\ndeadline to file claims (and 3674 claims postmarked within the December 23 deadline). The court will accept all\nthese claims. Additional claims will be accepted until February 28, 2006. Any claim postmarked after February 28,\n2006, will not be accepted, and no exceptions shall be allowed. Each person submitting a claim after February\n28, 2006, will be sent a letter informing them that their claim is time-barred, and that the claim will not be\nconsidered regardless of the reason or circumstance. The Class Administrator shall prominently post this\ninformation on the website established for this case as soon as is practicable after entry of this Order.\n28. Except for the deposit into the Settlement Funds required by this Order, the District of Columbia will have no\n83 further *83 obligations or duties or liability whatsoever with respect to the Settlement Funds except with respect to\n\nthe reversion amount used to fund the injunctive relief claims. The District of Columbia has expressly made a\ncondition of this settlement that it has no involvement in the class distribution to Claimants.\n29. Plaintiffs, in conjunction with the Class Administrator, will undertake all allocation and administrative\nresponsibilities for the settlement consistent with the system of distribution that is approved by the Court. The\nClass Administrator shall use its best efforts to distribute the settlement amount in such a way as to insure that no\nresidual amount of money will remain following final distribution, as is discussed in greater detail in ¶ 18, supra.\nAfter these efforts to distribute the Settlement Funds to class members who have filed claims have been\nexhausted, any residual amount still remaining will revert to the District of Columbia, as is also discussed in ¶ 18.\n30. At the conclusion of the Class Distribution, which the Court anticipates will be over one year from the time of\nthis Order, the Class Administrator and/or Class Counsel shall submit a report to the court summarizing the\npayments made to the Class, and seeking from the class fund any final administrative costs to be approved\nbeyond the amounts previously authorized.\n31. Plaintiffs requested injunctive relief as part of the complaint. The parties agreed that $3 million of the $12\nmillion payment referenced above would revert to the D.C. Department of Corrections to be spent on programs\nand services which relate to the subject of this complaint (the \"reversion fund\"). These funds may be spent on\nnew staff, services, construction, technology, equipment, programs or other activities otherwise necessary to\nimprove or assist in processing inmates for release and to reduce incidents of over-detention and the need to\nstrip search, without individualized suspicion, inmates who meet the definition of the strip search class. The\nreversion fund exists to fund the injunctive relief changes necessary to eliminate the over-detentions and strips\nsearches that are the subject of this lawsuit and will be for new programs or activities not previously budgeted\n(and specifically not as a part of the general budget).\n32. The reversion funds shall be spent as follows:\nThe Department of Corrections (DOC) shall use the $3 million in settlement money to build a state\nof the art Inmate Processing Center (IPC) within the foot print of the DC Jail site, which will be a\nproject totaling approximately $5 Million. The additional $2 million required to complete the project\nwill be provided by the District government.\nThe purpose of the Inmate Processing Center (\"IPC\") will be to provide adequate processing\nfacilities for intakes and releases, and associated records processing. The IPC will:\n00 Include required processing space, stations, and protocols for new system intakes, inmates\n95\nreturning from court hearings with legal matters pending, inmates returning from court post\nsentencing, and inmates returning from court with dismissed charges and no legal matters\npending. The processing stations will be set up in a logical flow allowing for booking the inmate,\ncollection of property and funds, required searches, risk assessment and classification, generation\nof photographs and id wristbands, distribution of clothing, establishment of required accounts,\norientation, and dissemination of rules and regulations. Court ordered releases will be separated\n84 from inmates to be held in custody. *84 The Center may provide for pre-release counseling\nstations as well, offering job, education and referrals to community and governmental resources.\nThe Center's capacity will be sufficient to adjust operational work stations to match changing\ndemand patterns. DOC's goal is to create a processing environment that is more humane and\nbusiness-like in appearance.\n00 Incorporate \"boss chairs\" and other non-invasive detection technologies in the process flow with\n95\nthe goal of minimizing physical contact and providing for clothed body searches, except where\nevidence warrants a search. The focus would be on detecting metals, explosives, drugs and other\ncontraband.\n00 Utilize technology aided inmate property management whereby inmates' property will be digitally\n95\nphotographed prior to storage, and inmates will be given a receipt for property retrieval upon\nrelease.\n\n00 Contain space for inmate records processing so this function is seamlessly integrated with the\n95\nnew Inmate Processing Center.\n00 Take advantage of positive id technology at system intake and release points to verify the\n95\nidentity of individuals prior to intake and release.\nExisting staff and computer equipment will be re-located to the IPC. DOC expects the IPC to yield\nsubstantial operational benefits as a result of the co-location of interdependent intake/release\nfunctions and the logical process flow layout of the Center. In an effort to strengthen IPC\noperations still further, DOC is requesting capital funds in FY 07 to install a wireless LAN at the\nDC Jail and an RFID system. The latter system will allow DOC to track inmate movements and\nlocations electronically, conduct real-time counts, and assure positive identification.\n33. Except as otherwise provided in this Order, each party shall bear its own costs, expenses and attorneys' fees.\n34. The basis of the award of attorney's fees and costs contained in ¶ 20 is as follows:\na. Class Counsel engaged in protracted efforts over a period of four years to obtain this\nsettlement, which the Court considers to be an outstanding settlement both in its monetary and in\nits non-monetary terms. The court considers the results in this case to have been exceptional.\nb. This was complex litigation, involving novel issues, and the effort that went into the results\nreflects that fact. There is extensive documentation of the time spent by counsel to attest to the\nsubstantial effort that went into this case, and the Court has reviewed the file, which also reflects\nthe extensive work performed on both sides. Extraordinary effort went into the resolution of these\ncases, not only through litigation, but through many hours of mediation. These cases were hotly\ncontested both on their merits and on whether a class would be certified. In addition, there are\nunique challenges in litigating against the District of Columbia, of which the Court is well aware.\nc. The outcome of this case was unclear and subject to serious risk of lack of success at the time\nthe cases were filed, and during the course of the litigation. The Court is aware that cases of this\nnature are extremely risky and burdensome for plaintiffs' counsel.\n85 *85 d. Class counsel did an outstanding job and obtained exceptional results for the class. The\nhourly rates defined in Exhibit A do not account for exceptional results, and are based on hourly\nrates for lawyers of the skill and expertise of Class Counsel independent of the results obtained\nand of any contingent risk. In determining the appropriate fee, the Court has considered the\noutstanding results as well as the risks involved in this litigation.\ne. The Court considers that substantial benefits were conferred on the class beyond the monetary\nrecovery for the class, in the form of the significant policy changes in the operation of the\nDepartment of Corrections that resulted from this litigation. This is a substantial factor in the\nCourt's determination of the appropriate fee. The policy achievements obtained through this\nlitigation set it apart from many class fund cases, which provide only monetary relief. Here, in\naddition to the monetary relief to the class directly, the District committed to an additional $3\nMillion to spend on the jail, and will spend an additional $2 million more. Further, the policy of strip\nsearching court returnees subject to release has been stopped as a direct result of this litigation.\nf. The attorneys involved in this litigation on behalf of the class are experienced and capable civil\nrights attorneys. The Court finds the hourly rates contained in the fee petition, based on the\nmodified Laffey matrix, reasonable for attorneys of their skill, experience, reputation and expertise,\nbefore accounting for outstanding results or contingent risk. The Court also finds the hours\nexpended (which are also set forth in the Fee Petition) reasonable for litigation of this complexity\nand duration.\n\ng. The Court notes that there was a total of three opt outs and two objections, which the Court\nconsiders low and to reflect the overwhelming satisfaction of the class with the settlement and the\nClass Counsel.\nh. The Court considered the comments and objections of class members to the request for\nattorney's fees and concluded that only as of the time of the Final Fairness Hearing one of the\ncomments, the one filed by Mr. Jones, qualified as an objection, and Mr. Jones withdrew that\nobjection as to attorneys' fees at the Final Approval Hearing. Further, for the reasons stated, the\nCourt has affirmatively concluded that a fee of 1/3 of the Class Fund of $12,000,000, plus costs, is\nappropriate.\ni. A 1/3 fee is within the range of what is customarily awarded in this District. Chief Judge Hogan of\nthis District found that the presence of the following factors warranted the higher fee award of 34%\nin Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 2001 WL 34312839, *4, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25067, 36\n(D.D.C.2001): exceptional benefits to a large class; the experience, skill and professionalism of\ncounsel and the performance and quality of opposing counsel; the litigation was \"far ahead of\npublic agencies . . . which long after the institution of this litigation awakened to the concerns that\nplaintiffs' counsel first identified;\" extensive time and effort exerted by the attorneys and the\nexistence of complex legal and factual issues. These factors are present in this case. In addition,\n86 the court *86 noes that the percentage fee awarded in the very similar Williams v. County of Los\nAngeles case exceeded one third.\nj. The Court believes that the foregoing cost and fee award is reasonable in light of all the factors\ninvolved, including the complexity of the case, the novelty of the legal issues, the exceptional\nefforts made by Class Counsel, the exceptional results obtained by Class Counsel, the\noutstanding monetary and non-monetary benefits visited upon the Class and the community at\nlarge through Class Counsel's efforts, the risky nature of the litigation for which Class Counsel\nreceived no compensation during the many years of litigation, and the market expectation in the\nlegal market for an enhancement in contingent fee cases to compensate for litigation risk.\n35. The use of the masculine gender herein is construed to include the feminine and/or the neuter where\napplicable. The use of the singular herein is to be construed to include the plural where applicable. The use of the\nplural herein shall be construed to include the singular where applicable.\n36. The Court reserves and maintains jurisdiction over this settlement and its provisions, and over the claims\nadministration and distribution of the funds. Disagreements between the parties on any disputes or unresolved\naspects of this Order shall be subject to mediation before the mediator who has mediated this case to date. If\nmediation is not successful, the matter shall be brought to this Court for resolution.\n37. The Class Administrator shall distribute the funds within 90 days of either the last day to file a claim form, or\nthe time that the settlement funds are deposited with the Class Administrator, whichever is later. The Class\nAdministrator may have an additional period of time not to exceed 90 days upon the filing of a declaration with\nthe court setting forth the additional time needed and the reasons therefore.\n38. The monetary relief provided for in the Settlement Agreement shall compensate for all alleged violations of\nrights and all claims and any other incidents of incarceration by the plaintiff class members that were or could\nhave been brought in this civil action under any theory of liability for any claims related to allegedly unlawful over-\ndetentions and strip searches, except as to monetary damages for those class members who choose to opt out.\n39.
