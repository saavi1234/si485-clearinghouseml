    "summary": "<p>On June 22, 2005, attorneys for the local ACLU and the ACLU National Prison Project filed a class-action &sect; 1983 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi on behalf of inmates confined in Unit 32 of the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi. The lawsuit alleged dangerous and inhumane conditions of confinement in Unit 32, a \"supermax\" facility operated by the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). The plaintiffs immediately moved for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>The MDOC was already operating under an injunction issued in <a href=\"../../../../case/799/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russell v. Johnson</a> which concerned conditions of confinement and medical and mental health treatment for the subclass of death row prisoners confined to Unit 32. Magistrate Judge Jerry A. Davis, who oversaw the Russell case, urged the parties to discuss settlement. Following protracted negotiations, the parties reached a settlement of the issues in the form of a proposed consent decree. After a fairness hearing on April 28, 2006, Judge Davis formally approved the settlement.</p>\r\n<p>The consent decree called for the MDOC to make many changes to the conditions of confinement for non-death row inmates of Unit 32, including compliance with the ACA Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions (4th Ed.) and with the essential National Commission on Correctional Healthcare (NCCHC) Standards for Health Services in Prison (2003).</p>\r\n<p>Following the entry of the consent decree, the plaintiffs began monitoring the implementation process. Experts employed by the plaintiffs, Dr. John Robertson (medical expert) and Dr. Terry Kupers (mental health expert), conducted an audit of the medical and mental health services in Unit 32. The experts identified continuing deficiencies which they believed warranted urgent correction. The plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt on November 21, 2006, seeking an order to compel defendants to immediately comply with the medical and mental health care provisions of the consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2007, Judge Davis called the case for an evidentiary hearing on the plaintiffs' motion to compel. Before the hearing began, the State agreed to entry of a supplemental consent decree on medical care. The hearing went forward on the plaintiffs' contentions that mentally ill prisoners were still being denied basic psychiatric care and routinely subjected to excessive force and abuse. The hearing was adjourned and the parties were directed to discuss settlement of the remaining issues.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reset for a settlement conference and continuation of the contempt hearing on November 15, 2007. Following that conference, the parties arrived at a supplemental consent decree on mental health care, use of force, and classification, which supplemented the original consent decree entered April 28, 2006 and the supplemental consent decree on medical care entered April 16, 2007. On November 15, 2007, the parties entered into another supplemental consent decree on mental health care, use of force, and classification.</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2008, Judge Davis denied the plaintiffs' motions for discovery and attorneys' fees as moot.</p>\r\n<p>On August 2, 2010, Judge Davis ordered the case dismissed without prejudice by agreement of the parties. The defendants agreed to close Unit 32, transfer the entire population of Unit 32 to other facilities over the course of the next several months, move all seriously mentally ill prisoners to MDOC's mental health facility in Meridian, MS and remedy the inadequate medical and mental health care in Unit 32 so long as any prisoners remain there. As part of the agreement, the ACLU would also monitor during the next year the medical and mental health care provided at all of the facilities in the state to which Unit 32 prisoners were transferred to ensure they meet constitutional requirements.</p>\r\n<p>On November 12, 2010, Judge Davis denied one of the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees upon being advised by the parties that the issue of attorneys' fees had been resolved. On January 14, 2011, Judge Davis issued a stipulated order awarding the plaintiffs $295,000 fees and expenses.</p>\r\n<p>Disputes over attorneys' fees continued until January 13, 2012, when the parties settled but did not disclose the details of the settlement.</p>",

The Parties\nstipulated that the remedies set forth in the Consent Decree were narrowly drawn, extended no\nfurther than necessary to correct the violations of Plaintiffs’ federal rights, and were the least\nintrusive means necessary to correct those violations. The Court retained  jurisdiction to enforce the\nprovisions  of  this  Consent  Decree.  Plaintiffs  thereafter  proceeded  to  monitor  Defendants’\ncompliance.  \nAmong the most urgent of the many pressing issues addressed by the Consent Decree were\nthose relating to medical and mental health care.1  During pre-settlement discovery, Plaintiffs’\n1\nParagraphs 6 of the Consent decree provides that Defendants “shall comply, and shall ensure that\ntheir    medical  services  provider  complies”  with  the  mandatory  ACA  Standards  for  Adult\nCorrectional Institutions (4th Ed.) and with the essential National Commission on Correctional\nHealthcare (NCCHC) Standards for Health Services in Prison (2003);” that Plaintiffs’ expert will\nperiodically audit the provision of care, and will  furnish Defendants with a report identifying\ndeficiencies; and that Defendants will submit a written plan to address any such deficiencies.  In\naddition, Defendants are to ensure compliance with ACA Standard 4-4345 on medical co-payment\nfees; provide a chronic disease program that adequately identifies, monitors and treats patients with\nchronic diseases, consistent with NCCHC and ACA standards;  ensure compliance with NCCHC\nand ACA and community standards on medical record-keeping;  and provide off-site medical\nconsultation, hospitalization, and specialty care for patients in need of those services, consistent with\nNCCHC and ACA Standards.  Paragraph 7 of the Decree provides that “[e]ach prisoner confined to\nUnit 32 for at least a year shall be given a comprehensive mental health examination in private”\nannually; that “prisoners  diagnosed with psychosis and severe mental health illnesses shall be\nhoused separately and apart from all other prisoners and shall be housed appropriately in light of\ntheir individual treatment plans consistent with NCCHC Standard P-G-01 [Special Needs Treatment\nPlans]” that “medication levels of all prisoners receiving psychotropic medications shall be\nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  2\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 3 of 16(cid:10)\nmedical expert Dr. John Robertson and their mental health expert Dr. Terry Kupers identified\nsystemic deficiencies in medical and mental health care that were causing needless acute suffering,\nlife-threatening injuries, imminent risks of injury, and poor  medical outcomes, many of an\nirreversible nature.  Consequently, one of Plaintiffs’ highest priorities has been to collaborate with\nDefendants in attempting to resolve those deficiencies.    \nDefendants  have  shown  an  interest  in  exploring  the  possibilities  of  collaboration.\nCommissioner Epps and Deputy Commissioner Sparkman have authorized  MDOC’s capable and\nconscientious Medical Director, Dr. Kentrell  Liddell, to communicate freely with Plaintiffs’ experts.\nMr. Epps and Mr. Sparkman recently agreed, as a demonstration of their good faith, to implement\nan important mental health remedial measure that had been urged  by Dr. Kupers (namely, to allow\nprisoners to control the light switch in their own cells).   Parchman Superintendent Kelly and Unit\n32 Warden Presley and their staff have fully accommodated Plaintiffs’ experts and counsel during\naudits.  Defendants’ counsel have made consistent efforts to facilitate collaboration between the\nparties.  \nUnfortunately, despite the good intentions to which those actions attest,  little substantive\nprogress has been achieved towards compliance with the medical and mental health provisions of\nthe Consent Decree.  Problems of the utmost urgency remain to be resolved and Defendants have\nnot taken the necessary steps to address those problems.  The history of the parties’ efforts since the\nmonitored and assessed in accordance with appropriate medical standards, and that “[a]ll prisoners\nreceiving mental health counseling or evaluation shall meet with the mental health professionals in\na private setting.” \nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  3\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 4 of 16(cid:10)\nentry of the Consent Decree shows that the Court’s intervention is required if the medical and mental\nhealth provisions are to be implemented and the Plaintiff class protected from further irreparable\ninjury.\n I. DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT’S \n   APRIL 28, 2006   ORDER\nHistory of the Parties’ Efforts to Achieve Compliance With Consent Decree \nOn May 16, 2006, shortly after the entry of the Consent Decree, Dr. Robertson and Plaintiffs’\ncounsel met with Dr. Liddell and Defendants’ counsel.  The goal of the meeting was to open a dialog\non reform of the medical and mental health care systems.  The parties agreed at this meeting upon\na process whereby Plaintiffs’ experts could communicate with Defendants’ experts in a timely way\nabout significant emerging medical and psychiatric issues in individual class members’ cases.  The\nparties also had a preliminary discussion on some of the most acute systemic problems identified by\nPlaintiffs’ experts.  One particularly urgent agenda item was to discuss the terms of MDOC’s\ncontract with its contract health care provider.  MDOC’s two-year contract with Correctional\nMedical Services, Inc. was due to expire on July 1, 2006, and MDOC was in active negotiations with\nbidders for the new contract.  Dr. Robertson, who has a decade of experience as the medical director\nfor two state correctional medical systems, offered to assist MDOC in reviewing the terms proposed\nby bidders to help ensure that the new contract would not disadvantage MDOC in providing\nadequate medical and mental health care to the Presley class.\nFor example, Dr. Robertson pointed out that  Wexford, Inc., sought terms that would allow\nWexford to provide far less staffing than required to meet the needs of the population at Parchman,\na six-month grace period to reach this already reduced level of staffing, and an additional 90 days\nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  4\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 5 of 16(cid:10)\nbefore any monetary penalties would go into effect.  Based on those terms, there would be a potential\nnine-month period of extreme under-staffing, which would inevitably result in severe negative\nmedical outcomes.    \nMDOC thereafter entered into a service contact with correctional health care service provider\nWexford, Inc,  effective July 1, 2006.  Unfortunately, the contract to which MDOC finally agreed\ncontained virtually all the terms which Dr.  Robertson had warned MDOC would significantly\nhandicap its ability to comply with the Consent Decree and to provide constitutionally adequate care\nto the prisoners.   \n In mid-July 2006, Dr. Robertson spent four days at Parchman meeting with MDOC and\nWexford medical staff and administrators, reviewing medical records, touring the on-site medical\nfacilities, and interviewing prisoners.  At the end of August 2006, Dr. Kupers joined Dr. Robertson\nat Parchman in an audit of medical and mental health care.  They  met with MDOC’s on-site health\ncare administrators as well as key medical staff for Wexford; they also reviewed medical and mental\nhealth records, toured Unit 32 and the Unit 42 medical unit, and interviewed prisoners.  On August\n31, 2006, Dr. Robertson and Dr. Kupers met at Department of Corrections headquarters in Jackson\nwith Deputy Commissioner Sparkman, Dr. Liddell, and MDOC’s counsel to brief them on the major\ndeficiencies they had found during the audit, and to engage in a collaborative exploration of possible\nremedies.  \nOn September 8, 2006, Dr. Robertson and Dr. Kupers followed up this discussion with written\nreports, in compliance with paragraph 6 of the Consent Decree.2 See September 8, 2006  Robertson\n2\n Paragraph 6 provides that “[w]ithin 30 working days of the completion of each audit, Plaintiffs will\nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  5\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 6 of 16(cid:10)\nReport (attached here as Exhibit B) and September 8, 2006 Kupers Report (attached here as Exhibit\nC).  The Reports outlined key findings, reiterated the urgent problems communicated to MDOC a\nweek earlier during the meeting in Jackson, and made recommendations to assist MDOC in\nachieving compliance with the Consent Decree. \nDeficiencies in Medical Care Identified in August 2006 Audit  \n        Dr. Robertson’s report gave priority to two items which he identified as being “of particular\nimportance and urgency,” namely, the inappropriate imposition of prisoner co-pay fees for medical\naccess and services, and the inadequacy of health care staffing. \nDr. Robertson found multiple documented instances of inappropriate co-pay billings for\nprisoners’ sick-call requests for symptoms related to diagnosed conditions under active treatment,\nin violation of the Consent Decree.  For example, Dr. Roberts found that MDOC charged the co-pay\nto known diabetics presenting with myriad symptoms of either dangerously high or low blood\nglucose levels; patients diagnosed Crohn’s Disease (an inflammatory disease of the intestine)\npresenting with rectal bleeding; HIV infected patients on treatment presenting with  symptoms of\nprogressive HIV disease; and prisoners requesting medication refills for previously prescribed\nmedications that had run out.\n  The problem was so pervasive that Dr. Robertson recommended that MDOC immediately\nsuspend the co-pay system at Unit 32 pending a study to ensure that the co-pay system is  functioning\nin compliance with NCCHC and ACA standards, that the written policy offers clear guidance to site\nfurnish Defendants and their medical care provider with a report identifying deficiencies, if any.\nWithin 45 working days after receipt of that report, Defendants will submit a written plan to address\nany such deficiencies.” \nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  6\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 7 of 16(cid:10)\nmedical staff, and that on-site medical staff have the training and understanding necessary to ensure\nthe policy is appropriately administered. \nDr. Robertson found a two-fold problem with medical staffing: inadequate training and\nexpertise of on-site medical staff, and an inadequate number of  full time employees providing\nservices.  For example, Dr. Robertson found that under the new contract with Wexford, there has\nbeen  a 47% reduction in the nursing staff , without any parallel reduction in the overall number of\npatients or their medical acuity. Dr. Robertson characterized this shortfall as “a completely\nunsustainable situation of crisis proportion.”   He also stressed his great concern that, despite his\nwarning,  MDOC had  entered into a contract with Wexford which essentially gives Wexford a six-\nmonth grace period to reach the staffing levels mandated by the contract, and an additional 90 days\nbefore  any monetary penalties would go into effect.  Dr. Robertson stated that “[t]he result of a\npotential nine-month period of extreme under-staffing puts the system at high risk to experience\nserious and medically significant shortfalls in health services delivery. .... For the prisoners, it\ninevitably means unnecessary suffering and exposure to the most severe negative medical outcomes.\nThe urgency of the situation cannot be sufficiently stressed.”   Dr. Robertson recommended that\nMDOC  immediately work with Wexford to set short-term, intermediate and strategic guidelines for\nstaffing and that MDOC rigorously monitor staffing patterns.\nIn addition to these two issues, Dr. Robertson identified many other major deficiencies,\nincluding failure to provide off-site consultations with specialists; failure to provide chronic disease\nmanagement; woefully substandard  medical record keeping; and, of critical importance, Defendants’\nfailure to provide MDOC’s Medical Director and her office of medical compliance with the essential\nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  7\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 8 of 16(cid:10)\ncentral-office support and on-site resources to allow her to properly monitor the contract with\nWexford and assure delivery of services.\nDr. Robertson supplemented his Report with a letter of the same date (Exhibit D), summarizing\nsome of the individual cases who were at serious risk because of the severe staffing shortfall and\nwho required close follow up (for example, a prisoner diagnosed with prostate cancer who was not\nreceiving treatment).  The requisite follow-up was not provided.\nDeficiencies in Mental Health Care Identified in August 2006 Audit  \nDr. Kupers’ report detailed an almost total failure of compliance with the mental health\nprovisions of the Consent Decree.  Essentially no progress has been made in complying with the key\nrequirement that prisoners  “diagnosed with psychosis and severe mental health illnesses shall be\nhoused separately and apart from all other prisoners and shall be housed appropriately in light of\ntheir individual treatment plans[.]” Severe under-staffing is crippling virtually every aspect of care.\nOnly a very small fraction of prisoners have received the annual psychiatric examinations mandated\nby the Consent Decree; services for mentally ill prisoners continue to be grossly lacking; crisis\ntreatment is “grossly substandard and unacceptable;” “there is absolutely no intermediate care\navailable to prisoners in Unit 32,”  and  there are insufficient professional staff to provide the\nnecessary outpatient care.   \nDr. Kupers found that  the psychiatric wings of the Unit 42 medical facility provided even\nworse conditions than Unit 32 for mentally ill patents in crisis.  It is commonplace for prisoners with\nserious mental illness to be issued disciplinary tickets for disturbed behaviors  that are obviously\ndriven by mental illness, and prisoners with mental illness are disproportionately subjected to use\nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  8\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 9 of 16(cid:10)\nof force, including immobilizing gas and cell extractions.  Dr. Kupers found that “a vicious cycle”\nhas been created, “wherein prisoners suffering from mental illness become more disturbed in isolated\nconfinement at Unit 32, their illness leads them to break rules – either they act out in response to\nhallucinated voices or they try to harm themselves – then they are subjected to use of force (gassing,\n[cell] extractions) and forced to undergo even harsher conditions such as the special management\nisolation cells where their mental illness is further exacerbated and they breakdown or attempt to\nharm themselves anew.”  He found that the current policy and practice of housing prisoners in\npsychiatric crises in “special management isolation cells,” where they are subjected to especially\nharsh restrictions and exaggerated isolation, “will predictably cause deterioration in the prisoners’\npsychiatric condition, likely accompanied by further misbehavior, ...  further punishments and no\neffective treatment.”  \nDr. Kupers found that communication between staff and mentally ill prisoners remains a\nserious problem.  There are no call buttons in the cells, and prisoners consistently report that the\ncustody staff do not make frequent rounds. In many cases, prisoners who have flooded the range or\nset fires explain that they did so because they could not figure out a better way to summon help.  Dr.\nKupers also found that prisoners’ lack of any control over the lights in their cell was exacerbating\nmental illness and intensifying the kind of despair that can lead to suicide attempts.  \nDr. Kupers recommended, among other things, that MDOC resolve staffing shortages; provide\nmore training for custody staff about mental illness and suicide; cease the use of  special\nmanagement isolation cells and additional deprivations to manage psychiatric crises; improve the\ncrisis care at Unit 42 by (at the very least) assigning a qualified full-time mental health care provider\nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  9\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 10 of 16(cid:10)\non Unit 42's psychiatric wing; and pursue any of the multiple available options for accomplishing\nthe objective of separating prisoners with mental illness from the other prisoners on Unit 32. \nDr. Kupers supplemented his report with a separate letter by letter dated September 15, 2006\n(Exhibit E) listing a number of acutely psychotic and suicidal prisoners needing urgent and ongoing\npsychiatric intervention and separation from the population at Unit 32.  Dr. Kupers requested that\nDefendants keep him informed as to their follow-up with these patients.  Although Defendants\nagreed to provide such follow-up information, they did not do so.  \nDefendants’ Response to the Monitors’ Reports and Recommendations  \nOn October 10, 2006, Defendants responded to Dr. Robertson’s and Dr. Kupers’ reports by\nletter captioned “MDOC Written Plan to Correct Alleged Deficiencies at Unit-32” (Exhibit F).   In\nvague and general terms, Defendants stated that MDOC had begun to review Sick Call requests  prior\nto charging a co-pay fee; that it would suspend co-pay (at some unspecified future time) if it found\nthat inmates are being charged unfairly ; that it had advised Wexford that no inmate should be charged\nfor  on-going, chronic or unresolved health care concerns; that Wexford “has presented a plan” to\naddress the problem of staff vacancies and that MDOC will continue to monitor staffing patterns;\nthat continuity of care with specialty consults has “significantly improved;” that  chronic disease\nmanagement “has improved significantly,” that a “significant reorganization of the medical record\nkeeping process is underway;” that Defendants do not feel call buttons or intercoms are warranted\nbecause “[w]e do standard 15 minute rounds everywhere and more frequently as required;”3 and that\n3Defendants’ statement reflects official policy, but the practice, according to consistent\nreports from the plaintiff class, is quite different. \nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  10\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 11 of 16(cid:10)\nMDOC “is in the process of developing a step-down unit for the mentally ill consistent with the\nparties prior discussions.”\nDefendants’ response to Dr. Kupers’ recommendation that prisoners be permitted to control\ntheir own cell light deserves special mention.  To show their good faith, Deputy Commissioner\nSparkman recommended to Commissioner Epps, and Commissioner Epps authorized, individual light\nswitches in each of the cells at Unit-32.4  This is a significant and welcome decision.     \nPlaintiffs’ Request to Defendants for a Genuine Corrective Action Plan\nOn October 19, 2006, Plaintiffs sent Defendants a response to MDOC’s Written Plan.  See\nExhibit F.  Plaintiffs’ monitors expressed their dismay  that “in its present form MDOC’s response\nprovide[ed] an inadequate basis for productive discussion, collaboration, and monitoring, and fails\nto meet the requirements of the consent decree in Presley v. Epps, which requires Defendants to\nsubmit a written plan to address any deficiencies identified in Plaintiffs’ post-audit reports.”  Plaintiffs\nnoted that  there is a broad  consensus among correctional health care professionals about the general\napproach and format for effective corrective action plans, and that  MDOC’s October 10 response did\nnot qualify as a genuine plan to correct deficiencies, since it neither listed specific tasks, assigned\nresponsibility for implementation, identified the resources  required for implementation, nor spelled\nout a time frame for implementation.   Plaintiffs explained that, at a minimum, a meaningful and\neffective corrective action plan must identify the problem requiring remedy; specify  the necessary\nremedial steps, spell out the resources required to implement the plan,  identify the key persons\n4Defendants have stated that they will attempt to implement this reform by January 2007.  \nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  11\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 12 of 16(cid:10)\nresponsible for implementation, and lay out an unambiguous time line for beginning implementation,\nintermediate steps, and full compliance.  \nDr. Robertson and Dr. Kupers offered to assist MDOC in developing an appropriate and\nresponsive corrective action plan to address the identified needs of the system.  Plaintiffs urged\nMDOC to  accept this offer of  assistance in the same spirit of cooperation in which it  was offered,\npointing out that Dr. Robertson and Dr. Kupers have many years of combined experience in helping\nto formulate and implement corrective action plans in correctional health care settings (in fact, Dr.\nRobertson’s experience includes ten years as medical director of two prison systems under court\noversight).  \nDefendants never responded to or otherwise acknowledged Plaintiffs’ offer to assist MDOC in\ncreating a corrective action plan to correct the deficiencies identified in the August 2006 audit.\nMeanwhile, class members continue to be seriously injured and their lives continue to be put at grave\nrisk by the deficiencies that Plaintiffs’ experts identified.  The Court’s intervention is required to\nassist the parties in implementing the Consent Decree and to protect the plaintiff class from further\nirreparable injury. \nII. DEFENDANTS’ CONDUCT WARRANTS SANCTIONS FOR CIVIL CONTEMPT  \n       “Federal courts are not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance. Once\nentered, a consent decree may be enforced.”  Frew v. Hawkins, 504 U.S. 431, 440 (2004).  A Court\nhas the “inherent power to enforce compliance with [its] lawful orders through civil  contempt.”\nSpallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276 (1990) (quoting Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364,\n370 (1966)).  The rules generally applicable to civil contempt apply with equal force to consent\nNovember 21, 2006 Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other\nEquitable Relief to Compel Defendants’ Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental\nHealth Care  12\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 58     Filed 11/21/2006     Page 13 of 16(cid:10)\ndecrees.   See United States v. City of Jackson, 359 F.3d at 732 (citing Frew v. Hawkins, 504 U.S. .at.\n440). \n“Sanctions for civil contempt are meant to be wholly remedial and serve to benefit the party\nwho has suffered injury or loss at the hands of the contemnor.”  Petroleos Mexicanos v. Crawford\nEnters.,  826 F.2d 392, 399 (5th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The purpose of a civil\ncontempt sanction is “to coerce the contemnor into compliance with a court order, or to compensate\nanother party for the contemnor's violation.” Lamar Fin. Corp. v. Adams, 918 F.2d 564, 566 (5th\nCir.1990).  \nIn a civil contempt proceeding, “the movant must establish by clear and convincing evidence\nthat (1) a court order was in effect, (2) the order required specified conduct by the respondent, and\n(3) the respondent failed to comply with the court's order.  United States v. City of Jackson,\nMississippi, 359 F.3d 727, 731 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Allied Pilots Ass'n, 228\nF.3d 574, 581 (5th Cir.2000)).  The issue is whether a party is in compliance with a court order, not\nwhether the party acted in good faith. The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that good  faith is not\na defense to a finding of civil contempt.   See City of Jackson at 735 (collecting cases); see also\nMcComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. 187, 191 (1949) (“The absence of wilfulness does not\nrelieve from civil contempt ... .  Since the purpose is remedial, it matters not with what intent the\ndefendant did the prohibited act.”).5    \n5\nOf course, “[w]here compliance is impossible, neither the moving party nor the court has any reason\nto proceed with the civil contempt action. It is settled, however, that in raising this defense, the\ndefendant has a burden of production.”  United States  v. Rylander,   460 U.S. 752, 757 (1983)\n(citing McPhaul v. United States, 364 U.S. 372, 379 (1960); Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S.  56 , 75-76\n(1948);  Oriel v. Russell,  278 U.S. 358, 366 (1929)).

As set forth in the\nreports of Plaintiffs’  monitors, and as the testimony and documentary evidence presented at hearing\nwill prove, Defendants have failed to comply with the medical and mental health provisions of the\nApril 28 Decree.   The deficiencies in Defendants’ system for delivering medical and mental health\ncare and their treatment of mentally ill prisoners have produced a completely unsustainable situation\nof crisis proportion.\nCONCLUSION \nThe Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court set this motion for evidentiary hearing; enter\nfindings following hearing that Defendants have failed to comply with the Consent Decree’s\nprovisions on medical and mental health care; hold Defendants in civil contempt of the Court’s April\n28 Decree; and direct that Defendants purge themselves of the contempt by promptly accomplishing\nthe following: \nResolve medical staffing shortages; \nSuspend prisoner co-pay charges;   \nSeparate prisoners with mental illness from the other prisoners on Unit 32; \nAssign a qualified full-time mental health care provider to Unit 42 (the MSP in-patient unit);\nCease the use of  special management isolation cells to manage psychiatric crises; and\nIn collaboration with the Plaintiffs and their experts, formulate meaningful corrective action\nplans for each of the deficiencies identified in the experts’ audit reports, setting forth specific tasks;\noffering evidence that compliance is impossible by offering evidence or denials which the court finds\nincredible in context.

This  class  action  is brought by prisoners  confined in Unit 32  of Mississippi  State \nPenitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi.  A supermaximum security facility, Unit 32 is a massive \ncomplex of five buildings housing about 1000 men, almost all of them in segregation cells where \n1 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 2 of 20\nthey are locked down 23 to 24 hours a day, in total isolation. The conditions of confinement in Unit \n32 are so barbaric, the deprivation of medical and mental health care so extreme, and the defects in \nsecurity so severe, that the lives and health ofthe men confined there-and the correctional staff who \nwork there - are at great and imminent risk. \n2.  Although Mississippi prison officials claim that they use Unit 32 to incarcerate the most \ndangerous and incorrigible offenders in the State, in the most secure and restrictive setting possible, \nthe reality is quite different.  The majority of the men housed in Unit 32-for years, sometimes for \ndecades-do not have the kind of criminal history or institutional conduct that justifies incarceration \nunder \"supermax\" conditions.  Many prisoners were placed in Unit 32 for purely arbitrary reasons, \nor for no discernible reason at all, and have never had a meaningful opportunity to contest their \nplacement there.  Many are confined there because they are HIV- positive, have special medical \nneeds, are severely mentally ill, or have requested protective custody.  Even for those men whose \nhistory might warrant the most highly restrictive custody, there is no justification whatsoever for the \nhorrifically brutal and dangerous conditions to which they are knowingly subjected by Defendant \nprison officials and their medical services contractors. \n3.  These conditions include profound isolation and unrelieved idleness; pervasive filth and \nstench; malfunctioning plumbing and constant exposure to human excrement; lethal extremes of \nheat and humidity; uncontrolled infestations of mosquitoes, spiders, horseflies and other insects; \ngrossly inadequate medical, mental health and dental care; the routine use by security staff of \nexcessive force; and the constant pandemonium, night and day, of severely mentally ill prisoners \nscreaming, raving and hallucinating in nearby cells.  Security staffing in Unit 32 is so dangerously \ninadequate and incompetent that prison gang leaders, housed in other areas of Mississippi State \n2 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 3 of 20\nPenitentiary but assigned to work in Unit 32, are able to freely transact their gang business and \nrecruit corrupt corrections officers to facilitate gang-related drug transactions, prostitution rings and \nextortion schemes. \n4.  All of these conditions, separately and in combination, cause those who live in Unit 32 \nintense suffering, and put them at substantial risk of physical injury, illness and premature death. \nThese conditions are likely to cause serious mental illness to emerge in previously healthy prisoners, \nand psychosis, mania and mental breakdown to afflict less healthy prisoners.  As a result of these \ndeprivations, Unit 32 is a tinder-box-a catastrophe waiting to happen. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under color of state law \nof rights, privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States.  The rights \nsought to be redressed are guaranteed by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution.  The Court has federal question jurisdiction over this controversy under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343. \n6.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Mississippi under 28 U.S.C.  § 1391.  The \nPlaintiffs are incarcerated there, the acts complained of occurred there, and some of the Defendants \nwork there. \nPARTIES \n7.

Unit 32 prisoners live in almost total isolation from other human beings and in a state of \nperpetual forced idleness.  The men are confined to their cells for 23 to 24 hours a day, except for \n5 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 6 of 20\nfive-minute showers three times a week and sporadic access to an outdoor exercise cage scarcely \nlarger than a cell, in which they must remain fully shackled in hand-cuffs, leg-irons and waist-chains. \nDefendants routinely cancel even this absurdly limited opportunity for exercise.  They  actively \ndiscourage prisoners from going outside by subjecting them to arbitrary strip-searches and cell \nshakedowns before yard-call.  The vast majority ofUnit 32 prisoners have no access to educational \nor vocational programs, prison jobs, religious services or fellowship, social interaction with other \nprisoners, or even such solitary pastimes as playing cards or hobby crafts.  The men are permitted, \nat best, only two books from the library every three to four months and must wait months to \nexchange a single book. \n22.  Other than on death row, the men in Unit 32 are not permitted radios or televisions. \nDefendants have removed the built-in writing tables attached to the wall that were intended for \nwriting and drawing.  Reading, writing or any kind of sustained or focused thought is virtually \nimpossible due to the constant screams, moans, curses, animal noises, maniacal laughter and \nhallucinatory ravings of severely mentally ill prisoners in adjacent cells, and because ofthe collective \ndin of prisoners pounding on cell bars and door frames-their only means to attract the attention of \ncorrections officers. \n23.  The profound and long-term isolation, idleness, monotony and lack of exercise cause severe \ndeterioration of prisoners' mental and physical health.  Those who remain in Unit 32 for any \nsignificant length of time-and many remain for years, even decades-spiral into mental illness and \ndespair.  In this weakened condition, even the most self-controlled and rational prisoners become \nincreasingly unable to control their responses to the noxious conditions in Unit 32. \n6 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 7 of 20\nDaneerously Deficient Security and Excessive Force \n24.  Chronic and severe shortages in security staffing and Defendants' failure to adequately train \nand supervise security staff put the lives of prisoners and prison employees in Unit 32 in constant \nperil.  Corrections officers do not follow basic security precautions, and because security is so lax, \nprisoner-on-prisoner violence is commonplace.  Some corrections officers sadistically bait and \nthreaten prisoners, or gratuitously beat prisoners already in full restraint gear.  If a Unit 32 prisoner \nexpresses suicidal thoughts or needs to be moved for other reasons, \"takedown teams\" of four or five \nofficers often forcibly extract the shackled prisoner from his cell, spray him with a chemical agent \nthat causes vomiting and shortness ofbreath, and then assault him. \n25.  Sadistic abuse and excessive force by corrections staff create a serious risk of suicide in \nyoung or mentally ill prisoners.  On November 24, 2003, Christopher Smiley, a youthful prisoner \non psychiatric medications, threw a glass ofw  ater at a corrections officer. The officer screamed that \nshe was going to kill him, and a take-down team of several officers was summoned.  The officers \ngassed Smiley and - after putting him in full restraint gear-pushed, punched and dragged him into \na hallway, where they severely beat him.  Smiley was taken to a holding tank and then brought back \nto a punishment cell on the tier, where he spent the following night without any clothing or bedding, \nalthough the temperature dropped below freezing.  Officers refused to give him his psychiatric \nmedications and denied him several meals. The following day, on November 26, an officer told him \n\"you'd better be gone when I come to work tonight.\" Smiley told ranking officers about the beating \nand threats and begged to be moved.  They told him to set a fire if he wanted to be moved.  That \nnight, Smiley was found dead in his cell, hanging in the comer near the sink.  A few weeks later, on \n7 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 8 of 20\nDecember 16, 2003, Patrick Presley, a prisoner who was in Unit 32 simply because he needed \nprotective custody, was found hanged in his cell. \n26.  Prison gang leaders housed in other Units and assigned to work in Unit 32 take advantage \nof the lax security to freely transact gang business on the Unit.  They recruit corrections officers to \nact as mail couriers, supply cell phones, and otherwise facilitate gang-related drug transactions, \nprostitution rings and extortion schemes. Some officers leave their posts to engage in sex with gang \nleaders. At least one officer has allowed a gang member to rifle through a sack of outgoing prisoner \nmail. \n27.  Staff shortages, staff incompetency and staff corruption have a disastrous effect on virtually \nevery aspect of confinement in Unit 32 and contribute significantly to prisoners' lack of access to \nemergency medical and mental health care, to the intolerable level of filth and noise in the Unit, and \nto the vicious cycle of arbitrary punishment, frustration and despair that traps prisoners. \nGrossly Inadequate Sanitation \n28.  Defendants expose Unit 32 prisoners to grossly unsanitary living conditions and deprive \nthem of the means to maintain basic personal hygiene.  This severe lack of sanitation makes the \nprisoners extremely susceptible to drug-resistant staph infection (MRSA), a highly contagious \nbacteria that rapidly spreads in institutional settings through dirty laundry and unsanitized surfaces. \nMRSA causes skin infections and boils and can lead to serious complications such as deep abscesses, \npneumonia, endocarditis (infection of the heart), meningitis, bone infection and blood infection. \nMRSA is rampant in Unit 32 as it is in other Units at Parchman. The MSP infirmary at Unit 42 sees \ndozens of admissions for staph infections each month-at least one or two each day-many of them \nfrom Unit 32. \n8 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 9 of 20\n29.  The plumbing is dysfunctional throughout Unit 32: almost every cell has a \"ping-pong\" toilet \nthat pushes excrement and waste into the bowl in the adjoining cell when flushed.  Cells, hallways \nand showers in Unit 32 are chronically filthy.  An overwhelmingly strong stench pervades the Unit \n- some of it from filth on the tier, some of it from a cesspool adjacent to the buildings, some of it \nfrom the defective plumbing and ping-pong toilets, some of it caused by regular flooding that \ndrenches prisoners' cells and soaks their mattresses and bedding with dirty water that is allowed to \nstand for days at a time. \n30.  Severely mentally ill prisoners throw food and excrement on the floor of their cells and into \nthe hallways, which prison staff allow to decompose for days or even weeks.  Correctional staff \nallow severely mentally ill prisoners to go without showers and to leave their toilets unflushed for \nweeks at a time, subjecting all other prisoners to the stench. \n31.  The Unit  is  virtually never disinfected  or  given  any kind  of  meaningful  cleaning. \nCorrectional staff do not supervise the trusty prisoners assigned to clean the showers and halls, and \nrarely provide prisoners with supplies to clean their own cells, or else provide only filthy water and \none bottle of disinfectant to clean scores of cells and toilets on multiple tiers.  Many Unit 32 \nprisoners are routinely moved from cell to cell and forced to occupy cells left in horrendous \ncondition by previous occupants who are mentally ill. Adequate cleaning supplies and equipment \nare not made available, so the new occupant must use his shower soap, towel and tee shirt to clean \nup the filth as best he can. \n32.  Unit 32 prisoners have no way ofa dequately cleaning their bedding and clothes, making them \nspecially vulnerable to drug-resistant staph infection.  When bedding and clothing is sent to the \nprison laundry, it comes back stained, damp and foul-smelling. If prisoners attempt to do their own \n9 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 10 of 20\nlaundry in their cells (in violation ofp rison rules), they have no way of getting it clean and dry. They \nare given no change of sheets or bedding; when their bedding is wet or at the laundry, they must \nsleep on a bare, dirty plastic mattress. \n33.  Unit 32 prisoners are routinely served dangerously unsanitary food.  The carts holding the \nstacked food trays are filthy; and the trays on which the food is served are cracked, encrusted with \nresidue from other prisoners' meals, littered with insects, and soiled with bird droppings.  The food \ntrays are often left for hours in the hot sun before being served, causing the food to spoil.  Sudden \nbouts of vomiting and diarrhea, likely caused by contaminated or spoiled food, afflict prisoners on \na regular basis after meal service in Unit 32. \n34.  The air in Unit 32 is dank.  Water pours into the cells from the outside when it rains. When \nmentally ill or disturbed prisoners flood their toilets, a frequent occurrence, the beds and clothing \nof prisoners in the cells below become soaked with water and waste.  There are no floor drains in \nUnit 32 cells, and the prisoners are not given supplies to mop up the waste water; so the men are \nforced to live in foul standing water for prolonged periods, and endure their filthy soaked bedding \nand clothes until the next laundry day. \nDaneerously Inadequate Shelter \n35.  The cells in Unit 32 provide inadequate shelter for the prisoners, who are confined to them \nfor 23 to 24 hours a day.  In wet weather, rain floods many ofthe cells, and in freezing weather the \ncells are very cold.  From May to October, when the air temperature at Parchman routinely exceeds \n90 degrees Fahrenheit for days at a time, often with extremely high humidity, the cells become \ndangerously hot and airless. \n10 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 11 of 20\n36.  Cell ventilation is grossly inadequate. The large blowers stationed at the entrance to each tier \nprovide virtually no air movement or cross-ventilation inside the cells, particularly those at the \nopposite end of the tier. \n37.  From May through September, Unit 32 swarms with clouds of mosquitoes, gnats, horseflies \nand many other insects, which breed and harass prisoners every moment of the day and night. \nSwarms ofbeetles, mosquitoes and other insects cover the prisoners' bodies and enter their food and \nwater.  The mosquito and insect infestation is so severe that prisoners are forced, despite the \nsweltering heat, to close their windows and cover themselves entirely with clothes and bedding. \n38.  Cell temperatures in Unit 32 routinely reach well above 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the \nsummer months, and the heat index soars well above 100 degrees.  Prolonged exposure to high \nambient temperatures and humidity poses a life-threatening medical risk.  Heat-stroke is a medical \nemergency which, unless promptly and energetically treated, can result in convulsions, renal failure, \ncirculatory collapse, permanent brain damage, or death.  Excessive heat exposure also seriously \nexacerbates many preexisting respiratory, circulatory and other chronic illnesses. \n39.  The primary risk factors for heat-stroke during very hot weather are lack of access to air \nconditioning, advancing age, a number of commonplace chronic medical conditions that interfere \nwith the body's ability to control body temperature (including hyperthyroidism, heart disease, kidney \ndisease, vascular insufficiency and obesity), and use of any of a large number of widely prescribed \nmedications, including most psychiatric medications, anti-hypertensive medications, diuretics, \nantihistamines and heart medications.  Many, perhaps most, Unit 32 prisoners have multiple risk \nfactors and are thus highly vulnerable to heat-related illness. \n11 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 12 of 20\n40.  Although thoroughly aware ofthe risks of excessive temperatures in Unit 32, and ofthe U.S. \nDistrict Court's 2002 finding in Russell v. Johnson that fans, daily showers and ice are essential \nminimal measures to lessen these risks during the hot months, Defendants deliberately ignore these \nfindings and refuse to provide such remedies to any prisoner in Unit 32 - other than those under a \ndeath sentence. Although death row prisoners now have electric fans in their cells pursuant to Court \norder, Defendants have confiscated hundreds of fans from the rest ofUnit 32 and have plastered over \nthe electric outlets in the cells. \nSleep Deprivation \n41.  Unit 32 prisoners are chronically sleep-deprived during the summer by the intense heat and \nhumidity, lack ofventilation, and clouds of mosquitoes and other biting and stinging insects; during \nfreezing weather by lack of warm clothes and bedding; during rains, by rainwater pouring in through \nleaking walls; and at all times by the pandemonium of seriously mentally ill prisoners expressing \ntheir suffering and hallucinations in raving, screaming, moaning and cursing. \n42.  Defendants recently installed bright fluorescent lighting in most Unit 32 cells without also \ninstalling individual light switches in each cell, other than on death row.  Prison staff on each tier \ncentrally control the lighting in individual cells and, not infrequently, leave it on for most or all of \nthe night, contributing further to prisoners' inability to sleep.  Sleep deprivation has been shown to \nresult in cognitive problems, memory deficits, confusion and anxiety, and intensifies psychiatric \nsymptoms. \nAbuse and Ne~:lect of Severely Mentally Ill Prisoners \n43.  Mental illness is widespread in Unit 32. Prisoners who come to Unit 32 in relatively sound \nmental health often develop serious mental illness as a result of the near-total isolation, idleness and \n12 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 13 of 20\nhorrific conditions in the Unit. Those who come to Unit 32 with pre-existing, serious mental illness \nare often reduced to psychosis, mania or compulsive acts of self-abuse.  Many  prisoners on \npractically every tier of the five-building complex exhibit clear signs of advanced and untreated \nmental illness - hallucinating, constantly screaming and cursing, smashing their heads into walls, \nthrowing food and feces, refusing to shower and ignoring basic personal hygiene, and engaging in \ncompulsive flesh-cutting and other acts of self-harm. \n44.  There is no mental health screening process to prevent the transfer of mentally ill prisoners \nto Unit 32.  In fact, Defendants appear to transfer the most severely mentally ill and psychotic \nprisoners to Unit 32 precisely because such prisoners can be most easily warehoused and ignored \nthere. Unit 32 correctional staff are not trained to understand mental illness or identify mental health \ncrises.  It is common for prison staff to taunt, abuse and neglect severely mentally ill prisoners, \nallowing them to go without showers for months at a time, and without food for days at a time. \n45.  Prisoners receive no regular or adequate mental health evaluations once they are in Unit 32. \nWhen an evaluation is performed, it almost always occurs at cell-front and is wholly perfunctory, \nsince the complete lack of privacy prevents prisoners from speaking openly; it is impossible to \nconduct a meaningful psychiatric evaluation in the noise and chaos of the tier. \n46.  Prisoners who are suicidal or at risk of self-harm and urgently need to see a mental health \nprofessional must navigate the same convoluted sick-call process used for medical complaints, in \nwhich requests for help are ignored for weeks. Many suicidal prisoners correctly conclude that their \nbest chance of getting help is to prove they are a self-risk by hurting themselves. \n47.  Mentally ill prisoners who attempt to hurt themselves may be temporarily admitted to the \nUnit 42 infirmary for \"observation.\"  At times, Defendants have imposed a standing order that \n13 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 14 of 20\nprisoners admitted to the infirmary for suicidal impulses are to receive \"no privileges\" - meaning \nno clothes, hospital gown, mattress, bedding, soap or toilet paper. Many mentally ill prisoners have \nbeen held naked for days in a filthy bare cell in the psychiatric wing of the Unit 42 infirmary under \nthe \"no privileges\" order. Psychiatric patients in the infirmary are monitored by video and not seen \nregularly by doctors or nurses. There are no activities, outdoor exercise or opportunities for human \ncontact; the day room on the psychiatric wing is rarely used. \n48.  Prisoners with untreated mental health problems who compulsively hurt themselves or act \nout in other ways often wind up in the holding tank near the Unit 32 clinic, where they are stripped \nnaked and left for an entire shift, or in \"management isolation units\" or \"punishment cells\" on the \ncell-block, where they may be left naked without medical or psychiatric intervention for days. \nAssignment to punishment cells, management isolation units, or the \"special needs\" tier is subject \nto no written guidelines or time limits and is largely punitive, designed for prisoners who have been \nidentified as troublemakers. Many ofthese prisoners suffer from serious mental illness that has been \nexacerbated by the lack of adequate mental health care and the harsh conditions in Unit 32. \n49.  In the past, \"punishment cells\"-cells outfitted with solid doors rather than open-bar fronts \n-were scattered throughout Unit 32, at the front of each tier. Now Defendants are converting entire \ntiers and zones into isolation units, retrofitting every cell with a plexiglass or steel door that makes \nit impossible for the cell inhabitant to summon help or communicate with anyone. \n50.  As the Defendants are aware from the expert testimony at the Russell trial, solid cell-fronts \ncreate an intolerably high risk of lethal heat-stroke during the hot weather months, a risk that is \nparticularly acute for prisoners who suffer from mental illness. Defendants have chosen to begin the \nprocess of installing solid doors in an area where they house the most vulnerable prisoners - the \n14 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 15 of 20\n\"special needs psychiatric tier\" in Delta Building. \n51.  Defendants created the special needs psychiatric tier following the U.S. District Court's \n2003 order enjoining them from housing severely mentally ill prisoners on death row. Residents of \nthe special needs tier do not, however, receive more frequent or meaningful attention from mental \nhealth staff; Defendants simply use this tier as a dumping ground for prisoners with mental illness, \nand to punish prisoners seen as  \"management problems\" by housing them in close proximity to \nfloridly psychotic prisoners. \n52.  For months, Defendants left a disturbed, deaf-mute prisoner in his cell on the special needs \ntier, without a mental health evaluation or any attempt to communicate with him.  His cell became \nfilthy and he was allowed to remain unwashed for weeks.  Correctional staff threw things at him to \nget his attention, and when he threw things back, he was cited for rule violations. \n53.  In addition to the special needs tier, Defendants recently created at least one so-called \n\"management isolation unit\" in Alpha Building. All the cells in the management isolation unit have \nmodified plexiglass cell-fronts. Like many prisoners in Unit 32, prisoners in management isolation \nsuffer from serious medical or mental health problems-such as severe asthma, seizure disorders and \nsuicidal ideation - that make it essential for them to be able to summon help quickly.  Because of \nthe solid cell-fronts and severe understaffing, however, such prisoners must yell, bang on walls and \nset fires to get the officers' attention.  Cell fires, which are common throughout Unit 32, are a daily \nroutine in the management isolation tier.  The fires sometimes bum for ten minutes before officers \nrespond.  Thick smoke and extinguisher fumes travel the length ofthe tier and seep into the cells. \nInadequate Access to Medical, Mental Health and Dental Care \n54.  In April2003, the State ofMississippi engaged Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (CMS), \n15 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 16 of 20\na private for-profit health care services company, to provide medical, dental and mental health care \nto prisoners incarcerated at Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP) and other MDOC facilities. Under \nthe terms of its contract with CMS, and consistent with its obligations under state and federal law, \nMDOC remains responsible for the care and security of the prisoners in its custody and has the \ncontractual right to review and approve CMS policies and procedures, monitor CMS' performance, \nand approve key CMS personnel. \n55.  The CMS and MDOC Defendants provide Unit 32 prisoners with grossly inadequate access \nto health care.  Medical staff routinely ignore requests for urgent care by prisoners with dangerous \nand painful medical, dental and mental health problems. Prisoners often must submit multiple sick \ncall requests, over the course of several weeks, or badger correctional officers before they are able \nto see a doctor or nurse.  Many prisoners who have been requesting medical attention for weeks \nwind up being taken away from Unit 32 by ambulance, after their condition has become so urgent \nand life-threatening that it can no longer be ignored by prison staff. \n56.  Defendants' medical staff fail to identifymanyprisoners with serious and chronic conditions; \nthese prisoners do not get essential monitoring and ongoing care.  The treatment that CMS and \nMDOC provide for chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, falls far \nbelow well-established standards of care that are widely accepted by the  medical community. \n57.  CMS and MDOC medical staff fail to monitor prisoners with complex medical problems. \nErratic prescription drug delivery and other lapses in treatment are routine. Medical staff often deny \npatients accurate information about their own serious medical conditions and the results of medical \ntests, even when the results are abnormal, and do not explain to prisoners how to manage their \nillnesses. \n16 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 17 of 20\n58.  Even for well-documented chronic illnesses, Defendants' medical staff force prisoners to \nplead for follow-up treatment and medication refills.  Every time the patient does seek essential \ntreatment or follow-up care for an acute or chronic illness, Defendants charge him a six -dollar co-pay \n- an exorbitant charge by prison standards that is clearly intended to (and does) discourage patients \nfrom seeking necessary care. \n59.  Bad medical record-keeping makes it essentially impossible for Defendants CMS and \nMDOC to deliver adequate health care to prisoners.  Medical records are so disorganized and so \npoorly maintained that doctors, nurses and support staff simply cannot make appropriate and timely \ntreatment decisions, monitor care of chronically or acutely ill patients, or determine whether \nprescriptions have been timely delivered or reordered. \n60.  Defendants' system for refilling prescriptions in Unit 32 is so defective that significant and \nunnecessary disruptions in medication delivery are routine. For example, Unit 32 prisoners who are \nHIV -positive are repeatedly denied their HIV medications, sometimes for days at a time, although, \nas Defendants are well aware, continuity in taking prescribed HIV medication is essential in \npreventing viral resistance, and a lapse of even a few days can have extremely serious health \nconsequences.  Even for medications that are administered by nurses on a daily basis, such as most \npsychiatric drugs, entirely unnecessary disruptions in medication are common. Nurses often inform \nprisoners only a day or two in advance that their medication is about to run out, and then leave it to \nthe prisoner to put in a request to see a doctor in order to authorize the refill.  A two- to three-week \nmedication gap almost always ensues. \n61.  In an effort to trim costs, Defendants CMS and MDOC actively discourage physicians at \nMSP from referring prisoners for off-site medical consultation, even when their medical conditions \n17 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 18 of 20\nare serious and life-threatening.  Thus, critically ill prisoners who need to be seen by off-site \nspecialists - such as cardiologists, surgeons and oncologists - are not referred; instead, these \nprisoners are admitted to the MSP infirmary at Unit 42, which has neither the staff nor the equipment \nto diagnose and treat critically ill prisoners.  Defendants' failure to properly diagnose and treat \ncritically ill prisoners through prompt referral to off-site specialists results in pain, suffering and \nincreased medical complications for many prisoners, and premature death for some. \n62.  On information and belief, CMS and MDOC Defendants sometimes arrange for the transfer \nof seriously ill prisoners to private prison facilities in Mississippi, to hide evidence of Defendants' \nown inadequate medical care and to save the imminent cost of caring for such prisoners, whose \nhealth has worsened due to the lack of proper treatment.  For example, prisoner Antonio Franklin \ncame to Unit 32 in 2003 with congenital heart disease and a history ofthree open heart surgeries and \na porcine valve replacement.  Defendants were aware of his tenuous medical condition at the time \nof his intake. Franklin's heart function needs to be monitored closely and his medications adjusted \nregularly, because he is always at risk of aortic rupture and sudden death.  By September 2004, \nFranklin was experiencing regular chest pain. On September 15, 2004, a CMS physician examined \nFranklin and noted that he needed an immediate off-site evaluation by a cardiologist by the end of \nthe month. On December 1, Plaintiffs' counsel notified MDOC and CMS that Franklin still had not \nbeen seen by a cardiac specialist and his situation was urgent.  Despite these warnings, the off-site \nevaluation was not performed until February 11, 2005. By late February, the results oft he evaluation \nwere still not found in Franklin's extremely disorganized medical chart, and there was a progress \nnote from a staff physician indicating that he or she did not know why Franklin was even being \nfollowed.  On information and belief, after many months of neglect and substandard medical care, \n18 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 19 of 20\nDefendants transferred Franklin to a private prison in April2005. \n63.  Defendants knowingly retain unqualified and incompetent doctors to provide medical and \nmental health care to Unit 32 prisoners.  Two physicians at MSP are not approved to practice \nanywhere in Mississippi (or any state) except at Parchman.  These doctors, who have never passed \ntheir medical boards, have a special license that allows them to work only at MSP under the \n\"favorable recommendation\" ofthe medical director. This special exemption-a limited institutional \nlicensure-appears to have been created at the behest ofMDOC to cover these particular longtime \nemployees, at least one of whom Defendants know to be dangerously incompetent. The Mississippi \nState Board ofMedical Licensure has disciplined and had previously restricted the medical licenses \nof three other physicians at MSP, including the CMS-Parchman Medical Director (due to habitual \ndrug use),  the Chief Psychiatrist (due to  a history of patient sexual exploitation and sexual \nharassment),  and  a contract physician (due to medicare fraud  involving the performance of \nunnecessary cardiac stent procedures and controlled substance abuse). \nArbitrary Placement and Indefinite Detention in Unit 32 \n64.  The totality of conditions described above - profound isolation, complete physical and \nmental idleness, dangerously flawed security, the routine use of excessive force, extreme filth and \nlack of sanitation, malfunctioning toilets that cough up human excrement, constant exposure to \ninsects and vermin, unbearable heat, grossly inadequate medical and mental health care, and the \nhellish proximity ofc onstantly screaming and hallucinating prisoners whose madness goes untreated \n- in combination make Unit 32 the worst place to be incarcerated in Mississippi, perhaps in the \nnation. Compounding these horrors, the great majority ofthe ~en in Unit 32 remain there for years; \nsome have been there for decades.  Virtually all assignments to Unit 32 are for an indefinite period \n19 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-1     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 20 of 20\n- meaning no one knows when, or if, he is getting out. \n65.  Prisoners generally receive no advance notice or explanation before they are transferred to \nUnit 32, and it may be months before they a receive a classification hearing after arriving on the \nUnit.  Many have been confined in Unit 32 for months or years without any clear understanding of \nwhy they were placed there. When classification reviews do occur, prisoners rarely receive advance \nnotice - written or otherwise - of the hearing, much less of the evidence against them. The final \ndecisionmak:er is not required to provide any reasons or factual basis for his or her decision, and no \nguidance is ever given as to what conduct is necessary to get out of Unit 32.  Prisoners who remain \nfree of significant rule violations for years are still not released from Unit 32. Prisoners whose case \nmanagers recommend they be upgraded and released find that those recommendations are overridden \nby higher-level prison officials, for reasons that are neither shared with the prisoner nor recorded. \nOn information and belief, confinement in Unit 32 has the effect of denying otherwise eligible \nprisoners parole consideration and other types of earned time or early release. \n66.  The MDOC classification system-touted as an \"objective\" point system but impenetrable \nto most prisoners-gives essentially unlimited discretion to MDOC officials in determining custody \nlevels and confinement status.  Although Unit 32, like any supermax facility, was designed and \nintended to house the most dangerous offenders, MDOC places prisoners in Unit 32 for a variety of \nreasons, most of which have nothing to do with legitimate security concerns. Many prisoners wind \nup in Unit 32 solely because they have special dietary or medical needs, because they are partially \ndisabled, because they have requested or need protective custody, because they are HIV positive, or \nbecause they need (but do not get) significant mental health care.  Many other prisoners are placed \nor remain indefinitely in Unit 32 for purely arbitrary reasons, or due to classification errors, or \n20 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 1 of 9\nbecause they cannot convince their unit case manager to schedule a reclassification hearing. \n67.  Prisoners may be assigned indefinitely to administrative segregation, and thus to Unit 32, \nbecause they are designated Security Threat Group (STG), for alleged gang membership; or High \nSecurity Risk (HSR), for being a presumed escape risk; or Management Isolation, because they are \ndeemed to be a physical threat to staff and other prisoners. On information and belief, many ofthese \nassignments are factually erroneous or entirely unnecessary.  For example, an elderly prisoner who \ncould scarcely walk unassisted was kept on HSR status for years until his death due to an escape \nattempt many years before.  There are virtually no written guidelines to govern these segregation \ncategories; prisoners so designated are simply transferred to Unit 32, or to punishment cells within \nUnit 32, and are held for many months without any classification review whatsoever, or for many \nyears without any meaningful opportunity to dispute their custody or segregation status. \n68.  Because ofthe often arbitrary, baseless, punitive and unreviewable nature of assignment to \nUnit 32, virtually every prisoner there despairs of ever getting out of lockdown.  This total absence \nof hope, as much as any other condition of confinement, inflicts pain and suffering, and contributes \nto the mental and physical deterioration of the men in Unit 32. \nNamed Plaintiffs \n69.  Jeffery Presley is 24 years old and has been housed in Unit 32 since 2003.  Mr. Presley \ncontracted a serious staph infection (MRSA) on his left knee on or about July 19,2004. By July21, \n2004 his knee was swollen, red, itching and painful.  A doctor at the Unit 32 clinic initially \nmisdiagnosed Mr. Presley's condition as resulting from a brown recluse spider bite. Mr. Presley was \ngiven only topical antibiotic cream and five band-aids.  Mr. Presley pleaded with correctional \nofficers and hospital staff for additional medical treatment over the next four days, as his knee grew \n21 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 2 of 9\nprogressively worse, until it was grotesquely swollen and leaking blood.  On July 25, 2005, after \nbeing held all night in the Unit 32 holding tank without medical attention, Mr. Presley was taken to \nthe Unit 42 infirmary, where a doctor cut out a section of his leg and packed it with medicated string. \nHe was sent back to Unit 32 with Tylenol. For days afterward, Mr. Presley was forced to hop up and \ndown several flights of stairs at Unit 32, in order to have his dressing changed daily.  His request to \nbe moved to a downstairs cell was denied.  In January 2005, Mr. Presley satisfied the requirements \nto be taken offHSR status, upgraded to B-custody, and moved out ofUnit 32.  MDOC Defendants \nhave denied him reclassification and transfer. He has not been provided with a written explanation \nfor this decision. \n70.  Dennis Brumfield is 40 years old and has been housed in Unit 32 since 1997. In 2003, Mr. \nBrumfield was one of a number of non-death row prisoners who filed grievances complaining about \nthe totality of conditions in Unit 32, many of which were then being challenged on behalf of death \nrow prisoners in Russell v. Johnson.  Mr. Brumfield has been subjected to, and complained about, \nconditions including grossly inadequate sanitation, excessive heat and cold, lack of exercise, vermin \ninfestation, defective plumbing, ceiling leaks, inadequate treatment and housing of mentally ill \nprisoners, enforced isolation and idleness, harassment and excessive force by correctional officers, \nand ongoing sleep deprivation due to environmental conditions in the Unit. \n71.  Steven Farris is 23 years old and has been housed at Unit 32 since he was transferred there \nin 2001, at the age of 19, for allegedly plotting an escape.  Mr. Farris had no opportunity to defend \nhimself against the escape charge for almost two years and never saw the evidence against him.  In \n2003, Mr. Farris was one of a number ofn on-death row prisoners who filed grievances complaining \nabout the totality of conditions in Unit 32, many of which were then being challenged on behalf of \n22 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 3 of 9\ndeath row prisoners in Russell v. Johnson.  Mr. Farris has been subjected to, and complained about, \ngrossly inadequate sanitation, excessive heat and cold, lack of exercise, vermin infestation, defective \nplumbing, ceiling leaks, inadequate treatment and housing of mentally ill prisoners, enforced \nisolation and idleness, harassment and excessive force by correctional officers, and ongoing sleep \ndeprivation due to environmental conditions in the Unit. \n72.  Marcus D. Williams is 29 years old and has been housed in Unit 32 since 2003.  Mr. \nWilliams suffers from seizure disorder, hypertension and has a history of self-harm incidents and \nserious mental illness.  During his time at Unit 32, he has received grossly inadequate medical and \nmental health care and has been subjected to egregiously punitive confinement in punishment cells, \non the special needs psychiatric tier, and in the management isolation unit. Mr. Williams is currently \nbeing housed on the special needs tier, in a cell with a newly installed solid steel door, where he is \nkept without human contact for 23 or 24 hours a day.  The lights in his cell are kept on 24-hours a \nday.  The cell is virtually sound-proof and there is no intercom, so Mr. Williams is unable to \nsummon help or medical attention if he needs it.  Previously, Mr. Williams was housed behind a \nsolid plexiglass door in the management isolation unit, where he resorted to setting fires after he was \ndenied seizure medication three days in a row because the nurses kept showing up without a refill \nand confusing his chart with that of another prisoner. \nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies \n73.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available to them on the matters alleged \nabove by timely submitting all necessary grievance letters and appeal forms. \n74.  Jeffery Presley submitted a request for an administrative remedy on or about July 25, 2004, \ncomplaining ofi nadequate medical care, unsanitary food service and environmental conditions, leaky \n23 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 4 of 9\nceilings, defective plumbing, and regular harassment by correctional officers. Mr. Presley received \na certificate of exhaustion dated November 15, 2004, stating that he has fulfilled the requirements \nof the Administrative Remedy Program (ARP).  Mr. Presley also submitted a request for an \nadministrative remedy on or about November 17,2004, complaining that he should be reclassified \nand transferred to general population.  He received a certificate of exhaustion dated January 17, \n2005. \n75.  Dennis Brumfield requested an administrative remedy for inadequate living conditions in \nUnit 32 on or about November 3, 2003.  Mr. Brumfield specifically complained of the totality of \nconditions being litigated in Russell v. Johnson, on behalf of death row prisoners.  He received a \ncertificate of exhaustion dated January 15, 2004. \n76.  Steven Farris submitted a request for an administrative remedy on September 2, 2003 \ncomplaining of grossly inadequate conditions of confinement and inadequate due process in \nconnection with periodic classification reviews. The Legal Claims Adjudicator rejected Mr. Farris' \nARP request, indicating that a remedy had been requested for more than one incident.  Mr. Farris \nsubsequently wrote to the MSP Superintendent and twice to the MDOC Commissioner disputing \nthis determination and arguing that it was unreasonable to require him to file separate ARP requests \non the many deficient conditions in Unit 32, most of which were then being litigated in Russell v. \nJohnson, and that doing so would take him several years to exhaust his administrative remedies. The \nSuperintendent and Commissioner responded to Mr. Farris' requests to intervene and reconsider his \ngrievance on October 3, 2003 and February 10, 2004, respectively, declining to intervene. Mr. Farris \nhas exhausted the administrative remedies reasonably available to him. \n77.  Marcus D. Williams filed an emergency grievance on March 2, 2005, requesting immediate \n24 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 5 of 9\nrelief from the dangerous conditions to which he was being subjected in the Unit 32 management \nisolation unit, including total isolation, lack ofv entilation, and inadequate medical and mental health \ncare, as well as  the lack of due process in connection with his placement in administrative \nsegregation.  The Legal Claims Adjudicator declined to grant emergency relief and accepted Mr. \nWilliams' emergency grievance as a regular request for an administrative remedy.  On information \nand belief, Mr. Williams has timely filed all necessary appeals ofthis ARP request; or, if he failed \nto do so, he was impeded by the egregiously punitive and restrictive conditions in which he has been \nhoused for the last several months, in total isolation behind a solid steel cell-front, and by his mental \nillness  and physical  infirmities,  which  are  not  being properly treated  or accommodated by \nDefendants. Under MDOC grievance procedures, which requires that the ARP process be completed \nwithin 90 days, Mr. Williams exhausted his administrative remedies on or about June 2, 2005. \n78.  On March 4, 2005, an emergency grievance was also filed by Plaintiffs' counsel on behalf \nofMr. Williams, and two other prisoners in the management isolation unit, Terry Beasley and Marco \nDeshaw Williamson. Despite the urgent and life-threatening conditions detailed in the emergency \ngrievance, the Legal Claims Adjudicator declined to address the matter under emergency review \nprocedures and suggested that the grievance should be resubmitted as a regular grievance by the \nprisoners. Plaintiffs' counsel appealed this decision to the Commissioner, who concurred, on April \n7, 2005, that the totality of conditions to which Mr. Williams and other prisoners were being \nsubjected were not an emergency. Under MDOC grievance procedures, which require that the ARP \nprocess be completed within 90 days, this emergency request for an administrative remedy was \nexhausted on or about June 4, 2005.  When Terry Beasley attempted to submit a regular grievance \nabout the horrific conditions in the management isolation unit, as suggested by the Legal Claims \n25 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 6 of 9\nAdjudicator, a prison official rejected his ARP and told him that the ACLU had already filed a \ngrievance on his behalf. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n79.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf ofthemselves and all others similarly situated, pursuant \nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2). \n80.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all prisoners who are now, or will in the \nfuture be, confined in Unit 32 of Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi. \n81.  There are currently approximately 1000 prisoners confined at Unit 32.  The members ofthe \nclass are too numerous, and the membership of the class too fluid, to permit joinder of all members. \nAll class members are equally subject to the unconstitutional and unlawful conditions described in \nthis Complaint, and common questions oflaw and fact exist as to all class members. These common \nquestions include, but are not limited to, whether conditions of confinement for Unit 32 prisoners \nat Parchman violate their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution; whether the systemically inadequate medical, mental health and dental care provided \nto Unit 32 prisoners violates their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution; and whether the procedures by which MDOC Defendants place and retain \nprisoners in Unit 32 fail to satisfy procedural due process, in violation of their rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Defendants have acted and refused to act \non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive and \ndeclaratory reliefwith respect to the class as a whole. \n82.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of those of the class. They do not have access \n26 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 7 of 9\nto minimally adequate medical and mental health care, and are exposed to the dangerous and \ninhumane conditions in Unit 32.  They have not received procedural due process in their placement \nand continued confinement in Unit 32. \n83.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.  The interests of \nPlaintiffs are consistent with those of the class, and they are represented by counsel who are \nexperienced in class action, civil rights; and prison conditions litigation. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim-Eighth Amendment \nBy consciously subjecting Plaintiffs to the grossly inhumane and dangerous conditions of \nconfinement and to the extreme deprivations ofbasic medical and psychiatric care described herein, \nDefendants have acted, and continue to act, with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' serious health \nand safety needs, and have violated their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution. \nSecond Claim-Denial of Procedural Due Process \nBy placing and retaining Plaintiffs in Unit 32, where the conditions of confinement impose \non Plaintiffs atypical and significant hardships in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, \nwithout affording Plaintiffs minimal notice, opportunity to be heard, and other basic procedural \nsafeguards, Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, Plaintiffs due process, in violation oftheir \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n1.  Issue a judgment declaring that the actions of Defendants described herein are \n27 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 1-2     Filed 06/22/2005     Page 8 of 9\nunlawful and violate Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States; \n2.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  Defendants,  their  subordinates,  agents, \nemployees, and all others acting in concert with them, from subjecting Plaintiffs to the conditions \nset forth in this Complaint; \n3.  Grant Plaintiffs theirreasonable attorney fees and costs pursuantto 42 U.S. C. § 1988 \nand other applicable law; and \n4.  Grant such other relief as the Court considers just and proper. \nDate:  June 21, 2005 \nBY: \nMS Bar No. 2532 \n767 N. Congress Street \nJackson, MS 39202 \nTel.

The parties have \nnot  reached  an  accord  on whether Defendants  will  facilitate  access  by  Plaintiffs’ \nlawyers  and  experts  to  these  facilities  for  purposes  of  monitoring;  Plaintiffs’ \nmotion to  compel  Defendants  to  facilitate  such  access  is  pending before the  Court. \n3..

Force \nlikely  to  cause  serious  bodily  injury  may  never  be  used  except  to  prevent  escape \nor  an  immediate  threat  of  serious  physical  injury to  another  person  and  when  a \nlesser use  of force  would  not eliminate  that threat.  . \n   \nCaseditsew0Oh48H4DD  DieurmentG8ce   FilesittiBRo0g7  Pages  6fdi2i j \n9.  Defendants  agree that  audio-visual  recording  of  all  use  of  force  incidents \nin  Unit  32,  of  adequate  quality  to  allow  review  of the  incident,  must  be  the  norm, \nand  that  only  in  the  most  exceptional  circumstances  should  it  be  impracticable  to \nmake  such  recordings.  To accomplish this  goal,  Defendants  will  add  at  least  41 \nsecurity  cameras  to  Unit  32  for  a  total of  341,  and will  develop  protocols  and \nprocedures  to  ensure  that  adequate  audio-videotaping  of use  of force  in  Unit  32  is. \nthe  norm  through  the  identification  of  improvements  in  equipment,  equipment  — \nplacement,  record  keeping,  staff  training,  and  regulations.

Whenever  possible,  the  Shift  Commander  or \nWarden  will  visit  the  prisoner  before  consenting  to  the  use  of force,  to  determine \nif  force  is  necessary.  Likewise,  except  in  emergency  circumstances,  a  mental \nhealth  professional  will  be  consulted  or  summoned  before  force  is  used, to  try  to \nmake  the  use  of force  unnecessary.  A  log  will  be  maintained recording  the  efforts \nmade  to  obtain  the  presence  of  the  Shift  Commander  or  Warden  and  a  mental \nhealth professional  prior to  the use  of force. \n11.  Defendants  will  develop  protocols  and  procedures  in  consultation  with  _ \nPlaintiffs’  mental  health  monitor  to  ensure  the  involvement  of  a  mental  health \n  \n \nCase diQdscov0Oi48alANn  DogumentGes2  Filed 11/184200%7  Page6  efh21 \nprofessional  prior  to  use  of force  on  prisoners  with  Severe  Mental  II]ness  at  Unit \n32. \n12.

Any  contaminated  cell  will  be \ndecontaminated  before  a  prisoner  is  returned  to  it.  If  emergency  circumstances \ncreating  an  imminent  threat  to  security  prevent  staff  from  immediately  removing \nprisoners  from  contaminated  areas, Defendants  will  at  the  very  least  promptly \nprovide  the  prisoners  who  have  been  exposed  to  the  chemical  agents  with  an \nadequate  supply  of appropriate  decontaminating  agents. \nCLASSIFICATION \n|  13,  Prisoners  may  be  held  in  long-term administrative  segregation  only  when \n(A)  they  have  behaved  violently  and  aggressively  while  incarcerated,  (B)  they  are \nactively  involved  in  disruptive  gang  activity,  (C)  they  have  escaped  or  attempted \nto  escape  from  within  a  security  perimeter  and/or  custody  or  direct  supervision, \n(D)  they  have  committed  a  felony  while  on  escape from  a community  correctional \nfacility,  or  (E)  the  Commissioner  or  his  designee  determines,  based  on  specific \nobjective  criteria  set  forth  in  writing,  that  there  is  a  significant  risk  that  the \nprisoner  will  cause  physical  injury  to  prison  staff,  other  prisoners,  or  members  of\nCase HOtey00l48eJADD  DoeumentG8s2  Filed tiBe00T7  Paeed  ofot2i1  \nthe  public  if  he  is  housed  in  general  population,  even  at  the  highest  security \nlevel..  “Long  term”  administrative  segregation  means  longer than  sixty  days. \n14.

The  relief  set  forth  in  this  Supplemental  Consent  Decree  is  narrowly \ndrawn,  extends  no  further than  necessary  to  prevent irreparable  harm  to  Plaintiffs, \nand  is  the  least  intrusive  means  necessary  to  prevent  an  unreasonable  risk  of harm. \nto  the  health  and  safety  of  the  Plaintiffs.  The  Court further  finds,  based  on  the \nevidence  regarding  current  conditions  at  Unit  32,  that  the  relief  set  forth  above is \notherwise  appropriate pursuant  to  the  standard  set forth  in  18  USC  §  3626(a). \n28.  The  Parties  agree  that the  terms  of this  Supplemental  Consent  Decree  shall \nbe  submitted  to  the  Court  for  approval  and  that  the  Court  shall  retain jurisdiction \nto  enforce  the  terms  thereof. \nSO  ORDERED,  this  15  h  of:  i  AW  2007. \n|  , \nUNITEPJSTATES  MAGISTRATE  JUDGE | \n     \nil\n",

CIVIL ACTION NO.  4:05CV148-JAD \n \nCHRISTOPHER EPPS, ET AL.                                                DEFENDANTS \n                 \n                 \nSUPPLEMENTAL CONSENT DECREE \nON MENTAL HEALTH CARE, \nUSE OF FORCE AND CLASSIFICATION \n \n \nThe parties enter into this Supplemental Consent Decree on Mental Health \nCare, Use of Force, and Classification in order to supplement the Consent Decree \npreviously  entered  April  28,  2006  and  the  Supplemental  Consent  Decree  on \nMedical Care entered April 16, 2007.      \n \nMENTAL HEALTH \n1.         After December 1, 2007, Unit 32 will not be used for long-term housing of \nprisoners  with  Severe  Mental  Illness,  other  than  those  on  Death  Row.    For \npurposes of this Order “long term” means more than 14 days.  “Prisoners with \nSevere Mental Illness” means those with an Axis I diagnosis of a major mental \nillness (for example Schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder), Bipolar Disorder, \nDepressive  Disorder  or  other  serious  Mood  Disorder;  prisoners  who  are \nsignificantly disabled by mental retardation or an organic brain disorder; and \nprisoners  who  are  significantly  disabled  by  any  other  mental  disorder  (for \n  1 \n\nexample, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder or any \ndisorder characterized by repetitive self-harm. \n \n2.         Prisoners in Unit 32 with Severe Mental Illness requiring inpatient level of \ncare will be housed at East Mississippi Correctional Facility or in another facility \nwhere they can receive the full range of appropriate treatment programs and the \nlevel of care consist with their individualized treatment plans.    The parties have \nnot reached an accord on whether Defendants will facilitate access by Plaintiffs’ \nlawyers  and  experts  to  these  facilities  for  purposes  of  monitoring;  Plaintiffs’ \nmotion to compel Defendants to facilitate such access is pending before the Court.   \n \n3.    Defendants will designate a space at Unit 32 exclusively for use as a Mental \nHealth Step-Down Unit.     The Mental Health Step-Down Unit will be used to \nhouse mentally ill prisoners who require an intermediate level of psychiatric care \n(intermediate between inpatient and outpatient treatment, roughly equivalent to \nresidential  treatment  and  partial  hospitalization  in  the  community).  These \nprisoners  will  be  involved  in  mental  health  treatment  and  will  not  be  in \nadministrative  segregation  status.  The  care  provided  will  include  an \nindividualized multidisciplinary treatment plan, based on an assessment of the \npatient’s needs, and a statement of short- and long-term goals and the methods by \nwhich these goals will be pursued. When clinically indicated, and in light of \nconsultation between mental health and security staff, the treatment plan will give \npatients access to the range of treatment, supportive and rehabilitative services \n  2 \n\n(such as individual and group counseling, a range of psychiatric rehabilitation \nprograms and self-help groups) that mental health specialists deem appropriate.  \nThe step-down unit will be staffed by at least one full-time psychologist and such \nother mental health treatment and nursing personnel as are needed.  After one year \nof operation the mental health step-down program at Unit 32 will be re-evaluated \nfor staff and/or location changes.  \n \n4.        Prisoners in suicidal or other psychiatric crisis will be housed and provided \nappropriate observation and treatment at Unit 32 in a crisis stabilization area \ninside  the  Step-Down  Unit.  Twenty-four-hour  nursing  coverage  (which  may \ninclude coverage by the nursing staff at Unit 42) will be available to prisoners in \nthe crisis stabilization area.  The prisoners in this area will have out-of-cell time \nand will participate in individual and group treatment consistent with orders from \nthe supervising psychiatrist. Prisoners will spend no more than fourteen days in \nthe crisis stabilization area, after which they will either be released back to their \ncells,  or  to  the  Mental  Health  Step-Down  Unit,  or  sent  to  East  Mississippi \nCorrectional Facility, or other housing appropriate for their condition.    \n \n5.         Defendants will ensure that security staff persons successfully complete a \n40-hour training course for working with mentally ill prisoners prior to working in \nthe Mental Health Step-Down Unit.   Only those officers successfully trained will \nbe assigned work in the Mental Health Step-Down Unit. \n \n  3 \n\n6.         Defendants will retain or cause to be retained at least five full-time mental \nhealth professionals, with at least masters’ degrees in mental health, to provide \nservices to the prisoners housed in Unit 32.  Defendants will ensure that at least \nthree such mental health professionals are in place by the time the Court enters \nthis Order; that at least four are in place by January 1, 2008; and that at least five \nare in place by March 1, 2008. At least one of these full-time mental health \nprofessionals shall be a licensed therapeutic mental health clinician, trained in \ncrisis intervention work, with at least a Masters degree.  \n \n7.         No later than December 1, 2007, Defendants will ensure that there are \nleast two full-time psychiatrists on site at MSP dedicated exclusively to providing \nmental health services to prisoners at MSP.        \n \nUSE OF FORCE \n8.  Physical force (including chemical sprays) will not be used against any \nprisoner unless his actions are creating an immediate threat of serious self-injury, \nor of physical injury to another person, or of property damage causing a threat to \nsecurity, and not unless reasonable efforts to use verbal persuasion and other non-\nphysical methods of gaining control have been attempted and have failed. Force \nlikely to cause serious bodily injury may never be used except to prevent escape \nor an immediate threat of serious physical injury to another person and when a \nlesser use of force would not eliminate that threat. \n \n  4 \n\n9.         Defendants agree that audio-visual recording of all use of force incidents \nin Unit 32, of adequate quality to allow review of the incident, must be the norm, \nand that only in the most exceptional circumstances should it be impracticable to \nmake such recordings.  To accomplish this goal, Defendants will add at least 41 \nsecurity cameras to Unit 32 for a total of 341, and will develop protocols and \nprocedures to ensure that adequate audio-videotaping of use of force in Unit 32 is \nthe norm through the identification of improvements in equipment, equipment \nplacement,  record  keeping,  staff  training,  and  regulations.   They  will  also \nimplement procedures for generating monthly reports on use of force in Unit 32.  \n \n10.       Except in emergency circumstances where no delay is possible because of \nthe  risk  of  serious  bodily  injury  or  damage  to  property  creating  a  threat  to \nsecurity, the Shift Commander or Warden will be notified and his or her consent \nobtained  before  force  is  used.  Whenever  possible,  the  Shift  Commander  or \nWarden will visit the prisoner before consenting to the use of force, to determine \nif force is necessary.  Likewise, except in emergency circumstances, a mental \nhealth professional will be consulted or summoned before force is used, to try to \nmake the use of force unnecessary.  A log will be maintained recording the efforts \nmade to obtain the presence of the Shift Commander or Warden and a mental \nhealth professional prior to the use of force.   \n \n11.       Defendants will develop protocols and procedures in consultation with \nPlaintiffs’ mental health monitor to ensure the involvement of a mental health \n  5 \n\nprofessional prior to use of force on prisoners with Severe Mental Illness at Unit \n32. \n \n12.        All  Unit  32  prisoners  who  have  been  exposed  to  OC  spray  or  other \nchemical agents will be immediately removed from the contaminated area, will \npromptly be permitted to shower,  and will be examined by medical staff cell-side \nto  see  if  transport  to  the  clinic  is  needed.     Any  contaminated  cell  will  be \ndecontaminated before a prisoner is returned to it.  If emergency circumstances \ncreating an imminent threat to security prevent staff from immediately removing \nprisoners from contaminated areas, Defendants will at the very least promptly \nprovide the prisoners who have been exposed to the chemical agents with an \nadequate supply of appropriate decontaminating agents.   \n \nCLASSIFICATION \n13.       Prisoners may be held in long-term administrative segregation only when  \n(A) they have behaved violently and aggressively while incarcerated, (B) they are \nactively involved in disruptive gang activity, (C) they have escaped or attempted \nto escape from within a security perimeter and/or custody or direct supervision, \n(D) they have committed a felony while on escape from a community correctional \nfacility, or  (E) the Commissioner or his designee determines, based on specific \nobjective  criteria  set  forth  in  writing,  that  there  is  a  significant  risk  that  the \nprisoner will cause physical injury to prison staff, other prisoners, or members of \n  6 \n\nthe public if he is housed in general population, even at the highest security \nlevel..  “Long term” administrative segregation means longer than sixty days.   \n \n14.       Prisoners will not be housed in administrative segregation based solely on \ntheir classification scores or for refusing to work or program. \n \n15.      Prisoners will not be housed in administrative segregation solely because \nthey escaped from a youth facility or community correctional facility.    \n \n16.   Prisoners will not be housed in administrative segregation solely because \nthey are subject to a felony detainer, even if for a serious crime, from another \njurisdiction.  \n \n17.   Prisoners will not be housed in administrative segregation solely because \nthey were convicted of a serious crime and have tested positive for marijuana.    \n \n18.       Prisoners will not be housed in administrative segregation solely because \nthey need protective custody.  Prisoners needing protection will be housed and \naccorded  access  to  visits,  canteen,  and  other  privileges  consistent  with  their \ncustody levels.   \n \n19.       Prisoners with Severe Mental Illness will not be housed in administrative \nsegregation at Unit 32 for longer than fourteen days.   \n  7 \n\n \n20.       Prisoners who are not high-level gang members will not be placed in long-\nterm administrative segregation solely because they are affiliated with a gang.   \n Prisoners will be placed in long-term administrative segregation based on gang \naffiliation  only  if  they  are  confirmed  leaders,  enforcers  or  disruptive  core \nmembers of gangs designated by MDOC as security threat groups.  Defendants \nwill provide prisoners with a means for renouncing affiliation with a security \nthreat group that does not require prisoners to provide identities of gang members \nas a condition for renunciation.   \n \n21.       The process for admission to and release from administrative segregation \nwill be centralized.  A Warden who wishes to recommend that an inmate be \nhoused in administrative segregation must submit to the Central Classification \nOffice for review a referral form documenting the reason for the referral. If the \nCentral Classification Office agrees with the recommendation, it will forward the \nreferral  form  to the  Commissioner  or  his  designee  for  final  review  and \napproval.  Emergency admissions will be permitted but the referral form must be \nsubmitted at the time of admission and the review process must be completed \nwithin seven calendar days of the emergency admission. \n \n22.     Prisoners in administrative segregation who remain free of serious  rules \nviolations  and  who  have  satisfactorily  participated  in  any  recommended \nrehabilitative programs that were made available to them will, within two  years at \n  8 \n\nthe latest, be released  from administrative segregation and will be housed in \n general population housing at the appropriate security level,  unless:  (A) the \nprisoner murdered another person while incarcerated; (B) the prisoner planned or \nparticipated in a major riot; (C) the prisoner escaped from a secured perimeter or \nfrom custody or direct supervision and while on escape caused serious physical \ninjury to another; or (D)  the Commissioner or his designee determines, based on \nspecific objective criteria set forth in writing, that there is a significant risk that \nthe prisoner will cause physical injury to prison staff, other prisoners, or members \nof the public if he is housed in general population, even at the highest security \nlevel.    Defendants will maintain a current list of all prisoners in administrative \nsegregation with the date of and reason for placement, date of last review, and, in \ncase where the prisoner is being held in administrative segregation pursuant to \nsubparagraph D, above, the written statement of the objective criteria relied upon.   \n \n23.   By January 31, 2008, Defendants will develop a formal policy establishing \na program whereby all prisoners in administrative segregation can through good \nconduct earn increased privileges and access to programs.  \n \n24.  Defendants represent that as of the date of this agreement there are a total \nof 152 cells in Unit 32 with solid-front doors.  Fifty of these solid-front cells are \noccupied as of the date of this agreement.  Defendants agree that the current total \nof 152  solid-front doors in Unit 32 is adequate for existing security needs, and \nthat  they  will  not  increase  the  total  of  solid-front  doors  except  on  notice  to \n  9 \n\nPlaintiffs and when shown to be necessary to prevent serious bodily injury or \nmaintain security.  Medical staff will make daily visits to any prisoner housed \nbehind solid steel doors and mental health staff will visit at least weekly or more \noften as needed to ensure that the prisoner’s mental and  medical health needs are \nbeing met.  Defendants will review prisoners’ confinement in solid-front cells \nevery sixty days and will house prisoners in these cells no longer than necessary \nto prevent serious bodily injury or maintain security.          \n \n25.       Defendants will afford each Unit 32 prisoner notice of and documentation \nfor  all  MDOC  decisions  that  result  in  his  initial  placement  and  continued \nconfinement  in  administrative  segregation.   Each  Unit  32  prisoner  in \nadministrative  segregation  will  be  formally  reviewed  every  ninety  days  to \ndetermine the need, if any, for further confinement in administrative segregation \nand the level of privileges to be afforded the prisoner, including but not limited to \ncanteen, visits, telephone, recreational and congregate recreational activity, and \naccess  to  educational  and  rehabilitative  programs.   At  each  such  review \nDefendants will issue a written assessment of  the prisoner’s progress, and if \ncontinued  confinement  in  administrative  segregation  is  ordered  the  written \nassessment  will  detail  the  basis  for  the  prisoner’s  further  retention  in \nadministrative segregation and the specific actions the prisoner can take to be \nconsidered for release at subsequent reviews.      \n \n  10 \n\n26.       By June 1, 2008, Defendants will provide program space and staffing at \nUnit 32 for day room use, dining hall, education and other rehabilitative services, \nand recreational and congregate recreational activities (both indoors and outdoors) \nfor eligible Unit 32 inmates.   \n \nMISCELLANEOUS \n27.       The relief set forth in this Supplemental Consent Decree is narrowly \ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, \nand is the least intrusive means necessary to prevent an unreasonable risk of harm \nto the health and safety of the Plaintiffs.  The Court further finds, based on the \nevidence regarding current conditions at Unit 32, that the relief set forth above is \notherwise appropriate pursuant to the standard set forth in 18 USC § 3626(a). \n \n28.       The Parties agree that the terms of this Supplemental Consent Decree shall \nbe submitted to the Court for approval and that the Court shall retain jurisdiction \nto enforce the terms thereof.  \n   \nSO ORDERED, this            day of                         2007. \n \n                                                                        \nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  11 \n\nAgreed: \n \n \n \n                                                 \nCounsel for Plaintiffs       Dated:  November 13, 2007 \n \n \n                                                 \nCounsel for Defendants      Dated: November 13, 2007 \n  12 ",

On April 28, 2006, the Court entered a Consent Decree,(Dkt.\nNo. 24), after a fairness hearing in compliance with Rule 23 (e), Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.  The Court retained  jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this Consent Decree.\nPlaintiffs thereafter proceeded to monitor Defendants’ compliance. \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill  \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 2 of 13\nby correctional staff against prisoners are  thoroughly investigated and documented\nand that the use of excessive force is not tolerated.  The Parties agree to  work\ntogether in good faith to prepare a written plan to effectuate the goals of this\nparagraph, and to present the agreed-upon plan to the Court for approval.     \n(Dkt. No. 24).  Plaintiffs further request that the Court consolidate this motion with Plaintiffs’\npending motion on treatment of prisoners with mental illness (Dkt. No. 57).  Plaintiffs seek\nexpedited hearing since MDOC’s routine violation of Paragraph 11 of the Consent Decree and of\nits own policy on the use of force, combined with the lack of reasonably adequate mental health\ntreatment, the psychosis-inducing effect on the mentally ill of permanent administrative\nsegregation, and the culture of excessive force in Unit 32, create an imminent risk of serious\ninjury to all Presley class members, and especially to those with serious mental illness.      \nThe Use of Excessive Force in Unit 32  \nUnit 32, a super-maximum security facility, is a massive complex of five buildings housing\nabout 1000 men, most of them in segregation cells where they are locked down 23 to 24 hours a\nday, in total isolation. The June 2005 Complaint in this case alleged in detail how a combination\nof conditions in Unit 32 –  including the profound isolation and unrelieved idleness of solitary\nconfinement, the routine use of excessive force by security staff, and the gross deprivation of\nbasic mental health care – are likely to cause serious mental illness to emerge in previously\nhealthy prisoners, to cause psychosis and complete mental breakdown in less healthy prisoners,\nand to subject all the men confined there, as well as the men and women who work there, to \nsubstantial risk of physical injury, illness and premature death.  \nAlthough Unit 32 is supposedly used to incarcerate the most dangerous and incorrigible\noffenders in the State, in the most secure and restrictive setting possible, the Complaint alleged\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   2\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 3 of 13\nthat in reality the vast majority of the men housed in Unit 32 – for years, sometimes for decades –\ndo not have the kind of criminal or institutional history that would justify incarceration under\n“supermax” conditions.  Many prisoners were placed in Unit 32 for purely arbitrary reasons, or\nfor no discernible reason at all, and have never had a meaningful opportunity to contest their\nplacement there.  Many are confined there because they have special medical needs, are severely\nmentally ill, or have requested protective custody.  Even for those men whose history might\nwarrant the most highly restrictive custody, there is no justification whatsoever for the\nhorrifically brutal and dangerous conditions to which they are subjected.  (Complaint, Dkt. No. 1,\nParas. 1-3).\nThe Complaint also alleged that chronic and severe shortages in security staffing and\nDefendants’ failure to adequately train and supervise security staff put the lives of prisoners and\nprison employees in Unit 32 in constant peril; that corrections officers do not follow basic\nsecurity precautions; that some corrections officers sadistically bait and threaten prisoners, or\ngratuitously beat prisoners already in full restraint gear; and that “takedown teams” often forcibly\nextract shackled prisoners from their cells, spray them with a chemical agent that causes\nvomiting and shortness of breath, and then assault them. (Para. 24).  The Complaint alleged that\nsadistic abuse and excessive force by corrections staff create a serious risk of suicide in young or\nmentally ill prisoners (Para. 25) and provided examples.2   \n2The Complaint gave the example of Christopher Smiley, a youthful prisoner on\npsychiatric medications, who on November 25, 2003 threw water at a corrections officer.  The\nofficer screamed that she was going to kill him, and a take-down team of several officers was\nsummoned.  The officers gassed Smiley and – after putting him in full restraint gear – pushed,\npunched and dragged him into a hallway, where they severely beat him.  Smiley was taken to a\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   3\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 4 of 13\nIn July 2006, Plaintiffs’ psychiatric monitor, Dr. Terry Kupers, carried out an audit of the\ntreatment of mentally ill prisoners at Unit 32, and thereafter submitted a report to Defendants. \n(See  Dkt. No. 59,  Exhibit C).  Dr. Kupers’ report detailed Defendants’ almost total failure to\ncomply  with the mental health provisions of the Consent Decree.  \nAmong many other unresolved problems, Dr.  Kupers found that it is commonplace for\nprisoners with serious mental illness to be issued disciplinary tickets for disturbed behaviors  that\nare obviously driven by mental illness, and for prisoners with mental illness to be routinely \nsubjected to use of force, including immobilizing gas and  cell extractions. (See Dkt. No. 59,\nExhibit C,  p. 4).  Dr. Kupers found that “a vicious cycle” has been created, “wherein prisoners\nsuffering from mental illness become more disturbed in isolated confinement at Unit 32, their\nillness leads them to break rules – either they act out in response to hallucinated voices or they\ntry to harm themselves – then they are subjected to use of force (gassing, [cell] extractions) and\nforced to undergo even harsher conditions such as the special management isolation cells where\ntheir mental illness is further exacerbated and they breakdown or attempt to harm themselves\nholding tank and then brought back to a punishment cell on the tier, where he spent the following\nnight without any clothing or bedding, although the temperature dropped below freezing. \nOfficers refused to give him his psychiatric medications and denied him several meals.  The\nfollowing day, on November 26, an officer told him “you’d better be gone when I come to work\ntonight.”  Smiley told ranking officers about the beating and threats and begged to be moved. \nThey told him to set a fire if he wanted to be moved.  That night, Smiley was found dead in his\ncell, hanging in the corner near the sink.  A few weeks later, on December 16, 2003, Patrick\nPresley, a prisoner who was in Unit 32 simply because he needed protective custody, was found\nhanged in his cell.  \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   4\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 5 of 13\nanew.” (Dkt. No.  59, Exhibit C, p. 4).  Dr. Kupers made recommendations to Defendants on\nhow they might resolve these issues.3  \nOn November 21, 2006, Plaintiffs brought a motion for an evidentiary hearing . See Motion\nfor Civil Contempt Sanctions and for Other Equitable Relief  to Compel Defendants’\nCompliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Medical and Mental Health Care (Dkt. No. 57-\n60). On April 4, 2007, an evidentiary hearing commenced on Plaintiffs’ contentions that mentally\nill prisoners are denied basic psychiatric care, routinely subjected to gassing with chemicals and\nother use of excessive force for disturbed behaviors triggered by their mental illness; and that a\nlarge percentage of prisoners who are being incarcerated in administrative segregation in Unit 32\nhave serious mental illness which is being severely exacerbated by the harsh conditions of\nadministrative segregation.4   Plaintiffs’ evidence included the testimony of Defendants’\npsychiatrist Dr. Parveen Kumar, who is responsible for treating the mentally ill prisoners in Unit\n32;  the testimony of several prisoner witnesses; and the testimony of Dr. Kupers.   \nThe evidence showed that in Unit 32 Defendants do not follow their own policy on use of\nforce, which provides that  “[i]t is the policy of MDOC to restrict the use of physical force to\n3Dr. Kupers recommended, among other things, that MDOC resolve staffing shortages;\nprovide more training for custody staff about mental illness and suicide; cease the use of  special\nmanagement isolation cells and additional deprivations to manage psychiatric crises; improve the\ncrisis care at Unit 42 by (at the very least) assigning a qualified full-time mental health care\nprovider  on Unit 42's psychiatric wing; and pursue any of the multiple available options for\naccomplishing the objective of separating prisoners with mental illness from the other prisoners\non Unit 32. \n4The issues on medical care were resolved on April 4, 2007 in a Supplemental Consent\nDecree, which the Court entered as an order on April 16, 2007. (Dkt. No. 70).\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   5\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 6 of 13\ninstances of justifiable self-defense, protection of others, protection of property, prevention of\nescapes, and to maintain or regain control, and then only as a last resort and in accordance with\nappropriate statutory authority. In no even is physical force justifiable as punishment.” 5  \nMDOC policy permits the use of chemical agents against prisoners only “to prevent serious\ninjury to the offender or others, to prevent substantial property damage, to prevent loss of life or\nto prevent escape.”6 Dr. Kupers gave multiple examples of mentally ill prisoners in Unit 32 being\nrepeatedly and gratuitously sprayed with chemicals and otherwise punished, rather than treated\nfor the mental illness that drove their disruptive behaviors.   \nAmong many other examples, Dr. Kupers cited the case of James Coffield,  a seriously\nmentally ill inmate in Unit 32 who was severely brain damaged in March 2006 in a botched\nsuicide attempt and who now remains in a permanent vegetative state.  MDOC mental health \nrecords documented Mr. Coffield’s long history in Unit 32 of bizarre and disruptive behaviors,\nwhich the MDOC psychiatrist characterized as merely “manipulative,” and which security staff\npunished with increasingly harsh force, including repeated gassing with chemicals – until last\nMarch, when Mr. Coffield was found in his cell hanging by his neck.   Dr. Kupers testified that\nthe very same conditions that resulted in the Coffield tragedy exist to this day in Unit 32, and that\n5Mississippi Department of Corrections Policy Number 16-13, “Use of Force” (effective\ndate 11-01-2006), page 1.   MDOC policy also requires that “[a]ppropriate medical treatment by\ncertified personnel will be provided to all individuals exposed to chemical agents,” and that\n“immediately after exposure to chemical agents, institutional staff should transport offenders to\nthe clinic for examination.”  Id. at 2. \n6Mississippi Department of Corrections SOP Number 16-13-01, “Use of Force” (effective\ndate 11-01-2006), page 2.    \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   6\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 7 of 13\nthere are dozens more “Coffields” waiting to happen unless those conditions are changed.     \nThe Latest Documented Example of Excessive Force Against a Mentally Ill Prisoner\nOn April 25, 2007, new evidence emerged lending further support to Dr. Kupers’ findings.   \nKevin King, a mentally ill inmate in Unit 32,7  claimed that he had been severely beaten by an\nofficer the day after he was discharged from the psychiatric ward in Unit 42. \nAccording to Mr. King, he was in the shower stall in Unit 32-A when Officer Takeo Clark \nsignaled for the shower door to be opened, then rushed into the shower and beat Mr. King on top\nof the head with a pair of handcuffs until King’s head and upper body were drenched in blood. \nAfter Mr. King had been beaten, shackled,  led out of his cell, and made to kneel with his hands\ncuffed behind him, Correctional Officer Stevie Anderson sprayed pepper spray into the wound. \nVideotape and photographic evidence tend strongly to support Mr. King’s version of events, and\nto refute Defendants’ version.\nMDOC photographs taken immediately after the incident show Mr. King’s scalp opened at\nthe top of his skull, with lacerations so deep that the crown of the head appears deformed by a\nsharp bloody protrusion.  See Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F.  There are multiple lacerations around\nhis eyes, see Exhibit  B, and his head, face and shirt are drenched in blood.  See Exhibits E, F. \nOfficer Clark’s version of the incident was that Mr. King emerged from the shower and assaulted\n7MDOC records produced in discovery show that Mr. King is on the mental illness\ncaseload, that he has been diagnosed with  impulse control disorder,  that he has been  prescribed\nThorazine, and that he has been admitted to the psychiatric hospital at least twice.   He was most\nrecently discharged from the psychiatric hospital on February 12, 2007, the day before he was\nbeaten by Officer Clark.      \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   7\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 8 of 13\nhim, so he hit Mr. King  with a closed fist to subdue him.  Officer Clark received a few small\nscratches.  See Exhibits G, H, I.   \nThe MDOC Corrections Investigation Division Report of Investigation, relying on\nvideotape of the incident recorded by a stationary security camera, concluded that Officer Clark’s\naccount of\nthe incident was false in a number of material points, \n[as] substantiated by video footage depicting [Officer] Trainee Clark appearing to be\nradioing to the tower officer to open the shower door.  Once the door opened, Trainee\nClark stood in the doorway of the shower, and then appeared to lunge forward\ntoward Inmate King.  It did not appear that Trainee Clark attempted to restrain\nInmate King, prior to the shower door opening, nor did it appear that Inmate King\nattempted to exit the shower once the door opened. \nHowever, the report concluded, “since there are no cameras in the showers, investigators were\nunable to determine what actually occurred inside.”  Accordingly, despite the investigative\nfindings  that Officer Clark had lied repeatedly lied about the incident, and the photographic\nevidence that Officer Clark had severely beaten Mr. King without any plausible correctional\nexcuse, MDOC sustained a disciplinary charge against Mr. King for assault on an officer; while\nmaking no findings  as to whether excessive force had been used.   Officer Clark was allowed to\nresign – and hence will  presumably be eligible in future for re-employment in MDOC.  \nEven though the videotape does not show what happened between Officer Clark and Mr.\nKing inside the cell from which Mr. King emerged with his scalp slit open, the videotape does\ncapture what occurred immediately after the beating. Contrary to what Officer Anderson told\nMDOC investigators – that after King was on the floor in restraint gear Officer Anderson had to\nuse pepper spray  because King “jumped from the floor” – the videotape corroborates Mr. King’s\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   8\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 9 of 13\naccount that after he was beaten, placed in restraint gear, and made to kneel on the ground,\nOfficer Anderson gratuitously pepper-sprayed him. (See Exhibit J, Declaration of Lawrence\nCaldwell).  MDOC’s investigative report does mention that Officer Anderson used  pepper spray\nagainst King when King was in restraint gear on the floor, but the report simply ignores the\nvideotape evidence refuting Anderson’s justification for using chemicals against an incapacitated\nprisoner.8      \nLike James Coffield a year earlier, Mr. King has no doubt been a “problem” inmate: \nAccording to MDOC records, in 2004 - 2005 he was charged with approximately sixty rules\nviolations ranging from beating on the cell floor, being loud and boisterous, and refusing to\nremove his arm from his tray slot, to setting fires, flooding the tier, destroying a mattress and\nother state property, throwing  urine at staff, striking other inmates, striking an officer,\nthreatening an officer, rolling his wheelchair towards an officer, and taking an overdoes of pills. \nHowever, also like Mr. Coffield,  Mr. King has a documented history of mental illness. MDOC’s\nown psychiatrist has diagnosed him with Impulse Control Disorder, admitted him to the\npsychiatric ward, and prescribed him powerful anti-psychotic medication.  The disturbed and\ndestructive behaviors for which MDOC has repeatedly punished him are in all likelihood a\nmanifestations of serious untreated mental illness.  Just as in the Coffield case, MDOC’s\npsychiatrist characterized these disruptive behaviors as mere “manipulation.”  \n8See MDOC Corrections Investigation Division: Report of Investigation 07-MSP-025, p.\n4 (\"When [Officer Anderson] entered the building, Trainee Clark had Inmate King on the floor,\nin handcuffs. Officer Anderson stated that he and Charles Westmoreland, CO-IV, placed Inmate\nKing in restraint gear. [Officer Anderson] stated that, when Inmate King was on the floor, Inmate\nKing jumped from the floor, and he sprayed Inmate King with one (I) burst of Oleoresin\nCapsicum (OC) Spray.\")\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   9\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 10 of 13\nMDOC’s Failure to Adequately Document Use of Force\nIn the past twelve months since the Consent Decree was entered,  Plaintiffs’ counsel has\nreceived  complaints from many Unit 32 prisoners about MDOC’s continuing use of excessive\nforce. Plaintiffs have reported a number of these incidents to Defendants and have requested\ndisclosure of the documentation of such incidents, including the videotapes of the incidents, as\nrequired by MDOC policy, which provides, “ when possible, all use of force incidents will be\nvideotaped (video camera with audio recording capabilities) to protect the rights of all involved\non the incident.” MDOC Policy No. 16-13, “Use of Force,” id. at 4.   \nUnfortunately, it appears that adequate documentation and investigation of excessive force\nclaims seldom if ever occur, in large part because the videotaping required by MDOC policy is \nnot taking place.  Security cameras are placed in such a way that the  interior of the cells are\nentirely hidden from view, what occurs inside the cell when officers enter is never recorded,  and\ncontrary to MDOC policy no sound recording is  made.  (See Exhibit J, Caldwell Declaration.) \nIn the absence of effective use of video recordings, MDOC’s internal investigations of\nexcessive force claims necessarily rely for the most part on the statements of correctional staff.  \nAs shown in the February 2007 Kevin King incident, even where MDOC’s own internal\ninvestigation concludes that security staff lied about material matters in the course of the\ninvestigation, any possible doubt is resolved in staff’s favor.  Indeed, in the King incident,\nMDOC’S investigative report of the incident concludes that “since there are no cameras in the\nshowers, investigators were unable to determine what actually occurred inside.”  \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   10\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 11 of 13\nEfforts to Resolve the Matter Without Court Intervention \nPrior to the filing of this Motion, Plaintiffs notified counsel for Defendants and attempted\nto negotiate an informal resolution without involving the Court, pursuant to Paragraph 17 of the\nConsent Decree.  \nOn April 4, 2007, at the close of Plaintiffs’ presentation of their evidence on mental health\nissues and use of excessive force against mentally ill prisoners,  the Court summoned the parties’\ncounsel  to chambers and strongly urged them to attempt to reach an agreement on how to\nremedy the serious problems that had been presented.  The parties agreed to attempt to negotiate\nan agreement on remedies, and to meet again with the Court on April 6 for further mediation.    \nThe evidence that had emerged at the hearing showed that the problems relating to\ntreatment of mentally ill prisoners, use of excessive force, and arbitrary classification to\nadministrative segregation are inextricably intertwined.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs drafted a\nproposed Supplemental Consent Decree addressing all of these issues and presented it to\nDefendants for discussion. \nOn April 6, 2007, counsel for the parties met at the courthouse and had preliminary\ndiscussions of Plaintiffs’ proposal.  Defendants’ counsel agreed to present the proposal to their\nclients.  Counsel then met again in chambers with the Court, who directed the parties to return on\nJune 1, 2007  for the continuation of the evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion, unless the\nparties were able in the interim to reach an agreement on remedies.   On May 1, 2007, not having\nhad any response from Defendants regarding their settlement proposal, Plaintiffs sent Defendants\nan updated draft and requested a response by May 11, 2007.  Defendants have yet to respond.   \nMDOC’s ongoing violation of Paragraph 11 of the Consent Decree and of its own policy on\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on Excessive\nForce and to Consolidate With Pending Motion to Compel Compliance With Consent Decree Provisions on\nTreatment of the Mentally Ill   11\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 74      Filed 05/21/2007     Page 12 of 13\nthe use of force, combined with the lack of reasonably adequate mental health treatment, the\npsychosis-inducing effect on the mentally ill of permanent administrative segregation, and the\nculture of excessive force in Unit 32, create an excessive and imminent risk of serious injury to\nall Presley class members, and especially to those with serious mental illness.     \n   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should consolidate the present motion with Plaintiffs’ pending motion on mental\nhealth care, hold an expedited hearing, and enter an order compelling Defendants to comply with\nthe requirements of Paragraph 11 of the Consent Decree that “all incidents of major force by\ncorrectional staff against prisoners are  thoroughly investigated and documented and that the use\nof excessive force is not tolerated,” and that the Parties “ work together in good faith to prepare a\nwritten plan to effectuate the goals of this paragraph, and to present the agreed-upon plan to the\nCourt for approval.”    \nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Margaret Winter \nMargaret Winter\nGouri Bhat \nTHE NATIONAL PRISON PROJECT OF THE\nACLU FOUNDATION, INC.\n 915 15th Street, N.W., Seventh Floor\nWashington, D.C. 20005\nTel.

No. 4:05-CV-00148 M-D    \n                        \nCHRISTOPHER EPPS, et al.,\nDefendants.\n________________________________________\nORDER ON JOINT MOTION OF THE PARTIES \nFOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROPOSED CONSENT DECREE\nBackground\nThe Parties, through their counsel, have jointly moved the Court for preliminary approval of\na proposed consent decree settling this litigation.  The Parties stipulate, and the Court upon review\nof the record finds, as follows:  \nPlaintiffs are members of a class consisting of  approximately one thousand prisoners who\nare confined in Unit 32 of Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP), Parchman, Mississippi.   On June\n22, 2005, through their counsel the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union,\nthe Mississippi ACLU, and Holland & Knight, LLP, they filed suit under 42 U.S.C. §1983,\nrequesting injunctive relief under the Eighth Amendment with respect to the conditions of their\nconfinement in Unit 32, and under the due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution, and they moved for class certification.  The case was assigned to U.S.\nMagistrate Judge Jerry A. Davis.    \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 24-1     Filed 03/06/2006     Page 2 of 5(cid:10)\nDefendants answered the Complaint on August 19, 2005, with general denials of every\nsubstantive allegation in the Complaint.  They sought and were granted an extension of time in\nwhich to respond to the Motion for Class Certification, to November 1, 2005.  Meanwhile,\nPlaintiffs’ counsel obtained discovery regarding certain key issues in the case,  through  tours and\nrecord reviews at Unit 32 by their medical and psychiatric experts.  The Parties’ counsel were\notherwise familiar with the facts underlying the Complaint through several years’ litigation,\ndiscovery, and ongoing monitoring of the injunction in Russell v. Johnson, Civil No. 1:02CV261-D-\nD (N.D. Miss.),  which concerns conditions of confinement and medical and mental health treatment\nfor the subclass of death row prisoners confined to Unit 32.  \nOn October 12, 2005,  Judge Davis suggested that the parties meet to discuss settlement of\nthe issues raised in the Complaint. Beginning on November 21, 2005 and continuing to the present,\nthe Parties engaged in a number of  lengthy discussions for the purpose of attempting to settle their\ndisputes underlying this action.  The Parties began negotiations at the Federal Courthouse in\nAberdeen, Mississippi, at the urging and under the aegis of Judge Davis, and then continued\nnegotiations on their own throughout December 2005 and January-February 2006. \nThose negotiations resulted in a proposed Consent Decree on February 15, 2005, which is\nattached to this Order as Attachment 1.  Pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the Plaintiffs and Defendants jointly move the Court to preliminarily approve the terms\nof the proposed Consent Decree and to enter the following Order, which incorporates the proposed\nConsent Decree:\nBASED ON THE PARTIES’ PROPOSED CONSENT DECREE AND THE ENTIRE\nRECORD BEFORE THE COURT, THE COURT FINDS:\n2\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 24-1     Filed 03/06/2006     Page 3 of 5(cid:10)\nThe proposed Consent Decree is the result of extensive arms-length negotiations between the\nParties after very substantial exchanges of information.  After reviewing the terms of the proposed\nConsent Decree in the context of the record in this action and controlling legal authority, the Court\nfinds the proposed Consent Decree is sufficiently reasonable, adequate, fair, and consistent with\nrelevant federal law to warrant preliminary approval and provision of notice to interested parties of\na Fairness Hearing.\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT:\n1.    The  proposed  Consent  Decree  that  appears  as  Attachment  1  to  this  Order  is\nPRELIMINARILY APPROVED and incorporated into this Order.  Final approval and entry of the\nDecree is subject to a hearing where the Court will hear objections to the proposed Consent Decree\nby interested parties.\n2.  For purposes of settlement, this case shall proceed as a class action pursuant to Rule\n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The class represented by Plaintiffs (the “Settlement\nClass”) is defined as:  “All prisoners who are now or will in the future be confined in Unit 32 of\nMississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi.”\n Notice Procedures\n3.    Within ten days of the date of this Order, notice shall be hand delivered, by appropriate\nrepresentatives of the Defendants, to each of the prisoners assigned to Unit 32.  The manner of\nNotice described above, and the form of Notice attached here as Attachment 2, are hereby found to\nconstitute the most effective and practicable notice under the circumstances, and to constitute due\nand sufficient notice for all other purposes to all persons entitled to receive notice required by due\nprocess and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n3\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 24-1     Filed 03/06/2006     Page 4 of 5(cid:10)\nFairness Hearing\n4.     The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on April 28, 2006, at 9:30 AM, at the United\nStates Courthouse, Aberdeen, Mississippi, at which time the Court shall consider the fairness of the\nproposed Consent Decree and whether the Court should approve it.\n5.    Any interested party may object to the proposed Consent Decree by filing an objection\nand, if he so desires, and in the discretion of the Court, by appearing at the Fairness Hearing.  To be\nconsidered by the Court, any objections to final approval of the proposed Consent Decree  must state\nthe basis for the objection and must be filed in writing, along with all other papers the objector\nwishes the Court to consider, not later than April 10, 2006.  Objections are filed by mailing them to\nthe Clerk of the United States District Court, P.O. Box 190, Greenville, Mississippi, 38701-0190,\nand mailing a copy to Counsel for Plaintiffs, National Prison Project of the ACLU, 915 15th Street,\nN.W., Seventh Floor, Washington, D.C., 20005, and a copy to Counsel for Defendants, Leonard\nVincent and Jim Norris, Mississippi State Penitentiary, P.O.. Box 38, Parchman, Mississippi 38738.\n In order for any attorney representing an objector to be heard at the Fairness Hearing, he or she must\nfile a Notice of Appearance with the Court and serve counsel for all Parties by April 10, 2006.  The\nCourt will not permit anyone who fails to timely file and serve a written objection to raise such\nobjection at the Fairness Hearing, except for good cause shown.  Anyone who fails to object in the\nmanner prescribed herein shall be deemed to have waived any such objection.\n6.   If objections are filed, the Parties’ counsel may engage in discovery concerning the\nobjections prior to the Fairness Hearing.  The Parties’ counsel shall serve on each other and file with\nthe Court, at least three calendar days prior to the Fairness Hearing, any further documents in support\nof the proposed Consent Decree, including responses to any papers filed by interested Parties.\n4\n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 24-1     Filed 03/06/2006     Page 5 of 5(cid:10)\nSO ORDERED in Aberdeen, Mississippi  this 6th day of March, 2006.\n/s/ JERRY A.

IT MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS ! \nThe Defendants have agreed to settle a class action lawsuit now pending in the United \nStates District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. The lawsuit was filed in June 2005 \nby the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Mississippi \nACLU, and Holland & Knight, LLP,  on behalf of four individual prisoners seeking relief for all \nprisoners confined in Unit 32 of the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, Mississippi.  The \nPlaintiffs claimed that the Mississippi Department of Corrections subjects the prisoners in Unit \n32 to inhumane living conditions and excessive force, deprives them of medical and mental \nhealth treatment, and denies them procedural due process in housing them in Unit 32.  The \nPlaintiffs asked for an injunction guaranteeing improved conditions for all prisoners housed in \nUnit 32, and they asked to be allowed, through their lawyers, to have the suit recognized as a \nclass action, so that any remedy they obtained would apply to all the prisoners in Unit 32. \nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO INFORM YOU OF: \nTHE STATUS OF THE LAWSUIT, INCLUDING A STATEMENT OF YOUR RIGHTS \nWITH RESPECT TO A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF THE CASE, INCLUDING A \nPROPOSAL TO HAVE THE CASE RECOGNIZED AS A CLASS ACTION; AND \nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE WITH THE COURT ANY OBJECTIONS \nYOU MAY HAVE TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \nNotice  to Class \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 40-2     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 2 of 5(cid:10)\n1.  The Settlement Class.  The Parties have agreed to and the Court has approved a \"Settlement \nClass\" pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b )(2).  The \"Settlement Class\" is \nmade up of all prisoners who are now or will in the future be confined in Unit 32 of the \nMississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi.  If the Court approves a \nsettlement of the Plaintiffs' Complaint, it will cover all members of the Settlement Class \nand it may affect your rights. \n2.  Proposal to Settle the Case By Adoption of a Consent Decree.  The Plaintiffs and \nDefendants have entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit by entering into a \"Consent \nDecree.\" No settlement will take place unless the Court decides to approve the proposed \nConsent Decree, after considering any and all objections that might be filed by members of \nthe Settlement Class (that is, prisoners confined in Unit 32). If the Court approves the \nproposed Consent Decree, the Court will issue the Consent Decree as a federal court order, \nand the Plaintiffs will be entitled to enforce it, through Plaintiffs' lawyers,  in federal court. \n3.  The Proposed Settlement Would Be Instead of a Trial If the proposed Consent Decree is \nadopted,  there will be no trial and the Consent Decree will require the Defendants to make \nspecified improvements in the living conditions and in the medical and mental health \ntreatment for all prisoners housed in Unit 32.  It will also require the Defendants to \nimplement a system whereby prisoners could challenge their assignment to Unit 32, and a \nsystem whereby Unit 32 prisoners could earn their way into less restrictive housing through \ngood behavior. If the case is not settled, it will eventually go to a trial and at the end of the \ntrial the Judge will decide whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to any remedies for their \ncomplaints, and if so what those remedies should be. \n4.  No Money Damages Are Involved in This Case.  The lawsuit does not involve money \ndamages, so whether or not this case settles or goes to trial, no class member will obtain \nmoney from the Defendants. \n5.  Enforcement of the Terms of the Proposed Consent Decree.  Under the terms of the \nproposed Consent Decree, Plaintiff's Counsel (the ACLU) and their experts would be \nauthorized to monitor conditions in Unit 32 and if necessary to bring proceedings in federal \ncourt to compel compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree.  The United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Mississippi would have continuing jurisdiction to \nenforce the provisions of the Consent Decree. \n6.  Terms of the Proposed Consent Decree. The terms of the proposed consent decree would \nrequire the Defendants to do the following: \nadequ(aAte)  celenasnuirneg t hsuatp pthliee cs ealnl dto e wquhiipcmh ean pt;r isoner is moved is clean prior to the move and provide \n(B) From May through September, ensure that each cell throughout Unit 32 is equipped \nNotice  to Class \n2 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 40-2     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 3 of 5(cid:10)\nwith a fan, and provide a 32-ounce cup of ice to each prisoner in Unit 32 three times a day; \nyear ro(uCn)d E; nsure that each prisoner is allowed to take a shower every day, six days per week, \n(D) Implement an effective mosquito eradication and pest control program; \n(E) Eradicate the problem of \"ping-pong\" toilets in every cell in Unit 32; \n(F) Make sure that the is adequate lighting in every cell; \nhealth( Gne)e Mdsa; ke sure that the medical services provider delivers adequate medical care for serious \nco-pay(Hm)e nEtns sfuorre s tehravti cmees;d ical service providers do not require prisoners to make unreasonable \n' \n(I)  Provide appropriate care for patients with chronic diseases; \npatien(tJs) i nP nroevedid oe fa tphporsoep sreiartvei coefsf;- site medical consultation, hospitalization, and specialty care for \n(K) Provide adequate mental health care; \nsepara(tLe) a nPdr oavpiadret  fhrooumsi nalgl  foothr eprr ipsroinsoenrse rws itthh apt sisy cahpopsrios parniadt es eivn elrieg hmt eonft tahl ehier aslpthec iilalnl enseseedss ; \n(M) Prevent excessive risk to prisoners of staph infection: \nfood p(oNrt)i onEsn saurer ea tdheaqtu faotoed,  atnrady tsh aarte f oporodp iesr lsye rcvleeda naetd a panpdro sparniaittiez eadn dp sriaofre  ttoe mfopoedr asteurrveisc;e , that \nlater th(0an)  JAullylo 1w,  2p0ri0s6o;n ers out-of-cell exercise and complete the new exercise pens completed no \ntporliesroant(eePdr)s;   aRree atshoonraobulyg helnys iunrvee tshtaigt aatlel di nacnidd ednotsc uomf menatejodr  afnodrc teh abty  tchoer urescet ioofn eaxl csetsasfifv aeg faoinrcset  is not \naapnprdipo eara pnl(,pQo eat)ain cldP;e  r aootv fl itedhaees  taf alalc  spteurmaislio -bnaaensrnesus w afloh rroe  tvahireee w aas sswsiigigtnhnm etdhe ent ots  taUom nUei tnr ii3gt2 h3, t2as, n oad f h nneooattr iiscneegn,, t oeapnnpc oeopdrt putoon ridttuyena titothy ,b  tweo  ihthea rd, \nNotice  to Class \n3 \n\nCase 4:05-cv-00148-JAD     Document 40-2     Filed 04/28/2006     Page 4 of 5(cid:10)\ntaon dle nsso(  trR ess)et nFritocertnimvceeud lha totoeu  sdaiennadgt .hi m mpalye,m tehnrot uag hp lgaono wdh beerheabvyi aolrl  apnrdis oa nsetersp -wdhoow nar sey asstesimg,n eedar tno  tUheniirt  w3a2y  \nDasiTlntesahcoctelr euo esmdbeute.ema  naiAnmtll   o acao forcf typo hty hpoe yeo ft   foetthe trfhrme tmhe Pse Ps r o Porafoprn topodhpose osec epsdodern Cd odC poCiotonionossnsenesednsen  tnsot D etDf tD ettehlceceercrme repeeeere  Snoh btpea yitosst  slw bfeeoermdiuet esinnnen dagtt tt  iAlttnoeag:m c trhheeeene dtam. c teotTnu httah elii ns oP  tnNrhlooiyspt  iconcosoeme.td ipc YCleeo odtueno  mseesan ynt  ot \nMargaret Winter I Gouri Bhat \nThe National Prison Project of the ACLU \n915 15th Street NW, Seventh Floor \nWashington, DC 20005. \n7.  tttpRihhmreeeoa e pscs eoltoahtsntsaelssetd.  m fw CoIeonron u Sntrl,esed aett htncnleheet  meirDndisegeeknc dtstrh . et oioesCf   pa calrroaneosn  ssufce anlCciufruoas, tivureooen ntarsh,ase iCbols ln hlecaaa asobsss lu eceCt o,ct ohnaourcnmonlduues dage idelhn de h atq aht ushtirs aaic attlae litr t haaeigennfua ddttle  ilparoyrmon eas, sn si aniaasb ln tylwhdeze  eeca ldobpl  neptashdestaei  ttil ihnsbo.ete ne nlrseee onfsigtftss tt h hoo efof   f \n8.  cNlaoi mEfsf efocrt  odna mCaagseess  fboror uMgohnt ebyy  DSeatmtlaegmeesn. t TChlaes psr mopeomsbeder Cs.o nsent Decree will  not affect any \n9.

Fairness Hearing:  After reviewing all the objections that were filed on time, Judge Davis \nwill hold a hearing on April28, 2006, at 9:30AM, in the U.S. Court House in Aberdeen, \nMississippi, to decide whether or not to approve the proposed Consent Decree.  If the \nJudge decides that the proposed Consent Decree is fair, adequate, and a reasonable \ncompromise of this case, then the proposed Consent Decree will become final. \n12.  Questions About the Proposed Consent Decree. If you have questions about the proposed \nConsent Decree or the settlement of this case or wish to review any of the documents in \nthis case, you may contact Plaintiffs' counsel by writing to: \nMargaret Winter I Gouri Bhat \nThe National Prison Project of the ACLU \n915 15111 Street N.W.,  Seventh Floor \nWashington, DC 20005-2302 \n13.  If the Court Does Not Approve the Proposed Consent Decree.  If, after the Fairness \nHearing, the·Court decides not to approve the Proposed Consent Decree, the proposed \nConsent Decree will be voided and will have no further effect. The case will not be settled, \nbut will go to trial. If that happens, there is no assurance that anydecision at trial will be in \nfavor of the class members; or that even if there is a a favorable trial decision, it will be as \nfavorable to the Plaintiffs as the Proposed Consent Decree would have been; or that any \nsuch favorable trial decision would be upheld on appeal. \nApproved this 6111  day of March, 2006 \nlsi JERRY A.
