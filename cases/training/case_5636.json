On August 7, 1995, I was hired as Administrative Assistant to tbe Engineering \nDepartment at TSA's corporate headquarters.  At the time of my hire, my direct supervisor was \nPaul Gates, Director of Engincering. \n2.  Beginning in or around September 1995, Alan Habe, TSA's Sales Manager, \nrepeatedly made inappropriate, inSUlting, and harassing comments to me because of my race, sex \nand national origin.  Mr. I-Iabe frequently made derogatory comments that I was an unmarried \nJapanese woman in her 30s.  He told me 1 should return to Japan to do \"house things.\"  Mr. Habe \nalso lold me I would end up in an \"old people's home\" alone if! did not marry soon.  Mr. Habe \ninsinuated lhatl had frequent sex pminers and boyfriends.  Mr. Habe also frequently commented \non my physical appearance and clothes. \n3  I promptly repolied Mr. Habe's harassing and discriminatory comments to Mr. \n(,ates but he took no remedial action. \n4.  In January 1996, Manual Tarsha replaced Mr. Gates as Dircctor of Engineering \nand Ms. Halakcyama's supervisor.  1 reported Mr. Habe's harassing comments to Mr. Tarsha. \n:VIr. Tarsha counseled Mr. Habe about his comments but no formal disciplinary action was taken \nagainst Mr. Habc. \n5.  From January 1996 llntil September 1997, Mr. Habe continually malic derogalury \nC0I11111cnls to me about being an ullmarried Japanese woman in her 305 \"\\lorking in Americ(l. \n6.  On September 15,  1997, 1 foulld \"lip marks\"'on a smallmirrOf in her cubicle that I \nthink Mr.  Habl.' had left as a kiss  my mirror  I reported the incidcntlO Mr.  rarsha. \n011 \n\n7.  Mr. Tarsha reported the situation to TSA President Hank Ogawa and Director of \nAdministration Yasuji Miki.  Mr. Ogawa replied that I had to be tough and had to Icam to take it. \nI-Ie told Mr. Tarsha that I was suffering from pre-menstrual syndrome or was unstable. \n8.  On October 3,1997, Mr. Ogawa told me, after 1 complained about another \nunrelated workplace issue, that he did not want problems in his company.  He told me that Mr. \nHabe worked very hard and did his job well.  He specifically told me that he was uncomf0l1ahie \nwith Illy report of finding lip marks on my mirror and that 1 should forget about what happened \nand keep quiet. \n9.  In November 1997, Mr. Tarsha gave me an \"above average\" performance review. \nlle specifically wrote that 1 was in a \"difficult situation\" as a Japanese national and stated I was \nsuffering from differential treatment. \n10.  In December 1997, I traveled to TSJ headquarters in Japan.  I delivered a letter \nfrom Mr. Tarsha to then-TSJ President Tobari specifically demanding he implement a training \nprogram to improve the Company's treatment of its women employees in general and Ms. \nHatakcyama in particular.  Mr. Tarsha informed Mr. Tobari that the Company needed to leam \n\"the traditions and laws pertaining to the treatment and interaction with women in the U.S.\" \nII.  During their meeting, Mr. Tobari and I discllsscd the harassing and discriminatory \ntreatment I was experiencing in the Company.  Mr. Tobari promised to talk to Mr. Ogawa about \ncorrective action and personally apologize for the Company's actions. \n12  While I was in .lapan, TSJ's Director of Marketing, Mr. Toda told me that the \nCompany should not have hired her.  He said single Japanese women should not he working and \nsaid he \\vorried that Japanese WOlnen were hccOllling \"Amencanized.\" \n2 \n\n13  When Mr. Ogawa learned that I had reported the harassment and discrimination \non account of sex, race, and national origin J was experiencing, he embarked upon a course of \nretaliation against me.  In or around January 1998, \\Ilr. Ogawa told  another TSA manager thatl \nwas \"the problem.\" \n14.  In early March 1998, I found an impression ofa penis on her cubicle mirror. \nrepotted this incident to Mr. Tarsha.  Mr. Miki rejected Mr. Tarsha's advice to contact the police \nand bring in an outside investigator.  [nstead, Mr. Miki said hc would handle it himself and took \npossession of the mirror. \n15.  At Mr. Tarsha's insistence, TSA employees underwent sexual harassment training \nin March 1998.  After the training Mr. Ogawa said to Mr. Tarsha that the best solution to the \nproblem was not to hire women.  Mr. Tarsha responded that Mr. Ogawa that his statements were \ndiscriminatory and that he had not learned anything trom the training. \n16.  In or around March 1998, I received a telephone call at home where all I heard \nwas heavy breathing. \n17.  Although Mr. Ogawa repeatedly stated in writing that TSA managers needed to \nundergo additional sexual harassment training, such training was not conducted. \n18.  In or around April 1998, my visa came up for renewal.  Mr. Ogawa initially \nrefused to renew it.  Mr. Tarsha informed him that the Company's action could appear to be \nretaliation for her reports of harassment.  Mr. Ogawa still refused to sign the visa, but ultimately \nauthorized Mr. Tarsha to ~ign it. \n19.  Even after the sexual harassment training conducted in March 1998, r was still \ncontinually subjected to a hostile work environment and discrimination in the terms and \nconditions of her employment based on her race, national origin and sex.  !vir. Habe continued to \n3 \n\nmake ridiculing comments that [ was an unmalTied Japanese woman.  Moreover, I was \nrepeatedly given demeaning work beneath her training and experience because I was a Japanese \n\\votnan. \n20.  In November 1998, Mr. Tarsha was removed as Director of Engineering. Before \nhis tem1ination, Mr. Tarsha prepared a favorable pcrfom1ancc review for me but TSA \nmanagement refused to give jt to me. \n2[.  Alier Mr. Tarsha's removal, I reported to Kai Vu, who was Mr. Tarsha's \nreplacement as Director of Engineering, and Mark Nishimura, an engineering manager.  Like Mr. \nHabe, Mr. Nishimura made derogatory comments to me because I was an unmarried Japanese \nwoman.  Although I again complained, TSA management took no remedial action. \n22.  Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Mr. Habe repeatedly told my co-workers \nthat I was \"dangerous\" and had a \"bad reputation.\"  As a result my co-workers ostracized me. \n23  As a direct result of my discriminatory and harassing work environment I \nexperienced severe emotional distress.  By 1999 the cumulative ciTeet of years of harassment \ncompelled me to usc some of my sick leave.  Al all times, I used  sick leave in compliance with \nTSA policies and at no time did I take sick leave in excess of the allotment to which I was \nentitled under TSA policies. \n24.  In August 1999 I received a critical performance review from Mr. Nishimura. \nThe review ordered me to improve my attendance and denied me a bOllus and salary increase \n011 \nthe purported basis orpoor allendance. \n25.  On September 27,1999, TSA terminated my employment. \n4 \n\n26.  On Octoher 21,1999, in response to my request for a signed written statement of \nthe reasons for my discharge, Mr. Miki claimed that the sale reason that my employment was \nterminated was my \"continued pattern orpaor attendance, despite repeated warnings.\" \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best ormy \nknow ledge. \n9£. .. \nId -c2 - ~~~ \nDate  Atusko Hatakeyama \n5 \n\nU.S. EQUAL I·:MPLOYMENT OPPORTU.'lITY COMMISSION \nSell tile Uistrict Office  Federal Office lluilding \n9(Jl} Fir:;t Avenue, Suite 400 \nFEB  2:; 2000 \nSeattle, WA98to4-1061 \n(206) 220-6883 \nTTY (206) 220-6882 \nFAX (206) 220-6911 \nEEOC Charge :-io.jXO;\\()()2(d \nAtsuko Hatakeyal11a  Charging Party \n940J-41nth pl.
