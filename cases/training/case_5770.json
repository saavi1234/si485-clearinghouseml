However, the consent decree indicates the EEOC alleged the defendant discriminated against the complainant, an employee with multiple sclerosis, by failing to make reasonable accommodation for the complainant in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The complainant intervened in the lawsuit in February 2002.  Following several changes of the trail date, the parties settled the lawsuit through a consent decree in February 2003.</p><p>The three year consent decree required the defendant to: report complaints to the EEOC, certify defendant has an anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy as well as a policy for responding to requests for reasonable accommodations from employees, keep records of complaints, permit the EEOC to monitor the facilities and training sessions, expunge complainant's employment record of reference to the lawsuit, post and distribute notice of employee rights, provide annual training, and agree to both comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and maintain the confidentiality of its employees' medical information. </p><p></p>",

TO PAY $95,000, IMPLEMENT TRAINING \nFOR FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE DISABLED WORKER\nMINNEAPOLIS - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today announced the settlement of\na disability discrimination lawsuit filed under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) against\nTarget Corporation for $95,000 to be paid to Susan Stombaugh, an employee who formerly worked in a Target\nstore in Bemidji, Minn.\nThe EEOC's lawsuit said that Target failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to Ms. Stombaugh, a qualified\nemployee with multiple sclerosis, when it refused to transfer her to a vacant position after her disability interfered\nwith her ability to perform her current job. Additionally, the EEOC contended that a Target supervisor had\ndisclosed information regarding her disability to another prospective employer. Target denied liability.\nIn addition to the monetary payment to the employee, Target agreed in the Consent Decree to abide by the terms\nof the ADA, provide training to its management personnel, maintain records as required by federal law, and\ncontinue to maintain its anti-harassment policy. The Consent Decree has been filed in the litigation of EEOC v. \nTarget Stores, Civ. No. 01-1646 DWF/AJB, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The\nEEOC filed suit after exhausting its conciliation efforts to reach a voluntary pre-litigation settlement.\n\"The ADA requires that an employer make reasonable accommodations for the disabilities of its qualified\nemployees, and that it keep medical information about its employees confidential,\" said Chester V. Bailey, the\nEEOC's District Director in Milwaukee. \"All the parties to this Consent Decree had a common goal - to make sure\nthat the law was followed and that the situation giving rise to this suit would not recur. We encourage other\ncompanies to be proactive in promoting an environment where persons are judged on their merits, and not upon\nmyths and stereotypes about their disabilities.\"\nMs. Stombaugh said she was pleased to resolve the matter and to continue working at Target:\n\"I really enjoy my job at Target. I have not experienced any problems since leaving my former store, and my\nsupervisors and coworkers have worked hard to assist and accommodate me in my current position,\" she said.\nLaurie A. Vasichek, Senior Trial Attorney in the Minneapolis EEOC office, stated: \"Many employers are not aware\nthat the ADA prohibits them from discussing their employees' medical condition with people checking references.\nIn this settlement, Target takes steps to prevent such disclosures, and other employers should follow its lead.\"\nVasichek also noted that ADA charges filed nationwide with the EEOC comprise about 20% of the agency's annual\ncaseload. Nearly 16,000 disability discrimination charges under the ADA were filed with the EEOC in Fiscal Year\n2002 (which ended on September 30, 2002).\nThe EEOC enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, which prohibits employment\ndiscrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; the\nEqual Pay Act; Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act which prohibits disability discrimination against\nemployees in the private sector and state and local governments; certain prohibitions in the Rehabilitation Act\nagainst discrimination affecting individuals with disabilities in the federal sector; and certain sections of the Civil\nRights Act of 1991.
