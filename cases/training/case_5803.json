The complaint states that a female employee alleged sex-based discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Specifically, the aggrieved employee alleged that a pharmacist routinely sexually harassed her and other female coworkers.  Also, the aggrieved employee stated that the pharmacist scrutinized female workers' work more than male coworkers' product.  The aggrieved employee complained about how she was treated and was terminated.   </p><p>In January of 2004, the parties settled and a consent decree was entered.  In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the aggrieved employee $40,000, not retaliate or discriminate on the basis of sex, issue a neutral reference letter for the aggrieved employee, post EEO notices, and provide EEO training for its staff.  The terms of the decree ran for eighteen months.</p><p></p>",
