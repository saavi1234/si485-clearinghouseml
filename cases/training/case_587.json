    "summary": "<p>On August 20, 1996, Muslim state prisoners housed at the California State Prison at Solano (Solano) filed a class action lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division.  The plaintiffs, representing themselves, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants violated their First Amendment rights to free exercise of their religion, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment rights to Equal Protection of the law.</p><p>On August 23, 1996, the District Court (Judge Eugene F. Lynch) transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, Sacramento Division.</p><p>On October 31, 1996, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Gregory G. Hollows) denied the plaintiffs' request for appointment of counsel. On January 30, 1997, Judge Hollows issued his Report and Recommendation, recommending dismissing the action.  Following plaintiffs' objections, Judge Hollows vacated his Report and Recommendation on April 11, 1997.</p><p>On June 25, 1997, Judge Hollows directed the clerk to send the file to the Civil Rights Clinic at U.C. Davis Law School, for possible representation of plaintiffs.  On July 24, 1997, Judge Hollows ordered other related cases stayed, pending the outcome of this case and another case (2:97-cv-625).  </p><p>The U.C. Davis clinic decided to take on the case, and entered an appearnce in October 1997.</p><p>On September 1, 1998, the Magistrate Judge Hollows recommended that the plaintiffs' class be certified as all present and future Muslim inmates at Solano.  On October 19, 1998, the District Court (Judge Frank C. Damrell, Jr.) adopted Judge Hollows' recommendation in full, and granted class certification with respect to the equitable relief claims.  The District Court, however, dismissed the plaintiffs' claims regarding their inability to purchase and possess religious oil and prayer beads.</p><p>After extended discovery, and settlement conferences in May and June of 2000, the parties settled four substantive issues and agreed upon an accelerated litigation process for two remaining issues.  On June 5, 2000, the Magistrate Judge Hollows memorialized and confirmed the agreements reached.  Under the Settlement Agreements, the defendants agreed to hire a full-time Muslim Chaplain, allow Muslims to special order religious oils, allow the Muslim community to wear religious headwear, make best efforts to ensure that a Muslim diet is available.  The parties agreed to litigate the disputed issues of beards and attendance at Juma'ah services.</p><p>On July 31, 2000, the District Court (Judge Lawrence K. Karlton) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction with respect to allowing Jumu'ah attendance, but denied it on the issue of defendants' prohibition of beards.  On December 19, 2000, the District Court (Judge Karlton) again granted a preliminary injunction allowing Jumu'ah attendance.  After the second preliminary injunction expired, on April 5, 2001, the District Court issued a successive preliminary injunction.  Mayweathers v. Terhune, 136 F. Supp. 2d 1152 (E.D. Cal. 2001).  The defendants appealed.</p><p>On July 2, 2001, the District Court (Judge Karlton) denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc.  The defendants appealed.</p><p>Significant litigation followed as to the District Court's preliminary injunctions.  On August 2, 2001, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Dorothy Wright Nelson) held that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it renewed the preliminary injunction.  Mayweathers v. Newland, 258 F.3d 920 (9th Cir. 2001).  </p><p>From December 2001 to January 2003, the District Court issued various preliminary injunctions on the issues of inmate attendance at Jumu'ah services, beards and grooming.  </p><p>On December 27, 2002, the Ninth Circuit (Judge Nelson) affirmed the District Court's denial of the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim under RLUIPA on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F. 3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2002).  The defendants' petitioned for a rehearing en banc.  On January 27, 2003, the District Court (Judge Karlton) held that the status quo of the preliminary injunctions would be preserved, including automatic renewal every ninety days, during the appeals process.  On October 6, 2003, the Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari.  Alameida v. Mayweathers, 540 U.S. 815 (2003).</p><p>On June 25, 2004, the District Court (Judge Karlton) granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and for a permanent injunction finding that the defendants' policies as to both grooming and attendance at Jumu'ah services violated RLUIPA.  The District Court permanently enjoined defendants from issuing any discipline to inmates for attending  Jumu'ah services or wearing half-inch beards for religious purposes.  The Court ordered that the parties to meet and confer concerning the issue of expunging past inmate discipline records relating to the contested issues.  Mayweathers v. Terhune, 328 F.2d 1086 (E.D. Cal. 2004).</p><p>The District Court awarded fees in the amount of $289,011 to plaintiffs' attorneys and taxed $23,675.38 in costs.</p><p>On September 6, 2006, the Ninth Circuit granted the defendants' motion to voluntary dismissal their appeal of the permanent injunction.</p><p>No further substantive action is noted on the PACER docket and the case was administratively closed.</p><p></p>",

CHAVEZ,\n19 Defendants.\n20\n21 Plaintiffs are a class of Muslim state prisoners housed at\n22 California State Prison-Solano seeking relief under 42 U.S.C.\n23 § 1983 for alleged violations of their First Amendment right to\n24 the free exercise of their religion, as well as their Fourteenth\n25 Amendment right to Equal Protection of the law.  This matter\n26 comes before the court on plaintiffs' motion to renew the\n1\n\ncourt's grooming injunction, and defendants' motion to stay its\nenforcement.1  The standards for such a morion are well-known\nand need not be repeated here.  See Topanga Press Inc. v. City\nof Los Angeles. 989 F.2d 1524, 1528  (9th Cir. 1993).\nDefendants asser* the balance of hardships tip in their\nfavor because the injunction forces CSP-Solano to create and\nimplement new institutional processes, procedures, and training,\nall of which causes defendants to divert significant time and\nresources.  The court considered these issues when it granted\n10 the preliminary grooming injunction.  The court found thar while\n11 \"not unsympathetic to the inconveniences that an injunction may\n12 cause to the prison staff at CSP-Solano . . . the court must\n13 weigh those conveniences against the fact that the grooming\n14 regulations likely violate RLUIPA and therefore infringe on\n15 privileges mandated by law . . . Accordingly, the court is\n16 convinced that the balancing test favors the inmates and\n17 commands injunc~ive relief.\"  See Order, dated February 8, 2002,\n18 at 16:17-17:9.  Because the court has previously considered the\n19 hardship to the parties, the court concludes that the argument's\n20 repetition here does not justify a stay of the enforcement of\n21 the grooming injunction.\n22\n23\n1  On February 8, 2001, the court granted plaintiffs' motion\n24\nfor a preliminary injunction, and prohibited defendants from\nimposing any form of discipline on plaintiffs for wearing beards\n25\nno longer than one-half inch in length during the pendency of this\naction.  See Order, dated February 8, 2001, at 19:5-8  (\"grooming\n26\ninjunction\").\n\n4/b\nDefendants also contend that because they have a likelihood\nof success on the merits of their claim that the Religious Land\nUse and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et.\nseq.  (\"RLUIPA\"), is unconstitutional, enforcement of the\ngrooming injunction should be stayed.  Because the court has\nalready concluded that RLUIPA is constitutional, see Order,\ndated July 2, 2001, at 18:12-13, zhe court cannot agree that the\nargument justifies a stay.\nPlaintiffs also move for a second preliminary injunction\n1C identical to the court's grooming injunction.  They argue that\n11 the court may summarily reenter a preliminary injunction based\n12 upon the principles of the law of the case.\n13 The law of the case doctrine requires that when a court\n14 decides on a rule, it should ordinarily fellow that rule during\n15 the pendency of the case.  See Arizona v. California, 460 U.S.\n16 605  (1983).  It is, of course, merely a prudential doctrine;\n17 nonetheless, the doctrine guides the court's discretion on\n18 issues such as the one at bar.  See Slotkin v. Citizens Cas.\n19 Co..  614 F.2d 301, 312  (1979)  (The law of the case \"does not\n20 constitute a limitation on the court's power but merely\n21 expresses the general practice of refusing to reopen what has\n22 been decided.\")  \"The rule of practice promotes finality and\n23 efficiency of the judicial process by  'protecting against the\n24\nagitation of settled issues . . . .'\"  Christianson v. Colt\n25\nIndus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816  (1988).\n26\n\nWOODOO D/b\nGrounds justifying departure from the law of the case\ninclude substantially different evidence, a change in\ncontrolling authority or the need to correct a clearly erroneous\ndecision which would work a manifest injustice.  See White v.\nMurtha, 377 F.2d 428, 431-432  (5th Cir. 1967).\nDefendants' contentions were previously argued and rejected\nwhen the court denied defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs'\nRLUIPA claim.  See Order, dated July 2, 2001, at 1-18.  The\ncourt affirms its prior rejection of these contentions because\n10 the defendants have failed to identify substantially different\n11 evidence, a change in the controlling legal authority, or any\n12 error in the court's prior decision.  See id.  Defendants' only\n13 additional argument is the balance of hardships question, to\n14 which the court concluded above, falls in plaintiffs' favor.\n15 For the foregoing reasons, the court hereby makes the\n16 following ORDERS:\n17 1.  Defendants' motion to stay enforcement of the grooming\n18 injunction is DENIED; and\n19 2.  Plaintiffs' motion for a second preliminary grooming\n20 injunction is GRANTED.\n21 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n22 DATED:  April 25, 2002.\n23\n24\nLAWRENCE\n25 SENIOR\nUNITED\n26\n\nndd\nUnited States District Court\nfor the\nEastern District of California\nApril 26, 2002\n* * CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE * *\n2:96-cv-01582\nMayweathers\nv.\nSutton\nI, the undersigned, hereby certify that I am an employee in the Office of\nthe Clerk, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California.\nThat on  April 26, 2 002, I SERVED a true and correct copy(ies) of\nthe attached, by placing said copy(ies) in a postage paid envelope\naddressed to the person(s) hereinafter listed, by depositing said\nenvelope in the U.S. Mail, by placing said copy(ies) into an inter-office\ndelivery receptacle located in the Clerk's office, or, pursuant to prior\nauthorization by counsel, via facsimile.\nSusan Dee Christian  SJ/LKK\nLaw Offices of Stewart Katz\n1001 G Street  CF/JFM\nSuite 100\nSacramento, CA  95814\nTami M Warwick\nAttorney General's Office\nPO Box 944255\n1300 I Street\nSuite 125\nSacramento, CA  94244-2550\nJohn K Vincent\nUnited States Attorney\n501 I Street\nSuite 10-100\nSacramento, CA  95 814\nMarc D Stern\nNOT EDCA ADMITTED\nAmerican Jewish Congress\n15 East 84th Street\nNew York, NY  10028\nJack L",

The Lau Court observed that Congress had not exceeded the limits of the Spending Clause by requiring federal\nfunds recipients to comply with Title VI because \" '[s]imple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all\nraces contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination.\" '\nId.at789(quoting110Cong.Rec.6543(Sen.Humphrey,quotingfromPresidentKennedy'smessagetoCongress,June19,\n1963)).\n©2005Thomson/West.NoClaimtoOrig.U.S.Govt.Works.\n\nNotReportedinF.Supp.2d FOREDUCATIONALUSEONLY Page4\n2001WL804140(E.D.Cal.)\n(Citeas:2001WL804140(E.D.Cal.))\nIn essence, RLUIPA seeks to ensure that federal funds are in no way used to suppress religious freedom.

See Lau, 414 U.S. 583. Moreover, as I now explain, even if the Dole\nrelatednessstandardapplied,RLUIPA'spurposeisrelatedtothepurposesunderlyingthefederalfunding.\nRLUIPA's provisions are directly related to the rehabilitation of federal inmates housed in state prisons. According to\ndefendants, the California state prison system currently receives federal funding in exchange for housing federal prisoners\nandINSdetaineeswhowouldotherwisebekeptatfederalinstitutions.Hadthoseprisonerbeenhousedinfederalinstitutions,\nthey would enjoy protection of their religious freedoms under the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, see 42 U.S.C. §\n2000bb-1 (\"RFRA\"). In enacting RFRA, Congress found that religion played a vital role in the rehabilitative process for\nsomeinmates.See,e.g.,139Cong.Rec.S578(dailyed.Oct.27,1993)(statementofSen.Hatch)(\"[E]xposuretoreligionis\nthe best hope we have for rehabilitation of a prisoner. Most prisoners, like it or not, will eventually be returning to our\ncommunities.\") RLUIPA seeks to extend the protection of religious freedom embodied in RFRA to, inter alia, federal\ninmates housed at state institutions. In sum, as to those prisoners, the rehabilitative concerns underlying RFRA apply with\nequal force to the concerns underlying RLUIPA, and thus, are germane to the purpose of the federal funding. Moreover, as\nnoted, to the extent that Congress has determined that rehabilitation of prisoners limits the commission of crimes, a result\nwhich clearly affects the general welfare, the extension of the act to state prisoners is also well within the germaneness\nlimitationoftheSpendingClause.\niv.IndependentConstitutionalBar\nFinally, defendants argue that the RLUIPA is unconstitutionally coercive because it conditions the receipt of all federal\nfundinguponcompliancewithRLUIPAandnotjustapercentageofthefederalfundsaswasthecaseinDole.Icannotagree.\n*5 Although the Dole Court noted that some prior decisions had \"recognized that in some circumstances the financial\ninducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which 'pressure turns into compulsion,\" ' it\nultimately concluded that \"to hold that motive or temptation is equivalent to coercion is to plunge the law in endless\ndifficulties.\" Dole, 483 U.S. at 211 (quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 589-590 (1937)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Steward Machine Court, itself, expressed doubt as to whether the concept of coercion \"can\never be applied with fitness to the relations between state and nation.\" 301 U.S. at 590. Instead, the Court has, over time,\n\"beenguidedbyarobustcommonsensewhichassumes\"thatstatesemploytheir\"freedomofthewill\"inchoosingwhether\nto accept or reject conditional grants of federal financial assistance.

Contrary to defendants' suggestion,\nhowever, the Court did not hold that government protection of religious freedom ran afoul of the Establishment Clause. In\nfact, each opinion in that case disavowed any notion that government action to mitigate the impact of burdens on religion\nviolates the Establishment Clause.

NELSON, Senior Circuit Judge. \nCalifornia State prison officials (\"California\") bring a facial challenge to the constitutionality \nof the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et \nseq. (2000) (\"RLUIPA\"), on various grounds. Their appeal arises from a series of \npreliminary injunctions, issued pursuant to RLUIPA, which allow Muslim prisoners to attend \nFriday afternoon religious services. \nThe district court upheld the statute as a constitutional exercise of Congress's Spending \nClause authority. We affirm.[1] \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nRLUIPA protects prisoners and other institutionalized people from government infringement \non their practice of religion. Specifically, the statute prescribes that \"[n]o government shall \nimpose a substantial burden on the religious exercise\" of prisoners unless the government \ncan demonstrate that the burden both serves a compelling government interest and is the \nleast restrictive means of advancing that interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a) (2000). \nA class of Muslim inmates imprisoned at Solano in California originally filed suit in 1996 \nagainst various officials of the California State prison system. They alleged 1066*1066 that \nprison rules penalizing attendance at Friday afternoon religious services, called Jumu'ah, \nviolated the First Amendment. They added a RLUIPA claim following its enactment in 2000. \nCalifornia moved to dismiss the RLUIPA claim, arguing that the statute exceeded \nCongressional authority under the Spending Clause, the Commerce Clause, and the \nFourteenth Amendment. California also attacked the statute as violative of the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment, the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments, and \nthe principle of separation of powers. The United States intervened to defend RLUIPA as \nconstitutional. \n\nIn a series of separate but related rulings, the district court upheld the constitutionality of \nRLUIPA, denied California's motion to dismiss, and granted the prisoners various \npreliminary injunctions. These injunctions barred prison officials from punishing prisoners for \nattending Jumu'ah services and prohibited officials from withholding good time credits from \ninmates who participated in Jumu'ah while this case proceeds. \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nWe review the constitutionality of a statute de novo. Eunique v. Powell, 302 F.3d 971, 973 \n(9th Cir.2002). \nIII. The Spending Clause \nThe Spending Clause allows Congress to further its policy objectives by conditioning the \nreceipt of federal funds on compliance with federal mandates. See South Dakota v. Dole, \n483 U.S. 203, 206, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). This power is not limitless, \nhowever. A statute properly passed under the Spending Clause must meet certain \nrequirements. First, the statute must be in pursuit of the general welfare. Id. at 207, 107 \nS.Ct. 2793. Second, any conditions on federal grants must be unambiguous, clearly \ncommunicating to states the consequences of their participation in the federally funded \nscheme. Id. Third, the Supreme Court has suggested that conditional federal grants \"might \nbe illegitimate if they are unrelated to the federal interest in particular national projects or \nprograms.\" Id. (internal quotations and citation omitted) (emphasis added). Finally, other \nconstitutional provisions may provide independent grounds for invalidating an otherwise \nproper exercise of Congress's Spending Clause authority. Id. at 208. RLUIPA meets all of \nthese requirements, and the statute is a legitimate exercise of Congressional spending \npower. \nA. Promoting the General Welfare \nCongress possesses great leeway to determine which statutory aims advance the general \nwelfare. The Supreme Court has made it clear that \"[w]hen money is spent to promote the \ngeneral welfare, the concept of welfare or the opposite is shaped by Congress....\" Helvering \nv. Davis, 301 U.S. 619, 645, 57 S.Ct. 904, 81 L.Ed. 1307 (1937). The Court, in the leading \ncase on Spending Clause authority, reaffirmed that federal courts must \"defer substantially\" \nto Congress in determining if a statute advances the general welfare. Dole, 483 U.S. at 207, \n107 S.Ct. 2793. In fact, the Court seems doubtful that failure to advance the general welfare \ncould ever provide adequate grounds for invalidating a federal statute. Id. at 207 n. 2, 107 \nS.Ct. 2793. \nIn any event, protecting religious worship in institutions from substantial and illegitimate \nburdens does promote the general welfare. The First Amendment, by prohibiting laws that \nproscribe the free exercise of religion, demonstrates the great value placed on protecting \nreligious worship from impermissible government 1067*1067 intrusion. By ensuring that \ngovernments do not act to burden the exercise of religion in institutions, RLUIPA is clearly in \nline with this positive constitutional value. Moreover, by fostering non-discrimination, \n\nRLUIPA follows a long tradition of federal legislation designed to guard against unfair bias \nand infringement on fundamental freedoms. See, e.g., Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. \n(2002); Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (2002); Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (2002). No \nsound reason exists to disturb Congress's finding that RLUIPA promotes the general \nwelfare. \nB. Unambiguous Condition \nRLUIPA unequivocally states that it applies to any \"program or activity that receives Federal \nfinancial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(1). A spending power statute, as \nunambiguous in its conditional language as RLUIPA, ensures that the statute's intention to \nimpose a condition is expressed clearly. By its plain language, RLUIPA clearly \ncommunicates that any institution receiving federal funds must not substantially burden the \nexercise of religion absent a showing that the burden is the least restrictive means of \nserving a compelling government interest. The fact that the least restrictive means standard \nis perhaps unpredictable because it has resulted in different determinations in different \ncourts does not weaken the express conditional language. In fact, the Supreme Court has \nheld that conditions may be \"largely indeterminate,\" so long as the statute \"provid[es] clear \nnotice to the States that they, by accepting funds under the Act, would indeed be obligated \nto comply with[the conditions].\" Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 24-25, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). Congress is not required to list every \nfactual instance in which a state will fail to comply with a condition. Such specificity would \nprove too onerous, and perhaps, impossible. Congress must, however, make the existence \nof the condition itself — in exchange for the receipt of federal funds — explicitly obvious. \nRLUIPA unambiguously creates this condition. \nC. Relatedness to the Federal Interest in National \nProjects or Programs \nThe Supreme Court has suggested that federal grants conditioned on compliance with \nfederal directives might be illegitimate if the conditions share no relationship to the federal \ninterest in particular national projects or programs. Dole, 483 U.S. at 207, 107 S.Ct. 2793. \nThis possible ground for invalidating a Spending Clause statute, which only suggests that \nthe legislation might be illegitimate without demonstrating a nexus between the conditions \nand a specified national interest, is a far cry from imposing an exacting standard for \nrelatedness. The nonconclusive language leaves open the possibility for attacking a \nspending power statute on this basis, but it does not mean that a statute is automatically \nillegitimate. \nThe Court has stated more recently that \"[s]uch conditions must ... bear some relationship \nto the purpose of the federal spending.\" New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167, 112 \nS.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (citation omitted). The conditions in RLUIPA do share \nsuch a relationship. Congress has a strong interest in making certain that federal funds do \nnot subsidize conduct that infringes individual liberties, such as the free practice of one's \nreligion. The federal government also has a strong interest in monitoring the treatment of \nfederal inmates housed in state prisons and in contributing to their rehabilitation. Congress \nmay allocate federal funds freely, then, to protect the free exercise of religion and to \n\npromote rehabilitation. If the Supreme Court has in fact imposed a low-threshold \nrelatedness test, RLUIPA satisfies it. \n1068*1068 D. Independent Constitutional \nProscriptions \nThe inquiry does not end with the conclusion that RLUIPA is a valid exercise of Congress's \nSpending Clause authority.[2] Other constitutional provisions may provide independent \nbases for striking RLUIPA. Dole, 483 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. 2793. \ni. The Establishment Clause \nThe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits any government from enacting \na law that would respect the establishment of religion. While this clause forbids Congress \nfrom advancing religion, the Supreme Court has interpreted it to allow, and sometimes to \nrequire, the accommodation of religious practices: \"This Court has long recognized that the \ngovernment may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do \nso without violating the Establishment Clause.\" Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n \nof Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 144-45, 107 S.Ct. 1046, 94 L.Ed.2d 190 (1987). Moreover, \"in \ncommanding neutrality the Religious Clauses do not require the government to be oblivious \nto impositions that legitimate exercises of state power may place on religious belief and \npractice.\" Bd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Vill. Sch. Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 705, 114 S.Ct. \n2481, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994). \nThe three-part test developed in Lemon v. Kurtzman helps determine whether an \naccommodation statute achieves this neutrality by avoiding \"sponsorship, financial support, \nand active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\" 403 U.S. 602, 612, 91 S.Ct. \n2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971) (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 668, 90 S.Ct. \n1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)). A statute will survive an Establishment Clause attack if (1) it \nhas a secular legislative purpose, (2) its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, \nand (3) it does not foster excessive government entanglement with religion. Id. at 612-13, \n91 S.Ct. 2105. \na. Secular Purpose \nJust because RLUIPA addresses religion does not mean that its purpose is religious in \nnature. The secular purpose requirement does not \"mean that the law's purpose must be \nunrelated to religion — that would amount to a requirement that the government show a \ncallous indifference to religious groups, and the Establishment Clause has never been so \ninterpreted.\" Corp. of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 335, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 97 \nL.Ed.2d 273 (1987) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Nothing in RLUIPA indicates \nthat wholly impermissible purposes, such as the advancement of religion, underlie RLUIPA. \nSee Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 603, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has upheld statutes that \"alleviate significant governmental \ninterference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious \nmissions.\" Corp. of Presiding Bishop, 483 U.S. at 335, 107 S.Ct. 2862. RLUIPA intends a \n\nsecular legislative purpose: to protect the exercise of religion in institutions from \nunwarranted and substantial infringement. \nb. Primary Effect \nThe primary effect of RLUIPA neither advances nor inhibits religion. It does not impose \naffirmative duties on states that 1069*1069 would require them to facilitate or subsidize the \nexercise of religion. RLUIPA instead calls for exactly the opposite — forbidding states from \nimposing impermissible burdens on religious worship so that prisoners may practice their \nreligion free from unlawful interference. The statute does not violate the Establishment \nClause just because it seeks to lift burdens on religious worship in institutions without \naffording corresponding protection to secular activities or to non-religious prisoners. \nRLUIPA merely accommodates and protects the free exercise of religion, which the \nConstitution allows. See Corp. of Presiding Bishop, 483 U.S. at 338, 107 S.Ct. 2862. \nc. Excessive Entanglement \nFinally, RLUIPA does not foster excessive government entanglement with religion. The \nstatute, on its face, does not require \"pervasive monitoring\" to prevent the government from \nindoctrinating religion. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 233, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d \n391 (1997) (citation omitted). RLUIPA does not call on the federal government to supervise \nprisons and institutions closely to make sure federal funds do not sponsor religious \npractices. Unlike conferring a tax exemption on a religious organization or awarding aid to a \nfaith-based school, RLUIPA removes burdens on religious exercise rather than according \nbenefits. Likewise, RLUIPA does not require prison officials to develop expertise on \nreligious worship or to evaluate the merits of different religious practices or beliefs. The \nstatute itself defines religious exercise, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A), and requires only that \nstates avoid substantially burdening these practices without a compelling justification. \nBecause RLUIPA has a secular legislative purpose, its primary effect is neither to advance \nnor inhibit religion, and it does not foster excessive government entanglement with religion, \nRLUIPA does not violate the Establishment Clause. \nii. The Tenth Amendment \nRLUIPA does not usurp the regulation of a core state function in violation of the Tenth \nAmendment. True, the prosecution and punishment of crime remains a basic police power. \nSee Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 47, 107 S.Ct. 353, 93 L.Ed.2d 216 (1986). However, \nRLUIPA does not regulate the operation of prisons. Under the statute, prison officials \nremain free to run their prisons as they see fit. RLUIPA just prohibits prison officials from \nunduly burdening inmates' free exercise of religion in the process. \nThe Tenth Amendment \"[does] not concomitantly limit the range of conditions legitimately \nplaced on federal grants.\" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, 107 S.Ct. 2793. While Congress may not \nhave authority to commandeer the management of state prisons, it \"does have power to fix \nthe terms upon which its money allotments to states shall be disbursed.\" Id. (citation \n\nomitted). If states disagree with the requirements of RLUIPA, they remain free to forgo \nfederal funding and opt out of its mandates.[3] \niii. The Eleventh Amendment \nThe Eleventh Amendment does not bar this suit against California State prison officials \nunder RLUIPA. Citizens of a state may not sue their own state. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. \n1, 10, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890). This case, by contrast, involves a suit by citizens \nof California 1070*1070 against officials of the State of California for prospective injunctive \nrelief. Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). This case falls \nsquarely within the Ex Parte Young exception to sovereign immunity and does not violate \nthe Eleventh Amendment. \niv. The Principle of Separation of Powers \nRLUIPA likely is a response to Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. \n1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), which held that laws of general applicability that incidentally \nburden religious conduct do not offend the First Amendment. RLUIPA raises this standard \nby requiring states to demonstrate that prison regulations substantially burdening the free \nexercise of religion are the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government \ninterest. RLUIPA does not erroneously review or revise a specific ruling of the Supreme \nCourt because the statute does not overturn the Court's constitutional interpretation in \nSmith. See Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341-43, 120 S.Ct. 2246, 147 L.Ed.2d 326 (2000). \nRather, RLUIPA provides additional protection for religious worship, respecting that Smith \nset only a constitutional floor — not a ceiling — for the protection of personal liberty. Smith \nexplicitly left heightened legislative protection for religious worship to the political branches. \nSmith, 494 U.S. at 890, 110 S.Ct. 1595. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nWe hold that Congress did not exceed its Spending Clause power in enacting RLUIPA. \nAFFIRMED. \n[1] We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292(a)(1). \n[2] Having established that RLUIPA satisfies the first three elements of the Dole test, we hold that Congress had the \nauthority under the spending power to pass this statute. Accordingly, we need not decide whether Congress also had \nthe authority to pass RLUIPA under the Commerce Clause. \n[3] Federal funding comprises less than one percent of California's annual prison operating budget. \n ",

CHAVEZ,\n19 Defendants.\n20\n21 Plaintiffs are a class of Muslim state prisoners housed at\n22 California State Prison-Solano seeking injunctive relief\n23 relative to certain California Department of Corrections'\n24 (\"CDC\") regulations, which they allege impinge on their\n25 religious practices.  This matter is before the court on\n26 plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.  I decide this\n\nmotion based on the papers and pleadings filed herein and after\noral argument.\n3 I.\n4 PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nPlaintiffs originally sued defendants under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 alleging that the CDC's regulations violated their rights\nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United\nStates Constitution.  On September 8, 1999, plaintiffs moved for\na preliminary injunction enjoining the CDC from enforcing the\n10 regulations insofar as they, inter alia, prohibited beards of\n11 any length unless it was deemed medically necessary.1\n12 Plaintiffs sought a religious exemption to allow them to wear\n13 half-inch beards.  Pursuant to Local Rule 72-302 (c) (17), the\n14 matter was referred to Magistrate Judge Moulds who, after a\n15 hearing, issued Findings and Recommendations.\n16\nI\"7  :  The amended regulations are embodied in  15 Cal. Code Regs.\n§ 3062(h) which provides:\n18\nAn inmate's  face shall be clean shaven at all times,\n19 except as follows:\n20 (1) Mustaches are permitted for male inmates and shall\nnot extend below the top of the upper lip, and shall\n21 extend  to the  corner  of the mouth  but  not more  than\none-half inch beyond the corner of the mouth.\n22\n(2)  An exemption from shaving shall only be authorized\n23 by  the  appropriate  Institutions  Division's,  Regional\nAdministrator  and  only  when  an  exemption  is  deemed\n24 medically necessary by a physician.  Such exemption must\nnot  exceed  ninety  days.  If  the  condition  persists,\n25 another exemption request  shall be submitted.  Facial\nhair permitted by such an exemption shall not exceed 1/4\n26 inch in length.\n\nOn July 31, 2000, the court adopted the magistrate judge's\nFindings and Recommendations and denied plaintiffs' motion for a\npreliminary injunction relative to the regulation of beards. See\nOrder, dated July 31, 2000, at 2:18-3 : 3:24 .2  The court,\nhowever, also denied defendants' motion for summary judgment\nwith respect to this claim.  See id., at 4:12-15.\nOn December 19, 2000, the court granted plaintiffs' motion\nfor leave to file an amended complaint, allowing them to bring\nan additional cause of action under the Religious Land Use and\n10 Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000  (\"RLUIPA\"), codified as 42\n11 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc e£ seq.  See Order, dated December 19, 2000, at\n12 9:5-9.  Plaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction premised\n13 on the provisions of that Act.\n14 II.\n15 THE RELIGIOUS LAND USE AND INSTITUTIONALIZED PERSONS ACT\n16 RLUIPA provides that \"[n]o government shall impose a\n17 substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person\n18 residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if the\n19 burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the\n20\n2  The court considered plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary\n21 injunction under the standards announced in Turner v. Safley, 482\nU.S. 78, 89-90 (1987).  Under Turner, the Supreme Court held that,\n22 'when a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional\nrights, the regulation  is valid  if it is reasonably related to\n23\nlegitimate penological interests.\"  Id. at 89.\n24 3  Because of the new standards provided by RLUIPA, the court\ngranted the parties leave to tender additional evidence and set an\n25\nevidentiary hearing.  The parties waived the hearing and submitted\ntheir new evidence in writing.  That evidence is part of the record\n26\nconsidered in this order.\n\ngovernment demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that\nperson  . ..  is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest  [] and . ..  is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling interest.\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-l(a).\nThe Act applies to any \"program or activity that receives\nFederal financial assistance.\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-l (b) (1) and\n(2) .\nTo assert a claim under RLUIPA, plaintiff must produce\n\"prima facie evidence to support a claim alleging a violation of\n10 the Free Exercise Clause  . . . .\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2 (b).  The\n11 government, however, \"shall bear the burden of persuasion on any\n12 element of the claim, except that plaintiff shall bear the\n13 burden of persuasion on whether the law  (including a regulation)\n14 or government practice that is challenged by the claim\n15 substantially burdens the plaintiff's exercise of religion.\"\n16 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2 (b) .\n17 RLUIPA further provides that it shall be \"construed in\n18 favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the\n19 maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the\n20 Constitution.\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3 (g).  Given the provisions\n21 and the mandated mode of construction, I turn to plaintiffs'\n22 motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\n1 III.\n2 PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nA.  STANDARD\nThe purpose of the preliminary injunction as provided by\nFed. R. Civ. P. 65 is to preserve the relative positions of the\nparties —  the status quo —  until a full trial on the merits\ncan be conducted.  See University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451\nU.S. 390, 395  (1981).  The limited record usually available on\nsuch motions renders a final decision on the merits\n10 inappropriate.  See Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, 456  (1973).\n11 \"The  [Supreme] Court has repeatedly held that the basis for\n12 injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been\n13 irreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.\"\n14 Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo. 456 U.S. 305, 312  (1982).  In the\n15 Ninth Circuit, two interrelated tests exist for determining the\n16 propriety of the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  The\n17 moving party carries the burden of proof on each element of\n18 either test.  See Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v.\n19 National Football League. 634 F.2d 1197, 1203  (9th Cir. 1980).\n20 Under the first \"traditional\" test, the court may not issue a\n21 preliminary injunction unless each of the following requirements\n22 is satisfied:  (1) the moving party has demonstrated a likelihood\n23 of success on the merits, (2) the moving party will suffer\n24 irreparable injury and has no adequate remedy at law if\n25 injunctive relief is not granted,  (3) in balancing the equities,\n26 the non-moving party will not be harmed more than the moving\n\nparty is helped by the injunction, and  (4) granting the\ninjunction is in the public interest.  See Martin v.\nInternational Olympic Committee, 740 F.2d 670, 674-75  (9th Cir.\n1984).\nUnder the second \"alternative\" test, the court may not\nissue a preliminary injunction unless the moving party\ndemonstrates either \"probable success on the merits and\nirreparable injury . ..  or . ..  sufficiently serious questions\ngoing to the merits to make the case a fair ground for\n10 litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in favor\n11 of the party requesting relief.\"  Topanga Press Inc. v. City of\n12 Los Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524, 1528  (9th Cir. 1993)(citations\n13 omitted).  The Ninth Circuit has explained that the two parts of\n14 the alternative test are not separate and unrelated, but are\n15 \"extremes of a single continuum.\"  Benda v. Grand Lodge of\n16 International Association of Machinists, 584 F.2d 308, 315 (9th\n17 Cir. 1978), cert, dismissed, 441 U.S. 937  (1979).  We are taught\nthat the critical element within this alternative test is the\n19 relative hardship to the parties.  See id.  \"[T]he required\n20 degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of\n21 success decreases.\"  United States v. Nutri-cology Inc., 983\n22 F.2d 394, 397 (9th Cir. 1992) (citations and internal quotation\n23 marks omitted).  Even if the balance tips sharply in favor of\nthe moving party, however, \"it must be shown as an irreducible\n25 minimum that there is a fair chance of success on the merits.\"\n26 International Olympic Committee, 740 F.2d at 674-75. (citation\n6\n\nomitted).\n2 B.  SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN ON AN INMATES' RELIGIOUS EXERCISE\n3 Plaintiffs assert that their religion requires that they\nwear beards.  It is uncontested that inmates who refuse to shave\ntheir beards in conformity with CDC regulations are subjected to\nprogressive penalties, culminating in placement on \"C-Status,\"\nwhich prevents inmates from earning good-time credits.  See 15\nCal. Code Regs. §§ 3062(m) & 3315(f).  Defendants nevertheless\nclaim that the amended grooming regulations do not substantially\n10 burden plaintiffs' religious beliefs because they assert that\n11 Muslim men are not required to wear beards.  Defendants submit\n12 that a beard is not regarded as obligatory within the Islamic\n13 faith because it is not commanded by the Qu'ran.  See Suppl.\n14 Decl. Imam Abdul Hasan, at 2 SI 4.  Below, I explain why\n15 defendants' argument is misplaced.\n16 I begin by noting that defendants' argument is precluded by\n17 the statute.  RLUIPA provides that a religious exercise includes\n18 \"any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or\n19 central to, a system of religious belief.\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n20 5(7)(A).  Moreover, as I have previously explained, First\n21 Amendment doctrine also constrains judicial evaluation of the\n22 centrality of religious practices to a particular creed, as\n23 contrasted with its centrality to a particular practitioner.\n24 See Rouser v. White. 944 F. Supp. 1447, 1454  (E.D. Cal. 1996).\n25\n26\n\nPut directly, the relevant question in determining the\ncentrality of particular religious beliefs or practices is \"not\nwhat others regard as an important religious practice, but what\nthe plaintiff[s] believe[].\"  Id. (citing Hernandez v.\nCommissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 699  (1989)); Bryant v. Gomez, 46\nF.3d 948, 949 (9th Cir. 1995).  \"Abjuring inquiry into whether\nthe orthodox interpretation of a religion requires a particular\npractice, as contrasted with the subjective understanding of the\nplaintiff[s] as to [their] religious needs, is required by\n10 virtue of the fact that  '[c]ourts are not arbiters of scriptural\n11 interpretation.'\" Id. (citing Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana\n12 Employment Sec. Division, 450 U.S. 707, 716  (1981)).  See also.\n13 Ward v. Walsh. 1 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"In  religious\n14 matters we take judicial notice of the fact that often the\n15 keenest disputes and the most lively intolerance exist among\n16 persons of the same general religious belief who, however, are\n17 in disagreement as to what the faith requires in particular\n18 matters.\").\n19 Plaintiffs assert that they may not shave their beards\n20 based upon their religious convictions.  In support of their\n21 beliefs, plaintiffs tender evidence from their expert, Imam\n22 Ibrahim Hamdani, who declares that growing a beard demonstrates\n23 a man's faith and loyalty to his religion, and thus is\n24 obligatory.  See Depo. Imam Ibrahim Hamdani at 69-70, 124-125.\n25\n26  ////\n\nIndeed, defendants' expert also acknowledges that \"[t]he\npractice of growing a beard originated from the Prophet\nMuhammad's command to the Muslims to be different from the\npolytheists . . .\"  and while not mentioned in the Qu'ran, \"is a\npractice mentioned in the sirah  (biography) or hadiths  (saying\nof Prophet Muhammad  (PBUH)).\"  See Suppl. Decl. Imam Abdul\nHasan, at 2 SI 3, 3 SI 6.  Imam Hamdani avers that the required\nlength of a beard varies among scholars of Islam, but if an\nindividual cannot grow their beard longer, for whatever reason,\n10 it is acceptable for them to wear a beard as short as one-half\n11 inch in length. See Depo. Imam Ibrahim Hamdani, at 69:4-6, 78:2-\n12 79:1, 124:19-125:6.\n13 The court finds that the evidence supports plaintiffs'\n14 affirmation that wearing a beard is, for them, a legitimate\n15 religious practice.  Because the defendants have not raised a\n16 question concerning plaintiffs' sincerity, the court concludes\n17 that the grooming regulations impose a substantial burden on\n18 plaintiffs' \"religious exercise\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.\n19 § 2000cc-l(a).4\n20\n21\n22\n23 4  One possible way of evaluating the issue is that Imam\nHasan's averment that wearing a beard is not required of Muslims\n24\nraises a question of plaintiffs' sincerity.  Because there is\nsignificant evidence to the contrary, however, I conclude that the\n25\nevidence  does  not  bear  on  their  sincerity  of  beliefs, but  on\nquestions of orthodoxy, which, as noted in the text, are beyond the\n26\npower of this court to judge.\n\nC.  COMPELLING STATE INTEREST\nDefendants assert that the grooming regulations are\nnecessary to identify inmates for the purpose of preventing\nescapes and controlling movement within the prison.  Of course,\nboth of the articulated concerns are legitimate governmental\ninterests; the question, however, is whether the regulations\nlegitimately address those concerns, or are an exaggerated\nresponse to them.  Turner, 452 U.S. 78, 90.\nDefendants tender evidence that the grooming regulations\n10 were implemented in response to a number of escapes from\n11 different institutions after inmates altered their appearances.\n12 See Depo. Anthony Newland, at 39:15-40:13; 62:13-65:3; 64:6-\n13 65:3; Defendants' Opposition, at Exh. G 11 3, 6-7.  Defendants\n14 also submit that a beard of any length changes the appearance of\n15 a prisoner and compromises the process of identifying inmates or\n16 escapees.  See Defendants' Opposition, at Exh. E SI 5, G 11 2-3.\n17 Finally, defendants assert that correctional officers need to\n18 quickly identify inmates to prevent assaults, riots, or\n19 disturbances, and that without these amended regulations this\n20 process would become impossible if an inmate quickly changed his\n21 appearance by shaving his beard.  See Defendants' Opposition, at\n22 Exh. E, n  3, 4, 6, 8-9; Exh. G, 1 2, 3.\n23 Plaintiffs respond with evidence that the safety and\n24 security concerns tendered by defendants are largely\n25 exaggerated, and do not justify the imposition of grooming\n26 regulations prohibiting beards.  Plaintiffs' expert, George\n10\n\nSullivan, who has more than forty years of experience in\ncorrections, declares that he is unaware of any instance where\nan inmate escaped from prison solely by changing his appearance.\nSee Decl. George Sullivan at fi 3, 12.  Sullivan opines that the\nincidents of escape cited by CDC officials were taken out of\ncontext, without acknowledgment of the additional circumstances\nthat permitted each escape.  Id.  Moreover, Sullivan avers that\nSection 3287(b) of the grooming regulation should alleviate\ndefendants concerns about identification since it requires\n10 \"visual daily inspections . ..  to ensure compliance with\n11 departmental grooming standards.\"  See Decl. George Sullivan, at\n12 13 (citing 15 Cal. Code. Regs. § 3287(b)).\n13 Defendants rationale that an inmate with a beard can more\n14 easily alter his appearance after he escapes does not persuade.\n15 Common sense and experience recognizes that a prisoner may not\n16 only shave, but alter his appearance in any number of ways to\n17 evade authorities after escape.  Moreover, while it is plausible\n18 that altering a six inch beard, or cutting very long hair may\n19 assist an escapee to elude capture, I must agree with Judge\n20 Strand that shaving a half-inch beard likely cannot.  See\n21 Luckette v. Lewis, 883 F. Supp. 471, 481 (D. Ariz. 1995)(\"prison\n22 officials do not meet their burden of demonstrating a compelling\n23 interest for not allowing a short, kempt beard\"); Fromer v.\n24 Scully, 874 F.2d 69, 74 (2d Cir. 1989) (\"[i]t is certainly not\n25 irrational to believe that a full beard, which may well extend\n26 for significant lengths sideways from the cheeks as well as\n11\n\ndownwards from the chin, may impede identification more than a\none-inch beard\").  As Magistrate Judge Moulds concluded \"[w]hen\nit comes to changing one's appearance through the growth or\nremoval of hair, this court finds that not all beards are\nequal.\"  See Findings and Recommendations, dated March 29, 2000,\nat 30:10-12.\nIt may be, as defendants maintain, that the grooming\nregulations make it easier for prison officials to identify\ninmates as they move through the prison system, or for purposes\n10 of capture if an inmate escapes.  Moreover, it may be at trial\n11 that defendants can prove that more than mere administrative\n12 convenience is at stake.  For now, however, the court notes that\n13 the CDC acknowledges \"appearances can change from day to day,\"\n14 and it is for that reason that § 3287(b) requires daily visual\n15 inspection so as to ensure that prison officials are aware of an\n16 inmate's appearance.  See 15 Cal. Code. Regs. § 3287(b).\n17 Finally, I note that the defendants are not faced with the\n18 specter of prisoners constantly changing their appearance.\n19 Surely an inmate who grows a beard for assertedly religious\n20 reasons and then shaves without compulsion, provides evidence\n21 suggesting that the inmate does not have a legitimate religious\n22 conviction.  See Luckette, 883 F. Supp. at 481.\n23 For all the above reasons, the court concludes that the\n24 plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing for preliminary\n25 injunction purposes, that the grooming regulations are an\n26\n12\n\nexaggerated response to a legitimate concern.5\nD.  LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS\nBecause I concluded above that the plaintiffs have made a\nsufficient showing that the regulations are an exaggerated\nresponse to defendants' security concerns, it follows that\ndefendants have not demonstrated that the regulations are the\nleast restrictive means of achieving legitimate government\npurposes.\nAs explained above, the grooming regulations themselves\n10 provide one alternative.  Section 3287 (b) of 15 Cal. Code Regs,\n11 requires mandatory visual daily inspections of inmates' facial\n12 hair.  These inspections should alleviate concerns about an\n13 inmate's ability to engender confusion by radical alterations in\n14 appearance.  Nor does the concern that escapees may change their\n15 appearance require a different result.  Prison officials can\n16 address the risk of an inmate avoiding detection by shaving his\n17 beard by requiring two photographs of that inmate: one with his\n18 face clean shaven, and one with a half-inch beard.  Luckette,\n19 883 F. Supp. at 481  (finding that photographing an inmate with a\n20 short beard may make it easier to differentiate that inmate from\n21\n5 The Supreme Court has reminded us that courts have no\n22 expertise in running prisons.  On the other hand, as this case\ndemonstrates, prison officials are focused on security issues.  If\n23 RLUIPA teaches anything, however, it is that even in prison our\nsociety does not value security beyond all other interests.\n24 Congress has determined that other, equally important needs, must\nbe addressed.  Once that determination has been made, under our\n25 system of government it is the federal courts which are obligated\nto evaluate whether prison officials have honored the Congressional\n26 judgment.\n13\n\nothers without beards); see also Ross v. Couahlin, 669 F.Supp.\n1235, 1240-41  (S.D.N.Y. 1987)  (upholding an \"initial shave\"\nrequirement to obtain a photograph of inmates without a beard to\nlater assist in their identification if they shave their\nbeards).6  Indeed, prior to the current grooming regulations,\nprison officials took additional photos of inmates who altered\ntheir appearance during incarceration through the growth of\nhair.  See Findings and Recommendations, dated March 29, 2000,\nat 32:1-5.  Defendants produce no evidence that resuming this\n10 practice would result in a significant cost to the institution.\n11 Because there appear to be ready alternatives to the\n12 prohibition of beards, defendants have not used the least\n13 restrictive means of accomplishing its goals of prison security\n14 and easy identification of prisoners.  See Ashelman v.\n15 Wawrzaszek, 111 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"the  existence of\n16 alternatives may be evidence that the [policy] is not reasonable\n17 but is an ^exaggerated response' to prison concerns.\")\n18 For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that plaintiffs have\n19 demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n20 claim that the grooming regulations violate RLUIPA.\n21\n22 6 In Friedman v. State of Arizona, 912 F.2d  328  (9th Cir.\n1990), the Ninth Circuit rejected a  before and after photographic\n23\nalternative under Turner v. Safely. 482 U.S. 78 (1987),  concluding\nthat the proposed alternative \"impose[d] more than a de minimis\n24\ncost to valid penological interests.\" Id. at 332.  Under RLUIPA,\nTurner's \"de minimis\" standard does not apply, but rather the court\n25\nmust  consider  whether  the  state's  regulation  is  the  least\nrestrictive means of achieving the goal sought.  Thus, Friedman\n26\nprovides no guidance in the matter at bar.\n14\n\n1 E.  IRREPARABLE INJURY\n2 It is true that under current Supreme Court doctrine the\nright of a prisoner to wear a beard does not necessarily invoke\nFirst Amendment concerns.  See O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 4 82\nU.S. 342, 349 (1987)(\"[P]rison regulations alleged to infringe\nconstitutional rights are judged under a 'reasonableness' test\nless restrictive than that ordinarily applied to alleged\ninfringements of fundamental constitutional rights\")  (citation\nomitted).  Nevertheless, clearly Congress, to the degree it is\n10 able, has made the right to practice one's religion an important\n11 right of prisoners.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et. seq.  Here,\n12 prisoners have already been subjected to progressive discipline\n13 and consequent hardship for refusing to shave their beards.  See\n14 Depo. Mayweathers, at 14:3-8, 7-17; 35:6-36:7; 81:14-88:23;\n15 Depo. Jihad, at 68:18-69:4, 99:9-17.  Without an order enjoining\n16 the grooming regulations and allowing plaintiffs to grow half-\n17 inch beards, plaintiffs may lose the opportunity to earn time\n18 off from their sentences, face restricted visiting hours, be\n19 restricted from canteen draw, lose time outside their cells,\n20 lose work credits, and be denied the opportunity to attend\n21 Jumu'ah.  See Depo. Mayweathers, at 14:7-17, 15:3-13, 35:6-36:7;\n22 Depo. Jihad, at 99:16-100:15.\n23 Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiffs present\n24 substantial evidence to demonstrate that they will suffer\n25 irreparable injury if they fail to comply with the grooming\n26 regulations.\n15\n\nF.  BALANCING THE EQUITIES\nGiven the court's conclusion that the plaintiffs have\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, and also a\nstrong showing of irreparable injury, the next step is to\nbalance the equities.  That is because \"a federal judge sitting\nas chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an\ninjunction for every violation of the law.\"  Amoco v. Village of\nGambell. 480 U.S. 531, 542  (1987).7\nDefendants submit that if the injunction is issued, the\n10 officials at CSP-Solano will have to set up a system to\n11 implement this religious exemption, including identifying Muslim\n12 inmates who claim such an exemption and checking to ensure their\n13 new beards comply with the proposed one-half inch limit.  Prison\n14 officials would also have to change the status and privileges of\n15 those Muslims who are now on \"C\" Status for refusing to shave\n16 their beards, but are willing to trim them to a half-inch.\n17 The court is not unsympathetic to the inconveniences that\n18 an injunction may cause to the prison staff at CSP-Solano.\n19 Nevertheless, the court must weigh those inconveniences against\n20 the fact that the grooming regulations likely violate RLUIPA and\n21 therefore infringe on privileges mandated by law.  Moreover,\n22\n23 7  While, of course, nothing about granting an injunction\nshould be viewed as automatic, it has always seemed to this court\n24 that it would take a strange set of circumstances requiring the\ncourt to continence a violation of law.  Having said as much, for\n25 the reasons expressed in the text, the court is satisfied that the\nmatter at bar does not present circumstances justifying unlawful\n26 conduct on the part of the CDC.\n16\n\nalthough the Supreme Court has held that in light of the\nplaintiffs' incarcerated status their ability to protect their\nFirst Amendment rights have been constricted, see O'Lone, 482\nU.S. at 349, there can be no question that, vel non, plaintiffs'\nclaims implicate practices falling within the scope of the First\nAmendment.8  Accordingly, the court is convinced that the\nbalancing test favors the inmates and commands injunctive\nrelief.9\nG.  BOND\n10 No preliminary injunction shall issue \"except upon the\n11 giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court\n12 deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may\n13 be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been\n14 wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 (c).  It\n15 is, however, \"well settled that Rule 65(c) gives the court wide\n16\nThe Supreme Court has taught that \"[t]he loss of First\n17 Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"  Elrod v. Burns,\n18 427 U.S. 347, 373  (1976); accord Jacobsen v. United States Postal\nService, 812 F.2d  1151, 1154  (9th Cir. 1987) (violation of First\n19\nAmendment Rights \"is, each day, an irreparable injury\").\n20 9 Several of defendants' arguments were previously rejected\nby the court when it granted plaintiffs' preliminary  injunction\n21 with respect to Jumu'ah attendance.  For a second, and in some\ncases third time, defendants argue that RLUIPA is unconstitutional,\n22 that this court lacks jurisdiction to proceed on plaintiffs' claims\nunder RLUIPA, and that a grant of plaintiffs' motion for a\n23 preliminary injunction would establish an impermissible\ngovernmental preference for religion.  The court affirms its prior\n24 rejection of these contentions because the defendants have failed\nto identify substantially different evidence, a change in\n25 controlling  legal authority, or any error in the court's prior\ndecisions.  See White v. Murtha, 377 F.2d  428, 431-32  (5th Cir.\n26 1967).\n17\n\ndiscretion in the matter of setting security.\"  Natural\nResources Defense Counsel v. Morton. 337 F. Supp. 167, 168\n(D.D.C. 1971)(motion for summary reversal dismissed), 458 F.2d\n827 (D.C. Cir. 1972).  See also  Urbain v. Knapp Bros. Mfg. Co.,\n217 F.2d 810, 815-16  (6th Cir. 1954); Dovne v. Saettele. 112\nF.2d 155, 162 (8th Cir. 1940).\nIn considering the appropriate amount of the bond, I note\nthat the named plaintiffs are represented by counsel, but are\nall institutionalized.  Clearly, if such plaintiffs were\n10 \"required to post substantial bonds . ..  in order to secure\n11 preliminary injunctions . . .,\" the bonds might undermine\n12 mechanisms for private enforcement of the law.  Friends of the\n13 Earth v. Brineaar, 518 F.2d 322, 323 (9th Cir. 1975) (reducing\n14 bond in NEPA case from $4,500,000 to $1,000); accord Morton, 337\n15 F. Supp. at 169 (bond set at $100); Environmental Defense Fund\n16 v. Corps, of Engineers. 331 F. Supp. 925  (D.D.C. 1971)(bond set\n17 at $1).  The court is \"unwilling to close the courthouse door in\n18 public interest litigation by imposing a burdensome security\n19 requirement.\"  State of Ala, ex rel. Baxlev v. Corps of\n20 Engineers. 411 F. Supp. 1261, 1276  (N.D. Ala. 1976).\n21 Accordingly, bond is set in the amount of One Dollar.\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n18\n\n1 IV.\n2 ORDERS\n3 For the foregoing reasons, the court hereby makes the\nfollowing ORDERS:\n1.  Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is\nGRANTED, to wit: defendants may not impose any form of\ndiscipline on plaintiffs for wearing beards no longer than one-\nhalf inch in length during the pendency of this action;\n9 2.  Plaintiff shall POST bond in the amount of $1.00; and\n10 3.

BENNETT; \n18  and  F.X.  CHAVEZ, \n19  Defendants. \n____________________________________ ! \n20 \n21  Plaintiffs  are  a  class  of  Muslim  state  prisoners  housed  at \n22  California  State  Prison,  Solano  who  sought  relief  under,  inter \n23  alia,  the  Religious  Land  Use  and  Institutionalized  Persons  Act \n24  of  2000,  Pub.L.  No.  106-274,  114  Stat.  803,  codified  at  42 \n25  U.S.C.  §§  2000cc  et  ~ (\"RLUIPA\"),  for  alleged  violations  of \n26  the  right  to  the  free  exercise  of  their  religion.  The \n15~ \n\n1  defendants  included  the  Director  of  the  California  Department  of \n2  Corrections  (CDC),  the  Warden  of  CSP-Solano,  and  various  other \n3  supervisory  employees  of  the  CDC  at  CSP-Solano.  This  matter \n4  comes  before  me  on  plaintiffs'  motion  for  an  award  of  attorney's \n5  fees  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1988  for  work  done  until  October \n6  14,  2001. 1  I  decide  the  matter  based  on  the  papers  and \n7  pleadings  filed  herein. \n8  I. \n9  STANDARDS  FOR  AWARDING  ATTORNEY  FEES  UNDER  42  U.S.C.  §  1988 \n10  This  attorney's  fee  motion  is  governed  by  42  U.S.C.  §  1988, \n11  and  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  (PLRA).  Section  1988 (b) \n12  provides that  \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a  provision \n13  of  ... 42  U.S.C.  §§  1981-1983,  ... [or]  the  Religious  Land  Use \n14  and  Institutionalized Persons Act  of  2000,  .. the  court,  in its \n15  discretion,  may  allow  the  prevailing party,  other  than  the  United \n16  States,  a  reasonable  attorney's  fee  as  part  of  the  costs.\" \n17  The  PLRA  allows  an  award  of  attorney's  fees  in  prisoner \n18  litigation where  \"the  fee  was  directly and  reasonably  incurred  in \n19  proving an actual violation of  the plaintiffs'  rights protected by \n20  a  statute pursuant  to which a  fee  may be  awarded under section 1988 \n21  of  this  title.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  1997e(d) (1)  (A). \n22  To  determine  the  amount  of  a  fee  award  to  a  prevailing party \n23  pursuant  to  Section  1988,  the  court  determines  the  \"lodestar\" \n24 \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  enforcement  of  the  injunctive \n25  relief,  as well as responding to defendants'  appeal of the judgment \nwill  involve  further  attorney  time  for  which  they  will  seek \n26  additional  compensation  in  the  future. \n2 \n\n1  figure,  the  product  of  the  number  of  hours  reasonably  spent  on \n2  litigation  by  a  reasonable  rate.  See  Hensley  v.  Eckerhart,  461 \n3  U.S.  424,  433  (1983);  Intel  Corp.  v.  Terabyte  Int'l,  Inc.,  6  F.3d \n4  614,  622  (9th  Cir.  1993).  A  fee  award  is  to  include  compensation \n5  of  paralegals  and  law  clerks.  See  Missouri  v.  Jenkins,  491  U.S. \n6  274,  284-285  (1989);  United Steelworker v.  Phelps Dodge  Corp.,  896 \n7  F.2d  403,  407-408  (9th  Cir.  1990).  Finally,  time  spent \n8  establishing  entitlement  to  an  award  of  attorneys  fees  under \n9  Section  1988  is generally compensable.  See  Guerra v.  Cummings,  70 \n10  F.3d  1111,  1113  (9th  Cir.  1995),  cert.  denied,  518  U.S.  1018 \n11  (1996). \n12  II. \n13  ANALYSIS \n14  A.  PREVAILING  PARTY \n15  Plaintiffs have  indisputably proven  \"an  actual  violation\"  of \n16  their  rights  protected  by  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and  RLUIPA,  and  are \n17  therefore  entitled to  an  award  of  attorney's  fees.  This  lengthy, \n18  complex class action suit has  involved multiple phases  and appeals \n19  in which the court  has granted plaintiffs various  forms  of  relief. \n20  After  lengthy  discovery,  the  parties  engaged  in  settlement \n21  discussions  from  which  all  issues  except  the  plaintiffs'  right  to \n22  attend Jumu'ah and wear beards were  settled.  During  the  course of \n23  this  action,  the  court  granted  plaintiffs  ten  preliminary \n24  injunctions  allowing  the  plaintiffs  to  attend  Jumu'ah  without \n25  penalty  and  five  preliminary  injunctions  allowing  plaintiffs  to \n26  wear  half-inch beards  without  penalty.  All  but  one  of  the \n3 \n\n1  injunctions  were  appealed  by  the  defendants.  Mayweathers  v. \n2  Newland,  258  F. 3d 930  (9th Cir.  2001);  Mayweathers v.  Newland,  314 \n3  F. 3d  1062  (9th  Cir.  2002),  cert.  denied,  Alameida  v.  Mayweathers, \n4  u.s.  124  S.Ct.  66  (2003).  The  court  further  ruled  in \n5  plaintiffs' favor in rejecting defendants'  constitutional challenge \n6  of  RLUIPA,  a  determination  that  was  upheld  by  the  Ninth  circuit, \n7  and  granting  permanent  injunctions  on  the  Jumu' ah  and  beard \n8  issues. 2  The  final  judgment  also  includes  a  court  order governing \n9  a  process for locating and expunging certain disciplinary documents \n10  from  current  and  past  plaintiffs'  custody  files  wherever  located \n11  throughout  the  state. \n12  B.  REASONABLE  HOURLY  RATE \n13  1.  Sue  Christian \n14  Christian  was  appointed  on  October  16,  1997  as  attorney  of \n15  record for all of  the plaintiffs when  she was  Supervising Attorney \n16  of  the  King  Hall  Civil  Rights  Clinic  (\"KHCRC\").  Christian Dec.  at \n17  ~  1.  After  leaving  the  KHCRC,  she  continued  to  represent \n18  plaintiffs while  employed  at  the  Law  Office  of  Stewart  Katz,  and \n19  then  at  the  Prison Law  Office,  where  she  remains  today.  Id.  at  ~~ \n20  2,7. 3 \n21 \n22  2  Defendants  have  appealed  the  judgment  and  a  subsequent \norder  governing  expungement  of  plaintiffs'  disciplinary  records. \n23 \n3  Christian asserts  that  some  of  her  representation was  done \n24  on  the  time  of  these  two  law  firms,  while  some  was  done  on  her \npersonal  time.  Id.  at  ~  7.  She  states  that  any  fee  awarded \n25  pursuant  to this motion will be  properly apportioned and disbursed \nto  the  KHCRC,  the  Katz  firm,  and  to  the  Prison  Law  Office, \n26  according  to  the  amount  of  work  performed  during  each  period. \n4 \n\n1  The  fee  for  work  performed  by  the  attorney  in  this  prisoner \n2  litigation is  limited  to  an  hourly  rate  no  \"greater  than  150 \n3  percent of the hourly rate established under section 3006A of Title \n4  18,  for  payment  of  court-appointed  counsel.u  42  U.S.C. \n5  §  1997e(d) (3).  Defendants  do  not  challenge  the  reasonableness  or \n6  extent  to  which  plaintiff  is  entitled to  attorney's  fees. \n7  Plaintiffs'  counsel  seeks,  and  defendants  stipulated to,  an  award \n8  of $112.50 per hour for work performed prior to January 1,  2002  and \n9  $169.50  per  hour  for  work  performed  thereafter.  Def's  Oppo.  to \n10  Pl's Mot.  for  Atty's  Fees  at  1. \n11  2.  Law  Students \n12  From the beginning of  the  litigation until Christian left the \n13  KHCRC  on June  30,  2001,  a  total of  34  law students certified by the \n14  court worked  on  this case.  Christian Dec.  at~ 4.  Plaintiffs seek \n15  compensation  at  $60.00  per  hour  for  law  students'  work. \n16  Christian  provides  sufficient  evidence  to  support  that  her \n17  requested  hourly  rate  is  reasonable.  Christian  Decl.,  Exh.  A. \n18  Under  Christian's  supervision,  the  students  worked  on  a  wide \n19  variety  of  tasks,  including  discovery,  taking  and  defending \n20  depositions,  legal  research  and  writing,  and  arguing  motions  in \n21  court.  Christian Dec.  at~ 4.  Because of  the nature of  the action \n22  and  the  issues  involved,  the  work  done  by  the  KHCRC  students  was \n23  more  complex  and  legally  sophisticated  than  work  typically \n24  performed  by  law  clerks  or paralegals  in  law  firms.  Accordingly, \n25  the hourly rate of  $60.00  for  student work  is fair and  reasonable. \n26  /Ill \n5 \n\nc. \n1  REASONABLENESS  OF  HOURS  BILLED \n2  Christian  submits  time  records,  kept  contemporaneously,  of \n3  attorney  and  student  hours  expended  in  this  case  from  October  of \n4  1997  to  late  June  of  2001.  Christian  Dec.,  Exh.  C.  The  records \n5  show  that  attorney hours  totaled 1,071,  and  student  hours  totaled \n6  2,870.  Christian  Dec.  at  ~  6.  The  plaintiff  only  seek  fees  for \n7  two-thirds  the  student  hours,  which  amount  to  1,913  hours.  Id. \n8  Christian  also  provides  detailed  time  records  maintained  for  her \n9  time  from  July  1,  2001  to  October  14,  2004.  Christian  Dec.,  Exh. \n10  D. \n11  Although  the  defendants  do  not  generally  challenge  the \n12  reasonableness  of  the  billed  hours,  they  assert  that  counsel \n13  miscalculated  the  fees  for  the  101.2  hours  of  personal  attorney \n14  time.  The  contention is not based upon the number of hours billed, \n15  but  the  rate  under  which  the  hours  were  calculated.  According  to \n16  the  defendants,  a  greater portion of  these  hours  should  have  been \n17  calculated  at  the  lesser  PLRA.  In  her  reply,  however,  Christian \n18  clarifies  that  the  allocation  and  calculation  of  hours  according \n19  to  the  two  PLRA  rates  are  correct.  She  points  out  that  she  spent \n20  80  hours  between November  29,  2001  and January 24,  2002  on writing \n21  the  brief  in opposition  to  defendants'  Ninth  Circuit  appeal \n22  regarding  the  constitutionality of  RLUIPA.  Because  that  time  was \n23  divided in half  for  the purpose of determining  the  applicable  PLRA \n24  rates,  40  hours  were  billed at  the  rate of  $112.50  and  40  hours  at \n25  $169.50.  See  Exh.  D,  pg.  2,  to  Christian Decl.  Accordingly,  the \n26  court  is  satisfied  that  plaintiffs'  counsel's  calculations  are \n6 \n\n1  correct. \n2  IV. \n3  CONCLUSION \n4  Accordingly,  plaintiffs'  counsel  is AWARDED  fees  of \n5  $289,011.00. 4 \n6  IT  IS  SO  ORDERED. \n7  DATED:  November  18,  2004. \n8 \n9  L \nSENIOR  JUD \n10  UNITED  STAT  DISTRICT \n11 \n12  4  The  amount  is based  on  the  fees  documented  by  plaintiffs' \ncounsel  as  follows: \n13 \nChristian: \n14  Dates  Hours  Rate  Total \n10/16/97  - 6/30/01  1,071  X  $112.50  $120,487.50 \n15  (KHCRC) \n16  7/1/01  - 2/1/02  28  X  $112.50  $  3,150.00 \n(Law  Office  of  Stewart  Katz) \n17 \n2/1/02  - 8/6/02  26  X  $169.50  $  4,407.00 \n18  (Law  Office  of  Stewart  Katz) \n19 \n10/11/01  - 2/1/02  61  X  $112.50  $  6,862.50 \n20  (personal  time) \n21  2/1/02  - 12/29/02  65  X  $169.50  $  11,017.50 \n(personal  time) \n22 \n1/10/03  - 10/14/04  167  X  $169.50  $  28,306.50 \n23  (Prison  Law  Office) \n24  Students: \n10/16/97  - 6/30/01  1,913  X  $60.00  $114,780.00 \n25 \nTOTAL  $289,011.00 \n26 \n7 \n\nndd \nUnited  States  District  Court \nfor  the \nEastern District  of  California \nNovember  19,  2004 \n*  *  CERTIFICATE  OF  SERVICE  *  * \n2:96-cv-01582 \nMayweathers \nv. \nSutton \nI,  the  undersigned,  hereby  certify that  I  am  an  employee  in  the  Office  of \nthe  Clerk,  U.S.  District  Court,  Eastern District  of  California. \nThat  on  November  19,  2004,  I  SERVED  a  true  and  correct  copy(ies}  of \nthe  attached,  by  placing  said copy(ies}  in a  postage  paid envelope \naddressed  to  the  person(s}  hereinafter  listed,  by  depositing  said \nenvelope  in  the  U.S.  Mail,  by  placing  said  copy(ies}  into  an  inter-office \ndelivery  receptacle  located  in  the  Clerk's  office,  or,  pursuant  to  prior \nauthorization by  counsel,  via  facsimile. \nSusan  Dee  Christian  AR/LKK \nPrison  Law  Office \nGeneral  Delivery  VC/GGH \nSan  Quentin,  CA  94964 \nTami  M Warwick \nAttorney  General's  Office  for  the  State  of  California \nPO  Box  944255 \n1300  I  Street \nSuite  125 \nSacramento,  CA  94244-2550 \nJohn  K Vincent \nUnited  States Attorney \n501  I  Street \nSuite  10-100 \nSacramento,  CA  95814 \nMarc  D  Stern \nNOT  EDCA  ADMITTED \nAmerican  Jewish  Congress \n15  East  84th  Street \nNew  York,  NY  10028  Jack L.

      "text": "Mayweathers v. Newland\nFILED\nPC-CA-016-001\nJUN - 5 2000\n2\n3 CLERK. U.S. DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF CAUFORNl'\nBY\n4\nDEPUTY CLERK\n5\n6\n7\n8 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n9 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n10 KARLUK MAYWEATHERS, et al.,\n11 Plaintiffs,  No. CIV S-96-1582 LKK JFM P\n12\nvs.\n13 CALVINE TERHUNE, et al.,\n14 Defendants.  ORDER\n15\n16 On May 25,2000 and June 2,2000 the parties by and through their counsel met in\n17 settlement conference.  Plaintiffs were represented by Susan Christian and Rikka Fountain;\n1$ defendants were represented by Jill Bowers. Also present for defendants were Warden A.C.\n19 Newland, Barry Smith (CDC Community Resources Officer - Coordinator of Religious\n20 Programs), Vimal Singh (Food Manager - CSP Solano), Michael Valdez (Community Resources\n21 Manager - CSP Solano).  After two days of settlement conference, the parties settled four\n22 substantive issues and agreed upon an accelerated litigation process for two issues which could\n23 not be settled.  This order memorializes and confirms the agreements reached.\n24 Muslim Chaplain\n25\nThe warden, CSP Solano, or other appropriate official, will announce within two\n26\nweeks that there will be a full-time Muslim Chaplain limited term position.  The person will be\n\nhired in the normal process; the hiring process will commence immediately after the\nannouncement.  It is contemplated that the Muslim Chaplain will be hired in approximately 90\ndays. The Legislature must thereafter authorize a full time Muslim Chaplain position.\nDefendants shall seek to input the request for a full time position in the Governor's proposed\n2001-2002 California State Budget.\nThe Muslim Chaplain is primarily responsible for ministering to persons of the\nMuslim religion.  However, plaintiffs understand that the Muslim Chaplain must be available as\nwell to minister to inmates of other religions.\n9 Religious Oils\n10 Muslims will be allowed to special order: 8oz per order of 100% extract non-\n11 alcoholic oil in clear plastic bottles (labeled contents) from an approved vendor.  This agreement\n12 is limited to CSP Solano, and is not to be interpreted as applying to other institutions. Misuse of\n13 the oil, e.g., hoarding, overstocking, selling oil to other inmates, using it to facilitate an offense,\n14 may subject the oil to forfeiture and the inmates involved to discipline.\nKuffis\n15\n16 The Muslim community will be permitted to wear kuffis (religious headgear) as\n17 described in the September 15,1997, Memorandum from A.C. Newland, Warden, to All Staff; in\n18 addition, the Muslim Community will be permitted to wear the religious headgear while in their\n19 cells; provided however, that religious headgear shall not be allowed in the common areas of any\n20 celled housing unit.  Religious headgear may be worn by Muslims housed in dormitories, but is\n21 restricted to the area proximate to their bunks, and during the performance of their five daily\n22 prayers (Salaatus Subh (Morning Prayer), Salaatuz Zuhr (Noon Prayer), Salaatul 'Asr (afternoon\n23 Prayer), Salaatul Maghrib (Evening Prayer); and Salatul \"Ishaa (Night prayer).\n24 \\\\\\\\\\\n25 \\\\\\\\\\\n26\n\nI Food\n2 Plaintiffs currently receive a religious diet card which authorizes an inmate\nholding the card to substitute non-meat items in place of meat selections.  CSP Solano Prison\nManagement will make best efforts to ensure that bases, seasoning and food additives used in\nmeat substitutes do not contain meat or meat by-products.  If an inmate requests that no gravy be\nplaced on his food (gravy generally contains meat products), this request shall be honored.\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, e.g., lockdowns, emergency situations, and the like, no\npeanut butter will be served three times a day as a meat substitute whether in sandwiches or in a\ncup.  Servings of peanut butter as a meat substitute will not be made more than four times a week\n10 for breakfast and dinner (combined), i.e., no more than two for breakfast and  no more than two\n11 for dinner.  For lunch, peanut butter will not be served as the main meal or substitute more than\n12 three times a week.  Based on standardized menus, best efforts will be made to introduce as\n13 much variety as possible into the substitute meals. At present, the meat substitutes are:\n14 Breakfast - eggs, cheese, peanut butter, extra scoops of another served item\n15 Lunch - peanut butter, boiled eggs or cheese\n16 Dinner - peanut butter, fish (fish is generally served to all inmates approximately seven times a\n17 quarter) (fish may be served as a substitute for holiday meals), cottage cheese (double scoop),\n18 seasoned beans, macaroni and cheese, potatoes au gratin, three bean salad.\n19 For two religious Muslim holidays, halaal meats will be served.\n20 The parties understand that different menu standardization requirements may be\n21 imposed in the future by CDC such that the above listed substitutes are not guaranteed to be\n22 available; however, if the CDC standardization is violative of the law, plaintiffs have not waived\n23 their rights by entering into this settlement to contest the standardization.\n24 Diet Cards Enforcement - best efforts will be made to check religious diet ID\n25 cards such that inmates not authorized to have the special diet meals will not take them; the\n26 Warden shall issue a memorandum to appropriate staff with this instruction.  Plaintiffs agree that\n\nthey will not \"double back,\" i.e., go into the line for a second diet meal, or give their diet cards to\nother inmates.\n3 Beards\n4 The Honorable John F. Moulds has entered Findings and Recommendations\n5 which find that a preliminary injunction requiring prison officials to permit plaintiffs to grow\none-half inch beards should not issue. The parties are willing to accelerate the ruling on\nobjections to the Findings to be made by the Honorable Lawrence K. Karlton into a final\njudgment.  With one exception, the present record on the preliminary injunction motion is the\nrecord upon which Judge Karlton's ruling will be made.  Without agreeing to the merits of the\n10 justification, the parties stipulate that the defendants may add the following as a justification for\n11 their no-beards policy to the extent that the record does not already reflect this justification:  that\n12 beards could be used as an identification or \"badge\" of a particular group to the detriment of\n13 institutional security and discipline.\n14 Judge Karlton remains free to direct the parties to produce additional testimony or\n15 documentary evidence if he believes such is necessary to the final ruling.\n16 Jumu 'ah\n17 Judge Moulds entered Findings and Recommendations which find that a\n18 preliminary injunction should be entered requiring prison officials to permit plaintiffs to use their\n19 ETO (excused time off) to attend Jumu'ah services on Friday at noontime.  The parties are again\n20 willing to accelerate the ruling on objections to be made by Judge Karlton into the final judgment\n21 based on the preliminary injunction record and the following additional evidence.  The court will\n22 hear testimony from Mr. Larson on the WIP (work incentive program) in connection .with use of\n23 ETO for religious purposes.  Moreover, this additional fact is stipulated:  an individual plaintiff\n24 could seek to change his job, class or shift to days or particular hours in order to be free to attend\n25 Jumu'ah services (as would any inmate to attend a particular religious service).\n26\n\nHowever, depending on the sought change in job, shift or class, there may be institutional delay\nto re-assignment.\nAgain, Judge Karlton remains free to direct the parties to produce additional\ntestimony or documentary evidence.\n5 Miscellaneous\n6 Plaintiffs agree to waive attorneys' fees.  However costs are to be finally\ndetermined at the district court level pursuant to the following formula.  Plaintiffs' costs will not\nexceed $14,000.  In the event that plaintiffs prevail at the district court level on both remaining\nissues (beards and Jumu'ah), plaintiffs will receive all costs. If plaintiffs prevail on one of the\n10 issues, plaintiffs will receive one-half their costs.  Defendants may seek costs if they prevail on\n11 both issues.  Further resolution of the remaining issues on appeal, even if contrary to the district\n12 court decision, will not affect the cost formula.\n13 Appellate fees and costs are not part of this settlement.\n14 The court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement; however,\n15 nothing in this settlement affects the legal status of judgments entered on the remaining issues, or\n16 the necessity that such judgments be based on the requirements of the Prisoner Litigation Reform\n17 Act.\n18 Settlement of the four substantive issues encompasses CSP Solano only, and does\n19 not stand as required precedent for other institutions.\n20 The trial set before Judge Moulds is hereby vacated.  The parties shall make\n21 arrangements with Judge Kariton's chambers concerning the submission of the Larson testimony.\n22 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n23 DATED:  June  O  , 2000.  \"*\"\n24\n25 TE JUDGE\nGGH:gh:O35\n26 maywl582.set",

I\ndecide the motion on the basis of the papers and pleadings filed herein and after oral argument.\nI.\nBACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs are a class of Muslim state prisoners housed at California State Prison-Solano seeking relief under the\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et seq., and under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, for alleged violations of their First Amendment right to the free exercise of their religion, as well as\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the law.\nEach of plaintiffs' alleged violations has either been addressed by a settlement agreement between the parties or\nis subject to a preliminary injunction that has been continued by stipulation pending the ruling on the instant\nmotion. The present motion seeks to make the stipulated injunctive relief permanent.\nThis court has issued fifteen preliminary injunctions in this case since July 31, 2001, with defendants\nunsuccessfully appealing all but one. Following the Ninth Circuit's decision to uphold RLUIPA and the Supreme\nCourt's denial of defendants' petition for certiorari, the parties stipulated to the continued operation of the\npreviously-ordered injunctive relief pending a final decision by this court. The relevant facts in this case have\nremained essentially unchanged throughout the course of this litigation and are set forth in detail in the previous\norders of this court and the Ninth Circuit.\n\nA. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nSeveral individual and group complaints were filed by the Muslim inmates at California State Prison at Solano in\n1995 and 1996. On October 16, 1997, the court appointed counsel for the plaintiffs. The actions were\nconsolidated and a class action was certified on November 19, 1998.\nOriginally, plaintiffs sought relief with respect to several claims reflecting a variety of requests for accommodation\nof the plaintiffs' practice of Islam. An order filed on June 5, 2000, memorialized and confirmed settlement\nagreements reached on all issues except plaintiffs' request to attend Jumu'ah services and to wear half-inch\nbeards without being disciplined or subjected to the loss of any sentence-reducing (\"work time\" or \"good time\")\ncredits to which they may otherwise be entitled.\nPlaintiffs' claims of violation of their religious freedom originally proceeded under the standards set forth in Turner\nv. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). The first three preliminary injunctions, all for\nJumu'ah attendance, were granted under the Turner standard and affirmed by the Ninth Circuit. Mayweathers v.\nNewland, 258 F.3d 930 (9th Cir.2001). Plaintiffs' original motion for preliminary injunction on the grooming issue\nwas denied under the Turner standard.\nIn September 2000, President Clinton signed the RLUIPA into law. Shortly thereafter, the court granted plaintiffs\nleave to amend in order to add a RLUIPA claim. Defendants moved to dismiss the RLUIPA claim, arguing that the\nstatute is unconstitutional. On July 2, 2001, this court found the act to be constitutional and denied defendants'\nmotion to dismiss.\n1089 Defendants appealed the order to the Ninth Circuit. As set forth below, defendants *1089 also appealed\npreliminary injunctions four through ten concerning Jumu'ah, and the first four of the five preliminary injunctions\nconcerning grooming. All of those appeals were based only on defendants' challenge to the constitutionality of\nRLUIPA. Consequently, all were either consolidated with the RLUIPA appeal or were stayed pending the outcome\nthereof. On December 27, 2002, the Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of RLUIPA and thereby affirmed the\n[1]\npreliminary injunctions. Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir.2002). Defendants' petition for\nrehearing en banc was denied. Defendants then filed a certiorari petition in the Supreme Court, which was also\ndenied. Alameida v. Mayweathers, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 66, 157 L.Ed.2d 30 (2003).\nB. JUMUA'AH ATTENDANCE\nCSP-Solano is a medium security prison about thirty-five miles southwest of Sacramento. The vast majority of\ninmates are enrolled in the prison's work incentive program, in which every day of participation may reduce their\nsentences by one day. Under the relevant prison regulations, all able-bodied prisoners, including plaintiffs, are\nrequired to work or attend class. Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3040(a). Plaintiffs' work or class assignments are\nmade by prison staff \"with or without the inmate's consent.\" Id. at § 3040(c) & (f).\nIf inmates miss work without the approval of their supervisors, they receive an unexcused absence, known as an\n\"A day,\" which can be grounds for discipline. Being late or \"absent without authorization from a work or program\nassignment\" is an \"administrative rule violation,\" id., at § 3314(a)(d)(H), and \"[r]efusal to perform work or\nparticipate in a program as ordered or assigned\" is a \"serious rule violation.\" Id. at § 3315(a)(3)(J). The\npunishment for such violations includes suspension of privileges, confinement to quarters, forfeiture of up to thirty\ndays of sentence credits, change in work incentive program eligibility, and transfer to a higher level prison. Id. at §\n3314(e), 3315(f), 3323(h), 3375.\nAccording to Muslim scholars and imams who have offered evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs, attendance at the\nFriday Sabbath services known as Jumu'ah is commanded by the Qur'an, and the services must be held\ncollectively under the leadership of an imam. See O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 345, 107 S.Ct.\n2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987) (\"Jumu'ah is commanded by the Koran and must be held every Friday after the sun\nreaches its zenith and before the Asr, or afternoon prayer.\"); Hamdani Depo. at 39:8-16. Plaintiffs assigned to\n\nwork or class on Friday are not allowed to leave their assignments to attend Jumu'ah. Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, §\n3041(b). Plaintiffs who leave their work or class assignments to attend Jumu'ah have been, and without injunctive\nrelief may in the future be, subjected to progressive discipline resulting in the imposition of numerous penalties\nand loss of privileges. 15 Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, §§ 3044, 3315(a)(3)(j), 3315(a)(3)(f); Matthews Depo. at\n103:4-105:9; Pennington Depo. at 15:6-17; Mayweathers Depo. at 76:9-19. Those plaintiffs who are entitled to\nearn sentence-reducing credits by working or going to class are denied those credits for each day that they leave\nfor an hour to attend Jumu'ah. Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3045.2; Garner Decl.\nPlaintiffs' first motion for preliminary injunction concerning Jumu'ah attendance was filed on October 21, 1999.\n1090 Plaintiffs requested to be allowed to attend Jumu'ah *1090 without being disciplined, which was clarified as\nincluding protection from receiving progressive discipline and from denial of sentence-reducing \"work time\" or\n\"good-time\" credits. By order of July 31, 2000, the court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations and\ngranted the first preliminary injunction concerning Jumu'ah.\nEvery preliminary injunction in this action was subject to the automatic 90- day expiration provision of the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). Plaintiffs have therefore filed numerous subsequent\nmotions for identical relief over the course of the litigation. Defendants' argument that such repeated motions are\nbarred by the PLRA was rejected by this court and affirmed by the Ninth Circuit. Mayweathers v. Terhune, 136\nF.Supp.2d 1152 (E.D.Cal.2001); aff'd, Mayweathers, 258 F.3d at 936.\nThis court issued a second preliminary injunction on December 19, 2000, prohibiting defendants from imposing\ndisciplinary action or the \"forfeiture\" of work time credits when plaintiffs attend Jumu'ah. After further briefing and\nadditional oral argument, the court denied plaintiffs' request for the relief to be expanded to include prohibiting\ndefendants from denying plaintiffs the opportunity to \"earn\" work time credits while they attend Jumu'ah. Plaintiffs'\nthird motion for preliminary injunction, still under Turner, was granted March 30, 2001. Defendants appealed each\nof the first three injunctions regarding Jumu'ah. On August 2, 2001, the Ninth Circuit affirmed each of the\ninjunctions. Mayweathers, 258 F.3d 930 (9th Cir.2001). The fourth motion for preliminary injunction was filed\nbased upon both Turner and RLUIPA and was granted on July 5, 2001. The court expanded the relief and\nordered as follows:\n[P]laintiffs are allowed to attend Jumu'ah services during the pendency of this action without\nreceiving disciplinary action, forfeiting good-time credits, or losing the opportunity to earn good-\ntime credits.\nOrder of July 5, 2001.\nAll subsequent orders by the court granted this same injunctive relief. The court issued these orders based on the\nlaw of the case doctrine, finding that defendants had failed each time to respond to plaintiffs' further Jumu'ah\nmotions with any new evidence or new legal argument that had not already been considered and rejected by the\ncourt. Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983). Defendants appealed each of\nthe fourth through tenth preliminary injunctions, challenging the constitutionality of RLUIPA in each appeal. All of\nthe appeals were consolidated into one challenge of RLUIPA and all were denied. Mayweathers, 314 F.3d 1062.\nThe Ninth Circuit's decision rejecting some appeals, and defendants' dismissal of others that had been stayed,\nresulted in affirmance of the fourth through tenth preliminary injunctions for Jumu'ah and the four grooming\nappeals.\nPending en banc review by the Ninth Circuit, and again following denial or certiorari by the Supreme Court, the\nparties stipulated to allow the Jumu'ah and grooming injunctive relief to continue without requiring the court to\nissue successive renewals under the PLRA. Defendants thus forfeited the opportunity to produce evidence in\nopposition to the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief. Thus, pursuant to court order, plaintiffs are currently being\nallowed to leave their assignments to attend Jumu'ah without being disciplined or being denied the opportunity to\nearn sentence-reducing credit.\n\nC. GROOMING POLICY\n1091 Plaintiffs have also challenged defendants' grooming policy. Wearing at least *1091 a half-inch beard is an\nexercise of plaintiffs' religion. Hamdani Depo. at 69:4-6; Hasan Decl. at ¶¶ 3, 6. CDC grooming regulations\nprohibit plaintiffs from wearing beards of any length for religious purposes. Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3062(h).\nPlaintiffs have worn beards for religious purposes and have been, and without injunctive relief may in the future\nbe, considered \"program failures\" and have been, and may be, subjected to progressive discipline. Cal.Code\nRegs., tit. 15, § 3062(m); Mayweathers Depo. at 14:3-15:19, 35:6-36:25, 81:7-88; Jihad Depo. at 68:18-69:18;\n99:2-100:3.\nPlaintiffs' original motion for preliminary injunction challenging defendants' grooming regulations was premised on\nthe Turner standard. The court denied that motion on July 31, 2000. On September 13, 2001, plaintiffs filed a new\nmotion for preliminary injunction to allow them to wear a half-inch beard, but this time they did so under RLUIPA.\nThat motion was granted on February 8, 2002. Defendants appealed the injunction, based only on a challenge to\nthe constitutionality of RLUIPA.\nAs with the Jumu'ah issue, plaintiffs filed subsequent motions for preliminary injunction on the grooming issue\nbecause each order expired automatically after 90 days. By order dated April 26, 2002, the court denied\ndefendants' motion to stay enforcement of the first grooming injunction and granted plaintiffs' motion to renew the\ninjunctive relief. Defendants appealed the second injunction, again challenging only the constitutionality of\nRLUIPA. Defendants appealed the third and fourth injunctions. The fifth grooming injunction was issued after the\nNinth Circuit affirmed the constitutionality of RLUIPA. Defendants did not appeal this injunction, but rather,\nstipulated to the maintenance of the grooming preliminary injunctive relief without the need for successive\nmotions pending their petition for rehearing en banc and their petition for certiorari. Once the petition for certiorari\nwas denied, they stipulated to allow the grooming relief to continue pending final judgment. As with the Jumu'ah\ninjunction, defendants continue to comply with the grooming injunction at this time.\nII.\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS UNDER FED. R. CIV. P. 56\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is demonstrated that there exists no genuine issue as to any material\nfact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); See also Adickes v.\nS.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); Sicor Limited v. Cetus Corp., 51 F.3d\n848, 853 (9th Cir.1995).\nUnder summary judgment practice, the moving party\nalways bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and\nidentifying those portions of \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\" which it believes demonstrate the absence\nof a genuine issue of material fact.\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). \"[W]here the nonmoving\nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue, a summary judgment motion may properly be\nmade in reliance solely on the `pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file.'\" Id.\nIndeed, summary judgment should be entered, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a\n1092 party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish *1092 the existence of an element essential to that\nparty's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. See id. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548. \"[A]\ncomplete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all\nother facts immaterial.\" Id. In such a circumstance, summary judgment should be granted, \"so long as whatever\nis before the district court demonstrates that the standard for entry of summary judgment, as set forth in Rule 56\n(c), is satisfied.\" Id. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\n\nIf the moving party meets its initial responsibility, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish that a\ngenuine issue as to any material fact actually does exist. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475\nU.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); See also First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391\nU.S. 253, 288-89, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968); Sicor Limited, 51 F.3d at 853.\nIn attempting to establish the existence of this factual dispute, the opposing party may not rely upon the denials\nof its pleadings, but is required to tender evidence of specific facts in the form of affidavits, and/or admissible\ndiscovery material, in support of its contention that the dispute exists. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586 n. 11, 106 S.Ct. 1348; See also First Nat'l Bank, 391 U.S. at 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575; Rand v. Rowland,\n154 F.3d 952, 954 (9th Cir.1998). The opposing party must demonstrate that the fact in contention is material,\ni.e., a fact that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Owens v. Local No. 169, Assoc. of Western Pulp and\nPaper Workers, 971 F.2d 347, 355 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n,\n809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987)), and that the dispute is genuine, i.e., the evidence is such that a reasonable\njury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505; see also Cline\nv. Industrial Maintenance Engineering & Contracting Co., 200 F.3d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir.2000).\nIn the endeavor to establish the existence of a factual dispute, the opposing party need not establish a material\nissue of fact conclusively in its favor. It is sufficient that \"the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or\njudge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial.\" First Nat'l Bank, 391 U.S. at 290, 88 S.Ct. 1575\n; See also T.W. Elec. Serv., 809 F.2d at 631. Thus, the \"purpose of summary judgment is to `pierce the pleadings\nand to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.'\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587,\n106 S.Ct. 1348 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) advisory committee's note on 1963 amendments); see also \nInternational Union of Bricklayers & Allied Craftsman Local Union No. 20 v. Martin Jaska, Inc., 752 F.2d 1401,\n1405 (9th Cir.1985).\nIn resolving the summary judgment motion, the court examines the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any. Rule 56(c); See also In re Citric Acid\nLitigation, 191 F.3d 1090, 1093 (9th Cir.1999). The evidence of the opposing party is to be believed, see \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts\nplaced before the court must be drawn in favor of the opposing party, see Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct.\n1348 (citing United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962) (per curiam)); \nSee also Headwaters Forest Defense v. County of Humboldt, 211 F.3d 1121, 1132 (9th Cir.2000). Nevertheless,\n1093 inferences are *1093 not drawn out of the air, and it is the opposing party's obligation to produce a factual\npredicate from which the inference may be drawn. See Richards v. Nielsen Freight Lines, 602 F.Supp. 1224,\n1244-45 (E.D.Cal.1985),aff'd,810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir.1987).\nFinally, to demonstrate a genuine issue, the opposing party \"must do more than simply show that there is some\nmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts.... Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of\nfact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no `genuine issue for trial.'\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct.\n1348 (citation omitted).\nIII.\nRLUIPA STANDARDS\nRLUIPA provides that \"[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person\nresiding in or confined to an institution ... even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the\ngovernment demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person ... is in furtherance of a compelling\ngovernmental interest [ ] and ... is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling interest.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n2000cc-1(a). The Act applies to any \"program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n2000cc-1(b)(1) and (2).\n\nTo assert a claim under RLUIPA, plaintiffs must produce \"prima facie evidence to support a claim alleging a\nviolation of the Free Exercise Clause....\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2(b). The government, however, \"shall bear the\nburden of persuasion on any element of the claim, except that plaintiff shall bear the burden of persuasion on\nwhether the law (including a regulation) or government practice that is challenged by the claim substantially\nburdens the plaintiff's exercise of religion.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2(b).\nRLUIPA further provides that it shall be \"construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the\nmaximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3(g).\nIn opposing plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction, defendants make a series of arguments that have\nconsistently been rejected during the course of this litigation. Indeed, each of defendants' contentions are\neffectively foreclosed by law of the case, either because of a previous ruling of this court, or the Ninth Circuit, or\nboth. Additionally, this court's recent decision on permanent injunctive relief in Fenelon v. Riddle, No. CIV-\nS-95-0954 LKK JFM, is virtually indistinguishable from the Jumu'ah claim at issue here.\nAs I explain below, defendants do make one new argument, and it is a serious one. Defendants contend that this\ncourt cannot grant injunctive relief which would expunge from plaintiffs' files any rules violation reports for\nattending Jumu'ah or failure to comply with grooming regulations. They argue that such relief, because it involves\nrelief that would affect the length of plaintiffs' sentence, can only be resolved through a writ of habeas corpus.\nBefore addressing this argument, I briefly touch on defendants' other contentions.\nIV.\nSTANDING/ADEQUACY OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVES\nFirst, defendants contend that the named class representatives may not seek injunctive relief because they have\nnot demonstrated a substantial burden on their religious exercise insofar as they have not been disciplined for\nfailure to comply with the challenged policies. Defendants' argument, though couched by defendants in terms of\n1094 the RLUIPA \"substantial *1094 burden\" requirement, is in effect an attack on plaintiffs' standing to bring their\nclaims. This court, however, has already addressed nearly identical arguments concerning the same named\nplaintiffs and has rejected them. See Order of March 30, 2001 at 6. As the court has previously explained,\ndefendants' argument speaks to the effectiveness of the court's preliminary injunction, not the justiciability of the\nplaintiffs' claim. See Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190, 120 S.Ct.\n693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (\"[I]t is plaintiffs' burden to establish standing by demonstrating that, if unchecked by\nthe litigation, the defendant's allegedly wrong behavior will likely occur or continue and that the threatened injury\nis certainly impending.\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs' uncontested proffer that they\nhad been prevented from attending Jumu'ah prior to the issuance of the injunction suffices to establish their\nstanding. The mere fact that the substituted class representatives, who were added as representatives after\npreliminary injunctive relief had been granted, have not been disciplined, does not suggest that they are\ninadequate as representatives. As the Ninth Circuit recently explained:\nThe named plaintiffs either face or have faced the choice between following work incentive\nprogram rules and obeying the Qur'an. Prison officials do not argue that the named plaintiffs are\nsomehow immune from having to work on Fridays in the future. The prisoners have standing to\nseek injunctive relief, and a holding to the contrary would allow prison officials to defeat prisoners'\nclaims simply by changing individual plaintiffs' work schedules as soon as they file suit.\nMayweathers v. Newland, 258 F.3d 930, 934-935 (9th Cir.2001). The same logic addresses defendants'\ncontention regarding discipline under the grooming regulations. As plaintiffs' reply brief explains in detail, the\ncourt has already found all three class representatives adequate to challenge both the grooming and Jumu'ah\npolicies, and defendants do not allege any permanent change in circumstances which would alter that\nconclusion.\n\nV.\nCOMPELLING INTEREST/LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS\nDefendants next raise a series of arguments seeking to justify the Jumu'ah and grooming policies as serving\ncompelling interests such as security within the prison. Again, as plaintiffs point out, both this court and the Ninth\nCircuit have foreclosed precisely the same arguments. For purposes of the record on appeal, the court will once\nagain briefly explain why defendants' arguments are not persuasive.\nA. GROOMING POLICY\nPlaintiffs assert that their religion requires that they wear beards. It is uncontested that inmates who refuse to\nshave their beards in conformity with CDC grooming regulations are subjected to progressive penalties,\nculminating in placement on \"C-Status,\" which prevents inmates from earning good-time credits. See Cal.Code\nRegs., tit. 15, §§ 3062(m) & 3315(f).\nDefendants assert that the grooming regulations are necessary to identify inmates for the purpose of preventing\nescapes and controlling movement within the prison. They have previously tendered evidence that the grooming\nregulations were implemented in response to a number of escapes from different institutions after inmates altered\ntheir appearances. See Anthony Newland Depo. at 39:15-40:13; 62:13-65:3; 64:6-65:3. Defendants also submit\n1095 that a beard of any length changes the appearance of a prisoner and compromises *1095 the process of\nidentifying inmates or escapees. Finally, defendants assert that correctional officers need to quickly identify\ninmates to prevent assaults, riots, or disturbances, and that without these amended regulations this process\nwould become impossible if an inmate quickly changed his appearance by shaving his beard.\nThroughout the course of this litigation, plaintiffs have responded to these arguments with evidence that the\nsafety and security concerns tendered by defendants are largely exaggerated, and do not justify the imposition of\ngrooming regulations prohibiting beards. Plaintiffs' expert, George Sullivan, who has more than forty years of\nexperience in corrections, stated in his affidavit that he was unaware of any instance where an inmate escaped\nfrom prison solely by changing his appearance. See George Sullivan Dec. at ¶¶ 3, 12. Sullivan opined that the\nincidents of escape cited by CDC officials were taken out of context, without acknowledgment of the additional\ncircumstances that permitted each escape. Id. Moreover, Sullivan averred that Section 3287(b) of the grooming\nregulation should alleviate defendants' concerns about identification since it requires \"visual daily inspections ...\nto ensure compliance with departmental grooming standards.\" See George Sullivan Decl. at 13 (citing Cal.Code.\nRegs., tit. 15, § 3287(b)).\nDefendants' rationale that an inmate with a beard can more easily alter his appearance after he escapes is not\npersuasive. Common sense and experience recognizes that a prisoner may not only shave, but alter his\nappearance in any number of ways to evade authorities after escape. Moreover, while it is plausible that altering\na six inch beard, or cutting very long hair may assist an escapee to elude capture, I must agree with Judge\nStrand that shaving a half-inch beard likely cannot. See Luckette v. Lewis, 883 F.Supp. 471, 481 (D.Ariz.1995)\n(\"prison officials do not meet their burden of demonstrating a compelling interest for not allowing a short, kempt\nbeard\"); Fromer v. Scully, 874 F.2d 69, 74 (2d Cir.1989) (\"[i]t is certainly not irrational to believe that a full beard,\nwhich may well extend for significant lengths sideways from the cheeks as well as downwards from the chin, may\nimpede identification more than a one-inch beard\"). As Magistrate Judge Moulds concluded \"[w]hen it comes to\nchanging one's appearance through the growth or removal of hair, this court finds that not all beards are equal.\" \nSee Findings and Recommendations, dated March 29, 2000, at 30:10-12.\nFinally, I note that the defendants are not faced with the specter of prisoners constantly changing their\nappearance. Surely an inmate who grows a beard for assertedly religious reasons and then shaves without\ncompulsion, provides evidence suggesting that the inmate does not have a legitimate religious conviction. See \nLuckette, 883 F.Supp. at 481. For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that the prison grooming policy\n\ndoes not further a compelling governmental interest, and is therefore in violation of RLUIPA. See 42 U.S.C. §\n2000cc-1(a).\nBecause I conclude above that the plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that the regulations are an\nexaggerated response to defendants' security concerns, it follows that defendants have not demonstrated that\nthe regulations are the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling governmental interest.\nAs explained above, the grooming regulations themselves provide one alternative. Section 3287(b) of Title 15 of\nthe California Code of Regulations requires mandatory visual daily inspections of inmates' facial hair. These\n1096 inspections should alleviate *1096 concerns about an inmate's ability to engender confusion by radical alterations\nin appearance. Nor does the concern that escapees may change their appearance require a different result.\nPrison officials can address the risk of an inmate avoiding detection by shaving his beard by requiring two\nphotographs of that inmate: one with his face clean shaven, and one with a half-inch beard. Luckette, 883\nF.Supp. at 481 (finding that photographing an inmate with a short beard may make it easier to differentiate that\ninmate from others without beards); see also Ross v. Coughlin, 669 F.Supp. 1235, 1240-41 (S.D.N.Y.1987)\n(upholding an \"initial shave\" requirement to obtain a photograph of inmates without a beard to later assist in their\nidentification if they shave their beards). Indeed, prior to the current grooming regulations, prison officials took\nadditional photos of inmates who altered their appearance during incarceration through the growth of hair. See\nFindings and Recommendations, dated March 29, 2000, at 32:1-5. Defendants produce no evidence that\nresuming this practice would result in a significant cost to the institution.\nBecause there appear to be ready alternatives to the prohibition of beards, defendants have not used the least\nrestrictive means of accomplishing its goals of prison security and easy identification of prisoners. See Ashelman\nv. Wawrzaszek, 111 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.1997)(\"the existence of alternatives may be evidence that the [policy]\nis not reasonable but is an `exaggerated response' to prison concerns.\")\nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the challenged grooming regulations, as they are applied to plaintiffs,\nviolate RLUIPA.\nB. JUMU'AH ATTENDANCE\nAs with the grooming policy, defendants repeat their previously-rejected arguments with respect to Jumu'ah\nattendance. They argue that, even if the prison's polices impose a substantial burden on plaintiffs' exercise of\nreligion, the defendants have a compelling interest in administering the Work Incentive Program because the\nprogram provides for safety and security in the prisons and prevents prison conditions from deteriorating. In\nparticular, defendants argue that the WIP program accomplishes these objectives by keeping inmates engaged in\nproductive, supervised activities and providing the prison with labor needed to prevent prison conditions from\ndeteriorating.\nIf this were a traditional Free Exercise Clause challenge, it is doubtful that these asserted justifications would be\nsufficient to withstand scrutiny under O'Lone and Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64\n(1987). See Mayweathers I, 258 F.3d at 937-38 (holding prison policy of punishing inmates for missing work to\nattend Jumu'ah services was not rationally related to a legitimate penological purpose under Turner); id. at 938.\n(\"As the discussion of the Turner factors shows, the inmates' likelihood of success on the merits is strong.\").\nUnder RLUIPA, however, defendants must meet an even higher standard. They must conclusively demonstrate\nthat the policy \"is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest [and] is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).\nIn Mayweathers I, the Ninth Circuit considered and rejected defendants' argument that the injunction in this case\nwould interfere with the government's interest in making sure that inmates attend their work and education\nassignments. See id. at 938. Although the court found this to be a \"legitimate interest\" under Turner, the court\nultimately found the justification insufficient because the injunction had not significantly altered the operation of\n1097 the *1097 prison's work program. The court found that the defendants had:\n\nutterly failed to show any ripple effect among inmates and staff from the narrow scope of the\ninjunction. Prison administrators have implemented the injunction by logging inmates' unexcused\nabsences as always; the only change is that unexcused absences attributable to Jumu'ah\nattendance are off bounds to the disciplinary process ... [T]he absence of Muslim inmates for\nabout one hour on Fridays only will not disrupt the operation of the work incentive program.\nId. Defendants have presented no evidence suggesting that the situation within the prison has changed since the\nNinth Circuit handed down its decision.\nEven assuming that defendants' asserted interests in keeping prisoners occupied and using their labor for prison\nupkeep were sufficiently compelling, however, defendants have not demonstrated that the challenged policy with\nrespect to Jumu'ah, in particular, is the least restrictive means to achieve those interests. Among the several\nreasonable alternatives suggested by plaintiff, the most obvious is the suggestion that the Warden grant a special\nexemption for attendance at Jumu'ah, such that missing work to attend Jumu'ah will not result in disciplinary\naction. Under the current regulations, some inmates may take as many as 16 hours off a month to receive\nvisitors, attend special services, and go to certain recreation and entertainment events. See Cal.Code Regs., tit.\n15, §§ 3045.2(b) & (e). Given the extensive set of secular exemptions to the prison work requirements, the policy\nof punishing inmates for one hour of weekly Jumu'ah attendance cannot be said to be the least restrictive means\nof achieving the state's asserted interest in instilling work ethic.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit's conclusion in Mayweathers I that the preliminary injunctive relief has caused only a\n\"slight change from routine prison practices,\" id. at 938, cannot be reconciled with the notion that very same\nrelief, if made permanent, would somehow result in serious disruption to the prison. For the foregoing reasons,\nthe court finds that the prison's policy with respect to Jumu'ah attendance is in violation of RLUIPA.\nVI.\nEXPUNGEMENT OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS\nFinally, defendants take issue with the third prong of plaintiffs' proposed injunctive relief, which reads as follows:\nDefendants shall remove from the custody files of all past and current members of the plaintiff\nclass, any and all documents reflecting disciplinary action or credit loss resulting from plaintiffs'\nattendance at Jumu'ah or from wearing beards for religious purposes.\nDefendants take issue with this proposed relief on two grounds. First, they argue that the proposed injunction\nwould violate the PLRA's standards for permanent injunctive relief. Second, they argue that the injunction would\nviolate the rule of Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because it\nwould have the effect of reducing the length of plaintiffs' sentences to the extent that the discipline in question\ninvolved the loss of credits. I address these arguments in turn.\nThe court may not grant prospective relief without making the specific findings required by the Prison Litigation\nReform Act (PLRA). See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1). The PLRA provides that \"[t]he court shall not grant or approve\nany prospective relief [with respect to prison conditions] unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn,\n1098 extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal *1098 right, and is the least intrusive\nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" Id.; see also Oluwa v. Gomez, 133 F.3d 1237,\n1239 (9th Cir.1998) (\"We interpret the statute to mean just what is says 00 before granting prospective injunctive\n97\nrelief, the trial court must make the findings mandated by the PLRA.\").\nUnder these standards, defendants raise two objections to the request. First, they argue that they are \"not\nrequired to expunge all disciplinary actions that occurred prior to the Court issuing Plaintiffs preliminary injunctive\nrelief and prior to RLUIPA.\" Second, they argue that \"there is no method by which Defendants can identify all the\npast and current members of the Plaintiff class to determine which records need to be expunged.\" Def's Oppo. at\n13.\n\nA. RETROACTIVE APPLICATION\nWith respect to retroactive effect, the statute is silent. Orafan v. Goord, 2003 WL 21972735 (N.D.N.Y. Aug 11,\n2003) (\"Unlike its predecessor, RLUIPA is silent as to its retroactive applicability.\"). In Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994), the Supreme Court explained the approach\ncourts should follow when determining the temporal application of new legislation. First, courts must begin with\nthe statutory language to ascertain whether Congress prescribed the statute's temporal reach. Id. at 280, 114\nS.Ct. 1483. If the statute is silent on such issue, as it is here, the court must then determine \"whether the new\nstatute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,\nincrease a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\"\nId. (quoted in St. Cyr v. I.N.S., 229 F.3d 406, 413 (2d Cir.2000)). If application of the statute would have such a\n\"retroactive effect,\" \"then, in keeping with our `traditional presumption' against retroactivity, we presume that the\nstatute does not apply to that conduct.\" Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 352, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 144 L.Ed.2d 347\n(1999) (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483); see also Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488\nU.S. 204, 208, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (judicial default rules dictate, absent statutory language or\nother legislative intent to the contrary retroactivity is not favored in the law) (cited in Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 264,\n114 S.Ct. 1483); St. Cyr v. I.N.S., 229 F.3d at 413; Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130, 168 (E.D.N.Y.1997).\nApplying these standards to RLUIPA, it is apparent that the statute is silent as to its temporal application and\nfurther, applying the statute retroactively would appear to attach new legal consequences with respect to past\nconduct. Pre-RLUIPA monetary damages, for instance, would clearly be precluded. It is less clear that these rules\naffect a request for injunctive relief, since the function of injunctive relief is directed to the future and not toward\nremediation of past wrongs. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 293, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (Scalia, J. concurring). For these\nreasons, prospective injunctive relief is ordinarily not considered retroactive, and courts have so held in the\ncontext of RLUIPA. See Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 960 n. 5 (10th Cir.2001)(holding that the application of\nRLUIPA was not retroactive where the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief); Dilaura v. Ann Arbor Charter Twp., 30\nFed.Appx. 501, 509 (6th Cir.2002) (\"Plaintiffs are seeking prospective relief [under RLUIPA] in the form of an\ninjunction ordering the township to allow them to run their retreat house. Injunctive relief is prospective, not\nretroactive.\"). Here, however, the requested relief is intended not merely to prospectively bar defendants from\nviolating plaintiffs' rights, but also to remedy past violations of plaintiffs' rights.\n1099 *1099 With respect to the beard policy, it can be said with confidence that relief would not have been available\nprior to the enactment of RLUIPA, since this court denied injunctive relief on that basis under the pre-RLUIPA \nTurner standard. With respect to the Jumu'ah policy, however, this court (and the Ninth Circuit) have already\nfound that injunctive relief would be proper under the Turner standard as well. Thus, at least as to that issue,\nrelief for wrongs predating RLUIPA would appear appropriate regardless of whether the statute has retroactive\neffect. This creates two regimes for disciplinary actions predating 2000: disciplinary actions due to Jumu'ah\nattendance are invalid, while disciplinary action due to contravention of the beards rule are not.\nB. ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN\nDefendants also raise a serious argument that it would be either difficult or impossible for them to locate all past\nand current members of the plaintiff class to determine which records need to be expunged. Unfortunately,\ndefendants provide no evidence of any asserted administrative burden apart from the bald suggestion that it\nwould be difficult to locate members of the plaintiff class, making it difficult for the court to devise an appropriate\nremedy that respects both the needs of the prison administrators and those of the plaintiffs.\nUnder the PLRA, the court must specifically find that the relief afforded extends no further than necessary to\ncorrect the threat to plaintiffs' rights under RLUIPA and, accordingly, that it is narrowly drawn and the least\nintrusive means necessary to correct the harm. Accordingly, the court will order the parties to propose an\nappropriate means of implementing the expungement of plaintiffs' disciplinary records.\n\nVII.\nHABEAS EXHAUSTION RULE\nFinally, defendants object to the disciplinary expungement relief on the grounds that the proposed injunction, to\nthe extent that it concerns the loss of credits that would affect the length of plaintiffs' sentences, may be\naccomplished only through a writ of habeas corpus. Defendants rely on Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 114\nS.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and its predecessor case, Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct.\n1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), in which the Supreme Court addressed the relationship between 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nand the habeas statutes, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2254. Preiser, 411 U.S. at 482, 93 S.Ct. 1827; Heck, 512 U.S.\nat 480, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (\"This case lies at the intersection of two of the most fertile sources of federal-court\nprisoner litigation [§ 1983] and [the federal habeas corpus statutes]\"). No court has yet considered the application\nof the Heck-Preiser rule to RLUIPA.\nA. Preiser v. Rodriguez\nIn Preiser, the plaintiffs were state prisoners who were deprived of good-time credits as a result of disciplinary\nproceedings and who brought suit under section 1983 alleging that prison officials had acted unconstitutionally in\ndepriving them of the credits. 411 U.S. at 476, 93 S.Ct. 1827. The Court considered the potential overlap\nbetween section 1983 and the habeas statutes in such cases and held that habeas corpus provided the exclusive\nremedy for a state prisoner who challenged the fact or duration of his confinement and sought immediate or\nspeedier release, even though his claim may otherwise come within the literal terms of § 1983.\n1100 The Preiser Court rejected the prisoners' claim that the broad language of section *1100 1983, which concededly\nencompassed their claims, should decide the issue:\nThe broad language of § 1983, however, is not conclusive of the issue before us. The statute is a\ngeneral one, and, despite the literal applicability of its terms, the question remains whether the\nspecific federal habeas corpus statute, explicitly and historically designed to provide the means for\na state prisoner to attack the validity of his confinement, must be understood to be the exclusive\nremedy available in a situation like this where it so clearly applies.\n411 U.S. at 489, 93 S.Ct. 1827. Thus, the Court's reasoning hinged on the distinction between the generality of\nsection 1983 and the specificity of the federal habeas statutes in addressing a means for attacking the validity of\nconfinement.\nNext, the Court observed that, in amending the habeas corpus law in 1948, Congress had imposed a\nrequirement that prisoners exhaust all adequate state remedies as a precondition to invoking federal judicial\nrelief. \"It would wholly frustrate explicit congressional intent,\" the Court explained, \"to hold that the respondents in\nthe present case could evade this requirement by the simple expedient of putting a different label on their\npleadings. In short, Congress has determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners\nattacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement, and that specific determination must override the\ngeneral terms of § 1983.\" Id. at 489-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827. Again, the court's reasoning relied on the distinction\nbetween the specific requirement of habeas exhaustion taking precedence over section 1983's general terms. \nSee411 U.S. at 489, 93 S.Ct. 1827 (\"It was conceded [at oral argument] that [a state prisoner] cannot bring a §\n1983 action, even though the literal terms of § 1983 might seem to cover such a challenge, because Congress\nhas passed a more specific act to cover that situation, and, in doing so, has provided that a state prisoner\nchallenging his conviction must first seek relief in a state forum, if a state remedy is available.\" (emphasis\nadded)).\nFinally, the Court explained that policy considerations, particularly the need for federal-state comity in a situation\nin which federal courts are asked to review the actions of state officials and state courts, furthered the need to\ngive full effect to the exhaustion requirement. Id. at 491-497, 93 S.Ct. 1827.\n\nB. Heck v. Humphrey\nIn Heck, the Court revisited the same territory, addressing \"the question whether a state prisoner may challenge\nthe constitutionality of his conviction in a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\" 481 U.S. at 478, 107 S.Ct.\n1862. That question, the Court maintained, was \"clearly not covered by the holding of Preiser, for petitioner seeks\nnot immediate or speedier release, but monetary damages, as to which he could not have sought and obtained\nfully effective relief through federal habeas corpus proceedings.\" Id. at 481, 93 S.Ct. 1827. Heck reaffirmed the\nrule of Preiser and extended it even to claims for which habeas cannot provide relief, but which nevertheless call\ninto question the validity of a conviction.\nThe starting point of Heck was the well-established principle that section 1983 \"creates a species of tort liability,\" \nId. at 483, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (citing Memphis Community Sch. Dist v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 305, 106 S.Ct. 2537,\n91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986)), and that the common law of torts provides rules regarding the \"elements of damages\nand the prerequisites for their recovery\" which provide a backdrop for 1983 actions. \"Thus,\" the Court explained,\n\"to determine whether there is any bar to the present suit, we look first to the common law of torts.\" Id. at 483, \n1101 114 S.Ct. *1101 2364. The Court then analogized the sort of section 1983 claim involved to a malicious\nprosecution claim, which, at common law, required the plaintiff to establish as an element of the tort that the prior\ncriminal proceeding terminated in favor of the accused. This requirement avoids parallel litigation over the same\nissues and prevents a criminal defendant from making a collateral attack on his or her conviction through a civil\nsuit. Reasoning that the same need for finality and consistency inheres in civil rights suits, the Court concluded\nthat the final termination requirement was equally applicable to section 1983 actions. Id. at 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364\n(\"We think the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of\noutstanding criminal judgments applies to § 1983 damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove\nthe unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement, just as it has always applied to actions for malicious\nprosecution.\").\nC. APPLICATION OF PREISER-HECK RULE TO RLUIPA\nThe court must consider what bearing the holdings of Preiser and Heck, both developed in connection with the\ninteraction between section 1983 and habeas corpus, have in the context of an action alleging violations of\nRLUIPA, the correction of which may impact the length or duration of a plaintiff's confinement. As I now explain,\ndefendants' argument that Heck bars the relief sought fails because of crucial differences between RLUIPA and\nsection 1983.\nFirst, plaintiffs' suit is brought under a specific Congressional enactment, RLUIPA, designed to redress the harms\nthat result from preventing prison inmates from exercising their religion. The statute's legislative history indicates\nthat it was enacted to prevent correctional institutions from restricting \"religious liberty in egregious and\nunnecessary ways.\" 146 Cong. Rec. S7774-01 (July 27, 2000) (Joint Statement of Senators Hatch and\nKennedy). The statute endows federal courts with broad remedial powers to correct such harms, and provides\nthat the \"Act shall be construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent\npermitted by the terms of this Act and the Constitution.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3(g).\nAs explained above, the dichotomy between the broad sweep of the section 1983 statute and the specific scope\nof the habeas statutes was central to the Court's reasoning in Preiser. Preiser held that the specific remedy of\nhabeas corpus was the appropriate vehicle for attacking the validity of the fact or length of confinement and that\n\"that specific determination must override the general terms of § 1983.\" 411 U.S. at 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827. Here,\nhowever, the situation is reversed: RLUIPA addresses a much more specific problem than the habeas statutes\nand, within that specific area, erects no exhaustion barrier and gives courts the power to remedy wrongs.\nSecond, to the extent that both Preiser and Heck are based on a comparison between habeas and the general\ntort regime of section 1983, the comparison is inapplicable here. In particular, Heck's analogy between section\n1983 actions and common law malicious prosecution claims simply has nothing to do with a claim under a\n\nspecific modern civil rights statute designed to apply in the prison context. This fact alone makes clear that Heck\nis irrelevant to today's decision.\nFinally, had Congress intended for habeas exhaustion requirements to limit relief under RLUIPA, Congress could\nsurely have so indicated. The federal courts need not import such a requirement and, indeed, must especially\n1102 decline to do *1102 so given RLUIPA's command that the Act \"be construed in favor of a broad protection of\nreligious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act and the Constitution.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n2000cc-3(g). Confronted with the choice between a specific Congressional enactment and a judge-made rule that\nmight be read to conflict with the statute, a federal court is bound to follow the clear intent of Congress. See Nev.\nDep't of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 1977, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003). Indeed, in the\ncontext of religious exercise, the Court has invited the political branches to provide greater protection for religious\nexercise through legislation. See Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 890, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d\n876 (1990); Madison v. Riter, 355 F.3d 310, 314-15 (4th Cir.2003). As Senator Kennedy, one of RLUIPA's\nsponsors, explained, RLUIPA \"reflects our commitment to protect religious freedom and our belief that Congress\nstill has the power to enact legislation to enhance that freedom, even after the Supreme Court's decision in 1997\nthat struck down the broader [RFRA].\" 146 Cong. Rec. S7774-01 (July 27, 2000).\nHeck, Preiser, and their progeny, therefore, do not preclude the relief requested by plaintiffs here.\nVIII.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court hereby ORDERS as follows:\n1. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and permanent injunction is GRANTED.\n2. Defendants are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED as follows:\na. Defendants may not impose any form of discipline on the plaintiffs, or cause them to forfeit or be denied the\nopportunity to earn sentence-reducing credits, based on plaintiffs' attendance at Jumu'ah services.\nb. Defendants may not impose any form of discipline on plaintiffs for wearing half-inch beards for religious\npurposes.\n3. The court specifically finds that foregoing the relief afforded extends no further than necessary to correct the\nthreat to plaintiffs' rights under RLUIPA and, accordingly, that it is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means\nnecessary to correct the harm. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1).\n4. The parties are ORDERED to MEET AND CONFER concerning the appropriate means of locating and\nexpunging plaintiffs' disciplinary records in accordance with the principles outlined in this order and consistent\nwith 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1). The parties SHALL FILE a joint proposed order addressing this issue not later than\nthirty (30) days from the effective date of this order. Should the parties fail to reach agreement on the matter, the\nparties SHALL FILE separate proposed orders not later than thirty (30) days from the effective date of this order.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] The appeals stayed pending the outcome of the main appeal were subsequently dismissed by the defendants,\nwith no further challenge to the relief granted by this court.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

California.\nApril 5, 2001.\n1153 *1153 Susan Christian, Davis, CA, for Plaintiffs.\nTami Warwick, Deputy Attorney General, California Department of Justice, Sacramento, CA, for Defendants.\nORDER\nKARLTON, Senior District Judge.\nPlaintiffs are a class of Muslim state prisoners housed at California State Prison, Solano seeking relief under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 for alleged violations of their First Amendment right to the free exercise of their religion, as well as\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the law. This matter comes before the court on their\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. I decide these motions based on the papers and pleadings filed herein and\n[1]\nafter oral argument.\nI.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn July 31, 2000, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction barring defendants from\n[2]\nenforcing their policy governing Jumu'ah attendance.  Specifically, this court held that plaintiffs are allowed \"to\nattend Jumu'ah services during the pendency of this action without receiving disciplinary action or forfeiting good-\ntime credits.\" Order dated July 31, 2000 at 5:15-17. The preliminary injunction expired by operation of law on\nNovember 31, 2000. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) (\"Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the\ndate that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the\nentry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.\") On December\n19, 2000, the court granted plaintiffs' second motion for a preliminary injunction on identical grounds. See Order\ndated December 19, 2000 at 17:8-10. That order expired by operation of law on March 19, 2001. See 18 U.S.C. §\n3626(a)(2).\nII.\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nPlaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction identical to the two previously entered by this court. They argue that\nthe court may summarily reenter a preliminary injunction based upon the principles of law of the case.\n\n1154 The law of the case doctrine requires that when a court decides on a rule, *1154 it should ordinarily follow that\nrule during the pendency of the matter. See Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318\n(1983). It is, of course, merely a prudential doctrine; nonetheless, the doctrine guides the court's discretion on\nissues such as the one at bar. See Slotkin v. Citizens Cas. Co., 614 F.2d 301, 312 (2d Cir.1979) (The law of the\ncase \"does not constitute a limitation on the court's power but merely expresses the general practice of refusing\nto reopen what has been decided.\") \"The rule of practice promotes finality and efficiency of the judicial process by\nprotecting against the agitation of settled issues....\" Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800,\n816, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Grounds justifying\ndeparture from the law of the case include substantially different evidence, a change in controlling authority or the\nneed to correct a clearly erroneous decision which would work a manifest injustice. See White v. Murtha, 377\nF.2d 428, 431-432 (5th Cir.1967).\nAll of the defendants' contentions were previously argued and rejected when the court issued the first and second\npreliminary injunction. The court now affirms its prior rejection of these arguments because the defendants have\nfailed to identify substantially different evidence, a change in the controlling legal authority, or any error in the\ncourt's prior decision. See id. Nonetheless, the court believes a brief further discussion is warranted of\ndefendants' persistent insistence that successive injunctions renders 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) nugatory. Put\ndirectly, as I explain below, the assertion is without merit.\nAs I have previously noted, the statute in its plain terms simply does not address the issue of successive\ninjunctions. Nor do successive injunctions render the expiration ordered by the statute without substance. On the\ncontrary, the process requires periodic reconsideration of the propriety of continued interim relief, placing the\nburden on plaintiff to justify a successive injunction.\nThe fact that in the instant case the plaintiffs have been able to rely on the doctrine of the law of the case to\njustify continued relief in no way counters the effect of the statute noted above. That reliance simply reflects that\nthe record is unchanged and continues to reflect that plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the\nmerits and threatened imminent irreparable injury. Moreover, if defendants had not appealed this court's previous\norder, the matter would likely have been put to trial and a final order entered, one way or another. Surely the\nstatute cannot be read so as to permit defendants to frustrate the accomplishment of an early resolution and then\ndemand to be free of the injunction by virtue thereof.\nFinally, I note that if carried to its logical conclusion defendants' position would bar successive suits, as well as\nsuccessive interim relief. Such a reading is implausible, as rather than amending 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in prison\nconditions cases, it would have the effect of partially repealing it, a holding contrary to the canon of construction\ndisfavoring repeal by implication. See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1017, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81\nL.Ed.2d 815 (1984) (citations omitted).\nBased on the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES defendants' contention that plaintiffs cannot seek a\npreliminary injunction to protect their right to attend Jumu'ah.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] By a separately filed non-published order, I resolve the remaining issues raised in the defendants' opposition\nto plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. See Kouba v. Allstate Ins. Co., 523 F.Supp. 148, 151, n. 2. (1981),\nrev'd on other grounds,691 F.2d 873 (9th Cir.1982).\n[2] Jumu'ah is a special prayer service enjoined upon Muslims.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

NELSON, Circuit Judge:\nCalifornia State Prison administrators appeal a preliminary injunction granted and later renewed by the district\ncourt in a class action brought by Muslim inmates at California State Prison, Solano (\"Solano\"). The injunctions\nforbade prison administrators from disciplining inmates for missing work to attend hour-long Friday Sabbath\nservices called Jumu'ah. We affirm.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nSolano is a medium security prison about thirty-five miles southwest of Sacramento. Nearly 4,500 inmates out of\na total of about 5,800 are enrolled in the prison's work incentive program, in which every day of participation may\nreduce their sentences by one day. Inmates serving life sentences cannot receive sentence reduction credits but\nstill participate in the program. Prison administrators assign inmates to appropriate programs \"with or without the\ninmate's consent.\" Cal. Admin. Code tit. 15, §§ 3040(c) & (f) (2001).\nIf inmates miss work without the approval of their supervisors, they receive an unexcused absence, known as an\n\"A day,\" which can be grounds for discipline. Being late or \"absent without authorization from a work or program\nassignment\" is an \"administrative rule violation,\" id. at § 3314(a)(3)(H), and \"[r]efusal to perform work or\nparticipate in a program as ordered or assigned\" is a \"serious rule violation.\" Id. at § 3315(a)(3)(J). The\npunishment for such violations includes suspension of privileges, confinement to quarters, forfeiture of up to thirty\ndays of sentence credits, change in work incentive program eligibility, and transfer to a higher level prison. Id. at\n§§ 3314(e), 3315(f), 3323(h), 3375.\nThe plaintiff class in the present case is comprised of Muslim inmates at Solano. The plaintiffs allege that the\nwork incentive program rules inhibit the free exercise of religion because missing work to attend Jumu'ah\nservices may be grounds for discipline. According to witnesses for the plaintiffs, attendance at these services is\ncommanded by the Qur'an, and these services differ from daily prayer in that they must be held collectively under\nthe leadership of an Imam. Cf. O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 345, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282\n(1987). One of the named plaintiffs, Terrance Mathews, currently has a Friday work assignment and has received\nunexcused absences for attending Jumu'ah. None of the others currently has a Friday work or education\n\nassignment, but in the past, all have either missed Jumu'ah because of work or have received unexcused\nabsences for leaving work to attend services.\nOn September 3, 1996, the plaintiffs filed suit in the Eastern District of California, seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive relief on a number of issues regarding the treatment of Muslim inmates. The only issue relevant in the\npresent appeal involves Jumu'ah services. The district court certified the class action on November 19, 1998, and\nallowed the plaintiffs to file a fifth amended complaint on January 28, 2000. On March 29, 2000, a magistrate\n934 judge entered findings and recommendations in *934 support of a preliminary injunction to allow inmates \"to\nattend Jumu'ah services during the pendency of this action without receiving disciplinary action or forfeiting good-\ntime credits.\" The district court adopted the magistrate's recommendations in an order filed on July 31, 2000.\nAfter the injunction was entered, Solano's warden ordered that prison officials must still record unexcused\nabsences for inmates who leave work for Jumu'ah but that such absences would not subject those inmates to\ndiscipline. The defendants timely filed an interlocutory appeal of the first injunction.\nThe district court held that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") mandated that the preliminary injunction\nexpire on October 29, 2000. Nevertheless, the court entered an identical preliminary injunction on December 19,\n2000. Again, the defendants filed a timely interlocutory appeal. On March 2, 2001, this panel consolidated the two\n[1]\nappeals.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\"We reverse the grant of a preliminary injunction only when the district court abused its discretion or based its\ndecision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.\" Sony Computer Entertainment\nv. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596, 602 (9th Cir.2000) (quotations omitted). Standing is a question of law reviewed\nde novo. Stewart v. Thorpe Holding Co. Profit Sharing Plan, 207 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.2000). The district\ncourt's exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo. Natural Resources Defense Council v.\nSouthwest Marine Inc., 242 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2001). The district court's interpretation of the PLRA is\nreviewed de novo. Page v. Torrey, 201 F.3d 1136, 1138 (9th Cir.2000).\nDISCUSSION\nI. PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nAppellants argue that the representative plaintiffs lack standing to bring this suit. In order to have standing,\nplaintiffs must allege \"actual or imminent harm\"; \"merely the status of being subject to a governmental institution\nthat was not organized or managed properly\" does not raise a prisoner's claim to the level of a case or\ncontroversy. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 350, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). In Lewis, the Supreme\nCourt held that inmates in Arizona prisons did not have standing by virtue of being prisoners to bring suit alleging\nthat inadequate libraries deprived them of meaningful access to the courts. Rather, to satisfy standing\nrequirements, an inmate must \"demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library ... hindered his efforts to\npursue a legal claim.\" Id. at 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174.\nThe plaintiffs in the present case have standing not merely because they are Muslim prisoners. Rather, one\nnamed plaintiff currently has a Friday work assignment and has received unexcused absences for attending\nJumu'ah services. The other plaintiffs testified that they have either received unexcused absences for missing\nwork to attend Jumu'ah services or have missed services for fear of facing disciplinary proceedings. Although the\nothers do not presently work on Fridays, prison officials retain the power to change their assignments back to\nones that conflict with the Muslim Sabbath. See Cal. Admin. Code tit. 15, § 3040. The named plaintiffs either face\n935 or have faced the choice between following work incentive program rules and obeying the Qur'an. *935 Prison\nofficials do not argue that the named plaintiffs are somehow immune from having to work on Fridays in the future.\nThe prisoners have standing to seek injunctive relief, and a holding to the contrary would allow prison officials to\ndefeat prisoners' claims simply by changing individual plaintiffs' work schedules as soon as they file suit.\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT HAD JURISDICTION TO ENTER A SECOND\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION WHILE THE FIRST ONE WAS BEING\nAPPEALED\nWhen a notice of appeal is filed, jurisdiction over the matters being appealed normally transfers from the district\ncourt to the appeals court. See Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 379, 105\nS.Ct. 1327, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985) (\"In general, filing of a notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of\nappeals and divests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\"). An\nexception exists under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, however, that allows the district court to retain\njurisdiction to \"suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal ... as it\nconsiders proper for the security of the rights of the adverse party.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(c). Appellants challenge the\ndistrict court's jurisdiction to grant a second injunction pending an interlocutory appeal of the first.\n\"The district court retains jurisdiction during the pendency of an appeal to act to preserve the status quo.\" Natural\nResources Defense Council Inc. v. Southwest Marine Inc., 242 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).\nRule 62(c) \"`does not restore jurisdiction to the district court to adjudicate anew the merits of the case.'\" Id.\n(quoting McClatchy Newspapers v. Central Valley Typographical Union No. 46, 686 F.2d 731, 734 (9th Cir.1982)).\nThe district court's exercise of jurisdiction should not \"materially alter the status of the case on appeal.\" Id.\n(citation omitted).\nThe district court in the present case neither changed the status quo at the time of the first appeal nor materially\naltered the status of the appeal. The defendants argue that the district court enlarged the injunction by ordering\nbriefing on whether to expand it, but this argument is moot because the district court refused to expand the\ninjunction in an order dated March 7, 2001. The defendants further argue that any district court action during the\npendency of the first appeal had to be designed to preserve their rights because by the terms of Rule 62(c), they\nwere the \"adverse party.\" The defendants assert this argument without any citations to case law, and it is\nmeritless. The plain language of Rule 62(c) allows the district court to \"suspend, modify, restore, or grant an\ninjunction\" during the pendency of the defendant's interlocutory appeal, and such action can inure to the benefit\nof plaintiffs or defendants. In Southwest Marine, for example, the district court granted an injunction against the\ndefendant in a citizen suit brought under the Clean Water Act but stayed key enforcement provisions. During the\npendency of the appeal, however, the district court lifted the stay and made the provisions more onerous. \nSouthwest Marine, 242 F.3d at 1165. Even though the district court's action worked against a defendant who had\nnot been subject to the injunction's provisions at the time of appeal, the modifications of the injunction were held\nto be in conformity with Rule 62(c). Id. at 1167. By contrast, the present case involves defendants who were\nsubject to an injunction at the time of appeal, and the renewed injunction was identical to the original one. In\n936 addition, both injunctions have already *936 expired, so the district court in no way introduced issues that could\nnot be addressed by this court on appeal. See McClatchy Newspapers, 686 F.2d at 732-33, 735 (holding that the\ndistrict court's expansion of an injunction was beyond the scope of Rule 62(c) because reversing the injunction at\nissue in the interlocutory appeal would not undo the new terms of the injunction). The district court's entry of the\nsecond injunction fell within Rule 62(c).\nIII. THE PLRA MANDATES THE EXPIRATION OF THE PRELIMINARY\nINJUNCTIONS 90 DAYS AFTER ENTRY, BUT THE DISTRICT COURT\nMAY ENTER A NEW INJUNCTION\nIn the first interlocutory appeal, the defendants sought a ruling that the preliminary injunction expired after 90\ndays because pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2), the district court did not make the requisite factual findings and\ndid not make the order final. In the second interlocutory appeal, the defendants argue that the same paragraph of\nthe PLRA governing the expiration of injunctive relief forbids the district court from entering a new preliminary\ninjunction after one expires. The statute provides the following:\n\nPreliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after its entry,\nunless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective\nrelief [that \"such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation\nof the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation\"] and\nmakes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.\n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). Because the district court in the present case did not make either of the preliminary\ninjunctions at issue final within 90 days, both injunctions expired pursuant to this provision.\nThe district court did not, however, violate the terms of the statute by entering the second injunction after the first\none expired. Nothing in the statute limits the number of times a court may enter preliminary relief. If anything, the\nprovision simply imposes a burden on plaintiffs to continue to prove that preliminary relief is warranted. The\nimposition of this burden conforms with how the PLRA governs the termination of final prospective relief. See 18\nU.S.C. § 3626(b) (providing for the termination of final injunctions by motion of a party unless \"the court makes\nwritten findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing\nviolation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and\nthat the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation\"). Therefore, the\ndistrict court's entry of the second preliminary injunction did not violate the PLRA.\nIV. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY\nENTERING THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FORBIDDING PRISON\nOFFICIALS FROM PUNISHING INMATES WHO ATTEND JUMU'AH\nSERVICES\nThe defendants make several arguments that the district court abused its discretion by enjoining them from\npunishing inmates who miss work to attend Jumu'ah services. First, the defendants contend that the injunction\nestablishes Islam as the preferred religion at Solano. This argument is meritless. If the government banned all\nSabbath services for all religions, and members of a single faith happened to be the only plaintiffs to file a lawsuit\nto enjoin the ban, their claim is not defeated because other faiths have failed to pursue as aggressive a litigation\nstrategy.\n937 *937 Second, the defendants argue that the PLRA \"limits the district court's authority to order prison\nadministrators to violate State law to ... final prospective relief.\" That limitation simply does not exist in 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626.\nThird, the defendants argue that O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282\n(1987), compels a finding that the prison policies inhibiting Jumu'ah attendance do not impermissibly interfere\nwith the free exercise of religion. O'Lone involved a prison program that assigned prisoners of a certain security\nclassification to work details outside the prison. Because of serious security risks involving prisoners' avoidance\nof work and attempts to return to the prison, the Supreme Court upheld a prison directive prohibiting inmates\nassigned to outside work detail from returning to the prison, except in the case of emergency. Inmates who\nwanted to return to the prison for Jumu'ah services sued. Id. at 346-47, 107 S.Ct. 2400. The Court upheld the\ndirective in part because Muslim inmates could participate in other religious observances. Id. at 351-52, 107 S.Ct.\n2400.\nNevertheless, the basic facts of O'Lone are distinguishable from the present case. The work program in O'Lone\ninvolved numerous assignments outside the prison, and in order to attend Jumu'ah services, Muslim inmates\nwould have to be reassigned to preferential jobs. Reorganizing work assignments that were closely tailored to\nsecurity classifications and giving Muslim inmates preference risked having a serious effect on security and the\noperation of the work incentive program. Id. at 345-47, 352-53, 107 S.Ct. 2400.\nThe present case, by contrast, involves relief that does not change the operation of the work incentive program at\nSolano. Rather, the preliminary injunction continues the status quo system of giving inmates \"A days\" for\n\nunexcused absences; the only change is that an \"A day\" for Jumu'ah attendance is not grounds for discipline.\nThe ability of inmates to participate in other religious observances was but one factor that weighed in favor of the\nprison administrators in O'Lone. It was not dispositive in O'Lone nor is it in the present case, and the existence of\nalternative avenues of religious expression at Solano will be considered below in the proper context of whether\nthe prison rules were rationally related to a legitimate penological purpose.\nFourth, the defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by citing the observation in O'Lone that\nthe Qur'an commands Jumu'ah attendance. The Court in O'Lone made an accurate citation to the Qur'an in\nsupport of this position, O'Lone, 482 U.S. at 345, 107 S.Ct. 2400, and the district court in the present case can\nhardly be faulted for correctly noting the importance of Jumu'ah.\nFifth, the defendants argue that the district court failed to defer to an assessment by prison administrators that\nthe work incentive program rules were rationally related to a legitimate penological purpose. In order to rule on\nthis issue, we must consider the four factors discussed in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254,\n96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), for determining whether a prison regulation that impinges on inmates' constitutional rights\nis \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Id. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254. Under Turner, (1) \"there must\nbe a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward\nto justify it\"; (2) where \"there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates ...\ncourts should be particularly conscious of the measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials in\n938 gauging the validity *938 of the regulation\"; (3) if \"accommodation of an asserted right will have a significant\nripple effect on fellow inmates or on prison staff, courts should be particularly deferential to the informed\ndiscretion of corrections officials\"; and (4) the absence of \"ready alternatives\" to a particular prison regulation is\nevidence that it is reasonable and not \"an exaggerated response to prison concerns.\" Id. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct.\n2254 (citations and internal quotations omitted).\nAt issue in the present case is whether the prison policy of punishing inmates for missing work to attend Jumu'ah\nservices is rationally related to a legitimate penological purpose. Under the first Turner factor, the government has\na legitimate interest in making sure inmates attend their work and education assignments, and punishing\nunexcused absences is validly connected to the goal of high attendance. Under the second factor, although there\nis no substitute for attending Jumu'ah services, the absence of alternatives does not require a holding in favor of\nthe inmates because they \"retain the ability to participate in other Muslim religious ceremonies.\" O'Lone, 482 U.S.\nat 352. The third and fourth factors, however, weigh solidly in favor of the inmates. The defendants have utterly\nfailed to show any ripple effect among inmates and staff from the narrow scope of the injunction. Prison\nadministrators have implemented the injunction by logging inmates' unexcused absences as always; the only\nchange is that unexcused absences attributable to Jumu'ah attendance are off bounds to the disciplinary\nprocess. Unlike O'Lone, this remedy does not require that Muslims receive preferential work assignments, and\nthe absence of Muslim inmates for about one hour on Fridays only will not disrupt the operation of the work\nincentive program. The lack of a ripple effect from the remedy devised by the district court is evidenced by the\nfact that some inmates may take as many as 16 hours off a month to receive visitors, attend special religious\nservices, and go to certain recreation and entertainment events. See Cal. Admin. Code tit. 15, §§ 3045.2(b) & (e).\nThe excused time off policy also suggests that the fact that inmates of other religions may attempt to attend their\nown Sabbath services in no way constitutes a significant disruption of the operation of the prison; additionally,\ngiven that the strength of the Muslim inmates' claim is derived from the fact that Jumu'ah attendance is compelled\nby the Qur'an, it is not clear that many non-Muslim inmates will have successful claims. The district court's\nnarrowly tailored injunction is proof that ready alternatives to the prison regulations exist and that the unexcused\nabsence policy under attack in the present case is not rationally related to a legitimate penological purpose.\nFinally, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to meet the traditional equitable criteria for granting a\npreliminary injunction. These criteria are \"(1) a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the possibility of\nirreparable injury to the plaintiffs if injunctive relief is not granted; (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiffs;\nand (4) advancement of the public interest.\" Textile Unltd., Inc. v. A.BMH & Co., Inc., 240 F.3d 781, 786 (9th\nCir.2001). As the discussion of the Turner factors shows, the inmates' likelihood of success on the merits is\nstrong. Additionally, as the district court ably noted, the inmates suffer irreparable injury when they are unable to\nattend religious services that are commanded by the Qur'an. The remedy imposed by the district court is such a\nslight change from routine prison practices that the balance of hardships weighs well in favor of the inmates. And\n\nthe free exercise of religion in prisons is obviously in the public interest. The equitable criteria for granting a\n939 preliminary injunction support *939 the district court's actions in the present case.\nCONCLUSION\nTherefore, the district court's grant and renewal of the preliminary injunctions are AFFIRMED.\n[1] On April 5, 2001, the district court entered a third identical injunction. See Mayweathers v. Terhune, 136\nF.Supp.2d 1152 (E.D.Cal. 2001).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The court affirms its prior rejection\nof these contentions because the defendants have failed to\nidentify substantially different evidence, a change in the\ncontrolling legal authority, or any error in the court's prior\ndecision.  See id. !\nDefendants also advance one new argument.  Defendants\n10 submit that the Ninth Circuits recent decision in Fenelon v.\n11 Riddle, CV 95-00954  (9th Cir. Feb. 7, 2002), supports the\nconclusion that the requested injunction violates the Prison\n13 Litigation Reform Act  (\"PLRA\").  I cannot agree.\n14 In Fenelon, plaintiff asserted that Jumu'ah is a\n15 permissible ground for ETO under the Department's regulations\n16 and that defendants' contrary practice violates those\n17 regulations.  See Order, dated May 1, 2000, at 7:4-6.  In the\n18 alternative, plaintiff attacked the Department's ETO regulations\n19 and CMF's Jumu'ah policy as infringements on his constitutional\n20 rights to free exercise, free speech, free association and equal\n21\n22 1  Defendants again argue that plaintiffs have not shown that\nthe CDC regulations impose a substantial burden on their religious\n23 freedoms, that defendants have a compelling interest in the\nadministration and goals of the Work Incentive Program, that the\n24 prison's policies and regulations are the least restrictive means\nof accomplishing those goals, and that plaintiffs cannot\n25 demonstrate irreparable injury.  These arguments were rejected by\nboth this court and the Ninth Circuit.  See Mayweathers v. Newland,\n26 258 F.3d 930, 936-39  (9th Cir. 2001).\n\nId-'db P1HK db, #54127 PAGE: 5/7\nprotection.  Id. at 7:6-9.  The court never reached the merits\nof plaintiff's constitutional challenge because it concluded\nthat Jumu'ah was a special religious function.  Id. at 18:17-18.\nThe Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded Fenelon finding\nthat the court's reading of Jumu'ah as a special religious\nfunction was \"strained,\" and determined that the injunction was\nentered without specific findings required by the PLRA.  Fenelon\nv. Riddle, CV 95-00954  (9th Cir. Feb. 7, 2002).  The Circuit\nalso instructed the court to consider the impact of the\n1C intervening changes in the law including RLUIPA.\n11 In the matter at bar, this court did not avoid the\n12 constitutional issue raised by plaintiff s challenge to the CDC\n13 regulations.  Rather, the court concluded that \"defendants\n14 disciplining of plaintiffs for attending Jumu'ah may amount to a\n15 violation of their right to the free exercise of religion under\n16 the First Amendment.\"  See Order, dated March 30, 2001, at 5 n.\n17 4.  Indeed, the court: followed the command of Congress and\n18 \"issued its original injunction in general terms in an effort to\n19 avoid intrusion into the management of the prison.\"  See Order,\n20 dated December 19, 2000, at 14:16-18; 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2).\n21 The court only expanded the preliminary injunction to prohibit\n22 defendants from denying them the opportunity to earn good time\n23 credits because of their observation of Jumu'ah when it\n24 concluded that plaintiff's RLUIPA claim \"significantly\n25 increase[d] their likelihood of success on the merits.\"  See\n26 Order, dated July 5, 2001 at 5:16-17, 13:8-12.

CHAVEZ,\n19 Defendants.\n20\n21 Plaintiffs are a class of Muslim state prisoners housed an\n22 California Szate Prison-Solano seeking relief under 42 U.S.C.\n23 § 1983 for alleged violations of their First Amendment right to\n24 the free exercise of their religion, as well as their Fourteenth\n25 Amendment right to equal protection of the law.  This matter\n26 comes before the court on their motion for a ninth preliminary\n\nstr MHbt.:\ninjunction.  The standards for such a motion are well-known and\nneed not be repeated here.  See Topanca Press Inc. v. City of\nLos Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524, 1528  (9th Cir. 1993).\nPlaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction identical to\nthat which the court has previously ordered.  They argue that\nthe court may summarily reenter a preliminary injunction based\nupon the principles of the law of the case.\nThe law of the case doctrine requires that when a court\ndecides on a rule, it should ordinarily follow that rule during\n10 the pendency of the case.  See Arizona v. California, 460 U.S.\n11 605, 618  (1983).  It is, of course, merely a prudential\n12 doctrine; nonetheless, the doctrine guides the court's\n13 discretion on issues such as the one at bar.  See Slotkin v.\n14 Citizens Cas. Co., 614 F.2d 301, 312  (2d Cir. 1979)  (The law of\n15 the case \"does not constitute a limitation on the court's power\n16 but merely expresses the general practice of refusing to reopen\n17 what has been decided.\")  \"The rule of practice promotes\n18 finality and efficiency of the judicial process by  ^protecting\n19 against the agitation of settled issues . . . .'\"  Christianson\n20 v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816  (1988).\n21 Grounds justifying departure from the law of the case\n22 include substantially different evidence, a change in\n23 controlling authority or the need to correct a clearly erroneous\n24 decision which would work a manifest injustice.  See White v.\n25 Murtha, 377 F.2d 428, 431-432  (5th Cir. 1967).\n26\n\nDefendants' contentions were previously argued and rejected\nwhen the court issued the first and second preliminary\ninjunctions and in the court's order denying defendants' motion\nto-dismiss plaintiffs' RLUIPA claim.  Moreover, the Ninth\nCircuit subsequently affirmed the merits of those injunctions,\nand the court's issuance of successive injunctions, in\nMavweathers v. Newland, 258 F.3d 930 (9th Cir. 2001).\nAccordingly, the court affirms its prior rejection of these\ncontentions because the defendants have failed to identify\n10  substantially different evidence, a change in the controlling\n11  legal authority, or any error in the court's prior decisions.\n12  See id.\n13  For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs' motion for a ninth\n14  preliminary injunction is GRANTED.\n15  IT IS SO ORDERED.\n16  DATED:  September 12, 2002.\n17\nr^^>\n18\n^L^WRENCE X.

CHAVEZ,\n19 Defendants.\n20\n21 Plaintiffs  are a class of Muslim state prisoners housed at\n22 California State Prison, Solano seeking relief under 42 U.S.C.\n23 § 1983 for alleged violations of their First Amendment right to the\n24 free  exercise  of  their  religion,  as  well  as  their  Fourteenth\n25 Amendment right to Equal Protection of the law.  This matter comes\n26 before  the  court  on their motions  for leave  to file an amended\n\n1 complaint, for a preliminary injunction, and for an order finding\n2 defendants in contempt of the preliminary injunction issued on July\n3 31, 2000.  I decide these motions based on the papers and pleadings\n4 filed herein and after oral argument.\n5 I.\n6 PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n7 Plaintiffs'  remaining  claims  attack  the policies  governing\n8 beards and Jumu'ah attendance at California State Prison, Solano.1\n9 On  July  31,  2000,  the  court  granted  plaintiffs'  motion  for  a\n10 preliminary  injunction  with  respect  to  Jumu'ah  attendance  and\n11 denied their motion with respect to the defendants' prohibition of\n12 beards.  Specifically, this court held that plaintiffs are allowed\n13 \"to attend  Jumu'ah  services  during  the pendency  of this  action\n14 without  receiving  disciplinary  action  or  forfeiting  good-time\n15 credits.\"  Order dated July 31, 2000 at 5:15-17.  The preliminary\n16 injunction has since expired by operation of law.  See 18 O.S.C.\n17 § 3626 (a) (2)  (\"Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically\n18 expire  on the date that is 90 days after its entry, unless  the\n19 court makes the findings required under subsection  (a)(1) for the\n20 entry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the\n21 expiration of the 90-day period.\")\n22\n23\n24\n1  The parties have reached a tentative settlement concerning\n25\nthe bulk of plaintiffs' case.  Class notice has been published on\nthese matters and the parties anticipate filing a motion for\n26\napproval of class settlement pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (a) .\n\n12=11  DEC  19.\n1 II.\n2 LEAVE TO AMEND\n3 A.  STANDARDS\n4 The Federal Rules provide that leave to amend pleadings\n5 \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"  Fed. R. Civ.\n6 P. 15 (a) .2  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, however,\n7 demonstrating that justice requires amendment \"becomes\nprogressively more difficult  . ..  as litigation proceeds toward\n8\ntrial.\"  Byrd v. Guess, 137 F.3d 1126, 1131  (9th Cir.), cert.\n9\n10 denied,  U.S.  , 119 S.Ct. 405  (1998).  Thus, subsequent to a\n11 scheduling order prohibiting further amendment, the moving party\n12 must demonstrate \"good cause.\"  Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations,\nInc., 975 F.2d 604, 608  (9th Cir. 1992).  Once a final pretrial\n13\norder has been entered, \"modifications are allowed  'only to\n14\nprevent manifest injustice.'\"  Byrd, 137 F.2d at 1331-32  (citing\n15\nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(e) ) .\n16\n17 Although the standard becomes progressively more stringent\n18 as the litigation proceeds, the Circuit has explained that the\n19 same four factors are pertinent to resolution of a motion to\n20 amend:  (1) the degree of prejudice or surprise to the non-\n21 moving party if the order is modified;  (2) the ability of the\n22 non-moving party to cure any prejudice;  (3) the impact of the\n23\n24 2  The entire text of the rule reads:\n25 \"a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of\ncourt or by written consent of the adverse party; and\n26 leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"\n\n#£4490  PAGE: 5/19\n1  modification on the orderly and efficient conduct of the case;\n2  and  M)  any degree of willfulness or bad faith on the part of\n3  the party seeking the modification.  See Byrd, 137 F.3d at 1132\n4  (citing United States v. First Nat'l Bank of Circle, 652 F.2d\n5  882, 887  (9th Cir. 1981)).  The burden is on the moving party to\n6  show that consideration of these factors warrants amendment.\n7  See id.\n8  Prejudice to the opposing party is the most important\n9  factor to consider in determining whether a party should be\n10  granted leave to amend.  See Jackson v. Bank of Hawaii. 902 F.2d\n11  1385, 1387  (9th Cir. 1990) (citing Zenith Radio Corp. v.\n12  Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 320, 330-31  (1971)).\n13  Prejudice may be found where additional discovery would be\n14  required because the new claims are based on different legal\n15  theories.  See Jackson, 902 F.2d at 1387-88  (citing Priddy v.\n16  Edelman, 883 F.2d 438, 447  (6th Cir. 1989)).\n17  While delay alone is insufficient to deny amendment, undue\n18  delay is a factor to be considered.  See Moronqo Band of Mission\n19  Indians v. Rose, 893 F.2d  1074, 1079  (9th Cir.  1990)(affirming\n20  district court's denial of motion for leave to amend to add new\n21  claims made two years into litigation).  Pertinent to\n22  consideration of this factor is whether the moving party knew or\n23  should have known the facts and theories raised by the amendment\n24  in the original pleading.  See Jackson, 902 F.2d at 1388  (citing\n25  E.E.Q.C. v. Boeing Co., 843 F.2d  1213, 1222  (9th Cir.), cert.\n26  denied, 488 U.S. 889  (1988)).\n\n1 Amendment may also be denied when it is futile.  See Kiser\n2 v. General Electric Corp., 831 F.2d 423, 428  (3d Cir. 1987),\n3 cert, denied, 485 U.S. 906  (1988).  The test for futility \"is\n4 identical to the one used when considering the sufficiency of a\n5 pleading challenged under Rule 12(b)(6).\"  Miller v. Rykoff-\n6 Sexton, Inc., 845 F.2d 209, 214  (9th Cir. 1988)(citing Baker v.\n7 Pacific Far East Lines, Inc., 451 F. Supp. 84, 89  (N.D. Cal.\n8 1978)).  Accordingly, \"a proposed amendment is futile only if no\n9 set of facts can be proved under the amendment to the pleading\n10 that would constitute a valid and sufficient claim or defense.\"\nIcL.\n11\n12 B.  PLAINTIFFS' MOTION\n13 Plaintiffs move for leave to amend their complaint\n14 challenging the defendants' rules concerning Jumu'ah attendance\n15 and grooming to add a claim under the Religious Land Use and\n16 Institutionalized  Persons Act of 2000  (\"RLUIPA\"), codified as\n17 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et sea.3  Defendants respond that the\n18 amendment is futile because plaintiffs' failure to exhaust the\n19 administrative remedies on their RLUIPA claim deprives this\n20 court of subject matter jurisdiction.  gee 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)\n21 (\"No  action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions\n22\nThe Act provides, inter alia, that \"[n]o government shall\n23\nimpose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person\nresiding in or confined to an institution . . . even if the burden\n24 results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government\ndemonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person . ..  is\n25 in furtherance of a compelling governmental  interest  . . . [and]\n. . . is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n26 governmental interest.\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc ( a) (1) -(2) .\n\nULL: iy,\n1  under section  1983  . . . until such administrative  remedies as\n2  are available are exhausted.\")  Two questions are tendered by\n3  defendants' opposition: first, whether plaintiffs' exhaustion is\n4  jurisdictional; second, even if not jurisdictional  should\n5  plaintiffs be required to exhaust.  As I now explain, the answer\n6  to both questions is no.\n7  A statute requiring exhaustion of administrative  remedies\n8  may be jurisdictional  if it is \"more than a codified  requirement\n9  of administrative exhaustion\" and contains \"sweeping and direct'\n10  statutory language that goes beyond a requirement that only\n11  exhausted action be brought.  Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749,\n12  757  (1975).  It is established that § 1997e(a) is not\n13  jurisdictional, but rather expresses a prudential  consideration\n14  that governs the timing of federal-court  decision making.  See\n15  Rumbles v. Hill, 182 F.3d  1064, 1067  (9th Cir. 1999); Lacev v.\n16  CSP Solano Medical Staff, 990 F. Supp. 1199  (E.D. Cal. 1997)\n17  (same).  Given that the issue of exhaustion is not\n18  jurisdictional, the court now turns to a consideration  of\n19  whether plaintiffs  should, nevertheless, be required to exhaust\n20  administrative  remedies prior to seeking relief in federal\n21  court.'\n22\n23\n24  4  \"[E]xhaustion  is  'a rule of judicial  administration,'\n. . and unless Congress directs otherwise, rightfully subject to\n25  crafting  by  judges.\"  Patsv  v. Board  of Regents  of  Florida,  457\nU.S.  496, 518  (1982), quoted in McCarthy v. Madiqan, 503 U.S. 140,\n26  144  (1992).\n\n1 Exhaustion \"serves the twin purposes of protecting\n2 administrative agency authority and promoting judicial\n3 efficiency.\"  McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  The first of these\n4 purposes reflects Congressional delegation of authority to\n5 coordinate branches of government and the notion that agencies\n6 have primary responsibility for programs that Congress has\n7 charged them to administer.  See id.  This same purpose is\n8 served by allowing an agency to apply its special expertise in\n9 an area and by allowing the agency \"to correct its own mistakes\n10 with respect to the program dt administers\" before subjecting it\n11 to litigation.  Id.5  The second purpose, that of judicial\n12 efficiency, is served by an administrative process that will\n13 correct agency mistakes, focus the dispute, and produce a useful\n14 record for subsequent judicial consideration in those cases not\n15 rendered moot by the administrative process.  See id.\n16 Plaintiffs argue that they substantially fulfilled this\n17 goal when they exhausted their claims for Jumu'ah attendance and\n18 grooming restrictions, albeit without reference to RLUIPA.\n19 Although that record does not address all of the considerations\n20 under the less deferential RLUIPA standard, it does provide the\n21 court with a substantial record.  Insofar as the defendants\n22\n23\ns  This principle appears to have little relevance here.  In\nenacting the PLRA, Congress did not establish a grievance procedure\n24\nor an administrative agency charged with authority in the area.\nIndeed, Congress has provided that a State's failure \"to adopt or\n25\nadhere to an administrative grievance procedure shall not\nconstitute the basis for an action\" under § 1997e.  42 U.S.C.\n26\n§ 1997e(b).\n7\n\n#^4490  PflGE: 9/19\n1 anticipate challenging the constitutionality of RLUIPA, the\n2 administrative record will not necessarily make the process more\nefficient.6\n4 Moreover, there is good reason not to require the\n5 plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies.\n6 Specifically, administrative exhaustion is not required where \"a\n7 particular plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm if unable to\n8 secure immediate judicial consideration of his claim  . . . .\"\n9 McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 147 {citations omitted).  In the matter at\n10 bar, the administrative process is lengthy and there is a\n11 congressional bias towards speedy disposition of this class of\n12 cases.  Moreover, the restriction on the duration of preliminary\n13 injunctions causes a burden on the ability of the court to\n14 efficiently protect the plaintiffs' constitutional rights\n15 pending the administrative proceeding.  Each of the above\n16 considerations counsel against requiring exhaustion.\n17 Accordingly, I conclude that exhaustion should not be required.\n18 The defendants also argue that they will be prejudiced\n19 because of the additional discovery the RLUIPA claim will\n20 require.  Additional discovery is the most important factor to\n21 be considered in determining whether the defendant is unduly\n22 prejudiced.  See Jackson, 902 F.2d at 1387.  Despite the fact\n23 that the RLUIPA presents the court with a different standard of\n24\n25\n°  Pending appropriate motion practice, the court  expresses\nno opinion on defendants' suggestion that RLUIPA is\n26\nunconstituLioiicil .\n8\n\n1  review over the plaintiffs' claims, the substance of their\n2  claims remains the same.  Indeed, it is not clear to the court\n3  what additional discovery  (other than perhaps contention\n4  interrogatories) the introduction of a new legal standard would\n5  require on the part of the defense.  Thus, the degree of\n6  prejudice, if any, is not great enough to deny plaintiffs the\n7  opportunity to amend their complaint.  See Byrd, 137 F.3d at\n1132  {citing United States v. First Nat'l Bank of Circle, 652\n9  F.2d  882, 887  (9th Cir. 1981\n10  III.\n11  PRELIMINARY  INJUNCTION\n12  Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction identical to\n13  the one previously entered by this court.  They argue that the\n14  court may reenter a preliminary injunction based upon the\n15  principles of issue and claim preclusion.  I conclude below\n16  that, although plaintiffs' motion does not implicate the\n17  doctrines of issue and claim preclusion, disposition is guided\n18  by the doctrine of law of the case.\n19  Obviously, this court can take judicial notice of its prior\n20  decision as well as the basis for that decision.  See United\n21  States v. Wilson, 631 F.2d  118, 119  (9th Cir. 1980) .\n22  Nonetheless, plaintiffs' two grounds cannot support a new\n23\n1  Nor do the final two considerations outlined in Bvrd, 137\nF.3d  1126, persuade  the court that plaintiffs'  request  to amend\nshould be denied.  Although plaintiffs' modification will\nultimately delay trial, the RLUIPA is a new law and thus plaintiffs\nare seeking the amendment in good faith.\n\n#24490  PAGE: 11/19\n1  injunction.\n2  Res judicata, or claim preclusion, applies only to a final\n3  judgment, see G & C Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, 241 U.S. 22, 28\n4  (1916), which is defined as \"one which ends the litigation on\n5  the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute\n6  the judgment.\"  Coopers & Librand v. Livesav 437 U.S. 463, 467\n7  (1978).  Collateral estoppel or issue preclusion similarly\n8  requires a final judgment, see SEC v. Ridenour, 913 F.2d 515,\n9  518  (8th Cir. 1993), and applies to decisions in prior\n10  litigation.  See Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222, 232  (1994) .\n11  Because the court's grant of a preliminary injunction arose in\n12  the instant litigation and was not a final decision, it does not\n13  implicate cither of these doctrines.\n14  The law of the case doctrine, on the other hand, requires\n15  that when a court decides on a rule, it should ordinarily follow\n16  that rule during the pendency of the case.  See Arizona v.\n17  California, 460 U.S. 605  (1983).  It is, of course, merely a\n18  prudential doctrine; nonetheless, the doctrine guides the\n19  court's discretion on issues such as the one at bar.\n20  See Slotkin v. Citizens Cas. Co., 614 F.2d 301, 312  (1979)  (The\n21  law of the case \"does not constitute a limitation on the court's\n22  power but merely expresses the general practice of refusing :o\n23  reopen what has been decided.\")  \"The rule of practice promotes\no4  finality and efficiency of the judicial process by  'protecting\n25  against the agitation of settled issues . . . .'\"  Christiansen\n26  v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816  (1988).\n10\n\n12:15 DEC 19, 2000\n1 Grounds justifying departure from the law of the case\n2 include substantially different evidence, a change in\n3 controlling authority or the need to correct a clearly erroneous\n4 decision which would work a manifest injustice.  See White v.\n5 Murtha. 377 F.2d 428, 431-432  (5th Cir. 1967).\n6 Several of the defendants' arguments were previously argued\n7 and rejected when the court granted plaintiffs' first\n8 preliminary injunction.  For a second time, defendants argue\n9 that plaintiffs lack standing and that the preliminary\n10 injunction violates the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\n11 The court affirms its prior rejection of these contentions\n12 because the defendants have failed to identify substantially\n13 different evidence, a change in the controlling legal authority,\n14 or any error in the court's prior decision.  See id.\n15 Defendants also advance several new arguments.  First,\n16 defendants contend that the' court lacks jurisdiction to grant a\n17 preliminary injunction.  Next, they argue that the Prison\n18 Litigation Reform Act bars the court from issuing a preliminary\n19 injunction.  I address their arguments seriatim.\n20 Defendants argue that their pending appeal of the July 31\n21 preliminary injunction leaves this court without jurisdiction to\n22 consider plaintiffs' current motion for a preliminary\n23 injunction.  Setting aside whether the expiration of the\n24 injunction noted above renders their appeal moot, the argument\n25 does not lie.\n26\n11\n\n±z>, cwov  #24490  PAGE: 13/19\nAlthough it is true that the \"filing of an appeal generally\ndivests the district court of jurisdiction over the matters\nappealed[,]\" Davis v. United States. 667 F.2d 822, 824  (9th Cir.\n1982), \"[w]hen an appeal is taken from an interlocutory  . . .\njudgment granting  . . . an injunction, the court in its\ndiscretion may  . . . grant an injunction during the pendency of\nthe appeal  . . . .\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 62 (c).8\nDefendants also argue that 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) prohibits\nthis court from issuing a preliminary injunction.  Although that\n10  statute places a limitation on the duration of an order granting\n11  preliminary injunctive relief, nothing in its terms prohibits a\n12  plaintiff from seeking a successive order.\n13  Finally, defendants indicate that they wish to present the\n14  affidavit of several witnesses in an endeavor to defeat\n15  plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.  In light of\n16  the irreparable harm attendant to denial of the right to free\n17  exercise of religion and the defendants' failure to present any\ncolorable arguments raising doubt about the plaintiffs' ability\n19  to prevail at trial, the court declines to hold the plaintiffs'\n20  motion in abeyance pending the presentation of affidavits.  The\n21  defendants can move this court to dissolve the preliminary\n22\nv  Defendants are under the mistaken impression that an\ninjunction is only warranted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c) in order\nto protect the defendants' rights.  The plain language of the rule\nprovides, inter alia. that the court can grant an injunction \"upon\n25  such terms  . ..  as it considers proper  for the security  of the\nadverse party.\"  Thus,  the security  of the adverse party  merely\namounts to a consideration when issuing an injunction.\n12\n\n12=16 DEC 19, 2000 #24490  PAGE: 14/19\n1 injunction and present their evidence at that time.  See L.R.\n2 65-231(f).\n3 IV.\n4 CONTEMPT\n5 Plaintiffs initially moved for an order holding defendants\n6 in contempt for violating the court's preliminary injunction.\n7 In their motion, plaintiffs argued that defendant Newland's\n8 memorandum of August 28, 2000, see Pis.' Motion for Contempt\n9 exh. A, was in violation of the court's injunction by ordering\n10 that an inmate's time away from work/training assignment to\n11 attend Jumu'ah shall be listed as \"A\" time, an unexcused\n12 absence, and that inmates assigned to certain workstations would\n13 not be allowed to return to work after attending Jumu'ah.\n14 Although the plaintiffs subsequently withdrew that motion, the\n15 defendant's directive gives the court some pause.\n16 By considering Jumu'ah services an unexcused absence and by\n17 limiting the ability of those attending Jumu'ah services to\n18 return to work, the defendant's actions have the effect of\n19 forcing plaintiffs to forego good-time credits in exchange for\n20 observing their faith.9  Defendants may be correct that the\n21 command of the court's injunction, barring defendants from\n22 denying good-time credits to plaintiffs, did not give  sufficient\n23\n24\n9  Inmates who are eligible to earn Penal Code § 2933 worktime\ncredits \"shall be awarded  . . . one day of credit for each day of\n25\nqualifying performance!,]\"  15 Cal. Code Reg. § 3044(b){l), which\nis defined as a workday of, \"not  . . . less than six hours\n26\n•  •  •  •\"  Id.\n13\n\n12=16 DEC 19, 2000 #24490  PAGE: 15/19\n1 warning that their compelling plaintiffs to forego good-time\n2 credits amounted to a violation of the injunction.  Nonetheless,\n3 defendant's action in light of this court's earlier ruling in\n4 Fenelon v. Riddle, No. CIV. S-95-954 LKK/JFM, may require an\n5 expansion of the injunction.  See Sharp v. Weston,  F.3d  ,\n6 2000 WL 1753068, at *5 (9th Cir. November 30, 2000)  (failure to\n7 comply with injunction justified entry of a \"comprehensive order\n8 to insure against the risk of inadequate compliance.\")  (quoting\n9 Hutto v. Finnev, 437 U.S. 678  (1978) (internal quotation marks\n10 omitted).\n11 Congress has mandated that in prison condition cases\n12 \"[p]reliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend\n13 no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds\n14 requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means\n15 necessary to correct that harm.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2).\nFollowing this command, the court issued its original injunction\n16\nin general terms in an effort to avoid intrusion into the\n17\nmanagement of the prison.  Defendant's actions, however, have\n18\ndemonstrated that a more intrusive injunction may be necessary\n19\nin order to correct the harm caused by the defendants' policies.\n20\n21 In prior litigation between an inmate at the California\n22 Medical Facility and Cal Terhune, the Director of the California\n23 Department of Corrections, and the current warden of the CMF,\n24 Ana Olivarez-Palmara, this court determined that defendants'\n25 denial of plaintiff's request to use ETO  (Excused Time Off), see\n26\n14\n\n1/  JJLC 19,  2000 #24490  PAGE:  16/19\n1 Cal.

Excused  time off may be  approved\n4 by  work/training  supervisors  only  for  the  below  stated\nreasons. A proposal  to use ETO for any other  reason  requires\n5 approval  by  the  director.\n6 (1)  Family  visiting.  An  inmate  scheduled  for  a  family\nvisit  may  be  permitted  to  visit  in  the  visiting  room\n7 (regular visit) on the first day of a family visit  while\nawaiting  processing,  and  on  the  last  day  of  the  family\n8 visit.\n9 (2) Regular visiting under  extraordinary  circumstances.\nFollowing  are extraordinary  circumstances  for which  use\n10 of ETO is  authorized:\n(A) Out-of-state visitors. Upon  substantiation  that\n11 the  visitor(s)  resides  out-of-state  and  is  in\nCalifornia  for a temporary stay of 30 days or less,\n12 and  the  visitor (s)  has  not  visited  with  the\nparticular  inmate for four months. No more than  two\n13 such  visits  shall  be  permitted  for  each  such\noccurrence.\n14 (B) Excessive  distance. When a visitor must  travel\na  distance  of  250  miles  or  more,  and  has  not\n15 visited  the  inmate  within  the  last  30  days.\n(C)  Weddings.  When  an  inmate  marries,  the  inmate\n16\nmay, with five working days prior approval, use ETO\nfor a visit  on the wedding  day.\n17\n(D) Handicapped.  When  a visitor  is handicapped  as\ndefined by California  law and must  rely  on  special\n18\ntransportation  to  the  institution.  Approval  is\nrequired  five  working  days prior  to the  visit.\n19\n(E) Family emergencies. When death, serious  illness\nor  injury  occurs  to  an  inmate's  immediate  family\n20\nmember,  clergymen,  family members  or close  friends\nmay visit the inmate to offer condolences or  inform\n21\nthe  inmate  of  the  occurrence.\n(F)  Infrequent  visits.  When  an  inmate  normally\n22\nreceives  infrequent  visits  and  a  visitor\nunexpectedly  arrives.  Infrequent  means  not  more\n23\nthan  one visit  each  six months.\n(G) Visiting  during  authorized  absence.  An  inmate\n24\nshall  be  permitted  to  visit  using  ETO  during\napproved  periods  away  from  assignment  involving\n25\ncircumstances  beyond  the  inmate's  control.

At first blush, dt\n3 appears to the undersigned that the court's decision in Fenelon\n4 binds the defendant Cal Terhune in the current action, see Peck\n5 v. Commissioner. 904 F.2d 525, 527  (9th Cir. 1990)  (issue\n6 actually litigated and necessarily determined is conclusive on\n7 subsequent suits based on different causes of action involving\nparty or privy in to prior litigation), but does not necessarily\n8\nbind the other defendants who were not parties to the prior\n9\naction.  See Whitley v. Seibel, 676 F.2d 245, 248 n.l  (7th Cir.\n10\n1982) .\n11\n12 In light of these consideration, the court requests the\n13 parties to brief the issue of whether the injunction heretofore\n14 granted should be expanded to include a further order\n15 prohibiting defendants from depriving the plaintiff class of an\n16 opportunity to earn work time credits by virtue of attending\n17 Juiuu' ah.\n18\n19\n20\n21\n(3) Temporary  community  leave.\n22\n(4)  Special  religious  functions,  other  than  routine\n23\nservices.\n24\n(5) Non-routine recreation and  entertainment  activities.\n25 (6)  Emergency  telephone  access.\n26 Cal.

CHAVEZ,\n19 Defendants.\n20\n21 Plaintiffs are a class of Muslim state prisoners housed at\n22 California State Prison-Solano seeking relief under 42 U.S.C.\n23 § 1983 for alleged violations of their First Amendment right to\n24 the free exercise of their religion, as well as their Fourteenth\n25 Amendment right to Equal Protection of the law.  This matter\n26 comes before the court or. plaintiffs' motion to renew the\n\n09:16 JAN 15, 2003 #80983\n1 court's injunction with respect to grooming.  The standards for\n2 such a motion are well-known and need not be repeated here.  See\n3 Topanaa Press Inc. v.'Citv of Los Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524, 1528\n4 (9th Cir. 1993).\n5 Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction identical to\n6 that which the court has previously ordered.  They argue that\n7 the court may summarily reenter a preliminary injunction based\n8 upon the principles of the law of the case.\nThe law of the case doctrine requires that when a court\n•9\n10 decides on a rule, it should ordinarily follow that rule during\n11 the pendency of the case.  See Arizona v. California, 460 U.S.\n12 605, 618  (1983) .  It is, of course, merely a prudential\n13 doctrine; nonetheless, the doctrine guides the court's\n14 discretion on issues such as the one at bar.  See Slotkin v.\n15 Citizens Cas. Co., 614 F.2d 301, 312  (2d Cir. 1979)  (The law of\n16 the case \"does not constitute a limitation on the court's power\n17 but merely expresses the general practice of refusing to reopen\n18 what has been decided.\")  \"The rule of practice promotes\n19 finality and efficiency of the judicial process by  ^protecting\n20 against the agitation of settled issues . . . .'\"  Christianson\n21 v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816  (1988).\n22 Grounds justifying departure from the law of the case\n23 include substantially different evidence, a change in\n24 controlling authority, or the need to correct a clearly\n25 erroneous decision which would work, a manifest injustice.  See\n26 White v. Murtha. .-377 F.2d 428, 431-432  (5th Cir. 1967).\n\n09:17 JAN 15, 2003 #809B3  PflGE: 4/7\nThe defendants present no new arguments in opposition to\nplaintiffs' motion.  Defendants' contentions were previously\nargued and rejected when the court issued the first, second,\nthird and fourth preliminary injunctions and in the court's\norder denying defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claim\nunder the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.\nTwo recent Ninth Circuit rulings in this case confirm the\nsoundness of the court's previous decisions.\n• 9 First, the Ninth Circuit has affirmed the propriety of the\n10 issuance of successive preliminary injunctions and has made\n11 clear that such a renewal presents no conflict with the\n12 automatic expiration provision of the Prison Litigation Reform\n13 Act,  18 U.S.C. § 3636(a).(2).  See Mavwearhers v. Newland.  258\n14 F.3d 930  (9th Cir. 2CC1).  Accordingly, the court affirms its\n15 prior rejection of defendants' contentions because the\n16 defendants have failed to identify substantially  different\n17 evidence, a change in the controlling  legal authority, or any\n18 error in the court's prior decisions.  See White, 377 F.2d at\n19 431-432.\n20 Second, the Ninth Circuit recently upheld the Religious\n21 Land Use and Institutionalized  Persons Act  (RLUIPA) in the face\n22 of defendants' constitutional challenges.  See Mayweathers v.\n23 Newland, 01-16505  (9th Cir. Dec. 27, 2002).  Despite that\nruling, defendants repeat their contentions that the statute is\n25 unconstitutional, that this court lacks jurisdiction to proceed\n26 on plaintiffs' RLUIPA claims, and that the preliminary\n3\n\n09:1? JAN 15, 2003 #80983  PAGE: 5/7\ninjunction violates the Establishment Clause.  The decision of\nthe court of appeals forecloses those arguments.\nIn granting this renewed preliminary injunction, the court\nspecifically finds that the relief afforded extends no further\nthan necessary to correct the threat to plaintiffs' rights under\nRLUIPA and, accordingly, it is narrowly drawn and the least\nintrusive means necessary to correct the harm.  See 18 O.S.C.\n§ 3626 (a) (2) .  In so finding, the court incorporates by\nreference the analysis set forth in its order dated February 8,\n10 2001.  There, the court found that there was a substantial\n11 likelihood that defendants' grooming policy violated plaintiffs'\n12 rights under RLUIPA.  The court further found that a preliminary\n13 injunction preventing defendants from imposing discipline on\n14 plaintiffs for wearing beards in contravention of the challenged\n15 policy was necessary to correct the violation of plaintiffs'\n16 federally-protected rights:\n17 [W]ithout an order enjoining the grooming regulations\nand allowing plaintiffs to grow half-inch beards,\n18 plaintiffs may lose the opportunity to earn time off\nfrom their sentences, face restricted visiting hours,\n19 be restricted from canteen draw, lose time outside\ntheir cells, lose work credits, and be denied the\n•20 opportunity: to attend Jumu'ah.\n21 February 8, 2001 Order at 15.  The preliminary injunction is\n22 thus necessary to correct that harm justifying injunctive\n23 relief.\n24 According to the legislative history behind § 3626(a) (2),\n25 the \"provision stops judges from imposing remedies intended to\n26 effect an overall modernization of local prison systems or\n4\n\n09=17 JAN 15/  2003 #80983  PflGE:  6/7\n1 provide an overall improvement in prison conditions\" by\n2 \"limiting remedies to those necessary to remedy the proven\n3 violation of federal rights.\" H.R.Rep. No. 21, 104th Cong.,\n4 1st Sess. 7, at 24 n. 2 (1995).  Far from seeking to effect an\n5 overall improvement in prison conditions, the injunction at\n6 issue here is narrowly drawn to remedy a particular violation of\nRLUIPA.  In granting the original injunction, the court noted\n• 7\n8 that it is \"not unsympathetic to the inconveniences that an\n9 injunction may cause to the prison staff at CSP-Solano.\"\n10 February 8, 2001 Order at 16.  Nevertheless, for all the reasons\n11 stated in the court's original order, injunctive relief remains\n12 appropriate.\n13 For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs' motion to renew the\n14 court's grooming injunction for a fourth time is GRANTED.\n15 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n16 DATED:  January 13, 2003.\n17\n18 IRENCE K\\ \"KARLTON\nSENIOR JUD\n19 UNITED STATER DISTRICT COUR\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\n09:18  JPlN 15,  2003  #80983  PAGE:  7/7\nndd\nUnited States District Court\nfor the\nEastern District of California\nJanuary 15, 20 03\n* * CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE * *\n2:96-CV-01582\nMayweathers\nv.\nSutton\nI, the undersigned, hereby certify that I am an employee in the Office of\nthe Clerk, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California.\nThat on  January 15, 2003, I SERVED a true and correct copy(ies) of\nthe attached, by placing said copy(ies) in a postage paid envelope\naddressed to the person(s) hereinafter listed, by depositing said\nenvelope in the U.S. Mail, by placing said copy(ies) into an inter-office\ndelivery receptacle located in the Clerk's office, or, pursuant to prior\nauthorization by counsel, via facsimile.\nSusan Dee Christian  SJ/LKK\nPrison Law Office\nGeneral Delivery  CF/JFM\nSan Quentin, CA  94 9 64\nTami M Warwick\nAttorney General's Office for the State of California\nPO BOX 944255\n1300 I Street\nSuite 125\nSacramento, CA  94244-2550\nJohn K Vincent\nUnited States Attorney\n501 I Street\nSuite 10-100\nSacramento, CA  95814\nMarc D Stern\nNOT EDCA ADMITTED\nAmerican Jewish Congress\n.. 15 East 84th Street\nNew York, NY  10028\nJack L.

CHAVEZ,\n19 Defendants.\n20\n21 Plaintiffs are a class of Muslim  state prisoners housed at\n22 California State Prison-Solano seeking relief under 42 U.S.C.\n23 § 1983 for alleged violations of their First Amendment right to the\n24 free exercise of their religion, as well as their Fourteenth\n25 Amendment right to Equal Protection of the law.  This matter comes\n26 before  the  court  on  plaintiffs'  motion  to  renew  the  court's\n1\n\n#73781  PAGE: 3/7\n1 injunction with  respect  to grooming.  The  standards  for such a\n2 motion are well-known and need not be repeated here.  See Topanaa\n3 Press Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524, 1528  (9th Cir.\n4 1993)  .\n5 Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction identical to that\n6 which the court has previously ordered.  They argue that the court\n7 may  summarily  reenter  a  preliminary  injunction  based  upon  the\n8 principles of the law of the case.\n9 The  law  of  the  case  doctrine  requires  that  when  a  court\n10 decides on a rule, it should ordinarily follow that rule during the\n11 pendency of the case.  See Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618\n12 (1983).  It is, of course, merely a prudential doctrine;\n13 nonetheless, the doctrine guides the court's discretion on issues\n14 such as the one at bar.  See Slotkin v. Citizens Cas. Co., 614 F.2d\n15 301, 312  (2d Cir. 1979)  (The law of the case \"does not constitute\n16 a limitation on the court's power but merely expresses the general\n17 practice of refusing to reopen what has been decided.\")  \"The rule\n18 of  practice  promotes  finality  and  efficiency  of  the  judicial\n19 process by  ^protecting against the agitation of settled issues\n20 .  . . .'\"  Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.. 48 6 U.S.\n21 800, 816  (1988).\n22 Grounds justifying departure from the law of the case include\n23 substantially different evidence, a change in controlling\n24 authority,  or the  need  to correct  a clearly  erroneous  decision\n25 which would work a manifest injustice.  See White v. Murtha, 377\n26 F.2d 428, 431-432  (5th Cir. 1967).\n2\n\nM-JV i, cxsoc-  •  #73781  PfiGE:  4/7\n  a\nDefendants' contentions were previously argued and rejected\nwhen the court issued the first, second and third preliminary\ninjunctions and in the court's order denying defendants' motion to\ndismiss plaintiffs' claim under the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized  Persons Act.\"  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has\nrecently  affirmed  the propriety of the issuance of successive\npreliminary  injunctions  and has made  clear  that  such  renewal\npresents no conflict with the automatic expiration provision of the\nPrison  Litigation  Reform  Act,  18 U.S.C.  §  3636(a)(2).  See\n10 Mavweathers v. Newland, 258 E\\ 3d 930 (9th Cir. 2001).  Accordingly,\n11 the court affirms its prior rejection of defendants' contentions\n12 because  the defendants  have  failed  to identify  substantially\n13 different evidence, a change in the controlling legal authority,\n14 or any error in the court's prior decisions.  See White, 377 F.2d\n15 at 431-432.\n16 In granting  this renewed  preliminary  injunction, the court\n17 specifically finds that the relief afforded extends no further than\n18 necessary to correct the threat to plaintiffs' rights under RLUIPA\n19 and,  accordingly, it is narrowly  drawn and the least  intrusive\n20 means necessary to correct the harm.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2).\n21 In so finding, the court incorporates by reference the analysis set\n22 forth in its order dated February 8, 2001.  There, the court found\n23 that there was a substantial likelihood that defendants' grooming\n24\n1  It is only because of the defendants' insistence on\n25 exercising  their  right to appeal each of the previously  issued\norders that the court has been unable to try the matter and finally\n26 resolve it.\n3\n\n#73781  PAGE: 5/7\npolicy violated plaintiffs' rights under RLUIPA.  The court further\nfound  that  a preliminary  injunction  preventing  defendants  from\nimposing  discipline  on  plaintiffs  for  wearing  beards  in\ncontravention of the challenged policy was necessary to correct the\nviolation of plaintiffs' federally-protected rights:\n6 [W]ithout  an order  enjoining  the grooming  regulations\nand  allowing  plaintiffs  to  grow  half-inch  beards,\n7 plaintiffs  may  lose the opportunity  to  earn time off\nfrom their sentences, face restricted visiting hours, be\nrestricted  from canteen draw,  lose time outside their\ncells, lose work credits, and be denied the opportunity\nto attend Jumu'ah.\n10 February 8, 2001 Order ar 15.  The preliminary injunction is thus\n11 necessary to correct ~ha~ harm justifying injunctive relief.\n12 According to the legislative history behind § 3626(a) (2), the\n13 \"provision stops judges from inposing remedies intended to effect\n14 an overall modernization  of  local prison  systems  or provide  an\n15 overall improvement in prison conditions\" by \"limiting remedies to\n16 those necessary to remedy the proven violation of federal rights.\"\n17 H.R.Rep. No. 21, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 7, at 24 n. 2 (1995).  Far\n18 from seeking to effect an overall improvement in prison conditions,\n19 the injunction at issue here is narrowly drawn to remedy a\n20 particular violation of RLUIPA.  In granting the original\n21 injunction, the court noted that it is \"not unsympathetic to the\n22 inconveniences that an injunction may cause to the prison staff at\n23 CSP-Solano.\"  February 8, 2C01 Order at 16.  Nevertheless, for all\n24 the reasons stated in the court's original order, injunctive relief\n25 remains appropriate.\n26\n\n#73781  PAGE: 6/7\nHUV\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons, plaintiffs' motion to renew the\ncourt's grooming injunction for a fourth time is GRANTED.\n3 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n4 DATED:  October 29, 2002.\n5\n6\nSENIOR\\JUDGE\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\nPfiGE=  7/7\nndd\nUnited  States  District  Court\nfor  the\nEastern District of California\nNovember 1, 2 0 02\n* * CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE * *\n2:96-CV-01582\nMayweathers\nv.\nSutton\nI, the undersigned, hereby certify that I am an employee in the Office of\nthe Clerk, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California.\nThat on  November 1, 2 002, I SERVED a true and correct copy(ies) of\nthe attached, by placing said copy(ies) in a postage paid envelope\naddressed to the person(s) hereinafter listed, by depositing said\nenvelope in the U.S. Mail, by placing said copy(ies) into an inter-office\ndelivery receptacle located in the Clerk's office, or, pursuant to prior\nauthorization by counsel, via facsimile.\nSusan Dee Christian  SJ/LKK\nLaw Offices of Stewart Katz\n1001 G Street  VC/GGH\nSuite 100\nSacramento, CA 95 814\nTami M Warwick\nAttorney General's Office for the State of California\nPO Box 944255\n1300 I Street\nSuite 125\nSacramento, CA 94244-2550\nJohn K Vincent\nUnited States Attorney\n501 I Street\nSuite 10-100\nSacramento, CA 95814\nMarc D Stern\nNOT EDCA ADMITTED\nAmerican Jewish Congress\n15 East 84th Street\nNew York, NY  10 028\nJack L.
