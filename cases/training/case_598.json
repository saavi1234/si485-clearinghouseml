The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by the length and conditions of their confinement.  In addition, they complained of interference with their visitation and mailing privileges, access to counsel, access to the courts, and access to the media, as well as inadequate medical care, lack of an adequate and wholesome diet, and other allegedly repressive measures to their physical and emotional detriment.  </p><p>On February 10, 1976, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Judge Alfonso J.

Specifically, the court held that the prisoners' rights had been violated by continuous segregation of prisoners 24 hours per day except for meager out of cell movements, denial of fresh air and regular outdoor exercise, unwarranted and cruel use of tear gas to remove prisoners from their cells, and excessive use of physical restraints.

      "text": "690 F.2d 742 (1982)\nJohnny L. SPAIN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees,\nv.\nLouis MOUNTANOS, et al., Defendants, and\nKenneth Cory, Controller, of the State of California, Defendant-Appellant.\nNo. 81-4173.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.\nArgued and Submitted April 15, 1982.\nDecided October 21, 1982.\n743 *743 Gordon Zane, San Francisco, Cal., for defendant-appellant.\nPaul Halvonik, Halvonik & Halvonik, Berkeley, Cal., for plaintiffs-appellees.\nBefore GOODWIN, FLETCHER and POOLE, Circuit Judges.\nPOOLE, Circuit Judge.\nThis is an appeal by the Controller of the State of California, Kenneth Cory, from an order of the district court\ndirecting him to issue a warrant on the State Treasurer for payment of attorney's fees owed to appellees as the\nprevailing party under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The district court issued the order after the State legislature refused to\nappropriate the money for the award. In this appeal Cory claims that the district court erred in invoking its\nequitable authority under Rule 70 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to enforce the judgment, that State law\nprohibits the Controller from taking the action the court directed, and that the district court erred in awarding\nattorney's fees expended in collecting the original award as well as interest on the award. We affirm.\nI. FACTS\nAppellees brought this action in 1973 alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement at San Quentin State\nPrison. After a lengthy trial, the district court entered a broad ranging injunction against certain prison practices. \n744 Spain v. Procunier, 408 F.Supp. 534 (N.D.Cal.1976). On appeal this *744 court affirmed in part and reversed in\npart. Spain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189 (9th Cir.1979). Upon remand, the parties entered into an agreement of\nsettlement which included a provision that the defendants would pay fees to appellees' attorneys of $70,000.\nShortly afterwards, the State Attorney General submitted a claim to the State Board of Control requesting that the\nfunds necessary to pay the attorney's fees be included in the next omnibus appropriations act. The Board of\nControl in turn submitted the claim to the State legislature. The California Assembly voted an appropriation to\nsatisfy the award, but the California Senate specifically refused to do so, and a Conference Committee deleted\nthe item from the money bill. Both houses approved an appropriations bill without the attorney's fees.\nAppellees then filed a motion in the district court for orders adding certain State officials as party defendants and\ncompelling them to pay the $70,000. On March 10, 1981, the district court entered an order making Kenneth\nCory, Jesse Unruh, Treasurer of the State of California, and Ruth Rushen, Director of the California Department\nof Corrections, additional parties to the main action and ordering them served as parties. The order directed\nRushen to submit a requisition within 30 days to Cory for the drawing of a warrant on the State Treasurer for the\noriginal $70,000 in attorney's fees, together with 8% interest from the date of the original order approving the\nsettlement, and for another $6,318.00 attorney's fees expended in collecting the main award. It then directed\nCory to issue the warrant to the State Treasurer, who was to pay the sums indicated to appellees' attorneys \"out\nof funds appropriated for the support and operation of the California Department of Corrections or any other\n\nfunds subject to the control of the State Treasurer.\" Cory took this appeal and shortly thereafter the district court\n[1]\nstayed further proceedings pending the outcome here.\nII. The Order to State Officials\nAs the district court recognized, appellees are entitled to attorney's fees as the prevailing parties under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1988. In Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), the Supreme Court held that the\nEleventh Amendment does not bar an attorney's fee award against a state under that statute. In particular, the\nCourt concluded that in enacting section 1988, Congress intended to invoke its enforcement power under section\n5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to remove the states' protection under the Eleventh Amendment. 437 U.S. at\n694, 98 S.Ct. at 2575; see also Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 132, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2576, 65 L.Ed.2d 653\n(1980). The Court also concluded that such an award was appropriately directed against the State even though\nthe State or one of its departments was not named as a party, since the plaintiffs' suit was \"for all practical\npurposes, [brought] against the State itself.\" 437 U.S. at 700, 98 S.Ct. at 2578.\nThe Attorney General of California, who has represented appellant Cory throughout this proceeding, generally\n[2]\nrecognizes the impact of Hutto v. Finney.  However, he argues that appellees' exclusive means of enforcing the\naward is through a writ of execution pursuant to Rule 69 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Therefore he\nconcludes that the court acted improperly in invoking its equitable authority under Rule 70 to attempt to enforce\nthe judgment.\nOrdinarily, the equitable remedies provided under Rule 70 are not appropriate in enforcing a monetary judgment. \n745 See*745Gabovitch v. Lundy, 584 F.2d 559, 560 n.1 (1st Cir. 1978); 7 J. Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 69.03[2] (2d\ned. 1978). However, under the extraordinary circumstances here where the judgment is against a state, which\nrefuses to appropriate funds through the normal process provided by state law, the district court should not\nnecessarily be reduced to satisfying a judgment through the cumbersome procedure of attempting to execute\n[3]\nagainst state property or bank accounts.  It may, instead, pursue any remedy provided in Rule 69 or Rule 70 to\nenforce the award, including ordering state officials to pay the claim.\nThe legislative history of section 1988 supports this conclusion. The Senate Report on section 1988 states that\nthe award should \"be collected either directly from the official, from funds of his agency or under his control, or\nfrom the state or local government.\" S.Rep.No.1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 reprinted in 1976 U.S.Code Cong. &\nAd.News 5908, 5913. There is no suggestion in the report that a writ of execution is the only means of enforcing\nthe award. Accordingly, those courts which have addressed this issue under circumstances similar to those\ninvolved here have specifically held that a district court may invoke its equitable authority under Rule 70 to\nenforce an attorney's fee award under section 1988 against the state. See Gary W. v. Louisana, 622 F.2d 804,\n806-07 (5th Cir. 1980),cert. denied,450 U.S. 994, 101 S.Ct. 1695, 68 L.Ed.2d 193 (1981); Gates v. Collier, 616\nF.2d 1268, 1271 (5th Cir. 1980); see also Gilbert v. Johnson, 490 F.2d 827, 829 (5th Cir. 1970) (approving use of\nRule 70 to enforce back pay award against the Veterans Administration.)\nThe Attorney General contends also that the order here is improper because it compels the Controller to act in\nviolation of State law. The California Constitution provides that \"money may be drawn from the Treasury only\nthrough an appropriation made by law.\" Cal.Const. Art. XVI, § 7 (West 1982). Section 4.5 of the 1980-81\nCalifornia State Budget Act states that no funds appropriated by the Act may be used to pay an attorney's fee\naward unless the award is \"specifically authorized and set forth in an item or section of this act or ... expressly\nauthorized by a statutory provision other than Section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\" 1980 Cal.Stat. ch.\n510, § 4.5. Finally, section 12440 of the California Government Code (West 1980) prohibits the Controller from\ndrawing warrants on the treasury unless \"authorized by law, and unless unexhausted specific appropriations\nprovided by law are available to meet it.\" The Attorney General therefore concludes that since the legislature here\nspecifically refused to pass the appropriation for the attorney's fees award, as required by the 1980 Budget Act,\nsection 12440 prohibits the Controller from complying with the district court's order by issuing a warrant without\nviolating State law.\n\nThe Attorney General's argument represents \"a delicately wrought chain of apparent logic that leads to an\n746 ineluctably wrong conclusion.\" Gary W. v. Louisiana, 441 F.Supp. 1121, 1125 (E.D.La.1977),aff'd.,*746622 F.2d\n804 (5th Cir. 1980). Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, a court, in enforcing federal\nlaw, may order state officials to take actions despite contravening state laws. Thus in Washington v. Washington\nState Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association, 443 U.S. 658, 99 S.Ct. 3055, 61 L.Ed.2d 823 (1979),\nthis court had affirmed a district court order directing the Washington State Department of Fisheries to adopt\nregulations protecting Indian fishing rights. In a parallel State proceeding, the Washington Supreme Court had\nheld that the Fisheries Department had no authority under State law to take the steps directed by the district\ncourt. Therefore the Washington Court concluded that the order was void since the federal court did not have the\npower to order state officials \"to do any act which they were not authorized to do by laws of the state from which\nthey derive their power.\" Puget Sound Gillnetters Association v. Moos, 88 Wash.2d 677, 684, 565 P.2d 1151,\n1155 (1977).\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari in both the State and federal court proceedings, affirming this court's\ndecision and vacating the decision of the Washington Supreme Court. The Court specifically rejected the State\ncourt's conclusion regarding the State officials' capacity to act under State law:\nState-law prohibition against compliance with the District Court's decree cannot survive the\ncommand of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S.\n1 [78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5]; Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. 506 [16 L.Ed. 169]. It is also clear that\nGame and Fisheries, as parties to this litigation, may be ordered to prepare a set of rules that will\nimplement the Court's interpretation of the rights of the parties even if State law withholds from\nthem the power to do so. E.g. North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43 [91 S.Ct.\n1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586]; Griffin v. County School Board, 377 U.S. 218 [84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d\n256]; Tacoma v. Taxpayers, 357 U.S. 320 [78 S.Ct. 1209, 2 L.Ed.2d 1345].\n443 U.S. at 695, 99 S.Ct. at 3079.\nIn Gates v. Collier, 616 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir. 1978), the Fifth Circuit, faced with nearly identical objections to those\nraised here affirmed an order very similar to that now challenged. The district court, in attempting to enforce an\nattorney's fees award under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 against the State of Mississippi, ordered the State Auditor to issue\na warrant upon the State Treasurer and ordered the State Treasurer to honor the warrant and pay the attorney's\nfees. The court of appeals rejected the state's argument that Mississippi law prevented the officials from honoring\nthe order since the legislature had not appropriated any funds for the award:\nCongress has declared that states and their officials who violate federal civil rights laws must\nreimburse the successful plaintiff for costs incurred in seeking redress. To strike down the order in\nthis case because it conflicts with the laws of Mississippi would be no different than reversing a\nbare judgment for attorney's fees. In either case, we would be allowing the state, by legislative\naction, to recloak itself with the Eleventh Amendment immunity which Congress has chosen to\nremove. Such a result would be contrary to the Supremacy Clause of the United States\nConstitution.\n616 F.2d at 1272.\nWe agree with the Fifth Circuit that a state cannot frustrate the intent of section 1988 by setting up state law\nbarriers to block enforcement of an attorney's fees award. Thus we conclude that the district court acted within its\nauthority in issuing the order to the Controller and other State officials.\nIn affirming the district court's order, we do not mean to suggest that the district court must proceed under Rule\n[4]\n70 rather than Rule 69. The alternative of issuing a writ of execution still remains open to the court.  Nor do we\n747 express any opinion how *747 the district court should implement its order should it choose to proceed under the\norder appealed from. That task remains open for the court below which has plenary power to enforce its\ncommands. We simply conclude that the district court did not act improperly in issuing its order directed to state\nofficials named therein.\n\nIII. Attorney's Fees for Collection\nThe district court awarded appellees' attorneys an additional $6,318 in attorney's fees expended in collecting the\noriginal $70,000 stipulated fee. This court has held that such an award for fees on collection is proper under\nsection 1988. See Southeast Legal Defense Group v. Adams, 657 F.2d 1118, 1126 (9th Cir. 1981); see also \nStanford Daily v. Zurcher, 64 F.R.D. 680, 683-84 (N.D.Cal.1974); aff'd,550 F.2d 464 (9th Cir. 1977),rev'd on\nother grounds,436 U.S. 547, 98 S.Ct. 1970, 56 L.Ed.2d 525 (1978) (refusal to award fees expended on\ncollection would permit dilution of initial attorney's fees award.)\nThe Attorney General, however, contends that the amount the court awarded was excessive. The amount of\nattorney's fees to be awarded is left to the discretion of the trial court. See Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v.\nGoldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 221 (9th Cir. 1964),cert. denied,379 U.S. 880, 85 S.Ct. 143, 13 L.Ed.2d 87 (1964).\nNevertheless, in Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67 (9th Cir. 1975),cert. denied,425 U.S. 951, 96\nS.Ct. 1726, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976), we held that in exercising its discretion the district court must take into\naccount certain enumerated factors. There is no indication in the record that the district judge considered the Kerr\nfactors in making his award. Instead, the court simply seems to have multiplied the number of compensable\nhours claimed by appellees in their declarations by the hourly rate they suggested. Ordinarily remand of such an\naward would be appropriate to permit the district court to reconsider the award in light of the Kerr factors. See \nHarmon v. San Diego County, 664 F.2d 770, 772 (9th Cir. 1981); Ellis v. Cassidy, 625 F.2d 227, 231 (9th Cir.\n1980).\nIt appears, however, that the Attorney General's claim of abuse of the district court's discretion in awarding\nattorney's fees was waived in the proceedings below. At the hearing before the district judge on attorney's fees\nheld February 17, 1981, appellees' attorneys offered to abide by the district court's judgment in setting the\namount of fees expended in collecting the original award. In response, the Attorney General indicated his\nwillingness to permit the court to \"look at the points and authorities and papers we have presented here\" and to\n\"stipulate that your honor could decide what would be a reasonable fee for that kind of work.\" (R.T. 10-11). The\nAttorney General indicated that his main disagreement with the appellees' attorneys concerned their claim for\ntime spent in their unsuccessful attempt to lobby the California legislature to appropriate the attorney's fee award\n00 the amount for which time the district court explicitly excluded from its final award. Therefore, in view of the\n97\nAttorney General's agreement to abide by the district court's decision regarding the additional award, we\nconclude that a remand to consider the Kerr factors is unnecessary in this case. We affirm the additional award.\nIV. Interest on the Original Award\nFinally, the Attorney General challenges the district court's allowance of interest on the original $70,000 attorney's\nfees award computed at 8% interest from April 22, 1980, the date of the formal stipulation between the parties\nsetting the $70,000 figure. Title 28 U.S.C. section 1961 provides that \"[i]nterest shall be allowed on any money\njudgment in a civil case recovered in a district court\" and that interest should run from the date of the entry of\n748 judgment. Although this court has never addressed the issue whether section 1961 applies to attorney's *748\nfees awards under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, it has concluded that section 1961 permits interest on attorney's fees\n[5]\nawards in antitrust actions made pursuant to a similar attorney's fees statute, 15 U.S.C. § 15. See Perkins v.\nStandard Oil Co., 487 F.2d 672, 675-76 (9th Cir. 1973); Mt. Hood Stages, Inc. v. Greyhound Corp., 616 F.2d 394,\n406 n. 10 (9th Cir. 1980),cert. denied,449 U.S. 831, 101 S.Ct. 99, 66 L.Ed.2d 36 (1980); Twin City Sportservice,\nInc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 1291, 1316-17 (9th Cir. 1982).\nWe see no reason to distinguish between the two statutes in allowing interest on attorney's fees. Indeed, given\nthe acknowledged purpose of section 1988 to encourage private actions to enforce civil rights statutes where a\nmonetary judgment in such actions is often nominal or, as in this case, not available at all, see S.Rep.No.1011,\n94th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 reprinted in 1976 Code Cong. & Ad.News at 5910-11, the justification for awarding\ninterest on attorney's fees under section 1988 is stronger than in awards in antitrust actions where a prevailing\n[6]\nplaintiff will usually recover damages. See Gates v. Collier, 616 F.2d at 1272-78.  Under these circumstances, it\n\nwould be anomalous to permit the State in effect to reduce the award by withholding payment for a considerable\ntime. See Perkins, 487 F.2d at 676 (defendant should not be permitted free use of money judgment for attorney's\nfees while case is on appeal).\nWe therefore conclude that the district court did not err in allowing interest on the $70,000 attorney's fees award\nto which appellees were entitled under section 1988.\nThe judgments of the district court are in all respects affirmed.\n[1] The State Treasurer, Jesse Unruh, did not take any position in the proceedings and does not appeal the\ncourt's order. Ruth Rushen, the Director of the Department of Corrections, opposed the order below but does not\njoin Cory in this appeal.\n[2] In his brief the Attorney General suggests that the Supreme Court \"clearly erred\" in Hutto in not giving\nsufficient weight to the state's interest in avoiding sizable attorney's fees awards. To the extent the Attorney\nGeneral seriously advocates this position, his argument is directed to the wrong court.\n[3] Moreover, the Attorney General's position on appeal ignores the difficulties raised by California law in\nenforcing a writ of execution against the state. Rule 69 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the\nprocedure on execution \"shall be in accordance with the practice and procedure of the state in which the district\ncourt is held, ... except that any statute of the United States governs to the extent that it is applicable.\" Section\n965.5(b) of the California Government Code states that State execution provisions are not applicable to\njudgments against the State. \nIt may be that the State's position that execution is the appropriate remedy here is a tacit recognition that,\nalthough § 1988 does not contain a specific execution provision, it permits execution here notwithstanding state\nlaw. See Gary W. v. Louisiana, 441 F.Supp. 1121, 1126-27 (E.D.La.1977),aff'd,622 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1980); \nCollins v. Thomas, 649 F.2d 1203, 1206 (5th Cir. 1981),cert. denied,456 U.S. 936, 102 S.Ct. 1992, 72 L.Ed.2d\n455 (1982). That issue is not properly before us but we note that such use of a writ of execution would also\nrequire the district court to conclude that federal law superceded State law.\nIn any event we question that the spectacle of federal marshalls seizing State property or bank accounts is\nsomehow less destructive of the principles of federalism than the method chosen here by the district court.\n[4] The record indicates that shortly before the stay entered by the district court pending this appeal, appellees\nmoved for a writ of execution on State property. Therefore, on remand that motion will still be before the court.\n[5] Section 15 provides that a successful plaintiff is entitled to treble damages \"and the cost of suit, including a\nreasonable attorney's fee.\" Section 1988 provides that a court, in its discretion, \"may allow the prevailing party ...\na reasonable attorney's fee as part of costs.\"\n[6] In Gates, the court distinguished a prior Fifth Circuit case, Carpa, Inc. v. Ward Foods, Inc., 567 F.2d 1316 (5th\nCir. 1978) which had held that interest was not allowable under 15 U.S.C. § 15, concluding that the policy behind\nthe enactment of § 1988 favored allowing interest on attorney's fees.

Gen., Sanford Svetcov, Deputy Atty. Gen., San Francisco, Cal., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nZIRPOLI, District Judge.\nINTRODUCTION\nFederal jurisdiction is invoked in this case under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. section 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C.\nsection 1983. This action effectively began on December 28, 1973, with the filing of an amended complaint\nwherein plaintiffs, inmates at the Adjustment Center (hereinafter referred to as \"AC\"), at the California State\nPrison at San Quentin alleged that their constitutional rights under the First, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the\n[1]\nConstitution of the United States have been and continue to be violated.  The complaint named as defendants\nDirector of Corrections Raymond K. Procunier, San Quentin Warden Louis Nelson, Associate Warden John Doe\nJacobs, and Correctional Officers Campbell, Palmer, and K. E. Thomas. Prior to submission of the case and\npursuant to Rule 25(d), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the present Director of Corrections, J. J. Enomoto, and\nthe present Warden at San Quentin, R. M. Rees, were added as defendants solely for purposes of injunctive\nrelief. The case was dismissed as to defendants Jacobs and Campbell and as to K. W. Britt, who was named as\na defendant while temporarily acting as Warden at San Quentin. The court now dismisses the case as to\ndefendant Palmer since the evidence fails to disclose any activity on his part which justifies his further retention in\nthe case.\nPlaintiffs challenge the length and conditions of their confinement and treatment at the AC as well as certain\npractices of the defendants which allegedly impermissibly interfere with their visitor and mailing privileges and\nwith their rights of access to effective assistance of counsel, access to the courts, and access to the media.\nAdditionally they complain of lack of adequate medical care and attention, lack of an adequate and wholesome\ndiet and other allegedly repressive measures to their physical and emotional detriment.\nFollowing the denial of two motions to dismiss, a motion for summary judgment and a motion to refer the case to\na three-judge federal court, all of which were found to be without merit, the parties agreed to defer trial of the\ndamages claims until the conclusion of the trial of the equitable issues. That trial consumed 29 trial days. After\nbriefing of the issues, the case was then submitted to the court.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing and before briefing, the court indicated that there appeared to be merit in\nplaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claims of cruel and unusual punishment as they relate to the length and conditions\nof plaintiffs' segregated confinement and treatment on the first tier of the AC, with its consequent denial of\noutdoor exercise, and as they relate to the impermissible and dehumanizing restraints applied to plaintiffs for all\nout-of-cell movements. Thereafter the defendants submitted a plan of outdoor exercise for inmates at the AC and\n\nindicated that the entire subject of out-of-cell movements and visiting privileges was under review. They agreed to\n537 submit progress reports on each of these two matters every 30 days. Eight such *537 reports have been received\nby the court. On analysis the court finds that these reports not only fail to indicate any improvements in the\nconditions of confinement and treatment of plaintiffs but also fail to overcome the Eighth Amendment complaints\nof plaintiffs applicable to all inmates on the first tier of the AC.\nIt is unfortunate that these issues must be resolved by federal court intervention since the problems presented\nencompass basic responsibilities in the administration of state prisons which the state legislature, the governor,\nand duly appointed executive officials of the state are better able and equipped to resolve, given their expertise,\ntheir broad and unrestricted powers of inquiry, and their ability through their power of the purse to initiate\naffirmative action programs. It is obvious that any meaningful and effective resolution of the problems presented\nwill require the appropriation and expenditure of adequate funds for the construction of such new facilities (or the\nremodeling of such old facilities) and the employment of such added personnel as may be needed not only to\nmeet any constitutional deficiencies in the confinement and treatment of prisoners at the AC at San Quentin but\n[2]\nalso any that may exist in other facilities throughout the state prison system.\nWhen the state fails to meet its responsibility to make the required \"mutual accommodation between institutional\nneeds and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application,\" Wolff v. McDonnell,\n418 U.S. 539, 556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), that responsibility becomes the responsibility of\n[3]\na federal district court when proper recourse thereto is made.\nWith this required mutual accommodation in mind, the court reluctantly, but of necessity, must undertake the\nformidable task of balancing institutional needs and objectives against the applicable constitutional provisions. In\nso doing the court must be ever mindful that it is dealing with a \"closed, tightly controlled environment peopled by\nthose who have chosen to violate the criminal law and who have been lawfully incarcerated for doing so,\" an\nenvironment where \"[g]uards and inmates co-exist in direct and intimate contact,\" where \"[t]ension between them\nis unremitting,\" and where \"[f]rustration, resentment, and despair are commonplace.\" Wolff, supra 418 U.S. at\n561, 562, 94 S.Ct. at 2977. It is against this background that the length and conditions of confinement and\ntreatment, disciplinary proceedings, and rules relating to access to counsel, access to the media, mail, visitor,\nrecreational, and other privileges must be structured by prison authorities and evaluated by the court in the\naccommodation process. The court must be mindful, too, that though the rights of prisoners \"may be diminished\nby the needs and exigencies of the institutional environment, a prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional\nprotections. . . . There is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons in this country.\" Wolff,\n538 supra 418 U.S. at 555-56, 94 S.Ct. at 2974. With these considerations *538 in mind the court now examines the\nrelevant history of plaintiffs, the length and conditions of their confinement and treatment and their rights and\nprivileges at the AC.\nTHE EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS\nTestifying in support of their entitlement to relief, plaintiffs described how they got to the AC, how they have been\ntreated there, and the effect which such treatment has had on them. Physicians, including the Medical Director of\nthe San Francisco County Jail and the Director of the Security Ward at San Francisco General Hospital, testified\nin support of plaintiffs' allegations that their health had been adversely affected by the conditions of their\nconfinement.\nTwo ex-guards who used to work in the AC testified in support of plaintiffs' allegations that guards have beaten,\nthreatened, and harassed plaintiffs and other first tier AC prisoners, that prison reports are at times altered, and\nthat the AC guards have a stereotyped view of plaintiffs and treat them in a dehumanizing fashion.\nA professor of pharmacology at Stanford University who is a tear gas expert described the nature and effects of\ntear gas. A prisoner who had been incarcerated in every portion of San Quentin testified that incarceration in the\nAC was the most debilitating. Mothers of two of the plaintiffs and two of plaintiffs' lawyers described the visiting\ndifficulties and the effects visiting problems had on plaintiffs, their visitors, and their access to the courts.\n\nPsychiatric and psychological experts testified that AC conditions threaten the sanity of and dehumanize plaintiffs\nand have already damaged plaintiffs in a way that will only be fully known after they are released.\nThrough former Director of Corrections Procunier, Wardens Nelson and Britt, correctional officers and staff\npersonnel, physicians and psychiatrists, defendants offered testimony on almost every phase of prison life at the\nAC, particularly focusing on life on the first tier where plaintiffs have been and continue to be confined. This\ntestimony covered the physical plant of the AC and its cells, noise levels, heating and ventilating, exercise,\ndiscipline, use of tear gas, use of restraints, medical care and attention, diet, clothing, hygiene, access to\ncounsel, access to the media, and visitor and mail privileges and procedures. On the Eighth Amendment issues\non which the court had expressed particular concern they gave their reasons for the continued confinement of\nplaintiffs on the first tier of the AC and the use of the heavy restraint equipment employed for all of plaintiffs' out-\nof-cell movements.\nAdditionally it should be noted that the court made an unannounced visit and inspection of San Quentin on the\neve of the trial. This tour of inspection lasted four hours, with most of the court's time devoted to the AC.\nTHE PLAINTIFFS\nWith the exception of plaintiff Tate, who has been paroled and is presently on bail in the sum of $100,000, the\nremaining plaintiffs are presently housed in maximum security segregation on the first and most restrictive tier of\nthe AC. They are being confined there pending completion of a trial on an indictment in Marin County Superior\n[4]\nCourt in which all plaintiffs, including Tate, are charged with first degree murder and other felony offenses.\n539 They have been confined *539 on this tier in excess of four years with no indication of when they will be released\n[5]\ntherefrom unless it is sometime after termination of the Marin County trial  or upon full expiration of their\nmaximum terms of imprisonment.\nExtensive efforts of counsel for plaintiffs to relitigate their original convictions and to minimize or excuse the\nseriousness of the crimes for which they were incarcerated and to describe plaintiffs as victims of the social and\neconomic ills of our times are irrelevant to these proceedings. The relevant fact is that each plaintiff violated the\ncriminal law and has been lawfully incarcerated for doing so. All that the court is now called upon to decide is the\nconstitutionality of the length and conditions of their confinement and treatment at the AC.\nSpain.\nJohnny Spain, now 25 years of age, started serving a life sentence on May 5, 1967, after conviction of first\ndegree murder. In November of 1970, while serving that sentence at Soledad State Prison, he was placed in the\nSoledad Adjustment Center for approximately six months. That confinement was purportedly based upon his\nalleged possession of a strike manifesto, but in reality was due to his possession of revolutionary literature\n(including a piece written by him entitled \"Let the White Blood Run\") and his manifest militant political and social\nviews. On May 14, 1971, he was transferred to the first tier of the AC at San Quentin despite recommendations in\nthe transfer report which warned that if Spain were \"retained in AC setting,\" prison would \"in essence turn him\ninto a long-term segregation case with no possibility of productive program involvement for a prolonged period.\"\nThis prophetic observation was ignored and after four and one-half years he continues to be confined on the first\ntier of the AC. While he had some write-ups for infractions of the prison rules, the primary justification asserted for\nhis continuous confinement on the first tier and, for that matter, the continuous confinement of all plaintiffs, has\nbeen the fact that an indictment (now trial) has been pending against all plaintiffs since October 1, 1971.\nAdditional reasons offered for the continuous retention of Spain and all of the plaintiffs include (1) their militant\nand revolutionary views, (2) their proximity to the court where they were facing and are now on trial, (3)\nconvenience of their counsel, (4) protective custody, and (5) the fact that their counsel throughout all these\nproceedings have never made a request for their transfer to some other correctional facility. Except to the extent\nthat protective custody might be warranted in the case of Pinell, the court finds these additional assigned reasons\nto be totally unpersuasive. Protective custody for Pinell may constitute a valid justification for his segregation,\n\nprovided, of course, that he is given a duly noticed hearing with appropriate due process safeguards before such\naction is taken.\nPinell.\nHugo Pinell, now 31 years of age, started serving a sentence of three years to life in February of 1965 after\nconviction of forcible rape. Prior to August 21, 1971, he had established a record of violence in prison which\nincluded a conviction for manslaughter of a guard at Soledad Prison in 1970, a conviction of aggravated assault\non an inmate at Folsom in 1969, and a conviction of aggravated assault on a guard at San Quentin in 1968.\nSince August of 1971 Pinell has been a frequent offender of prison rules and has been the subject of numerous\nwrite-ups concerning serious infractions of these rules. It is probably true that in retaliation against Pinell's\n540 conduct, some prison guards have assaulted or *540 mistreated him. He is described by prison authorities as the\nmost dangerous prisoner at San Quentin. He was transferred to San Quentin and placed on the first tier of the AC\nin June of 1971 and has been there ever since.\nDrumgo.\nFleeta Drumgo, now 29 years of age, has been in prison since he was 20 when he was convicted of second\ndegree burglary and sentenced to six months to 15 years in state prison. In February of 1970, while on the main\nline at Soledad Prison, he and George Jackson and John Clutchette were indicted for the murder of a prison\nguard. The three defendants were transferred to San Quentin Prison where they were placed on the first tier of\nthe AC. In June, 1970, a venue change was granted moving defendants' trial to San Francisco. On March 27,\n1972, Drumgo and his surviving co-defendant were acquitted by a jury. Two weeks later, on April 4, 1972, the AC\nReview Committee recommended that Drumgo be transferred as soon as possible from the San Quentin AC.\nHowever, already indicted in connection with the August 21, 1971, incident, Drumgo was retained in the AC\nwhere he remains to this date. Though acquitted at the trial of the murder of the Soledad guard, he was found\nguilty of that offense by the disciplinary committee. He has a record showing periods of clean time interwoven\nwith a period of unruly and sometimes violent conduct.\nTalamantez.\nLuis Talamantez, now 32 years of age, started serving two consecutive sentences of five years to life in 1965\nafter conviction of two armed robberies of taxicabs. In March of 1970, after five years at San Quentin, he was\nplaced on the first tier of the AC after being accused of an aggravated assault in a B section altercation. The case\nwas referred to the district attorney and in February of 1972 he was acquitted by the jury. By then, however, he\nhad been indicted for alleged involvement in the events of August 21, 1971, and he has been retained\ncontinuously in the AC where he remains today. While the offense of aggravated assault on which he was\nacquitted could have been considered by the disciplinary and classification committees at properly noticed\nhearings, apparently this was not done because of the October, 1971, indictment.\nJohnson.\nDavid Johnson, now 27 years of age, has been in prison since August 5, 1968, when he was convicted of second\ndegree burglary and sentenced to six months to 15 years. He had been previously convicted of battery on a\npolice officer in 1966. On May 6, 1971, after a year and one-half at San Quentin, he was considered for transfer\nto the less secure facility of Palm Hall, but was denied transfer at that time because a suspected enemy was\nincarcerated there. Two weeks later he was accused of aggravated assault on a guard and immediately\ntransferred to the first tier of the AC. The disciplinary committee found Johnson guilty. The matter was referred to\nthe district attorney for prosecution and it was not until January, 1974, that Johnson was informed that the district\nattorney refused to prosecute either for lack of evidence or because Johnson had already been indicted for his\nalleged connection with the August 21, 1971, escape attempt.\n\nTate.\nUntil January 14, 1975, Willie Tate, now 29 years of age, had been in prison continuously since the age of 16.\nWhile in custody at Deuel Vocational Institute in 1965, he was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and\nwas sentenced to six months to ten years in prison. As is evident from the above dates, he served his full ten-\nyear term. In 1966 he was transferred from Vacaville to San Quentin where he remained on the main line until\nFebruary 1969, when he was accused of assaulting another prisoner. When the district attorney refused to\nprosecute, the prison disciplinary committee found Tate guilty as charged and committed him for a year in\n541 segregation *541 in B section. In 1970 he threw hot or scalding water on defendant Thomas and was thereafter\ndisciplined by confinement for a week in a strip cell followed by 40 days in a quiet cell before being placed in a\nregular cell on the first tier where he remained continuously until the conclusion of the maximum term to which he\nwas committed. In the course of the hearing in this case he asserted that he threw hot water on Thomas because\nThomas harassed him by sexual taunts and homosexual slurs while conducting strip searches and supervising\nshowers. On December 18, 1974, he was transferred to the Marin County Jail where he remained until his bail\nwas posted on January 14, 1974. Because Tate has now been released from prison, the equitable issues here\npresented are moot as to him. Hence, any relief accorded the other plaintiffs will have no present application to\nhim.\nCELL CONDITIONS\n[6]\nPlaintiffs are confined on the north side of the first tier of the AC.  It is a three-story building housing 34 inmates\non each floor. While it is the newest and probably the best of San Quentin's antiquated housing facilities and\nhence presents no serious constitutional problems concerning its physical structure, it nevertheless has become\na \"hole\" for isolated segregation because of the prolonged and restrictive housing conditions and dehumanizing\nrestraints placed upon those who are housed there.\n[7]\nThe first floor of the AC has 34 cells, approximately 6 ft. wide, 8 ft. deep, and 9 ft. high  in two rows back to\n[8]\nback divided by a maintenance alley.  Of these cells, 17 on the north side and 11 on the south side are identical\nin construction and equipment and hereafter will be referred to as regular cells. The six remaining cells are\nclassified by the prison administration as \"management\" cells.\nEach regular cell is occupied by only one inmate and consists of a concrete floor, steel sleeping slab extending\nfrom the wall, a sink with hot and cold water, and a seatless toilet. No shelves or cabinets for such items as\n[9]\nclothing, books, letters, and other possessions are provided.  Each occupant of a cell is provided with one\nmattress, two sheets, two blankets, and one pillow.\nRecessed into the cell's rear wall is a 200 or 250 watt light bulb which can be controlled by the prisoner 24 hours\na day. However, these light bulbs are protected by a heavy gauge metal screen and wire-permeated safety glass.\nThe glass has been painted over and materially affects the illuminating power of the light and area of illumination\n542 in each *542 cell. Each segregation cell is now also equipped with radio outlets and the inmates are permitted to\nlisten to the same radio station listened to by the general prison population. There is no television or other\nrecreational facility.\nThe walls, floors, and ceilings of the cells are of concrete construction. The front of the cell is barred, including a\nbarred door equipped with a tray slot. The tray slot is covered with a flap which is locked closed except when the\ninmates are fed their breakfast and dinner meals or handcuffed for out-of-cell movements. It is not opened for\ntheir bag lunch.\nBreakfast and dinner in the AC are the same as for the general population, with a bag (sandwich) lunch served at\n[10]\nnoon. All meals are served in the cells. While it appears that every effort is made to serve hot food as quickly\nas possible by the use of reheating carts at the AC, problems do arise, but these problems appear to the court to\nhave been exaggerated by the prisoners. This is understandable since they have so few distractive activities that\n\nthe arrival of a meal counts as a major event and occupies a primary position in the lives of AC inmates. When\nthe repetitiveness of the menu causes prisoners to \"burn out\" on the fare, the inevitable result is that they often\nthrow their food out of the cells onto the tier floor or at the guard providing the same. Beverages are served from\na pitcher with a long spout (more like a garden bucket) that fits between the bars for pouring into the inmate's\nplastic tumbler. In addition, inmates may purchase food or other items from the canteen, unless this privilege is\ntaken from them for disciplinary reasons. During the past years several of the plaintiffs have had as much as\n$1,000 in their accounts.\nClothing is the same as for the general prison population, except that the inmates receive only one set of blues\neach week. When an inmate leaves the AC for a family or other visit he is dressed in a special white outfit\n(coverall) that differentiates him from the other prisoners and which enables the previously alerted tower guards\nto follow him as he shuffles along under his out-of-cell restraints. Underwear and sox are changed twice a week\non shower days, but there is nothing to preclude an inmate from washing his sox in his cell. Comb, stubbed\ntoothbrush, toothpowder, towel, soap, and toilet paper are issued. Possession of prescription glasses, books,\npapers, correspondence, legal material, and personal clothing is permitted. Verbal and visual contact, but not\nphysical contact, is allowed with other inmates and with family on the occasion of their visits. Smoking is also\npermitted.\nInmates occupy their time in their cells as they wish, subject to prison rules. They are confined to their cells 24\nhours a day, except for showers, family visits, visits to Adult Authority hearings, hospital visits, court visits, and the\nmeager tier exercise time allotted to them. Correspondence privileges with family, friends, and attorneys are, by\nprison rules, the same as those of the general population. However, the record in this case shows a number of\ninstances in which the privacy of such correspondence has been violated. Inmates may not leave the cell for\nacademic or vocational purposes and while cell-study courses with individual teachers are available, in practice\nthis privilege has not worked out well and any educational benefits acquired have come from correspondence\ncourses and individual reading. Plaintiffs (except Pinell) have availed themselves of a number of such high school\nand college level courses. Plaintiffs Talamantez and Johnson completed high school while in segregation. Books\nand periodicals of all types, except materials which contain a call for violence (Cal.Pen.Code § 2600) or which\nare legally obscene (Cal.Pen.Code § 311) are permitted. Many of the plaintiffs have large amounts of\n543 \"revolutionary\" literature in their cells. While possession of *543 such material is clearly permissible, plaintiffs in\nfact get \"docked\" therefor in their Committee and Adult Authority write-ups.\nThere is substantial conflict between the prisoners and the correctional authorities on the adequacy of the heating\nand ventilating system. The evidence indicates that the AC is heated with each cell having a 10\" × 6\" heat and\nventilation opening on the rear wall through which the air is circulated. Though the temperature inside the AC is\ncontrolled by a thermostat, plaintiffs complain of excessive cold and excessive heat at different times, in part\ncaused by broken windows on the first tier that often remain unrepaired for months.\nThe cleaning of cells is left to each inmate and the floor of the cell corridor is regularly swept and washed by\n[11]\nprison staff.  Plaintiffs complain, and the evidence supports their complaints, that the cells, which are without\ndrains, are often flooded by water from broken pipes, stopped up toilets or overflowing basins, as well as by\nwater which cascades from upper tiers. Reasoning that brushes, mops, cleansers and detergents could be\nconverted (and have been converted in the past) into instruments of assault, guards deny (and probably\njustifiably so) these aids both for flood cleanups and ordinary housekeeping chores.\nA female psychiatrist, a physician, a counselor, and a medical paraprofessional are presently assigned to the AC.\nThe custodial staff consists of a program administrator, a unit lieutenant, a sergeant, and twelve correctional\nofficers, two of whom are black and two of whom have Spanish surnames. While officers receive from two to five\nweeks of instruction in officer training academies, as well as orientation and in-service training at the prison, the\ncourt seriously doubts, based on the record in this case, that such training adequately alerts the officers to the\nsensitivities, dangers, despair, and background of the various groups of inmates. One detects a definite\natmosphere of tension between officers and inmates in which hostility, resentment, frustration, despair, and fear\npredominate as the controlling emotional reactions.\n\nMovement of inmates at the AC, except in emergencies, occurs only during the second watch, from 8 a. m. to 4\np. m. Inmates are permitted to take tier exercise (in the corridor), one prisoner at a time, one hour per day, five\ndays a week. However, in practice it actually works out to less than five days a week and often less than one hour\n[12]\nper period. Inmates are never permitted any yard or outdoor privileges or exercise whatsoever.\nThe first tier is separated into four areas, thereby enabling one man to exercise in each tier area at the same\ntime. No search is required prior to exercise. During this exercise period, inmates may pass documents and other\nthings from one person to another, engage in conversation and such recreational activities as chess and\ndominoes. Most inmates use their tier time for such recreational activities and accomplish their exercise by doing\nhundreds of pushups and other exercises within their cells.\nHot showers are scheduled twice a week and the time allotted therefor is fifteen minutes. The water is controlled\nby the guard and some of the plaintiffs have complained that they are not given their full time and often denied\ntheir shower privileges. These incidents, if true, are not of constitutional dimensions. Razors and shaving material\nare made available. Some plaintiffs have complained about forced haircuts and shavings accompanied by acts of\nviolence even during the period of the hearings before this court.\n544 *544 Inmates are permitted out of their cells for one family visit per week and for attorney visits without weekly\n[13]\nlimitation. Plaintiffs average about two attorney visits per week.  During these visits they are at all times\nrequired to wear the white coveralls and are subject to the mechanical restraints of hand manacles, waistbelt, leg\nchains, and neck chains. They are strip searched before and after such visits. Cells may be searched while an\ninmate is out for a visit or showering. Some of these searches have resulted in substantial disarray and even loss\nof inmate possessions. These searches are aimed at preventing contraband and weapons from being circulated\nin the cell block. Weapons are often found in this way.\nFour cells on the first tier are designated as management cells. They are identical in size to regular cells, but\nhave concrete rather than steel bed bunks. Each has a sink and a seatless toilet as in a regular cell. Each of the\nmanagement cells is also equipped with a small anteroom which extends 33 inches from the bars to the corridor.\nThe anteroom has a solid steel front, including a solid steel door. Both the door and front wall have windows\nwhich can be closed by a steel flap. If the inmate persists in loud noises or the throwing of food or debris or\notherwise engages in conduct proscribed by the guards, the door and windows are closed, and the cell becomes\na \"quiet\" cell, which in fact amounts to the equivalent of solitary confinement. The prisoners are not kept in\ndarkness or in the nude. Two cells have only an \"oriental\" hole-in-the-floor type of waste eliminator and have\nbeen called \"strip\" cells. With no wash basin in the strip cells, drinking and cleaning water must be offered hourly.\nHowever, evidence from ex-guards would indicate that this rule is honored more in the breach than in the\nobservance. Presumably, the strip cells are used only as a last resort, usually in cases where an inmate has\ndestroyed the toilet in his regular cell and repeated that destruction in the management cell. All management and\nstrip cells are illuminated by a 200 watt bulb recessed in the rear wall, much as they are in regular cells. However,\nthe light in these cells is controlled by staff from the maintenance alley behind the cell. The management cells are\nused only for disciplinary purposes. Inmates confined in management cells or strip cells retain their issued\nclothing and are given a mattress, blanket, and limited toilet articles.\nPrison regulations promulgated by the Director of Corrections authorizes a prison watch commander to transfer\nan inmate in segregation in the AC to a management cell for unduly disruptive behavior such as loud noises and\nthe throwing of food or debris into the corridor. The length of such confinement is determined by the warden or\nchief disciplinary officer and a review for release must be made daily.\nWith the foregoing knowledge of plaintiffs, the causes of their confinement, their subsequent conduct, the nature\nof the first tier of the AC, and the conditions of confinement therein, the court is in a better position to evaluate the\nindividual claims of plaintiffs and the cumulative impact of those claims.\n\nTHE COURT'S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\nBased upon the record in this case, the testimony of the witnesses (particularly that of former Director of\nCorrections Procunier and that of other correctional officers), the reports that have been made on San Quentin\nand submitted to the court for its consideration, and the court's own inspection of the AC, it is evident that the\n545 continued *545 segregated confinement of plaintiffs to the first tier of the AC not only militates against reform and\nrehabilitation of plaintiffs, but is so counterproductive that it instills in them a deeper hatred for and alienation from\nthe society that initially and justly put them there. Plaintiffs live in an atmosphere of fear and apprehension and\nare confined under degrading conditions without affirmative programs of training or rehabilitation and without\npossible rewards or incentives from the state which will give them a semblance of hope for their transfer out of\nthe AC. The court comes to the conclusion that the continuous segregation of plaintiffs 24 hours a day, except for\nmeager out-of-cell movements and tier exercise; the denial to plaintiffs of fresh air and regular outdoor exercise\nand recreation; the unwarranted and cruel use of tear gas to remove plaintiffs from their cells with its consequent\n[14]\ndangers of injury to plaintiffs or occupants of nearby cells;  and the abhorrent and shocking use of excessive\n[15]\nrestraints in the combined form of hand manacles, waistbelt, leg chains, and neck chains  for all of plaintiffs'\nout-of-prison movements constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n[16]\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n546 *546 The First and Sixth Amendment claims of plaintiffs and all other claims not discussed above, namely, the\nalleged denial of access to effective assistance of counsel, access to the courts, access to the media, invasion of\nprivacy as it relates to plaintiffs' mailing and visiting privileges, lack of medical care and attention, lack of an\nadequate and nutritious diet, and other alleged repressive measures, whether considered individually or\ncollectively, are not supported by the evidence and are not of such constitutional dimensions as to justify\nintervention by a federal court. Though the evidence reveals incidents which have resulted in an invasion of\nplaintiffs' right of privacy in their attorney-client relationship and in their visits with family or friends, no pattern\nemerges which necessitates injunctive relief. It is evident from this very case and the evidence submitted in these\nproceedings that plaintiffs have had and continue to have effective assistance of counsel and access to the\ncourts. Defendants' regulations and practices governing access to the media do not infringe plaintiffs' First and\nFourteenth Amendment freedoms. Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).\nDefendants' handling and censorship of the mails meet with the criteria enunciated in Procunier v. Martinez, 416\nU.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1973). The waiting time for family and attorney visitors is too long.\nHowever, this situation is improving and further steps for improvement have been taken.\nPlaintiffs were found to be in good physical condition following physical examinations by Dr. Kasch and Dr. Oliva\nand psychiatric evaluations disclosed no psychoses. Findings by plaintiffs' doctors and psychiatrists to the\ncontrary, in the court's view, were clearly controverted or at best constitute a difference of medical opinion. The\nallegation of improper use of drugs required competent expert testimony and no such testimony was provided by\nplaintiffs. Some of the plaintiffs have athlete's foot. This is not a medical problem, but rather a matter of personal\nhygiene.\nAlthough the physical plant of San Quentin's Neumiller Hospital is concededly less than desirable, necessary\nmedical services are provided there and use is also made of outlying hospitals. The hospital has a fully equipped\nsurgical suite with recovery rooms, diagnostic x-ray, a clinical laboratory, and pharmacy services. The medical\nrecords, though negligently kept in the past, contain the significant medical information regarding the inmate and\nimprovements in the record keeping process are being instituted.\nThe diet offered plaintiffs at the AC is nutritionally adequate and reasonably well planned. The morning and\nevening meals served to inmates in the AC are exactly the same as those offered to the general population. AC\ninmates also receive a noon meal consisting of a bag lunch 00 two sandwiches and fresh fruit 00 served with\n97 97\ncoffee. Three separate outside evaluations of the AC diet were conducted in response to the action herein: one\nby the Marin County Department of Public Health, one by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, and a\ncomputer study by the University of California Department of Nutritional Sciences. These evaluations showed\nthat national standards of nutrition are being met or exceeded.\n\nWith the exception of plaintiffs' claim that they are confined on the first tier of the AC without benefit of due\nprocess, all other claims of plaintiffs not herein discussed are clearly without merit and hence are rejected by the\ncourt.\nWhile there is evidence in the record to support the claims of plaintiffs that they are confined on the first tier of the\nAC without benefit of due process, the court does not now pass on these claims since any future disciplinary\naction taken against these plaintiffs or any other prisoner at San Quentin must conform to the minimum standards\n547 set forth by the *547 Ninth Circuit in Clutchette v. Procunier, 497 F.2d 809,modified510 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1975),\ncert. granted, 421 U.S. 1010, 95 S.Ct. 2414, 44 L.Ed.2d 678 (1975), unless those standards are modified by the\nSupreme Court.\nDefendants' vague assertions that plaintiffs are revolutionary, disruptive, destructive, militant, aggressive or\nviolent and their specifically asserted primary claim that plaintiffs must be held in the AC until the termination of\nthe Marin County Superior Court trial (on charges as to which they are presumed to be innocent), fail to constitute\na rational security related justification for the continued confinement of plaintiffs in the AC.\nTherefore, in accordance with the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth above,\nIt is ordered:\n1. That unless within 30 days of actual or constructive notice of the entry of judgment in this case,\nor within 10 days of the termination of the criminal proceedings against plaintiffs presently being\nconducted in the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Marin,\nwhichever occurs first, plaintiffs Johnny Spain, Fleeta Drumgo, Luis Talamantez, David Johnson,\nand Hugo Pinell are accorded a properly noticed disciplinary hearing with the due process\nprotections prescribed by the Ninth Circuit in Clutchette v. Procunier, 497 F.2d 807, as modified in \n510 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1975), defendants shall release said plaintiffs to the general population of a\nprison to be selected by the prison authorities;\n2. That absent an actual or imminent threat of death or bodily harm or escape, an actual and\nimminent threat of serious damage to a substantial amount of valuable property, or an actual or\nincipient riot involving a large number of unconfined inmates, the use of tear gas against inmates\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment and defendants and all their successors in office shall\nimmediately and hereafter desist and refrain from the use of tear gas or other harmful chemical\nagents against plaintiffs except in the above enumerated circumstances;\n3. That the use of neck chains constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and defendants and their\nsuccessors in office shall immediately and hereafter desist and refrain from the use of neck chains\nagainst plaintiffs;\n4. That the use of other mechanical restraints other than handcuffs constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment unless an inmate acts in such a violent or otherwise dangerous manner as to present\nan actual or imminent threat of bodily harm or escape and defendants and their successors in\noffice shall immediately and hereafter desist and refrain from the use of other mechanical\nrestraints, except handcuffs, against plaintiffs except in the above enumerated circumstances;\n5. That the denial of fresh air and regular outdoor exercise and recreation constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment and that, weather permitting and absent emergencies occasioned by a riot or\nother unusual circumstances, defendants and their successors in office shall immediately and\nhereafter accord plaintiffs the privilege of at least one hour a day of outdoor exercise or recreation\nfor five days a week, or the equivalent thereof upon proper notice, unless such privilege is denied\na plaintiff for a period not to exceed ten consecutive days after a noticed disciplinary hearing with\nappropriate due process protections;\n6. That the petition of counsel for plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs shall be set for hearing\nbefore the court upon the giving of proper notice; and\n548\n\n[17]\n*548 7. That this court shall retain jurisdiction of this case until the further order of the court.\n[1] This amended complaint was filed by counsel substituted for plaintiffs who had theretofore acted in pro per in\nthis action.\n[2] The California State Bar Committee on Criminal Justice has recently completed a three-year study of state\nprison sentencing, the prison system, and prison release procedures, which appears in September/October 1975\nissue of the California State Bar Journal, Vol. 50 No. 5, wherein at page 361 the Committee reports in part:\n\"Folsom and San Quentin are disgraceful dungeons; Vacaville and Soledad are wholly inadequate places to\nhouse human beings. It is clear to the Committee that the physical facilities of these institutions are incompatible\nwith fundamental and minimal standards of decency and humanity.\"\n[3] courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional rights of all `persons,' [which] includ[es]\nprisoners.\" Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972).\n\"If [the State] is going to operate a Penitentiary System, it is going to have to be a system that is countenanced\nby the Constitution . . .\" Holt v. Sarver, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385 (E.D.Ark., 1970).\n[4] Plaintiffs were jointly indicted by the Marin County Grand Jury on October 1, 1971, upon three counts of\nmurder of correctional officers, two counts of murder of other inmates, and one count of conspiracy to escape,\nkidnap and possess a weapon. They were also indicted in several separate counts charging aggravated assault\nupon three other officers. The indictment grew out of an incident at San Quentin on August 21, 1971, in which\nthree correctional officers and two inmates were slain. Director Procunier testified that the incident of August 21,\n1971, was the worst in his eight years as Director of Corrections.\n[5] Upon termination of the Marin County trial, whether by conviction, acquittal, or dismissal, the Classification\nCommittee of the Prison must again review all information applicable to plaintiffs and determine appropriate\nplacement for them.\n[6] The AC, which began operation in 1960, was originally conceived as a center for concentrated treatment\nprograms for prisoners confined there. Unfortunately, it never achieved its objective. The report of the Assembly\nSelect Committee on Prison Reform and Rehabilitation, entitled Administrative Segregation in California Prisons,\nbetter known as the Karabian Report, issued in September, 1973, states in part: \nThese conditions were never realized. The Department of Corrections not only stumbled in achieving their\nobjective, but fell flat on their face. The adjustment centers have been recognized for what they are . . ..\n\"Segregation and isolation units\" (the \"hole\") were merely relabeled \"adjustment centers\" with temporary and\nlong-term residents classified into \"acute\" and \"chronic\" cases by \"adjustment committees.\" Id. at 2-3.\n[7] By contrast, the general population cells are smaller (4½ × 11' × 7½), are occupied by two inmates, and do\nnot have not water.\n[8] Plaintiffs Johnson and Talamantez agree that because the first tier is a closed floor rather than an open tier\nfacility, the noise level on the first tier is probably lower than that found on most other cell blocks. Plaintiffs' expert,\nZimbardo, agrees that the regular AC cells are not the physical equivalent of solitary confinement.\n[9] These cells on the first floor of the AC, like those on the upper floors, formerly were equipped with a small\ndesk and stool and steel storage cabinet with shelves. Prison authorities assert that these furnishings either were\ndestroyed by the inmates or were removed to prevent their destruction or misuse by the inmates.\n[10] Adjustment Center prisoners get only two hot meals a day and a bag lunch whereas mainliners get three hot\nmeals each day.\n[11] Plaintiff Spain testified that there are no rats in the AC.\n[12] Inmates on the second and third floor of the AC are permitted two and one-half hours of outdoor exercise\nthree times per week in groups numbering up to 17.\n\n[13] Plaintiffs were permitted to have their attorneys and experts inspect the AC and review their central, medical,\nand psychiatric records. Medical examinations and psychiatric interviews by both plaintiffs' and defendants'\nexperts were ordered. The court also permitted plaintiffs to meet with their attorneys in group conferences. More\nthan twenty such conferences were permitted in the course of these proceedings.\n[14] The court rejects defendants' contention that at times the only expedient method of removing a prisoner with\nsafety from his cell is by the use of tear gas or chemical agents such as mace. Defendants have failed to\nestablish any justification for their use based on a reasonable concern for the security of the institution. Tear gas\nand other chemical agents are dangerous, inflict pain, and can cause permanent injury and even death. They are\ncorporal punishment, and absent clear and present dangers of riotous proportions, can never be justified when\nused against individual prisoners in their cells. The use of such chemicals in closed places, such as the AC,\nwhere the chemicals affect not only the target, but neighboring prisoners as well, imposes punishment upon\nprisoners who are innocent of even alleged wrongdoing and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation\nof the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp.\n621 (E.D.Va.1971); Battle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (E.D.Okl.1974).\n[15] The use of restraints on prisoners not actively posing a threat to the security of the institution imposes a\nburden on the prisoners not warranted by the interests of the institution. Manacles, shackles, waistbelts, leg and\nneck chains are painful devices which inflict corporal punishment on those wearing them. They engender pain,\nhumiliation, rage, and resentment to the point where the use of such restraints is counterproductive to any\nlegitimate penal purpose and is destructive to the prisoners. The cruel and unusual character of the punishment\nresulting from the combined restraints employed was clearly evident from the court room demonstration in the\ncourse of the hearings in this case. No possible justification was presented for the use of the neck chain and its\nuse for any purpose whatsoever constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Subjecting plaintiffs to the combined\nuse of manacles, waistbelt, leg chains, and neck chains during their out-of-cell movements makes it impossible\nfor those restrained to demonstrate that they are capable of handling themselves without them. Nothing can be\nmore degrading and dehumanizing than to force a prisoner to visit his mother or other family member under such\nrestraints.\n[16] The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the State of\nCalifornia through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660,\n82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). As the Supreme Court noted in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-01, 78\nS.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1957), the words of the Amendment \"cruel and unusual\" are not precise and their\nscope is not static. \"The Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark\nthe progress of a maturing society.\" As noted in Holt v. Sarver, 309 F.Supp. 362,supra at 380: \nThe term cannot be defined with specificity. It is flexible and tends to broaden as society tends to pay more\nregard to human decency and dignity and becomes, or likes to think that it becomes, more humane. Generally\nspeaking, a punishment that amounts to torture, or that is grossly excessive in proportion to the offense for which\nit is imposed, or that is inherently unfair, or that is unnecessarily degrading, or that is shocking or disgusting to\npeople of reasonable sensitivity is a \"cruel and unusual\" punishment. And a punishment that is not inherently\ncruel and unusual may become so by reason of the manner in which it is inflicted.\n[17] This suit was not brought as a class action and hence the injunctive relief granted is enforceable only as it\napplies to the named plaintiffs (Cf. Board of School Commissioners v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43\nL.Ed.2d 74 (1975). It is anticipated, however, that defendants will apply the order to the conditions of confinement\nand treatment of all inmates at the Adjustment Center at San Quentin, thereby obviating the necessity of invoking\nthe continuing jurisdiction of the court to afford relief to such other inmates. Upon proper motion this action could\nhave been readily maintained as a class action for (1) plaintiffs are representative of all inmates at the Adjustment\nCenter at San Quentin; (2) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members was impracticable; (3) there are,\nas the record clearly indicates, questions of law and fact common to the class; (4) the claims of the plaintiffs are\ntypical of the claims of the class; (5) the plaintiffs have fairly and adequately protected the interests of the class;\nand (6) the adjudications herein made with respect to the named plaintiffs are as a practical matter dispositive of\nthe interests of all inmates at the Adjustment Center at San Quentin not parties to this litigation.

PROCUNIER et al., Defendants-Appellants.\nNo. 76-1095.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.\nMay 30, 1979.\nAs Amended June 15, 1979.\nAs Amended on Denial of Rehearing July 30, 1979.\n119901 *190*191 Sanford Svetcov, Chief Asst. U. S. Atty., San Francisco, Cal., for defendants-appellants.\nFred J. Hiestand, Berkeley, Cal., for plaintiffs-appellees.\n[*]\nBefore DUNIWAY and KENNEDY, Circuit Judges, and PALMIERI,  District Judge.\nKENNEDY, Circuit Judge:\nSix prisoners in the California state prison at San Quentin brought this suit to establish that conditions of their\nconfinement and certain practices directed against them by prison guards were in violation of the cruel and\nunusual punishment clause of the Constitution. U. S. Const. amend. VIII. The action was commenced in the\n192 United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Director of *192 the California\nDepartment of Corrections, the Warden and Associate Warden of the prison, and three prison correctional\nofficers. Judge Zirpoli conducted a 29-day trial and made a personal inspection of the prison to determine the\nfacts of the case. He rejected certain major claims of the plaintiffs, but found that their constitutional rights had\nbeen violated in significant respects. The trial judge permitted the defendants to correct the deficiencies and\nallowed them an opportunity to report on their progress, but when these rulings proved inadequate for the\nprotection of the plaintiffs, he issued an injunction ordering certain corrective actions. The order is supported by\nan extensive opinion, Spain v. Procunier, 408 F.Supp. 534 (N.D.Cal.1976). The defendants appeal. We think the\nopinion should be affirmed in part, and modified or reversed in other respects, all as set forth further below.\nThe case is difficult because it requires us to pass upon measures adopted by prison officials for the safe custody\nof some of the most dangerous men in the prison population. Each of these plaintiffs had been either charged or\nconvicted of violent acts while in prison even before an outbreak of further violence on August 21, 1971. On that\ndate, it is alleged, each of the prisoners had responsibility in some degree for crimes in which three prison\nofficers and two inmates were slain. As the trial court stated, \"Director Procunier testified that the incident of\nAugust 21, 1971 was the worst in his eight years as Director of Corrections.\" 408 F.Supp. at 538 n.4. The\nplaintiffs here were jointly indicted for that incident upon various charges depending on their degree of alleged\nparticipation, and the indictment contained three counts of murder of correctional officers, two counts of murder of\nother inmates, one count of conspiracy to escape, kidnap and possess a weapon, and counts of aggravated\nassault upon three other officers.\nThe prisoners were assigned to the adjustment center (known as the AC) at San Quentin Prison. The AC is a\nthree-story structure used primarily to segregate and discipline disruptive prisoners. Prison regulations directed a\nclassification committee to determine, after an alleged criminal offense committed by a prisoner in custody had\nbeen referred to the district attorney for prosecution, whether the inmate should be segregated from the rest of\nthe prison population during the pendency of the criminal proceedings. The committee had assigned all of these\nprisoners to the AC. Some of the prisoners had been assigned there prior to the August 21, 1971 incident, and\nvarious justifications were offered for their continued detention in that facility, but the trial court found that the\nAugust 21, 1971 incident was the principal reason for holding the plaintiffs in the AC continuously from that date\n\n[1]\nto the date of trial.  Some of the prisoners had been held in the AC for four and one-half years when this action\nwas commenced. The criminal trial for the August 21, 1971 incident had not been completed at that time.\nThe living conditions, sanitary facilities, and daily routine in the AC were described in detail by Judge Zirpoli. He\nconcluded there was no serious deficiency concerning the physical structure and that medical, nutritional, and\nsanitary provisions for the prisoners were adequate. The plaintiffs did not appeal these findings relating to the AC,\nand they did not appeal findings adverse to them on numerous first and sixth amendment claims, such as alleged\ndenial of access to effective assistance of counsel.\nThe respects in which the district court found constitutional deficiencies are: the procedure used to assign\nprisoners to the AC, the use of tear gas, the use of mechanical restraints, including neck chains, and the failure to\n193 provide inmates in the AC with any outdoor exercise. The defendants *193 appeal these rulings. After certain\npreliminary matters, we address each of these subjects below.\nThree-Judge Court\nAppellants first argue that the district court's action required a three-judge court. The former statute, 28 U.S.C. §\n2281, which was repealed in 1976, Pub. L.No. 94-381, 90 Stat. 1119, required the convening of a three-judge\ncourt to enjoin \"the enforcement, operation or execution of any State statute . . . or of an order made by an\nadministrative board or commission acting under State statutes.\" However, the Supreme Court recognized many\nyears ago that the three-judge court is \"a serious drain upon the federal judicial system,\" Phillips v. United States,\n312 U.S. 246, 250, 61 S.Ct. 480, 483, 85 L.Ed. 800 (1941), and directed that the earlier statute, former 28 U.S.C.\n§ 380, upon which section 2281 was based, be narrowly construed, id. at 250-51, 61 S.Ct. 480. In Baxter v.\nPalmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976), the Supreme Court held that a complaint does\nnot meet the threshold requirements of section 2281 jurisdiction and therefore does not necessitate a three-judge\ncourt if it does \"not mention or challenge any rule or regulation of the Authority; nor [does] it seek an injunction\nagainst the enforcement of any identified rule.\" Id. at 313 n.2, 96 S.Ct. at 1555 n.2. See Morales v. Turman, 430\nU.S. 322, 97 S.Ct. 1189, 51 L.Ed.2d 368 (1977) (per curiam); Costello v. Wainwright, 430 U.S. 325, 97 S.Ct.\n1191, 51 L.Ed.2d 372 (1977) (per curiam). In this case, the complaint did not challenge or seek to enjoin any rule\nor regulation; all that was challenged were the practices of appellants as directed toward the plaintiffs. In Morales\nv. Turman, supra, the Court specifically held that constitutional challenges to \"generalized, unwritten practices of\nadministration\" do not require a three-judge court. 430 U.S. at 323, 97 S.Ct. at 1190. Therefore, the case did not\nrequire a three-judge district court.\nProcedural Rights\nThe trial court ordered that unless the appellees were \"accorded a properly noticed disciplinary hearing with the\ndue process protections prescribed by the Ninth Circuit in Clutchette v. Procunier, 497 F.2d 809, as modified in\n510 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1975), [rev'd sub nom. Enomoto v. Clutchette, 425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d\n810 (1976), vacated in part, 536 F.2d 305 (9th Cir. 1976)]\" they were to be released from the AC and permitted to\nrejoin the general population of the prison. 408 F.Supp. at 547. We reverse and remand this order for\nreconsideration in light of the Supreme Court decisions in Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49\nL.Ed.2d 466 (1976), and Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 444, 46 L.Ed.2d 384 (1976). See Johnson v.\nDuffy, 588 F.2d 740 (9th Cir. 1978).\nTear Gas\nThe plaintiffs sought to prohibit prison personnel from using tear gas against them. It was alleged that this painful\nsubstance was used to remove recalcitrant prisoners from their cells and that the use of the chemical caused\nanguish to prisoners in adjacent cells even if they were not the ones refusing to cooperate with prison officials.\nThe principal position taken by the state, both on this question and as to all other substantive matters raised in\nthe appeal, is that federal judicial interference in prison management is not justified on the facts of this case. The\n\nfederal courts should use great restraint before issuing orders based on the finding that the state has followed\nunlawful procedures in discharging the unenviable task of keeping dangerous men in safe custody under humane\nconditions. This said, it must also be remembered that enforcement of the eighth amendment is not always\nconsistent with allowing complete deference to all administrative determinations by prison officials. Whatever\nrights one may lose at the prison gates, cf. Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners Union, 433 U.S. 119, 97 S.Ct.\n194 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977) (prisoners have no right *194 to unionize), the full protections of the eighth\namendment most certainly remain in force. The whole point of the amendment is to protect persons convicted of\ncrimes. Eighth amendment protections are not forfeited by one's prior acts. Mechanical deference to the findings\nof state prison officials in the context of the eighth amendment would reduce that provision to a nullity in precisely\nthe context where it is most necessary. The ultimate duty of the federal court to order that conditions of state\nconfinement be altered where necessary to eliminate cruel and unusual punishments is well established. See Bell\nv. Wolfish, ___ U.S. ___, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 685, 98 S.Ct.\n2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); Newman v. Alabama, 559 F.2d 283, 286 (5th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,438 U.S. 915,\n98 S.Ct. 3144, 57 L.Ed.2d 1160 (1978); Williams v. Edwards, 547 F.2d 1206, 1211-12 (5th Cir. 1977); Inmates of\nAttica Correctional Facility v. Rockefeller, 453 F.2d 12, 22-23 (2d Cir. 1971). In this regard we recognize that an\nequitable decree should not go further than necessary to eliminate the particular constitutional violation which\nprompted judicial intervention in the first instance. See, e. g., Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406,\n420, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977). This case involves no undertaking to change major correctional\npolicies, but it is rather an evaluation of a claim that the state has followed unlawful procedures in some `aspects\nof its day-to-day treatment of these particular prisoners. The trial court made it clear that its orders, both as to\ntear gas and as to all other relief granted, pertained only to the state's treatment of the named plaintiffs in this\ncase. Federal intervention was thereby limited. We must recognize, however, that if the court has imposed these\nrestraints on the handling of the most dangerous men in the system, its decision will inevitably be viewed as an\nimportant precedent for setting standards of treatment for inmates in most other circumstances.\nWe examine the court's order restricting the use of tear gas with these principles in mind. There was some\nevidence in the record that one prisoner had died from tear gas inhalation in the prison, Transcript vol. 10 at 851,\nbut the trial court made no findings as to that incident. The court also did not make findings as to the dates or\nnumber of times in which tear gas had been used improperly against the plaintiffs, but the defendants\nacknowledge occasional use of tear gas to remove these prisoners from their cells when they were recalcitrant.\nThe trial court focused its attention on technical testimony concerning the properties and physiological effects of\ntear gas. An expert in pharmacology testified on these matters. He explained that tear gas can be lethal in the\nconfines of a small cell, such as in the adjustment center. The amount of tear gas used and the extent of\nexposure are critical factors in measuring the dangers of this weapon. Tear gas in the AC was dispensed from\neither a tear gas billy or a dust projector. The billy contained well below a lethal dose, even when used in a\nconfined area. The dust projector, however, contained what appellants admitted is close to a lethal dose. The\ndistrict judge concluded that\n[t]ear gas and other chemical agents are dangerous, inflict pain, and can cause permanent injury\nand even death. . . The use of such chemicals in closed places, such as the AC, where the\nchemicals affect not only the target, but neighboring prisoners as well, imposes punishment upon\nprisoners who are innocent of even alleged wrongdoing . . . .\n408 F.Supp. at 545 n.14. The district court enjoined state prison officials from using tear gas, against these\nplaintiffs, unless there is an \"actual or imminent threat of death or bodily harm or escape, an actual or imminent\nthreat of serious damage to a substantial amount of valuable property, or an actual or incipient riot involving a\nlarge number of unconfined inmates.\" 408 F.Supp. at 547. For the reasons discussed below we think this part of\nthe district court's order should be vacated and remanded.\n195 The state argues that federal intervention on the subject is not justified, *195 but evidence supports the trial\ncourt's finding that the defendants made unwarranted use of this painful and dangerous substance as a matter of\npractice, and under that finding we think a constitutional violation has been established. The parties advance\ncontrary contentions concerning the standard imposed by the district court for future tear gas use, the plaintiffs\ndefending the court's use of an immediate danger test and the state arguing for a more flexible test that permits\n\nuse of the substance where there is a reasonable probability of danger. We think both arguments lack a\nnecessary predicate since neither is related to the amount of the substance or extent of exposure. Neither the\ncourt's findings nor the record establishes that the substance is dangerous in every quantity. In those\ncircumstances in which, given the probable extent of exposure, the quantity used is dangerous, then the\nconditions for its use set forth by the district court are necessary to implement eighth amendment protections.\nThe infliction of pain and the danger of serious harm may be necessary if there is a threat of an equal or greater\nharm to others, as is reflected in the doctrine of self defense which permits one to do harm to another person who\nthreatens unlawfully to do an equal or greater harm to another. See R. Perkins, Criminal Law 995 (1969).\nInherent in the doctrine of self defense is the concept of proportion. If then the tear gas is used in dangerous\nquantities, we agree with the district court that its use is justified only in those grave circumstances which would\njustify the use of severe and potentially lethal force.\nWe think the record further indicates, however, that use of the substance in small amounts may be a necessary\nprison technique if a prisoner refuses after adequate warning to move from a cell or upon other provocation\npresenting a reasonable possibility that slight force will be required. In these circumstances the substance may\nbe a legitimate means for preventing small disturbances from becoming dangerous to other inmates or the prison\npersonnel. We infer that the trial court was concerned that even if tear gas might legitimately be used in small\nquantities for this purpose, there might be a temptation, from a desire to punish a particular group or segment of\ninmates, to cause discomfort to prisoners who occupy adjacent cells. We share that concern and do not sanction\nthe use of tear gas as punishment, but in our view the order should be modified in certain respects.\nUse of tear gas has been sanctioned by other courts, See Bethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 509 (10th Cir. 1969); \nLandman v. Peyton, 370 F.2d 135, 138 n.2 (4th Cir. 1966),cert. denied,388 U.S. 920, 87 S.Ct. 2142, 18 L.Ed.2d\n1367 (1967); Washington v. Anderson, 387 F.Supp. 412, 414 (E.D.Okl.1974); Collins v. Schoonfield, 363 F.Supp.\n1152, 1164-65 (D.Md.1973); Poindexter v. Woodson, 357 F.Supp. 443, 456 (D.Kan.1973),aff'd510 F.2d 464\n(10th Cir.),cert. denied,423 U.S. 846, 96 S.Ct. 85, 46 L.Ed.2d 68 (1975); cf. Commission on Accreditation for\nCorrections, Manual of Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions, § 4165 at 32 (1977) (\"Chemical agents\nshould be used only at the direction of the chief executive officer or delegated subordinate\"), but after an\nexamination of those cases we think it fair to say that those holdings were not shaped or formed by expert\ntestimony such as that presented in this case. Those courts did not consider evidence, such as that presented to\nthe trial court in this case, that use of the substance can be extremely dangerous. For example, in Bethea v.\nCrouse, supra, the court without any analysis of the effects of tear gas simply asserted that it was \"a purely\ndisciplinary measure\" and that \"no reasonable man would say that it [the use of tear gas] amounted to cruel and\nunusual punishment.\" 417 F.2d at 509. And in Landman v. Peyton, 370 F.2d at 138 n.3, the court specifically\nnoted that it was not presented any evidence concerning possible complications from overexposure to tear gas\nand strongly implied that such evidence might have affected its decision. A number of other courts have,\nhowever, condemned the use of tear gas in particular circumstances as violative of the eighth amendment or of\n196 due process or both. See, e.g., Greear v. Loving, 538 F.2d 578, 579-80 *196 (4th Cir. 1976); Morris v. Travisono,\n528 F.2d 856, 858-59 (1st Cir. 1976); Patterson v. MacDougall, 506 F.2d 1, 3, 5 (5th Cir. 1975); McCargo v.\nMister, 462 F.Supp. 813, 818-19 (D.Md.1978); LeGrande v. Redman, 423 F.Supp. 524, 526-28 (D.Del.1976); \nBattle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402, 423, 433-34 (E.D.Okl.1974); Morales v. Turman, 364 F.Supp. 166, 170,\n173-74, 176 (E.D.Tex.1973) (preliminary injunction), granting permanent injunctive relief, 383 F.Supp. 53, 73-74,\n77 (E.D.Tex.1974), rev'd on other grounds, 535 F.2d 864 (5th Cir.1976), rev'd,430 U.S. 322, 97 S.Ct. 1189, 51\nL.Ed.2d 368 (1977),remanded on other grounds,562 F.2d 993 (5th Cir. 1977).\nWe think it makes little sense to say that use of tear gas can never be a violation of the eighth amendment. In \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), the Court stated the eighth amendment\nprohibits those punishments which \"are incompatible with `the evolving standards of decency that mark the\nprogress of a maturing society,'\" id. at 102, 97 S.Ct. at 290 (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct.\n590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958)), or which \"`involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,'\" 429 U.S. at 103,\n97 S.Ct. at 290 (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976)). We agree\nwith the trial court that use of potentially dangerous quantities of the substance is justified only under narrowly\ndefined circumstances, but we further conclude that use of nondangerous quantities of the substance in order to\nprevent a perceived future danger does not violate \"evolving standards of decency\" or constitute an\n\"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" Therefore, where there are safeguards to insure that tear gas is not\n\nused in dangerous quantities we think its use can be justified in situations which are reasonably likely to result in\ninjury to persons or a substantial amount of valuable property, and that use of potentially dangerous quantities is\nappropriately reserved for the circumstances narrowly defined by the district court in its opinion. We therefore\nremand to the district court for determination of appropriate standards concerning dosage level and manner of\nuse to delineate between dangerous and nondangerous use of the chemical. In addition, we request the court to\nformulate a standard consistent with this opinion so that tear gas may be used in nondangerous quantities if no\nmore convenient or safe control method is available and if feasible steps are taken to protect nonrecalcitrant\ninmates. In so doing, the court may take into account but is not limited to prison regulations on the use of tear\ngas. See 15 Cal.Admin.Code § 3277.\nMechanical Restraints\nDuring their 4½ years of confinement in the AC, the prisoners were required or permitted to leave that facility for\nappointments either within the prison, such as the visitors' area, or outside prison confines, such as for court\nproceedings. Whether their destinations were in the prison or outside it, the plaintiffs were not allowed to leave\nthe AC unless they were restrained by all of these devices: handcuffs; a waist chain or belt to which the cuffs\nwere attached by a chain, hands in front of the prisoner; leg manacles, consisting of loops around each ankle\nconnected by a chain; and a neck chain, consisting of a chain attached to the back of the waist chain and\nextending over one shoulder, across the neck, over the other shoulder and down the back. The neck chain could\nbe pulled from the back to restrain or control a prisoner. Pain and sores resulted from the shackles being\nattached too tightly. While the prisoners remained outside of the AC, these restraining devices, including a neck\nchain, remained fastened for all out-of-cell movements and throughout visits with family, friends, or counsel, but,\napparently, not during court proceedings.\nThe trial court found that use of these devices for all out-of-cell movements was dehumanizing, and that it was\ncruel and unusual punishment. After a period in which the state was given an opportunity to develop some\nmeasures to ameliorate the various conditions the court found violative of minimum standards imposed by the\n197 Constitution, *197 the court granted injunctive relief prohibiting the use of neck chains on the plaintiffs under any\ncircumstances and limiting the use of other restraining devices, stating as follows:\n[T]he use of other mechanical restraints other than handcuffs constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment unless an inmate acts in such a violent or otherwise dangerous manner as to present\nan actual or imminent threat of bodily harm or escape and defendants and their successors in\noffice shall immediately and hereafter desist and refrain from the use of other mechanical\nrestraints, except handcuffs, against plaintiffs except in the above enumerated circumstances. . .\n408 F.Supp. at 547.\nAt the outset, we note the court did not find that any of the defendants put mechanical restraints on the prisoners\nwith the intent to punish them by reason of alleged past crimes against other guards and inmates, although the\npossible existence of this motive to punish is troubling to us, as it may have been to the district court. An intent to\npunish may be one element in deciding whether there has been an eighth amendment violation, since the state of\nmind or purpose of a government official bears on the question of whether imposition of the punishment is a\nnecessary or rational means to a permissible end. However, wrongful intent is not a necessary element for an\neighth amendment violation. If the physical or mental pain that results is cruel and unusual, it is a violation of the\neighth amendment regardless of the intent or purpose of those who inflict it. Here the trial court found a violation\nof the eighth amendment because the restraints imposed on the prisoners during out-of-cell movements were\nexcessive, painful, and degrading. The record supports that finding. We think, however, the remedy ordered by\nthe court should be modified in certain respects.\nWe affirm the order that defendants cease using neck chains on the plaintiffs while they remain within the prison.\nWe do not say that use of a neck chain is always cruel and unusual punishment. The necessity for subjecting a\nprisoner to a painful device is one measure of its cruelty, see Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 279, 92 S.Ct.\n2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring), and the record here discloses that even if a prisoner is\nmanacled hand and foot, it may be possible for him to lunge out and cause serious injury to other persons. In this\n\ncase we think the trial court's order prohibiting use of neck chains was justified, not because neck chains are in\nthemselves always cruel, but because their use on these plaintiffs for more than a 4½ year period was. While the\ndefendants could point to some isolated instances of anger and threats of imminent violence from some of the\nprisoners, the state did not show that neck chains were necessary for every plaintiff throughout the long period\ncovered by this case. And there appears to be no justification at all for requiring the prisoners to bear the visible\nburdens of neck chains during all visits to family, friends, and counsel throughout this long period.\nThe order was directed only to these plaintiffs. The state can seek modification of the injunction if circumstances\noccur which would make it appear necessary to reinstitute use of this particularly painful restraining device,\nalthough that is unlikely in view of a newly adopted regulation discussed below. We therefore affirm the portion of\nthe court's order relating to use of neck chains for the plaintiffs' movements inside the confines of the prisons.\nWe would be reluctant to say that, given the violent history of these prisoners and the severity of the sentences\nthey face, use of neck chains for the purpose of preventing escape when the prisoners are being transported\noutside the prison confines is to be prohibited regardless of the prevailing disposition or behavior of the prisoner.\nIt appears, however, that the regulation discussed below now prohibits use of neck chains even for out-of-prison\nmovements. Therefore we think it will be sufficient protection for the plaintiffs for the court to issue as to this\naspect of the case an injunction requiring the state to follow its now existing regulation as to these prisoners.\n198 *198 As to the portion of the order reached by the court pertaining to mechanical restraints such as waist chains\nand manacles, we find some difficulties in its interpretation. Aside from the use of neck chains, which was\naltogether prohibited, use of mechanical restraints other than handcuffs was prohibited \"unless an inmate acts in\nsuch a violent or otherwise dangerous manner as to present an actual or imminent threat of bodily harm or\nescape.\" 408 F.Supp. at 547. Under one interpretation, since some or all of these plaintiffs were accused of killing\nthree guards and two inmates, their past conduct would justify one in concluding that they presented an actual\nand imminent threat of future violence for so long as they remained in custody with substantial time yet to serve.\nUnder another interpretation, the restraints could not be imposed until the very moment the inmate attempted a\nfurther violent and dangerous act, in which case it is plain the restraint would be fixed too late. The problem of\ninterpretation becomes especially significant with respect to movements outside the prison confines. Mechanical\nrestraints are no less painful or degrading when used on prisoners taken outside the prison; in fact they may be\nmore degrading since the prisoner is exposed to the general population, who are far less accustomed to seeing\nprisoners. The presence of the shackles may confirm their worst beliefs about felons. Nonetheless, the dangers\npresented when the prisoner travels outside the prison are significant. The closed environment of a prison\npermits monitoring of most activities of the prisoners and those with whom they are in close contact. This same\ndegree of control is simply not possible beyond penitentiary walls. The movement of prisoners outside the prison\ninherently presents a serious threat to their guards and the population at large. Under these circumstances, we\ndo not consider that use of mechanical restraints such as leg manacles or waist chains, in addition to handcuffs,\nis excessive or unreasonable.\nAfter the trial court issued the injunctive orders in this case, the Department of Corrections revised its regulations\npertaining to mechanical restraints. The regulation states as follows:\nMechanical Restraint. (a) Mechanical means of physically restraining an inmate or parolee will be\nused only when reasonably necessary under the following circumstances:\n(1) In transportation.\n(2) Where the past history and present behavior or apparent emotional state of the inmate or\nparolee, or other present conditions that provide a strong motivation to the inmate or parolee to\nengage in violence or escape, create a reasonable likelihood that bodily injury to any person or\nescape will otherwise occur.\n(3) Under medical advice to prevent the inmate or parolee from suicide or self-inflicted serious\nphysical injury.\n(b) Mechanical means of physical restraint will not be used as punishment. No mechanical\nrestraint equipment or device will be placed about the neck of an inmate or parolee, nor will\n\nrestraint equipment be applied in any way so as to inflict physical pain, undue physical discomfort,\nor to restrict blood circulation or breathing. Restraint equipment will not be used to secure an\ninmate or parolee to a stationary object except as a temporary emergency measure. During\ntransportation an inmate or parolee will not be secured by any keyed locking device or equipment\nto any part of the transporting vehicle.\n(c) When mechanical restraint is required, handcuffs, alone or attached to a waist chain, will be\nthe usual method used. Additional mechanical restraint, such as leg irons, additional chains or\nother specialized restraint equipment, is permitted only where it reasonably appears that individual\ncircumstances exist which justify the use of such additional equipment. The individual\ncircumstances justifying the additional mechanical restraint will be documented except in cases\n199 where an inmate is being transported outside the institution. *199 15 Cal.Admin.Code § 3280. We\nthink the regulation is a sensitive statement, which gives compass to those factors that should\ninform any reasonable assessment of whether or not prisoners should be subjected to undue\ndiscomfort or humiliation caused by the restraints. We think it is proper to defer to the expertise of\nthe Department of Corrections by adopting these regulations as the standard for imposing\nmechanical restraints, as to these plaintiffs. The purpose of protecting the plaintiffs against a\nrecurrence of instances where excessive restraints are imposed will be adequately served with\nadequacy by enjoining the defendants to follow the regulation set out above as to each of these\nplaintiffs. This will provide the plaintiffs with a ready means for challenging any perceived violation\nof their constitutional rights and eliminates the requirement that officials follow different policies as\nto these prisoners than with the general prison population. Moreover, the modification eliminates\nproblems of interpretation and application that we have found in the order issued by the district\ncourt.\nOutdoor Exercise\nThe final matter to be considered is the denial of any outdoor exercise to the plaintiffs. The trial court found that\nfor recreation the plaintiffs were permitted to exercise one at a time in a corridor fronting on eight or nine cells.\nExercise periods were set for one hour a day, five days a week, but in practice the exercise times were often far\nshorter than one hour and less frequent than five days a week. During exercise, inmates were permitted to\nconverse with prisoners in adjacent cells and to play chess or dominoes. Inmates on the first floor of the AC were\nnever permitted any outdoor exercise or recreation.\nThe court found \"[t]hat the denial of fresh air and regular outdoor exercise and recreation constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment,\" 408 F.Supp. at 547, and ordered defendants to accord plaintiffs the right of outdoor\nexercise one hour per day, five days a week unless inclement weather, unusual circumstances, or disciplinary\nneeds made that impossible. We affirm that order. In so doing, we do not consider it necessary to decide whether\ndeprivation of outdoor exercise is a per se violation of the eighth amendment. Our ruling, and that of the district\ncourt, applies to these plaintiffs who were assigned to the AC for a period of years.\nThere is substantial agreement among the cases in this area that some form of regular outdoor exercise is\nextremely important to the psychological and physical well being of the inmates.

Landrieu, 351 F.Supp. 549, 550 (E.D.La.1972); Taylor v. Sterrett, 344\nF.Supp. 411, 420 (N.D.Tex. 1972),modified on other grounds,499 F.2d 367 (5th Cir. 1974); Conklin v. Hancock,\n334 F.Supp. 1119, 1122 (D.N.H.1971); Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F.Supp. 1123, 1129-31 (E.D. La.1971); Jones\nv. Wittenberg, 330 F.Supp. 707, 717 (N.D.Ohio 1971),aff'd. sub nom. Jones v. Metzger, 456 F.2d 854 (6th Cir.\n1972); see also, Smith v. Sullivan, 553 F.2d 373, 379 (5th Cir. 1977).\nJudge Zirpoli made an exhaustive examination of all of the conditions to which plaintiffs were subjected and quite\nproperly considered not only the \"individual claims of plaintiffs [but also] . . . the cumulative impact of those\nclaims.\" 408 F.Supp. at 544. Several factors combined to make outdoor exercise a necessity. AC prisoners were\nin continuous segregation, spending virtually 24 hours every day in their cells with only meager out-of-cell\n\nmovements and corridor exercise. Their contact with other persons was minimal. The district court found that\n\"[p]laintiffs live in an atmosphere of fear and apprehension and are confined under degrading conditions without\naffirmative programs of training or rehabilitation and without possible rewards or incentives from the state which\nwill give them a semblance of hope for their transfer out of the AC.\" Id. at 545.\n200 *200 The state argues that outdoor exercise was withheld to protect prison staff and other inmates from violent\nattacks by the plaintiffs, and to protect plaintiffs from attacks by other inmates. The state also cites the objective\nof reducing the risk of escape, a risk which existed with the plaintiffs even under conditions where security was\ngreater than in the prison exercise yard. These concerns justify not permitting plaintiffs to mingle with the general\nprison population but do not explain why other exercise arrangements were not made. The cost or inconvenience\nof providing adequate facilities is not a defense to the imposition of a cruel punishment. Confinement to the AC\nwas not a temporary assignment for these prisoners, and the state has failed to give an adequate justification for\nfailing to provide resources for outdoor exercise during their long period of confinement. In light of all of the\nconditions existing in the AC, it was cruel and unusual punishment for a prisoner to be confined for a period of\nyears without opportunity to go outside except for occasional court appearances, attorney interviews, and\nhospital appointments. In 1975 defendants initiated a program of outdoor exercise for AC inmates. The apparent\nsuccess of this program weakens any claims of impossibility to comply with the trial court's order.\nOn this record the district court did not find that exercise is required for every prisoner given a temporary\nassignment to the AC for disciplinary purposes, and we do not address that question. The district court found that\noutdoor exercise was required for these plaintiffs who were confined to the AC for more than four years. We\naffirm that order and agree with the district court that it will serve an important purpose if its pendency will cause\nthe state to reexamine its exercise policy as to all persons assigned to this facility.\nIn a significant number of criminal cases, such as where the defendant pleads guilty or is relatively certain the\nstate can prove criminal guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, his principal concerns are the sentence and conditions\nof confinement, not a trial to determine guilt or innocence. Yet, by contrast with our determined, even zealous,\nefforts to shape and refine the adjudication process, courts have given little attention to the elementary\nrequirements of the penal system until recent years. In this case most of the prison practices challenged by the\nprisoners including provisions for food, medical care, and physical facilities, withstood challenge. Compare Hutto\nv. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); Williams v. Edwards, 547 F.2d 1206 (5th Cir.\n1977); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974); Inmates of Attica Correctional Facility v. Rockefeller, 453\nF.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1971). In part because these basic programs were sound, the trial court was in a position to\nproperly focus its inquiry on certain specific aspects of the treatment in the adjustment center.\nUnderlying the eighth amendment is a fundamental premise that prisoners are not to be treated as less than\nhuman beings. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 271-73, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Brennan, J.\nconcurring). The amendment is phrased in general terms rather than specific ones so that while the underlying\nprinciple remains constant in its essentials, the precise standards by which we measure compliance with it do\nnot. See Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910). It follows that when\nconfronting the question whether penal confinement in all its dimensions is consistent with the constitutional rule,\nthe court's judgment must be informed by current and enlightened scientific opinion as to the conditions\nnecessary to insure good physical and mental health for prisoners. We think the district court gave proper\nrecognition to this principle in its order requiring outdoor exercise for these plaintiffs.\nThe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n[*] Honorable Edmund L. Palmieri, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] Although plaintiffs were assigned to the AC pending their trials on charges stemming from this incident, this\nopinion is in no way premised on a theory that with respect to those charges the plaintiffs were pretrial detainees.\nSee Bell v. Wolfish, ___ U.S. ___, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). We rely solely on the eighth\namendment in evaluating the plaintiffs' conditions of confinement.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
