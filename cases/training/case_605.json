    "summary": "<p>On Feb. 27, 1990, Colorado inmates filed a class action lawsuit under 42 USC 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The inmates, represented by the ACLU of Colorado, the ACLU National Prison Project and private counsel, challenged the conditions of confinement, particularly overcrowding, in three Colorado state prisons. The three prisons were not included in the 1979 decision and remedial measures in <a href=\"../../../../case/606/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ramos v. Lamm</a> prohibiting overcrowding in three Colorado facilities.</p>\r\n<p>The inmates' complaints alleged that that the totality of conditions at the prisons fell below the standards of human decency, particularly with respect to the overcrowded and unsanitary environment. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that their constitutional rights were being violated, and a comprehensive remedial order to abate permanently the alleged unconstitutional conditions causing the violations. The plaintiff class of all current and future inmates of the facilities was certified on August 16, 1990 over the objection of the defendants.</p>\r\n<p>According to the docket, the matter was consolidated with <a href=\"../../../../case/602/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Diaz v. Romer</a>, Civil Action No. 77-C-1093 for purposes of discovery on October 30, 1990. At some point the matter was also consolidated with Arguello v. Romer, Civil Action No. 88-C-1335.</p>\r\n<p>The parties engaged in substantial discovery, including the employment of expert witnesses to assess the conditions of the prisons. After several months of negotiations, they reached a settlement agreement, which the court (Judge Jim R. Carrigan) approved on June 12, 1992. Diaz v. Romer, 801 F.Supp. 405 (D. Colo. 1992). The Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision on October 21, 1993. Diaz v. Romer, 9 F.3d 116 (10th Cir. 1993).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The agreement specified that in return for final closure of these cases, the defendants would make capital improvements and undertake certain other changes at each of the prisons to insure that conditions of confinement at those facilities met constitutional standards. These improvements included: renovations to the facilities, an end to double bunking for inmates classified in administrative segregation, improvements in sanitation and health care, and expansion of sex offender treatment programs. The agreement also provided for annual peer review by a qualified representative from the American Correctional Association, the National Institute of Corrections, or an independent entity approved by one of those organizations.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement specified that any proceeding to enforce the agreement must be in the form of a new action, and stated the parties' intent that it be enforceable in federal court. The parties stipulated that in the event that no federal jurisdiction existed for a new action, this case could be reopened and the dismissal order vacated for the limited purpose of enforcing the agreement.

A. Nos. 77-C-1093, 90-C-340 and 88-C-1335.\nUnited States District Court, D. Colorado.\nJune 12, 1992.\n406 *406 James Hartley, Denver, Colo., for plaintiffs.\nWilliam Higgins, First Asst. Atty. Gen., Denver, Colo., for defendants.\nORDER\nCARRIGAN, District Judge.\nThe matter is before the Court on the parties' joint motion for approval of the settlement agreements submitted in\nthe above captioned cases. Because these cases involve certified classes, the Court must approve any\nresolution of the outstanding claims of the plaintiff classes under Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe proposed settlement agreements filed in these cases would settle three class action lawsuits challenging the\nconditions of confinement in seven Colorado prisons: Womens, Territorial, Shadow Mountain, Centennial,\nFremont, Buena Vista and Arkansas Valley Correctional Facilities. In return for final closure of these cases, the\ndefendants have agreed to make capital improvements and to undertake certain other changes at each of the\nsubject prisons to insure that conditions of confinement at those facilities meet constitutional standards.\nThe parties submitted their joint motion for approval of the proposed settlement agreements on February 24,\n1992. Pursuant to this Court's order dated March 2, 1992, notice of the proposed settlement agreement was\nprepared by the Clerk of the District Court. Defendants were ordered to post a copy of that notice together with\nthe proposed settlement agreement by March 6, 1992 in every living unit and in each law library of each of the\naffected prisons. Counsel for the defendants have represented to the Court and submitted documentary evidence\nthat defendants have complied with the Court's order.\nPrior to the hearing on April 24, 1992, the Court reviewed the proposed agreements and all of those comments\nand objections received by the Clerk, whether timely filed or not. Appearing at the hearing on behalf of the plaintiff\nclass were their attorneys of record, Messrs. James E. Hartley and Steven W. Black. Also present for the plaintiff\n407 class was Leslie Pagett, a legal *407 assistant with the ACLU. The defendants were represented by their counsel\nof record, Messrs. Paul Farley, Deputy Attorneys General, Anthony Marquez and William Higgins, both First\nAssistant Attorneys General. Frank O. Gunter, Director of the Department of Corrections for the State of\nColorado, was also present at the hearing. The Special Master, The Honorable Steven L.R. McNichols, was\n\npresent and recommended approval of the proposed settlement agreements. Finally, the Court accepted a brief\nfiled on behalf of \"Citizens for Correctional Reform\" as amicus curiae.\nAPPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW\nRule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a class action \"shall not dismissed or\ncompromised without the approval of the court.\" In addition, notice of any proposed settlement must be given to\nall the class members \"in such manner as the court directs.\" The purpose of these requirements is to protect\nclass members whose rights \"may not have been given adequate consideration during the settlement\nnegotiations.\" In re New Mexico Natural Gas Antitrust Litigation, 607 F.Supp. 1491, 1497 (D.Colo.1984). To be\napproved by the Court, a class action settlement must be fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as whole. \nSee id. (discussing factors the court may weigh in making this determination); see also Officers for Justice v. Civil\nService Commission, 688 F.2d 615 (9th Cir.1982). However, a settlement hearing is not a substitute for a trial; the\nCourt's role is much more limited. As explained by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:\n[T]he court's intrusion upon what is otherwise a private consensual agreement negotiated\nbetween the parties to a lawsuit must be limited to the extent necessary to reach a reasoned\njudgment that the agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by, or collusion between,\nthe negotiating parties, and that the settlement, taken as a whole is fair, reasonable and adequate\nto all concerned. Therefore, the settlement or fairness hearing is not to be turned into a trial or\nrehearsal for trial on the merits.... The proposed settlement is not to be judged against\nhypothetical or speculative measure of what might have been achieved by the negotiators.\nOfficers for Justice, 688 F.2d at 625.\nA consensual resolution of a dispute is always preferred. Such consensus can only be founded upon\ncompromise. Thus, the fact that the agreements reached do not address each and every issue raised in the\nComplaint or Motion for Contempt does not in and of itself give cause to question the fairness of the agreements\nor the process involved in reaching them.\nWith these standards in mind, the Court will assess adequacy of notice and the fairness of the proposed\nsettlements in that order.\nADEQUACY OF NOTICE\nMembers of the class were advised that a proposed settlement was submitted to this Court for approval pursuant\nto Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that any inmate who wished to comment on or object\nto the fairness or reasonableness of the proposed settlement agreement must file a written statement with the\nCourt postmarked no later than April 6, 1992. The Clerk of the District Court was directed to receive and file\nwritten comments and objections submitted by the inmates which, in turn, this Court has reviewed.\nNoting that no comments were received from inmates at the Buena Vista Correctional Facility, the Court\nspecifically inquired of defense counsel regarding compliance with the order requiring notice at that facility.\nCounsel, after consultation with Department of Corrections officials present in court, assured the Court that the\nnotices had been posted as ordered, and plaintiffs' counsel do not dispute that adequate notice was given to\ninmates at BVCF.\nIn the only instance where adequacy of notice was contested by members of the plaintiff class, the Court\n408 admitted into evidence with no objection from counsel an affidavit from the housing manager at Colorado *408\nTerritorial Correction Facility (\"CTCF\"), declaring that notice was in fact posted at CTCF from March 6, 1992,\nthrough April 6, 1992, in conformance with the Court's order. In addition, the fact that a number of inmates\nobjected to the proposed settlements is evidence of the effectiveness of notice.\nHaving reviewed the procedure utilized to notify class members of the terms of the proposed settlement, and\nhaving considered all of the objections of the class members, including objections to the adequacy of notice, the\n\nCourt finds that class members have been duly, sufficiently and fairly notified of (1) the terms of the \"Final\nAgreement and Stipulation\" and the \"Agreement for Settlement of Claims\"; (2) the date, time and place of the\nhearing to approve final settlement; and (3) the procedure for bringing comments and/or objections concerning\nthe proposed settlement to the attention of the Court. Accordingly, the thirty day notice and comment period\nprovided pursuant to this Court's order satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure and complied with all applicable due process and other constitutional requirements.\nTERMS OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS\nThe Court accepts both of the agreements as negotiated and written, without modification or exception. By its\ncomments hereafter the Court does not intend to modify the terms of these agreements.\nDiaz v. Romer, Civil Action No. 77-C-1093\nThe \"Final Agreement and Stipulation\" submitted in Diaz is a comprehensive agreement contemplating the final\nclosure of a case that began almost 15 years ago (originally Ramos v. Lamm). In return for the immediate\ndissolution of all previous orders of the Court in this action, and the withdrawal of plaintiffs' pending motion to\nshow cause why defendants should not be held in contempt, defendants have agreed to make capital\nimprovements and to undertake other steps, most notably staffing increases, at the affected prisons no later than\nJune 30, 1994. Except for the limited purpose of enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement, this case will\nbe closed in its entirety and the Court's jurisdiction over the parties will end. For the reasons discussed below, the\nCourt finds that resolution of this proceeding, as set forth in the proposed Final Agreement and Stipulation, is in\nthe best interests of the class members and the ongoing intervention and supervision by the Court is no longer\nnecessary.\nThis proceeding was originally initiated as an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 challenging the conditions of\nconfinement at the facility presently known as Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility (\"CTCF\"). This matter was\ncertified as a class action on March 31, 1978, in accordance with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nThe class now consists of all persons who are now or in the future may be incarcerated at CTCF, Centennial\nCorrectional Facility (\"CCF\"), or Shadow Mountain Correctional Facility (\"SMCF\").\nAfter trial the Court found that the conditions of confinement at CTCF violated the Eighth Amendment's\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. See Ramos v. Lamm, 485 F.Supp. 122 (D.Colo.1979),aff'd in\npart and rev'd in part,639 F.2d 559 (10th Cir.1980),cert. denied,450 U.S. 1041, 101 S.Ct. 1759, 68 L.Ed.2d 239\n(1981),on remand, 520 F.Supp. 1059 (D.Colo. 1981). To remedy the unconstitutional conditions, the Court\ndirected the state defendants to implement certain changes in the operations of the prison. For the protection of\nthe class, the Court's orders were made applicable to the three facilities presently at issue.\nAfter a series of early remedial orders, the parties entered into a Consent Order dated August 7, 1985 requiring\nthe defendants to comply with numerous provisions in the operation of the three facilities. At the time of entry of\nthat order, it was the intent of the parties and the Court that, \"Provided that defendants are substantially in\ncompliance herewith, this consent order, and defendants' obligations hereunder, shall terminate, and the case\n409 shall be *409 deemed closed, 18 months after the order is entered by the Clerk of the Court\" (para. 1(c), p. 2 of\n1985 Consent Order). In determining whether the purposes of that Order have been achieved, the Court must\nconsider the parties' intent when the consent decree was entered. Kendrick v. Bland, 659 F.Supp. 1188\n(W.D.Ky.1987). The parties having initially agreed to the terms of a consent decree, great weight should be given\nto a subsequent agreement of those parties that the purposes of the original decree have been accomplished.\nSince the entry of the 1985 Consent Order, plaintiffs, through class counsel, have continued to investigate and\nmonitor conditions at the three facilities, and defendants' compliance with the Court's orders. For example, in late\n1986 and early 1987 plaintiffs arranged for certain experts to inspect the three facilities in order to evaluate\ndefendants' compliance with the Court's directives. In late 1988 and early 1989, plaintiffs conducted substantial\ndiscovery, including document production and depositions of Department of Corrections personnel, regarding the\nissue of the defendants' compliance with the Court's directives. Joint experts in the areas of security, physical\n\nplant conditions, mental health, and medical and nursing care have inspected the three Ramos facilities semi-\nannually to monitor conditions of confinement and evaluate compliance with the consent decrees. Finally,\nplaintiffs have conducted substantial additional discovery in connection with their contempt motion filed in early\n1990. Class counsel have thoroughly investigated their case and clearly are in the position to evaluate the risk of\nfurther litigation compared to the benefits to the plaintiff class offered in settlement.\nFurthermore, since this matter was assigned to this Court approximately 5 years ago, this Court has had\noccasion to decide disputes arising in the context of this action (i.e., housing of HIV positive inmates, order of\nSept. 12, 1990). By virtue of this contact the Court has become personally familiar with the operations of the\nDepartment of Corrections as a whole, these three facilities in particular, and the policies and staff involved. This\nCourt has also had numerous opportunities to observe and assess the legal skill and acumen of class counsel\nduring these various proceedings and is confident that these class members have received competent\nrepresentation in this action.\nThe proposed settlement addresses many of the concerns identified in the plaintiffs' contempt motion and\ncontemplates the conclusion of court supervision. Among other things, the defendants have agreed to hire a full-\ntime medical director and an additional full-time psychiatrist; hire 48 additional correctional and health care staff;\nrenovate Cell House 3 at CTCF; refrain from double bunking at CCF and SMCF for a minimum of 2 years;\ninstitute double bunking at CTCF only if additional staff are hired to provide supplemental activities and services;\nestablish a \"CMI Unit\" at CCF to provide mental health care for chronically mentally ill inmates. These benefits\nwill inure to the benefit of class members at all three of the Diaz facilities. The Court agrees with the parties that\nthe purposes of the previous Court orders have been achieved and no need exists to continue judicial\nsupervision of the three Diaz facilities.\nNolasco v. Romer, Civil Action No. 90-C-340, and Arguello v. Romer,\nCivil Action No. 88-C-1335\nThese class action lawsuits challenge the conditions of confinement at four Colorado state prisons. The Nolasco\ncase alleges unconstitutional conditions at Colorado Womens Correctional Facility, Buena Vista Correctional\nFacility and Fremont Correctional Facility (the \"Three Prisons,\" or respectively, \"CWCF,\" \"BVCF\" and \"FCF\"). The \nArguello case alleges similar unconstitutional conditions at Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility (\"AVCF\"). The\nplaintiffs have twice amended their complaints and the defendants have twice answered. The plaintiff classes\nhave been certified by the Court and the cases consolidated.\nUnlike the Diaz case, the Nolasco and Arguello actions have not proceeded to trial. No evidence has been heard\n410 or ruling made determining that conditions at the *410Nolasco and Arguello prisons are unconstitutional.\nTherefore, when evaluating the benefits of the settlement in these cases, it is necessary to consider the very real\npossibility that plaintiffs might not be successful at trial. Not only must class counsel thoroughly investigate facts,\nthey must be alert to new interpretations of the parties' legal responsibilities. For example, while this action was\npending the Supreme Court issued its decision in Wilson v. Seiter, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d\n271 (1991), considering again the essential showing a prisoner must make in claiming that the conditions of his\nconfinement violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nIn preparation for trial, the parties have engaged in substantial discovery, including consultation with a number of\nexpert witnesses, to assess the conditions at the Three Prisons and the AVCF. The plaintiffs' experts are\nknowledgeable in their respective fields of prison conditions, have toured the facilities in question, and have had\nthe opportunity to review pertinent documents regarding the physical conditions and the operation of the prisons.\nOver the past several years the State has spent millions of dollars to renovate the physical facilities at the Three\nPrisons and the AVCF, including the renovation of entire cell houses, extensive asbestos removal, and the\nreplacement of electrical, fire prevention, heating and ventilation systems. These steps already taken by the\ndefendants, together with those contemplated in the proposed settlement agreement, should ensure that\nconditions at the subject prisons meet constitutional standards. The Court finds that resolution of the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims, as set forth in the proposed \"Agreement for Settlement of Claims,\" is fair, reasonable and in the best\ninterests of the class members and is preferable to a trial.\nNEGOTIATION OF THE SETTLEMENTS\nThe settlement agreements are the product of difficult and arms-length negotiations among the attorneys for the\nparties. Class counsel are experienced in litigation challenging conditions of confinement in prisons, having\nrepresented plaintiffs in these and dozens of other cases over the past 15 years. Colorado counsel for the class\nhave been assisted in their negotiations and evaluation of conditions of confinement at the various prisons, not\nonly by the experts retained in this case, but also by experts in the field of prison rights litigation working with the\nNational Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nThe Court has also relied upon the services of a Special Master in this case, The Honorable Steven L.R.\nMcNichols. Governor McNichols is a former governor of the State of Colorado and has consulted with the State\nParole Board for several years. He has intimate familiarity with the issues raised in these cases and conditions of\nconfinement at the prisons. Governor McNichols appeared at the settlement hearing and urged the court to\napprove the proposed settlement agreement.\nOnce the proposed settlement agreement was negotiated by the attorneys, the terms of the proposed\nagreements were conveyed to representative members of the plaintiff class, including prisoners at each of the\nprisons involved in the cases. Class counsel met in person with representative members of the class and\ndiscussed the terms of the settlement agreement at length. Subsequent to those meetings, certain changes were\nmade in the proposed agreements to reflect concerns raised by the prisoners.\nBased upon this evidence of the negotiation process, the Court finds that the settlement agreements were\nnegotiated in good faith. Class counsel were skilled and experienced, and representative members of the class\nhad an opportunity to comment on the proposed settlement agreements before they were finalized.\nRESPONSE TO INMATE OBJECTIONS\nRelatively few complaints and comments have been received in response to the notice, considering the size of\nthe class and the fact that seven medium and high security facilities are involved. Considering the breadth of the\n411 issues involved, the comparatively *411 low number of inmate objections is itself some indication that the\nagreements are reasonable for the class as a whole. The Court has carefully reviewed all of those objections and\naddresses them collectively as follows.\nA. Overcrowding and Double Bunking\nThe most common objection was that the facilities were overcrowded and that double bunking should be\nspecifically prohibited. The inmates of the Nolasco class sought the elimination of double bunking and the Diaz\ninmates, especially those at Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility, objected to the removal of the population\ncap, which has effectively prohibited double bunking at that facility. The Court recognizes that prison\novercrowding may be responsible for deficiencies in other core constitutional areas such as medical, dental and\nmental health care; food; clothing; shelter and sanitation standards; personal and fire safety; and access to the\ncourts. It was in these areas that the defendants were alleged to have violated the class members' rights and it\nwas these issues which class counsel have thoroughly investigated.\nSince Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), double bunking in and of itself\ndoes not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Thus, although the inmates may find double bunking undesirable and even unpleasant, the Court\nagrees with the conclusions expressed by class counsel, based on the reports of their experts and their own\ninvestigations, that the double bunking permitted under the proposed settlement agreements will not offend the\nConstitution under the circumstances of this case. Furthermore, the Court finds that the notable increase in the\n\nnumber of staff positions at each of the Diaz facilities should promote a corresponding increase in the availability\nof programs, thereby diminishing the tensions associated with inactivity.\nB. Medical and Dental Treatment\nA second theme of the inmates' comments and objections concerned medical and dental services. In some\nrespects these comments raised issues personal to individual inmates or stated a concern that these services\nmay deteriorate in the future.\nConcerning the Diaz class, the Court is persuaded that the defendants have addressed the problems with\nmedical and dental treatment that led to the court's intervention in the first place. Ramos v. Lamm, 485 F.Supp. at\n142-44. This progress, together with the changes contemplated in the settlement agreement, demonstrate a\ncommitment by the defendants to provide medical and dental care at the prisons that is consistent with minimum\nconstitutional standards.\nThe 1985 Consent Order incorporated a health care plan that provided for a certain level of services at each of\nthe Diaz facilities and, significantly, for the separation of security and clinical responsibilities within the\nDepartment. The defendants have committed to working for a continuation of this centralization of health services\nin the clinical services division of the DOC. Furthermore, the defendants have agreed to hire, and have already\nhired, a full-time medical director and an additional full-time psychiatrist for the Department. These changes\nshould help to ensure adequate medical and dental care, and should inure to the benefit of all of the class\nmembers.\nC. Mental Health Care\nIn resolution of these actions, the defendants have agreed to establish CMI Units at CCF and AVCF. The\ndefendants have agreed to add the additional staff necessary to provide a therapeutic environment for CMI\ninmates. The principal inmate complaint with respect to these CMI Units is that they will be improperly operated in\nthe absence of court supervision. The Court finds that the agreement to resolve the inmates' claims regarding this\nissue by the provision of the CMI units provided for in the agreements and their attachments is a fair and\nreasonable resolution of existing claims. Fears regarding possible violations sometime in the future are not cause\nto reject these settlements. In any event, class counsel have assured the Court that they will not hesitate to\n412 intervene if the *412 programs are not operated in accordance with the program descriptions (see attachment \"B\"\nto the Diaz Settlement Agreement; attachment \"G\" to the Nolasco Settlement Agreement).\nD. Sex Offender Treatment Programs\nThe Agreement for Settlement of Claims obligates the defendants to provide or continue to provide all eligible sex\noffenders access to sex offender treatment at the levels set forth in Attachment E. The inmates' principal\ncomplaint concerns the possibility for self-incrimination through the required disclosures made in connection with\nsex offender treatment. However, the settlement agreement does not create a waiver of any existing privilege.\nParagraph 11 of the settlement agreement makes clear that \"any and all admissions or statements made by\ninmates concerning wrongful sexual behavior while participating in or applying for admission into any sex\noffender program will be considered to be a part of a confidential medical record and a privileged communication\nas provided by statute.\" (emphasis added).\nE. Non-Binding Peer Review\nThe provision in the proposed settlement agreements permitting non-binding peer review plainly constitutes a\nnegotiated compromise. Although the defendants may not have been willing to submit to binding peer review, the\nCourt agrees with class counsel's assessment that even a purely advisory peer review will have a salutary effect\non the operation of these prisons.\n\nF. Food Service\nThe Court takes seriously all complaints concerning the preparation and delivery food. It is clear that safe and\nwholesome food is critically important to the health, dignity and well-being of inmates as well as staff. The\ndefendants have agreed to take concrete steps to improve food service in the subject facilities, such as the\nreplacement of food carts and the renovation of the old kitchen at BVCF. The Court also notes that regular and\non-going inspections by the Colorado Department of Health will ensure that food service facilities meet minimum\nconstitutional standards at all times.\nG. Legislative Funding\nThe Court recognizes that the proposed settlement agreements are contingent on appropriate legislative funding.\nThis fact of constitutional government is not a reason for withholding approval of the proposed settlements. The\nagreements specifically provide that if legislative funding is not forthcoming, either party may withdraw its consent\nto the agreement and resume a litigation posture.\nH. Two-Year Period of Compliance\nThe two-year period of compliance in the proposed settlement agreements plainly is the product of a negotiated\ncompromise. The defendants no doubt were willing to make concessions in some areas in return for a shorter\ncompliance period.\nI. Fears of Future Violations by the Defendants\nUnderlying all of the objections from members of both classes is the fear that the defendants may, sometime in\nthe future, confine the class members in conditions that violate their constitutional rights. Given the experience of\nthe Diaz class, such apprehension is understandable. However, the Court is impressed less by the events of the\n1970's than by those of the 1980's. If the 1970's ended with a ruling that the rights of the inmates at \"Old Max\"\nhad been violated, the 1980's are a record of the state's efforts to comply with this Court's remedial orders. As\nrecounted above, class counsel have been most vigilant in ensuring that the remedial orders have been obeyed.\nThe last decade has also been marked by a rapid growth in prison population and a similar growth in state\nexpenditures for both prison construction and prison operation. These expenditures have been devoted not only\nto new facilities but also existing ones, including those at issue here, and these agreements contemplate yet\nmore. Financial expenditures alone do not absolve the defendants from liability, but the willingness to devote\nthese resources is seen as a concrete indication that the defendants are prepared to accept their responsibility to\nthe plaintiffs.\n413 *413 The Court also notes that the Legislature has a new approach to the sentencing of convicted felons, one\nthat recognizes that there must be a commitment of financial resources concomitant with an increase in criminal\nsentences. In the 1991 legislative session, the General Assembly passed ยง 2-2-703, C.R.S. requiring that body to\naddress the fiscal impact of felony sentences before bills increasing sentences are passed by the respective\nHouses. As represented by defense counsel, the General Assembly has applied that law on a number of\noccasions during this most recent legislative session. The Court further notes that the General Assembly has\nalready passed and the Governor signed the state funding bill for the upcoming fiscal year, which includes\nfunding for the first year's commitments under these agreements.\nIt is clear that great strides have been taken in the past 10 years to improve conditions at the State's prisons.\nUnder the circumstances, the Court does not think that further court supervision is warranted, particularly in light\nof the evolving legal standards for institutional reform litigation. Compare Board of Education of Oklahoma City\nPublic Schools v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991)with Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d\n\n1523 (10th Cir.1983),cert. denied,465 U.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79 L.Ed.2d 248 (1984). See also Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992).\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court finds and concludes that the \"Final Agreement and Stipulation\" in Diaz and the \"Agreement for\nSettlement of Claims\" in Nolasco and Arguello are fair, adequate and reasonable and in the best interests of the\nclass as a whole. The Court further finds and concludes that the class members received adequate notice of the\nproposed settlements pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the\nagreements are APPROVED in their entirety and without modification in conformance with Rule 23(e) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nIt is therefore ORDERED: the Final Agreement and Stipulation in Diaz and the Agreement for Settlement of\nClaims in Nolasco and Arguello are approved pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nSubject to the provisions of the \"Settlement of Claims\" entered in Nolasco and Arguello, and upon the stipulation\nof the parties, the Complaint and Amended Complaints in Nolasco and Arguello are hereby dismissed with\nprejudice. Subject to the provisions of the Final Agreement and Stipulation entered in Diaz, and upon the\nstipulation of the parties, all previous orders of the Court in Diaz are hereby dissolved and are no longer effective.\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Show Cause why defendants should not be held in contempt is withdrawn. The parties are\nordered to carry out the respective terms of the Final Agreement and Stipulation in Diaz and the Agreement for\nSettlement of Claims in Nolasco and Arguello.\nThis Order terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits and leaves nothing to be done but to ensure\nperformance by the parties as they have agreed, apart from such collateral orders as may be necessary to rule\non an attorneys' fees petition. This Court retains jurisdiction for the limited purpose of issuing such collateral\norders, but such reservation shall not affect the finality of this Order which is hereby entered on the merits under\nRule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nThis Court hereby expressly finds that there is no just reason for delay and accordingly DIRECTS the Clerk of the\nCourt to enter Final Judgment and dismissal with prejudice in Diaz, No. 77-C-1093, Nolasco, No. 90-C-340, and \nArguello, No. 88-C-1335.\nPlaintiffs shall have until July 15, 1992 to submit their petition for an award of attorneys' fees and costs relating to\nthis matter.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
