The plaintiffs were incarcerated sex offenders and sex offenders on probation. The plaintiffs, who were represented by private counsel, sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. They alleged that a probation policy, which provided a sex offender notification policy, and a Connecticut statute, which required that convicted sex offenders submit a blood sample for analysis and inclusion in a DNA data bank, violated their right to privacy and the constitutional guarantees of due process, equal protection, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. The challenge to the sex offender notification policy and the challenge to the requirement of the blood sample for the DNA data bank began independently and were consolidated in September 1996. </p><p>One of the plaintiffs, a sex offender on probation, sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from disseminating information about the sexual offenses to which he plead guilty to his employer, neighbors, and the general community. On August 27, 1996, the District Court (Judge Dominic J. Squatrito) granted the plaintiff a preliminary injunction. Roe v. Office of Adult Probation, 938 F. Supp. 1080 (D. Conn. 1996). The defendants appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Judge Jon O. Newman) vacated the District Court's grant of the preliminary injunction and remanded the case. Roe v. Office of Probation, 125 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 1997).</p><p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in part. The court dismissed all of the plaintiffs' federal claims and declared the statute constitutional. The state law claims were dismissed without prejudice, leaving the plaintiffs free to re-file in state court. </p><p>The plaintiffs appealed only the equal protection and unreasonable search and seizure issues. On September 16, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Judge Rosemary S. Pooler) declared the Connecticut statute constitutional, reasoning that the governmental interest outweighed the intrusion of giving a blood sample. Roe v. Marcotte, 193 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 1999). The court further held that the statute did not violate the guarantee of equal protection, reasoning that there was no evidence presented that demonstrated a compelling need to test other violent felons.</p><p>The case is closed.</p><p></p>",

Gen.Stat. ยง 54-102g, which, among other things, requires all convicted sexual offenders\nwho were incarcerated on the statute's effective date to submit a blood sample for analysis and inclusion in a\nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) data bank. Plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for\nthe District of Connecticut (Squatrito, J.) dismissing their challenges to the statute's constitutionality. They argue\nthat the statute violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures and the\nFourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. We conclude that the statute is constitutional and affirm\nthe judgment of the district court.\nBACKGROUND\nThe underlying facts of this case are undisputed. Plaintiffs Thomas W. Cobb and Raymond J. Cerilli are inmates\nin the custody of the Connecticut Department of Correction. On January 9, 1990, a court sentenced Cobb to a\n75 25-year term of imprisonment upon his conviction of two *75 counts of second degree sexual assault in violation\nof Conn. Gen.Stat. (\"C.G.S.\") ยง 53a-71(a)(1) and three counts of risk of injury to a minor in violation of C.G.S. ยง\n53-21 in connection with the repeated sexual assault of his minor step-daughter. Cerilli currently is serving a 53-\nyear sentence following his conviction of, among other things, first degree sexual assault in violation of C.G.S. ยง\n\n53a-70(a). Defendants are current or former officers or employees of the State of Connecticut Department of\nCorrection and Office of Adult Probation.\nIn 1994, the Connecticut legislature adopted Public Act 94-246, which was codified as C.G.S. ยง 54-102g (\"the\nstatute\"). The effective date of the statute is October 1, 1994. It provides, in part:\n(a) Any person who (1) is convicted of a violation of section 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-70b, 53a-71,\n53a-72a or 53a-72b on or after October 1, 1994, and is sentenced to the custody of the\nCommissioner of Correction or (2) has been convicted of a violation of [the previously referenced\nsections] and on October 1, 1994, is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction shall, prior\nto release from such custody, have a sample of his blood taken for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)\nanalysis to determine identification characteristics specific to the person.\n(b) Any person convicted of a violation of [the previously referenced sections] on or after October\n1, 1994, who is not sentenced to a term of confinement shall, as a condition of such sentence,\nhave a sample of his blood taken for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis to determine\nidentification characteristics specific to the person.\nTrained medical personnel must take the blood sample, and the Connecticut state police forensic science\nlaboratory must perform the analysis. See id. ยงยง 54-102h, 54-102i. The results of the testing must remain stored\nin a confidential data bank. See id. ยง 54-102i. However, \"[t]he [anonymous] results of an analysis and comparison\nof the identification characteristics from two or more blood or other biological samples shall be made available\ndirectly to federal, state and local law enforcement officers upon request made in furtherance of an official\ninvestigation of any criminal offense.\" Id. ยง 54-102j(a). \"Only when a sample or DNA profile supplied by the\nperson making the request satisfactorily matches a profile in the data bank shall the existence of data in the data\nbank be confirmed or identifying information from the data bank be disseminated.\" Id. ยง 54-102j(b).\nPlaintiffs are subject to the provisions of the statute because of their convictions of sex offenses specified under\nthe statute and their continued incarceration on or after October 1, 1994. To date, both have refused defendants'\nrequest that they submit a blood sample for analysis and inclusion in the data bank. In light of plaintiffs' refusal,\nthe Attorney General of the State of Connecticut has the authority pursuant to State of Connecticut Department of\nCorrection Administrative Directive No. 9.3 to seek a court order compelling them to provide a DNA sample.\nIn April 1995 and December 1995 respectively, Cerilli and Cobb filed complaints challenging the validity of the\nstatute and seeking to prevent defendants from forcibly taking their blood. The court appointed Attorney Peter L.\nCostas pro bono counsel for Cerilli in October 1995 and for Cobb in January 1996. Upon plaintiffs' motions, the\n[1]\ndistrict court consolidated the two cases on September 9, 1996.  Thereafter, plaintiffs filed amended complaints\n76 alleging that the statute violated their federal constitutional rights in that it (1) constituted an ex post facto law; *76\n(2) violated their rights to due process and equal protection; (3) authorized an unreasonable search and seizure\nin violation of the Fourth Amendment; (4) inflicted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eight\nAmendment; and (5) violated their right to privacy. Plaintiffs also alleged a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for\ndeprivation of constitutional rights and sought redress for violations of various rights guaranteed by the\nConnecticut constitution. Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as an injunction\npreventing defendants' involuntary taking of their blood and a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional.\nDefendants counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment upholding the statute's constitutionality and an injunction\ncompelling plaintiffs to submit to the taking of a blood sample and allowing defendants to use reasonable force if\nnecessary.\nOn cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted defendants' motion in part, dismissing all of\nplaintiffs' federal claims and declaring the statute constitutional, and denied plaintiffs' motion. The court dismissed\nplaintiffs' state law claims without prejudice to refiling in state court. The court later reopened and vacated its\n[2]\nentry of summary judgment as to plaintiffs' Section 1983 claims.  The district court then entered a partial\n[3]\njudgment and certified the constitutionality issue for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b).\nPlaintiffs filed notices of appeal on August 29, 1998.\n\nIn July 1998, Attorney Costas moved for leave to withdraw as counsel to Cerilli, citing disagreements as to\nstrategy and Cerilli's dissatisfaction with Costas' representation. The court granted Costas' motion to withdraw.\nCerilli filed several motions in this Court for assignment of counsel, all of which we denied because Cerilli\nrequested counsel to address issues not properly before the Court on appeal. In a May 28, 1999, order denying\nCerilli's motion for assignment of counsel, we advised the parties that the appeal would proceed and argument\nwould be scheduled despite Cerilli's failure to file a pro se brief by May 13, 1999, in compliance with a scheduling\norder. Costas perfected Cobb's appeal and appeared at oral argument. We now turn to Cobb's contentions.\nDISCUSSION\nCobb does not seek to declare the entire DNA statute unconstitutional, but rather seeks to invalidate \"only that\nportion which encompasses sexual offenders who were imprisoned on its effective date ... whether or not their\ncurrent imprisonment was predicated upon a sexual offense.\" Although he asserted numerous constitutional\nchallenges below, Cobb raises only two on appeal: that the statute violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures and that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The Court reviews de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. See Cronin v. Aetna Life\nIns. Co., 46 F.3d 196, 203 (2d Cir.1995).\nI. Fourth Amendment\nCobb argues that the statute violates the Fourth Amendment because it compels him to produce evidence that\nmay be used in future criminal investigations merely because of his status as a convicted sex offender and\n77 without requiring a showing of probable cause or reasonable suspicion that he has committed a particular crime. \n*77 Defendants respond that the statute withstands Fourth Amendment scrutiny because the intrusion it\noccasions is minimal and justified by a significant governmental interest.\nDefendants do not dispute the well-established principle that \"a `compelled intrusio[n] into the body for blood to\nbe analyzed' ... must be deemed a Fourth Amendment search.\" Skinner v. Railway Labor Execs. Ass'n, 489 U.S.\n602, 616, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989) (quoting Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 767-68, 86\nS.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966)). Thus, we need only decide whether the statutorily required blood test at\nissue comports with the Fourth Amendment's mandate that a search be reasonable. See id. at 619, 109 S.Ct.\n1402 (\"Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all searches and seizures, but only those that are unreasonable\").\nWhat is reasonable \"depends on all of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the\nsearch or seizure itself,\" and the permissibility of the search is \"judged by balancing its intrusion on the\nindividual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\" Id. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). The Supreme Court has stated:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nIn most criminal cases, courts strike the reasonableness balance in favor of the Warrant Clause of the Fourth\nAmendment; except in well-defined circumstances, a search is not reasonable unless it is carried out pursuant to\na judicial warrant issued on probable cause. See Skinner, 489 U.S. at 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402. In general, searches\nperformed in the absence of a warrant and pursuant to an exception must nevertheless be predicated upon\n\"probable cause to believe that the person to be searched has violated the law,\" or, at the very least, \"some\nquantum of individualized suspicion.\" Id. at 624, 109 S.Ct. 1402.\n\nHowever, the concept of probable cause is \"peculiarly related to criminal investigations\" in which a specific\nindividual is the target of government suspicion; in these cases searches are carried out \"solely for the purpose of\ninvestigating criminal conduct, ... [and] the validity of the searches [is] therefore dependent on application of the\nprobable-cause and warrant requirements.\" Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U.S. 367, 371, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d\n739 (1987) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In certain circumstances, generally outside the\ntraditional law enforcement setting, a search may be reasonable even when predicated upon less than probable\ncause or individualized suspicion where \"special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement\" render\nthose requirements impracticable. Skinner, 489 U.S. at 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted) As the Supreme Court stated in Skinner:\nWhen the balance of interests precludes insistence on a showing of probable cause, we have\nusually required some quantum of individualized suspicion before concluding that a search is\nreasonable. We made it clear, however, that a showing of individualized suspicion is not a\nconstitutional floor, below which a search must be presumed unreasonable. In limited\ncircumstances, where the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal, and where an\n78 important governmental interest furthered by the *78 intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a\nrequirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such\nsuspicion.\n489 U.S. at 624, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also New\nJersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 340, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985) (\"probable cause is not an irreducible\nrequirement of a valid search;\" \"fundamental command\" of Fourth Amendment is that searches be reasonable)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Supreme Court has applied the so-called \"special needs\" exception outside the criminal investigatory\ncontext. In these cases, a significant governmental interest, such as the maintenance of institutional security,\npublic safety, and order, must prevail over a minimal intrusion on an individual's privacy rights to justify a search\non less than individualized suspicion. For example, the Court has employed this exception to uphold the\nconstitutionality of searches and seizures designed to maintain order and security in hospitals, see O'Connor v.\nOrtega, 480 U.S. 709, 725, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987) (search of employees' desks and offices\n\"should be judged by the standard of reasonableness\" articulated in the \"special needs\" exception); in schools, \nsee T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 346-47, 105 S.Ct. 733 (search of student property without probable cause was\nreasonable); in highly regulated industries, see Skinner, 489 U.S. at 633, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (blood and urine tests to\ndetermine alcohol use following rail accidents justified by safety concerns); and in government agencies, see \nNational Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 666-67, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989)\n(United States Customs Service's mandatory testing of employees who applied for promotion or transfer to\npositions directly involving the interdiction of illegal drugs or to positions that required employee to carry a firearm\nwas reasonable despite absence of probable cause or some level of reasonable suspicion). The \"special needs\"\ncases reaffirm \"the longstanding principle that neither a warrant nor probable cause, nor, indeed, any measure of\nindividualized suspicion, is an indispensable component of reasonableness in every circumstance.\" Von Raab,\n489 U.S. at 665, 109 S.Ct. 1384 (citing Skinner, 489 U.S. at 618-24, 109 S.Ct. 1402).\nThe \"special needs\" exception also applies to the prison setting. While convicted prisoners do not forfeit all\nconstitutional protections by reason of their conviction and confinement, the rights they retain are subject to\nrestrictions dictated by concerns for institutional security, order, and discipline. In Bell, 441 U.S. at 558-60, 99\nS.Ct. 1861, for example, the Court upheld the constitutionality of body cavity inspections of inmates following\n\"contact visits,\" even in the absence of probable cause, in light of the unique security dangers inherent in a\ndetention facility, including the \"all too common\" occurrence of the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and other\ncontraband. Similarly, the Tenth Circuit has held that a prison may require inmates to undergo blood testing for\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in order to ascertain the extent to which inmates are infected with\nthe disease and to control and prevent the spread of AIDS in prison. See Dunn v. White, 880 F.2d 1188, 1195-97\n(10th Cir. 1989) (recognizing that although the Fourth Amendment preserves a prisoner's \"privacy expectation in\nhis body,\" the government's interest in protecting inmate health and safety justified the minimal bodily intrusion\noccasioned by the blood test).\n\nAs plaintiffs correctly note, the requirement in the statute before us that prisoners provide a DNA sample for a\nstate and national data bank is not motivated by concerns for inmate safety and health, institutional order, or\n79 discipline. For this reason, none of the \"special *79 needs\" cases involving prisons that defendants cite is\nprecisely on point. Nevertheless, the statute may still be constitutional if defendants can show some other\nsignificant governmental interest in the form of \"special needs beyond normal law enforcement,\" even if those\n\"special needs\" are not tied directly to institutional concerns. In this regard, Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868,\n107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987), provides a helpful analogy.\nIn Griffin, the Supreme Court reviewed a Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services (\"DHSS\")\nregulation that permitted a warrantless search of a probationer's home if there existed \"reasonable grounds\" to\nbelieve that the probationer possessed contraband, including items he was prohibited from possessing under the\nconditions of his probation. See Id. at 870-71, 107 S.Ct. 3164. The Court observed that \"[a] State's operation of a\nprobation system, like its operation of a school, government office or prison, or its supervision of a regulated\nindustry, likewise presents `special needs' beyond normal law enforcement that may justify departures from the\nusual warrant and probable-cause requirements\" and that \"in certain circumstances government investigators\nconducting searches pursuant to a regulatory scheme need not adhere to the usual warrant or probable-cause\nrequirements as long as their searches meet `reasonable legislative or administrative standards.'\" Id. at 873-74,\n107 S.Ct. 3164 (quoting Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 538, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967)).\nThe Court upheld the search of Griffin's home, without regard to whether the information on which the probation\nofficer initiated the search satisfied a federal \"reasonable grounds\" standard, because the regulation authorizing\nthe search was itself sufficient to satisfy the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement. See id. at 872-73,\n107 S.Ct. 3164. Griffin, as a probationer committed to the legal custody of the DHSS, was subject to a range of\nrestrictions \"meant to assure that the probation serve[d] as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the\ncommunity [was] not harmed by [his] being at large.\" Id. at 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164. Relying on research that\nindicated that more intensive supervision of probationers reduced recidivism, the Court concluded that\nsupervision was a \"`special need' of the State permitting a degree of impingement upon privacy that would not be\nconstitutional if applied to the public at large.\" Id. at 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164.\nWe conclude that a reasoned interpretation of the \"special needs\" doctrine supports the constitutionality of the\nDNA statute. In defense of the statute, defendants cite studies indicating a high rate of recidivism among sexual\noffenders. Moreover, DNA evidence is particularly useful in investigating sexual offenses and identifying the\nperpetrators because of the nature of the evidence left at the scenes of these crimes and the demonstrated\nreliability of DNA testing. Defendants argue that the existence of state and national DNA data banks will serve an\nimportant governmental interest in solving both past and future crimes. More importantly, they contend that the\nstatute's requirement that imprisoned sexual offenders provide a DNA sample will deter these individuals from\ncommitting future offenses of a similar nature. Balanced against this significant interest is the drawing of a blood\nsample for testing, an intrusion that the Supreme Court has characterized as minimal. See Skinner, 489 U.S. at\n625, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (citing Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 762, 105 S.Ct. 1611, 84 L.Ed.2d 662 (1985)) (noting\nthat Court's decision in Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), \"confirmed\nsociety's judgment that blood tests do not constitute an unduly extensive imposition on an individual's privacy and\nbodily integrity\"). Although the samples may later be used for law enforcement purposes, traditional concerns of\n80 probable cause and reasonable suspicion are minimized by the statute's blanket approach to testing. See Von\n*80Raab, 489 U.S. at 667, 109 S.Ct. 1384 (Customs Service's testing of all employees who applied for particular\npositions was reasonable because no official discretion was involved. \"Because the Service does not make a\ndiscretionary determination to search based on a judgment that certain conditions are present, there are simply\n`no special facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate.'\") (quoting South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364, 383,\n96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring)). Upon consideration of the minimal intrusion\ninvolved, the important state interest, and the lack of discretionary decisions, we conclude that the balance of\ninterests in this case tips in defendants' favor and conclude that the DNA statute survives Fourth Amendment\nscrutiny. See Michigan Dep't of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 455, 110 S.Ct. 2481, 110 L.Ed.2d 412 (1990)\n(employing balancing test to uphold highway sobriety checkpoints). To the extent that \"[t]he ensuing chemical\nanalysis of the [DNA] sample to obtain physiological data is a further invasion of the tested [individual's] privacy\ninterests,\" see Skinner, 489 U.S. at 616, 109 S.Ct. 1402, we conclude that the statute provides adequate\nsafeguards to ensure that the intrusion is minimal. For example, the statute regulates the manner in which\n\ndefendants conduct the blood test and analyze the results, see Conn. Gen. Stat. ยงยง 54-102h, 54-102i; restricts\naccess to and secures the confidentiality of the results, see id. ยง 54-102j; and provides for the expungement of\nthe results from the data bank upon the reversal or dismissal of a conviction, see id. ยง 54-102l.\nOur holding comports with the conclusions reached by the three circuit courts of appeals that have thus far\nexamined the constitutionality of nearly identical DNA statutes. See Boling v. Romer, 101 F.3d 1336 (10th\nCir.1996); Rise v. State of Oregon, 59 F.3d 1556 (9th Cir.1995); Jones v. Murray, 962 F.2d 302 (4th Cir.1992). The\ndistrict court principally relied on the Fourth Circuit's decision in Jones to support its rejection of plaintiffs' Fourth\nAmendment challenge. We turn now to a brief discussion of Jones because although we affirm the district court's\nfinding as to the statute's constitutionality, we do so for reasons different from those articulated by the Fourth\nCircuit and cited by the district court.\nIn Jones, the Court reviewed a Virginia statute that, insofar as is relevant here, required all convicted sex\noffenders who were incarcerated on the statute's effective date to provide a blood sample for DNA analysis and\nstorage. See Jones, 962 F.2d at 304 (citing Va.Code Ann. ยง 19.2-310.2). Examining the statute's validity under\nthe Fourth Amendment, the court held:\nWe have not been made aware of any case . . . establishing a per se Fourth Amendment\nrequirement of probable cause, or even a lesser degree of individualized suspicion, when\ngovernment officials conduct a limited search for the purpose of ascertaining and recording the\nidentity of a person who is lawfully confined to prison. This is not surprising when we consider that\nprobable cause had already supplied the basis for bringing the person within the criminal justice\nsystem. With the person's loss of liberty upon arrest comes the loss of at least some, if not all,\nrights to personal privacy otherwise protected by the Fourth Amendment.\nId. at 306. The court noted that it found support for its holding in \"the fact that the Supreme Court has not\ncategorically required individualized suspicion in the case of every search which advances a law enforcement\nobjective,\" alluding presumably to the \"special needs\" exception. Id. at 307 n. 2. However, the court also stated\nexplicitly that its holding did not rest on the \"special needs\" doctrine because it considered \"cases which involve\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of prison inmates to comprise a separate category of cases to which the usual per\n81 se requirement of probable cause does not apply.\" Id. The court went on to conclude that the *81 governmental\ninterest at stake 00 \"preserving a permanent identification record of convicted felons for resolving past and future\n97\ncrimes\" 00 outweighed the \"slight intrusion\" in giving a blood sample. Id. at 307.\n97\nJudge Murnaghan agreed that the Virginia statute was constitutional insofar as it required DNA samples from\nviolent felons but dissented from the majority's view that the statute constitutionally could take DNA from non-\nviolent offenders. In an opinion concurring as to the testing of violent felons, he criticized the majority for its\n\"strikingly truncated view of the Fourth Amendment protections afforded to a convicted felon.\" Id. at 311\n(Murnaghan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Judge Murnaghan went on to state:\nPrisoners most assuredly do give up specific aspects of their reasonable expectation of privacy\nbecause of practical concerns relating to living conditions, and because of the necessities involved\nin ensuring prison security. However, in the present case, appellants have not forfeited their\nexpectation of privacy with respect to blood testing, and no practical penal concern justifies the\ndeparture involved in the DNA procedure. Accordingly, the Commonwealth's DNA testing\nprocedure should be reviewed under the standard applied to a search of any individual when such\na search is not based on individualized suspicion: the privacy interest of the prisoner in remaining\nfree of bodily invasion should be balanced against the state interest in carrying out the search.\nId. at 312. Judge Murnaghan concluded that prisoners have no expectation of privacy in their cells and \"lose the\naspect of their right to privacy that protects them from routine searches.\" Id. at 312-13. He pointed out, however,\nthat this diminished privacy expectation directly results from \"practical considerations requiring additional\nauthority on the part of prison officials to control potentially dangerous prison communities.\" Id. at 313. Because\nthe state's DNA testing requirement was not justified by internal prison security needs, Judge Murnaghan\nbelieved that prisoners had a \"reasonable expectation of privacy within [their] bod[ies].\" Id. at 312. Although\n\nconcurring in the ultimate conclusion that the statute was constitutional as to violent felons, Judge Murnaghan\nadvocated a different test for evaluating prisoners' Fourth Amendment rights:\nJustification for searches of these individuals must be based, as must all searches of citizens in a\nfree society still clinging to disappearing Fourth Amendment protections, on a balancing of the\nprivacy interest involved against the state interest in the search to determine which interest is\nmore compelling. See Michigan Dep't of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 110 S.Ct. 2481, 110\nL.Ed.2d 412 (1990). It is with a reasoned application of the Sitz standard, and not with a disturbing\nrestriction of the Fourth Amendment protections afforded to the nation's prisoners, that the DNA\ntesting procedure, as applied to felons convicted of violent crime, may be justified.\nId. at 313. Because the record indicated that violent offenders posed a significant risk of recidivism, Judge\nMurnaghan agreed with the majority that DNA testing of violent offenders was constitutional. However, he would\nhave held that the \"extremely tenuous link connecting persons convicted of non-violent felonies to the\ncommission of future violent crime\" rendered the statute unconstitutional as applied to non-violent offenders. Id.\nat 314.\nJudge Marathon's analysis provides a more compelling rationale for upholding the DNA statute's constitutionality\nthan does the Jones majority opinion. Clearly, the cases in which the Supreme Court has concluded that\nprisoners forfeit their Fourth Amendment rights upon incarceration deal with searches of their cells or their\n82 persons for reasons of safety and *82 orderly administration of prison facilities, concerns not implicated here.\nThus, for the reasons stated above, we join the circuits that have upheld the constitutionality of similar statutes\nbut depart from the rationale adopted by those circuits and, as set forth above, premise our holding upon the\n\"special needs\" exception. See State v. Olivas, 122 Wash.2d 73, 856 P.2d 1076, 1086 (1993) (en banc)\n(upholding constitutionality of DNA testing of violent offenders and sexual offenders and concluding that\napplication of \"special needs\" balancing test was \"a better reasoned approach\" than the Fourth Circuit's analysis\nin Jones, which \"diminished the privacy rights of convicted persons.\"). Because studies cited by defendants\nindicate a high rate of recidivism among sexual offenders, and because DNA evidence is particularly useful in\nsolving such crimes, the statute passes the \"special needs\" balancing test.\nII. Equal Protection\nCobb argues that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause because it (1) impermissibly distinguishes\nbetween individuals convicted of crimes characterized as sexual offenses and those convicted of other violent\noffenses, (2) targets incarcerated sex offenders but not prior sex offenders who currently reside in the community,\nand (3) targets convicted sex offenders whether or not their current incarceration is for a sex offense. Because\nCobb alleges a classification based on the nature of his offense, his challenge to the DNA statute is entitled to\nonly \"rational basis\" and not \"strict scrutiny\" review. See Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 465, 111 S.Ct.\n1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (applying rational basis test to classification based on nature of offense); see also \nArtway v. Attorney General, 81 F.3d 1235, 1267 (3d Cir.1996) (sex offenders are not a suspect class for purposes\nof Fourteenth Amendment analysis). Under the rational basis test, the \"statute is presumed to be valid and will be\nsustained if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\" Bankers Life & Cas. Co. v.\nCrenshaw, 486 U.S. 71, 81, 108 S.Ct. 1645, 100 L.Ed.2d 62 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\ndistrict court correctly found that the statute survives a rational basis analysis. Plaintiffs presented no evidence\nthat there was a compelling need to test other violent felons. In any event, the statute's claimed\n\"underinclusiveness\" does not provide a basis for invalidating it. See Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.,\n348 U.S. 483, 487-89, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955) (under rational basis review, legislature may proceed\n\"one step at a time\"). We therefore conclude that the statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n[1] The court also granted plaintiffs' request that the action be consolidated with one brought by Robert Roe, who\nchallenged only the community notification portion of the statute. Our decision in that case is reported as Roe v.\nOffice of Adult Probation, 125 F.3d 47 (2d Cir.1997). Roe is not a party to this appeal.\n[2] Concluding that the Section 1983 claims would require a hearing, the parties agreed to reserve this claim.\n[3] The court thereafter withdrew its Section 1292(b) certification and ordered entry of final judgment on plaintiffs'\nfirst eleven causes of action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Pursuant to Rule 54(b), the court certified that there was\n\"no just reason for delay\" in entering a final judgment dismissing the claims challenging the constitutionality of the\nstatute, thereby permitting an immediate appeal of that dismissal.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "938 F.Supp. 1080 (1996)\nRobert ROE, Plaintiff,\nv.\nThe OFFICE OF ADULT PROBATION, et al., Defendants.\nNo. 3:96cv001 (DJS).\nUnited States District Court, D. Connecticut.\nAugust 27, 1996.\n11008812 *1081*1082 John P. Clifford, Jr., Eliot B. Gersten, Gersten & Clifford, Hartford, CT, for plaintiff.\nStephen J. O'Neill, Margaret Quilter Chapple, Attorney General's Office, Public Safety & Special Revenue,\nHartford, CT, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nSQUATRITO, District Judge.\nThis cause is before the court on plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. An evidentiary hearing was held\nbefore the court on February 22-23, 26, 29 and March 5. Based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing, the\nrecord in this case, and the reasons set forth below, the court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated that an\ninjunction is warranted.\nI. FACTS\nA. The Plaintiff\nRobert Roe was arrested in 1989 for sexual assault. In May, 1991, the plaintiff entered into a plea agreement in\nwhich he agreed to plead nolo contendere to six counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of\nConn.Gen.Stat. ยง 53a-71 and six counts of risk of injury to a minor in violation of Conn. Gen.Stat. ยง 53-21. In\nAugust, 1991, the plaintiff was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment, execution suspended after six years,\nand a five-year term of probation. A newspaper article concerning the plaintiff's crimes and his sentence was\n1083 published after the sentencing. Plaintiff remained incarcerated *1083 until August, 1994, when he was released\non parole. A violation of a condition of plaintiff's release led to a parole revocation proceeding in December, 1994,\nafter which plaintiff was returned to prison for eight months in order to complete his original sentence.\nPlaintiff was released from prison in August, 1995, and, pursuant to his sentence, was placed under the\nsupervision of the Office of Adult Probation (\"OAP\"). Defendant Ronald Cormier is plaintiff's assigned probation\nofficer.\nB. The Statute and the Guidelines\nIn 1994 the Connecticut General Assembly enacted a law regarding registration of persons convicted of sexual\nassault crimes. The law applied to individuals convicted of sexual assault, as that term is defined in the statute,\n[1]\n\"on or after January 1, 1995.\" Conn.Gen. Stat.Ann. ยง 54-102r.  The statute required these individuals to follow\ncertain registration requirements and mandated law enforcement agencies to maintain the registrations \"for one\nyear after such person's sentence termination date,\" unless the person is convicted of a subsequent sexual\nassault charge after his release. Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. ยง 54-102r(f). The registration information was to be kept\nconfidential and disclosed only to law enforcement officers. Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. ยง 54-102r(g).\n\nIn 1995 the Connecticut legislature amended ยง 54-102r to, inter alia, provide for the release of information about\na registered sexual offender to law enforcement agencies, governmental agencies conducting confidential\nbackground checks, or \"to any specific person if such disclosure is deemed necessary by the chief of the police\ndepartment or resident state trooper of the municipality to protect said person from any person subject to the\nregistration requirement[].\" Act of May 30, 1995, Public Act No. 95-142 ยง 10(g), 1995 Conn.Legis.Serv. 312, 317\n(West). The class of persons to which the law applies, i.e., persons convicted of certain sex offenses on or after\nJanuary 1, 1995, did not change.\nSignificantly for present purposes, Public Act 95-142 also mandates that the same class of offenders convicted\n\"on or after the effective date of this act\" who are serving a period of probation must \"as a condition of such ...\nprobation, immediately notify his ... probation officer ... whenever he changes his residence address.\" The\nprobation officer then \"shall notify the chief of police of the police department or resident state trooper for the\nmunicipality of the new address of the ... probationer and any other law enforcement official he deems\nappropriate.\" Id. ยง 6(b). The act goes on to declare that \"[n]othing in this section or section 54-102r of the general\nstatutes, as amended by section 10 of this act, shall be construed to prohibit a parole officer or probation officer\nacting in the performance of his duties and within the scope of his employment from disclosing any information\nconcerning the parolee or probationer to any person whenever he deems such disclosure to be appropriate.\" Id.\nยง 6(c).\nPrior to 1995, the OAP had no policy or practice of notifying members of the general public of the criminal record\nof an offender under its supervision. Pursuant to ยง 6 of Public Act No. 95-142, the OAP promulgated a Sex\nOffender Notification Policy (the \"Guidelines\") which governed the manner in which \"[i]nformation on convicted\nsex offenders will be provided to police, victims and other relevant individuals and organizations in order to\nenhance public safety and awareness.\" (Second Am.Compl., Ex. C at 1). The Guidelines represent \"minimum\nrequirements,\" and \"Probation Officers may exceed these requirements when, in their professional judgment, it is\nnecessary to prevent or reduce the risk of the sex offender reoffending. Id. The enumeration of offenses to which\nthe Guidelines apply is identical to those cases listed in sections 6 and 10 of Public Act No. 95-142 in which the\n1084 conviction occurred after January 1, 1995. The Guidelines *1084 extend also to \"[p]ersons convicted of similar\noffenses in other states\" under the supervision of Connecticut's OAP as well as \"[a]ny other person under\nsupervision of the Office of Adult Probation and determined through clinical assessment to be a high risk sex\noffender.\" Id. The Guidelines do not define the term \"high risk sex offender.\" Unlike the legislation, which is to be\napplied prospectively, the OAP decided to \"go beyond the law\" and apply its policy retroactively to all offenders\nwithin its jurisdiction, including those convicted prior to January 1, 1995. (Pl.'s Notice of Additional Exs., Ex. P.;\nPl.'s Mem.Ex. H).\nThe Guidelines establish two levels of notification which purport to link the seriousness of the risk of an offender\nreoffending with the breadth of notification. The first level establishes that if an offender is within the OAP's\ndefinition of \"applicable cases\" the probation officer will provide information regarding the offender to victims,\nvictims parents or guardians, police, the offender's immediate family members, other occupants of the offender's\nresidence, and treatment providers, including those not providing sex offender treatment. The second level\nconcerns notification of cases involving \"pedophiles, predatory rapists and other extreme cases,\" classification of\nwhich is to be determined by clinical assessment. In such cases, the probation officer must, after consultation\nwith a supervisor, provide notification to immediate neighbors, local schools, local day care providers, employers,\nofficials of schools, training programs and other organizations in which the client participates and other groups\ndetermined to be \"at risk\" due to the client's activities or proximity.\nUnder Connecticut law the court is authorized to sentence certain individuals to\na period of probation upon conviction of any crime, other than a class A felony, if it is of the opinion\nthat: (1) Present or extended institutional confinement of the defendant is not necessary for the\nprotection of the public; (2) the defendant is in need of guidance, training or assistance which, in\nhis case, can be effectively administered through probation supervision; and (3) such disposition\nis not inconsistent with the ends of justice.\n\nConn.Gen.Stat.Ann. ยง 53a-29(a) (West 1994). The court has broad discretion in setting the conditions of the\ndefendant's probation term. The General Assembly lists several conditions for the court's explicit consideration\nand vests the sentencing judge with authority to impose \"any other conditions reasonably related to [the\noffender's] rehabilitation.\" Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. ยง 53a-30 (West 1994 & Supp.1995).\nA defendant sentenced to a period of probation is placed under the supervision of the OAP. Id. ยง 53a-29(c). The\nOAP is a statutorily created department within Connecticut's judicial department, Conn.Gen.Stat. ยง 54-103a, the\ndirector of which is charged with supervision of the State's probation officers and the maintenance of \"an efficient\nprobation service in the superior court.\" Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. ยง 54-105(a) (West 1994 & Supp.1995). The duties of\nprobation officers under Connecticut law are to \"investigate all cases referred to them for investigation by the\ndirector or by the court. They shall furnish to each person released under their supervision a written statement of\nthe conditions of probation and shall instruct him regarding the same. They shall keep informed of [the\nprobationer's] conduct and condition and use all suitable methods to aid and encourage [the probationer] and to\nbring about improvement in [the probationer's] conduct and condition.\" Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. ยง 54-108.\nConnecticut law also authorizes the OAP to require a probationer to comply \"with any or all conditions which the\ncourt could have imposed under [53a-30(a)] which are not inconsistent with any condition actually imposed by the\ncourt.\" Conn.Gen.Stat. Ann. ยง 53a-30(b) (West 1994 & Supp.1995).\nC. The Challenge\nPlaintiff filed a Verified Complaint on January 2, 1996, along with an application for temporary relief pursuant to\nFed.R.Civ.P. 65. The complaint alleges that, although the plaintiff has complied with each condition of his\nprobation, Defendant Cormier, his probation officer, has informed the plaintiff that Cormier intends to notify\n1085 plaintiff's employer, *1085 neighbors and the general community of plaintiff's prior criminal record. This decision\nallegedly was made after an evaluation conducted by a William Hobson, who is a social service provider acting\nunder contract to the State of Connecticut, in which Mr. Hobson declared that the plaintiff constituted a \"high risk\"\nof danger to minors. Cormier informed the plaintiff that he intended to disclose this information pursuant to Conn.\nGen.Stat. ยง 54-102r, as amended.\nPlaintiff, invoking 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, contends that the application of this statute to him violates numerous\nconstitutional rights. According to the plaintiff, the lack of notice and opportunity to be heard on the issue of his\nrisk classification and consequent disclosure of his criminal history violates the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Due Process is also violated by the lack of any provision allowing an individual to\ncontest either the determination that disclosure is appropriate or the extent of disclosure. Plaintiff also contends\nthat the application of the law to him violates the Ex Post Facto Clause; the Equal Protection Clause; and the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. He also asserts that the defendants' actions constitute\na violation of his plea agreement with the State of Connecticut.\nAfter a conference on the afternoon of January 2, the court denied the plaintiff's application for a restraining order\nwithout prejudice based on the parties' agreement that notification would not take place until such time as the\nOAP had an opportunity to review plaintiff's risk level. Unknown to the court or the parties in attendance at the\nconference, Mr. Cormier already had begun the process of notification, disseminating the OAP notification form to\nthe parents of the victims of the plaintiff's crimes, the plaintiff's employer, and the manager of the plaintiff's\n[2]\napartment building.  The information provided included: (1) plaintiff's name and address; (2) details of the\nplaintiff's automobile; (3) plaintiff's date of birth, sex, race, height, weight, build, eye color, hair color, and skin\ncolor; (4) the offense for which the plaintiff plead guilty; (5) the sentence imposed; (6) plaintiff's probation period;\nand (7) the conditions of plaintiff's probation. (See Pl.'s Mem., filing 77, Ex. L).\nOn January 3, 1996, the plaintiff filed a second motion for a temporary restraining order, which the court granted\nafter a conference with the parties. The court scheduled a hearing on plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction\nfor January 18, 1996. On consent of the parties, the hearing date subsequently was extended to February 22,\n[3]\n1996.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\nIncreasingly, states are responding to the problem of recidivism in sexual offender cases by singling out those\nmembers of a community who have in the past committed such a crime in the hopes that such a practice will\nprevent that offender from reoffending. Although born in the context of registration laws, which afford law\nenforcement agencies a tool to track past sex offenders, the notion has been extended to include notification\nlaws, which enable the government to inform the citizenry when a past sex offender is in the midst of a\ncommunity.\nThe plaintiff in this case does not challenge the validity of the legislative judgment regarding the problem of\nrecidivism, and for purposes of the pending proceeding that judgment is accepted. Acquiescence to the\ncorrelation between sex offender cases and relatively high recidivism rates, however, does not end the inquiry.\nCases such as this one pit the interests of society to protect itself from future harm against an individual's\n1086 opportunity to flourish in the absence of *1086 government intrusion. The context in which the case arises 00 the\n97\nState's supervision of a probationer 00 distinguishes it factually from other cases which have grappled with the\n97\nconstitutionality of community notification laws. Nevertheless, most of the constitutional concerns are identical.\nOur system of criminal justice recognizes that, once one's debt to society is paid, the offender has compensated\nthe state for his or her wrongdoing and has earned a place back in society. See Doe v. Poritz, 142 N.J. 1, 662\nA.2d 367, 372 (1995) (expressing \"fundamental belief that criminals, convicted and punished, have paid their\ndebt to society and are not to be punished further\"). This principle, coupled with the presumption of innocence,\ngives rise to an expectation that the individual will not be subjected to sanction unless he or she is again\nconvicted of a breach of our criminal law. Yet, belief in the payment-in-full principle is idealistic. The idea runs\ncounter to our recognition that convicted felons constitutionally may be prohibited from engaging in many\nactivities enjoyed by society at large, such as exercising the right to vote. Thus, the notion that the mark of\ntransgression is erased by payment of one's debt, whatever the form, is dispelled by our treatment of convicted\nfelons.\nInitially the Complaint was brought against Ronald Marcotte, the police chief of the town in which the plaintiff\ncurrently resides. Subsequently the plaintiff discontinued suit against Chief Marcotte. Insofar as the plaintiff's\ncurrent, second amended Complaint seeks to declare unconstitutional the provisions of ยง 54-102r, as amended,\nthat authorize disclosure of certain information by chiefs of police or resident state troopers, there is no\ninformation in the record regarding the applicability of this statute to the plaintiff. While a plaintiff need not \"await\nthe consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventative relief,\" Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553,\n593, 43 S.Ct. 658, 664, 67 L.Ed. 1117 (1923), the law by its terms does not apply to the plaintiff, and there is no\nindication that it has been or will be applied to him. Accordingly, the remainder of this Opinion will be directed at\nthe actions of the current defendants only. The court does not pass upon Conn.Gen.Stat. ยง 54-102r as amended\nby ยง 10 of Public Act No. 95-142 and expresses no opinion on its constitutional validity.\nA. The Standard\nThis court may grant a preliminary injunction only if the moving party demonstrates a risk of irreparable harm and\neither (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, or (2) the existence of sufficiently serious questions going to the\nmerits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships decidedly favoring the party seeking\nrelief. See, e.g., Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Prods., 60 F.3d 964, 967 (2d Cir.1995); McNeilab, Inc. v.\nAmerican Home Products Corp., 848 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Cir.1988); Johnson v. Kay, 860 F.2d 529, 540 (2d Cir.1988); \nJackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1979) (per curiam). The second ground for\ninterim relief, termed the \"fair-ground-for-litigation\" prong, \"may not be considered `where the moving party seeks\nto stay governmental action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme.'\" NAACP v.\nTown of East Haven, 70 F.3d 219, 223 (2d Cir.1995) (quoting Plaza Health Labs., Inc. v. Perales, 878 F.2d 577,\n580 (2d Cir.1989)).\n\nA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary measure, and the burden on a party seeking such relief is substantial.\nAs stated above, the moving party must first demonstrate \"irreparable harm.\" Serious questions going to the\nmerits, standing alone, do not justify injunctive relief. \"There must also be a showing of irreparable harm, the\nabsence of an adequate remedy at law, which is the sine qua non for the grant of such equitable relief.\" Buffalo\nForge Co. v. Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., 638 F.2d 568, 569 (2d Cir.1981). Where, as in this case, a movant alleges\nthe deprivation of a constitutional right, the movant satisfies this predicate, see Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 77\n(2d Cir. 1992), subject to the additional requirement that the threatened harm must be \"actual and imminent\" and\n\"not remote or speculative.\" State of New York v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 550 F.2d 745, 755 (2d Cir.\n1977).\n1087 *1087 Moreover, if \"the grant of the [preliminary relief] will give the movant essentially all the relief he seeks, the\ninjunction is often deemed mandatory rather than prohibitory, and a somewhat higher standard is applied, under\nwhich the movant must show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, rather than merely a likelihood of\nsuccess.\" Johnson v. Kay, 860 F.2d 529, 540 (2d Cir.1988); see also Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1025\n(2d Cir.1985).\nB. The Law\nPlaintiff's Complaint is brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, which provides a remedy against \"any person\" who\ndeprives another of rights protection by the Constitution or laws of the United States under color of state law. The\nanalysis of plaintiff's claims begins with the acknowledgment that \"[s]ection 1983 `is not itself a source of\nsubstantive rights,' but merely provides `a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.'\" Albright v.\nOliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S.Ct. 807, 811, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (quoting Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137,\n144 n. 3, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2694 n. 3, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979)). To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a complaint\nmust allege that the defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived the plaintiff of a right secured by the\nConstitution or laws of the United States. Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 638, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1922-23,\n1923-24, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980); Costello v. Town of Fairfield, 811 F.2d 782, 784 (2d Cir.1987). \"The first step in\nany such claim is to identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed.\" Albright, 510 U.S. at 271, 114\nS.Ct. at 811. In this case, plaintiff's claims are based on alleged violations of the Due Process and Equal\nProtection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the Double Jeopardy Clause of\n[4]\nthe Fifth Amendment.  Because the court determines that retroactive application of the Guidelines offends the \nEx Post Facto Clause, it does not reach the other constitutional concerns raised by the plaintiff.\nC. Analysis\nPlaintiff alleges that Public Act No. 95-142 is an unconstitutional ex post facto law as it has been applied to him\nthrough OAP's Guidelines. He alleges that the application of the law to him is ex post facto because the\nGuidelines operate retroactively in a manner that disadvantages the plaintiff. Moreover, Roe contends that the\n\"broad discretionary public notification permitted by the Act constitutes punishment in that it subjects plaintiff to\n`public stigma and ostracism that would affect both [his] personal and professional life.'\" (Pl.'s Mem. at 23). The\nState responds by arguing that the Guidelines do not amount to a \"law\" within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto\nClause and, even if they do, the notification provisions do not constitute punishment.\nThe Constitution prohibits the States from passing any \"ex post facto Law.\" U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 10. \"The\nprohibition against ex post facto laws embodies two principal concerns. First, it helps to prevent legislative\nabuses by curbing the `enact[ment of] arbitrary or vindictive legislation.' Second, it helps `to assure that\nlegislative Acts give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly\nchanged.'\" United States v. Meeks, 25 F.3d 1117, 1118-19 (2d Cir.1994) (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\nTo argue, as the State does here, that the Guidelines are not laws within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto\nClause ignores the issue. If a State can delegate to an agency the ability to establish what are in effect ex post\nfacto laws and thereby insulate the State action from constitutional scrutiny, the Clause itself would be rendered\n\n1088 meaningless.[5] The State relies on DiNapoli v.*1088Northeast Regional Parole Comm'n, 764 F.2d 143 (2d Cir.),\ncert. denied,474 U.S. 1020, 106 S.Ct. 568, 88 L.Ed.2d 553 (1985), for the proposition that the Guidelines are not\n\"laws\" for purposes of ex post facto analysis. That case, however, is inapposite. In DiNapoli, the Second Circuit\nrecognized that mere \"guideposts\" which assist a federal agency in exercising discretion are not to be equated\nwith law. Significantly, the court noted that \"`these guidelines [do not] have the characteristics of law. They are not\nfixed and rigid, but are flexible.'\" Id. at 146 (quoting Ruip v. United States, 555 F.2d 1331, 1335 (6th Cir.1977)).\nThe Guidelines at issue in this case, however, are rigid; they do not purport to focus discretion or otherwise serve\nmerely to inform the user. They are commands and, as such, they represent the official policy of the State of\nConnecticut, even though they arguably subvert that policy in their retrospective application. See Akins v. Snow,\n922 F.2d 1558, 1561 (11th Cir.) (holding regulations having \"force and effect of law\" are laws for ex post facto\n[6]\npurposes), cert. denied,501 U.S. 1260, 111 S.Ct. 2915, 115 L.Ed.2d 1079 (1991).\nTreating the Guidelines as laws for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause therefore is appropriate, but the\nexercise brings to light significant differences between the Connecticut General Assembly's intent and the actions\nof the OAP. The court assumes that, in passing the notification provisions of ยง 54-102r, as amended, the General\nAssembly knew of the potential constitutional implications of applying the law retroactively. Indeed, the retroactive\napplication of any sanction implicates the Ex Post Facto Clause, which embodies a host of concerns considered\nso fundamental to the Framers that it was singled out explicitly as a direct restraint on the legislative autonomy of\n[7]\nthe States entering the newly formed Union.  Unlike other states, Connecticut decidedly voiced its will that the\nlaw was to be applied only prospectively. An ex post facto challenge to the law per se, therefore, would be\nmeaningless. The defendants' unilateral decision to apply the Guidelines retroactively, however, has resurrected\nan issue already laid to rest by the Connecticut General Assembly.\nThe range of the Ex Post Facto Clause was first explored by the Supreme Court in Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.)\n[8]\n386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798), where the Court identified four categories of laws prohibited as ex post facto.  At issue\nin this case is the third Calder category, which prohibits \"[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a \ngreater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\" Id. at 390. The Court has held that the\nClause \"is aimed at laws that `retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal\nacts.'\" California Dep't of Corrections v. Morales, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1601, 131 L.Ed.2d 588\n1089 (1995) (quoting Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 43, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2719, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 *1089 (1990)).\n\"With respect to retroactivity, `[t]he critical question is whether the law changes the legal consequences of acts\ncompleted before its effective date.'\" United States v. Meeks, 25 F.3d 1117, 1119 (2d Cir.1994) (quoting Weaver\nv. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 31, 101 S.Ct. 960, 965, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981)).\nPlaintiff here does not claim that the Guidelines alter the definition of his crimes, so to prevail on this issue he\n[9]\nmust show that the nature of his punishment has been increased by virtue of the notification provisions.  The\nparties seem to be in agreement that this issue of whether notification constitutes punishment is the threshold\nand defining inquiry. See Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 95-96, 78 S.Ct. 590, 595-96, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958)\n(plurality) (Ex Post Facto Clause applies \"only to statutes imposing penalties\"). They differ in their estimation of\nhow this inquiry should be resolved.\nThe State argues that a court's focus in reviewing a law challenged as ex post facto is limited to a view of the\ngoal of the legislation as punitive or remedial and, if remedial, an examination of the linkage between the scheme\nand the remedial end. Assuming a tight linkage, incidental punitive aspects of a remedial law are overlooked. The\nState's argument is not without support.\nIn Trop v. Dulles, the Court observed:\nIf the statute imposes a disability for the purposes of punishment 00 that is, to reprimand the\n97\nwrongdoer, to deter others, etc. 00 it has been considered penal. But a statute has been\n97\nconsidered nonpenal if it imposes a disability, not to punish, but to accomplish some other\nlegitimate governmental purpose.\n\n356 U.S. at 96, 78 S.Ct. at 595-96 (citation and footnotes omitted). Faced with the possibility that a given statute\nmay have both a penal and a nonpenal result, the Court directed inquiry to the \"evident purpose\" of the\nlegislation:\nThe point may be illustrated by the situation of an ordinary felon. A person who commits a bank\nrobbery, for instance, loses his right to liberty and often his right to vote. If, in the exercise of the\npower to protect banks, both sanctions were imposed for the purpose of punishing bank robbers,\nthe statutes authorizing both disabilities would be penal. But because the purpose of the latter\nstatute is to designate a reasonable ground of eligibility for voting, this law is sustained as a\nnonpenal exercise of the power to regulate the franchise.\nId. at 96-97, 78 S.Ct. at 596 (footnotes omitted). Similarly, in DeVeau v. Braisted, the Court held:\nThe mark of an ex post facto law is the imposition of what can fairly be designated punishment for\npast acts. The question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon\nan individual for prior conduct, is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past\nactivity, or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a\nregulation of a present situation, such as the proper qualifications for a profession.\n363 U.S. 144, 160, 80 S.Ct. 1146, 1155, 4 L.Ed.2d 1109 (1960). In DeVeau, the issue before the Court was the\nvalidity of a law prohibiting organizations from collecting union dues in the Port of New York if any officer or agent\nof the organization was a convicted felon. The Court, through Justice Frankfurter, upheld the law in the face of an\nex-post-facto attack, concluding:\nDuly mindful as we are of the promising record of rehabilitation by ex-felons, and of the emphasis\non rehabilitation by modern penological efforts, it is not for this Court to substitute its judgment for\nthat of Congress and the Legislatures of New York and New Jersey regarding the social surgery\nrequired by a situation as gangrenous as exposure of the New York waterfront had revealed.\n363 U.S. at 158, 80 S.Ct. at 1154.\n1090 Were the analysis to stop at the purpose of the governmental regulation at *1090 issue, the court would have\nserious doubts regarding the plaintiff's ability to prevail on the ex-post-facto issue. If one tenet is clear regarding\nthe proper analytical framework for an ex-post-facto challenge, however, it is the principle that a subjective\nanalysis on either side of the controversy is not appropriate. United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 447 n. 7, 109\nS.Ct. 1892, 1901 n. 7, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989) (noting that from the point of view of a defendant \"even remedial\nsanctions carry the sting of punishment\"); Collins, 497 U.S. at 46, 110 S.Ct. at 2721 (\"Subtle ex post facto\nviolations are no more permissible than overt ones.\"); United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248-49, 100 S.Ct.\n2636, 2641, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980) (holding Court looks past intent to \"purpose or effect\" of legislation); United\nStates v. Huss, 7 F.3d 1444, 1447-48 (9th Cir.1993) (\"legislature may not insulate itself from an ex post facto\nchallenge simply by asserting that a statute's purpose is to regulate rather than punish prior conduct\"). In the final\nanalysis, the State's entire argument is merely one factor in the equation.\nCourts that have invalidated community notification laws on ex post facto grounds have gone beyond the issue of\nlegislative purpose and examined whether the character of the proposed State action amounts to punishment. To\nguide the analysis, courts have applied the factors delineated in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 83\nS.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963). See Doe v. Pataki, 919 F.Supp. 691 (S.D.N.Y.1996); Rowe v. Burton, 884\nF.Supp. 1372, 1378 (D.Alaska 1994). But see Artway v. Attorney General, 81 F.3d 1235 (3d Cir.1996) (rejecting \nMendoza-Martinez factors in ex post facto challenge); Doe v. Poritz, 142 N.J. 1, 662 A.2d 367, 403-04 (1995)\n(same). In Mendoza-Martinez, the Court summarized then-existing tests used to determine whether a statute was\n\"essentially penal in character\" as inquiring into:\nWhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been\nregarded as punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its\noperation will promote the traditional aims of punishment 00 retribution and deterrence, whether the\n97\nbehavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may\n\nrationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the\nalternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing\ndirections. Absent conclusive evidence of congressional intent as to the penal nature of a statute,\nthese factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face.\nMendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. at 567-68 (footnotes omitted). The Court concluded that the\nlegislative history of the statute \"compel[ed] a conclusion that the statute's primary function [was] to serve as an\nadditional penalty for a special category of\" offender. Id. at 169-70, 83 S.Ct. at 568.\nThe State takes issue with the applicability of the Mendoza-Martinez factors to Roe's ex-post-facto challenge in\nthis case. Support for the State's argument is found in an opinion of the Court holding that \"[i]n addressing the\nseparate question whether punishment is being imposed, the Court has not employed the tests articulated in \nMendoza-Martinez and Ward.\" Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 610 n. 6, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 2806 n. 6, 125\nL.Ed.2d 488 (1993). Austin was a civil forfeiture case in which the claimant argued that the Excessive Fines\nClause of the Eighth Amendment restrained the government's ability to forfeit property involved in the\ncommission of an underlying narcoticstrafficking offense. In determining whether the law at issue was remedial or\npunitive for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, the Court applied its holding in Halper, 490 U.S. at 448, 109\nS.Ct. at 1901-02, that \"a civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can\nonly be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come to\nunderstand the term.\" After examining the history of forfeiture, the Court concluded that the practice traditionally\nwas understood as a form of punishment. The Court also noted that Congress viewed the provisions at issue as\n1091 punishment. Given these factors, the Court rejected the argument that the forfeiture provisions at issue *1091\nserved \"solely a remedial purpose.\" Austin, 509 U.S. at 621, 113 S.Ct. at 2812. Under the logic of Halper,\ntherefore, the forfeiture provisions constituted punishment and thus were subject to the Eighth Amendment.\nThe holdings of Halper and Austin, however do not support the approach advocated by the State in this case.\nRather, in Austin for example, the Court explicitly held that it \"need not exclude the possibility that a [sanction]\nserves remedial purposes to conclude that it is\" punishment. 509 U.S. at 610, 113 S.Ct. at 2806. Recognizing\nthat a sanction can serve multiple purposes, the Court will hold punitive those sanctions that \"`can only be\nexplained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes.'\" Id. (quoting Halper, 490 U.S. at 448, 109 S.Ct.\nat 1902).\nCourts addressing ex post facto challenges to community notification laws have wrestled with a universal\ndefinition of punishment that could then be applied across conceptual lines to different constitutional protections.\n[10]\n In reversing the district court in Artway, for example, the Third Circuit attempted a thoughtful synthesis of the\nCourt's cases on the issue of what constitutes punishment. Artway, 81 F.3d at 1263. It is clear after United States\nv. Ursery, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996), that such a synthesis is not possible.\nIn Ursery the Court was faced with a challenge under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to in\nrem forfeitures. Significant for current purposes, the Court cautioned that a \"difference in approach was based in\na significant difference between the purposes of our analysis under each constitutional provision.\" Id. at ___, 116\nS.Ct. at 2146. In rejecting the double jeopardy challenge, the Court ultimately applied a two-pronged test that\nlooked first to legislative intent and second to \"whether the proceedings are so punitive in fact as to `persuade us\nthat the forfeiture proceeding[s] may not legitimately be viewed as civil in nature,' despite Congress' intent.\" Id. at\n___, 116 S.Ct. at 2147 (quoting United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. 354, 366 (1984)). In\nthe end, however, the Court went on to analyze \"[o]ther considerations that we have found relevant to the\nquestion whether a proceeding is criminal.\" Id. at ___, 116 S.Ct. at 2149. These \"other considerations\" consist of:\n(1) an historical analysis of the sanction; (2) whether the government must show scienter as a prerequisite to the\nsanction; (3) whether the sanction serves a criminal goal; and (4) whether the sanction is tied to criminal activity. \nId. at ___, 116 S.Ct. at 2149. These factors bear a substantial similarity to those enumerated in Mendoza-\nMartinez.\nGiven the nature of community notification laws, which casts them in a form quite unlike any previous case,\ndetermining the dispositive issue of punishment can be done only through an approach that takes into account\nthe unique quality of the individual's encounter with the machinery of the State. Cf. Department of Revenue v.\n\nKurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767, ___ - ___, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 1946-47, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994) (enumerating \"unusual\nfeatures\" of state tax on possession of illegal narcotics that led to conclusion that tax was punishment for double\njeopardy purposes); see United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 717 (1st Cir.1996) (holding Halper \"limited to cases\ninvolving fines, forfeitures, and other monetary penalties designed to make the sovereign whole for harm or loss\nthat is quantifiable in actual or approximate monetary terms\"). Because the Mendoza-Martinez analysis examines\nthe nature of what the State is doing to the individual in determining whether a sanction is punitive or remedial, it\nis primarily this framework that should guide the court's inquiry.\nFor the reasons stated below, the court holds that the community notification provisions of the Guidelines\nconstitute punishment, and that their retroactive application to Roe therefore offends the Ex Post Facto Clause of\nthe United States Constitution.\n1092 *1092 The first relevant inquiry involves whether the sanction imposes an affirmative disability or restraint on the\nindividual. Like the courts that have previously considered this issue, this court concludes that the effect of\ncommunity notification does amount to an affirmative disability. See Pataki, 919 F.Supp. at 701; Rowe, 884\nF.Supp. at 1378. Here, unlike regulations restricting an individual's ability to engage in a certain activity or\nprofession, the consequences of the governmental action are unlimited. Notification is an affirmative placement\nby the State of a form of public stigma on Roe, and this stigma by its very nature pervades into every aspect of\nan offender's life. Notifying persons with whom the defendant is involved in his daily life, such as his employer, his\nlandlord and his neighbors, will impede his freedom of movement, thereby controlling his behavior. Notification\nmoreover acts as the catalyst by which Roe's movements can and will be curtailed by the reaction of others.\nIndeed, testimony at the hearing established that the purpose of notification is to modify the behavior of both the\n[11]\noffender and those with whom he comes into contact.  This factor indicates that the Guidelines are punitive.\nSecond, while the court is hesitant to resort to literary paradigms, it cannot be ignored that Judge Politan's\nexamples in the district court's opinion in Artway do demonstrate that the practice of community notification is\nclosely akin to what historically has been viewed as a form of punishment. Artway v. Attorney General, 876\nF.Supp. 666, 689 (D.N.J.1995),rev'd in part and aff'd in part,81 F.3d 1235 (3d Cir.1996); see also Pataki, 919\nF.Supp. at 701. This factor, too, lends support to a view of the Guidelines as punishment.\nThe third factor, whether the governmental action is linked to a finding of scienter, points away from finding the\nGuidelines punitive. Although the governmental action is linked to the offender's culpability for his past unlawful\nconduct, the Guidelines are based on a finding of a propensity to offend in the future and not on a finding of\nscienter as that term is used in Mendoza-Martinez. See Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U.S. 20, 37, 42 S.Ct. 449,\n450, 66 L.Ed. 817 (1922); cf. Austin, 509 U.S. at 617-21, 113 S.Ct. at 2810-11.\nIt is clear from the evidence presented at the hearing in this matter that the purpose of the community notification\npolicy is deterrence, which is a traditional goal of punishment. Pataki, 919 F.Supp. at 701; Rowe, 884 F.Supp. at\n1379. While this factor is by no means dispositive, see Ursery, ___ U.S. at ___, 116 S.Ct. at 2149, the focus of\nthe Guidelines on specific deterrence rather than general deterrence weighs in favor of a punitive sanction.\nMoreover, as found by Judge Chin, community notification laws are by their nature intertwined with behavior that\nis already a crime. Pataki, 919 F.Supp. at 701; see also Rowe, 884 F.Supp. at 1379. We must not forget that the\nreason the Guidelines have been applied to the plaintiff is solely and exclusively his past criminal behavior.\nConsideration of this factor also leads to a finding of punishment.\nThe sixth and seventh factors identified by Mendoza-Martinez are interrelated. Together, they essentially\nconstitute the State's argument in support of the Guidelines, i.e., there is a significant, non-punitive aspect of the\npolicy and the implementation of this aspect is not excessive in relation to any incidental punitive effects. The\ncourt, however, does not agree with the State's conclusion.\n[12]\nThere is no doubt that community notification is intended in part to protect the public from devastating crimes.\nThis goal certainly is one within the traditionally broad police powers of the State. The State, moreover, is\ninsulated to some degree from any unpleasant consequences of notification by the fact that its affirmative acts\n1093 are limited to the provision of information to the public. Yet *1093 there can be no question that the State's\ninterest in the plaintiff exists solely because of the particular nature of his past criminal conduct.\n\nThe punitive effects of community notification, however, are not merely incidental to an overriding non-punitive\npurpose. Cf. United States v. Hernandez-Fundora, 58 F.3d 802, 806 (2d Cir.) (\"[T]he mere fact that a sanction ...\nhas a punitive component does not mean that the sanction constitutes `punishment' for double jeopardy\npurposes.\"), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 2288, 132 L.Ed.2d 290 (1995). In fact, the linkage between\ncommunity notification and the particularity of the conduct to which it applies lead to the conclusion that there is\nno way to distinguish the punitive from non-punitive effects. In the end, there is nothing to the State regulation\nother than the singling out of individuals based on their past crimes.\nThere is further reason to question the purported link between remedial goals (reduction of recidivism) and\nmeans (community notification) in this case. The Guidelines at issue here purport to establish two levels of\nnotification. The first level turns on a clinical assessment concluding that the probationer is a \"high risk sex\noffender.\" (Second Am.Compl.Ex. C, at 1). If such an assessment is made, notification is given to a certain class\nof individuals. To trigger the second level of notification one must, again through clinical assessment, be\nclassified as a \"pedophile, predatory rapist[] [or] other extreme case[].\" Id. Mr. D'Amora, one of defendants'\nexperts at the hearing, testified that there was no way for a clinician to classify an individual as an \"extreme case\n[]\" without some guidance regarding the underlying criteria. Mr. Santese, OAP's Deputy Director, resolved this\nseemingly impossible task by clarifying that a \"high risk\" case under the first tier of notification would also\nconstitute an \"extreme case\" under the second tier. Based on Mr. Santese's testimony, there essentially is no\ndifference between the two levels of notification under the Guidelines. Thus, the characterization of the system by\nthe State as one exhibiting a tight fit between means and ends does not withstand analysis.\nThe court is well aware that this case involves the State's management of its probation system. Probation itself is\nclearly a form of punishment, control over which has been recognized by the Court as a \"special need\" of the\nState warranting otherwise intolerable intrusions into areas protected by the Constitution. See Griffin v.\n[13]\nWisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3169, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987).  In the prison-management\ncontext, the Second Circuit has remarked on the peculiar entanglement of punitive and remedial interests in any\ngiven State policy. See Hernandez-Fundora, 58 F.3d at 806. Nevertheless, the operation of a probation system\ndoes not grant the State a license to dispense with constitutional rights.\nThe concept of notice is fundamental to our system of justice. Albeit in a different context, the Court recently\naffirmed the importance of the role of notice in our constitutional law.\nElementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person\nreceive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment but also of the\nseverity of the penalty that a State may impose.\nBMW of North America v. Gore, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 1598, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). It is precisely\nbecause the notification scheme at issue in this case is so inextricably interwoven with the criminal justice system\nthat it warrants a searching inquiry under the Ex Post Facto Clause. When the plaintiff committed his crimes, and\n1094 even when the plaintiff was sentenced,[14] the *1094 State of Connecticut had an arsenal of potential sanctions\nto which the plaintiff could be exposed. Community notification was not within that arsenal. It is only today, years\nafter his offenses, that the plaintiff is subject to this sanction, and it is only after an Act passed by the Connecticut\nGeneral Assembly made it a possibility.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, and on the basis of the record before the court, the court is persuaded that the\nplaintiff has adequately alleged a risk of irreparable harm and that he has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of the ex post facto claim. Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction (document # 12)\ntherefore is GRANTED, and it is hereby\nORDERED that the defendants, their successors in office and all those acting in concert with them are hereby\nENJOINED from applying the Sex Offender Notification Policy to the plaintiff, and it is\n\nFURTHER ORDERED that this Order shall remain in full force and effect until further, express order of this court.\nIt is so ordered.\n[1] The law covers the following offenses: Conn. Gen.Stat. ยง 53-21(2), as amended by ยง 1 of Public Act No.\n95-142 (injury or risk of injury to children); 53a-70 (sexual assault in the first degree); 53a-70a (aggravated sexual\nassault in the first degree); 53a-70b (sexual assault in a spousal or cohabitating relationship); 53a-71 (sexual\nassault in the second degree); 53a-72a (sexual assault in the third degree); and 53a-72b (sexual assault in the\nthird degree with a firearm).\n[2] Cormier mailed the information to the victims and the plaintiff's family on December 26, 1995. (Cormier Dep.,\nfiling 42, at 54-55). The information was facsimilied to plaintiff's employer and to the manager of plaintiff's\napartment building at some point after Cormier learned that Roe had filed this action. (Id. at 58).\n[3] Plaintiff filed a third application for a temporary restraining order on February 14, 1996, in which he sought an\norder barring the defendants' attempt to modify the conditions of plaintiff's probation based on information\nobtained by the defendants through plaintiff's deposition. The court denied this application after a hearing on\nFebruary 14.\n[4] The initial Complaint alleged a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual\npunishment. The plaintiff has not pursued this claim in the current, Second Amended Complaint, however, and\nthe issue has not been briefed or otherwise asserted by the plaintiff in litigating the instant motion. This claim,\ntherefore, will not be considered by the court.\n[5] Judicial approval of such a practice would render a clear and paramount constitutional command \"little more\nthan good advice.\" Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 269, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 2741-42, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972)\n(Brennan, J., concurring) (discussing Eighth Amendment).\n[6] Defendants concede that ยง 6(c) \"does constitute legislative recognition and authorization for the OAP policies\nwhich prompted disclosure in the plaintiff's case.\" Defs.' Mem., filing 46, at 7.\n[7] Chief Justice Marshall wrote of this particular intrusion on State sovereignty in Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6\nCranch.) 87, 137-38, 3 L.Ed. 162 (1810): \nWhatever respect might have been felt for the state sovereignties, it is not to be disguised that the framers of the\nconstitution viewed, with some apprehension, the violent acts which might grow out of the feelings of the\nmoment; and that the people of the United States, in adopting that instrument, have manifested a determination\nto shield themselves and their property from the effects of those sudden and strong passions to which men are\nexposed. The restrictions on the legislative power of the states are obviously founded in this sentiment; and the\nconstitution of the United States contains what may be deemed a bill of rights for the people of each state.\n[8] \"1st. Every law that makes an action, done before the passing of the law; and which was innocent when done,\ncriminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when\ncommitted. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed\nto the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or\ndifferent, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense, in order to convict the\noffender.\" Calder, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) at 390.\n[9] Contrary to plaintiff's understanding, the Court has soundly rejected any connection between the Clause and\nlaws that merely \"disadvantage\" an individual. Morales, ___ U.S. at ___ n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1602 n. 3.\n[10]Mendoza-Martinez itself involved not the Ex Post Facto Clause but the applicability of an individual's Fifth\nand Sixth Amendment rights to a proceeding divesting the individual of citizenship. The Third Circuit questioned\nthe assumption \"that `punishment' for purposes of one constitutional protection is necessarily `punishment' for\nanother.\" Artway, 81 F.3d at 1258.\n[11]See note 12, infra.\n\n[12] At the hearing the State also presented evidence that community notification is linked to the treatment of sex\noffenders. While the imposition of so-called external controls on an offender may not be inconsistent with\ntreatment goals, this does not alter the fact that it is a state-imposed sanction at issue in this case.\n[13]Griffin arose in the Fourth Amendment context. Unlike the Fourth Amendment, the scope of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause is not defined in terms of reasonableness. The latter prohibition is absolute.\n[14] In terms of balancing equities, the breach of plea agreement argument certainly is the most compelling from\nthe perspective of an individual who is forced to succumb to a policy instituted by the State so long after a plea of\nguilty is entered. The court is of the opinion, however, that this issue cannot be heard in this forum in the first\ninstance. Plaintiff presents this claim under the ambit of a breach of contract. He does not specify the relief\nrequested in connection with the plea-agreement claim. If the relief contemplated is an injunction directing the\nSuperior Court to allow the plaintiff to withdraw the plea, or ordering the conviction set aside, the appropriate\nrelief would be obtainable only through the writ of habeas corpus. Viewing the claim in this manner, the relief\nwould be foreclosed by plaintiff's failure to present this claim to the courts of the State of Connecticut. See Heck\nv. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, ___, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2369, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509,\n102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). \nExamining the claim as a species of plaintiff's due process cause of action, and thus capturing the potential for\nmonetary relief for violation of the plea agreement, the procedural posture of this case would warrant a finding\nthat the damage remedy, which tenuously secures plaintiff's jurisdictional grasp, precludes interim relief. But see\n1-95-CV-553-P1 v. 1-95-CV-553-D1, 75 F.3d 135, 136 (2d Cir.1996) (\"the only remedies available for breach of\nplea agreement are enforcement of the agreement or affording the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the\nplea\"). In any event, the validity of such a due process claim is called into question by the Court's holding in \nHumphrey, supra, wherein the Court held that \"to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or\nimprisonment ... a ยง 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,\nexpunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or\ncalled into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\" 512 U.S at ___, 114 S.Ct. at 2372.\nIn sum, to the extent Roe advances this theory as an attack on the validity of his plea agreement with the State of\nConnecticut, his remedy in federal court is limited to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and in this case there\nis no indication that the plaintiff has presented his claim in a state forum. Viewed as a claim for damages arising\nfrom the breach, Roe's claim is altogether precluded.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

NEWMAN Circuit Judge.\nIn Doe v. Pataki, 120 F.3d 1263 (2d Cir.1997), we upheld, as against a challenge under the Ex Post Facto\nClause, the constitutionality of the registration and notification provisions of New York's version of \"Megan's Law,\"\n[1]\nwhich requires varying degrees of community notification about released sex offenders.  On this appeal we\nconsider a similar challenge to a recently adopted notification policy of Connecticut's Office of Adult Probation\n(\"OAP\"). The specific issue is whether the OAP policy imposes \"punishment\" for purposes of the Ex Post Facto\nClause, in which event it could not be applied to probationers who committed crimes before adoption of the\npolicy. This issue arises on an appeal by the OAP and several of its officials from the August 27, 1996, order of\nthe District Court for the District of Connecticut (Dominic J. Squatrito, Judge), preliminarily enjoining the\ndefendants from applying the OAP's Sex Offender Notification Policy (\"the Policy\") to plaintiff Robert Roe, who\nwas convicted of several sex crimes in 1991. See Roe v. Office of Adult Probation, 938 F.Supp. 1080\n(D.Conn.1996). In light of our recent decision in Doe v. Pataki, supra, we rule that notification pursuant to the\nPolicy does not constitute punishment for purposes of ex post facto analysis. We therefore reverse the District\nCourt's order and remand for further proceedings on Roe's remaining claims.\nBackground\nUnlike most recent cases involving ex post facto challenges to community notification laws, the target of attack in\nthis case is not a state statute, but an internal policy of a state agency. Nonetheless, because the OAP Policy is\nsomewhat intertwined with, and perhaps partially authorized by, several recently enacted Connecticut statutes,\nwe begin by examining the relevant legislation.\n1. Connecticut's Registration and Notification Scheme\nIn response to similar concerns regarding the harm to society caused by sex crimes and the relatively high rate of\nrecidivism among sex offenders, which have prompted the enactment of sex offender registration and notification\n\nstatutes around the country, Connecticut has recently enacted its own version of \"Megan's Law.\" The first step\noccurred in 1994, when the state legislature enacted a registration scheme for convicted sex offenders. See Act\nof June 9, 1994 (\"1994 Act\"), P.A. No. 94-246, 1994 Conn. Legis. Serv. 974 (West 1994). The 1994 Act applied\nonly to individuals convicted after January 1, 1995, of \"sexual assault,\" which includes the following seven\noffenses: aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the\nsecond degree, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, sexual\nassault in a spousal or cohabitating relationship, and injury or risk of injury to a minor. See Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann.\n49 ยง 54-102r(a)(1)(A), (b), (c).[2] The law required *49 these offenders to provide certain registration information to\n[3]\nlaw enforcement officials, including name, address,  social security number, information about the crime of\nconviction, and a \"complete description of the person including photograph and fingerprints.\" Id. ยง 54-102r(e).\nThe 1994 Act, in addition to requiring registration, provided for minimal notification of information. Registration\ninformation could be disclosed only to \"the custodian of such records or a sworn law enforcement officer, in the\nperformance of his duties.\" P.A. No. 94-246, ยง 12(c).\nIn 1995, the Connecticut legislature amended section 54-102r to broaden notification significantly. See Act of May\n30, 1995 (\"1995 Act\"), P.A. No. 95-142, 1995 Conn. Legis. Serv. 312 (West 1995). Section 10(g) of the 1995 Act\nappeared to permit (by exempting from a disclosure prohibition) the disclosure of registration information \"to any\nspecific person if such disclosure is deemed necessary by the chief of police of the police department or resident\nstate trooper of the municipality to protect said person from any person subject to\" registration. Id. ยง 10(g)\n(codified at Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยง 54-102r(g)); see also id. (providing that any person disclosing registration\ninformation in violation of this section \"shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor\"). Like the registration statute\nenacted in 1994, the 1995 Act, which became effective on October 1, 1995, applied only to persons convicted of\n\"sexual assault\" (as that term is defined in subsection 54-102r(a)(1) of the Connecticut General Statutes) on or\n[4]\nafter January 1, 1995. See id. ยง 10(a)-(c) (codified at Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยง 54-102r(a)-(c)).  Thus, the 1995\nAct had a limited retroactive effect 00 it applied to persons who committed sex crimes at any time prior to October\n97\n1, 1995 (the effective date of the 1995 Act), if they were convicted after January 1, 1995.\nIn 1997, after the District Court's decision in this case, the Connecticut legislature amended section 54-102r in\ntwo respects. See Act of June 26, 1997 (\"the 1997 Act\"), P.A. No. 97-183, 1997 Conn. Legis. Serv. 377 (West\n1997). First, the 1997 Act deleted the January 1, 1995, date, which had limited the coverage of the registration\nrequirements of section 54-102r(b), (c), thereby requiring registration regardless of the date of conviction.\nSecond, the 1997 Act deleted the disclosure prohibition of section 54-102r(g), thereby arguably authorizing\nunlimited disclosure. This deletion also eliminated the provision of section 54-102r(g) making unauthorized\ndisclosure a misdemeanor.\nEspecially relevant to the present dispute is the 1995 Act's provisions concerning the role and duty of probation\nofficers. Section 6(b) provides that any sex offender sentenced to probation must \"immediately notify his ...\nprobation officer ... whenever he changes his residence address,\" id. ยง 6(b) (codified at Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยง\n54-102s(b)), and requires the probation officer so informed to \"notify the chief of police of the police department\nor resident state trooper for the municipality of the new address of the ... probationer and any other law\nenforcement official he deems appropriate.\" Id. Section 6(c) of the 1995 Act then arguably authorizes broad\ndisclosure by providing:\nNothing in this section or section 54-102r of the general statutes, as amended by section 10 of this\nact, shall be construed to prohibit a ... probation officer acting in the performance of his duties and\nwithin the scope of his employment from disclosing any information concerning the ... probationer\nto any person whenever he deems such disclosure to be appropriate.\nId. ยง 6(c) (codified at Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยง 54-102s(c)) (emphasis added).\n50  2. The OAP Policy\n*50\nPrior to 1995, the OAP had no policy or practice of notifying the general public of the criminal record of a\nprobationer under its supervision. In the fall of 1995, the OAP promulgated a policy on sex offender notification\n\nprocedures. See OAP Sex Offender Notification Policy (1995) (\"the Policy\"). The application of the Policy to the\nplaintiff is the focus of the pending lawsuit.\nThe Policy became effective on October 1, 1995. See Memorandum from Michael E. Santese to Chief Probation\nOfficers (Sept. 29, 1995). Its stated objective is \"to enhance public safety and awareness.\" Policy at 1. Neither\nthe coverage nor the operation of the Policy is entirely clear. In terms, the Policy applies to three categories of\noffenders under the supervision of the OAP: (1) persons convicted after January 1, 1995, of \"sexual assault\" (as\ndefined by subsection 54-102r(a)(1)(A) of the Connecticut General Statutes), (2) persons convicted of \"similar\noffenses in other states and transferred to Connecticut via the Interstate Compact,\" and (3) \"[a]ny other person[]\n... determined through clinical assessment to be a high risk sex offender,\" id.\n[5]\nThe first category is explicitly limited to those convicted after January 1, 1995. Whether the second  and third\ncategories were intended to be so limited is not clear. What is clear, and relevant to this case, is that the OAP has\ninterpreted the third category to apply to probationers without regard to their dates of conviction. See\nMemorandum of Michael Santese to Robert Bosco[e], Nov. 20, 1995. Using that interpretation, the OAP has\napplied the third category to the plaintiff in this case, whose conviction occurred prior to January 1, 1995. Plaintiff\ndoes not dispute this interpretation of the Policy; indeed, it is that interpretation that creates his ex post facto\nchallenge.\nThe Policy prescribes two levels of notification, purportedly correlated to the offender's risk of re-offense. The first\nlevel applies to all probationers meeting only the minimum criterion 00 conviction of a listed sex offense. Policy at\n97\n3. As to such probationers, the OAP will disseminate various information concerning the offender, including his\nname, address, physical description, crime of conviction, sentencing, and special conditions of probation. Id. The\ninformation will be disclosed to specified members of the community, including victims of the offender's crime,\nvictims' parents or guardians, the police, the offender's immediate family members, other occupants of the\n[6]\noffender's residence or apartment, and treatment providers.\nThe second, more extensive type of notification applies only to sex offenders who are \"[d]etermined by clinical\nassessment\" to fall within the category of \"pedophiles, predatory rapists and other extreme cases.\" Id. at 1. For\nsuch persons, the OAP will provide information regarding their identity, background, and address not only to the\npreviously mentioned recipients, but also to the offender's immediate neighbors, local schools, local day care\nproviders, the offender's employer, officials of organizations in which the offender participates, and \"Other At Risk\nGroups due to [the offender's] activities and/or proximity ([e.g.,] Scouts; Senior Citizen groups).\" Id.\nThis enhanced degree of notification for \"extreme cases\" applies to offenders, like plaintiff, who are in the third\ncategory of probationers, i.e., those \"determined through clinical assessment to be a high risk sex offender.\" Id.;\nTranscript of Hearing, Feb. 29, 1996, at 88-90 (testimony of Michael Santese) (stating that terms like \"extreme\ncase\" and \"high risk\" all \"basically mean the same thing\"). Though there is some question whether the Policy, as\n51 written, was intended to apply its enhanced level of notification to \"pedophiles, predatory rapists and *51 other\nextreme cases\" convicted before January 1, 1995, the OAP has interpreted the Policy to make the enhanced\nlevel of notification applicable to such probationers and, pertinent to this case, to probationers like plaintiff who\nare in the \"high risk\" category, regardless of their dates of conviction. Memorandum from Michael Santese to\nprobation officers, Dec. 26, 1995, at 1 (\"Sex Offenders sentenced before 1/1/95 are also subject to notification,\nbut only if they have been determined to be a pedophile, predatory rapist, or other extremely high risk case.\").\nThe determination of \"extreme case\" or \"high risk\" must be made by a treatment provider after conducting a\nclinical assessment. Clinical assessments of probationers are conducted by mental health counsellors employed\nby The Connections, Inc., a private nonprofit corporation under contract to the OAP. Although neither the OAP\nnor The Connections has promulgated criteria by which to determine whether a probationer qualifies as a \"high\nrisk\" offender or a \"pedophile[], predatory rapist[,] or other extreme case[],\" an employee of The Connections\ntestified in the District Court that a sex offender's risk of re-offending is determined by ten to thirteen variables,\nincluding the offender's degree of denial, the number of prior offenses, the nature of the offenses, the number of\nvictims, and the age of the victims. Transcript of Hearing, Feb. 29, 1996, at 3-4 (testimony of David D'Amora).\n\nThe OAP has not established any procedures through which a probationer can challenge or appeal an\nunfavorable clinical assessment or a decision by his probation officer to provide notification to persons perceived\nto be at risk from the offender. Moreover, the OAP considers its Policy \"minimum requirements\" that may be\nexceeded when individual probation officers determine, \"in their professional judgment[,] [that] it is necessary to\n[do so] to prevent or reduce the risk of the sex offender re-offending.\" Policy at 3.\n3. Prior Proceedings\nPlaintiff Roe was convicted in 1991 of six counts of sexual assault in the second degree and six counts of risk of\ninjury to a minor. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve years, with execution suspended after\nsix years, and a consecutive five-year term of probation. At least one article detailing Roe's offenses and\nconviction was published in a local newspaper at the time of sentencing. Roe remained incarcerated until August\n1994, when he was released on parole. Approximately three or four months later, Roe's parole was revoked\nwhen he violated a condition of parole by inviting a boy under the age of sixteen to his home. Roe was thereafter\nreturned to prison to complete his sentence.\nRoe was released from prison in August 1995 and, pursuant to the probation component of his sentence, placed\nunder the supervision of the OAP. Defendant Ronald Cormier is plaintiff's probation officer. The other defendants\nare also employees of the OAP: Robert Boscoe is the OAP's director, Michael Santese is the OAP's deputy\ndirector of operations, and Donald Popillo is Cormier's supervisor.\nIn November 1995, Cormier informed Roe that he was a candidate for notification pursuant to the newly adopted\nPolicy and ordered him to meet with William Hobson, a mental health counsellor employed by The Connections.\nAlthough not a psychologist or psychiatrist, Hobson has extensive experience in the field of treatment of sexual\n[7]\noffenders and has written several articles and book chapters in this area.  After conducting a one hour clinical\ninterview with Roe, reviewing his probation records and parole board evaluation, and speaking with his regular\ntherapist, Hobson concluded that Roe \"poses a significant risk to reoffend.\" See Clinical Assessment of Roe,\nDec. 20, 1995, at 3. Based on this determination, Cormier informed Roe that he would conduct community\n52 notification pursuant to the Guidelines because Roe qualified as a \"high risk *52 sex offender\" under the third\n[8]\ncategory of persons subject to the Policy's operation.\nRoe filed the present suit in January 1996, claiming that the OAP's decision to notify the public of his identity,\nbackground, and whereabouts constitutes punishment in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, deprives him of\ndue process, violates equal protection, puts him twice in jeopardy for the same offense, infringes upon his right to\nprivacy, and violates his plea agreement. Although the District Court issued a temporary restraining order in early\nJanuary, Cormier had already faxed information concerning Roe to his building manager and his employer by that\ntime. According to Roe, he has been asked to leave his place of residence by his landlord and has been\nostracized at his place of employment as a result of Cormier's notification. However, the District Court made no\nfactual findings in this regard.\nAlthough Roe requested the District Court to declare unconstitutional Connecticut's community notification \nstatute, see Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยงยง 54-102r, 54-102s (the 1994 Act as amended by the 1995 Act), the Court\nconcluded that because Roe was not convicted of a listed offense on or after January 1, 1995, the \"law by its\n[9]\nterms does not apply to the plaintiff.\" Roe, 938 F.Supp. at 1086. The Court therefore did not pass on the\nconstitutional validity of any state law and focused its analysis exclusively on the OAP's Policy. Applying each of\nthe seven considerations listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644\n[10]\n(1963) to the facts of this case,  Judge Squatrito concluded that the community notification provisions of the\nPolicy constitute punishment, and, therefore, that their application to Roe, who committed his crimes prior to the\nadoption of the Policy, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. The District Court did not reach Roe's remaining\ncontentions.\n\nDiscussion\nOn this appeal, the parties have tendered the sole issue of whether notification conducted pursuant to the Policy\nof the OAP \"increase[s] the punishment for criminal acts,\" such that its application to Roe, who committed his\noffense prior to the Policy's issuance, would violate the ex post facto prohibition. See Collins v. Youngblood, 497\nU.S. 37, 43, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2720, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990). Preliminarily, we have some doubts as to whether that\nconstitutional issue requires decision in this case. Those doubts arise from unresolved issues of state law, based\non two contentions of the defendants.\nFirst, on this appeal, counsel for the defendants contend that the Policy was \"prompted in part by the adoption of\"\nthe 1995 Act, and that \"authority\" for the Policy \"is evidenced, in part, by the provisions\" of the 1995 Act, quoted\nabove, making clear that the 1995 Act does not prohibit disclosure by a probation officer \"whenever he deems\nsuch disclosure to be appropriate.\" See Brief for Appellants at 6. To the extent that the Policy draws its authority\nfrom the 1995 Act, a state law issue arises as to whether the Policy applies to Roe, since that act applied only to\nthose convicted after January 1, 1995. To whatever extent the Policy might be validated by the 1997 Act, this\nstate law issue has been altered, and arguably removed, by the 1997 Act's elimination of the January 1, 1995,\ndate limitation.\n53 *53 Second, at the injunction hearing, the State took the position that the challenged notification was authorized\nby state law prior to issuance of the OAP's Policy. The OAP's deputy director for operations testified that Cormier\nwas entitled, in the exercise of his (presumably statutory) authority as a probation officer, to make the notification\nof which plaintiff complains. See Transcript of February 29, 1996, Hearing at 94-95 (testimony of Michael\n[11]\nSantese).  Counsel for the State defendants also contended that Cormier's notification was authorized without\nregard to the Policy. Arguing from caselaw that he asserted exposes a public officer to liability for a person's\ninjuries when the officer knows of, but fails to advise a person of, a risk of such injuries, counsel said he did not\n[12]\n\"think anybody needs a statute authorizing them to warn somebody who is in danger.\"  Transcript of Feb. 29,\n1996, hearing at 36. To the extent that the notification challenged by Roe is independent of the Policy as a matter\nof state law, no retroactivity issue arises.\nThese contentions frame state law issues as to whether state statutes, either the 1995 Act or the statutes\ngoverning probation officers generally, authorize promulgation of the Policy, and, even if not, whether notification\nis a valid implementation of state common law concerning the notification duties of public officers, without regard\n[13]\nto the Policy.  Though resolution of these state law issues adverse to the defendants might render\nunnecessary a decision as to the ex post facto challenge to the Policy, we consider it appropriate to adjudicate\nthe challenge for several reasons. First, the Policy, even if not essential as authority for the notification that\noccurred, was relied on for such notification, and its constitutionality is sufficiently implicated to warrant decision.\nSecond, the injunction on appeal was explicitly grounded on the ex post facto issue. Third, the issue is so clearly\ngoverned by our recent decision in Doe v. Pataki, supra, that resolving the issue requires no consideration of a\nnew constitutional issue. We therefore proceed to the merits of the ex post facto issue.\nWe use the same two stage analysis we applied in Doe v. Pataki, 120 F.3d at 1274-75, as instructed by the\nSupreme Court, see Kansas v. Hendricks, ___ U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 2081-82, 138 L.Ed.2d 501\n(1997); United States v. Ursery, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 2147, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996); United States\nv. Certain Funds, 96 F.3d 20, 26 (2d Cir.1996).\n1. Intent\nTurning first to the OAP's intent in adopting the Policy, we conclude that the OAP's primary intent in adopting its\nnotification policy was to protect the public from potentially dangerous probationers under its supervision. As the\ntext of the Guidelines states: \"Information on convicted sex offenders will be provided to police, victims and other\nrelevant individuals and organizations in order to enhance public safety and awareness.\" Policy at 1; see also\nDepartmental Message from Don Popillo to Professional Staff, Dec. 1, 1995, at 2 (\"[P]ersons determined to be\n\nhigh risk sex offenders should be subject to this notification process for the protection of the community.\").\n54 Another stated purpose of the notification policy tracks a general statutory responsibility of *54 the OAP: to aid in\nthe rehabilitation of probationers. Cf. Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยงยง 54-105, 54-108. Under this theory, the awareness\nby the probationer's neighbors that he poses a potential danger serves as an external control potentially helpful in\npreventing a relapse. As deputy director Santese summarized, \"The main goal [of public notification] is to get the\nindividual successfully through the period of probation without reoffending and have long-term rehabilitative\n[14]\neffects.\" Id. at 64. Whether or not notification will be effective with respect to either public safety or\nrehabilitation, the OAP was entitled to promulgate policies that it believed would serve these ends.\nWe also conclude that the Policy's \"objective manifestations,\" Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 169, 83 S.Ct. at\n568, indicate that it serves these stated regulatory ends. The Policy does not subject a probationer convicted\nprior to January 1, 1995, to any form of notification, even if he has committed one of the listed offenses, unless\nthere has been an individualized clinical assessment by a treatment provider that the probationer either presents\na \"high risk\" of re-offense or can be regarded as a \"pedophile[], predatory rapist[,][or] other extreme case[].\" This\nclinical assessment is conducted by an independent mental health counsellor, whose only objective is to\ndetermine whether the probationer presents a significant risk of recidivism. No notification will occur for\nprobationers convicted of a listed offense prior to January 1, 1995, if they do not pose such a risk. In sum,\nwhether notification occurs for those convicted before January 1, 1995, depends solely upon the offender's\nperceived risk of re-offense, and not upon the fact of his prior conviction. Moreover, the recipients of notification\nare limited to persons who may be endangered by the high-risk sex offender, for instance other occupants of the\noffender's residence or apartment, immediate neighbors, local schools and day care centers, the offender's\nemployer, and other groups at risk due to the offender's activities or proximity.\nWe conclude that the intent underlying the Policy was regulatory and that any burdens resulting from notification\nare incidental to those nonpunitive purposes. We therefore proceed to the second stage of the inquiry to\ndetermine whether the Policy is punitive in fact.\n2. Punitiveness in Fact\nThe plaintiff bears the \"heavy burden\" of overcoming the regulatory or remedial purpose served by notification, \nsee Hendricks, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 2082, 138 L.Ed.2d 501, a burden that may be sustained only\nby the \"clearest proof\" that notification is \"so punitive in form and effect\" as to render it punitive despite the OAP's\nprospective, regulatory intent, see Ursery, ___ U.S. at ___, 116 S.Ct. at 2148. Several factors combine to indicate\nthat the plaintiff's challenge to Policy cannot satisfy this rigorous standard.\nFirst, as we ruled in Doe v. Pataki, the detrimental effects flowing from a statute will rarely be sufficient to\ntransform an otherwise nonpunitive measure into punishment, especially when the challenged governmental\naction consists solely of the dissemination to selected members of the community of information, nearly all of\nwhich is publicly available. See Doe v. Pataki, 120 F.3d at 1276. Second, notification is not \"tied\" to criminal\nactivity in any significant sense. Although a probationer's prior conviction for a listed sex offense is a necessary\n55 prerequisite for notification, *55 it is not sufficient to trigger it. Rather, the earlier conviction is only one aspect of\nan aggregate assessment of the probationer's potential to re-offend. Third, the Policy is not excessive in relation\nto its purpose of enhancing public awareness and helping to prevent the recovering offender from harmful\nrelapses. Only seven crimes can trigger notification, only persons determined to pose a high risk of re-offense are\nsubject to notification, and only persons potentially endangered by the offender's proximity or activities will\nreceive notification.\nFourth, there is no evidence that the Policy was intended to serve the goal of retribution, and the fact that it might\ndeter probationers from committing sex crimes while on probation is not indicative of punitiveness. As the\nSupreme Court noted in Ursery, ___ U.S. at ___, 116 S.Ct. at 2149, deterrence can serve both regulatory and\npunitive goals. Though making the public aware, through notification, of the offender's potential dangerousness\nmight deter him from re-offending, this is done for the purpose of protecting at-risk populations and of ensuring\nthat the offender does not stray from his rehabilitation. Fifth, as we discussed in Doe v. Pataki, 120 F.3d at 1284,\ncommunity notification is not analogous to either traditional stigmatization penalties or banishment. Modern day\n\ncommunity notification measures serve vastly different purposes than those served by these historical\npunishments, operate without the physical participation of the offender, and lack the general social significance\naccompanying traditional shaming and banishment penalties. In sum, Roe has not provided the \"clearest proof\"\nthat notification pursuant to the Policy constitutes punishment in fact.\nMoreover, one particular feature of the Policy is especially indicative of its nonpunitive character: the requirement,\nfor application to those convicted before January 1, 1995, of an individualized clinical determination of an\noffender's high potential for re-offense. Unlike most community notification schemes in effect around the country,\nincluding the New York version upheld in Doe v. Pataki, the OAP's Policy incorporates the clinical assessment of\na mental health counsellor directly into the determination of whether notification will occur for each potential\nsubject of notification. The decision to notify is not made by a sentencing judge or even by a board of experts\napplying criteria generally relevant to the assessment of likelihood to re-offend. Instead, the critical responsibility\nrests with an expert in the field of sex offender behavior and treatment, who must make a prospective\ndetermination after an individualized examination and assessment of the offender.\nConclusion\nAs we noted in Doe v. Pataki with respect to Judge Chin's decision, we fully understand the conclusion reached\nin this case by Judge Squatrito and have carefully considered his thoughtful opinion. Nevertheless, in light of the\nconstitutional standards as we believe they apply and particularly our recent precedent in Doe v. Pataki, we\nconclude that plaintiff's ex post facto challenge must be rejected. We therefore vacate the District Court's\npreliminary injunction and remand for further consideration, at least of plaintiff's remaining federal claims.\n[*] The Honorable John C. Godbold of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] The New York statute is the Sex Offender Registration Act, N.Y. Correct. Law ยงยง 168-168v (McKinney\nSupp.1997). Statutes of this sort are called \"Megan's Law,\" after Megan Kanka, the seven-year-old victim of a\nsexual assault and murder in New Jersey in 1994, which sparked enactment of sex offender registration and\nnotification statutes in that state and several others.\n[2] \"Sexual assault\" also includes \"any crime committed in any other state or jurisdiction the essential elements of\nwhich are substantially the same as any of the [seven] crimes\" listed in subsection 54-102r(a)(1)(A). Id. ยง 54-102r\n(a)(1)(B).\n[3] A change of address must be reported if it occurs within ten years after the termination of a sentence or term\nof probation. Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยง 54-102r(d).\n[4] Like the registration requirements, the notification provisions also applied to persons convicted of \"any crime\ncommitted in any other state or jurisdiction the essential elements of which are substantially the same as any of\nthe crimes\" defined as \"sexual assault\" by subsection 54-102r(a)(1)(A). Id. ยง 10(a)(1)(B) (codified at Conn.\nGen.Stat. Ann. ยง 54-102r(a)(1)(B)).\n[5] The reference in the Policy's second category to \"similar offenses\" appears to mean not only that the\ntransferees committed the kinds of offenses listed for the first category but also that their convictions occurred\nafter January 1, 1995. We do not decide the coverage of the second category, since it does not apply to the\npetitioner.\n[6] In addition to receiving general information concerning the offender's identity, whereabouts, and background,\nvictims, victims' parents or guardians, and the police will also receive information concerning major status\nchanges in the offender's life, such as a change of address or a change in the term or conditions of probation. \nSee Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. ยง 54-102r(a)(1)(A)-(B).\n[7] Because of his expertise, the OAP had invited Hobson to participate in the drafting of its Policy.\n[8] There is no indication that Cormier has decided to exceed the \"minimum requirements\" of the Policy.\n\n[9] Now that the 1997 Act has eliminated the January 1, 1995, date limitation, section 54-102r will apply to the\nplaintiff as of October 1, 1997, the effective date of the 1997 Act. See 1997 Act ยง 2.\n[10] The Supreme Court stated in Mendoza-Martinez that the following factors are \"all relevant to the inquiry\" of\nwhether a statute is essentially penal or criminal in character: \nWhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a\npunishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the\ntraditional aims of punishment 00 retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a\n97\ncrime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it\nappears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned....\nId. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. at 567-68 (footnotes omitted).\n[11] The Deputy Director testified, \"The adoption of the policies has not changed the authority of probation\nofficers to do this. What it has done is put it into a framework and make it a policy-driven process as opposed to\none that was simply left up to the discretion of the probation officer.\" Transcript of Sept. 29, 1996, hearing at\n94-95.\n[12] The Deputy Director of the OAP expressed a similar thought: \nThe [P]olicy does not rely upon [the 1995 Act]. It does not rely exclusively upon the law. The law, when it was\npassed, ... provided an impetus for us to develop a policy regarding notification.\n....\n[The OAP] believes that [it] ha[s] the authority to provide information to members of the public when we think it is\nappropriate to do so, regarding persons under our supervision, specifically ... when [it] believe[s] [that notification]\nwill enhance public safety.\nDeposition of Michael Santese at 57-58.\n[13] We express no views on the merits of these state law issues, and leave them for future consideration, either\nin the District Court on remand, or, perhaps preferably, in the state courts in the event the District Court declines\nto exercise pendent jurisdiction over plaintiff's state law claims.\n[14] Santese explained that the Policy was promulgated to serve these dual nonpunitive goals: \nThere are several purposes [of the notification] polic[y]. Certainly one of the most important is public safety. It\nenables the recipients to have information that helps to protect them from becoming victims of sexual offenses....\n[I]t also enhances the treatment process.... [Notification] helps to provide additional measures of 00 adds to the\n97\noffender's self-restraints ... by virtue of the fact that knowing that others out there are aware of his circumstances\n... would act as an inhibitor ... on [his desire to] engag[e] in any activities that might place [him] at risk of relapse\nor reoffending.\nTranscript of Hearing, Feb. 29, 1996, at 63 (testimony of Michael Santese). Santese also testified that notification\n\"enhances the [probation] supervision process by providing other resources ... of [] information [regarding the\nprobationer's behavior] for the supervising probation officer.\" Id. at 64.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
