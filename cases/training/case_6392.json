The suit alleged violation of Title VII by Sunmet Agribusiness, Inc for sexual harassment of and retaliation against a female employee. After filing, the EEOC amended its complaint to add Sunmet Agricultural and Old West Farming Co. as defendants. After two status conferences, a settlement conference was held at which the court was notified of settlement. The proposed consent decree was filed on September 7, 2001. It was approved and formally entered on September 10, 2001. </p><p>The consent decree awarded the complainant $45,000. In the decree the defendant agreed to post and distribute information regarding EEOC rights and responsibilities and its commitment to an environment free of sexual harassment. The defendant also agreed to provide a training session for its managers and supervisors. Further, the defendant agreed not to rehire a specific individual and to provide the complainant with a positive reference.</p><p></p>",
