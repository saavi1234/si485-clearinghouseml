The complaint for this case was not available on PACER but it appears from the settlement that defendant Alpha Care Home Health Inc., was accused of violating Title VII by sexual harassing a female. The complainant intervened soon after filing. A trial date was set in February of 1999 for July of that year. In May of 1999, the parties notified the court that they intended to settle the case. On August 11, 1999 a settlement agreement was entered. </p><p>In the settlement agreement the defendant agreed to pay the complainant $15,000. The defendant agreed to distribute and post its anti-discrimination policy and provide training for its employees. The training provision mandated a specific employees attendance at the training session.</p><p></p>",
