Although the complaint is not available, the docket indicates that there were allegations that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating on the basis of sex.  After the defendant filed its initial answer and its certificate of interested parties, the litigants settled and a consent decree was entered in March 2003.  Although the consent decree is not available, the docket states that the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the aggrieved party $30,000, refrain from retaliating and discriminating on the basis of sex, provide its managers with EEO training, and post an EEO notice.  No costs or fees were awarded.</p><p></p>",
