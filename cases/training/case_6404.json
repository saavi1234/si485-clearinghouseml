The \nCommission alleges that Yvette Lafayette, a black woman, was racially discriminated against by \nDefendant. As a result ofthis racial discrimination, Yvette Lafayette was denied a promotion to a \nsales manager position with Defendant. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 451, 1331, 1337, \n1343 and 1345. This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to ยง706(f)(1) and (3) of Title \nVII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. ยง2000e-5(f)(1) and (3) (\"Title VII\") \nand ยง102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. ยง1981a. \n2.  The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were coinmitted within the \n1 \nm \n\"1 111  \"~II  ~ \n11111 \n3:98-cv-00273 1 - 1 \nDATE:  03/26/98  DEPUTY  CLERK:  deep \n\nโข \njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"Commission\"), is \nthe agency ofthe United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and \nenforcement of Title VII, and is expressly authorized to bring this action by ยง706(f)(1) and (3) of \nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง2000e-5(f)(1) and (3). \n4.  At all relevant times, Defendant, Holiday Inn South, MMI (the \"Employer\"), has \ncontinuously been doing business in the State of Louisiana and the City of Baton Rouge, and has \ncontinuously had at least 15 employees. \n5.  At all relevant times, Defendant Employer has continuously been an employer \nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of ยงยง701(b), (g) and (h) of Title \nVII, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง2000e(b)' (g) and (h). \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \n6.  More than thirty days prior to the institution ofthis lawsuit, Yvette Lafayette filed \na charge of discrimination with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant \nEmployer. All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been met. \n7.  Since at least on or about March 3, 1995, Defendant Employer has engaged in \nunlawful employment practices at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana facility in violation of ยง703 of \nTitle VII, 42 U.S.c. ยง2000e-2(a)(1) and (2). Such unlawful employment practices were \ncommitted against Yvette Lafayette. The unlawful practices consisted of Defendant's General \nManager Craig Michelet refusing to promote Yvette Lafayette to the position of sales manager \nbecause she is black, but instead hiring at least two white females who were less qualified, and \n2 \n\nby doing so, engaged in discrimination based on race. \n8.  The effect of the practices complained of in paragraph 7 above has been to \ndeprive Yvette Lafayette of equal employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect her \nstatus as an employee because of her race. \n9.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 7 above were \nintentional. \n10.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 7 above were \ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of Yvette \nLafayette. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Employer, its successors, \nofficers, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in race \ndiscrimination and any other employment practices which discriminates on the basis ofrace. \nB.  Order Defendant Employer to institute and carry out policies, practices, and \nprograms which provide equal employment opportunities for blacks, and which eradicate the \neffects of its past unlawful employment practices. \nC.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole Yvette Lafayette by providing \nappropriate backpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be determined at trial, and other \naffirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of its unlawful employment practices, \nincluding but not limited to frontpay and/or reinstatement, as appropriate. \nD.  Order Defendant Employer to post and keep posted notices in accordance with the \n3 \n\nprovisions of ยง711(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง2000e-l0(a). \nE.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole Yvette Lafayette by providing \ncompensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment \npractices described in paragraph 7 above. \nF.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole Yvette Lafayette by providing \ncompensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practices \ncomplained of in paragraph 7 above, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of \nenjoyment oflife, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial. \nG.  Order Defendant Employer to pay Yvette Lafayette punitive damages for its \nmalicious and reckless conduct described in paragraph 7 above, in amounts to be determined at \ntrial. \nH.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems necessary and proper in the public \ninterest. \n1.
