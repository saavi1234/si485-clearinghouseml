The parties entered into a consent decree on June 22, 2007, which stipulated that the defendant would pay the complainant $35,000 in damages, post a notice of compliance with Title VII, and provide Title VII training to its managers at its Nashville, Tennessee store. The settlement term was one year. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2008.</p>",
