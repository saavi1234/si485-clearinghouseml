The claimant intervened in the EEOC's suit. The case settled by entry of a consent decree in March 2004.  </p><p>The consent decree required the defendant to refrain from discrimination and retaliation; pay the claimant $300,000 in damages; post notice; and provide Title VII training for all of its managers, supervisors, and employees.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "EEOC LITIGATION SETTLEMENT REPORT - MARCH 2004 http://www.eeoc.gov/litigation/settlements/settlement03-04.html\nEEOC v. Parmalat Bakery Div. of North Am.\nNo. 03-4026 (D.N.J. March 31, 2004)\nThe Philadelphia District Office brought this Title VII action, alleging sexual harassment, retaliation and\nconstructive discharge against defendant, a New Jersey division of an international company\nheadquartered in Italy that produces and distributes snacks, bread, pasta and similar products.\nCharging party, a sales division manager and the only woman in an office of four male executives, was\nsubjected to unwelcome sexual advances, sexually explicit comments, the showing of a pornographic\nvideo, and unwelcome touching by her supervisor and other male executives during her employment\nat the New Jersey facility. Her supervisor asked her to attend sales meetings at his apartment, a\ntopless bar, and a swingers club, invitations which she refused, and required her to attend\nwork-related dinners at Hooters and a transvestite karaoke bar where the entertainment included lap\ndances and strip tease contests. While charging party initially did not complain about the harassment\nbecause she believed her supervisor and the human resources manager condoned it, she eventually\ncomplained to her supervisor about a coworker slapping her on the buttocks. In response, her\nsupervisor told her if she reported the incident, he would fire her. CP complained anyway to the vice\npresident of sales and vice president of human resources, and her supervisor instructed her peers to\nostracize her. He also threatened to suspend her, and made derogatory comments about her\nperformance and gave her a low rating. Suffering from post-traumatic stress and depression, CP took\na leave of absence and never returned.\nThe case was resolved by a consent decree that requires defendant to pay a total of $300,000 to\ncharging party. In addition, the decree provides that defendant will not retaliate against individuals\nwho engage in protected activities, and will provide training on sexual harassment and retaliation by\nan EEOC-approved vendor for its managers, supervisors, and employees at the New Jersey facility.\n1 of 1 6/6/2007 12:33 PM",
