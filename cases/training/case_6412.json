This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(f)(1) and (3) of \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3), \nand Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.c. ยง 1981a. \n2. \nVenue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 and Section 706(f)(3) of Title \nVII, 42 U.S.c. ยง 2000e-5(f)(3).  The unlawful actions which are the subject of the instant \nlawsuit occurred within the district of this Court. \nPARTIES \n3. \nPlaintiff,  the  United  States  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (the \n\"Commission\"),  is  the  agency  of  the  United  States  of  America  charged  with  the \nadministration, interpretation and enforcement of Title VII, and is expressly authorized to \n- 2 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \nbring this action by Section 706(f)(1), (2), and (3) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(1), \n(2) and (3). \n4. \nMade Defendants herein are Production Management Industries, L.L.c. (\"PMI\"), a \nLouisiana limited liability company, and Production Management Industries, Inc. (\"PMII\"), \na Louisiana corporation. At all relevant times, PMI and PMII have done business within the \nState of Louisiana and have had at least fifteen (15) employees. \n5. \nOn information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that PMI is the successor entity to PMII, \nand PMI is jointly and severally liable for all actions of PMII which are complained of \nherein.  PMI and PMII are sometimes hereinbelow referred to collectively as \"Defendant.\" \n6. \nAt all relevant times, Defendant has been an employer engaged in an industry \naffecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701(b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 2000e(b), (g) and (h). \n- 3 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \n7. \nAt least as early as April of 1999, Defendant engaged in unlawful employment \npractices at its facility in Harvey, Louisiana, in violation of Section 703 and 704 of Title VII, \n42 U.S.c. ยงยง 2000e-2 and 2000e-3. \n8. \nMore than thirty (30) days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, McGrew filed a \ncharge with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant.  All conditions \nprecedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled. \n9. \nMcGrew is a female who worked for Defendant roughly from July 15, 1998 through \nJune of 1999 as a shipping / receiving clerk. \n10. \nBeginning around July of 1998, and continuing to increasing degrees throughout the \nremainder of her employment with Defendant, McGrew was subjected to sexual harassment \nand a hostile working environment which was severe and pervasive. \n11. \nMcGrew's co-workers made numerous and repeated unwanted and offensive remarks \nto, or knowingly in the presence and earshot of McGrew. \n- 4 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \n12. \nThe offensive sexual remarks to which McGrew was subjected occurred on a regular \nand consistent basis. \n13. \nDefendant officials with managerial and/or supervisory authority, who were \"agents\" \nof Defendant within the meaning of Title Vll, were aware, or should have been aware, of \nthe sexual harassment to which McGrew was being subjected, but failed to take prompt, \neffective, appropriate remedial measures in response. \n14. \nDefendant did not have an effective system in place during McGrew's employment \nto prevent its employees from being subjected to sexual harassment. \n15. \nOne of Defendant's foremen admitted that he heard many of the above-referenced \nkinds of conduct on a routine basis but did not take effective action to end it. \n16. \nOne of McGrew's co-workers admitted that he himself often asked her if she wanted \nto see his penis, that he gave her a Playgirl magazine for her birthday, that he literally ripped \nhis shirt off in her office and later tacked it to her wall with a note falsely stating that \nMcGrew had ripped it off of him, that he often looked at pornographic magazines with other \n- 5 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \nco-workers, making such comments as those quoted above, and that he pulled his pants \ndown on his final day of work to expose his penis to the office workers. \n17. \nAround the middle of June of 1999, on two occasions McGrew found a total of four \nunpack aged condoms in various places in her workstation, including her sweater pocket. \nMcGrew  then  made  a  formal  complaint,  in  addition  to  past  notice  to  Defendant's \nmanagement by virtue of the fact that much of the conduct described above had occurred in \nfront of management employees. \n18. \nMcGrew asked a co-worker to take a Polaroid photograph of the two condoms which \nshe found on her desk on June 14, 1999, which he did.  At least one of these two condoms \nwas contaminated by a wet substance that appeared to be bodily fluid of some kind which \nleft a residue on the paper to which the condom was stuck.  The photographs show such \nresidue.  Mrs. McGrew was greatly disturbed at finding condoms on her desk which may \nhave had bodily fluids on them. \n19. \nMcGrew reported and complained about finding the condoms on June 14, 1999, and \nJune 21, 1999. Respondent discharged McGrew three days later on June 24, 1999, allegedly \ndue to a lack of work.  However, prior to having hand surgery on June 9, 1999, McGrew \n- 6 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \nspoke with her immediate supervisor about her situation, specifically asking if there was any \nchance of being laid off.  McGrew was informed that she would not be laid off.  A sworn \naffidavit from the foreman, Randy Tassin, states that he overheard McGrew's immediate \nsupervisor tell her that she would not be laid off. \n20. \nMcGrew was subjected to sexual harassment by Defendant so as (a) to materially alter \nthe terms and conditions of her employment, and/or (b) to impede her ability to perform her \njob. \n21. \nDefendant discharged McGrew in retaliation for complaining of sexual harassment \nand/or for otherwise engaging in activity protected under Title VII, thereby further violating \nthe statute. \n22. \nDefendant either knew or should have known of the illegal actions of the individuals \nwho harassed McGrew. \n23. \nDefendant did not take appropriate reasonable steps to prevent McGrew from being \nsubjected to illegal harassment. \n- 7 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \n24. \nThe unlawful practices of Defendant complained of herein have deprived McGrew, \nand any individuals in like or related situations, of equal employment opportunities and have \notherwise  adversely  affected  the  conditions of their employment,  and their status  as \nemployees, because of their sex (female). \n25. \nThe unlawful employment practices complained of herein were intentional. \n26. \nThe unlawful employment practices complained of herein caused McGrew, and any \nother similarly situated female employees, to suffer economic injuries, including but not \nlimited to lost wages, as well as nonpecuniary injuries. \n27. \nDefendant engaged in the unlawful employment practices complained of herein with \nmalice and/or with reckless indifference to McGrew's federally protected rights and those \nof persons in like or related circumstances. \n- 8 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \nPRAY  ER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, its officers, successors, \nassigns,  and  all  persons  in  active  concert or participation  with  it,  from \nengaging in harassment against employees because of their sex and from \nengaging in any other employment practice which discriminates on the basis \nof sex or which effectuates retaliation against any person for having engaged \nin activity protected by Title VII; \nB.  Order Defendant to institute and carry out policies, practices, and programs \nwhich provide equal employment opportunities for female persons, and which \neradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful employment practices, \nincluding but not limited to an effective anti-harassment policy; \nC.  Order Defendant to make whole McGrew, and any individuals in like or \nrelated situations, by reinstating them to their former positions without the loss \nof seniority or any benefit of employment, and/or by providing compensation \nfor past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment \npractices described above, including but not limited to lost wages, in amounts \nto be determined in the course of the proceedings; \nD.  Order Defendant to make whole McGrew, and any individuals in like or \nrelated  situations,  by  providing  compensation  for  past  and  future \nnonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practices complained of \nherein, including but not limited to emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, \nloss of enjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined in the \ncourse of the proceedings; \nE.  Order Defendant to pay punitive damages for  its  malicious and reckless \nconduct described above, in amounts to be determined at trial; \nF.  Award the Commission its costs of this action; and \n, G.  Grant any and all other relief, legal or equitable, which the Court deems \nnecessary and proper in the public interest. \n- 9 -\n\nโข  โข  โข \nJURY TRIAL DEMAND \nIn accordance with Rules 38 and 39 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nCommission hereby requests a jury on all issues raised in the instant Complaint which may \nbe tried by jury. \nRespectfully submitted, \nGWENDOLYN YOUNG REAMS \nAssociate General Counsel \nNo Bar Roll Number Assigned \nKEITH T.
