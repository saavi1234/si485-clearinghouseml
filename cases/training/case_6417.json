The complaint, filed in January 2001, alleged race discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically that Defendant subjected the charging party to a racially hostile work environment and then retaliated against her when she complained about the harassment.  In November 2001, Defendant moved for summary judgment and the motion was granted in part in February 2002 (EEOC's claim for retaliation was dismissed at this time).  In February 2002 the parties engaged in a settlement conference and the case settled. In April 2002 a consent decree was entered.  The decree, valid for five years, required Defendant to pay the charging party $15,000, expunge her employment records and provide her with a neutral employment reference.  Defendant was enjoined from discrimination or retaliating in violation of Title VII and required to provide employment discrimination training to its employees, post a notice of non-discrimination at its work place, and adopt and disseminate an anti-discrimination policy.The decree was entered in 2002 and scheduled to last 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.",

We nonetheless agreed to hear the Motion under the \ncircumstances of this case.  Although the Court did not adopt the suggestion, the Parties \nhad agreed to an extension of time.  There was no express agreement to extend the time \n2 \n\nCase 0:01-cv-00143-RHK-JMM     Document 38     Filed 12/21/2001     Page 3 of 7(cid:10)\nfor the making of the Motion, but Defendant reasonably concluded that the making of the \nMotion should be deferred until efforts at resolving discovery disputes could be resolved. \nInterrogatory Nos. 17. 18 and 19 \nThe text of Interrogatory Nos. 17, 18 and 19, as well as Plaintiff's responses, \nare as follows: \n\"Interrogatory No.  17: Has Plaintiff undertaken, or required, \nany counseling, treatment,  medical or other health care or \ntaken  any prescription  medication for any circumstance or \ncondition that has caused her emotional pain, suffering, loss of \nenjoyment  of  life  and/or  humiliation  during  the  past  (10) \ncalender years?  If so, please identify the circumstances or \ncondition requiring medical care or treatment by a health care \nprovider, the nature of the treatment provided, the name and \nidentity of the health care provider that offered this treatment, \ncounseling, prescription medication or therapy and what type \nof therapy or treatment was provided to [Plaintiff]. \n\"Interrogatory No. 18: Does Plaintiff contend that the allegedly \nwrongful conduct of the Defendant aggravated, exacerbated or \nmade worse any pre-existing medical condition, or any pre \nexisting emotional pain,  suffering,  loss of enjoyment of life \nand/or humiliation caused by any circumstance or condition in \nthe Plaintiff's life? If [Plaintiff] makes this claim, please state \nwithin specificity the pre-existing condition or circumstances \nthat was  exacerbated,  aggravated  or made worse  by  the \nalleged conduct of the Defendant herein. \n\"Interrogatory No. 19: Does Plaintiff acknowledge the existence \nof any circumstances or conditions in her life outside of her \nwork with Defendant (sic) and inducing her in any need for \ntherapy, counseling, treatment, medical care or health care, or \nrequiring  any  medication  by  reason  of  emotional  pain, \nsuffering,  loss of enjoyment of life,  and/or humiliation?  If \n[Plaintiff]  acknowledges  other  circumstances  causing \nthese types of stresses,  please state with  specificity the \nnature of those circumstances and the nature of the health \ncare help or assistance that [Plaintiff] has sought for those \nconditions.\" \nIt  is  obvious  from  these  questions that  Plaintiff was  required  to  provide  a  narrative \n3 \n\nCase 0:01-cv-00143-RHK-JMM     Document 38     Filed 12/21/2001     Page 4 of 7(cid:10)\nresponse only if Plaintiff answered the initial question posed by the interrogatory in the \naffi rmative. \nThe Interrogatories were served on April 6, 2001.  Plaintiff's initial response \nwas served on May 3,2001. It served Supplemental Responses on June 5 and August 15, \n2001.  In each of these responses, Plaintiff did not provide a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to the \ninitial question, but it objected to providing the narrative response. Defendant reasonably \nconcluded that Plaintiff intended to answer \"yes\" to the initial questions, and thus was \nunder an obligation to answer the narrative portion of the question. After all, if the answer \nto the initial questions were \"no,\" there would be no obligation to provide a narrative \nresponse, and thus no reason to object.  Defendant thus brought a Motion to Compel. \nAfter reviewing the pleadings of the Parties, and following statements by \ncounsel for Plaintiff at oral argument, this Court concluded that Plaintiff should be required \nto provide \"yes\" or \"no\" responses to the questions.  It has now done so.  Its responses \nwere \"no\" to each of these Interrogatories.  We are at a loss to understand why Plaintiff \nfailed to answer \"no\" on any of the three earlier occasions on which it responded to the \nInterrogatories.  As a result of Plaintiff's improper failure to perform this simple task, the \nDefendant has been unnecessarily burdened with expenses and attorney's fees which \notherwise would have been wholly unnecessary. \nInterrogatory No. 16 \nInterrogatory No. 16 reads as follows: \n\"Do  you  make  claim  that April  Landers  has  required  any \nmedical or health care attention, any medical or health care \ntreatment, counseling, therapy medication or consultation by \nreason Of the conduct of the Defendant as alleged in your \nComplaint?  If you make this claim, please set forth each and \n4 \n\nCase 0:01-cv-00143-RHK-JMM     Document 38     Filed 12/21/2001     Page 5 of 7(cid:10)\nevery  health  care  provider with  whom  April  Landers  has \ntreated  or who  has provided  consultation  care,  therapy or \nprescription medication to Ms.  Landers.  For each health care \nprovider that you identify, set forth the name of that health care \nprovider, where that entity is located, the address of that entity \nand the nature of health care services provided to Landers by \nthat entity.\" \nAs with Interrogatory Nos. 17,28 and 19, Plaintiff failed to provide a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer \nto the initial question. After Court Orders, Plaintiff ultimately answered the first part of this \nInterrogatory as follows: \n\"No, EEOC does not make the claim that April Landers has \nrequired any medical or health care attention, any medical or \nhealth care treatment, therapy, medication or consultation by \nreason of the conduct of the Defendant. \n\"Yes, EEOC makes the claim that April Landers has required \ncounseling by reason of the conduct of the Defendant.\" \nPlaintiff relies  upon the language of the Court in  O'Sullivan v.  State of \nMinnesota, 176 F.R.O. 325, 327 (D. Minn. 1997) as follows: \n\"In Schlagenhauf v.  Holder. 379 U.S. 104, 118-19,85 S. Ct. \n234,242-43, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964), the Court concluded that \nthe 'in  controversy,'  and  the 'good  cause'  requirements of \nRule 35, were not satisfied 'by mere conclusory allegations of \nthe pleadings--nor by mere relevance to the case--but require \nan affirmative showing by the movant that each condition as to \nwhich the examination  is sought is  really and  genuinely in \ncontroversy and  that good  cause exists for ordering  each \nexamination.  Here,  the  Complaint's  bare  and  boilerplate \nallegations  of  'mental  anguish,'  'emotional  distress,'  and \n'embarrassment and humiliation,' provide a legally insufficient \nbasis for concluding that the  Plaintiff's  mental  condition  is \n'genuinely  in  controversy,'  or that  'good  cause  exists  for \nordering [the] examination.'\" \nWe are satisfied that Defendant has shown that Plaintiff has a claim for \nemotional distress that is more than a \"bare and boilerplate allegations of mental anguish, \nemotional distress and embarrassment and humiliation\" that were deemed insufficient in \n5 \n\nCase 0:01-cv-00143-RHK-JMM     Document 38     Filed 12/21/2001     Page 6 of 7(cid:10)\nO'Sullivan, 176 F.R.D. at 327.  Now that we have a direct Answer to Interrogatory No. 16. \nit is made apparent that April Landers' medical condition is placed in controversy not \nmerely by the allegations in the Complaint, but by the Answers to Interrogatories. \nIt seems to be the position of Plaintiff that, for purposes of determining \nwhether the mental condition of April Landers is placed in controversy for the purposes of \nRule 35 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the answer should be \"no,\"  but for \npurposes of having the jury determine that she suffered (mental) emotional distress, the \nanswer should be \"yes.\"  Plaintiff cannot have it both ways.  Plaintiff desires to present \ntestimony that the mental condition of April  Landers was affected  by the conduct of \nDefendant, by reason of the fact that she \"has required counseling by reason of the \nconduct of the Defendant.\"  Defendant is entitled to  have the limited discovery here \nordered to analyze whether the facts support or do not support this view. \nDocument Request Nos. 1 and 2 \nThese Requests read as follows: \n\"1.  Full  certified  copies  of all  medical  records  from  all \nmedical providers who have provided treatment or consultation \nto April Landers within the last five years. \n\"2.  Copies of all 'explanation of  forms or similar \nhenf~fits' \ndocuments provided to April Landers by any and all medical \ninsurance providers which contain information relating to any \nmedical insurance claims submitted by, or on behalf of, April \nLanders to said insurance provider relating to any treatments \nand/or consultations received by April Landers within the last \nfive years.\" \nThe failure of Plaintiff to provide a direct response to  Interrogatory No. 16 \nuntil after the Motion to Compel was briefed and argued has unnecessarily complicated the \nconsideration  of the Motion  as  it relates to  these  Requests  well,  and  has  made \ni:::I:S \nDefendant's burden  of establishing  a right to  obtain the  requested  information more \n6 \n\nCase 0:01-cv-00143-RHK-JMM     Document 38     Filed 12/21/2001     Page 7 of 7(cid:10)\ndifficult.  It would be inappropriate to permit Plaintiff to profit from its improper responses \nto Interrogatory No. 16. We nonetheless have undertaken to make substantial reductions \nin the amount of data required to be produced in  response to this discovery, to take \naccount of the fact that Plaintiff has committed that at trial  it will  not present expert \ntestimony  from  any  medical  provider,  and  will  only  offer the  testimony  of Carollyn \nHartsfield, (a person described as a \"therapist\") to establish a sequence of events starting \nwith the alleged misconduct of Defendant, and the resulting decision of the April Landers \nto visit Ms.  Hartsfield.1  We have balanced understandable concern for the privacy of \nMs. Landers with the fact that she is a party to litigation in which fairness requires that both \nparties have access to data relevant to claims which are to be presented to the jury. \nSanctions \nPlaintiff's nondisclosures and objections were not substantially justified, and \nthere are no circumstances which make an award of expenses unjust.  The conduct of \nPlaintiff  requires  that  the  Court  impose  sanctions  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of \nRule 37 (a)( 4 )(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Order describes the process \nby which the amount of the sanction will be determined. As a convenience to the Parties, \nthe hearing is scheduled to coincide with the hearing on the Court's Order to Show Cause, \nand a Settlement Conference, also scheduled for January 14, 2002.  If any Party desires \nthat the Settlement Conference or any of the hearings be  rescheduled,  this  may be \naccomplished by simply calling the Calendar Clerk of this Court. \nJ.M.M. \nWe also make no finding as to whether such testimony, if offered, will be admissible at trial. \n7 ",

Minnesota. \nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, Plaintiff, \nv. \nQUALITY PORK PROCESSORS, INC., Defendant. \nNo. Civ.01โ143(RHK/JMM). | Feb. 1, 2002. \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nTina  Burnside,  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission,  Minneapolis,  Minnesota,  and  Rosemary  J.  Fox,  Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for Plaintiff. \nJohn S. Beckmann, Hoversten, Johnson, Beckmann & Hovey, Austin, Minnesota, for Defendant. \nOpinion \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nKYLE, J. \n \nIntroduction \n*1 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (โEEOCโ) brought this action on behalf of a white female, April \nLanders, who was employed at Quality Pork Processors, Inc.โs (โQPPโ) slaughterhouse in Austin, Minnesota. Landers claims \nshe was subjected to a racially hostile work environment at QPP by reason of racially derogatory remarks made to her by \ncertain co-workers regarding the AfricanโAmerican man she was dating. Landers also claims that QPP retaliated against her \nfor reporting the racial harassment, and for complaining that her immediate supervisor had not addressed those complaints. \nThe alleged retaliation took the form of transferring Landers to another position at the facility. \n  \nPresently before the Court is QPPโs Motion for Summary Judgment. QPP argues that the EEOC cannot establish at least one \nessential element of each of the claims asserted against itโthe hostile work environment claim and the retaliation claim. For \nthe reasons set forth below, QPPโs motion will be granted in part and denied in part. \n  \n \nBackground1 \nOn December 21, 1998, QPP hired Landers to work at its slaughterhouse facility in Austin, Minnesota. Landers applied \ntogether with her boyfriend, Bill Matlock. (Dep. of April Landers, vol. 1, at 62โ63 (Dec. 13, 2001 Beckman Aff., Ex. A).) \nMatlock is AfricanโAmerican. (See id.) Landers and Matlock were hired to work on the same shift, the second shift.2 (Id. at \n66.) Landers was ultimately assigned to the skinning room, where she worked with thirty to thirty-five other workers. (Id. at \n70; Wicks Aff. ยถ 3.) During the period in which the alleged incidents of racial harassment occurred, Landersโ immediate \nsupervisor was Roger Hansen. \n  \nSometime in January of 1999, two of Landersโ co-workers, Steve Guitierrez and Tha Im, began making racially derogatory \nremarks to Landers regarding Matlock. (Landers Dep, vol. 1, at 384โ89 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 13).) Guitierrez called Landers a \nโnigger loverโ and would ask Landers questions like โhow is your nigger doing?โ (Dep. of Tha Im at 16 (Burnside Decl. Ex. \n11); Landers Dep., vol. 1, at 376โ379.) Guitierrez would make such comments to Landers every day that he worked with \n  1 \n \n\nE.E.O.C. v, Quality Pork Processors, Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n \nLanders in the skinning room. (Landers Dep., vol. 1, at 385.) If Guitierrez was working in the skinning room with Landers, \nhe would make such a statement to her between one and three times a day during their shift. (Id.) Landers would respond by \ntelling Guitierrez not to use the โnโโ word because she did not like it. (Landers Dep., vol. 1, at 379โ84; id., vol. 2, at 4.) Im \nwould also make the same racially derogatory statement regarding Landersโ boyfriend.3 (Id., vol. 2, at 6โ7.) This behavior \ncontinued through early May. (Id., vol. 1, at 127โ28, 384โ85.) Landers would feel hurt by the remarks and sometimes would \ngo to the restroom during her breaks to cry. (Landers Dep., vol 2, at 11โ12.) \n  \nDuring the last week of April 1999, Landers complained about the racial slurs to her supervisor, Hansen.4 (Id. at 12, 18.) He \ndid nothing to investigate the situation, responding to Landersโ complaint by saying that Guitierrez and Im were โjust boys.โ \n(Id . at 18โ20.) One evening during the first week in May, Landers did not report to work for her regular shift after having \nworked overtime the evening before. (Id. at 29; see also Hansen Dep. at 16.) The following day, Hansen reprimanded her for \nbeing absent and told her that she could no longer work overtime because she had failed to report to work for her regularly \nscheduled shift. (Landers Dep., vol. 2, at 32.) According to Landers, Hansen was rude and yelled at her about the issue in \nfront of other employees. (Def.โs Answers to Interrogatories at 1โ2 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 6); Landers Dep., vol. 2, at 29.) \n  \n*2 On May 6, 1999, Landers met with Dale Wicks, QPPโs Director of Human Resources, to complain about the companyโs \nattendance policy and the directive she had received from Hansen that prohibited her from working additional overtime.5 \n(Landers Dep., vol. 2, at 78; Dep. of Dale Wicks at 15โ16 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 15).) At this meeting, Landers also told Wicks \nthat two co-workers had been calling her boyfriend a โnigger.โ (Landers Dep., vol. 2, at 25โ26, 78.) Landers told Wicks that \nโTony and Steveโ in the skinning room had been making the racially offensive remarks to her.6 (Id. at 27โ28.) She also \ncomplained that Hansen had done nothing about the problem when she had brought it to his attention. (Id. at 26 .) \n  \nOn May 7, 1999, the general foreman for the โnight shift kill,โ Ricky Faith, approached Landers at her work station and told \nher that he would like to speak with her in his office. (Id. at 53.) Also at that meeting was the night superintendent, Jim \nHoffman. (Id.) Landers spoke with them about the racial slurs that had been made to her by her co-workers and the directive \nfrom Hansen that she could no longer work overtime because she had been absent from her regularly scheduled shift. (Id. at \n53โ54.) Faith and Hoffman apologized for how Hansen had handled the overtime situation and told Landers that Hansen \nshould not have denied her overtime. (Id. at 54.) When Landers returned to her work area, Hansen yelled at her because \nneither she nor anyone else had told him why she had left the skinning room. (Id. at 55.) \n  \nThree  days  later,  QPP  management  transferred  Landers  to  a  position  QPP  had  created  earlier  in  the  month:  fecal \ncontamination inspector.7 Faith conferred with Hansen and determined that Landers had the requisite skills to perform the \nfecal contamination inspector position on the night shift. (Def.โs Answers to Interrogs. at 9โ11 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 6).) On \nMay 10, Faith told Landers to grab her things because she was moving to a different position where they needed someone \nwith good eyesight who spoke English. (Landers Dep., vol. 2, at 81โ82.) Landers was moved to the end of the kill line and \nwas given a bucket of water and a knife and told to scrape off any feces from the anus of the hog. (Id. at 90, 92.) When \nLanders asked Faith if she was being moved because of her complaints, he did not respond. (Id. at 83.) \n  \nAfter May 10, Landers complained about her transfer to the night union steward, who referred her to another union steward \nnamed Emil โButchโ Laack, Jr. Landers told Laack she had been having problems with Hansen, including the fact that, when \nshe told Hansen about the racial comments made to her in the skinning room, Hansen had done nothing. Landers also told \nLaack that she had talked to Faith about her problem with Hansen and the racially derogatory remarks, following which Faith \nhad moved her to a different job.8 \n  \nOn May 26, 1999, Landers and Laack met with Wicks for about one-and-a-half hours. (Def.โs Answers to Interrogs. at 2; \nLanders Dep, vol. 2, at 122โ23.) As part of this discussion, Landers said that Hansen had failed to address her complaint of \nracial harassment relating back to remarks about her boyfriend.9 (Landers Dep. vol. 2, at 122โ23.) Landers also complained \nthat she had been transferred to the fecal contamination inspector position in retaliation for her complaints about Hansen. (Id. \nat 131.) \n  \n*3 On June 29, 1999, Landers bid for re-assignment to an open position in the livestock pens.10 Landers transferred to that \nposition on August 16, 1999. \n  \nPrior to Landersโ transfer to the livestock pens, she filed EEOC complaints against both QPP and the Union. On August 29, \n1999, Landers (together with an EEOC representative) participated in a mediated settlement conference with the Union \nrelating to her charge. She identified to the Union the two co-workers who had made the racially offensive comments to her. \nThe union representatives determined that the co-workers should be disciplined and made to apologize to Landers. (Dep. of \nDennis LeBarron at 22โ24, 28 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 14).) Within a week, Wicks met with both Im and Guitierrez, who \n  2 \n \n\nE.E.O.C. v, Quality Pork Processors, Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n \nadmitted their wrongdoing. Both men apologized to Landers personally, and Wicks placed a warning slip in both mensโ files. \n(See LeBarron Dep. at 25โ27; Warning Slips (Burnside Decl. Ex. 2.).) On July 13, 2001, Landers quit her job at QPP. \n  \n \nAnalysis \nI. Standard of Decision \nSummary judgment is proper if, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party \nbears the burden of showing that the material facts in the case are undisputed. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 \n(1986); Mems v. City of St. Paul. Depโt of Fire & Safety Servs., 224 F.3d 735, 738 (8th Cir.2000). The court must view the \nevidence, and the inferences which may be reasonably drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See \nGraves v. Arkansas Depโt of Fin. & Admin., 229 F.3d 721, 723 (8th Cir.2000); Calvit v. Minneapolis Pub. Schs., 122 F.3d \n1112, 1116 (8th Cir.1997). \n  \nThe nonmoving party may not rest on mere allegations or denials, but rather must demonstrate the existence of specific facts \nthat create a genuine issue for trial. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986); Krenik v. County of Le \nSueur, 47 F.3d 953, 957 (8th Cir.1995). The court does not weigh facts or evaluate the credibility of affidavits and other \nevidence on a motion for summary judgment. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249. The nonmovant, however, cannot avoid \nsummary judgment in favor of the movant merely by pointing to some alleged factual dispute between the parties. Instead, \nany fact alleged to be in dispute must be โoutcome determinative under prevailing law,โ that is, it must be material to an \nessential element of the specific theory of recovery at issue. See Dancy v. Hyster Co., 127 F.3d 649, 652 (8th Cir.1997); Get \nAway Club, Inc. v. Coleman, 969 F.2d 664, 666 (8th Cir.1992). \n  \nIf a party cannot support an essential element of its claim or defense, summary judgment must be granted as to that claim or \ndefense, for a complete failure of proof regarding an essential element necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. See \nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 322โ23. The EEOC has asserted two claims against QPP under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: \na claim for hostile-work-environment racial harassment arising from the conduct of employees Guitierrez and Im, and a claim \nfor retaliation arising from Landersโ transfer to the fecal contamination inspection position. QPP argues that the EEOC \ncannot establish at least one essential element of each claim. The Court begins with the hostile work environment claim. \n  \n \nII. HostileโWorkโEnvironment Racial Harassment \n*4 Title VII provides that it is โan unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual \nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individualโs race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000eโ2(a)(1). โThe phrase โterms, conditions, or privileges of employmentโ \nevinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment, \nwhich includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.โ Harris v. Forklift Systems, \nInc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). โWhen the workplace is permeated with โdiscriminatory \nintimidation, ridicule, and insult,โ that is โsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victimโs employment \nand create an abusive working environment,โ Title VII is violated.โ Id. (quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 \nU.S. 57, 65, 67 (1986)) (internal citations omitted). \n  \nTo prevail on its claim that Landers was discriminated against based upon a racially hostile work environment, the EEOC \nmust show that (1) Landers is a member of a protected group, (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment, (3) the \nharassment was based upon race, (4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment, and (5) QPP \nknew or should have known of the racially discriminatory harassment and failed to take prompt and effective measures to end \nit. Willis v. Henderson, 262 F.3d 801, 808 (8th Cir.2001). The fourth essential element of the racially hostile work \nenvironment claim has both a subjective and an objective component. Id. at 808โ09. Thus, the EEOC must show not only that \nLanders was subjectively affected by the racially discriminatory behavior but also that the conduct complained of was \nsufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively hostile environment that altered the terms, conditions, or privileges of \nher employment. \n  \nQPPโs summary judgment motion focuses on the fourth element in Willis.11 QPP does not challenge whether, subjectively, \n  3 \n \n\nE.E.O.C. v, Quality Pork Processors, Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n \nLanders was affected by the offensive conduct. Evidence in the record shows that the offensive statements about her \nboyfriend sometimes caused her to go to the bathroom and cry during her breaks and negatively impacted her desire to go to \nwork. QPP argues that the EEOCโs claim of hostile environment race discrimination fails because the statements of Landersโ \nco-workers (although admittedly offensive) were neither sufficiently severe nor sufficiently pervasive to create an objectively \nhostile work environment.12 \n  \nโEvidence  of  a  hostile  environment  must  not  be  compartmentalized,  but  must  instead  be  based  on  the  totality  of \ncircumstances of the entire hostile work environment.โ Delph v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co., 130 F.3d 349, 355 (8th Cir.1997) \n(quoting Gillming v. Simmons Indus., 91 F.3d 1168, 1172 (8th Cir.1996)). To determine whether there is sufficient evidence \nfrom which a jury could find an objectively hostile or abusive work environment, the district court must consider all of the \ncircumstances, including the presence or absence of other people, โthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; \nwhether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with \nan employeeโs work performance.โ Harris, 510 U.S. at 23; Carter v. Chrysler Corp., 173 F.3d 693, 702 (8th Cir.1999). \n  \n*5 Landers does not claim that her co-workersโ conduct through early May 1999 was physically threatening or humiliating. \nLanders missed no work as a result of her co-workersโ behavior. (Wicks Aff. ยถ 10; Landers Dep., vol. 1, at 257 (Dec. 13, \n2001 Beckmann Aff. Ex. A).) Nor is there evidence tending to show that Landersโ job performance changed as a result of the \noffensive comments. (See Wicks Aff. ยถ 10; Landers Dep., vol. 1, at 258.) She was not reprimanded for doing her job poorly \nduring the time period in which her two co-workers were making the racially derogatory remarks. (Landers Dep ., vol. 2, at \n12.) Landers also testified that she was unaware of any other racially discriminatory or racially hostile behavior at the plant, \nother than the two co-workersโ actions toward her. (Landers Dep., vol. 1, at 171, 186โ87, 195, 198 (Dec. 13, 2001 Beckmann \nAff. Ex. A).) \n  \nViewing the record in the light most favorable to the EEOC, the alleged harassment consisted of two co-workers making \nracially offensive comments to Landers on an almost daily basis for a period of approximately four months. The comments \nconsisted  almost  exclusively  of  the  question  โHow  is  your  nigger  doing?โโmade  in  reference  to  Landersโ  black \nboyfriendโand was sometimes repeated up to three times per shift. Landers would tell the men not to use the offensive word \nin referencing her boyfriend, and they would respond by laughing at her. Landers also claims that Guitierrez would ask the \noffensive question more loudly when other workers were present; those workers would hear the remark and laugh. (Landers \nDep ., vol. 1, at 388.) \n  \nFrom this evidence, the EEOC argues that this case is similar to Carter v. Chrysler Corp., in which a black woman was \nregularly subjected to verbal abuse, including sexual and racial epithets, over the course of two years. The facts in Carter, \nhowever, present a much more egregious picture than the facts presented on the record here, even viewing the evidence in the \nlight most favorable to Landers. In Carter, the plaintiff was subjected not only to verbal abuse but also to rude sexual \ngestures, โsexual insults were written on the walls of the company restroom, and acts of vandalism occurred in her work area. \nA picture of a naked man, dead animals, threatening notes, foul-smelling material, and debris were directed at her area.โ \nCarter, 262 F.3d at 702. The offensive conduct in this case is limited strictly to verbal statements by two co-employees. \n  \nThe EEOC argues that the constant use of racial epithets toward a plaintiff is sufficient to establish the existence of a racially \nhostile workplace. In Ross v. Douglas County, Neb., 234 F.3d 391, 397 (8th Cir.2000), the court of appeals affirmed a jury \nverdict finding liability for hostile work environment racial discrimination. The evidence in Ross established that, for over a \nyear, the plaintiffโs supervisor at the county correctional facility, a black man, refused to address Ross, also black, as โOfficer \nRossโ and instead constantly addressed him as โniggerโ or โblack boy.โ13 234 F.3d at 393. Even though Ross protested that \nconduct and ultimately filed a grievance, the abusive language did not stop. The supervisor continued to address him using \nracial slurs until Ross resigned six months later. Id. In Delph v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co., the court of appeals affirmed the \ntrial courtโs determination, after a bench trial, that the defendant had constructively discharged the plaintiff by subjecting him \nto a racially hostile workplace environment. 130 F.3d at 356โ57. Delph, the only black employee at the bottling plant, was \nrepeatedly addressed by his supervisor as โnigger,โ โblack boy,โ โtoken black boy,โ and โmy little black boy.โ Id. at 352. \nFurthermore, Delphโs co-workers used racial slurs and told racial jokes at the plant in the presence of the supervisors, who \nsaid nothing.14 Id. This evidence was sufficient to support the trial courtโs determinations. \n  \n*6 Comparing the facts of this case with the facts described above from Delph and Ross, several differences present \nthemselves. The racial epithets in this case were not spoken by a supervisor, but rather by two employees out of a workforce \non the second shift of over 100. The duration of the unwelcome conduct here can be measured in months, not years. No racial \njokes or other racial comments were made in Landersโ presence. Even considering these distinctions, however, the Court \ncannot conclude as a matter of law that no reasonable jury could find that the behavior of Landersโ co-employees was merely \nan isolated instance or two of using insulting language. While the racially derogatory term may not have been used in \n  4 \n \n\nE.E.O.C. v, Quality Pork Processors, Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n \nreference to Landers, the language was intentionally directed at her. Furthermore, the racist epithet used in this case is \nirredeemably offensive and cannot be characterized, as a matter of law, as being either harmless or casual. See Delph, 130 F \n.3d at 356โ57. \n  \nBased on the record before it, there appears to be sufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find that the \nconduct complained of was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment. \nTherefore, summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim will be denied. \n  \n \nIII. Reprisal Claim \nTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of Title VII, the EEOC must show that Landers engaged in protected \nactivity under Title VII, she suffered an adverse employment action, and a causal connection exists between the protected \nactivity and the adverse employment action. Sowell v. Alumina Ceramics, Inc., 251 F.3d 678, 684 (8th Cir.2001). The \nadverse employment action in question is Landersโ transfer to the job of fecal contamination inspector. \n  \nQPP argues that Landersโ transfer was not an adverse job action. โA transfer involving only minor changes in working \nconditions and no reduction in pay or benefits will not constitute an adverse employment action.โ Ledergerber v. Stangler, \n122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir.1997). Neither Landersโ hours nor her salary were diminished as a result of the transfer, nor \nwas there any impact on her benefits or leave. (Landers Dep., vol. 2, at 97โ100, 119.) The environment in which her new job \nwas performed was essentially the same (in terms of ventilation, heat, and lighting) as the environment in the skinning room. \n(Wicks Aff. ยถ 8.) Furthermore, QPP contendsโand Landers does not disputeโthat the fecal contamination inspector position \nwas less physically demanding than Landersโ previous job in the skinning room because she was only required to work on \napproximately one in eighty hogs in her new position, compared with shaving hair off of the snouts of every hog passing \nthrough the skinning room. \n  \nLanders complains that, as a fecal contamination inspector, she had to secure a replacement before taking a break because she \nwas responsible for examining each carcass on the line for contaminants; other employees on the kill line did not need to \nobtain a replacement. (Amended EEOC Charge No. 265990895 at Bates No. 60 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 4); Landers Dep., vol. 2, \nat 110.) There is no evidence suggesting that Landers was denied breaks or unable to take breaks because she could not \nsecure a replacement. Indeed, Landers acknowledged in her deposition that the transfer to fecal contamination inspector did \nnot change the number or length of her breaks, only their timing relative to when they had occurred in the skinning room. (Id. \nat 99.) A reassignment constitutes an โadverse employment actionโ where the changes in duties and working conditions cause \nthe plaintiff a โmaterially significant disadvantage.โ See Harlston v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 37 F.3d 379, 382 (8th \nCir.1994). Needing to secure a replacement to go on break does not rise to that level of disadvantage.15 \n  \n*7 Landersโ also argues that, as a fecal contamination inspector, her work responsibilities were diminished. Landers contends \nthat at least thirty-two other employees had โinspectedโ the carcass before it reached Landersโ post. That assertion does not \naccurately characterize the role of the preceding employees on the kill line. Those โupstreamโ employees worked on the \ncarcass by removing intestines and other internal organs. (See April 7, 2000 response letter to EEOC (Burnside Decl. Ex. 7); \nWicks Aff. ยถ 9.) There is no evidence to support a finding that each employee on the kill line who had handled the carcass \nprior to Landers had โinspectedโ it before it moved on to the next operator. \n  \nLanders also contends that other acts aside from the transfer were โretaliatoryโ: her paycheck was temporarily misplaced on \ntwo occasions (Landers Dep., vol. 2, at 133โ36, 142โ43); a coworker shocked her with an electric prod (id. at 145โ49); her \nlaundry bag developed tears in it, causing some of her work clothes to disappear (id. at 152โ58); and someone flattened a tire \non her car while it was parked on the QPP parking lot (id. at 159โ63). QPP replies that these other alleged acts of retaliation \nare not properly before the Court because (1) they are โunexhausted claimsโ that fall outside the scope of the EEOC charge \nand (2) Landers cannot link these events to a protected activityโnamely, her complaints of racial harassment. Both \narguments are meritorious, particularly the latter. Landers repeatedly testified that she felt the acts described above were \nโretaliatory.โ She knew of no evidence, however, that would substantiate those feelings. (See generally Landers Dep., vol. 2, \n133โ66.) Such subjective โfeelingsโ aloneโwithout evidence from which a jury could reasonably find the causal link \nrequired for the claimโis not sufficient to withstand summary judgment.16 \n  \nThe plaintiff has failed to come forward with sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that Landersโ \ntransfer to the fecal contamination inspector position was an adverse employment action. The other alleged acts of \nโretaliationโ were not charged in the EEOCโs administrative process, and there is no evidence of a causal link between those \nacts and Landersโ EEOC charge. Accordingly, the retaliation claim will be dismissed. \n  5 \n \n\nE.E.O.C. v, Quality Pork Processors, Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n \n  \n \nConclusion \nBased on the foregoing, and all of the files, records and proceedings herein, IT IS ORDERED that Defendant Quality Pork \nProcessors, Inc.โs Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 17) is GRANTED IN PART. The EEOCโs claim for retaliation \nis hereby DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The parties will proceed to trial on the hostile work environment racial \ndiscrimination claim under Title VII. \n  \nParallel Citations \n88 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 99 \nFootnotes \n \n1  The factual background is presented here from the viewpoint of the non-moving party, in whose favor the Court is required to view \n  the evidence on a motion for summary judgment. See Graves v. Arkansas Depโt of Fin. & Admin., 229 F.3d 721, 723 (8th \nCir.2000); Calvit v. Minneapolis Pub. Schs., 122 F.3d 1112, 1116 (8th Cir.1997) \n \n2  Matlock was employed at QPP for several weeks. He was not working at QPP when Landersโ coworkers began making the racially \n  offensive comments to her. \n \n3  Im testified that he referred to Landersโ black boyfriend as a โniggerโ just one time during a conversation in which Landers had \n  told him that Matlock had hit her. (Dep. of Tha Im at 13โ14 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 11).) \n \n4  Hansen denies that Landers ever complained to him about co-workers making racially offensive remarks about her boyfriend. \n  (Dep. of Roger Hansen at 25โ26 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 9).) \n \n5  After Landers complained to Wicks about the attendance incident with Hansen, Wicks spoke to Hansen, telling him he could not \n  forbid an employee from working overtime where the employee had only missed one day of work. (Burnside Decl. Ex. 9 at 23 \n(Dep. of Roger Hansen).) \n \n6  QPP claims that, when Wicks said that QPP needed to investigate the matter and asked Landers to identify who had made the \n  remarks, she refused and declined to identify the department in which they worked. \n \n7  QPP describes this job as requiring the employee โto check each and every individual side of pork for small and minute bits of \n  foreign material. Foreign material which may be adhering to the side of pork meat could include fecal material, small pieces of \nliver, kidney or lung, and specks of grease. When an operator encounters such a piece of foreign material, the worker is required to \nโtrim offโ the contaminant as well as the meat around the place. This trimming work is performed by the job operator with a knife \nheld in gloved hands.โ (Burnside Decl. Ex. 6 at 11 (Def.โs Answers to Interrogs.).) \n \n8  Landers told Laack she wanted to file a grievance. Laack told her that he was not authorized to do that; the Union business agent, \n  Dennis LeBarron, was the person who would have to file a grievance. \n \n9  According to QPP, when Wicks again asked Landers to name the co-workers who had offended her, she refused, saying that the \n  problem was not ongoing and had been โtaken care of.โ \n \n10  According to QPP, the fecal contamination inspection post was temporary and was eliminated from both the day and night shifts \n  once it appeared that quality controls previously in place at the plant were working effectively and USDA inspectors were once \nagain performing their functions competently. The decision to eliminate the position was made in late June, at which time Landers \nwas given an opportunity to โbidโ for another job. (Def.โs Answers to Interrogs. at 10 (Burnside Decl. Ex. 6).) \n \n11  For purposes of the summary judgment motion, QPP concedes that Landers has standing to complain about the allegedly harassing \n  statements and that the complained-of conduct was based upon race. QPP further acknowledges that there is a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact as to whether it knew or should have known of the harassment but failed to take prompt and effective remedial action. \n(Def.โs Mem. Supp. Mot. for Summ. J. at 12.) \n \n12  QPP also argues that the racial statements that constituted the alleged harassment were not โunwelcomeโ for two reasons. (Def.โs \n  Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at 11โ12.) First, Landers initiated conversations with Guitierrez and Im about her boyfriend; any comments \n  6 \n \n\nE.E.O.C. v, Quality Pork Processors, Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n \narising out of those conversations could not be considered unwelcome. In addition, the noise level in the skinning room was so \nhigh that, if Landers wanted to avoid the offensive statements, she could have simply leaned away from the speaker and been \nunable to hear the comment. These arguments present disputed issues of fact on summary judgment, viewing the evidence in the \nlight most favorable to the EEOC, and are not persuasive. \n \n13  The supervisor also occasionally referred to the plaintiffโs wife, who was Caucasian, as โwhitey.โ 234 F.3d at 393. \n   \n14  In addition, the plant manager told Delph that he (the plant manager) had been invited to join the Ku Klux Klan and did not want to \n  tell the Klan representative that he (the plant manager) had โoneโ (i.e., a black person) working for him. 130 F.3d at 352. \n \n15  To the extent Landers argues that she felt negatively about the transfer, or that other workers at the plant saw the transfer as \n  reflecting negatively on her, those issues are insufficient as a matter of law to constitute an โadverse employment action.โ See \nLedergerber, 122 F.3d at 1144 (discussing Flaherty v. Gas Research Inst., 31 F.3d 451, 457 (7th Cir.1994), and Spring v. \nSheboygan Area Sch. Dist., 865 F.2d 883, 886 (7th Cir.1989)). \n \n16  At most, one could say that the record shows that these additional โretaliatoryโ acts occurred after Landers and the union met in \n  August 1999 to mediate her discrimination charge. QPP did not participate in that mediation. Merely because something occurs \nafter an event does not compel an inference that it occurs as a result of the event. \n \n \n \n \n  7 \n ",

The following will constitute \"Confidential Infonnation\": \n(a)  Medical documents produced by the parties with the word \n\"CONFIDENTIAL\" stamped thereon; \n(b)  Medical documents produced by the parties with an accompanying letter or \nother document that indicates that the documents, or a clearly designated \nportion of them, constitute Confidential Infonnation; \n(c)  Any medical documents or testimony relating to such documents that the \nparties subsequently agree in writing or on the record in a deposition to make \nsubject to this Order; and \n(d)  Any medical documents or testimony relating to such documents made subj ect \nto this Order by the Court. \n2.  Confidential Infonnation will not be given, shown, made available, communicated, \nor disclosed to anyone other than: \n(a)  The attorneys of record in this action and their associated attorneys, legal \nassistants, and staff members working on the action; \n(b)  Independent consultants and/or experts retained by the parties to work on the \naction, provided however, that before any such consultant or expert is shown \nor receives any Confidential Infonnation, he or she must read a copy of this \nStipulation and Order and agree in writing to abide by the same; \n(c)  Stenographic reporters engaged for deposition or other proceedings necessary \nto the conduct of the action; \n(d)  Such persons as the undersigned counsel shall mutually consent to in writing \nor on the record before the proposed disclosure; and \n(e )  The Court. \n3.  Confidential Infonnation will be used solely for the preparation, trial or settlement \nof the action, and will not be communicated or used for any other purpose whatsoever. \n4.  If any Confidential Infonnation is filed, included in, or referred to in any paper filed \n2 \n\nCase 0:01-cv-00143-RHK-JMM     Document 8     Filed 10/25/2001     Page 3 of 6(cid:10)\nwith the Court, counsel responsible for the filing will notify the Clerk of Court at the time of filing \nthat the paper contains Confidential Infonnation protected by this StipUlation and Order, and will \nnotify the other parties ofthe confidential nature ofthe filing.  The Clerk will keep the Confidential \nInfonnation under seal until further order of the Court; provided, however, that access to the \nConfidential Infonnation will be afforded to the Court and to counsel for the undersigned parties, \nand further provided that the parties agree to comply with any Local Rules or order relating to the \ntiling under seal that may be issued by the Court. \n5.  If, at the time oftrial or in connection with any pretrial or settlement hearing, counsel \nfor a party intends to introduce any Confidential Infonnation, he or she will infonn the Court and \nopposing counsel as far in advance as possible, and the Court may take such steps, at the request of \nthe opposing counselor on its own initiative, as it deems necessary to preserve thc confidentiality \nof the Confidential Infonnation. \n6.  A party will not be obligated to challenge the propriety of another party's designation \nof infonnation as \"confidential\" at the time the designation is made, and the failure to do so will not \npreclude a subsequent challenge.
