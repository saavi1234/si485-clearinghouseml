The Honorable Hector Lafitte, Chief District Judge of the U.S.\nDistrict Court of Puerto Rico, approved the settlement.\nThe monetary relief will be paid to Gerald E. Spillman, Jr., an employee of Cornell University at the Observatorio de Arecibo\nin San Juan, to settle the lawsuit filed by the EEOC on his behalf in April 1999. The lawsuit charged that La Cruz Azul, as an\ninsurance carrier, violated the ADA by providing Cornell University with an employee health insurance plan that excluded\ncoverage of medical services obtained outside Puerto Rico relating to AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses but which included\ncoverage for all other catastrophic illnesses obtained outside the Commonwealth.\n\"La Cruz Azul provided no evidence of a legitimate business reason for treating AIDS and related conditions differently from\nother catastrophic illnesses for which medical attention is sought outside Puerto Rico,\" said EEOC Chairwoman Ida L. Castro.\n\"This Decree sends a clear message to all employers and their insurance providers that they cannot discriminate against\npeople with disabilities by arbitrarily limiting health benefits. If they do, the EEOC will step in to protect those individuals.\"\nIn addition to compensating Mr. Spillman for the discrimination he suffered, La Cruz Azul agreed to eliminate the\ndiscriminatory provision from health insurance plans it offers employers in the future and to implement policies and\nprocedures to eliminate disability discrimination generally in its health plans and workplace. The agreement, entered in the\nform of a Consent Decree, will be in effect for five years, during which time the EEOC will monitor the company's compliance\nwith its provisions. Although La Cruz Azul denied the allegations in the lawsuit, it signed the Decree and entered into an\nagreement with the EEOC.\nSpencer H. Lewis, Director of the EEOC's New York District Office, which enforces the federal anti-discrimination laws in\nPuerto Rico, emphasized that nondiscrimination in health benefits is particularly crucial for workers with catastrophic\nillnesses such as AIDS. \"The EEOC will seek full relief against entities who discriminate,\" he said.\nSince 1992, EEOC has received a cumulative total of over 2,400 ADA charges alleging disability bias due to AIDS/HIV, about\n2% of all ADA charge filings, and obtained over $22 million for victims of such discrimination.\nIn addition to enforcing Title I of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in the private\nsector, state and local governments, the EEOC enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment\ndiscrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin; the Equal Pay Act; prohibitions against discrimination\naffecting individuals with disabilities in the federal sector; sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991; and the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act. Further information about the Commission is available on the agency's Web site at\nwww.eeoc.gov.\nThis page was last modified on December 6, 2000.\n Return to Home Page\n1 of 1 6/7/2007 12:28 PM",
