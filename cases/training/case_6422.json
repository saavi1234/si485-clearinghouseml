The case settled by entry of a consent decree in January 2007.  The three year consent decree required the defendant to pay the claimant $20,000 in damages and attorney's fees, refrain from discrimination, review and revise its anti-harassment policy, provide training for all of its employees on federal anti-discrimination laws, promote a \"Youth at Work Initiative\", post notice, give the EEOC reports every 90 days about any complaints that it receives, and allow the EEOC to monitor its compliance. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement took place; the case was presumably closed in 2010.",
