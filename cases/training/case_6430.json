The case was referred to mediation in January 1998 and in May 1998 the parties entered into a consent decree. </p><p>The decree provided for the Defendant to pay the charging party a total of $15,000, provide him with a neutral employment reference, and assume some the responsibility of the charging party's indebtedness to the Defendant's 401K plan. Defendant was enjoined from discriminating or retaliating in violation of the ADEA and was required to post a notice of non-discrimination at its facility and provide annual ADEA training to its employees. </p><p></p>",
