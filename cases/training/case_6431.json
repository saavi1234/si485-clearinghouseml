The EEOC claimed that the defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when it refused to accommodate an employee with ADD, then terminated him for asking for an accommodation.  The parties settled and a consent decree was entered in December 2006. The defendant agreed to pay the aggrieved party $30,000, refrain from retaliating and discriminating based on disability, implement an ADA/anti-discrimination policy, distribute and post its policy, post an EEO notice, provide EEO training to all its employees and CEO, hire an EEO consultant, implement a complaint procedure, make no references to this litigation in the aggrieved party's personnel file, issue an apology letter, and submit semiannual compliance/complaint reports to the EEOC. The docket sheet shows that no further enforcement took place; the case was presumably closed in 2008.",

In response to the paragraph in the First Amended Complaint entitled \n21 \n\"Nature of the Action\" RV Fun denies the allegations therein; RV Fun alleges that the \n22 \naction does appear to be brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n23 \nregarding Christiaan C. Calhoon who was reprimanded several times by RV Fun for \n24 \nsmoking around gas tanks and gas soaked rags, who later advised RV Fun that he suffers \n25 \nfrom \"episodic problems where disorganized thinking may occur\" and Attention Deficit \n26 \nDisorder and, who, as a result, posed a direct threat to the health or safety of other \n\n1  individuals in the RV Fun workplace that could not be eliminated by reasonable \n2  accommodation within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § § 12111(3) and 12113(b); RV Fun denies \n3  that Christiaan Calhoon suffers from a disability within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) \n4  because, among other reasons, his condition does not substantially limit one or more of his \n5  major life activities. \n6  2.  RV Fun admits the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 7 of the Complaint. \n7  3.  RV Fun denies the allegations of paragraph 8 of the Complaint and alleges \n8  that Christiaan Calhoon posed a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in \n9  the RV Fun workplace that could not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation within \n10  the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § § 12111(3) and 12113(b); RV Fun further alleges that Christiaan \n11  Calhoon does not suffer from a disability within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) \n12  because, among other reasons, his condition does not substantially limit one or more of his \n13  major life activities. \n14  4.  RV Fun is without lmowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as the \n15  to truth of the allegations in paragraph 9 that Christiaan Calhoon is experienced in \n16  commercial janitorial and cleaning work and therefore denies same; RV Fun admits that \n17  Christiann Calhoon worked in a cleaning capacity for RV Fun but, upon information and \n18  belief, alleges that his prior experience did not involve a potentially dangerous \n19  environment such as a RV /Boat dealership; RV Fun denies the remaining allegations of \n20  paragraph 9. \n21  5.  RV Fun denies the allegations of paragraphs 10,11,12, and 13. \n22  6.  RV Fun denies any allegations of the Complaint not otherwise specifically \n23  admitted or denied herein. \n24  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES \n25  7.  The Complaint must be dismissed because it fails to state a claim against RV \n26 \n-2-\n\n1  Fun upon which relief can be granted. \n2  8.  Christiaan Calhoon is not a qualified individual with a disability because he \n3  posed a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the RV Fun workplace \n4  that could not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation within the meaning of 42 \n5  U.S.C. § § 12111(3) and 12113(b) and, therefore, the Complaint must be dismissed. \n6  9.  Christiaan Calhoon does not suffer from a disability within the meaning of 42 \n7  U.S.C. § 12102 (2) because, among other reasons, his condition does not substantially limit' \n8  one or more of his major life activities and, therefore, the Complaint must be dismissed. \n9  10.  RV Fun made reasonable accommodation to Christiaan Calhoon by providing \n10  him with a list of his job duties and assignments when he asked for it before his written \n11  request for such a list on April 7, 2004. \n12  11.  The Complaint must also be dismissed on the basis of Christiaan Calhoon's \n13  failure to inform RV Fun at the time of his hire that he posed a direct threat to the health or \n14  safety of other individuals in the RV Fun workplace that could not be eliminated by \n15  reasonable accommodation within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § § 12111(3) and 12113(b). \n16  12.  The Complaint must also be dismissed on the basis of Christiaan Calhoon's \n17  failure to mitigate damages. \n18  13.  RV Fun specifically reserves its right to amend this Answer to set forth any \n19  additional defenses which might become available as and when discovery in this matter is \n20  conducted. \n21  WHEREFORE, having fully answered the Complaint, Defendant RV Fun \n22  respectfully requests: \n23  A.  That the Complaint be dismissed with prejudice and that Plaintiff take \n24  nothing thereby; \n25  B.  That RV Fun be awarded judgment against Plaintiff for RV Fun's attorneys' \n26 \n-3-\n\n1  fees and costs incurred herein; and \n2  C.

The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the \n8\njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. \n9\nPARTIES\n10\n3.  Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"Commission\"), is \n11\nthe agency of the United States of America charged with the administration, \n12\ninterpretation and enforcement of Title I of the ADA and is expressly authorized to bring \n13\nthis action by Section 107(a) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a), which incorporates by \n14\nreference Sections 706(f)(1) and (3)  of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  §§ 2000e-5(f)(1). \n15\n4.  At all relevant times, Defendant, RV Fun, Inc., an Arizona corporation, has \n16\ncontinuously been doing business in the state of Arizona and the city of Lake Havasu \n17\nCity, and has continuously had at least 15 employees. \n18\n5.  At all relevant times, Defendant has continuously been an employer engaged in an \n19\nindustry affecting commerce under Section 101(5) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.§ 12111(5), and \n20\nSection 101(7) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(7), which incorporates by reference \n21\nSections 701(g) and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e(g) and (h). \n22\n6.  At all relevant times, Defendant has been a covered entity under Section 101(2) of \n23\nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2). \n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n-2-\n\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS\n1\n7.  More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Christiaan Calhoon \n2\nfiled a charge with the Commission alleging violations of Titles I and V of the ADA by \n3\nDefendant RV Fun.  All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been \n4\nfulfilled.\n5\n8.  Christiaan Calhoon is a qualified individual with a disability and is covered by \n6\nTitle I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.\n7\n9.  Christiaan Calhoon is experienced in commercial janitorial and cleaning work and \n8\nworked in a janitorial and cleaning capacity for RV Fun. \n9\n10.

The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 10 were \n20\nintentional.\n21\n13.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 10 above were \n22\ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of \n23\nChristiaan Calhoon.\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n-3-\n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\n1\n  Wherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: \n2\nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant RV Fun, its officers, \n3\nsuccessors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from \n4\nengaging in those actions alleged in paragraph 10 and any other employment practice \n5\nwhich discriminates on the basis of disability. \n6\nB.  Order Defendant RV Fun to institute and carry out policies, practices, and \n7\nprograms which provide equal employment opportunities for qualified individuals with \n8\ndisability, and which eradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful employment \n9\npractices.\n10\nC.

Order Defendant RV Fun to make whole Christiaan Calhoon by providing \n17\ncompensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful \n18\npractices complained of in paragraph 10 above, including emotional pain, suffering, \n19\ninconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at \n20\ntrial.\n21\nE.  Order Defendant RV Fun to pay Christiaan Calhoon punitive damages for its \n22\nmalicious and reckless conduct, as described in paragraph 10 above, in amounts to be \n23\ndetermined at trial. \n24\nF.
