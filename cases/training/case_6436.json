After some scheduling orders and discovery, the parties settled in July 2005 through a consent decree.  The three-year decree, containing non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the defendant to: expunge the charging party's personnel file of all references to the charge of discrimination, provide her with a positive employment reference, implement and distribute an anti-discrimination policy, post an employee notice, provide Title VII training for all its employees, report to the EEOC at specified intervals, and pay the charging party $2,500. The docket sheet doesn't show any further enforcement took place; the case was presumably closed in 2008.",
