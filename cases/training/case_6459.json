The complaint alleged that the defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act when it refused to give overtime work to an employee because of his disability. Six days after the initial complaint was filed, the parties settled and a consent decree was entered in October 2005. The defendant agreed to pay the complainant almost $79,000, post an EEO notice, adopt and distribute an anti-discrimination policy, provide EEO training to is managers and supervisors, and submit semiannual complaint/compliance reports to the EEOC. The terms of the decree ran for two years.The decree was entered in 2005 and scheduled to last until 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.",

Defendant shall also provide EEOC with any and all copies of pamphlets, \nbrochures, outlines or other written material(s) provided to the participants of the training \nsession(s). \nMEDICAL RECORDS \n18.  Defendant recognizes the confidential nature of employee medical records and the \nneed to protect its employees' medical records and information from improper use or disclosure. \nDefendant will therefore maintain the confidentiality of information about its employees' medical \nconditions or histories in accordance with the ADA.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be \ninterpreted to prohibit Defendant from adopting reasonable medical confidentiality policies and \n\npractices to comply with law, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act and similar state laws. \nDISPUTE RESOLUTION \n19.  In the event that either party to this Decree believes that the other party has failed \nto comply with any provision(s) of the Decree, the complaining party shall notify the other party \nof the alleged non-compliance and shall afford the alleged non-complying party twenty (20) \nbusiness days to remedy the non-compliance or to satisfy the complaining party that the alleged \nnon-complying party has complied.

Each party to this Decree shall bear its own expenses and costs. EEOC and \nDefendant shall bear its own attorneys' fees. \n22.  This Consent Decree also completely resolves Charge of Discrimination \nNo. 2\\0-2003-33667, filed by Pincombe on or about June 30, 2003, against Commonwealth \nEdison Company/Exelon Corporation and extinguishes any all claims of Pincombe and EEOC \n\narising from or related to that Charge and the matters alleged therein, as to which Pincombe shall \nbe deemed to have received complete accord and satisfaction; provided, further, said Charge \nshall not constitute a basis for any further legal action or proceeding by EEOC against \nCommonwealth Edison Company or Exelon Corporation. \n23.  The terms of this Decree are and shall be binding upon the present and future \nrepresentatives, agents, directors, officers, assigns, and successors of Defendant in their \ncapacities as representatives, agents, directors and officers of Defendant, and not in their \nindividual capacities. \n24.
