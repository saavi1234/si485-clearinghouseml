The EEOC alleged that United Airlines had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e et seq.) by subjecting the employee to sexual and racial harassment and retaliating against her for complaining about the discrimination. The EEOC sought its costs, monetary and injunctive relief for the employee, including policy reform, back pay, compensation for emotional harm, and punitive damages.</p><p>The Court (Judge Suzanne B. Conlon) granted the employee's motion to intervene in the case on July 23, 2002. The employee's complaint proceeded under Title VII and elaborated on the harassment and retaliation to which she had been subjected. The employee sought substantially the same relief as the EEOC but also specifically sought reinstatement.</p><p>The parties reached a settlement, which the Court (Judge Harry D. Leinenweber) entered as a consent decree on April 13, 2004. The 2-year decree provided for monetary relief ($225,000 and 200,000 frequent flyer miles) and contained various injunctive provisions. United Airlines agreed to provide employment references according to normal procedure (which did not mention negative details), to post an EEOC notice, to maintain records of complaints of racial and sexual harassment and their resolution, to make reports to the EEOC every six months, and to provide all supervisors and managers with annual Title VII training. The parties bore their own costs. The decree was subject to extra conditions related to United Airlines' bankruptcy case, but it appears that the bankruptcy did not affect the decree. No further court activity appears on the docket and the case is now closed.</p>",

(\"Title VII\") and \nTitle ofthe Civil Rights Act ofl991, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a.  The EEOC seeks relieffor Phyllis \nPowell (\"Ms. Powell\" or the \"Charging Party\"), who filed a charge of discrimination. \nIn the interest of resolving this matter, and as a result of comprehensive settlement \nnegotiations, the parties have agreed that this action should be finally resolved by entry of this \nConsent Decree.  This Consent Decree fully and finally resolves any and all issues and claims \narising out of the Charge of Discrimination filed by Ms. Powell (EEOC Charge No. 210A02067) \nand the Complaint filed by the EEOC and by Powell in this action. \nOn December 9, 2002, United Airlines and several affiliated companies (VAL \nCORPORATION, et al,) (the \"Debtors\"), filed petitions for relief pursuant to Chapter II of Title \nCHI 10635505.2 \n\n-' \n,  II of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\").  These cases are being jointly \nadministered under Case No. 02-48191 through 02-48218 before the Honorable Judge Eugene R. \nWedoff in the Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Illinois (the \"Bankruptcy Case\"). \nFINDINGS \nHaving carefully examined the tenns and provisions of this Decree, and based on the \npleadings, records and stipulations of the parties, the Court finds the following: \nA.

The rights of the \nparties and the public interest are adequately protected by this Decree. \nC.  This Decree conforms with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Title VII and \nis not in derogation of the rights or privileges of any person.

D/B/A\nUNITED AIRLINES, Jury Trial Demanded\nDefendant,\nINTERVENORโSCOMPLAINT\nIntervenor Phyllis Powell, by her attomeys Favaro, Buzek & Gorman, Ltd., and\nBeeler, Schad & Diamond, P.C., complains against defendant United Air Lines, inc.,\nd/b/a as United Airlines (\"United\")\nNature Of The Action\nThis is an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42\nU.S.C. ยง 2000e, et seq. (Title VII), and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of i991, 42 U.S.C.\nยง 1981 a, seeking relief for plaintiff Phyllis Powell (\"Powell\"), for discrimination in the\nterms and conditions of her employment based on her sex, female, and her race, Black.\nUnited subjected Powell to sexual and racial harassment, and after she complained of\nemployment discrimination, United retaliated against her by subjecting her to different\nterms and conditions of employment, and by discharging her, in violation of Title VII.\nPowell brings this complaint to intervene in the action brought by the U.S. Equal~\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").\n\nJurisdiction And Venue\n1. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1337, and\n1343. The action is brought pursuant to Sections 706(f)(1) and (3) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.\nยถ 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3), and pursuant to Section I02 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1981a.\n2. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยถ 1391(b) and (c), and 42 U.S.C.\nยง 2000e-5(f)(3). Unitedโs headquarters are in this district, and its illegal employment\npractices occurred in this district.\nParties\n3. EEOC is an agency of the United States of America charged with the\nadministration, interpretation and enforcement of Title VII.\n4. At all relevant times United is a corporation doing business in Cook\nCounty, Illinois. United has more than fifteen employees, and is an employer engaged in\nan industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(b)(g)\nand (h).\n5. Powell was an employee of United within the meaning of Title VII, 42\nU.S.C. ยง 2000e(f).\nAdministrative Prerequisites\n6. Powell filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days of\nUnitedโs acts of discrimination, and more than 30 days prior to the filing of this lawsuit.\nPowell has fulfilled all conditions precedent to the filing of this action.\n\nVioIations of Title VII\n6. Powell was hired by United in early May, 1999, to work as a ramp service\nemployee at OโHare airport. The duties of ramp service employees include loading and\nunloading baggage on airplanes and at the temainal.\n7. Beginning at the end of May, 1999, while at work at United, Powell was\nsubjected to repeated sexual and racial harassment, including unwanted touching, racial\nslurs, and sexual comments about parts of her body. For example, male employees\nintentionally brushed against her breasts, and asked her if her breasts were real. Racial\nand sexual slurs, such as \"black bitch\" or comments referring to Powellโs breasts, were\nwritten on the tabie in the employeesโ break room.\n8. After Powell complained to United about being harassed, United retaliated\nby subjecting her to significantIy worse terms and conditions of employment than those\nenjoyed by other workers. Powellโs supervisor assigned her to work for extended periods\nby herself in the pit, the underbelly of airplanes where baggage is stored. Normally ramp\nservice employees work in the pit in pairs, and regularly rotate to other assignments,\nbecause work in the pit is very hot, cramped and involves substantial lifting under\nawkward conditions.\n9. Powellโs supervisor did nothing to improve the racially and sexually\nhostile environment to which Poweli was subjected, but instead encouraged the hostile\nenvironment by saying in from of other employees that he did not understand why United\nkept hiring \"black bitches\".\n10. Despite her complaints, Powell was continually subjected to a hostile\nenvironment and retaliation until United discharged her in August, 1999.\n\n11. Unitedโs actions deprived Powetl of equal employment opportunities and\notherwise adversely affected her status as an employee because of her sex, female, and\nrace, Black.\n12. Unitedโs actions were done intentionally, and with malice or with reckless\nindifference to Powellโs federally protected fights.\n13. As a result of Unitedโs illegal discrimination and retaliation, Powell\nsuffered loss of income, loss of career opportunities, severe humiliation and emotional\ndistress.\nWHEREFORE, Phyllis Powell requests the Court to enter judgment in her favor\nand against United, and awarding Powell:\nA.    Reinstatement with no loss of seniority, vesting or benefits;\nB.    Back pay, prejudgment interest and compensation for other pecuniary\nlosses;\nFront pay;\nCompensatory damages for pain, suffering, emotional distress,\ninconvenience and mental anguish;\nE.
