    "summary": "<p>In 1977, inmates at the Maryland House of Correction (\"MHC\") filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 against the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  The plaintiffs, who were represented in part by the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had violated their constitutional rights by allowing MHC to become dangerously overcrowded, subjecting them to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  In 1978, a similar lawsuit was filed challenging the conditions at the Maryland Correctional Institute (\"MCI\") at Hagerstown, Maryland.   The cases were subsequently consolidated.</p><p>On May 17, 1978, the District Court (Judge Alexander Harvey II) granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, finding that the prison was unconstitutionally overcrowded and ordering the prison to discontinue the use of double-celling.  The Court ruled that the parties to the lawsuit must try to agree upon an appropriate plan for elimination of overcrowding, warning that if no agreement could be reached, the court would itself determine what relief would be entered.  Johnson v. Levine, 450 F.Supp. 648 (D.Md. 1978).  The defendants appealed.</p><p>In the interim, the defendants came forth with a plan involving construction of a new facility, conversion of an old facility, and early release of prisoners that were believed to be appropriate for release.  They claimed that under this plan, the overcrowded conditions would be gone by June 1, 1980.  On December 13, 1978, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a per curiam opinion partially affirming the District Court's decision, holding that the prisons were unconstitutionally overcrowded, but finding that the defendants' plan to alleviate overcrowding deserved judicial approval.  Johnson v. Levine, 588 F.2d 1378 (4th Cir. 1978).</p><p>We are unsure about whether the District Court adopted the defendants' proposed plan, but in 1983, the parties entered into a stipulated agreement providing for population caps and other procedures to address the conditions at both facilities.  In 1987, the plaintiffs moved to modify that agreement.  As a result of negotiations, the parties entered into a new stipulated agreement on July 8, 1987, resolving a majority of the claims raised by the plaintiffs.  </p><p>On December 3, 1987, the parties agreed to a supplemental stipulated agreement resolving the remaining issues.  These agreements provided comprehensive prospective relief governing a broad spectrum of issues:  population limitations, double-celling, environmental conditions, repair and replacement of windows, plumbing fixtures, painted surfaces, roofing, ventilation systems, food services, security, work programs, recreational programs, educational programs, and healthcare.  The District Court approved these agreements on February 19, 1988.  </p><p>On March 8, 1990, the parties jointly stipulated that there were still critical issues in the areas of healthcare, nutrition, environmental conditions, fire safety, and population limits at both institutions involved in this litigation.  The parties agreed that the plaintiffs' experts would work together with the defendants to develop specific plans to come into compliance with the stipulated agreements.  In return, the defendants agreed not to increase the population at either facility until they were back within the proper population limits, except in an emergency and after notification of the plaintiffs' attorney.  </p><p>During the negotiations that followed, the parties compiled a list of 83 repairs that needed to be maid at the two facilities.  The prison officials provided a timetable of projected dates for completing the repairs, but insisted that they were tentative and conditions at all times on obtaining needed funding.  Over the next year, the prison officials made substantial progress in completing the repairs, finishing 69 of the 83 items by July 31, 1991.  On June 7, 1991, the prisoners asked the District Court to convert the timetable into a court order and to fine the prison officials $1000 per day for each day that the improvements were delayed, following a 30-day grace period.  </p><p>On September 19, 1991, the District Court (Judge William M. Nickerson) issued an order approving the timetable as an official agreement (over the objections of the defendants), but denying the request for automatic penalties.  The defendants appealed, and on February 22, 1993, the Fourth Circuit (James Harvie Wilkinson III) reversed the District Court's order and held that the timetable could not be enforced as an agreement between the parties.  Johnson v. Robinson 987 F.2d 1043 (4th Cir. 1993).  </p><p>On October 15, 1996, the defendants asked the District Court to terminate the consent decrees in this case pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\").  The plaintiffs objected, arguing that the PLRA was unconstitutional.  On February 26, 1997, the District Court (Judge Nickerson) held that the PLRA was constitutional and that it required the immediate termination of the consent decrees and stipulations that had been approved by the Court in this case because the plaintiffs were unable to point to any ongoing constitutional violation.</p><p></p>",

Civil No. H-78-1730\nJAMES P. TINNEY, et al.,\nDefendants.\nSUPPLEMENTAL STIPULATED AGREEMENT\nI.  Introduction\nOn  February  18, 1983, a  Stipulation  in this  action was\nentered into by the parties and approved on June 3, 1983 by this\nCourt.  This  1983 Stipulation  was  entered  into  to  provide\ndefendants with interim mechanisms for addressing overcrowding at\nthe Maryland House of Correction in Jessup, Maryland  (hereinafter\nMHC) ,  and the Maryland  correctional  Institution  in Hagerstown,\nMaryland  (hereinafter  MCI-H)  without  the pressure  of  strict\nlimits on the population numbers and types of housing facilities\nimposed  by the Court  in 450 F.Supp.  648 (D.Md. 1978) and 479\nF.Supp. 569 (D.Md. 1979).\nEHTtKCO\nJohnson v. Galley\nFยฃB  2\"  1983\nPC-MD-003-003 AT  โข M . M Ql\nCIS** U.S. DISTRICT COURT\nqjSTKlCT OF MARYLAND\nDEPUTY\nBV\n\n2\nThe 1983 Stipulation requires defendants to ensure that the\ninstitutions  meet  certain  specified  criteria  while  utilizing\ninterim mechanisms  for housing prisoners at MCI-H and MHC.  The\npresent  conditions  in  these  institutions  and  defendants'\npopulation  requirements  since  the  1983  Stipulation  was  entered\ninto, however, evidence  a need  to modify  the 1983  Stipulation.\nOn February 18, 1987, after evaluating the nature of plaintiffs'\nconfinement  since  1983,  plaintiffs'  counsel  filed  an  Amended\nMotion  for Further Relief  and Modification  of the June  3, 1983\nStipulation.  On July  8,  1987, the parties signed a Stipulated\nAgreement  settling  a  majority  of  the  claims  raised  by  the\nplaintiffs  in their Amended  Motion  for Further Relief.  It was\napproved by the Court on October 2, 1987.\nThere were four major issues not covered by the Stipulated\nAgreement:  provision  of  outdoor  and  in-cell  activity  to\nprisoners  in disciplinary  segregation, sick call procedures  for\ngeneral population and segregation prisoners and overcrowding in\nthe Western  Program Development  Center  (WPDC).  The parties are\nentering  into  this  supplemental  stipulated  agreement  to  settle\nthese four outstanding issues.\nThe defendants by entering into this agreement, however, do\nnot  admit  that  any  acts  complained  of  in  Plaintiffs'  Amended\nMotion  for Further Relief  and Modification  of the June  3, 1983\nStipulation  constitute  violations  of  that  Stipulation  or  the\nUnited  States  Constitution.  Likewise,  by  entering  into  this\nAgreement,  members  of  the  plaintiff  class  are  not waiving  any\n\n3\nrights  to  pursue  individual  claims  for monetary  relief  arising\nout of the conditions this Supplemental  Stipulated Agreement  is\ndesigned to correct.\nPlaintiffs  and  defendants,  therefore,  have  voluntarily\nagreed  to  the  provisions  of  this  Supplemental  Stipulated\nAgreement,  which  modifies  the June  3,  1983  Stipulation.  This\nStipulated  Agreement  shall  become  effective  on  the  date  it  is\napproved by the Court.\nII.  Compliance Monitoring\nA.  For a period of three years following approval of this\nSupplemental Stipulated Agreement by the Court, defendants shall\nsubmit monthly reports to the plaintiffs and the Court describing\ncompliance  with  the  terms  of  this  Supplemental  Stipulated\nAgreement.  The  format of the report shall be developed by the\nplaintiffs  and  defendants  and  a  copy  shall  be  attached  as  an\nappendix to this agreement.\nB.  The  defendants  are  required  by  the  October  2,  1987\nStipulated  Agreement  to  submit  to  the  Court  for  approval,\nimplementation  plans  developed  pursuant  to  the  Stipulated\nAgreement.  The parties  agree that plaintiffs' experts will be\nincluded  in the  plan  development  discussions  among  defendants'\nstaff or consultants prior to defendants finalizing the plan and\nsubmitting it to the Court.  The plans for implementation of the\nprovisions  of  this  Supplemental  Stipulated  Agreement  shall  be\nincorporated  into  the  plans  to  be  submitted  pursuant  to  the\nStipulated Agreement  i.e., the plans required  for the provision\n\n4\nof health care, segregation utilization, population reduction and\nprogramming.\nC.  All plans approved by the Court addressing the  issues\nin this Supplemental Stipulated Agreement shall become appendices\nto this agreement.  Each party may request a modification to the\nplan  so  appended.  No  modification  shall  be  approved  which\nchanges  the  underlying  purpose  of  this  Supplemental  Stipulated\nAgreement:  to  provide  for  daily  medical  coverage  to  the\nsegregation  unit,  sick  call  at  least  5 days a week to  general\npopulation prisoners, reduce idleness in disciplinary segregation\nand increase the living space at WPDC to at least 50 square feet\nper prisoner exclusive of hygiene facilities and dayroom space.\nD.  Counsel  for  plaintiffs  shall,  upon  request  to  the\ndefendants,  receive  any  documents, not  otherwise  privileged  by\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence, which may demonstrate  compliance\nor  lack  of  compliance  with  the  terms  of  this  Supplemental\nStipulated Agreement.  Counsel  for plaintiffs shall have  access\nto members of the plaintiff class at reasonable times and under\nreasonable  circumstances.  Plaintiffs'  counsel,  including  any\nexperts selected by them, upon reasonable notice to defendants'\ncounsel,  shall have access to MCI-H and MHC for the purpose of\nmaking observations concerning compliance.\nE.  After the expiration of the three years described in II\nA above, the Court shall hold a hearing to determine the need for\ncontinued monitoring of this Supplemental Stipulated Agreement.\n\n5\nIII. Health Care\nThe defendants agree to provide a system of ready access by\nprisoners to nonemergency medical care.  As a part of that system\nthey agree to the following:\nA.  Sick  call  shall  be  held  five  days  a  week  for\nprisoners in both general population and segregation.  Prisoners\nshall be able to submit their sick call requests on any day and\nwill  be  seen  in  sick  call  by  a  medical  professional  within\ntwenty-four  hours  of  making  that  request.  Requests  made  on\nFriday and Saturday shall be scheduled for the following Monday.\nB.  There shall be daily rounds made in segregation by\na physician's assistant.  The rounds shall be made during normal\nwaking hours.  In addition to responding to any written requests\nfor  sick  call  during  these  daily  rounds,  the  physician's\nassistant  shall  speak  to  each  prisoner  in  segregation  to\ndetermine  whether  there  is a  need  for medical  care,  including\nmental  health  and  dental  care.  This  person  shall  provide  the\nnecessary  medical  treatment  or make the necessary  referral  for\nsuch  treatment.  Medical  rounds,  in  addition  to  medical\ntreatment, shall be documented.\nIV.  Segregation\nA.  The defendants shall provide the prisoners assigned to\ndisciplinary  segregation  for  longer  than  sixty  days  with  an\nopportunity  to  be  involved  in  an  in-cell  education  and\nrecreational program including access to games and crafts.\n\n6\nB.  The  defendants  are  required  by  the  October  2,  1987\nStipulated  Agreement  to  develop  a  plan  for  the  utilization  of\nsegregation units in the subject facilities.  In addition to the\nspecifications  in the Stipulated Agreement the defendants agree\nto address the following issues in that plan:\n1.  The  specific  types  of  in-cell  programming  to  be\nprovided prisoners in disciplinary segregation.\n2;  The provision  of structured  exercise  activity  to\nprisoners  in  disciplinary  segregation  including  access  to\noutdoor exercise.\n3.  Sentencing practices  for disciplinary  segregation\nincluding  sentence  lengths,  consecutive  sentences  and\nprocedures for vacating sentences.\n4.  The  reasons  for  assignment  to  the  security  unit\nand  the  appropriateness  of  assigning  prisoners  with  a\nhistory of mental illness to that unit.\n5.  The reasons for assignment to the isolation units\nand the length of such assignment.\n6.  The  expansion  of  the  unit  now  at  MCI-H  for\nprisoners with behavioral or mental health problems who need\nspecial programming but are not ill enough to be admitted to\na mental health unit.\n7.  The  provision  of  mental  health  services  to\nprisoners in segregation.\n\n7\n8.  The  assignment  of  prisoners  in  administrative\nsegregation, protective custody and disciplinary segregation\nto the same tier.\n9.  The development  and  implementation  of the  levels\nprogram in segregation and its effect on sentence length.\nV.  Population  Reduction  in  the  Western  Program  Development\nCenter\nThe  October  2,  1987  Stipulated  Agreement  specifically\nexcluded  the  Western  Program  Development  Center  from  the\npopulation  reduction  requirements  of  the  agreement.  The\npopulation  in the Western  Program  Development  Center  (WPDC)  is\ncurrently 420 prisoners, A and B units each housing 180 prisoners\nand C Unit housing 60 prisoners.\nThe defendants shall provide the prisoners in the WPDC with\na minimum of 50 square feet of living space exclusive of dayroom\nspace and hygiene facilities by December 31, 1988.  To meet this\ngoal the defendants shall reduce the population by 80 prisoners\nby June  30, 1988 and by an additional  60 prisoners by  December\n31,  1988.  The  defendants  shall  also  immediately  provide\nprisoners housed in the WPDC six and one-half hours per day out-\nof-unit time exclusive of meals, one and one-half hours more than\nthe  parties  agreed  to  in the  Stipulated  Agreement  approved  in\nOctober.\nVI.  Modification  of  1981  Orders  Concerning  Transfers  to  the\nFederal System\nBy orders of April 27, 1981 and November 3, 1981 the court\ndirected that the defendants house up to 50 \"volunteer\" Division\n\n8\nof Corrections' prisoners with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the\ncost of said housing to be paid by the Division of Corrections.\nIt is agreed that upon approval of this Supplemental Stipulation,\nthe defendants may discontinue housing such \"volunteer\" prisoners\nwith the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  This shall be accomplished\nby  attrition,  i.e.,  the  defendants  will  not  replace  volunteer\nprisoners  as  they  are  released,  paroled  or  returned  to  the\nDivision of Corrections.  This shall not prevent the defendants\nfrom voluntarily  contracting  with  Federal  Bureau  of Prisons to\nhouse Division of Corrections' prisoners  should the  defendants\nso choose.\nVII. The Court's Continuing Jurisdiction\nThe Court  shall  retain jurisdiction of the  above-captioned\ncases  and  shall  retain  discretionary  authority,  subject  to all\napplicable  provisions  of  law concerning  modification  where  not\notherwise  modified  by  this  Stipulation,  to  modify,  either\nprospectively or retrospectively, any provisions hereof.  Either\nparty may at any time apply to this Court for modification of any\nand all provisions of this Stipulation, upon appropriate notice.\nEither  party  may  seek  enforcement  of  the  provisions  of  this\nagreement  by  appropriate  motion.  No  modification  shall  be\ngranted which changes the underlying purpose of this  Stipulated\nAgreement described in II A, supra.\n\nRichard Kastendieck  * Adj oalA.

Gen. of Md., Baltimore,\nMd., for defendants.\nALEXANDER HARVEY, II, District Judge:\nIn this consolidated class action, the plaintiffs, who are state prisoners, are challenging as unconstitutional\nconditions of confinement at the Maryland House of Correction (the \"MHC\"), a medium-security penal institution\nunder the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services of the State of Maryland. The\nessential claim here is that the MHC is unconstitutionally overcrowded and that, as a result, the plaintiffs are\nbeing deprived of various rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\n650 Commencing in early 1977, many different suits were filed in this Court under 42 *650 U.S.C. ยง 1983 by inmates\n[1]\nconfined in the MHC, all raising the basic question of overcrowding at that institution.  Orders were entered\nconsolidating three of these suits and certifying Civil No. H-77-113 as a class action, pursuant to Rule 23,\n[2]\nF.R.Civ.P.  The class includes all persons who are now or will be in the future confined to the Maryland House\nof Correction and who are state prisoners convicted and sentenced in state courts and remanded to the custody\n[3]\nof the Commissioner of Corrections.  Other individual suits raising the same questions presented herein have\nbeen stayed pending the outcome of this consolidated class action.\nNamed as defendants in this case are the Commissioner of the Maryland Division of Correction, the Warden of\nthe MHC, the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, and the\nGovernor of the State. Plaintiffs here seek only declaratory and injunctive relief.\nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs assert that the MHC is severely overcrowded and that the degree of overcrowding\nthreatens the physical and psychological safety of its inmates and otherwise violates their rights under the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, plaintiffs assert inadequacies at the MHC in medical facilities,\nsanitation and hygiene, vocational and other rehabilitative programs, psychological and psychiatric counseling\nand facilities, discipline and punishment, parole and release procedures and the operation of a meaningful\nclassification system. Defendants concede that the MHC is overcrowded from a correctional point of view, but\nassert that the institution's overcrowded condition does not reach constitutional proportions. Defendants further\ncontend that inmates at the MHC receive adequate food, shelter and medical care, and that the institution's\nmedical and psychiatric facilities and its programs and services are adequate to meet constitutional standards.\n\nThe parties have agreed that the basic and central questions to be decided by the Court are whether the MHC is\nunconstitutionally overcrowded, and if so, the number of inmates which can be constitutionally confined at the\ninstitution. As relief, the plaintiffs, inter alia, specifically request that the Court limit the number of inmates\nconfined at the MHC to 912, that the Court order that facilities at the MHC known as the \"punitive segregation\narea\" and the \"Special Confinement Area\" (the \"SCA\") be closed, that the Court order the defendants to provide\nadditional medical personnel and emergency treatment and equipment to meet the medical needs of inmates at\nthe MHC, and that attorney's fees be awarded to counsel for the plaintiffs.\nFollowing extensive pretrial discovery and numerous conferences with the Court, the case came on for trial\n[4]\nbefore both the undersigned Judge and Judge Blair, sitting without a jury.  Shortly before the trial, the\n651 undersigned Judge, accompanied by counsel, made an extensive tour of substantially *651 all areas of the MHC.\n[5]\n Most of the basic facts were stipulated, and the evidence presented at the trial consisted mainly of the\ntestimony of correctional and other experts called by the parties. The case has now been submitted on the\nstipulations, testimony produced at the trial and the numerous exhibits admitted in evidence. Findings of fact and\nconclusions of law under Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P., are embodied in this Opinion, whether or not expressly so\ncharacterized.\nThe facts\nOriginally constructed some one hundred years ago, the MHC has had various additions and new facilities added\nfrom time to time since then. The basic structure is a typical 19th-Century stone institution. With the various\n[6]\nadditions and improvements over the years, the MHC is today designed to house 1100 inmates.  However, the\ninstitution had a population on March 10, 1978 of 1708 prisoners.\nPrisoners in Maryland are classified as maximum security, medium security and minimum security. Typically, a\nmedium security inmate is a person who has an intermediate length sentence or who has served a considerable\npart of a longer sentence without demonstrating a need for continued maximum security treatment. Many\nmedium security inmates are transferred to minimum security institutions during the latter part of their terms.\nApproximately 30% of the inmates at the MHC are participating in academic or vocational programs in\npreparation for transition to minimum security status.\nThe main prison building is designed with a central structure controlling access to the two principal housing\nareas, namely the South and the West Wings. Each wing has a two-sided central core of cells, four tiers high,\neach tier having between forty and forty-nine individual cells. Each cell contains roughly forty square feet, and a\ngreat many cells in the South and West Wings contain two inmates. Each cell in the South and West Wings\ncontains, in addition to one or two bunks, a toilet, a sink and usually a shelf, locker or stool. Hot water is available\nin each cell. The wings share a single shower room with fifty shower heads, providing a ratio of one shower for\nevery twenty-four men, based on present population.\nHousing for inmates at the MHC is also available in six dormitory areas. These areas presently provide\napproximately fifty-five square feet per inmate bed space and eighty square feet per inmate, including recreation\narea.\nOf the three principal inmate housing areas, the West Wing was opened in 1879, the South Wing in 1928 and H, I\nand J Dormitories in 1955. Other substantial additions to the physical plant include an Administration Annex in\n1958, an industries compound opened in 1964, a new power plant in 1970, major improvements to the main\ndining room in 1974, a gymnasium in 1974 and a new hospital in 1975.\nOn the south side of the West Wing, the first two tiers, designated E-1 and E-2, are used to house inmates\nsubject to administrative segregation. Prisoners who have violated institutional rules and regulations are confined\nhere on a single-celled basis, following administrative hearings. Inmates in administrative segregation are fed in\ntheir cells, are permitted to leave their cells for recreation for only one hour a day, and are otherwise more\nrestricted in their activities than prisoners in the general population.\n\nThe dining facility, which is located in the main housing unit, seats 500 inmates at one time. It is therefore\nnecessary to have three feeding shifts for each meal. Much of the kitchen equipment is antiquated.\nThe Special Confinement Area (the \"SCA\") consists of fifty individual cells in two rows of twenty-five each, which\n652 are *652 back to back and share a common rear wall. The SCA was designed to house inmates who have\npsychological or psychiatric problems and who therefore must be separated from others in the general\npopulation. Inmates confined in the SCA remain in their cells approximately twenty-three hours a day and are\nallowed one hour exercise per day. Many of the cells have no beds but only mattresses. No hot water is available\nin the cells, but one of the fifty cells has been converted to a shower for use by the inmates. Prisoners confined\nhere are fed in their cells.\nThe punitive segregation area consists of ten cells located beneath the main dining room in the basement of the\ninstitution. These cells are approximately forty square feet in size and have no running water. No beds are\nprovided, only mattresses, and the only toilet facility is a mesh bar opening in the floor. Inmates are confined in\nthis area as punishment for short periods of time.\nRecreational facilities include a large indoor area in the South Wing, an outdoor recreation yard and a recently\nconstructed gymnasium. The gymnasium building contains a full-size basketball court and bleachers and is often\nused as a movie theater. Television rooms with pool and table tennis tables are included within this building.\nThere is also a library and an adjoining activities area where inmate organizations may hold meetings.\nThe main visiting room holds up to twenty-three inmates and sixty-nine visitors at one time. Plans are being\nprepared by the Division of Correction for converting in the near future the old auditorium in the main building into\na large visiting hall, which would provide more space, better security and a more pleasant atmosphere for\ninmates and their visitors.\nA new hospital accommodating twenty-eight patients has recently been opened. This facility includes several\nexamining rooms, two dental offices, an X-ray room and various other storerooms and offices. Two licensed\nphysicians are on the premises twenty hours a week per doctor, or a total of forty hours, and in the absence of\ndoctors, nurses are on duty in the hospital. Two psychiatrists are also available on a consulting basis. Emergency\ncases are taken to the University Hospital in Baltimore.\nClassification activities and offices are located in a building which adjoins the South Wing. The classification staff\nincludes two supervisors, fourteen counselors and two full-time psychologists. These figures result in an average\ncaseload per counselor of 120.\nThe MHC operates a school consisting of nine classrooms, each of which can accommodate twenty-five\nstudents. Classes operate at above capacity level on most days, and there is a waiting list of inmates who wish to\nparticipate in the academic program. The vocational education program at the MHC operates courses in welding,\ncarpentry, shipfitting and office practices. The State Use Industries Unit operates auto tags, sign, mattress, paint,\nselling and woodworking shops manned by inmate labor. 302 vocational jobs are available at the MHC, and a\nmaximum of 455 inmates can participate in educational programs at the institution, including basic education,\nintermediate education, high school education, special typing and college courses.\nThere has been a sharp increase in recent years in the number of inmates assigned to the Maryland Division of\nCorrection. The Division's inmate population has increased from 4941 in the first quarter of 1972 to 8064 in the\nlast quarter of 1976. The incidence of crimes committed in Maryland has shown a steady increase beginning in\nthe mid-1960's and continuing to date.\nThe applicable law\nTo be entitled to the relief they seek here, plaintiffs must show that they have been subjected to \"cruel and\nunusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Particularly in recent years,\nfederal courts have taken an increasingly enlightened and progressive approach in finding that conditions of\n653 confinement in state penal institutions violate Eighth Amendment precepts. Sostre v.*653McGinnis, 442 F.2d\n\n178 (2d Cir. 1971),cert. denied, sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972);\nBundy v. Cannon, 328 F.Supp. 165 (D.Md. 1971); Landman v. Royster, 354 F.Supp. 1302 (E.D.Va.1973); see \nCollins v. Schoonfield, 363 F.Supp. 1152, 1155-56 (D.Md. 1973). In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102-3, 97\nS.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), the Supreme Court said that the proscription embraced within the term \"cruel\nand unusual punishment\" was not to be considered as a static but rather as a progressive concept, covering any\npunishment of a prisoner which at the time was regarded as \"incompatible with `the evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.'\" See Hite v. Leeke, 564 F.2d 670, 672 (4th Cir. 1977).\nOn the other hand, the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit in recent years have cautioned that a federal judge\nmust act with restraint when questions pertaining to conditions in and the management of correctional institutions\nare presented. The problems of prison management are \"complex and intractable\" and are \"not readily\nsusceptible to resolution by decree.\" Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d\n224 (1974). Thus, federal courts have traditionally adopted \"a broad hands-off attitude toward problems of prison\nadministration.\" Id. at 404, 94 S.Ct. at 1807.\nIt is axiomatic that a lawfully convicted and sentenced state prisoner must necessarily suffer the loss of rights and\nprivileges which ordinary citizens enjoy to the fullest extent. The Supreme Court has stated that \"`lawful\nincarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction\njustified by the considerations underlying our penal system.'\" Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, 94 S.Ct. 2800,\n2804, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974) (quoting from Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356\n(1948)). It has been pointed out that federal courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional\nrights of all persons, including prisoners. Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972); \nMeachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 229, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976). Moreover, where state penal\ninstitutions are involved, federal courts have a further reason for deferring to the appropriate prison authorities, \nProcunier v. Martinez, supra 416 U.S. at 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, in view of \"the strain placed upon the federal-state\nrelationship\" as a result of federal intervention in state prisons. Battle v. Anderson, 564 F.2d 388, 391 (10th Cir.\n1977). Because of a lack of judicial expertise, prison officials must be accorded latitude in the administration of\nprison affairs, Cruz v. Beto, supra 405 U.S. at 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, and their decisions \"are entitled to\nconsiderable weight . . ..\" Ross v. Blackledge, 477 F.2d 616, 618 (4th Cir. 1973). In Sweet v. South Carolina\nDepartment of Corrections, 529 F.2d 854, 859 (4th Cir. 1975), the Fourth Circuit summed up its review of the law\nin this area by stating:\nCourts are accordingly limited in their exercise of power in this area to deprivations which\nrepresent constitutional abuses and they cannot prohibit a given condition or treatment in prison\nmanagement unless it reaches the level of an unconstitutional deprivation. It has been well said\nthat \"[C]ourts encounter numerous cases in which the acts or conditions under attack are clearly\nundesirable and are condemned by penologists, but the courts are powerless to act because the\npractices are not so abusive as to violate a constitutional right.\" Note, Decency and Fairness: An\nEmerging Judicial Role in Prison Reform, 72 Va.L.Rev. 841, 843 (1971).\nIn spite of these recent pronouncements by the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit, one cannot help but be\nstruck by the number of occasions in recent years when federal courts have felt compelled to intervene in the\ninternal affairs of prison management when conditions have been challenged as being unconstitutional because\nof overcrowding. Battle v. Anderson, supra; McCray v. Sullivan, 509 F.2d 1332 (5th Cir. 1975); Finney v. Arkansas\n654 Board of Correction,*654 505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir. 1974); Chapman v. Rhodes, 434 F.Supp. 1007 (S.D.Ohio 1977); \nPalmigiano v. Garrahy, 443 F.Supp. 956 (D.R.I.1977); Anderson v. Redman, 429 F.Supp. 1105 (D.Del.1977); \nMitchell v. Untreiner, 421 F.Supp. 886 (N.D.Fla.1976); Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318 (M.D.Ala. 1976),aff'd in\npart and rev'd in part, sub nom. Newman v. State of Alabama, 559 F.2d 283 (5th Cir. 1977). When one reads\nbetween the lines of these opinions, it is apparent that state legislatures have been reluctant in these inflationary\ntimes to spend sufficient tax dollars to bring conditions in outdated prisons up to minimally acceptable standards.\nThe crunch has become even more acute because of an increase in crime in recent years. At the same time that\n[7]\nfederal courts have been spelling out new constitutional minima based on this era's \"maturing sensitivity\"  as to\nprisoners' rights, the increased incidence of crime has resulted in more and more inmates being packed into\nobsolete prison facilities. Caught in the middle are state prison officials who must deal with the problems of\novercrowding on a daily basis. Quite apparent from the record here is the fact that the Warden and other officials\n\nat the MHC have been conscientiously doing a highly commendable job with the resources that the Maryland\nState Legislature has given them. But it is equally apparent that the State Legislature has not given them as\nmuch as they need or would like to have.\nIt must, of course, be recognized that state legislatures are subjected to great pressures from many sides in\nallocating public funds for purposes which will benefit citizens of the state. Certainly, it would be a legitimate\nlegislative prerogative to decide that more funds should be devoted to state programs designed to prevent crime\nthan to make convicted felons more comfortable in the penal institutions to which they have been sent. But the\nConstitution sets a floor below which no state may go in providing the basic necessities for its prisoners. However\nheinous the crimes they may have committed, the plaintiffs in this case are human beings possessing rights\nrecognized by the Constitution and by decisions of the Supreme Court. And there is no prisoners' lobby present\nin legislative halls to compete with powerful pressure groups seeking a share of the tax dollar. Again and again, it\nhas been the lower federal courts which have felt compelled to intervene to assure that state officials are\nrecognizing and implementing the basic constitutional rights of prisoners. This case is one of those in which a\nfederal court reluctantly feels compelled to intervene in state prison affairs.\nOvercrowding and double-celling\nFrom the totality of the evidence presented, this Court finds and concludes that the MHC is unconstitutionally\novercrowded. The unconstitutional conditions at the MHC, in this Court's opinion, are caused solely by the\ndefendants' practice of double-celling inmates in the main housing areas at the institution. Furthermore, for\nreasons discussed hereinafter, the SCA should be closed. When double-celling is discontinued and the SCA\nclosed, this Court is satisfied that the unconstitutional overcrowding at the MHC will be eliminated and that other\ndeficiencies described by witnesses in this case will no longer be of constitutional magnitude. Plaintiffs are\ntherefore entitled to an injunction ordering the discontinuance of double-celling and the closing of the SCA. They\nare not entitled to injunctive relief designed to improve other conditions at the MHC.\nAs a starting point for consideration of the claim of unconstitutional overcrowding pressed in this case, this Court\nwould note the age and architecture of the South and West Wings where all the double-celling occurs. The West\nWing was built about 100 years ago, when prisoners were confined to their cells for major portions of their\nperiods of confinement. Twentieth Century penology recognizes the psychological and physical harm caused by\n655 unremitting confinement. Although most prisoners *655 at the MHC are today free to move about outside their\ncells for large parts of the day, inmates not assigned a job nor enrolled in educational programs spend some\nsixteen hours a day in their cells. The South Wing was built fifty years ago, but its construction conformed to that\nof the West Wing. The cells in both wings were designed to house a single prisoner.\nOver the years, State officials have conscientiously attempted to improve the antiquated physical facilities which\nhoused the bulk of the prison population. Various physical improvements have been added from time to time, and\nnew programs and services have been provided to meet the needs of the inmates. Measurable progress had\nbeen made until suddenly, in the early and mid-1970's, the prison population in Maryland jumped dramatically. In\nthe five-year period between January 1, 1972 and December 31, 1976, the inmate population of the Division of\nCorrection increased by 62%. In 1976 alone, there was an increase of 16%, the population having jumped from\n[8]\n6950 to 8064, or over 1100 additional prisoners in a single year.  To permit the MHC to handle its share of this\nsudden increase, prison officials ordered the doubling up of inmates at the institution in single cells containing\nonly forty square feet. Much of the progress made in modernizing the antiquated facilities at the MHC to meet\ntoday's needs went down the drain because of this severe overcrowding.\nDefendants concede, as they must, that overcrowding exists at the MHC. Every witness so testified. With\nimprovements and additions, the MHC is designed to house 1100 inmates. Yet in March 1978, 1708 prisoners\nwere confined in the institution. Defendants argue that the overcrowding has not reached constitutional\nproportions. This Court must disagree.\nThe many federal cases which have considered the problem of overcrowded conditions at state institutions\nestablish no clearly delineated standards for determining at what point crowded prisons violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Certainly, convicted felons are not to be coddled and have no constitutional right to be housed in\nconditions suitable for a hotel or country club. See Pugh v. Locke, supra at 331. But it can hardly be gainsaid that\nat some point, the crowding of prisoners in outmoded facilities becomes incompatible with modern standards of\ndecency and results in punishment beyond the limits of the Eighth Amendment.\nThe evidence here discloses that overcrowding at the MHC has adversely affected prisoners confined in that\ninstitution in various ways. The witnesses described both direct adverse effects on the prisoners themselves and\nindirect effects resulting from the inability of the prison staff to handle the needs of an ever-expanding prison\npopulation. The noise level at the institution, particularly in the four-tiered South and West Wings, is excessive.\nExpert testimony in this case indicates that the psychological effects of overcrowding include increased stress,\nanxiety and fear. Serious incident reports of violence and other major disciplinary infractions increased at the\nMHC from 231 in 1976 to 295 in 1977. There were 53 instances of attempted suicide at the institution in 1977.\nThe SCA is almost always filled to capacity with prisoners suffering from psychological problems.\nExtensive idleness is another by-product of overcrowding. Work, school or other programs designed as\nconstructive outlets for inmates at the MHC were not intended to take care of a prison population of over 1700.\nOne of defendants' own experts acknowledged that a major problem confronting the MHC was the enforced\nidleness of hundreds of prisoners who could be seen milling about in the yard, cell halls and dormitories or who\nmerely remained in their cells during the day.\nConsidered separately, these deficiencies would not amount to a deprivation of constitutional magnitude. But\n656 weighed in *656 their totality, these conditions at the MHC, all of which are directly related to overcrowding, result\nin the deprivation by defendants of rights guaranteed to plaintiffs by the Eighth Amendment.\nThis Court more specifically concludes that double-celling at the MHC, under the circumstances disclosed by the\ntotality of the evidence in this case, is unconstitutional. The undesirability of double-celling is underscored by the\nexpert testimony in this case, including that of defendants' own witnesses. One of defendants' witnesses termed\ndouble-celling \"unfortunate\" and \"deplorable\"; another called it a \"bad practice\". The evidence discloses that\ndouble-celling was never contemplated when the two wings were built, the cells in question having been intended\nfor single occupancy when built fifty or one hundred years ago. Upper bunks were added when the recent crush\nof new prisoners required doubling up. Contemporary standards of human decency, see Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S.\n86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958), are offended by the practical necessities of living in such cramped\nquarters. When the inmate in the upper bunk is required to use the toilet facilities in the middle of the night, his\ncell mate lies in his bed, eighteen inches away. Minimum space to call one's own is a primary psychological\nnecessity. Battle v. Anderson, 564 F.2d 388, 395 (10th Cir. 1977).\nDouble-celling increases the risk of sexual attacks by one prisoner on another and decreases the ability of prison\nguards to protect younger and weaker inmates from such homosexual assaults. Some of the testimony in Withers\nv. Levine, 449 F.Supp. 473 (D.Md.1978), a case recently tried in this Court, was likewise made a part of the\nrecord in this case. That testimony graphically illustrates that a younger prisoner at the MHC is at the mercy of an\nolder and stronger cell mate when locked in a double cell at night. In a very recent opinion filed on April 21, 1978\nin the Withers case, Judge Young, in granting declaratory and injunctive relief, ordered state officials to\npromulgate and implement written procedures for the safe initial housing assignment of arriving inmates (Id. at\n478). Among the options which Judge Young directed officials of the MHC to consider was the single celling of\nmore incoming inmates.\nThe relief granted in this case will go beyond that ordered by Judge Young in Withers. The defendants will be\nrequired to discontinue double-celling for all inmates, both the newly arrived and those previously in custody. This\nCourt is satisfied that the elimination of this practice will, inter alia, reduce the threat of homosexual assault at the\nMHC and concomitantly the constant fear of such assault, which amounts to an undue burden placed upon\nprisoners at the institution. See Woodhous v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 487 F.2d 889, 890 (4th Cir. 1973); Penn\nv. Oliver, 351 F.Supp. 1292, 1294 (E.D.Va. 1972).\nApproximately 960 inmates at the MHC are double-celled. Reducing the inmate population by eliminating double-\ncelling will achieve the following beneficial results:\n\n(1) Idleness will be decreased. A larger percentage of the prison population will be able to engage in educational,\nvocational and other constructive outlets.\n(2) Athletic, recreational and hygienic facilities will become more readily available to inmates. If double-celling is\neliminated in the West Wing, the present ratio of twenty-four men per showerhead will be reduced to fourteen\nmen per shower head, a much more acceptable ratio.\n(3) Excessive noise levels will be reduced.\n(4) The ratio of prison staff to number of inmates will be increased. Better security will be provided by prison\nguards, who will be better able to control assaults, misbehavior and the distribution of contraband. Prisoners will\nenjoy increased access to counselors, and classification procedures should improve with fewer inmates assigned\nto classification officers.\n(5) The number of sittings for meals will be reduced from three per meal to two per meal. At the present time,\n657 there are nine servings of meals every day. The elimination *657 of double-celling will reduce this number to six.\nMore time can then be devoted to food preparation and to sanitation in the kitchen and dining area. Fewer sittings\nwill decrease security problems when inmates are going back and forth to their meals.\nIn claiming that double-celling is constitutionally permissible in this case, defendants rely on Hite v. Leeke, supra.\nSee also Crowe v. Leeke, 540 F.2d 740 (4th Cir. 1976). In Hite, the Fourth Circuit held that the dual assignment of\ntwo prisoners to a room sixty-five feet square was not per se unconstitutional. But Hite is not controlling here,\nbecause of the markedly different facts involved in that case. Plaintiff there had challenged conditions in a new\nSouth Carolina correctional institution, completed in 1975 at a cost of approximately $12 million. The Court was\ncareful to point out in Hite that the prisoners in that institution enjoyed a wide freedom of movement and that the\nalleged overcrowding was not part of larger problems which might have given rise to what has been described as\nthe \"totality of conditions\" approach. 564 F.2d at 673.\nIn this case, portions of the institution are 100 years old, and the cell area involved is only forty square feet.\nFurthermore, this Court has employed the \"totality of conditions\" approach in finding unconstitutional\novercrowding in this case. Considering the double-celling challenged in this case in the light of all the other\nexisting conditions at the MHC, this Court is satisfied that Hite v. Leeke does not require a different result. The\nother deficiencies described in this opinion and caused by unconstitutional overcrowding at the MHC were not\nfound to be present in the Hite case.\nOn the record here, this Court concludes that discontinuation of the practice of double-celling at the MHC will\neliminate the unconstitutional overcrowding that now exists at that institution. Not only will be number of inmates\nbe reduced, but the totality of other conditions will also be thereby improved to the extent that confinement in the\nMHC will no longer be constitutionally offensive.\nThe Special Confinement Area\nThe Special Confinement Area (the \"SCA\") is designed to house inmates who have psychological or psychiatric\nproblems. Conditions of confinement are much more onerous here than anywhere else in the institution, except\nfor the punitive segregation area. However, inmates are placed in punitive segregation as punishment; those in\nthe SCA are not. Inmates are confined in punitive segregation for only short periods of time, while those in the\n[9]\nSCA stay, on the average, six to eight months and even longer.  There is no hot water in the cells, and many\ncells contain no beds or toilets. Only one shower exists for forty-nine prisoners. Inmates are confined in these\ncells for twenty-three hours a day and fed in their cells. Only one correctional officer is assigned to the entire\narea, and he has the responsibility for security, supervision and feeding of all forty-nine inmates.\nOn the record here, this Court concludes that conditions in the SCA, in their totality, do not meet constitutional\nstandards and that the SCA should be discontinued as soon as arrangements can be made to transfer the\ninmates elsewhere. Many of the persons confined in these cells are concededly psychotic, but are housed at the\nMHC because State mental institutions will not accept them. However, no psychiatric treatment is afforded these\n\nmentally ill prisoners; they are merely warehoused in the SCA. See Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir.\n1977); McCray v. Burrell, 516 F.2d 357, 367-69 (4th Cir. 1975) (en banc), cert. dismissed,426 U.S. 471, 96 S.Ct.\n2640, 48 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976). Others who are not psychotic but who have emotional problems are confined in the\n658 SCA, not as punishment but because of aberrant behavior. Yet these individuals are punished much more *658\nseverely by being confined in the SCA than are those confined in the administrative segregation area, even\nthough the latter have intentionally broken prison rules.\nThe actively psychotic prisoners and those others who need immediate treatment should be removed from the\nMHC and transferred to an appropriate State mental institution. The Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, which is\nunder the jurisdiction of the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, is specifically designed for the\nhospitalization of inmates of State penal institutions who become mentally ill and require such hospitalization. \nSee Maryland Manual, 1977-1978, p. 168. If institutions under the jurisdiction of that Department refuse to accept\nthese prisoners, this Court is prepared to join that State agency as a defendant in this case and order the\ntransfer. Others should be transferred to the administrative segregation area, if they are not mentally ill and if,\nafter adjustment hearings, it is found that their behavior has resulted in a violation of prison rules. See Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); Bundy v. Cannon, 328 F.Supp. 165 (D.Md.1971)\n.\nThe dormitories\nAlthough this Court is satisfied that double-celling as it exists in the MHC is unconstitutional, plaintiffs have not\nmet their burden of proving that the number of inmates housed in each of the dormitories should be reduced. C\nand D Dormitories house eighty-six and eighty-eight inmates respectively, while H, I and J Dormitories, which are\n[10]\nmuch larger in area, house approximately 106 each.  Each of the dormitories provides approximately fifty-five\nsquare feet per inmate bed space and eighty square feet per inmate, including recreation area. In addition, there\nare the adjacent toilet and shower areas, which provide even more space for the inmates confined in the\ndormitories. By way of contrast, the forty square foot double cells include that space occupied by toilets.\nThe testimony and the Court's inspection of these areas indicate that the degree of crowding in the dormitories is\nnowhere near as severe as in the institution's forty square foot cells which are occupied by two inmates. The\ndormitories themselves are kept reasonably clean, and sanitation in the shower and toilet areas is adequate.\nAlthough more space might be desirable, the dormitories meet constitutional requirements, and this Court will not\norder a reduction in the number of prisoners confined in any of the MHC's dormitories.\nOther conditions\nPlaintiffs also ask this Court to intervene in the management of the MHC in other areas and to require the\ndefendants to correct many other alleged deficiencies. But this Court is satisfied that once the overcrowded\nconditions at the MHC are corrected by the elimination of double-celling, these other inadequacies will not require\nthe intervention of this Court. Indeed, in and of themselves, these other conditions and programs are not\nconstitutionally deficient. It is only when they are considered in their totality together with the double-celling that\nexists throughout the institution that this Court finds and concludes that overcrowding at the MHC fails to meet\nconstitutional standards.\nIn Newman v. State of Alabama, supra, cited with approval by the Fourth Circuit in Hite v. Leeke, supra at 672,\nand more recently by the Fourth Circuit in Bolding v. Holshouser, 575 F.2d 461 (4th Cir. 1978), the Fifth Circuit\nsaid the following (at page 291):\nIf the State furnishes its prisoners with reasonably adequate food, clothing, shelter, sanitation,\nmedical care and personal safety, so as to avoid the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment,\nthat ends its obligations under Amendment Eight.\nWhat the State of Maryland furnishes its prisoners in this regard at the MHC, if considered separately and without\n659 *659 relation to the overcrowded conditions at the institution, is reasonably adequate. Specifically, the food\n\nprovided is sufficiently nutritious and served in sufficient quantities to be constitutionally adequate. Home-cooked\nmeals served in a quiet atmosphere are hardly provided but rather typical institutional food for 500 persons at\neach sitting. The witnesses who testified concerning the cleanliness of the kitchen areas, the use of outmoded\nequipment and utensils and the temperature of the food at the time it was served were more concerned with ideal\ninstitutional practices rather than with constitutional minima, which are the only concern of this Court.\nAdequate heat, light and ventilation are likewise provided at the MHC. Sanitation and rodent control are not\nconstitutionally offensive and substandard. The recreational and athletic facilities are adequate. Staffing at the\nMHC is presently sufficient to meet the basic needs of the prison population and will be even more adequate\nwhen overcrowded conditions are eliminated. Classification and parole and release procedures also meet\nconstitutional standards. Much of the testimony presented by plaintiffs' experts was devoted to minute and trivial\ndetails, including, for example, the wattage of electric light bulbs in cells and the precise temperature of the hot\nfood served to inmates during meals. However undesirable the described deficiencies might be, they hardly\namount to abusive practices which violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\nMedical care and psychological services (other than confinement in the SCA) are likewise sufficient. The new\nhospital and the manner in which it is manned by doctors and nurses adequately meet constitutional standards.\nThere are two doctors on the premises twenty hours per week per doctor, and the institution employs eleven\nregistered nurses. The physical facilities are modern and well suited to provide ambulatory and infirmary care for\ninmates. Emergency cases are taken by ambulance to the University Hospital in Baltimore. Although\nimprovements in the staffing and equipping of the hospital would be desirable, as would a reorganization of the\nmedical records system, these deficiencies are not of constitutional magnitude. Much of the evidence presented\nwas directed to the fact that on too many occasions rather than on two few inmates were taken to the University\nHospital when the treatment sought did not require hospitalization. Concededly, when inmates are received at the\nHospital, the treatment they then receive meets constitutional standards.\nThe Supreme Court has held that where medical care in a state penal institutional is challenged, liability under\nthe Eighth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 will arise only on proof of deliberate indifference by state officials to\nprisoners' serious medical needs. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). The\nevidence in this case falls far short of meeting this standard. Proof of isolated instances when a prisoner died in\nan ambulance or shortly after reaching the University Hospital hardly amounts to deliberate indifference on the\npart of the defendants. Most of these incidents involved cardiac patients, and the proof does not indicate that\ntheir lives would have been saved had more sophisticated measures been taken. The evidence here is not\nsufficient for the entry of an injunction which would require defendants to provide a fully equipped and staffed\nhospital to take care of any and all medical contingencies.\nIn the visitors' area, the elimination of overcrowding will correct existing deficiencies. Furthermore, plans are\nunder way at the present time to move the visitors' area to another location to provide more room for both\ninmates and their visitors. These changes are expected to be completed in the very near future and will make the\nvisiting area more than adequate to meet constitutional requirements.\nEliminating overcrowding will also make educational and vocational programs available for more of the inmate\npopulation. The expert witnesses in this case found little fault with the educational programs offered and with the\n660 opportunities afforded inmates *660 for working at different jobs. There is at present impartial access for these\nvarious rehabilitative programs. The problem that now exists is that present facilities do not permit a very large\npercentage of inmates either to go to school or to engage in vocational programs. Reduction of the prison\npopulation will correct these deficiencies and eliminate much of the present idleness at the MHC, with expected\nimprovements in morale and disciplinary problems.\nPlaintiffs have further argued in this case that the rehabilitative programs and services of the MHC, when\nconsidered in their entirety, fail to meet constitutional requirements. But as noted, the standard to be applied here\nis \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment. When such a standard has been applied in\ncases involving alleged deficiencies in rehabilitative programs, courts have consistently held that a prisoner has\nno constitutionally protected right to rehabilitation. See Newman v. State of Alabama, supra at 291; Holt v. Sarver,\n309 F.Supp. 362, 379 (E.D. Ark.1970),aff'd,442 F.2d 304 (8th Cir. 1971); Lunsford v. Reynolds, 376 F.Supp. 526,\n528 (W.D.Va.1974); and United States v. Wyandotte County, 343 F.Supp. 1189, 1202 (D.Kan.1972),rev'd on\n\nother grounds,480 F.2d 969 (10th Cir.),cert. denied,414 U.S. 1068, 94 S.Ct. 577, 38 L.Ed.2d 473 (1973). In \nNewman v. State of Alabama, the Fifth Circuit specifically held that the failure of prison authorities to provide a\n[11]\nrehabilitation program did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. 559 F.2d at 291.  What penological\nexperts, or even this Court, might feel to be highly desirable is not the standard to be applied in a case brought\nunder the Eight Amendment.\nPlaintiffs have also asked this Court to order the closing of the punitive segregation area. However, the evidence\nindicates that this area is used very infrequently. Furthermore, inmates are confined in these cells for only a short\nperiod of time, no more than four or five hours as a cooling-off period for a prisoner who has lost control of\nhimself and must be isolated until he calms down. Indeed, none of the experts who visited the MHC found a\nsingle inmate confined in the punitive segregation area at the time of his visit, nor did the Court when it toured the\ninstitution on March 17, 1978. Segregated or solitary confinement does not in itself violate the Constitution, and\nmay be appropriately employed for short periods of time to control recalcitrant prisoners. Sweet v. South Carolina\nDepartment of Corrections, supra at 858, n. 1; Collins v. Schoonfield, 363 F.Supp. 1152, 1166-68 (D.Md.1973). In\nthis case, the evidence discloses that conditions in the punitive segregation cells at the MHC would not meet\nconstitutional minima if inmates were confined there for extended periods of time. However, these conditions are\nconstitutionally permissible for short periods of confinement, and the cells in question are used in this manner by\nprison officials at the MHC.\nThe evidence here likewise does not support a constitutional challenge to conditions of administrative\nsegregation at the MHC. Indeed, in many ways, inmates in administrative segregation, who are single-celled,\nendure less onerous conditions than those in the general population who are double-celled. Moreover, the proof\nin this case has not shown that disciplinary procedures at the MHC do not meet the requirements of Bundy v.\nCannon, supra.\nIn support of their contentions in this case, plaintiffs rely on a number of different publications issued by the\n661 American Correctional Association (the \"ACA\") and other similar organizations.[12] Plaintiffs *661 point out that\nmany of the standards set forth in those publications have not been met by the MHC. As sensible and desirable\nas are the many suggestions of these organizations, they do not amount to constitutional minima. The exhibits in\nquestion are undoubtedly relevant to the constitutional issues in this case, and are entitled to different degrees of\nweight, depending upon the extent of the difference between conditions at the MHC and the suggested standard.\nHowever, in this case, the issue is whether particular conditions at the MHC constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth Amendment, not whether they meet standards adopted by a group of penologists or\nother experts in the field. A federal judge should not exercise his judicial powers and intervene in the operation of\nstate prisons for the attainment of what the judge \"might like to see accomplished in the way of ideal prison\nconditions.\" Newman v. State of Alabama, supra at 287; cited with approval in Hite v. Leeke, supra at 672, and in \nBolding v. Holshouser, supra. In particular, this Court does not conclude that confinement of a single inmate in a\nforty square foot cell at the MHC is unconstitutional, even though the ACA recommends sixty square feet of\nspace for each inmate in a single cell.\nIn sum, this Court is satisfied that other conditions at the MHC will satisfy constitutional standards once\novercrowding is eliminated.\nRelief\nThe final question presented in this case concerns the type of injunctive relief to be ordered by this Court to\ncorrect the constitutional deficiencies found to exist at the MHC. No ready solution to this complex problem\nexists. On the one hand, this Court is satisfied that the practice of double-celling and the overcrowded conditions\nat the MHC must cease as soon as the changes can reasonably be accomplished. On the other hand, it must be\nrecognized that the public is entitled to be protected from the premature release of convicted felons. These two\ninconsistent objectives meet head on in this case. Quite obviously, this Court cannot order the overnight\nreduction of the institution's prison population by hundreds of inmates, nor require that the SCA be closed\ntomorrow. Yet every day that overcrowding continues and the SCA remains open, the plaintiffs and their class will\nbe enduring punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\n\nRecognizing that overcrowding and other deficient conditions exist in its institutions, Maryland correctional\nofficials have in good faith prepared plans for modernizing state prison facilities, known as the Maryland Master\nPlan, Phases I and II. These Plans provide, inter alia, for the construction within the next four years of a new\nreception center, a new medium security prison and other facilities designed to reduce overcrowding in and\nmodernize Maryland penal institutions. But future implementation of defendants' Master Plans will not be enough\nto meet the needs of plaintiffs and their class. Although large increases in the number of prison beds available in\nState prisons have been projected by Maryland correctional officials and some of the construction is nearing\ncompletion, it will not be until 1982 that all the new facilities are scheduled for completion. But plaintiffs and the\nmembers of their class cannot wait for another four years. Reduction of overcrowding at the MHC must start at\nonce and must be accomplished in a matter of months, not years.\nNo damages have been claimed by the plaintiffs in this case, and the decree to be entered by the Court should\ntherefore provide only for injunctive and declaratory relief. Had plaintiffs sought damages here, such a recovery\nwould have been denied. The evidence clearly establishes that the actions challenged in this case were taken by\ndefendants in the good-faith fulfillment of their responsibilities and within the bounds of reason under all the\ncircumstances. Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 321, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975). The facts here\nindicate that the constitutional principles involved had not been so clearly established at the time of infringement\n662 that *662 the defendants could be charged with knowledge that their conduct was a violation of the constitutional\nrights of plaintiffs and the members of their class. Accordingly, on the present record, the defendants are immune\nfrom liability for damages under ยง 1983. Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. 555, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24\n(1978).\nCounsel should meet promptly and undertake to devise a plan for accomplishing at an early date the objectives\nwhich this Court has found are constitutionally required. Such a plan should provide for the reduction in stages of\nthe prison population of the MHC. Plaintiffs have specifically requested that this Court place a top limit of 912 as\nthe number of inmates who can be constitutionally confined in the MHC. No such rigid standard will be\nincorporated in the final decree. So long as double-celling is eliminated and the prison population reduced by a\nnumber of inmates equal to the number of double cells now existing, unconstitutional overcrowding will have\nbeen eliminated at the MHC.\nThis Court would note that a Memorandum and Decree was entered by Judge Kaufman on November 23, 1977\nin Duvall v. Lee, Civil No. K-76-1255, a pending case involving overcrowding at the Baltimore City Jail. Pursuant\nto the Partial Consent Decree approved in that case, overcrowding at the Baltimore City Jail is being reduced in\nstages under an agreed timetable. However, inmates have been transferred from the City Jail to new facilities\nwhich may likewise have to be used to reduce overcrowding at the MHC (and also at the Maryland Penitentiary).\n[13]\n Quite obviously, overcrowding in Maryland prisons is a State-wide problem. Resolution of the problem\ndemands a coordinated approach by counsel in all three of the cases now pending in this Court.\nIn devising a plan for correcting unconstitutional conditions at the MHC, counsel in this case should consider the\nmeasures agreed upon in the Baltimore City Jail case, as well as suggestions made herein by this Court.\nWhatever is eventually done, it is obvious that immediate additional funding for various state agencies will be\nrequired to reduce the population at the MHC to constitutionally permissible limits as promptly as possible. In\nparticular, counsel should consider the following: the transfer of psychotic and mentally ill inmates to State mental\nhospitals; improvements to the SCA to permit the housing of general population inmates there on a single-celled\nbasis; the reclassification of inmates in the MHC and, where warranted, the transfer of inmates to half-way\nhouses, community treatment centers, county jails, correctional camps and minimum security institutions; where\nwarranted, acceleration of the release of inmates on parole, work-release or otherwise; the hiring of additional\npersonnel to screen and reclassify prisoners for transfer to other institutions, for parole or for release; the hiring of\nadditional personnel by the Maryland Parole Commission to expedite the holding of parole hearings; the\nacceleration of planned construction programs to make new facilities available at the earliest possible date; and\nthe fixing of a cut-off date for the acceptance of new prisoners at the MHC. A decision concerning the alternatives\nto be selected for accomplishing the objectives outlined should be made in the first instance by responsible state\nofficials and, if reasonable, should be approved by counsel for the plaintiffs.\n\nWhen counsel have agreed upon an appropriate plan, it should be submitted to the Court for consideration and\napproval. A conference with counsel will be scheduled within thirty days. If no agreement can be reached as to\nthe measures to be adopted and the time for their implementation, this Court will itself determine the injunctive\n663 and declaratory relief to be entered, including, as a last resort, the drastic and unwanted *663 measure of\n[14]\nordering the release of certain prisoners.\nThe Court would like to thank all counsel for their courtesy and cooperation throughout these proceedings and for\nthe competent manner in which this case was presented.\n[1] All of these suits were assigned to the undersigned Judge. Other actions, similarly challenging conditions at\nthe Maryland Penitentiary, a maximum-security institution, were assigned to Judge Blair.\n[2] Civil No. H-77-113 is a suit under ยง 1983, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. Civil No. H-77-1460 is a\nhabeas corpus action in which petitioner is seeking his release from custody because of the alleged\novercrowding. The third consolidated case, Civil No. H-77-1459, has been dismissed at the request of the\nplaintiff.\n[3] A formal notice listing the issues in the case and signed by counsel for the plaintiffs was posted at the MHC.\nThe names and addresses of counsel were provided in the notice, and inmates desiring to confer about the\nissues were invited to contact the attorneys named.\n[4] The same experts testified concerning conditions at both the MHC and the Maryland Penitentiary. Since there\nwas some overlapping of the evidence and the arguments, the two Judges to whom the two consolidated cases\nhad been assigned sat together for most of the five-day trial. However, the record in the two consolidated cases\nhas been kept separate, and nothing contained in this Opinion is intended to be a finding or conclusion\nconcerning conditions at the Maryland Penitentiary.\n[5] This tour took place on Friday, March 17, 1978, three days before the trial commenced, and lasted some 2ยฝ\nhours.\n[6] The rated capacity of the institution under American Correctional Association standards is 1038.\n[7]Sostre v. McGinnis, supra at 190; Collins v. Schoonfield, supra at 1156.\n[8] With these additional prisoners being crammed into existing State institutions, it is not surprising that in 1977\nthis Court was flooded with suits filed by State prisoners challenging as unconstitutional overcrowded conditions\nat various Maryland prisons.\n[9] The record indicates that the SCA is usually fully occupied, up to its limit of forty-nine inmates.\n[10] Conditions in H-Annex, which houses minimum security inmates, are obviously superior to those elsewhere\nin the institution and clearly meet constitutional requirements.\n[11] In both Hite v. Leeke, supra, and Bolding v. Holshouser, supra, the Fourth Circuit cited the Newman decision\nwith approval.\n[12] Included are the ACA's Manual of Correctional Standards (1966 Ed.); the ACA's Manual of Standards for\nAdult Correctional Institutions (1977 Ed.); Standards for Health Services in Correctional Institutions (1976 Ed.) of\nthe American Public Health Association; and Report of the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Standards\nand Goals (1973 Ed.).\n[13] In an opinion filed today, Judge Blair has found that overcrowding also exists at the Maryland Penitentiary.\nThe undersigned Judge has had an opportunity to review that opinion and would agree completely with the\nconclusions reached therein by Judge Blair.\n[14] A ruling is reserved at this time on plaintiffs' application for an award of attorney's fees. See Finney v. Hutto,\n548 F.2d 740 (8th Cir. 1977),cert. granted, 434 U.S. 901, 98 S.Ct. 295, 54 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977).\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

TINNEY, et al.,  )\nDefendants.  )\n_  )\nStipulated Agreement\nIntroduction\nOn February 18, 1983 a Stipulation in this action was entered\ninto by the parties and approved  on June 3, 1983 by this Court.\nThis 1983 Stipulation was entered into to provide defendants with\ninterim  mechanisms  for  addressing  overcrowding  at  the  Maryland\nHouse  of  Correction  in Jessup, Maryland  (hereinafter  MHC) , and\nthe  Maryland  Correctional  Institution  in  Hagerstown,  Maryland\n(hereinafter MCI-H) without  the pressure of strict limits on the\npopulation numbers and types of housing facilities imposed by the\nCourt in 450 F. Supp. 648  (D. Md. 1978) and 479 F. Supp. 569 (D.\nMd. 1979).\nโ^~**&  -^\nOCT  5 1987\nAT BALTIMORf\nCLERK U.S.OISTRICTCOURT\nBY ^'STWCTOfMARO\n\nThe 1983 Stipulation  requires defendants  to ensure that the\ninstitutions  meet  certain  specified  criteria  while  utilizing\ninterim mechanisms  for housing  prisoners at MCI-H and MHC.  The\npresent  conditions  in  these  institutions  and  defendants'\npopulation  requirements  since  the  1983 Stipulation  was  entered\ninto, however, evidence a need to modify the 1983 Stipulation.\nAfter evaluating  the nature of plaintiffs' confinement since\n1983,  plaintif-fs' counsel  filed  an Amended  Motion  for  Further\nRelief  and Modification  of  the June  3,  1983 Stipulation.  The\nplaintiffs and defendants desire to resolve the issues addressed\nby plaintiffs  in their Amended Motion without the time, expense\nand uncertainty of contested ligitation.\nThe defendants by entering  into this agreement, however, do\nnot  admit  that  any  acts  complained  of  in Plaintiffs'  Amended\nMotion  for Further  Relief  and Modification  of  the June 3, 1983\nStipulation  constitute  violations  of  that  Stipulation  or  the\nUnited  States  Constitution.  Likewise,  by  entering  into  this\nAgreement,  members  of  the  plaintiff  class  are  not  waiving  any\nrights  to pursue  individual  claims  for monetary  relief  arising\nout of  the conditions  this Stipulated  Agreement  is designed  to\ncorrect.\nPlaintiffs and defendants, therefore, have voluntarily agreed\nto  the  provisions  of  this Stipulated  Agreement, which  replaces\nthe June 3, 1983 Stipulation.  This Stipulated  Agreement  shall\nbecome effective on the date it is approved by the Court.\nThe parties do hereby stipulate and agree that the defendants\nshall operate  these  facilities  in conformity with  the standards\n-2-\n\ndeveloped  by  the Department  of  Public  Safety  and  Correctional\nServices' Commission on Correctional Standards.  The parties do\nfurther stipulate and agree as follows:\n!โข  Compliance Monitoring\nA.  For  a period  of  three years  following  approval of\nthis Stipulated Agreement by the Court, defendants shall\nsubmit monthly  reports to the plaintiffs and  the Court\ndescribing compliance with the terms of this Stipulated\nAgreement.  The format of the report shall be developed\nby  the  plaintiffs  and  defendants  and  a copy  shall  be\nattached as an appendix to this agreement.\nB.  The  defendants  shall  submit  to  the  Court  for\napproval,  implementation  plans  developed  pursuant  to\nthis  Stipulated  Agreement  on  or  before,  the  date\nindicated  in the text of the agreement.  Where no date\nis indicated, the plan is due on or before November  1,\n1987.  The  plaintiffs  shall have  thirty  days  from  the\ndate  indicated  in  the  text  to  review  these  plans  and\nsubmit  any objections  to the Court.  Either  party may\nrequest a hearing on any objection to any portion of the\nplan.  Such  request  for hearing  must be made no later\nthan fifteen days after the date plaintiffs' objections\nare due to the Court.\nC.  All  plans  approved  by  the  Court  shall  become\nappendices  to this Stipulated Agreement.  Either  party\nmay request a modification to the plan so appended.  No\nmodification  shall  be  approved  which  changes  the\n-3-\n\nunderlying  purpose  of  this  Stipulated  Agreement,  to\neliminate  doublecelling  and  doublebunking  and  provide\nplaintiffs with constitutional living conditions at MCI-\nH and MHC.\nD.  Counsel  for  plaintiffs  shall, upon request  to the\ndefendants,  receive  any  documents,  not  otherwise\nprivileged  by the Federal Rules of Evidence, which may\ndemonstrate  compliance  or  lack  of  compliance  with  the'\nterms  of  this  Stipulated  Agreement.  Counsel  for\nplaintiffs shall have access to members of the plaintiff\nclass  at  reasonable  times  and  under  reasonable\ncircumstances.  Plaintiffs'  counsel,  including  any\nexperts  selected  by  them,  upon  reasonable  notice  to\ndefendants' counsel, shall have access to MCI-H and MHC\nfor  the  purpose  of  making  observations  concerning\ncompliance.\nE.  After  the expiration  of  the three years described\nin IA above, the Court shall hold a hearing to determine\nthe  need  for  continued  monitoring  of  this  Stipulated\nAgreement.\nII.  Population\nTo  meet  the  population  requirements  of  this  section,\ndefendants shall submit a plan to the Court by July 1, 1987,\nfor reduction of the populations in MCI-H and MHC.\n-4-\n\nA.

The  defendants  shall  discontinue\ndoublebunking,  with  the  exception  of  WPDC,  and\ndoublecelling  within  180  days  after  the  Eastern\nCorrectional  Institution, ECI, is open for reception of\nprisoners,  but  in  any  event,  no  later  than  March  1,\n1988.

Such  plan  shall  provide  each  prisoner  with  55\n-6-\n\nsquare  feet of  living  space exclusive of dayroom  space\nand bathroom  facilities.  No prisoners shall be housed\nin  these  areas,  at  this  time  the  basement  annexes  at\nMCI-H  and O-Dorm  at MHC, after January  1, 1988, until\nall renovations are completed.\nD.  In the event  of  a major  catatrophe, such  as, but\nnot limited  to, a fire or major disturbance, destroying\na  significant  portion  of the institutions, thus making\nsome,  if  not  all  of  the  living  areas  unusable,  the\ndefendants  may  temporarily  doublecell  or  doublebunk\nprisoners or house prisoners classified to lower custody\nin these institutions.

The\ncorrectional staff shall not have the discretion to\ndelete  any  prisoner  from  the  sick  call  list.  The\nsick call lists, sick call passes and logs shall be\nmaintained  for  the  duration  of  the  monitoring  of\nthis  agreement.  Sick  call  passes  shall  not  be\ndistributed by prisoners.\n(3)  A  determination  of  whether  a  prisoner  is  in\nneed of medical treatment  is made not on the basis\nof what he says on the sick call slip but on a face\nto face assessment by a health care professional.\n(4)  Prisoners  complaining  of  painful  dental\nconditions  are  evaluated  within  twenty-four  (24)\nhours  of  their  complaint  by  a  health  care\nprofessional.\nB.  Have  a  formalized  and  written  quality  assurance\nprogram which reviews all medical treatment.

Upon  approval  of  this  Stipulated  Agreement,\ndefendants shall provide all general population prisoners\nwith  at  least  five  hours  per  day  out-of-cell  time,\nexclusive of meal times.\nB.  In  order  to  allow  prisoners  to  constructively\nutilize this time and meet their needs as  identified  in\nthe  objective  classification  process,  defendants  shall\nevaluate  their  work,  educational,  vocational  and\nrecreational programs and submit a plan to the Court for\napproval  by January  1,  1988  for provision  of programs,\nincluding  library  services,  to  this  population.  In\nformulating  this  plan  the  defendants  shall  utilize\nthe  information  developed  through  the  classification\nprocess.  The objective  classification  process  utilized\nby  the  Division of  Correction is  for the  purpose  of\n-16-\n\ndetermining  the  custody  and  security  levels  of\nprisoners.  The needs discussed  in this paragraph with\nregard to work, educational, vocational and recreational\nprograms  will  be  determined  by  and  those  servces\nprovided  to  prisoners  through  the  Division  of\nCorrection's  multi-disciplinary  counseling  program\n(known as the Case Management Program).\nC.  Defendants shall provide at least one hour per day\nout-of-cell activity  to all prisoners in administrative\nand  disciplinary  segregation.2  This  out-of-cell\nactivity  shall  be  outdoors  at  least  one  day  per  week\nexcept  in  inclement  weather  for  prisoners  in\nadministrative segregation.\nD.

Prisoners  in  administrative  segregation  and\nprotective  custody  for  longer  than  thirty  (30)  days\nshall  have  access  to  educational  and  recreational\nThe parties are unable to agree on provision of outdoor and\nstructured in-cell activity to prisoners in disciplinary\nsegregation.  The terms of this agreement do not preclude\nplaintiffs from taking any legal action they deem necessary\nto attempt to obtain outdoor and structured in-cell activity\nfor prisoners in disciplinary segregation.\n-17-\n\nprograms.  Prisoners  in  administrative  segregation  and\nprotective  custody  shall  be  provided  with  the\noppportunity  for  at  least  three  (3)  hours  per  day\nstructured  in-cell  activity  which  can  include,  e.g.,\neducational  programming,  vocational  programming,  and\narts  and  crafts.\nVIII.  Access to Courts\nThe  defendants  agree  to  review  the legal  services\ncurrently  provided  by the Prisoner  Assistance  Project and\ndevelop  and implement  a plan  to eliminate  any delays in\nreceiving the necessary  legal assistance which persists for\nlonger than one week.\nIX.  The Court's Continuing Jurisdiction\nThe  Court  shall  retain  jurisdiction  of  the above-\ncaptioned cases and shall retain discretionary authority, subject\nto all applicable provisions of law concerning modification where\nnot  otherwise  modified  by this  Stipulation, to modify,  either\nprospectively or retrospectively, any provisions hereof.  Either\nparty may at any time apply to this Court for modification of any\nand  all  provisions  of  this  Stipulation,  upon  appropriate\nnotice.  Either  party may seek enforcement of the provisions of\nthis agreement by appropriate motion.  No modification shall be\ngranted  which changes the underlying  purpose of this Stipulated\nAgreement,  to  eliminate  doublecelling  and doublebunking and\nprovide plaintiffs with constitutional living conditions at MCI-H\nand MHC.\n-18-\n\nRichard  Kastendieck Adjoa'A.

WASHINGTON, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civil No. H-78-1730\nJAMES P. TINNEY, et al.,\nDefendants.\nSTIPULATION OF FACTS AND AGREED RESOLUTION\nThe parties are entering into this stipulation of facts and\nagreed resolution to correct violations of the Stipulated Agreement\nand  Supplemental  Stipulated  Agreement  entered  by  this  Court  on\nOctober 2, 1987 and February 19, 1988, respectively.  For purposes\nof this Stipulation defendants do not stipulate that any of the\nmatters  or  facts  set  forth herein  constitute violations  of any\nexisting orders of this Court nor constitute any unconstitutional\ncondition of confinement.\nJohnson v. Galley\nPC-MD-003-004\n\nHEALTH CARE\n1.  The  problems  in  the  health  care  delivery  system  are\nsummarized in the report of Dr. Charles Braslow, Attachment A.\n2.  Warden Waters at the Maryland Correctional  Institution\nis currently investigating complaints against a physician assistant\nmade by staff.\n3.  The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services\n(hereinafter Department) is currently involved in negotiations to\nincrease the health care staff.\nNUTRITION\n1.  The problems identified by plaintiffs' nutrition expert\nare incorporated in her reports, Attachment B.\n2.  The food service supervisor, will provide plaintiffs with\nthe last 60-day menus for evaluation.\n3.  The Food Service facility for MCI-H is currently under\nconstruction.  It is difficult to evaluate its adequacy due to this\nstatus.\n4.  There has been a great deal of improvement  in the MHC\nFood Service.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS\n1.  Active  rodent  infestation  was  found  by  Ted  Gordon,\nplaintiffs1 environmental health expert, at MCI-H.\n2.  Current maintenance staff at both facilities are unable\nto keep up with maintenance needs of the facilities.\n3.  There  is  a  need  for  more  maintenance  staff.  The\ndepartment  is  not  complying  with  its  own  standard  of  one\n\nmaintenance person per 17,000 square feet.  There is currently one\nmaintenance person for approximately 22,000 square feet.\n4.  The parties agree that they need to develop a standard\nfor environmental conditions and uniform inspection formats.  The\nstate inspector often gives the institutions high marks although\nplaintiffs' expert finds serious problems.\n5.  Staff  should  be  trained  to  do  the  inspections  on  a\nregular basis, using a checklist developed by them reflecting the\nagreement on standards.\n6.  Maintenance has become a priority with the department.\nA new department head of maintenance was hired, Mr. Chandler, who\nwill report directly to the deputy commissioner.\n7.  The new program includes adding 60 new positions for the\nentire system and regionalizing maintenance services.\n8.  The  sewage  and  water  systems  at  MHC  are  inadequate.\nThese  systems  will  be  remodeled  with  the  renovations  but  the\nDepartment does not have the schedule.\n9.  The preventive maintenance program is not operative at\neither facility.  If it had been operating, millions of dollars in\nexpenditures could have been avoided.\nFIRE SAFETY\n1.  Both  facilities have  significant  fire safety  problems\nthat include:\na.  Numerous fire alarms and smoke detectors that were\npartially or totally inoperable;\nb.  Inadequate evacuation plans;\nc.  Staff untrained in fire safety procedures.\n\n2.  There was a fire in January 1990 on the West Wing of MHC\nand  none  of  the  security  staff  knew  evacuation  procedures.\nSimilarly, staff questioned by Mr. Gordon at MCI-H were unfamiliar\nwith evacuation and fire suppression procedures.\n3.  The second means of egress for the basement annexes are\nunacceptable to plaintiffs.  They are too small  (17\" x 24\") and\nupon  inspection  were  either  blocked  by  furniture  or  required\ntravelling through a shower area and over a radiator.\n4.  No  staff are trained  to repair  fire alarms and  smoke\ndetectors.\n5.  There is a need for routine maintenance and repair of the\nfire alarm system if it is to operate in an emergency.\n6.  A service contract should be entered into for the repair\nand regular maintenance of the fire alarm system.\nPOPULATION\n1.  The department is developing plans to decrease crowding\nsystemwide,  including  electronic  monitoring,  enhancement  of\nevaluation of prisoners to identify those who may be eligible for\nintensive  parole/probation  supervision;  increasing  good  conduct\ncredits prisoners can earn by developing education programs for\nidle prisoners; increasing the number of parole hearing officers;\nexpediting MAP contracts.\n2.  The department does not plan to increase the populations\nat these institutions except through construction of new facilities\non the grounds of these institutions.\n\nCONCLUSION\nConditions are at a critical level at both institutions.\nRESOLUTION\n1.  Plaintiffs experts will team with the department's staff\nto  develop  specific  plans  to  come  into  compliance  with  the\nstipulated agreements.\n2.  Defendants  will  not  increase  the  population  at\neither facility pending coming into compliance with the stipulated\nagreements,  except  in  an  emergency  and  after  notification  of\nplaintiffs' attorney.\nRespectfully submitted,\nQ.\nQ  y\nEmory A.

BRASLOW, M.D.\nJANUARY, 1990\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn January 1990 I visited the Maryland Correctional Institu-\ntion  (MCI-H), Hagerstown, and the Maryland House of Correc-\ntion  (MHC), Jessup, on behalf of the ACLU National Prison\nProject in order to evaluate the provision of health ser-\nvices.  The assessment of the health care services consisted\nof interviews with the facility medical staff, represent-\natives of the health services contractor at each facility\n(Correctional Medical Services  (CMS)), and inmates; and a\nreview of medical records of inmates at both facilities.\n\nGENERAL FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nHAGERSTOWN  (MCI-HI\nThe MCI-Hagerstown facility was inspected on January 5, 1990.\nDiscussions were held with Ms. Martin, facility CMS adminis-\ntrator, and several inmates at the facility.\nMEDICAL FINDINGS\n1.  Physician hours for clinical medical services amount to\n250 hours/month or about 12 hours/weekday for the entire\nHagerstown complex, with a total population of 4900\ninmates  (MCI-H+MCTC+RCI)โข  Physician assistant coverage\namounts to less than one PA per shift at MCI-H since all\nHagerstown facilities must be covered.  A full-time phy-\nsician and full-time PA should be assigned to MCI-H alone\nto provide weekday clinical services.\n2.  The system of approval for surgical procedures results in\ndisapproval of some procedures which are medically indi-\ncated.  Example:  Larry Morgan #166540 - Has inguinal\nhernia.  Physician review note 12/13/89 states \"The fact\nof a complaint of hernia does not require that it be\nscheduled for surgery.\"  In fact, hernias should be sur-\ngically repaired due to the possibility of future compli-\ncations.\n3.  Medical management of some cases is inadequate.  Example:\nHoward Stokes #168502 - History of peptic ulcer treated\nin MCI-H infirmary in 9/89  for gastrointestinal bleeding\nresulting in fall in blood count from 47% to 28%.\n\nTreated with antacids and discharged.  Should have\nreceived workup for bleeding, including GI series and\nbarium enema.\n4.  No written policy exists regarding criteria for treatment\nof HIV+ patients with AZT or PCP prophylaxis.  Such poli-\ncies should be developed and should recommend utilization\nof AZT for asymptomatic patients with T4 cell counts of\nless than 500.  Implementation of such a policy will\nrequire availability of voluntary, confidential HIV test-\ning upon request by asymptomatic inmates.\n5.  While it is true that some inmate complaints are\nunfounded or unrealistic, I was struck by a pattern of\ncomplaints from inmates about the conduct of the Senior\nPhysician Assistant at MCI-H, who was variously described\nas \"belligerant\", \"disrespectful\", and prone to \"curse\nout\" inmates.  I suggest that the medical services\ncontractor investigate and monitor this situation.\n\nJESSUP  (mo\nThe facility was inspected on January 4, 1990.  Discussions\nwere held with the CMS site administrator, Mr. Linton, and\nthe Charge Nurse, Ms. Bingemer.  The population for the day\nwas 1369.\n1.  Need persists for a Registered Nurse in the Infirmary to\nmanage the difficult patients housed there and to provide\non-site supervision for the LPN.\n2.  No physician is assigned full-time at MHC.  Physician\nhours are divided among the regional Medical Director and\ntwo physicians who divide time among all the regional\nfacilities.  A full-time physician should be assigned\nsolely to MHC.\n3.  Segregation medical rounds do not occur on weekends.\n4.  Frequent delays in response to sick call requests result\nin waits of a week or longer.\n5.  The system for scheduling specialty clinics has improved\nwith the implementation of a computerized log.\n6.  Many inmate complaints indicated that the new system\nfor renewal of medical diets is cumbersome and frequently\nresults in delays of diet renewals.\n7.  Many inmates complained that there are frequent gaps\nin medication renewals which result in lack of medication\nfor several days between prescriptions.  The pharmacy\nsystem should be revised and monitored to eliminate such\ngaps.\n\n8.  Stock medications for common conditions such as colds\nare not maintained in the Dispensary area.  As a result,\nthese medications require a prescription to be sent to\nthe pharmacy and'are not available until after symptoms\nhave resolved.  These medications, including deconges-\ntants and antihistamines, should be kept on hand for\nacute administration.\n9.  There are no written protocols regarding HIV testing,\nAZT treatment, or PCP prophylaxis.  Such policies should\nbe developed to conform to current medical standards.\n10.  Medically indicated surgical procedures are delayed\nor denied due to inappropriate criteria for approval.\nExamples:\nBurton  (H dorm) - Large gall bladder stones.\nSurgery recommended by University of Maryland\nHospital.  Told by physician at MHC that an\nemergency situation must occur before he could\nhave the operation.  In fact, presence of gall\nstones is an indication for surgery.\nWilliam Gross 174639 - Multiple foot deformities.\nUtilization review at MHC noted \"Patient has\ninsurance coverage and is willing to use it for\nsurgery*\"  However, when it was discovered that\nthe patient's insurance did not cover this surgery,\nhe was referred to University of Maryland Hospital\nwho said the surgery would be deferred until the\npatient was released on parole.  Insurance and parole\nshould not be considerations in scheduling surgery.\n\n11.  Medical care reviewed in charts shows inadequacy in some\ninstances:\nGeorge Floyd #163736 - Admitted to Infirmary on\n1/2/90 for vomiting blood and dizziness.  Seen\nby MD on 1/3/90 but gastrointestinal bleeding\nproblem not addressed.  No laboratory studies\nordered to check blood count.  Check of stool and\nstomach contents ordered but no results on chart.\nDavid Robinson #193947 - Brought to dispensary on\n12/23/89 with severe, life-threatening asthma attack.\nChart states \"Will refer to PA/MD on call for further\nevaluation.  Call placed to Dr. Felix at 10:15 pm -\nno response. . . 1 am Dr. Francia here . . .1:30 am\nreferred to emergency room.\"  This patient could have\ndied between 10:15 pm and 1 am.  If there is no\non-site medical coverage at night, the on-call system\nmust be improved to assure immediate response to such\nlife-threatening emergencies.\nRichard Gross #196045 - Renal dialysis patient sent\nto University of Maryland Hospital on 12/25/89 for\na seizure.  No note on chart since then, no emergency\nroom report or recommendations and no follow-up.  All\nemergency referrals must be seen by medical staff on\nreturn to the facility to insure appropriate fol-\nlow-up.\nFrancis Harper #200445 - Seen 11/8/89 for complaint\nof \"Very severe pain and swelling in groin area.\"\n\nDiagnosis was inguinal hernia.  Medical recommend-\nation was sitz baths.  Should have been referred for\nsurgical evaluation.  Potential for severe complica-\ntions of hernia, such as strangulation.\n\nATTACHMENT B\n\nHGEMC -n ?\nSUMMARY SITE REPORT\nNOVEMBER 11, 19 89\nMaryland Correctional  Institution\nHagerstown, Maryland\nPrepared for\nNATIONAL PRISON PROJECT\nWASHINGTON, DC\nPrepared by\nJUDY F.

During the site visit, the  food preparation  facility at the\nCentral and RCI kitchens,  as well  as the  food  service and  food\nstorage areas  at MCI*3  main kitchen  were toured. Interviews  were\nconducted  with  inmates and staff as needed  to obtain  clarifications\nconcerning  components  of operations  and/or  to point out  problems\nidentified.  The  following  is a summary of  the major  findings and\nconclusions.\n1.  CENTRAL  KITCHEN\nUpon arrival  at the  Central Kitchen at about  9:20  am,  frozen\nhamburger  was out on the table.  This  item was on the? menu tor\nNovember  12,  1989. The  hamburger  had  not been thawed  in the\nreilr igerator .\nThe practice  of thawing  foods  at  room  temperature  must \"r โข\navoided.  It  is  also  inappropriate  to Isave  large  quantities\nof potentially hazardous  foods on tables  tor hours  while pre-\npreparation  activities  are being  completed. Foods can  saยฃei>\nbe thawed  in a thawing  cabinet, [which brings  the food  to 32ยฐF,\nor thawed  over a period  of  36 hours  in a refrigerated  storage\narea.  In any event, foods should  not be allowed  to reach the\ndanger  zone of  45-140 degrees.\n\n12/07'1989  09= -  wIC STATE HGENCY  20.  3 3539  P.06\nDry Storage\nThe following are findings in this area:\n1.)  Sugar and  salt were  stored in trash cans.  These units\nwere not lined and the lids and interior were soiled.\n2.)  Dried  yreen  peppers  were  stored  in  an  uncovered\ncontaj ner;\n3.)  3oap and  cleaning agents  were stored adjacent to foods,\nincluding open disinfectant agents;\n4).  Date stamps were not indicated on  all  the foods stored\nin the area  [ this is necessary to preserve the viability\nof the inventory and  to assure  that older  items in the\ninventory are used  first];\n5.)  Several  cans  of  kdle  greens  had burst open and hart\nbecome infested with worms;\n6.)  A significant number of bent cans of foods were observed;\nand/\n7.)  Water leakage  was noted  in the food storage area.  Syrup\nwas also dripping onto  the floor  in this  area from the\ncontainer.\nThe above  findinys present a hazard to nood wholesomeness a:._\nsafety.  Food storage  is a  critical safety  control point :n\nthe tood  cycle.  Some of  the above  risks may have occurred\nduring receipt  and  initial  storage of  the foods.  To avoid\nthese hazards,  standards must  be in place to avoid receiviaq\nunsatisfactory foods.  Poods should be  inspected upon receipt\nto assure  that standards  and specifications  are met.  Fund;\n\n12/07-'1969  d3-'  MIC STATE AGENCY 20.  3 3539  P.07\nshould  be properly packaged  to avoid  contaminations  from other\nfoodf< or  environmental  sources.  This  .is why all  ยฃoods should\nbe covered  In clean containers at all times.  Since cleansers,\ndisinfectants and  chemicals can  be mistaken  fox  foods, these\n3ubstan<-fยปs should  never  be, stored... in tjie same .area as the food\nsupply.  In  addition,  /roods  for dry storage  in particular\nshould  be date stamped  upon receipt and  the newer  foods stored\nfor  later  use.  Clear  policies  regarding  use of bent canned\ngoods  should  be  developed,  communicated  and  implemented.\nFinally, a  clean and dry environment  i3 essential  to maintain\nthe shelve  life and wholesomeness  of the foods.\nRefrigerators  and\nMoat, of the units were clean.  Improperly  wrapped and  covered\nfoods were  consistent  problems noted during  the visit.  For\nexample, steak3 were uncovered  in une  unit .and  hamburger  and\neggs  in  another  unit.  In t.ho freezer,  foods were  tightly\nโขjammed  into this unit and were  stored  in  a clutter  and  very\ndisorganized  manner.  The  hamburger  ir.  this  unit  was not\nwrapped  contributing  to lost ot nutrients  .and t'javor  at thยซ\nmeat.  One refrigerator  was quite  untidy  with  blood  on the\nCloor, ..-i's well as food  particles.\nFood  preparation\nFoods are prepared  in the central kitchen  for MCI and  for the\nHuV.s,  Many  of  the  menu  items  are  prepared  using  the\n\n7''1389  39: r  I.JIC STHTE HGENCV  231  3 33J3  P.08\nfood/chi]1  [I]  method  oยฃ  food  preparation,  including  such\nfoods an soups,  meat sauces and casseroles.  Other  itema, such\nas  fish and  vegetables  are  prepared  using  cook/satellite\npreparation  [cook/serve]  [2] technique.  AH  Dietary  Officers\nshould  be trained  in  the cook/chill  food preparation  method.\nAll  staff  should  understand  the  limitations of the system.\nFor example,  Officer Robert  Bathlow reported  that the  foods\nprepared  by  cook/chill  could  be held  under  refrigยซration  for\nup to 30 days, while Officer  Souders reported  that the  foods\ncould  be  held  for 72 hours.  Similar discrepancies were  noted\nconcerning  tha policy on the  use  of  bent  cans  of produce.\nOfficer  Bathlow  reported  that bent cants were used  if he found\nthat the  foods  [after  opening]  were  not  discolored.  He\nreported  that  about  50%  of all cans were  bent  [observation\nindicated  that about  30% of those  being used  during  the site\nvisit were  bent).  On the other, hand  Dietary Officer  Souders\nreported  that, bent cans of  items such an  fruit  were  not  used,\nbut  that;  items such as catsup were used.

C,  pursuant to the\nStipulated  Agreement  in Johnson  v. Galley/  et al.  The Maryland\nCorrectional  Institute  (MCI)  and  Maryland  House  of  Corrections\n[MHC] were toured on May 27, and June 10, 1989, respectively.  The\nfindings  summarized  in  the  following  sections  are  based  on\nobservations  during  the  site  visit  of  food  preparation,  food\nservice  and  food  handling  and  storage  practices.  Results  of\ninterviews  with  inmates  and  staff  are also considered as well as\nreview of other documents and materials.\nDuring the visit to MCI, three kitchen areas and their respective\nfood storage areas were inspected.  Food service facilities at the\nHuts were also inspected.  At MHC food service and food preparation\nwere  observed;  a  plate  waste  assessment  was  completed  and  food\nstorage facilities were inspected. Food service in the segregation\nunit was also observed  at MHC.  At both MCI and MHC, inmates on\nmedical diets were interviewed as well as  Officers responsible for\nsupervision  of  diets.  Inmates  receiving  the  regular menu  were\nalso interviewed.\nConclusions  are  based  on  the  level  of  adherence  to policies  and\nprocedures  stipulated  in the Maryland  House of Corrections: FooU\n\nService  Operations Manual. 198Q and to recognized standards in the\narea of food service and nutritional care.  The standards include\nthose  of  the  American  Correctional  Association  and  the  American\nPublic Health Association.\nPersonnel conferred with during the tour of MCI included the Deputy-\nWarden, Dietary Officers at  the RCI, Central  and Main Kitchens as\nwell as  the following.members of the Inmate Plaintiff Committee,\nMr. Baha Wali and Mr. Steven Johnson.  The  Warden, Deputy Warden\nand Correctional Dietary Officers were conferred with at MHC.\nMy  sincere  thanks  to  the  staffs  of  both  MCI  and MHC as well as\ninmates,  for  their  cooperation  during  the  site  visit  and  the\ncourtesies they extended.\nJudy F. Wilson, RD, MSPH\nNUTRITION CONSULTANT\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS\nThe  findings  enumerated  in  this  report  are  not meant  to  be  an\nexhaustive statement of conditions.  Rather, this Report provides a\nsummary of broad problem areas noted.  Modifications to this Report\nmay  be  made  upon  receipt  of  new  or  additional  information  or\nanalysis of additional documents.\nMajor  findings  and  conclusions  are  provided  for  MCI  and  MHC\nrespectively.  Findings  have  been  categorized  into  three  broad\nareas:  General, food storage and sanitation, and food preparation\nand  service.  General  recommendations  for enhancing  food  service\noperations at both facilities are also offered.\nI.  MARYLAND CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION\nA.  GENERAL\nOn the day of the site visit, the Deputy Warden reported that\nthe census was  1116 males. The age of the inmate population\nranged  form  16 to  60 years of age, with  the average age of\nabout 24 years.  The average length of sentence was reported\nas about 16 years.\nThe  food  service  and  preparation  facilities  at  this\ninstitution were being renovated.  The kitchen at the Training\nfacility,  at which  meals were  previously  prepared  for MCI,\nwas closed  for renovations.  A new kitchen facility had been\nopened at the main warehouse location.  Most of the food for\n\nthe inmates and staff at MCI and some items for the RCI are\nprepared at the new kitchen.  RCI prepares most  of the foods\nfor the inmates housed in the Huts or WPDC.\nB.  FOOD STORAGE/SANITATION\nInspection  of  food  storage  facilities  at  the  main  facility\nrevealed problems  in the following areas:\no  In  the  main  kitchen,  improperly  stored  foods  and  poor\nstorage  conditions  were  noted.  The  dry  storage  room\nlacked  ventilation.  An  old  refrigerator  was  used  for\nstorage.  The  air  in  this  area  was  stale  and  moist.\nRoaches were also observed in this area.\nOne  refrigerator  contained  uncovered  foods  (grapefruit\nhalves) and another had food stored directly on the floor\n(onions).  This  promotes  nutrient  and  flavor  losses  and\nfosters contamination.  All of the refrigerators were old\nand some were in need of repair.\no  At WPDC  (C Building),  the following sanitation problems\nwere noted:\nEating utensils were not properly cleaned and sanitized.\nObservation  of  the  cleaning  process  revealed  that\nutensils  are  hand-washed  and  dried  with  a  cloth.\nInspection of washed utensils showed that some contained\n\nfood  debris.  These  cleaning  procedures  are  not\nconsistent  with  those  specified  in  the  Food  Service\nOperation  Mann*! . Dishwashing  ^efcion.  which  specifies\nthat \" not fewer than three compartments must be used for\nmanual washing, rinsing and  sanitizing of utensils...\".\nUtensils  should  also  be  allowed  to  air  dry  after\nsanitizing to prevent  contaminations.\nFacilities  were  available  in  the  food  service area  for\nhand washing, but no soap was available.\no  At  the  Central  Kitchen  [new  facility],  I observed  that\nthe storage areas were tidy and had clean walls, floors,\nand proper temperature control.  However, uncovered foods\nwere  observed  in  two  refrigerators,  namely  beef  steaks\nand  tomato  sauce.  This  practice  promote  potential\ncontamination  of  foods  and  contribute  to  flavor  and\nnutrient loss.\nPoor food handling procedures were employed by staff at\nRCI.  On the day of the visit,  hamburger patties were\nbeing prepared for cooking the following day.  Interview\nof  the  Supervisory  Dietary  Officer  about this  process\nreveals the following:\no  Hamburger  had  been  placed  in  the  refrigerator\novernight to thaw.\n\no  Hamburger had been removed from the refrigerator at\nabout 10:00 am on May 27, when the pre-preparation\nprocess had started.\no  After the patties were placed on the pans, the pans\nwere  then  put  on  carts  that  hold  about  ten  pans\neach.\no  At  the  time  of  the  visit  [1:30]  about  seven  (7)\ncarts  were  in  the  kitchen  and  about  30 pounds  of\nhamburger was on the preparation  table. Inspection\nof  the  refrigerators  showed  that  none  of  the\nhamburger  had been  refrigerated.  The hamburger was\nnot  refrigerated  for  more  than  three and  one-half\nhours.  The temperature of the kitchen [about 78 F]\nwas optimal for  the proliferation of bacteria.  The\nhamburger  should  have  been  removed  from  the\nrefrigerator in small quantities for preparation and\nrefrigerated  immediately  after  each  tray  was\ncompleted.  The  Dietary  Officer  was  apprised  of\npotential danger of not refrigerating the meats for\nsuch a long period of time.\nII.  FOOD PREPARATION AND SERVICE\nFoods are prepared  in several kitchens  for inmates housed at\nthe  Hagerstown  campus:  the  main  kitchen  at  MCI  (soup  is\nreportedly  prepared  in  this  facility);  the  central  kitchen\n\n(the new food service facility located on the lower level of\nthe main warehouse where foods are prepared for MCI, RCI and\nthe Huts  [WPDC]); and RCI (trays  used at the Huts (WPDC) are\nsanitized and some foods are prepared here).\nFood preparation activities for meals to be served on the day\nof the site visit was largely completed by 1:30 pra. Therefore,\nlittle food preparation was observed  in any of the kitchens.\nThe  following  findings  are  based  on  observations  at  the\nCentral Kitchen and discussions with staff.\no  Upon arrival at RCI at about 1:30 p.m., most of the food\npreparation  for  the  evening  meal  had  been  completed.\nBaked  fish  was  being  placed  in  serving  containers  for\ntransport to the various  facilities.  The peas, collard\ngreens  and  other  items,  except  the  sauce,  had  already\nbeen loaded in transport units.\no  Interview of the Dietary Officer in charge revealed that\nmost  foods,  including  the  collard  greens,  had  been\nprepared  starting  at  9:00  am,  and  had  been  loaded  on\ntransport carts at about 10:30 am.  These foods were held\nin the heated carts for transport starting at about 2:00\npm.  Meal  service  for  dinner  was  reported  to  start  at\nabout 4:30 pm.  Thus, the  prepared food items were held\nfor  up  to  six  hours.  Foods  should  be  served  as soon.\n\nafter  preparation  as  possible  to  maximize  its\npalatability, appearance, and nutritional value.\nA temperature check was conducted of the fish before it\nwas placed in the heated cart.  This check revealed that\nthe temperature was only 100 F.  This temperature is in\nthe  danger  zone, where  the  growth  and  reproduction  of\ngerms  and  bacteria  are  enhanced.  The  Dietary  Officer\nreported  that  all  the  heat  units  were  plugged  in  and\nturned on subsequent to loading the foods; this assertion\nwas not supported by observations.  Two carts containing\nfoods were not turned on.  This matter was brought to the\nattention of the Officer.\nThe Dietary Officer was also questioned about  the use of\nstandardized  recipes.  While  recipes  were  reportedly\navailable, they were not being used.  Use of standardized\nrecipes assure that the nutrition value, flavor and yield\nare  consistently  high.  Failure  to  use  standardized\nrecipes  compromises  the  quality  of  the  food  and\ncontribute to shortage (small yield).\nService of both regular and medical diets were observed\nduring the  lunch meal at MCI.  Inmates were interviewed\nabout the acceptability  of foods and  problems they had\nexperienced with special diets.  The following findings\n\nwere documented:\nFOOd Service WaS handled efficiently.  The inmates\nexercised care in putting foods onto the trays and\nin giving the appropriate serving size.\nTemperature  test  of  foods  served  revealed  that\ntemperatures  were below the  standard  for avoidance\nof  bacterial  growth  and  for  maximum  palatability.\nThe  Dietary  Officer  that  observed  these  variances\nhad the cold food replaced  with a new container of\nfood.  While this was appropriate, the unacceptable\ntemperature  of  the  foods  is  likely  to  continue\nuntil the cause is addressed.  Observations at RCI\nindicated  that  foods  are  held  for  long periods  of\ntime before they are transported  and served.  This\npractice  is  a  contributing  factor  in  the  low\ntemperature  of  the  food,  but  time  and  temperature\ntest of the food production and transport system are\nneeded  to  clearly  identify  the  cause(s)  of  the\ntemperature problem.\nDietary  Officers  did  not  routinely  or  periodically\ncheck  the  temperature  of  the  foods.  Since  a\ndecentralized  kitchen  is used  at  this  institution,\ntime  and  temperature  monitoring  are  essential  to\n10\n\nassure  the  safety  and  palatability  of  foods  (both\nhot and cold).\nConsiderable variation was noted in the foods served\nand those specified on the cycle menu.  None of the\nitems specified on the cycle menu for the lunch meal\nwas  served.  These changes  in the planned  versus\nthe actual menu were not recorded.  At the evening\nmeal, blackeye  peas, collard greens and cherry pie\nwere  substituted  for  boiled  sliced  potatoes,\nbuttered beets and cookies. Occasional substitutions\nare made in most food service operations.  However,\nsteps  must  be  taken  to  assure  that  the  items\nsubstituted  are  of  comparable  nutritional  quality\nand  acceptable  (i.e. that  texture, consistency  and\ncolor  are  complementary  to  the  rest  of  the  menu\nitems served) .  All substitutions made  in the menu\nshould be recorded so accurate records of the foods\nserved to the population  are maintained.\nVisual inspection of the items served for the lunch\nmeal  revealed  that  foods  were  over-cooked.  For\nexample, the rice in the chicken soup  was difficult\nto  recognize.  The  spinach was  also  o'ver-cooked.\nThis  is not  surprising  considering  that  vegetables\nwere cooked and held in heated carts for up to  six\n11\n\n[6] hours.  The vegetables used at MCI are generally\ncanned  products.  A  more  carefully  prepared  food\nproduction  schedule  could  easily  eliminate  the\nproblem  of overcooked vegetables  and  increase both\nthe nutritional  quality  and  acceptability  of these\nfoods.  The most frequently cited problem expressed\nby the inmates interviewed was that the foods were\noften overcooked.\nMany nutrients are heat sensitive and water soluble.\nProlonged  cooking  and  holding  of  foods/  such  as\nvegetables, affects  the palatability  of the foods\nserved.  Important vitamins are also released into\nthe  cooking  liquid  and  destroyed  by  prolonged\nheating  and  cooking.  While  the  nutrient  levels\ncalculated  from  the  planned  menu  were  consistent\nwith  the  Recommended  Dietary  Allowance,  the  food\npreparation  practices  at  this facility  results in\nreduced  nutrient  availability  in  foods  served.\nThis is particularly true of water soluble vitamins\n(thiamin,  folacin,  niacin,  riboflavin,  B6,  B12,\npantothenic  acid,  folacin,biotin,  and  vitamin c).\nNutrients which are unstable to heat will be greatly\nreduced (thiamin, folacin, vitamin c).\no  Interviews  with  inmates  on medical  diets  revealed  that\n12\n\nmany  had  not  received  dietary  instructions.  These\nindividuals should be counseled  concerning foods allowed\non their medical diets and the foods contraindicated.  of\nthe  eight  inmates  interviewed, only three reported that\nthey  had  received  instructions  from  the  Dietitian  or\nphysician  about their diets.  I observed  that at  least\ntwo  inmates  had  items  on  their  trays  that  were  not\nallowed  on  their  medical  diets.  For  example,  a\nhypertensive inmate had table salt on his tray.  Most of\nthe  inmates  on  medical  diets  had  received  saltine\ncrackers,  although  many  of  these  persons  were  on  low\nsodium diets.  The size of the portions served to inmates\non calorie controlled medical diets was  not adjusted to\nreflect  the  lower  caloric  levels  of  their  diets.  For\nexample,  an  inmate  on  the  2400  Calorie  Diabetic  Diet\nreceived  the  same  foods  in  the  same  quantity  as  the\ninmate  on  a  Diabetic  Diet  without  caloric  restriction.\nReview  of  the  diet  menu  sheets  did  not  resolve  this\ndiscrepancy.\nNo  provision  was  made  for  persons  who  for  religious\nreasons,  do  not  consume  any  or  only  limited  animal\nproducts.  Religious  affiliations  that  customarily\nrestrict  the  use of  animal products  include but  is not\nlimited to Hindus, Rastafarian, Muslims, Christians, and\nJews.  Provision of foods compatible with the  religious\n13\n\nbeliefs,  is  a  generally  acceptable  practice  in\ninstitutions of all kinds.\n14\n\nMARYLAND BOUSB OP CORRECTIONS (JUHB 10,1989)\nCORRAL OVERVIEW\nInstitutional  officials  who  accompanied  the  site visit  team\nincluded  Lt.  Smith,  Correctional  Dietary  Officer(CDO);  Mr.\nSmith,  Deputy  Warden;  and  Warden  Singleton.  About  1370\ninmates are housed in this facility.\nAn estimated 200 inmates were  on medical diets. This facility\nis very old with the kitchen on two levels.  Most of the 1370\ninmates are fed in the main cafeteria, located adjacent to the\nkitchen, with about 100 inmates [those in  segregation] eating\non the cell blocks.\nFood  service  staff  consists  of  17  CDO's  and many inmates.\nFoods are prepared and served by the  inmates assigned to the\nkitchen.  The  CDO's  supervise  the  inmates  in  carrying  out\ntheir responsibilities.\nFOOD STORAGE AND SANITATION\nHousekeeping  and  sanitation  are  serious  problems  at  this\ninstitution.  Generally,  the  food  preparation  and  storage\nareas were  maintained in a very sloven manner.  Officials of\nthe institution reported that  efforts had been made to repair\nand  clean  the  facility  subsequent  to  the  visit  by  Mr  Ted\n15\n\nGordon, that occurred the previous week.  However, the level\nof  housekeeping  and  sanitation  observed  were  far  below\nstandards.  The  following  are  examples  of  the  conditions\nobserved rather than a comprehensive list of problems noted:\no  Personnel, both CDOs and  inmates, were not outfitted  in\nthe appropriate attire, i.e. hats, gloves, clean aprons,\netc.  These  articles  were  put  on,  however,  when  the\narrival of the site visit team was detected.\no  Foods were not properly wrapped in various refrigeration\nunits,  thus  promoting  contamination,  nutrient  lost  and\nfood quality deterioration.\no  Neither hot water nor soap was available for hand washing\npurposes in the vegetable preparation area.\no  In the bakery, the wooden table on which butter was being\nportioned was covered with a layer of dirty water.  The\ninmate working on this assignment did  not put on gloves\nuntil  this  error  was  brought  to  his  attention.  Food\npreparation equipment in this area was covered with dust\nand was not well cleaned.\no  In the dry storage areas, numerous roaches, both dead and\nalive, were observed  .  In addition, a dead mouse was in\n16\n\na  glue  trap.  The  mouse,  if  allowed  to  fester,  would\npromote  the  growth  of  other pests, namely  flies.  The\nflies would spread the germs to food containers and food\nstuffs  in  the  storage  area  as  well  as  to  the  food\npreparation area.  The floors, walls and windowsills  in\nthese areas were covered with accumulated dirt and other\ndebris.\no  Unlined garbage cans were used as storage containers for\nsugar and other food stuffs.  These units were cleaned;\nthe lids of these containers were covered with dirt and\ndead  insects.  These  materials  could  contaminate  the\nfoods.\no  Evidence of smoking was found in the storage areas, i.e.\ncigarette butts were observed in this area.\no  Inspection  of the meat slicer revealed accumulated meat\ngrease and  food particles.  The  staff reported that the\nequipment had just been disassembled and cleaned.  At the\nrequest of the Deputy Warden this equipment was promptly\ncleaned again.\no  The  walls  in  the  main  kitchen  were  in  the  process  of\nbeing  plastered  [showing  that  corrective  actions  had\nbeen taken since the last inspection]\n17\n\no  The kitchen was not clean.  The ovens were dirty as were\nwalls, floors and hoods.  The grease vats in the grills\nwere overflowing with grease and water.  This problem was\nresolved on the instructions of the Deputy Warden.  The\nhood  over  the  stoves  were  reportedly  cleaned after the\nprevious  inspection.  However,  grease  and  dirt  had\nstarted to  accumulate in the upper parts of the hoods.\no  Foods were placed directly on the floor.  This could lead\nto contamination of food preparation surfaces by cleaning\nagents,  bacteria,  germs  and  other  substances  when  the\nfood containers are transferred.\nFOOD PREPARATION AND SERVICE\nFoods  are generally  served  cafeteria  style.  However,inmates\nhoused in  special units, such as the hospital and segregated\nunits, eat in the cell blocks.  In the latter case, foods are\nput  in  styrofoam  containers  or transported  in bulk to these\nareas for service to these groups.\nOn  the  day  of  the  site  visit,  the  lunch  meal  consisted  of\nsliced  cold-cuts, macaroni  salad,  garden  salad with oil and\nvinegar dressing, mustard, mayonnaise, applesauce and beverage\n(the fruit drink mix was vitamin C enriched).  The following\n18\n\nis a listing of major findings.\no  There was  some evidence that standardized  recipes  files\nare used.  However, the recipe file  for the foods being\nprepared  for the  evening meal,  could  not be  located  to\nverify  that  all  the  appropriate  ingredients  were  being\nused  and  were  being  combined  in  accordance  with  the\nrecipe instructions.  Use of standardized recipes assure\nthat  the  foods  prepared  are  of  consistently  high\nnutritional  value,  flavor  and  yield.  Failure  to  use\nstandardized  recipes  compromises  the  quality  and\ncontributes to shortage (small yield).\no  The styrofoam trays and food carts used to transport food\nto  the  decentralized  units  were  not  appropriate  for\nefficient  service  of  the  foods  or  for the retention  of\nthe foods at appropriate temperatures.  The chicken that\nhad been placed on  special diet trays had a  temperature\nof 120 F.  It took about 15 minutes to complete the diet\ntrays.  When  the  trays were  completed,  the  temperature\nhad  already  fallen  to  105 F. While  it is unlikely  that\nsufficient  bacteria  growth  would  occur  in  fifteen\nminutes to cause food borne illness, every effort should\nbe  made  to  assure  that  the  temperatures  of  potential\nhazardous  foods do  not  fall within  the danger  range of\n40-120 F.\n19\n\no  Temperature  problems  were  also  noted  for  regular  diet\nitems.  Specifically,  the  macaroni  salad  had  a  pre-\nservice  temperature  of  about  60  F.  The  macaroni  salad\ncontain eggs and mayonnaise, both of which are excellent\nmediums for bacteria growth and should be maintained  at\ntemperatures of 40 F of less.  In an attempt to identify\ntire cause of the temperature problem, temperatures of the\nmacaroni  salad  under  refrigeration  were  taken.  These\ntemperature  tests  revealed  that  the  product  in  the\nrefrigerator was also  60 F.  No thermometer was located\nin the refrigerator. However, improper functioning could\nhave been due to  cracks in the refrigerator seals.\no  Interviews  with  staff  and  inmates  indicated  that  there\nhave  been  several  outbreaks  of  stomach  discomfort\nfollowing the consumption of a salad meal.\no  The macaroni  salad was  stored in very deep containers.\nThis increases the time  it takes for the salad to reach\nuniform  and  safe  temperature  levels.  The  internal\ntemperature  [  center  of  the  product]  would  reach  an\nappropriate temperature much later than the food near the\nsides.  Products that are highly perishable should not be\nstored  in deep containers, and they should be kept in a\nfunctioning  refrigerator  unit  until  served.  During\n20\n\nservice, care must be taken to assure  that  these  foods\nare retained at temperatures  below 40 F.\nRegular and medical diets service were observed  [lunch].\nInmates were interviewed about the acceptability of foods\nand problems they had experienced with special diets.  A\nplate  waste  survey  was  also  competed.  The  following\nfindings were documented:\no  Food  service  in  the  cafeteria  was  handled\nefficiently. The inmates were careful  in  putting  foods\non the trays and  for the most part, appropriate portion\nsizes were served.\no  Dietary  Officers  did  not routinely  or  periodically\ncheck  the  temperature  of  the  foods.  Since  foods  are\ntransported  to  decentralized  areas,  time/temperature\nchecks  are  essential  to  assure  the  safety  and\npalatability  of  foods(both  hot  and  cold).  All  CDO's\nshould  carry  thermometers  and  use  them  periodically  to\ntest temperatures.\no  No  provisions  were  made  for  persons  who  for\nreligious  reasons,  do  not  consume  any  or  only  limited\namounts of animal products.  Religious affiliations that\ncustomarily  restrict  the use of animal products  include\n21\n\nbut  is  not  limited  to  Hindus,  Rastafarian,  Muslims,\nChristians, and Jews.  Provision of foods compatible with\nthe religious beliefs is a generally acceptable practice\nin institutions of all kinds.\no  Service  of  special  diets  in  the  cafeteria  was\nefficient. However,  portion size instructions were not\nprovided for  calorie controlled medical diets.\nA plate waste study was done of 60 trays to determine the\nlevel of food acceptability.  The results of this study\nare as follows:  Forty-one  percent  [41%]  of  the\ninmates did not consume at least one ounce of the cold\ncuts; 25% did not consume 2-4 ounces of macaroni salad;\n13% did not consume 2-4 ounces of the garden salad; 5%\ndid not consume one or more slices of bread; and, 23% did\nnot consume 2-4 ounces of applesauce.  The scope of the\nsurvey did  not  include determining  the  reasons  foods\nwere  not  consumed.  However,  problems  with  illness\nsubsequent to ingestion of some of these items may be a\nfactor.  The  level  of  dissatisfaction  with  the\ntemperatures of the foods may be another factor.\nA  food  satisfaction  survey was completed  of about 50\ninmates  in  this  facility.  The  survey  revealed  the\nfollowing major complaints: lack of variety in the foods\n22\n\nserved;  improper  temperatures  of  foods  served;  and\nimproperly seasoned foods.  Complaints concerning stomach\nor  intestinal  distress  after  consumption  of  highly\nperishable  items were also frequent.  Inmates  indicated\nthat outbreaks of illnesses have occurred on at least two\nrecent occasions. One occasion of food borne illness was\nverified  by  officials.  Some  inmates  were  reportedly\nhospitalized  for these problems  following  the  ingestion\nof highly perishable items.  Concerns were also expressed\nabout the availability of vegetarian diets.\nMany  concerns  were  made  about  use  of  wet  food  trays.\nInspection of the trays revealed that they were very wet.\nThe  cause  of  the  wet  trays  was  either  improper\ndishwashing techniques and/or low water temperatures.\nThe  food  service  process  for  inmates  housed  in  the\nsegregation units was observed  from the point the foods\nleft  the  kitchen  until  served  to  the  inmates.  The\nequipment used for this purpose was not appropriate.  The\ncart did not have the capacity to keep foods hot or cold,\nand  one  side  of  the  cart was  open.  Foods were placed\ninside  and  on  top  of  the  cart.  The  transport  process\ntook  about  12 minutes  from  kitchen  to  the  cell blocks,\nincluding  the  time  it  took  to  replace  a  container  of\nmayonnaise  that  fell  off  the  top  of  the  cart.  The\n23\n\nfollowing  comments  and  observations  are  provided\nconcerning this process.\no  The  equipment  used  to  transport  the  foods\ncontributed to  the deterioration of the  temperatures of\nthe foods served. Forty minutes were required to complete\nmeal service to inmates on two floors.  The temperature\nof  the  foods  continued  to  change  during  the  service\nprocess.\no  The food service was very inefficient.  Foods were\nserved  from  the  cart  on  a device  constructed  from  two\ntrays.  The  inmate  serving  the  food  onto  trays  had to\nbend over and squat down to get to the foods.  He then\ncarried the tray to inmates' cells.  Use of a temperature\ncontrolled food transport cart would eliminate bending by\nthe inmate and increase  efficiency in  transferring the\nfoods to trays.  The cart, if properly used, would retain\nthe  foods  at  adequate  temperatures  throughout  the  food\nservice process.  Assignment of another inmate to assist\nin carrying the foods to the men would further expedite\nthe  process.  Proper  transport  equipment  would  also\nreduce the potential of accidents.\no  Foods for inmates who work outside of the prison are put\non  styrofoam  trays  and  delivered  to  the  men  by  two\n24\n\ninmates. The inmate responsible for preparing these trays\nwas  extremely  slow  in  completing  bis  work.  He  took\nalmost one hour to complete the trays.  Temperature tests\nof  the  macaroni  salad  showed  that  it  had  reached  a\ntemperature  of  80  F  on  some  of  the  trays  when  this\nprocess was completed.\n25\n\nIX.  RBCOMMBHDATIOHS\nThยป  following  general  recommendations  are  made  for  both\ninstitutions, in addition to those offered throughout the site\nvisit.\no  Procedures and schedules for cleaning of all food service\nareas and equipment need to be developed.  The procedures\nshould  identify  how the areas  and  equipments  are to be\ncleaned  [how  to  take  the  equipment  apart,  if  this  is\nwarranted];  what  products  are  to  be  used  to  clean  the\narea  and  equipment;  how  often  each  area  and  piece  of\nequipment  is to be cleaned; and, who is responsible for\ncleaning what areas.  A system to document that each job\nwas  correctly  completed  is  essential.  The  CDO\nresponsible  for  housekeeping  and  sanitation  should  be\nrequired to initial the schedule verifying that each job\nwas  inspected  and  was  done  in  accordance  with  the\nstandards.  CDOs  should  be  held  accountable  for their\nareas of responsibility.\no  CDOs  should  carry  thermometers  at  all  times. Further,\nthey should routinely test and record the temperatures of\nfoods  at  key points  in the food  service process.  At a\nminimum, temperatures  should  be taken prior to putting\nthe foods on to trays and again prior to  serving.\no  A comprehensive procedure manual should be developed than\n26\n\naddresses  all  aspects  of  the  food  service  system,\nincluding,  but  not  United  to  sanitation,  storage,\npreparation,  menu  planning,  food  service,  housekeeping\nprocedures,  equipment  maintenance,  dishwashing  and\nutensil  cleaning,  emergency  food  service  plan  (natural\ndisaster  and  others),  food  production  and  scheduling,\netc.\nComprehensive  training  related  to  the  above  procedures\nneeds  to  be provided  for both  inmates  and  CDOs.  Food\nservice  supervision  training  should also be provided to\nall Officers.\nAppropriate  equipment  should  be  procured  to  meet  the\nneeds  of  the  institution.  Procurement  of  temperature\ncontrolled  food  transport  equipment  is  essential.\nInsulated  trays  are  also  needed  for  special  diets, as\nwell as  transport containers.  In addition a preventive\nmaintenance  program  is  needed  to  keep  equipment\noperating correctly at all times, such as the elevators,\nrefrigerators, etc.\nAn  ongoing  monitoring  system  needs  to be developed  and\nimplemented  to  assure  that  CDOs  provide  leadership  by\nexample and that they  hold the  inmate staff  accountable\nfor  their  duties.  If  inmates  are  properly  trained  in\n27\n\nfood  service  operations,  these  skills  can  be  used  to\nsecure  employment  subsequent  to  release.  Prison\nofficials may wish to visit other prisons with successful\nprograms of this nature.\nAppropriate  menu  adjustments  should  be made  to  provide\ninmates, who  for religious reasons  require a vegetarian\ndiets or substitutes  for pork items.  Further the menus\nshould  be  analyzed  on  periodic  basis  to  assure\nnutritional  adequacy  and  adherence  to  current  dietary\nrecommendations.  Specifically, careful attention should\nbe  given  to  fat, cholesterol  and  sodium  levels  in  the\ndiets  of  this  population  group.  Males  in general  and\nblack males  in particular are at increased risk for the\ndevelopment  of  cardiovascular  disease,  to  which\nexcessive  intakes  of  these  food  components  have  been\nclearly  linked.  This  results  in  premature  deaths  of\nmales, particularly minority groups.  These facts support\ndietary  modifications  of  menus  to  conform  to  the  most\nrecent scientific information.\n28\n\nFOOD AND NUTRITION BOARD.

Civil Action WMN-77-113\nCivil Action WMN-78-1730\nBISHOP L. ROBINSON, et al. (consolidated with Civil\nAction WMN-77-116)\nMEMORANDUM\nDuring the course of the last year and a half, several\nmotions have been filed in these consolidated actions responding\nto the shifting state of federal law as it relates to prisoner\nlitigation.  The most recent legislation, the Prison Litigation\nReform Act of 1995 [\"PLRA\"] Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat 1321,\nยงยง 801-810 (amending 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626) was signed into law by\nPresident Clinton on April 26, 1996.  The following motions must\nbe resolved in light of that new legislation:  in Civil Action\nNo. WMN-77-116 -- Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce Judgment  (Paper\nNo. 461), Defendants' Motion to Vacate or Modify the Stipulation\n(Paper No. 467), and Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment\n(Paper No. 477); and in Civil Action WMN-77-113/Civil Action WMN\n78-1730 -- Defendants' Motion to Terminate the Stipulated\nAgreements  (Paper No. 498) and Plaintiffs' Motion for Evidentiary\nHearing Pursuant to Section 3626(b)(3) of the Prison Litigation\nReform Act and For Enforcement of the 1987 Stipulated Agreements\nwith Respect to Health Care (Paper No. 502).  After numerous\nextensions of time to allow the parties to respond to these\nvarious pleadings, all of these motions are now fully briefed.\nUpon a review of the motions and the applicable case law, the\n\nCourt determines that no hearing is necessary  (Local Rule 105.6),\nand that in both actions, Plaintiffs' motions will be denied, and\nDefendants' motions will be granted.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Civil Action WMN-77-113/Civil Action WMN-78-1730\nThis litigation began in 1977 when a class of inmates at the\nMaryland House of Correction  [\"MHC\"] sued the Maryland Department\nof Public Safety and Correctional Services and various State\nofficials alleging that overcrowding in the facility constituted\na violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.  In 1978, a similar suit was filed challenging the\nconditions at the Maryland Correctional Institute at Hagerstown\n[\"MCI-H\"].  These suits were subsequently consolidated.\nIn 1983, the parties entered into a stipulated agreement\nproviding for population caps and other procedures to address the\nconditions at both facilities.  In 1987, Plaintiffs moved to\nmodify that agreement.  As the result of negotiations, the\nparties entered into a new stipulated agreement on July 8, 1987,\nresolving a majority of the claims raised by Plaintiffs.  On\nDecember 3, 1987, the parties agreed to a supplemental stipulated\nagreement resolving the remaining issues.  These agreements\nprovided comprehensive prospective relief governing a broad\nspectrum of issues: population limitations, including limits on\ndoublecelling and doublebunking; environmental conditions,\nincluding repair and replacement of windows, plumbing fixtures,\npainted surfaces, roofing, and ventilation systems; food\n\nservices; security; programming, including work, recreational,\nand educational programs; and health care.  These agreements were\napproved by this Court and have been in force since February 19,\n1988.\nDefendants assert that under the terms of the PLRA they are\nentitled to the immediate termination of these consent decrees.\nPlaintiffs argue in response that, before the decrees can be\nterminated, Plaintiffs are entitled to an evidentiary hearing in\norder to determine whether there are \"current and ongoing\"\nconstitutional violations warranting continued prospective\nrelief.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs challenge the\nconstitutionality of the PLRA.\nB. Civil Action No. 77-116\nPlaintiffs in this action are prisoners and pre-trial\ndetainees incarcerated at the Maryland Penitentiary, a state\nprison facility located in Baltimore.  In November 1985, the\nparties entered into a stipulation that was subsequently approved\nby Judge Alexander Harvey II on March 10, 1986.  Only two\nprovisions of this Stipulation have continuing effect, a cap on\nthe total number of prisoners that can be housed at the facility\nand a restriction on the double celling of inmates in\nsegregation.\nIn October of 1995, Plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce\njudgment alleging that Defendants had violated the terms of the\nStipulation by exceeding the population cap.  In reaching this\nconclusion, Plaintiff included in their population count\n\nprisoners housed in the Maryland Transition Services Center\n[\"MTSC\"], a new facility constructed on the site of one of the\nformer housing wings of the Penitentiary complex.  Defendants\nresponded to that motion with a motion to vacate or modify the\nstipulation.  Defendants argued that the MTSC was not a part of\nthe Penitentiary, and thus, its inmates should not be included in\ndetermining if the population cap had been violated.  In the\nalternative, Defendants argued that under former Section 3 62 6 of\n18 U.S.C,1 the Stipulation must be reopened and modified to make\nit consistent with the current state of federal Eighth Amendment\njurisprudence.  On the day before President Clinton signed the\nPLRA into law, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment,\nattaching a report of the warden of the Penitentiary which\nPlaintiffs viewed as conclusive evidence that the MTSC was a part\nof the Penitentiary, and that accordingly, the Defendants were in\nviolation of the Stipulation.\nIn response to the passage of the PLRA, Defendants\nsupplemented their motion to vacate the Stipulation on October\n15, 1996.  Plaintiffs responded to this pleading by arguing that\nthe PLRA was unconstitutional.  As in the MHC/MIC-H litigation,\nPlaintiffs also argue that they should be given the opportunity\nto demonstrate a current and ongoing constitutional violation at\nthe Penitentiary.  Unlike the MHC/MIC-H Plaintiffs, however, the\n1 Section 20409(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law\nEnforcement Act of 1994, P.L. 103-322, 108 Stat 1796, popularly\nknown as the \"Helms Amendment.\"  This provision was repealed by\nthe passage of. the PLRA.\n\nPenitentiary Plaintiffs do not state with any specificity what\nthat violation might be.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. The Prison Litigation Reform Act\nIn passing the PLRA, Congress sought to \"provid[e]\nreasonable limits on the remedies available\" in lawsuits\nconcerning prison conditions.  Plyler v. Moore. 100 F.3d 365  (4th\nCir. 1996)(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 21, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 7\n(1995)) .  Consistent with those limitations, Congress determined\nthat prospective relief in prisoner litigation should \"extend no\nfurther than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\nright of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\"  18 U.S.C.A. ยง\n3626(a)(1)(A).  Congress also provided in the PLRA an avenue for\nstates to end their obligations under existing consent decrees\nthat exceeded those limitations:\nIMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF PROSPECTIVE\nRELIEF.--In any civil action with respect\nto prison conditions, a defendant or\nintervener shall be entitled to the\nimmediate termination of any prospective\nrelief if the relief was approved or\ngranted in the absence of a finding by the\ncourt that the relief is narrowly drawn,\nextends no further than necessary to\ncorrect the violation of the Federal right,\nand is the least intrusive means necessary\nto correct the violation of the Federal\nright.\n18 U.S.C.A.  ยง 3626(b)(2).\nThe PLRA provides a limited exception to the immediate\ntermination provision.\n(b)(3) LIMITATION -- Prospective relief shall\n\nnot terminate if the court makes written\nfindings based on the record that prospective\nrelief remains necessary to correct a current\nor ongoing violation of the Federal right,\nextends no further than necessary to correct\nthe violation of the federal right, and that\nthe prospective relief is narrowly drawn and\nthe least intrusive means to correct the\nviolation.\n18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3626(b)(3).\nIn passing the PLRA, Congress also sent a clear message that\nCourts are to determine as expeditiously as possible whether a\nconsent decree must be terminated.  The statute calls for the\n\"immediate termination of prospective relief.\"  Subsection\n(e)(1) of the statute mandates that courts \"shall promptly rule\non any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a\ncivil action with respect to prison conditions.\"  Furthermore,\nsubsection (e)(2)(A)(I) provides that an automatic stay of\nprospective relief will take effect thirty days after any motion\nto terminate is filed.2\nB. Civil Action WMN-77-113/Civil Action WMN-78-1730\nIn the MHC/MIC-H litigation, it is undisputed that there was\nno finding that the stipulated agreement represented a \"narrowly\ndrawn\" or \"least intrusive\" means to address a constitutional\nviolation.  In approving the parties' agreement, the Court made\n2 Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of this\nautomatic stay provision.  In this action, however, the parties\nstipulated to briefing schedules that had the result that the\nstay under this provision went into effect before the motions\nwere ripe for decision.  Because the Court finds that the consent\ndecrees must be terminated, it need not address the\nconstitutionality of the automatic stay provision of\n3626(e)(2)(A)(I).\n\nno findings whatsoever.  Defendants state explicitly in the\nstipulation that they are not admitting that any of the\nconditions complained of constituted a violation of the\nConstitution.  Thus, the immediate termination provisions of ยง\n3626(b)(2) are applicable.\nThe Court must then consider whether this case falls within\nthe ยง 3626(b)(3) exception to the immediate termination\nprovision.  While apparently conceding that most of the terms in\nthe consent decree are not constitutionally required and\ntherefore must be terminated, Plaintiffs in their most recent\npleadings have focused their attention on issues relating to\nhealth care delivery.  Plaintiffs contend that this Court should\nallow limited discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the quality of health care provided at MHC and\nMCI-H is so deficient that at least those portions of the\nstipulated agreements relating to health care must remain in\nforce in order to correct a current or ongoing constitutional\nviolation.\nWithout resolving the question as to whether an evidentiary\nhearing is ever permitted or required in response to a ยง\n3626(b)(2) motion to terminate, the Court finds that such a\nhearing is not called for in the instant action.  In support of\ntheir motion for a hearing, Plaintiff submitted reports detailing\nspecific incidents where the health care provided to inmates\nallegedly fell below that mandated under the stipulated\nagreements.  Even should some of these incidents also rise to the\n\nlevel of institutional \"deliberate indifference\" necessary to\nestablish a constitutional violation, see Estelle v. Gamble. 429\nU.S. 97, 104 (1976), the Court is still not convinced that these\nallegations warrant the broad system-wide prospective relief\nrequired under the stipulated agreements.  As Defendants counter,\nthese individual claims of denial of medical care can and should\nbe addressed in suits for individual relief.\nThis conclusion is strengthened by a review of the record in\nthis action.  Plaintiffs' counsel have had liberal access to the\ninstitutions since the entry of the stipulated agreements.\nMonthly reports have been filed with the Court and, from time to\ntime, Plaintiffs have brought specific concerns regarding\nDefendants1 compliance with those agreement to this Court's\nattention.  Most recently, on October 20, 1995, Plaintiffs filed\na motion to compel compliance with the stipulated agreement\nrelated to the issue of doublebunking at MHC.  Paper No. 461.\nPrior to that motion, on August 2, 1990, Plaintiffs filed a\nmotion for an order to show cause why Defendants should not be\nheld in contempt for failure to comply with the fire safety\nprovisions of the stipulations.  Paper No. 373.  Despite their\nongoing monitoring of the health care delivery systems at MHC and\nMCI-H, Plaintiffs have not, at least in recent years, filed any\nsimilar motions related to health care issues at these\ninstitutions.3\n3 In December 1992, Plaintiffs did file a motion to compel\ndiscovery of records relating to tuberculosis detection, control\nand treatment policies at MHC and MCI-H.  Paper No. 415.  The\n\nC. Civil Action WMN-77-116\nFor similar reasons, the Court finds that the Stipulation in\nCivil Action WMN-77-116 must be vacated.  As in the MHC/MCI-H\nlitigation, it is undisputed that at the time the Stipulation was\nentered into, there was no finding by the Court that the relief\nwas \"narrowly drawn\" or \"the least intrusive\" means to address a\nviolation of a constitutional right.  In the earlier round of\npleadings, Plaintiffs in fact argued that the Stipulation was\n\"premised on compromise between the parties.\"  Paper No. 468 at\n27.\nWithout pointing to any specific constitutional violation,\nPlaintiffs request that the Court delay terminating the\nStipulation in order to give them the opportunity to develop a\nrecord of the current conditions at the Penitentiary.  Plaintiffs\nconcede that making such a record \"would be a major undertaking,\nrequiring considerable discovery and investigation.\"  Paper No.\n500 at 17.  The Court finds this request to be inconsistent with\nthe clear intent of Congress that, as a general rule, consent\ndecrees be terminated as expeditiously as possible.\nD. Constitutional Challenges\nTurning to Plaintiffs' constitutional challenges, Plaintiffs\nacknowledge that most of their challenges have been undercut by\nthe Fourth Circuit's recent decision in Plyler v. Moore.' 100 F.3d\n365  (1996).  In Plyler. the Fourth Circuit considered and\nCourt granted that motion, in part, but heard nothing further\nfrom Plaintiffs on that issue.\n\nrejected separation-of-powers, due process, and equal protection\narguments aimed at the PLRA.  To avoid the Fourth Circuit's\nconclusion that the PLRA is constitutional, Plaintiffs raise two\nadditional arguments not directly addressed by the Fourth Circuit\nin Plyler.\nPlaintiffs in the MHC/MCI-H litigation assert that the PLRA\nviolates the Tenth Amendment.  Plaintiffs argument, in brief, is\nthat because the PLRA does not allow a court to approve a\nsettlement in a prisoner lawsuit unless there is a finding that\nthere was a constitutional violation, the law forces a state to\neither admit wrongdoing or to proceed to trial.  Plaintiffs\ncontend that this limitation of options impermissibly  infringes\non the States' sovereignty and independence.  In so arguing,\nPlaintiffs rely primarily on New York v. United States. 505 U.S.\n144  (1992), in which the Supreme Court stuck down a federal\nhazardous waste statute that forced states to either regulate\nwastes according to Congress's direction or to \"take title\" to\nthe hazardous waste.  The Supreme Court held that, because the\n\"take title\" provision effectively \"commandeer[ed] the\nlegislative process of the States by directly compelling them to\nenact and enforce a federal regulatory program,\" it \"crossed the\nline distinguishing encouragement from coercion.\"  Id. at 175,\n176.\nInitially, the Court notes its agreement with Defendants\nthat it is somewhat ironic for Plaintiffs to argue that a statute\nthat has the effect of terminating more than a decade of federal\n10\n\ncourt supervision over the administration of state prisons is\nsomehow violative of the state sovereignty principles of the\nTenth Amendment.  Courts have frequently emphasized the opposite\nconcern, i.e.. that federal court supervision over state prisons\ncreates the significant potential for encroachment upon state\nsovereignty.  See, e.g., Torcasio v. Murray. 57 F.3d 1340, 1346\n(4th Cir. 1995)(\"the unwillingness of federal courts to intrude\ninto state prison management is . ..  in significant measure\nmotivated by the realization that principles of comity and\nfederalism apply with special force in the context of\ncorrectional facilities\"), cert, denied. 116 S. Ct. 772  (1996).\nThe irony of Plaintiffs' argument is underscored by the fact that\nit is the Plaintiffs complaining about the loss of state\nsovereignty, and not the State.\nIn addition to this conceptual flaw in Plaintiffs' argument,\nthe Court finds New York v. United States inapplicable to the\nPLRA on other grounds.  The statute does not, as Plaintiffs\ncontend, prevent the state from settling prisoner litigation.\nThe PLRA specifically provides that states may enter into private\nsettlement agreements that do not comply with the limitations of\nยง 3626(a).4  In addition, the statute allows parties to seek\nappropriate relief in state courts should a settlement agreement\n4 See ยง 3626(c)(2)(A)(\"Nothing  in this section shall\npreclude parties from entering into a private settlement\nagreement that does not comply with the limitations on relief set\nforth in subsection  (a), if the terms of that agreement are not\nsubject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the\ncivil proceeding that the agreement settled.\").\n11\n\nbe entered into, but then breached.5  The only limitation imposed\nby the statute, albeit a significant limitation, is the\nprevention of the parties from enlisting the federal courts in\nenforcing an agreement that goes beyond what is constitutionally\nrequired of the state.  While it may be more difficult to settle\nprison litigation in this new environment, the Court is not\nconvinced that the option is so completely eliminated so as to\nimplicate the concerns of New York v. United States.\nIn the Maryland Penitentiary litigation, Plaintiffs advance\na variation of the separation-of-powers argument different from\nthat which was raised and rejected in Plyler.  Plaintiffs allege\nthat \"the termination provisions of the PLRA effectively strip\nArticle III courts of their inherent power to impose effective\nremedial measures in constitutional cases that come before them.\"\nPaper No. 500 at 6.  The short answer to Plaintiffs' argument is\nthat the PLRA imposes no such restriction.  The PLRA expressly\nprovides that federal district court shall have and shall\nexercise jurisdiction where the record evinces a constitutional\nviolation.  18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3626(b)(3); Benjamin v. Jacobson, 935\nF. Supp. 332, 351 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)(\"The Court need not enter the\nextensive academic debate surrounding the power of Congress to\ncontrol the jurisdiction of the district courts, however, because\nit is clear that ยง3626(b) . . . preserves the Court's ability to\n5 See ยง 3626(c)(2)(B) (\"Nothing in this section shall\npreclude any party claiming that a private settlement agreement\nhas been breached from seeking in State court any remedy\navailable under State law.\")\n12\n\nenforce constitutional rights.\").\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor all of the above-stated reasons, the Court finds that\nthe PLRA is constitutional and that, as applied to the instant\nlitigation, requires the immediate termination of the consent\ndecrees and stipulations that have been previously approved by\nthis Court.

Johnson v. Levine, 450 F.Supp. 648 (D.Md.1978); Nelson v. Collins, 455\nF.Supp. 727 (D.Md.1978).\nIn Hite v. Leeke, 564 F.2d 670 (4th Cir. 1977), we held that \"double-celling,\" the housing of two prisoners in a cell\ninitially designed for single occupancy, was not itself a violation of the Constitution. It, of course, may be a\nrelevant factor when other consequences of overcrowding create deprivations or impose unusual restrictions and\ndisadvantages upon the prison population.\nIn their opinions, the district judges placed great emphasis upon \"double-celling,\" which was extensive in both\ninstitutions, but other deprivations were also shown. The \"double-celling\" was clearly a consequence of\novercrowding, and the overcrowding had other consequences. The physical and personnel resources of both\ninstitutions were taxed. The overcrowding limited opportunities for recreation, for instruction and rehabilitation,\ncomplicated the maintenance of sanitation, required meal service in three separate shifts and probably\ncontributed to a high level of violence and psychological injury to some prisoners. The medical facilities and staffs\nwere also overtaxed, and on cross-appeals there is a complaint that medical care itself was constitutionally\ndeficient. With the elimination of substantial overcrowding, however, the deficiencies of the medical facilities,\nstaffs and services will be diminished.\nUnder the totality of all of the circumstances, we conclude that the district judges properly found a constitutional\nviolation warranting judicial direction that the overcrowding be eliminated. Overcrowding, with all of its\n1381 consequences, can reach *1381 such proportions that the impact of the aggregate effect amounts to cruel and\nunusual punishment. We believe that the district judges reasonably found that the point had been reached here.\nHence, we affirm the entry of injunctive relief directed to elimination of the overcrowded conditions, and the denial\nof injunctive relief directed to specific areas of alleged deficiencies such as medical care.\nThe district judges directed accelerating steps for the elimination of overcrowding by April 1, 1979. Maryland,\nhowever, has come forward with a detailed plan involving the construction of a new facility, incorporating the\nprevious planned conversion of another, and the early release of prisoners thought appropriate for release which\nwill accomplish the objective of elimination of overcrowded conditions by June 1, 1980.\nThe district judges imposed a short compliance timetable. It was appropriate, of course, to emphasize the fact\nthat the situation was serious, and to require that remedial steps should be undertaken promptly. The release of\nprisoners properly subject to parole may proceed apace, but we are convinced that the overcrowded conditions\ncannot be completely eliminated without the construction and utilization of a new facility, which Maryland\nproposes to have available by June 1, 1980. Since the constitutional violation here is not as extreme or as\nshocking as in some of the reported cases, and since Maryland's plan is practical and reasonable and will\nachieve the required objective of elimination of overcrowding in its penal institutions, we think its plan and its\nschedule deserve judicial approval.\nIn addition to the claims respecting the general prison populations, in Johnson the court found the conditions of\nimprisonment in the Special Confinement Area, a section housing mentally disturbed prisoners, were so severe\n\nthey constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The judge ordered the SCA closed as soon as the inmates could\nbe moved to state mental institutions. In Nelson the court found extended confinement in the punitive isolation\nunit violated the Eighth Amendment. The judge imposed limitations on the use of the cells. We affirm these\nfindings of constitutional deprivation and the grant of appropriate relief.\nThe findings of constitutional overcrowding are affirmed. The decree in Johnson, insofar as it affects the Special\nConfinement Area, and the decree in Nelson, insofar as it deals with punitive isolation, are both affirmed. The\ndenial of specific relief in other respects is affirmed. The cases are remanded to the district court with instructions\nto fashion new decrees which will incorporate Maryland's plan and its schedule for the elimination of\novercrowding in the two penal institutions.\nJudge Russell and Judge Widener dissent from the conclusion that a deficiency of constitutional proportion was\nshown. They reserve the right later to file an opinion expressing their views.\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The order\nspecified a timetable within which Maryland prison officials must make eighty-three improvements at two prison\nfacilities. Our review of the record indicates that the district court exceeded its authority in issuing this order. The\nparties never formally agreed upon the duties specified in the timetable, and these duties add substantially to\nthose accepted by the prison officials in the original consent decree. Absent a proper modification of the consent\ndecree, the district court had no authority to bind state prison officials to the timetable's terms. Accordingly, we\nreverse and remand the case with instructions to deny the plaintiff prisoner group's motion for further relief.\nI.\nThis appeal represents the latest round in an ongoing dispute that began in 1977 over conditions of confinement\nat the Maryland House of Correction (\"MHC\") and the Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown (\"MCI-H\").\nPrisoners at each of the facilities brought class action suits claiming that their conditions of confinement violated\nthe Eighth Amendment. The suits were brought against the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public\nSafety and Correctional Services and various other prison officials. This court consolidated the cases in 1981. \nNelson v. Collins, 659 F.2d 420 (4th Cir.1981). The litigation has produced a series of judicial decrees,\nstipulations, and modifications since 1978, the most recent and relevant being a 1987 Stipulated Agreement\napproved by the district court.\nThe 1987 Agreement calls for prison officials to implement preventive maintenance plans and \"immediately [to]\ncorrect and maintain in good condition all environmental deficiencies\" at both facilities. The 1987 Agreement\n\n1045 requires that prison officials do thirteen things: (1) repair or replace *1045 all broken windows; (2) repair all\ninoperable plumbing; (3) repair roof leaks and exposed electrical wiring; (4) eliminate all cross-connections; (5)\nmaintain a clean, properly painted and plastered environment; (6) use properly maintained and operated\nequipment; (7) correct all fire safety deficiencies in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association\nCode; (8) insulate pipes properly; (9) provide twenty foot-candles of lighting in all living, work, academic, and\nlibrary areas; (10) provide at least ten cubic feet of outside or recirculated air per minute per occupant during the\nsummer; (11) use best efforts to maintain noise decibels at specified levels; (12) correct all public health,\nsanitation, and fire safety violations in punitive isolation units; and (13) provide laundry facilities at MCI-H. The\n1987 Agreement also provides that the district court retains discretionary authority to modify the agreement,\nsubject to the applicable law concerning modification; in addition, \"[e]ither party may seek enforcement of the\nprovisions of this agreement by appropriate motion.\"\nThe 1987 Agreement was reached at a time when the inmate population in the Maryland Division of Corrections\n(the \"MDOC\") was projected to reach 13,338 by 1995. Instead, the male population within MDOC reached 16,182\nby July of 1991. The MDOC responded to this rapid population growth by opening a new facility in 1987, another\nin early 1989, and by funding and opening six other units in 1990 and 1991. Even while undertaking such\nexpensive construction, the MDOC made substantial progress in improving MHC and MCI-H and complying with\nthe 1987 Agreement. Prison officials provided a preventive maintenance plan, and made numerous repairs of\nwindows, plumbing, roof leaks, equipment, pipe insulation, and laundry facilities. Officials also improved other\naspects of the facilities as called for in the 1987 Agreement, including food service, health care, and program\navailability. MHC and MCI-H each have current operating budgets in excess of $35 million, an increase of over\n50% since 1987.\nDissatisfied with the rate of progress being made at the two facilities, the inmate plaintiffs moved to have prison\nofficials held in contempt on August 2, 1990, for allegedly violating several requirements of the 1987 Agreement.\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that officials were not complying with provisions regarding fire safety and the\nhousing of inmates in basement areas. This motion was never ruled upon. Instead, the parties again entered\nnegotiations in the hope of reaching a settlement agreement as they had on prior occasions. These 1990\nnegotiations, however, never culminated in any sort of formal agreement.\nDuring negotiations, the parties compiled a list of eighty-three repairs to be made at the two facilities. Prison\nofficials provided a timetable of projected dates for completing the repairs. The officials anticipated that the\ncompletion of at least some items on the timetable would help to narrow the remaining areas of dispute. The\nofficials further maintained that the timetable was developed with the understanding that its dates of completion\nwere tentative and conditional at all times on obtaining needed funding. The timetable was submitted to the\ndistrict court on several occasions, but only as part of a monthly status report on progress with respect to prison\nrepairs. At no time did the prisoners or the prison officials submit the timetable to the court as part of a formal\nsettlement agreement or proposed consent decree.\nThe timetable consists of both a list of repairs and a specific schedule for completing them. Several of the eighty-\nthree specified improvements, as well as the completion schedule, go well beyond the general requirements of\nthe 1987 Agreement. The 1987 Agreement provides for only twenty foot-candles of lighting in living, work,\nacademic, and library areas. The timetable, by contrast, requires the installation of contractor-supplied, tamper-\nproof, fluorescent light fixtures throughout MHC. The timetable also provides for a complete electrical upgrade\nproject at MCI-H, including improvement of the transformer distribution system and installation of a new\n1046 emergency generator. Neither of these repairs is mentioned in the 1987 Agreement. In *1046 terms of specific\nelectrical repairs, the 1987 Agreement calls only for the repair of all exposed wiring.\nAs for plumbing, the 1987 Agreement requires merely the repair of all inoperable plumbing. The timetable,\nhowever, calls for daily plumbing inspections and repairs, as well as for a complete plumbing upgrade project at\nMCI-H to renovate shower areas, and to replace supply lines, steam lines, and sewer lines. Similarly, the 1987\nAgreement specifies only minimum requirements for outside or recirculated air between the months of May and\nOctober, but the timetable indicates that the prison officials will request $350,000 from the legislature for the\ndesign and installation of a \"mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation system\" for MCI-H.\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, prison officials made substantial progress in completing all of the eighty-three repairs. As of\nJuly 31, 1991, officials had completed sixty-nine of the eighty-three items (83%): the remaining repairs, however,\nincluded the large capital projects to upgrade lighting, plumbing, electrical, and ventilation systems. Progress on\nthe repairs is continuing. Not all repairs at MHC and MCI-H were completed by the dates projected in the\ntimetable, but officials have labored under at least two handicaps. First, MDOC has had to continue building new\nfacilities to house an ever-growing inmate population. Second, an inmate uprising at MCI-H in May of 1991\ndamaged repairs that already had been made. Some work had to be redone, and joint projects at both facilities\nwere delayed.\nOn June 7, 1991, the prisoners filed a motion for further relief. They specifically requested that the district court\nconvert the timetable into a court order, so as to bind prison officials to the completion of all eighty-three repairs\nand upgrades by the projected dates. The prisoners also asked the district court to fine prison officials $1,000 a\nday for each day that the improvements were delayed, following a thirty-day grace period.\nThe district court heard oral argument on the motion on September 9, 1991. On September 19, the court issued a\nbrief order granting in part and denying in part the motion. Specifically, the district court approved \"the timetable\nagreed upon by\" the parties, but denied the request for prospective, automatic sanctions. The language of the\norder itself barely covers half a page, and the district court made no specific findings of fact or conclusions of law.\nOn January 27, 1992, the district court denied the defendants' motion to alter or amend the judgment. This\nappeal followed.\nII.\nThe threshold issue in this appeal is whether the parties actually \"agreed\" to the timetable for correctional\nimprovements. The plaintiffs assert that prison officials agreed to making the eighty-three improvements in\naccordance with the timetable, and that the district court approved the timetable as it appeared in the monthly\nstatus reports. Therefore, the prisoners argue, the district court had the authority to order the prison officials to\ncomply with the timetable in all of its particulars.\nWe think this view of the matter is misplaced. Even given their distinctive character as agreements backed by the\nauthority of the court, consent decrees are to be interpreted as contracts. Willie M. v. Hunt, 657 F.2d 55, 59-60\n(4th Cir.1981). The binding force of a consent decree comes from the agreement of the parties. Local Number 93,\nInt'l Ass'n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 522, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 3075, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986). A\nfederal district court may not use its power of enforcing consent decrees to enlarge or diminish the duties on\nwhich the parties have agreed and which the court has approved. See United States v. Michigan, 940 F.2d 143,\n159 (6th Cir.1991); United States v. Western Elec. Co., 894 F.2d 430, 435 (D.C.Cir.1990); Brewster v. Dukakis,\n687 F.2d 495, 497 (1st Cir.1982).\nWe see no agreement between the parties that gave the district court authority to enter the order that it did.\n1047 Maryland prison officials did not enter into a binding *1047 agreement with the prisoners to complete the eighty-\nthree repairs in accordance with the timetable during the 1990 negotiations. The negotiations following the 1990\ncontempt motion rose, at most, to the level of an arrangement to work toward an agreement. See Ramirez v.\nRivera-Dueno, 861 F.2d 328, 331 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that an agreement perceived by one party and the\ndistrict court as a binding consent decree was no more than \"an arrangement to work toward a mutually\nacceptable agreement\"). The parties compiled the list of eighty-three repairs, and the prison officials drew up a\ntimetable, as a part of the ongoing settlement discussions. A framework for settlement discussions and\nnegotiations is not to be confused, however, with the execution of a binding agreement. The most basic axiom of\ncontract law holds that an agreement is enforceable only if the parties have a meeting of the minds and all\nconditions precedent to agreement have been met. The record does not indicate that any such meeting of the\nminds occurred between these parties. The only evidence pertaining to the 1990 negotiations that was presented\nto the district court was a prison administrator's affidavit. The affidavit indicates that all parties understood\nthroughout the negotiations that the prison officials' ability to comply with the projected dates on the timetable\n[1]\nwas contingent on funding 00 funding that has never been forthcoming to the Maryland Division of Corrections.\n97\n\nIn lieu of evidence of any binding agreement concerning the timetable, the prisoners have argued to the district\ncourt, and again before this court, that it is not their practice to enter into nonbinding agreements. Plaintiffs\nmaintain that they abandoned pursuit of their 1990 contempt motion only because the officials promised to make\nrepairs in accordance with the timetable. Defendants counter that the inmates suspended litigation of their 1990\ncontempt motion for the prospect of achieving significant upgrades at MHC and MCI-H that the officials were not\nrequired, but were willing, to undertake. See Ramirez, 861 F.2d at 332-33. We need not sort through all the\naccusations regarding tactical maneuvers, however, because the fact remains that no final agreement was\nreached. Plaintiffs were well aware of how to bind prison officials to an agreement if one had been reached. The\nprocess is one that is followed in institutional litigation throughout this country. See Special Project, The Remedial\nProcess in Institutional Reform Litigation, 78 Colum.L.Rev. 784, 809-12 (1978). Indeed, the process was one that\nwas followed in this case. The parties agreed to alter several decrees from the late 1970s with both a Stipulation\nin 1983 and the Agreement in 1987. Each time, the agreements were memorialized, signed by the parties, and\nthen approved by the district court. Yet at no time in 1990 or 1991 did the parties memorialize, sign, or submit to\n[2]\nthe court any agreement about this timetable.\nA timetable developed by a party to aid ongoing settlement discussions is not automatically to be transformed\ninto a binding decree. The elevation of the timetable to the status of a binding order may well skew incentives and\n1048 hamper progress in future settlement discussions. By incorporating *1048 into an order material intended to\nassist negotiations, the district court risked disruption of a process of informal discussions between the parties\nthrough which considerable progress at MHC and MCI-H had been made. Under its approach, prison officials\nwould be far better off eschewing future negotiations and holding out for a minimalist interpretation of the 1987\nAgreement. As defendants put it, they \"could do no worse by litigating each and every complaint\" that plaintiffs\nraise. Moreover, under Fed.R.Evid. 408, the timetable would not be admissible as evidence because it was\ngenerated in the course of settlement negotiations. See Fiberglass Insulators, Inc. v. Dupuy, 856 F.2d 652, 654\n(4th Cir.1988). We deem equally inadvisable the district court's adoption of this negotiating medium for use as a\nbinding court decree.\nFinally, we are not persuaded that the timetable must be elevated to a binding order merely because progress\nunder it was dutifully communicated to the district court in monthly status reports. It is true that the reports were\n[3]\nmeticulous, apprising the court both of progress made and of work that remained to be done.  The parties gave\nno indication, however, that those status reports were submitted for court approval as a settlement to be\nincorporated as a part of the decree. Status reports that are never referred to on their face or in the court's docket\nas \"settlement agreements\" or \"consent decrees\" do not automatically become such when it suits one party's\npurposes. See Ramirez, 861 F.2d at 332 (emphasizing that a joint status report was not part of a settlement\nagreement when the report was not so labeled). A party must be able to apprise a district court of its actions in a\ngiven area without fear that every goal it strives to meet will become part of a decree. Of course, when the parties\nhave presented documents to the court that reflect the content of an agreement, and the court has given official\napproval to those terms, the commitment is a binding one. See SEC v. Levine, 881 F.2d 1165, 1180 (2d Cir.1989)\n. This did not happen here, however, and plaintiffs were not entitled to assume that the district court would\nenforce their expectations of expenditures when settlement by definition requires the assent of both negotiating\nparties. Ultimately, the question is whether a significant voluntary effort on the part of a state to improve its prison\nfacilities inevitably becomes a set of federally supervised requirements. We hold that it does not, and that the\nterms of the timetable do not constitute an addendum to the earlier consent decree.\nIII.\nBecause the terms of the timetable do not constitute an addendum to the consent decree, the 1987 Agreement\ncontinues to govern this case. The district court, of course, may interpret that Agreement and enter remedial\norders enforcing its terms. Plaintiffs contend that, if the timetable is not viewed as a separate agreement, then the\ndistrict court converted the timetable into this order to enforce immediate compliance with the 1987 Agreement.\nPlaintiffs maintain that the district court had this authority because defendants have been \"continually out of\ncompliance\" with the 1987 decree.\n1049\n\n*1049 In enforcing the 1987 Agreement, the district court has the authority to order the performance of duties\ncontained within the \"four corners\" of the consent decree. Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S.\n561, 574, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 2585, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984) (quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673,\n682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971)). We do not regard the instant order, however, as an example of\nenforcement, nor do we understand the district court to have regarded it as such. The court never indicated that\nthis was a remedial order; indeed, it never established any need to enforce the 1987 Agreement, because the\ncourt never found Maryland officials not to be in compliance with that Agreement. The abbreviated order does not\nindicate how or even whether Maryland officials might be out of compliance, and even the plaintiff class did not\noriginally seek compliance with the timetable as a means to enforce the 1987 Agreement. Rather, at oral\nargument on the motion, the inmates specified that they wanted the district court to do exactly what it did 00 treat\n97\nthe timetable as a new and binding agreement and enter it as an order.\nThe second obstacle to viewing the timetable as a simple remedial order is that it plainly imposes on prison\nofficials obligations that far exceed the requirements of the 1987 Agreement. First, the timetable mandates a\nspecific schedule within which the repairs must be completed. This forces prison officials immediately to allocate\nlarge sums of money so that they can complete significant capital upgrades within a very short time. Some of the\ndeadlines for the expensive capital improvements, such as upgrading the electrical system at MCI-H, already\nhave passed. Instead of being able to space out expenditures in relation to the availability of funds, officials may\nhave to divert funds from other pressing public needs in order to comply with the order. Such a command would\nconflict with our understanding of a consent decree as a \"future-oriented\" plan designed to achieve \"broad public\npolicy objectives.\" Plyler v. Evatt, 924 F.2d 1321, 1324 (4th Cir.1991) (citations omitted).\nFurther, the timetable calls for a range and quality of improvements not contemplated in the 1987 Agreement.\nThe Agreement calls only for general repairs in thirteen areas. The timetable mandates a broad range of eighty-\nthree items that includes significant upgrades, not merely repairs, in lighting, electrical, plumbing, and ventilation\nsystems. Where the 1987 Agreement calls for repairing inoperable plumbing, the timetable provides for new\nsupply, steam, and sewer lines. Where the Agreement contemplates a minimum requirement for circulating air in\nthe summer, the timetable provides a plan for a new mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation system. No one\ndisputes the desirability of such improvements in a world of budgetary plenty; the issue is simply whether the\n1987 Agreement obligates the prison officials to make them. We think the differences between the 1987\nAgreement and the timetable are of such a magnitude that the latter cannot be enfolded into the former through\nthe simple mechanism of enforcement.\nThe dissenting opinion, however, fails to perceive the differences to be so great and considers the district court's\norder nothing more than \"a remedial measure aimed at enforcing the earlier 1987 order.\" Op. at 1053. The\ndissent insists that the timetable merely describes \"how\" the various repairs will be made, and that it imposes no\nburdens on Maryland prison officials beyond those agreed to in 1987. We believe, to the contrary, that judicially\nbinding state officials to request funds and make extensive capital upgrades by specific dates involves far more\nthan outlining \"how\" certain repairs will be undertaken. For example, the timetable not only provides for the\n\"continuing process\" of making specific repairs to inoperable plumbing, but also for upgrading MCI-H's entire\nplumbing system by installing new supply, steam, and sewer lines. While the repairs clearly were agreed to in\n1987, the upgrades and new equipment were not. Similarly, the 1987 Agreement calls for only the most general\n1050 of electrical repairs, such as repairing exposed electrical wiring, while the timetable *1050 calls for such large\ncapital projects as the upgrade of the transformer distribution system and the purchase of a new emergency\ngenerator. Prison officials later suggested, and still hope to achieve, the upgrades in these and other areas, but\nnothing in the record indicates that the officials contemplated being ordered by the courts to complete them. We\ncannot wedge such multi-million dollar capital improvements into the confines of the 1987 Agreement under the\nguise of enforcement. As Director of Facilities Maintenance Chandler points out in his affidavit, the list of eighty-\nthree improvements in the timetable \"was not limited by the specific terms of the Stipulated Agreement.\" Yet the\ndissent's position would impose upon state officials expensive obligations to which they have never agreed.\nWhile a district court may, of course, modify a consent decree to impose new duties upon a party, see Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, ___ U.S. ___, ___-___, 112 S.Ct. 748, 757-58, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), the basic\nprocedures for modification were not pursued at the trial level. Neither party submitted a Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)\nmotion seeking relief from the 1987 Agreement. To modify a consent decree to impose new obligations, a district\n\ncourt must at a minimum (1) provide specific notice that it is contemplating the imposition of obligations in\naddition to those contained in the decree; (2) allow the parties an opportunity to present relevant evidence on the\nneed for the additional obligations and the proper character of those obligations; and (3) issue specific findings\nthat support a determination that modification is warranted. See United States v. Western Elec. Co., 894 F.2d\n430, 435 & 437 n. 12 (D.C.Cir.1990). The procedures necessary to support any modification of the 1987\nAgreement were not followed in this case.\nDefendants urge us to hold that plaintiffs cannot carry their burden to support a modification in any event.\nBecause of the progress made at the facilities in the face of both a growing inmate population and the difficulties\ncreated by the 1991 prisoner disturbance, defendants contend that any modification of the 1987 Agreement\nshould lessen, rather than stiffen, their obligations. See Rufo, ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 760. Officials also\nargue that a timetable mandating eighty-three repairs when at most fourteen repairs remain to be made is not\nsuitably tailored to any changed circumstances. Id. ___ U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 763.\nBecause neither party has properly moved for modification, the issue is not before this court or ripe for us to\ndecide. We make only the settled observation that any modification of the 1987 Agreement must heed the\nSupreme Court's admonition that federal courts respect the role of states in the administration of their\ncorrectional systems. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); see also \nPlyler, 924 F.2d at 1324. This deference extends not only to internal security concerns, but also to the\ncomprehensive planning and commitment of resources that are \"peculiarly within the province of the legislative\nand executive branches of government.\" Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40\nL.Ed.2d 224 (1974); see also Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 407-08, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 1878-79, 104 L.Ed.2d\n459 (1989). The Supreme Court has recently emphasized that such deference is appropriate when modifying\nconsent decrees in institutional reform litigation, and that any decision on modification should take into account\nthe greater public interest and the \"legitimate concern\" of state \"financial constraints.\" Rufo, ___ U.S. at ___, 112\nS.Ct. at 764.\nIV.\nWe recognize that the process of administering a consent decree often taxes the patience of all who are involved\nwith it. Plaintiffs almost invariably believe that progress is neither prompt nor complete, and defendants are often\nvexed by seemingly endless demands for more expenditures. The monitoring process for district courts is likely to\n1051 be a difficult one. Fortunately, the instant case is one where progress has been and will continue to be made. \n*1051 The authority of law, however, was not properly invoked to impose upon Maryland officials the particular\ntimetable which plaintiffs seek in this case. For the reasons stated above, we must reverse the judgment of the\ndistrict court and remand this case with instructions to deny plaintiffs' June 1991 motion for further relief.\nREVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\nK.K. HALL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nMy disagreement with the majority stems from our differing views regarding what the order on appeal actually\ndoes. The timetable does not \"go well beyond the general requirements of the 1987 Agreement.\" Op. at 1045.\nThe defendants concede that \"[t]he parties' expectation was that when the 83 items were corrected, the parties\nwould agree that the institutions were in compliance with the 1987 Agreement's provision.\" Appellant's brief 9. In\n\"approving\" the timetable, the district court did no more than recognize that the specific corrective actions agreed\nupon by the parties were an adequate response to the agreement reached four years earlier.\nI.\nIn opposing the inmates' motion below, the defendants contended that the timetable \"vastly expand[ed] the scope\nof the [1987] Stipulated Agreement.\" In neither their pleadings below nor their brief to this court, however, did the\ndefendants explain how their obligations are expanded. The majority, however, gives four examples of this\n\npurported expansion. See op. 1046, 1049. A detailed examination of each example refutes this threshold premise\nof the majority's opinion.\nA.\nThe majority contrasts the 1987 Agreement's requirement of \"only twenty foot-candles of lighting in living, work,\nacademic, and library areas\" with the 1990 timetable's \"require[ment of] the installation of contractor-supplied,\ntamper-proof, fluorescent light fixtures throughout MHC.\" Op. 1045. In the six-column timetable itself, the first\ncolumn (\"DEFICIENCY\") reads: \"Correction of the lighting by fluorescent fixtures (this is what we agreed at the\nmeeting).\" After years of waiting for \"twenty foot-candles of lighting in all living, work, academic, and library\"\n(which is pretty much the same as saying \"throughout the prison\"), the parties simply specified how this\ndeficiency was to be corrected. The timetable does not require \"contractor-supplied tamper-proof\" fixtures;\ncolumn six of the timetable (\"Status as of 15 December 1990\") contains the following note: \"Installation of\nFluorescent fixtures Started by In-house staff. Prototype selected after several test[s] to insure tamper proof\nenclosures.\" The requirement is still to provide adequate lighting. In 1987, the requirement was \"20 foot-candles\";\nsome years later, the parties agreed (at least with regard to one prison) to install fluorescent lighting. That a\ncontractor is supplying tamper-proof fixtures merely describes how the defendants have chosen to correct the\nlighting deficiency.\nB.\nThe second example of the purported \"radical expansion\" of obligations is the timetable's provision for \"a\ncomplete electrical upgrade project at MCI-H, including improvement of the transformer distribution system and\ninstallation of a new emergency generator.\" Op. 1045. Again, the language of the timetable itself paints a different\npicture. The related deficiency listed in column one is \"[r]epair of overloaded electrical outlets.\" This deficiency is\nclearly within the ambit of the following requirement of the 1987 Agreement (which was subject to immediate\ncorrection): \"7. The correction of all fire safety deficiencies outlined by the State Fire Marshal. The defendants\nshall comply with the requirements of the NFPA Code for correctional institutions adopted by the Maryland\nDepartment of Public Safety and Correctional Services.\" The third column of the timetable (\"CORRECTIVE\n1052 ACTION REQUIRED\") notes that \"Phase II of an electrical *1052 upgrade project will correct these deficiencies\nat MCI-H ... Phase I is design, including upgrade of the transformer distribution system and purchase of new\nemergency generator needed to implement phase II. Phase II is construction of phase I items, ... contingent upon\n[1]\nfunding approval.\"  I am unable to see how this imposes any new obligations on the defendants. In 1987, they\nagreed to immediately correct all fire safety deficiencies, and \"overloaded electrical outlets\" certainly qualifies as\na fire safety deficiency. How the defendants intend to go about correcting this aspect of the overall fire-safety\nproblem does not expand the state's obligations.\nC.\nAs for plumbing, the 1987 Agreement requires the defendants to \"repair all inoperable plumbing.\" In the\n\"DEFICIENCY\" column in the MHC section of the timetable is the following: \"Repair of inoperable plumbing in the\nmain institution.\" Under \"CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUIRED,\" the report reads: \"Daily plumbing inspection logs\nare made. Deficiencies from these logs are required [sic] as soon as possible. This is a continuing process. A\nplumbing upgrade project to replace supply lines, steam lines, sewer lines and renovate shower areas, will be\nsubmitted in the FY 93 capital request.\" The \"COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE\" column reads: \"Phase I (Design)\ncontingent upon approval of funding, would be awarded 1/92. Completion would occur 2/93. If Funding is\nApproved, a Design Award, could be made by 12/91.\" Again, the deficiency addressed in the timetable is no\nbroader than the express terms of the 1987 Agreement: repair inoperable plumbing. The timetable merely\nestablishes what plumbing needs to be repaired and how (again, contingent on funding) the defendants hope to\nremedy the problem.\n\nD.\nFinally, the majority contrasts the 1987 Agreement's specification of minimum air circulation requirements for 5ยฝ\n[2]\nmonths of the year  with the timetable's provision that the defendants would seek funding for a $350,000\nventilation system at MCI-H. The precise wording of the deficiency listed in the timetable is as follows:\n\"Development of a system (however to be done) to take care of the air exchange requirements in the main\ninstitution [at MCI-H].\" As with the planned electrical and plumbing upgrades, the chosen \"corrective action\" is\nmade \"contingent upon funding approval.\" The \"air exchange requirements\" are no doubt those established by\nthe specific terms of the 1987 Agreement. The parenthetical phrase \"(however to be done)\" suggests that the\ndefendants decided that a $350,000 ventilation project was the way to go to meet the requirements.\nII.\nThe majority's fears that the timetable would \"mandate[] a specific schedule within which the repairs must be\ncompleted\" and that \"officials may have to divert funds from other pressing needs in order to comply with the\norder\" are simply overstated. Op. 1049. Under the \"CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUIRED\" column, the matter of\nfunding takes one of three basic forms: (1) no funding needed, e.g. work to be done by in-house maintenance\nstaff (approximately 45-50 items; see n. 3, infra); (2) funding has been or will be requested (approximately 5-10\nitems); and (3) funds have been earmarked already in the then-current budget (which was the FY 1992 budget\nunder the December 15, 1991 timetable that was \"approved\" by the court) (approximately 25-30 items).\n1053 According to the appellants, only 14 items remain uncompleted. I assume that *1053 these comprise (1) items\nthat are presently incomplete but for which funding is available, and (2) items for which funding has been\nrequested but has not been approved. I do not interpret the timetable to require diversion of funds to the latter\ngroup. The timetable includes what needs to be done, how such work is to be accomplished, and where the\nmoney to do it is to come from. The \"contingent-on-funding\" disclaimers were not added unilaterally by the\ndefendants; they are integral parts of the timetable agreement. If funding is requested but not received, I cannot\nimagine that contempt would lie.\nIII.\nBuilding from the premise that the timetable vastly expanded the defendants' duties, the majority characterizes\nthe timetable as \"[a] framework for settlement discussions and negotiations\" rather than a binding agreement.\nOp. 1047. As I have explained above, the timetable does not expand the obligations of the 1987 Agreement; it is,\nrather, \"a detailed implementation plan designed to eliminate possible sources of continued non-compliance....\" \nClass v. Norton, 505 F.2d 123, 125 (2d Cir.1973). Once the scope of the timetable is seen in this light, I find it\nreadily apparent that the court's approval order is primarily a remedial measure aimed at enforcing the earlier\n1987 order. There should be no question that the defendants \"agreed\" to the provisions in the timetable, at least\nin the sense that they believed that the deficiencies listed needed to be corrected and that the corrective actions\nlisted were the best means available. The question posed by the majority, however, is whether or not the\ndefendants agreed to have this timetable agreement made an order of the court. See op. 1046 (\"We see no\nagreement between the parties that gave the district court authority to enter the order that it did.\") The district\ncourt, however, only needed such conferred authority to modify the 1987 Agreement. As it is, the court's approval\norder merely enforces what had been in effect for some four years.\nIV.\n\"In shaping equity decrees, the trial court is vested with broad discretionary power; appellate review is\ncorrespondingly narrow.... Moreover, in constitutional adjudication as elsewhere, equitable remedies are a special\nblend of what is necessary, what is fair, and what is workable.\" Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U.S. 192, 200, 93 S.Ct.\n1463, 1469, 36 L.Ed.2d 151 (1973) (citation and footnote omitted). The court-approved timetable is such a blend.\n\nThis case was filed in 1977. Ten years later, the parties agreed on rather broadly worded goals to bring the prison\nup to constitutional standards. In 1990, after three years of waiting on the \"immediate correction\" of \"all\nenvironmental deficiencies,\" the inmates decided to press the issue and request that the defendants be held in\n[3]\ncontempt. The defendants then sat down with the inmates and hammered out an 83-item  list of deficiencies,\nspecific corrective action, and a schedule for completion. The broad but somewhat amorphous goals of 1987 took\non a workable form, and a possible contempt finding was forestalled. Most corrective actions, particularly those\nrequiring large expenditures of state funds, are made contingent on funding approval. Because I do not see how\nthe timetable does anything more than state how and when the defendants intend to meet the obligations that\nthey assumed (by agreement reduced to court order) in 1987, I believe that the timetable does not \"modify\" the\n1987 Agreement.\nI would affirm the district court.\n[1] In his uncontested affidavit, Charles Chandler, Director of Facilities Maintenance for the Maryland Department\nof Public Safety and Correctional Services, states, \"I made it very clear, and I believed all parties understood, that\nour ability to address many of the concerns would depend on funding. Obviously funding and the performance by\ncontractors will have major impacts in determining the actual date of completion of some corrective action.\"\n[2] Plaintiffs make much of the defendants' use of the word \"agreed\" in this sentence from their brief: \"Rather than\nexpend resources in litigation or extensive negotiations leading to modification of the 1987 Agreement, the\nprisoners' experts and DOC officials identified a list of items at MHC and MCI-H for which improvements were\ndesirable or necessary and which the State agreed to undertake.\" When the sentence is read in context, it is\nclear that the defendants meant that they would try to complete the improvements, not that they considered\nthemselves legally bound to do so. The paragraph in defendants' brief goes on to point out that settlement\ndiscussions remained \"ongoing,\" that negotiations \"were never formalized,\" and that any projected dates \"were\nnever intended to be binding.\"\n[3] For example, one timetable entry reads: \nDeficiency: Repair of overloaded electrical outlets.\n. . . . .\nCorrective Action Required: Phase II of an electrical upgrade project will correct these deficiencies at MCI-H.\nPhase II (FY 92 Fund Request) is scheduled to be awarded 1/92. Phase I is design, including upgrade of the\ntransformer distribution system and purchase of new emergency generator needed to implement phase II. Phase\nII is construction of phase I items and installation of outlets and new lighting, contingent upon funding approval.\nCompliance Schedule: Design Phase I starts, 1/91. Scheduled completion, 9/91. Phase II scheduled to start 1/92,\ncontingent upon approval of FY 92 capital funding.\n. . . . .\nStatus As of 30 July 1991: Phase I design in progress. Phase II design funding approved. Cost of this project may\nincrease and design and construction delayed because of damage and uncertainties from May 1991 inmate\nuprising.\n[1] The May 15, 1991, timetable report notes as follows: \"Phase I to start 4/91. Completion by 12/91. Phase II\ndesign funds approved in FY 92 budget. Phase I construction to start after 1/92.\"\n[2] The 1987 Agreement also required that the \"defendants shall investigate other methods for increasing the air\nmovement [to certain levels] ... submit a plan to the Court by September 1, 1987.\" I am unable to determine from\nthe record whether such a plan was ever submitted.\n[3] Eighty-three items is not as daunting as it sounds. By my count, more than half of the items were to be\ncompleted by \"in-house maintenance staff,\" with no expenditure of funds noted, e.g. cutting and capping all dead\n\nelectrical wiring in living areas; conduct monthly fire drills with inmate participation. Another 25-30 items had (as\nearly as December, 1990) funds earmarked. Funding appeared to be a problem with fewer than ten items, albeit\nmost of the major ones.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
