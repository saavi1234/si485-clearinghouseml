    "summary": "<p>This was a class-action prisoner lawsuit filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  Plaintiffs were Missouri prisoners who were transferred from Missouri state-penal institutions to jails in Texas pursuant to the \"Texas Cell Lease Program,\" a contract between the Missouri Department of Corrections [DOC] and several Texas counties and a city whereby the Texas entities agreed to house and supervise the Missouri prisoners in exchange for money.  The Texas Cell Lease Program was operational in 1995 through 1997.</p><p>Plaintiffs alleged violations of their constitutional rights due to a wide range of conduct including beatings, dog attacks, rapes, and poor conditions of confinement.</p><p>The litigation began after the public release of a videotape of an incident that occurred on September 18, 1996, at the Brazoria County Jail, Texas.  The video showed non-resistant prisoners being subjected to stun guns, tear gas, physical abuse, body cavity searches and an attack by a German Shepherd.  See Kesler v. King, 29 F.Supp.2d 356 (S.D.Tex.1998) (describing the occurrence in the Brazoria County Jail).  Correctional officers captured on the video were employees of Brazoria County and Capitol Corrections Resources, Inc. (\"CCRI\"), a private jail company.  A federal criminal investigation ensured and was followed by a flood of over 700 inmate lawsuits in state and federal courts in Missouri and Texas.</p><p>Eventually, many of the cases were consolidated for purposes of discovery and pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  Judge Scott O. Wright initially presided over the cases, until they were transferred to Judge Nanette K. Laughrey.  A large number of plaintiffs were represented by a group of private attorneys in Missouri.  </p><p>Protracted discovery and litigation followed.  Brazoria County moved to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, but the motion was denied by the District Court (Judge Laughrey).  In Re Texas Prison Litigation, 41 F.Supp.2d 960 (W.D.Mo. 1999).  The DOC initially took a hard-line stance in the litigation, advising the parties and the Court that it intended to depose every prisoner in the case and that it would not pay any monies towards settlement.  Despite the DOC position, the parties engaged in mediation and eventually a reached a tentative settlement.</p><p>On July 20, 1999, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in one of the consolidated cases and subsequently filed a joint motion for conditional certification of a settlement class and a joint motion for approval of the settlement.  The Class Complaint sought equitable relief, actual, compensatory, and punitive damages, as well as reasonable attorney fees and costs. The District Court conditionally certified the class to address all claims arising out of the Texas Cell Lease Program on July 29, 1999.  A fairness hearing was held on December 3, 1999. </p><p>On January 14, 2000, the District Court approved the Settlement Agreement.  The Agreement as modified by the Court called for the payment of $2.2 million by the defendants, with $800,000 being allocated to class counsel and $300,000 for expenses.  The remainder was to be divided among three groups of class members according to the nature and severity of their claims.  The Agreement contained injunctive relief in the form of limitations to when and under what conditions Missouri prisoners could be transferred out of state and a DOC provision for redressing conduct violations unfairly imposed while the class members were in Texas.  The DOC was also enjoined from confiscating all of the monetary relief afforded to the inmates as reimbursement for costs of incarceration pursuant to the Missouri Reimbursement Incarceration Act, §§ 217.825, R.S.Mo.  In Re Texas Prison Litigation, 191 F.R.D. 164 (W.D.Mo. 2000).</p>",

In  July  of  1983,  Missouri  Attorney  General  John  Ashcroft  wrote  Opinion \nNo.  83-93  holding  that  MDOC  may  not  legally  contract  out  the  operation  of  adult \ncorrectional  facilities  to  private  prison  companies  under  Missouri  law. \n43.  Between  1993  and  1997,  the  Missouri  defendants  developed  and \nparticipated  in  the  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program  by  which  MDOC  contracted  out  the \noperation  of  adult  correctional  facilities  to  private  prison  companies  through  the  use \nof  contracts  with  Texas  municipal  entities  named  above  and  subcontracts  with  the \nprivate  prison  companies. \n44.  The  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program  was  in  violation  of  Missouri  law,  and  was \na  concerted  effort,  conspiracy  and  meeting  of  the  minds  among  defendants  to \ndrcumvent  the  holding  in  Opinion  No.  83-93. \n45.  In  the  summer  of  1996,  defendant  Brazoria  County,  Texas  retained  James \nP.  Brewer  to  act  as  its  agent  to  negotiate  a  contract  for  the  housing  and  confinement  of \nplaintiffs  and  other  inmates  at  the  Brazoria  County  Correctional  Center  as  part  of  the \nTexas  Cell  Lease  Program.\neft  Carison  and  Hellmann  314-583-8300  Waa)  “24799  CY  7:294M  DN  isveg \n-_ \n46.

On  August  27,  1996,  the  State  of  Missouri  and  defendant  Brazoria  County, \nTexas  entered  into  the  contract,  Exhibit  A,  which  had  been  negotiated  by  Brewer. \n48.  Defendant  Brazoria  County,  Texas  entered  into  a  subcontract  with \ndefendant  CCRI  to  fulfill  the  obligations  of  defendant  Brazoria  County,  Texas  under \nthe  contract. \n49.  Defendant  Gregg  County,  Texas,  and  all  the  Texas  governmental  entities \nidentified  herein  similarly  entered  into  contracts  with  the  State  of  Missouri  and  the \nMissourl  defendants  and  also  entered  into  subcontracts  with  one  or  more  of \ndefendants  Capitol  Correctional  Resources,  Inc.,  Dove  Development  Corp. and  The \nBobby  Ross  Group,  Inc.  for  the  housing  of  Missouri  inmates  under  the  Texas  Cell \nLease  Program,  in  circumvention  of  Missouri  law,  and  such  conduct  was  a  concerted \neffort,  conspiracy  and  meeting  of  the  minds  among  defendants  to  circumvent  the \nholding  in  Opinion  No.  83-93. \n50.

At  all  times  mentioned  herein,  the  guards  who  transported  plaintiffs  and \nall  class  members  to,  between  and  from  the  Texas  jail  facilities  were  the  agents  of  all \ndefendants  herein,  acting  within  the  course  and  scope  of  such  agency.\ncf)  Carison  and  Hellmann  314-583-8300  W4aj  6/24/99  7:29  AM  L  16/68 \n(> \n52.  At  all  times  mentioned  herein,  the  guards  at  the  lexas  jail  facilities  were \nthe  agents  of  their  respective  Texas  governmental  entity,  their  respective  sheriff  and \nCCRI  or  another  private  prison  company,  acting  within  the  course  and  scope  of  such \nagency. \n53.  Throughout  the  relevant  period,  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  were \ninvoluntarily  transferred  and  transported  by  defendants,  without  warning,  from  the \nState  of  Missouri  to  the  State  of  Texas  pursuant  to  the  contracts  entered  into  by  and \nbetween  the  various  defendants. \n54.  The  transport  of  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  from  the  State  of \nMissouri  to  the  State  of  Texas  was  undertaken  by  the  defendants  in  order  to  enhance \nand  perfect  the  financial  interests  of  the  defendants. \n55.  Some  of  the  plaintiffs  and  class  members  were  involuntarily  and  illegally \ntransferred  by  MDOC  and  defendants  from  the  State  of  Missouri  to  the  Texas  jail \nfacilities  as  improper  punishment  for  alleged,  imagined,  non-existent  or  real \ntransgressions  and  infractions  allegedly  committed  while  incarcerated  in  the  State  of \nMissouri. \n56.  Some  of  the  plaintiffs  and  class  members  were  improperly  and  illegally \ntransported  from  the  State  of  Missouri  to  the  Texas  jail  facilities  only  after  their \ninmate  security  classifications  were  improperly  and  illegally  changed  by  order  of \ndefendant  Schriro  in  conspiracy  with  other  defendants  in  order  to  “dump”  more \nviolent  offenders  in  the  Texas  jail  facilities,  in  direct  contravention  of  the  contracts \nbetween  the  various  defendants,  and  in  contravention  of  the  third  party  beneficiary \ncontract  rights  of  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members.\nCf]  Carison  and  Hetimann  314-583-8300  Aaj  6724799  (4)  7:29  AM  Q)  17768 \n4  ( 7  * \n57.

On  information  and  belief,  some  MDOC  employees  argued  with \ndefendant  Schriro  that  her  actlons  were  improper,  ill  advised  and  wrong,  however, \ndefendant  Schriro  told  them  to  do  it  anyhow. \n59.  Defendant  Schriro  knew  that  by  reclassifying  more  violent  offenders \nfrom  level  4  and  5  status  to  level  2,  3  and  4  status,  the  more  violent  offenders  would  be \nhoused  in  the  same  cells  and  tanks  with  less  violent  level  2  and  3  inmates,  thereby \nsubjecting  the  level  2  and  3  inmates,  including  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members,  to \nincreased  incidence  and  risk  of  violence,  bodily  harm,  and  fear  for  their  personal \nsafety.  | \n60.  In  furtherance  of  their  conspiracy,  the  Missouri  defendants  then \nwithheld  from  the  Texas  defendants  information  that  inmate  classifications  had  been \ndeliberately  and  illegally  changed  in  violation  of  the  aforesaid  contracts  and  sub- \ncontracts  between  defendants,  and  in  violation  of  the  constitutional  rights  and  the \nthird  party  beneficiary  contract  rights  of  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members,  as  more  fully \ndescribed  herein. \n61.

The  illegal  reclassification  of  plaintiffs  and  class  members  by  the  Missouri \ndefendants  was  arbitrary,  capricious,  and  in  excess  of  statutory  authority  in  that  the \nMissouri  defendants  violated  Missouri  Statutes  and  the  standard  operating  procedure \nfor  classification  of  offenders  as  set  forth  in  Missourl  Department  of  Corrections \nInstitutional  Services  Policies  and  Procedures. \n63.  Plaintiffs  and  class  members  were  assaulted,  battered,  shackled  and \nhandcuffed  by  defendants  or  their  agents,  acting  within  the  scope  of  their  agency, \nwhile  they  were  still  in  the  State  of  Missourl;  they  were  forced  to  use  a  bucket  in  the \naisle  of  the  bus  as  toilet  facilites  on  trips  lasting  18-22  hours;  and  they  were  denied \nadequate  food  and  nutrition.  | \n64.  Upon  transfer,  and  immediately  upon  disembarking  from  the  transport \nbuses  at  the  Brazoria  County  Correctional  Center,  the  first  group  of  plaintiffs  and  class \nmembers  was  met  by  agents  of  defendants  Brazoria  County,  Texas,  CCRI  and  the \nMissouri  defendants,  who  were  outfitted  in  riot  gear,  helmets,  batons,  stun  guns,  and \nguard  dogs  and  who  began  to  threaten such  plaintiffs  and  class  members  with \nviolence. \n65.

After  his  release  from  jail  or  prison,  defendants  CCRI,  Brazoria,  and  the \nMissouri  defendants  hired  Wallace  as  a  prison/jail  guard. \n69.

From  the  time  they  were  forced  to  board  buses  in  the  State  of  Missouri  for \ntransport  to  the  Texas  jail  facilitles  under  the  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program,  including  but \nnot  limited  to  defendants  Brazoria  County  and  Gregg  County,  until  their  eventual \nreturn  to  the  State  of  Missouri,  plaintiffs  and  class  members  were,  by  all  defendants \nand  their  agents,  tortured,  abused,  subjected  to  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  and \nwere  subjected  to  other  violations  of  their  rights  under  the  First,  Fourth,  Fifth,  Sixth, \nEighth,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  and \nwere  subjected  to  violations  of their  third  party  beneficiary  contract rights  by \ndefendants  and  their  agents  in  the  following  respects: \n(a)  they  were  physically  assaulted  and  battered; \n(b)  they  were  repeatedly  punched  and  kicked; \n(c)  they  were  forced  to  remove  all  of  their  clothing  and  then  crawl  on \ntheir  stomachs  from  their  cell  to  the  hallway  while  nude; \n(d)  they  were  terrorized  and  humiliated; \n(e)  they  were  slammed  into  the  walls  of  the  jail  facility;\n(f)  they  were  thrown  to  the  ground  and  floor; \n(g)  they  were  subjected  to  mace  and  other  chemical  agents  without \ncause; \n(h)  their  personal  property  was  intentionally  stolen  and  destroyed; \n(1)  their  requests  for  medical  treatment  for  their  injuries  and  illnesses \nwere  ignored  and  denied; \n(j)  they  were  administered  psychotropic  drugs  and  medications  such \nas  Elavil  without  a  reasonable  and  necessary  medical  indication  to  warrant  the \nadministration  of  such  drugs; \n(k)  they  were  confined  with  Level  4  and  5  inmates  in  violation  of  the \ncontracts  and  Missouri  law; \n(1)  their  complaints  to  all  defendants  herein  and  their  agents  were \nignored; \n(m)  they were  threatened  with  death  and  asked  if  they  “wanted  to  see \nthe  graveyard”; \n(n)  they  were  discriminated  against  because  they  were  from  Missourl \nin  that  they  were  forced  to  scream  “I  love  Texas”  and  other  such  statements \nunder  threat  of  physical  force  and  punishment; \n(0)  they  were  denied  access  to  the  press,  to  family  members  and  to  the \noutside  world  to  whom  they  sought  to  fully  reveal  the  nature  of  the  violations \nbeing  visited  upon  them  by  defendants; \n(p)  they  were  placed  in  punitive  confinement  in  the  “hole”  without \njust  cause;\n(C \n(q)  they  were  denied  access  to  the  courts  and  counsel  in  that  they  were \ndenied  reasonable  access  to  Missouri  law  books  and  an  adequate  legal  lbrary; \n(r)  their  access  to  courts  and  counsel  were  denied,  hindered  and \ninterfered  with  in  that  the  defendants  failed  to  return  to  them  their  possessions, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to,  legal  papers,  research,  personal  belongings  and \nother  tangible  things; \n(s)  they  were  denied  adequate  meals  and  nourishment  in  violation  of \nthe  contract  between  the  State  of  Missouri  and  the  Texas  governmental  entities \nnamed  above,  and  in  violation  of  the  third  party  beneficiary  rights  of  plaintiffs \nand  other  class  members; \n(t)  they  were  unjustly  confined  to  their  cells  and  denied  exercise; \n(u)  plaintiffs  and  other  class  members,  many  of  whom  are  of  African- \nAmerican  descent,  were  victims  of  racial  discrimination,  subject  to  racial  slurs \nand  derogatory  comments  and  treatment,  further  white  prisoners  who \nassociated  with  or  who  befriended  African-American  prisoners  were  victims  of \ndiscrimination,  slurs  and  derogatory  comments  and  treatment; \n(v)  when  they  complained  about  their  treatment  in  the  Texas  jail \nfacilities  under  the  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program  to  relatives,  friends  and  to \ndefendant  Schriro  and  other  defendants,  threats  were  made  to  further  cut  off \ntheir  access  to  the  outside  world  by  removing  their  inmate  telephones;  and, \n(w)  during  their  transport  out  of  the  State  of  Missouri  by  defendants \nthey  were  handcuffed  and  shackled  for  trips  lasting  18-22  hours,  were  denied\n(—  | \nadequate  food  and  were  forced  to  use  toilet  facilities  which  consisted  of  buckets \nplaced  in  the  aisle  of  the  transport  buses. \n82.  All  class  members  became  aware  of  the  notorious,  abusive  and  violative \nconditions,  practices  and  treatment  in  the  jail  facilities  of  defendants  Brazoria  County \nand  Gregg  County,  and  in  all  of the  Texas  jail  facilities  under  the  Texas  Cell  Lease \nProgram,  and  were  thereby  caused  to  live  in  fear  of  being  transported  to  those  jail \nfacilities.  All  class  members  continue  to  this  day  to  live  in  fear  that  they  may  be \ntransported  by  defendants  to  the  jail  facilities  of  defendants  Brazoria  County  and  Gregg \nCounty,  and  all  of  the  Texas  jail  facilitles  under  the  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program \n83.  From  September  of  1996  until  August  of  1997,  plaintiffs  and  class \nmembers  continued  to  make  repeated  complaints,  orally  and  in  writing,  to  defendant \nSchriro  and  the  other  defendants,  that  they  were  being  tortured,  abused  and  subjected \nto cruel and  unusual  punishment  and  the  other  constitutional  and  contract  violations \ndescribed  above.  Their  complaints  were  ignored  and  they  were  threatened  by \ndefendants  or  their  agents  with  retaliation  if  they  persisted  in  making  complaints. \n84.  At  various  times  between  September  of  1996  and  August  of  1997, \nplaintiffs’  and  class  members’  family  members  and  friends  made  repeated  complaints, \norally  and  in  writing,  to  defendant  Schriro  and  other  defendants  that  plaintiffs  and \nclass  members  were  being  tortured,  abused  and  subjected  to  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment  and  the  other  constitutional  and  contract  violations  described  above  by \ndefendants  and  their  agents.  Their  complaints  were  ignored. \n85.  At  various  times  between  September  of  1996  and  August  of  1997, \nmembers  of  the  United  States  Congress  and/or  the  Missouri  Legislature  advised\ndefendant  Schriro  that  they  had  been  receiving  complaints  from  family  members  of \nplaintiffs  and  class  members.  Defendant  Schriro  took  no  action. \n86.  At  various  ttmes  between  September  of  1996  and  August  of  1997, \nnumerous  Missouri  inmates  filed  lawsuits  contesting  the  conditions  of  their \nconfinement  and  the  abuses  they  received  at  the  hands  of  the  defendants. \n87.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  the \nState  of  Missouri  conducted  an  inquiry  in  response  to  the  lawsuits  filed  by  inmates \nagainst  defendant  Schriro. \n88.  Despite  all  of  the  warnings,  protests,  lawsuits  and  the  report  defendant \nAllan  received  on  September  19,  1996,  about  the  September  18,  1996  incident,  the \nMissouri  defendants  refused  to act  to  protect  plaintiffs  and  class  members  from  abuse \nand  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  at  the  hands  of  the  defendants.  The  Missouri \ndefendants  instead  threatened  plaintiffs  and  class  members  with  retaliatory  action  if \nthey  continued  their  complaints. \n89.  Notwithstanding  the  inquiries  from  members  of  the  United  States \nCongress  and/or  the  Missouri!  Legislature  and  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  the \nState  of  Missouri,  defendant  Schriro  refused  to  order  the  return  of  the  plaintiffs  and \nclass  members  to  the  State  of  Missouri,  and  continued  to  transfer  more  class  members \nto  the  Texas  facilities. \n90.  In  August  of  1997,  a  videotape  was  released  to  the  public  showing  the \ntorture,  abuse  and  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  inflicted  upon  the  first  group  of \nclass  members  by  the  defendants  at  the  Brazoria  County  Correctional  Center  on  or \nabout  September  18,  1996.\n91.  When  the  general  public  learned  about  the  conditions  in  the  Texas  jail \nfacilities  under  the  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program,  defendant  Schriro  then  immediately \ncanceled  the  contract  with  Brazoria  County,  feigned  ignorance  of  the  situation,  and \nordered  that  all  of  the  Missouri  inmates  were  to  be  immediately  returned  to  the  State \nof  Missouri. \n92.  Plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  were  by  defendants  intentionally \ndenied  the  right  to  file  effective  grievances  concerning  the  allegations  of  this \nComplaint  while  in  the  Texas  jail  facilities  under  the  Texas  Cell  Lease \nProgram.  Plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  were,  by  defendants,  under  threat \nof  terror  and  death  for  exposing  the  conditions  within  the  Texas  jail  facilities. \n93.  During  the  relevant  period,  both  while  in  the  Texas  jail  facilities \nunder  the  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program,  and  while  being  transported  to,  from  and \nbetween  said  facilities,  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  were  by  defendants \nsubjected  to  23  hour  per  day  lock  down,  an  inhumane  food  diet,  inhumane \nmedical  care,  daily  threats,  dented  access  to  legal  materials  and  mail,  denied \ngrievance  procedures  to  bring  these  matters  of  life  and  death  to  the  attention \nof  human  rights  agencies  or  legal  assistance,  denied  hygiene  and  basic \nminimal  cleaning  materials  and  were  forced  to  buy  from  the  company  store \nsuch  items  as  were  necessary  for  health  and  safety,  and  were  subjected  to \nthreats  of  death  and  physical  harm. \n94.  Plaintiffs  Phillip  Johnson,  Shawn  Armstrong,  Joseph  Cornejo, \nNeely  Milner,  Gerald  Farrrell,  Keenon  Giles,  and  Brent  Murphy  and  all  class \nmembers,  during  their  transportation  to  from  and  between  the  Texas  jail\nfacilities  by  defendant  Transcor  and  the  other  defendants,  and  during  their \nincarceration  in  the  Texas  jail  facilities  in  Brazoria  County,  Texas,  Gregg \nCounty,  Texas,  Navarro  County,  Texas,  Frio  County,  Texas,  Newton  County, \nTexas,  Limestone  County,  Texas,  and  Zavalla  County  and  Crystal  City  ,  Texas \nby  those  Texas  government  entities,  defendants  Capitol  Correctional \nResources,  Inc.,  Dove  Development  Corp.  and  The  Bobby  Ross  Group,  Inc., \nand  defendants  Schriro  and  Allan,  were  caused  by  those  defendants  to  suffer \nintentional  physical  injury,  assault,  battery,  beatings,  dog  attacks,  cattle-prod, \ntazer  and  other  electronic  shockings,  chemical  macings,  gassings,  torture, \nabuse,  cruel  and  unusual  punishment,  threats  intimidation,  racial  epithets \nand  discrimination,  denial  of  proper  and  adequate  medical  care,  denial  of \naccess  to  counsel,  to  the  courts  and  to  legal  resources  and  materials,  denial  of \nadequate  meals  and  nutrition,  denial  of  adequate  hygienic  facilities  and \nmaterials,  denial  of  free  speech,  destruction  and  denial  of  their  personal \nbelongings,  false  conduct  violations,  improper  security  classifications, \nimproper  confinement  with  more  violent  offenders,  improper  and \nunwarranted  punitive  administrative  segregation,  denial  of  access  to  the \npress,  denial  of  free  speech,  denial  of  an  adequate  grievance  process,  and  other \nviolations  by  defendants  of  rights  secured  to  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members \nby  the  First,  Fourth,  Fifth,  Sixth,  Eighth,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments \nof  the  United  States  Constitution,  and  the  third  party  beneficiary  contract \nrights  of  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members. \n \nc \n95.  Throughout  the  entire  relevant  period  defendants  had  the  responsibility \nand  obligation  to  supervise  and  control  the  acts  of  the  guards,  transportatlon \npersonnel,  and  all  staff  and  other  agents  in  connection  with  the  Texas  jail  facilities; \nhowever,  they  failed  to  do  so. \n96.  Defendants  recelved  numerous  complaints  from  plaintiffs  and  class \nmembers,  plaintiffs’  and  class  members’  family  and  friends  about  the  torture,  abuse, \ncruel  and  unusual  punishment  and  other  constitutional  violations  enumerated  more \nfully  hereinabove  being  inflicted  upon  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members;  however, \ndefendants  ignored  the  complaints  and  refused  to  investigate  them. \n97.  Defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  torture,  abuse,  cruel  and \nunusual  punishment  and  other  constitutional  violations  being  inflicted  upon \nplaintiffs  and  all  class  members;  however  defendants  deliberately  refused  to  establish \nand  implement  policies,  practices  and  procedures  to  protect  plaintiffs  and  all  class \nmembers. \n98.  The  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  and  other  constitutional  violations \nbeing  inflicted  upon  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  was  a  persistent  and  widespread \npractice  of  private  transportation  companies  and  of  private  prison  companies  in  the \nState  of  Texas,  and  was  so  common  and  well  settled  as  to  constitute  a  custom \nrepresenting  official  policy  on  the  part  of  these  defendants. \n99.  The  actions  and  omissions  of  defendants  were  committed  under  color  of \nstate  law  and  pursuant  to  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  used  with  respect  to  the \ntransportation  of  Missouri  inmates  to  from  and  between  the  Texas  jail  facilities.\n100.  The  actions  and  omissions  of  defendants  constitute  violations  of  the  Ku \nKlux  Klan  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  et  seq.,  and  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  are \ntherefore  entitled  under  the  Ku  Klux  Klan  Act  to  equitable  relief,  damages  and  the \nrecovery  of  litigation  costs,  including  reasonable  attorneys’  fees  and  expert  witness  fees \npursuant  to  §  1988  thereof. \n101.  The  actions  and  omissions  of  defendants  were  willful,  wanton  and \nmalicious. \n102.  Asa  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  custom  and  practice  adopted  by \nthese  defendants,  and  as  a  direct  and proximate  result  of  the  individual  specific  acts  by \ndefendants,  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  were  deprived  of  their  civil  rights  and \n|  liberties  in  violation  of  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  the  Constitution  of  the \nState  of  Missouri,  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  et  seq.  in  that  plaintiffs  were: \n(a)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  be  secure  in  thelr  persons,  papers  and \neffects; \n(6)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  personal  safety  and  freedom  from \nexcessive  force  and  cruel  and  unusual  punishment; \n(c)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  due  process  of  law; \n(d)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  equal  protection  of  the  law; \n(e)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  privileges  and  immunities  of  the  law, \n(d)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  free  speech, \n(e)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  petition  the  government  for  the  redress \nof  grievances; \n(f)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  counsel  and  access  to  the  courts;  and,\n(g)  Deprived  of  their  right  to  petition  for  writ  of  habeas \ncorpus. \n103.  All  of  defendants’  aforesaid  conduct  was  also  violative  of \nplaintiffs’  and  all  class  members’  rights  under  the  First,  Fourth,  Fifth,  Sixth, \nEighth,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution,  and  violative  of  the  third  party  beneficiary  contract  rights  of \nplaintiffs  and  all  class  members,  in  that  such  conduct  constituted  deprivations \nof  substantial  life,  liberty  and  property  interests  without  due  process  of  law \nand  constituted  unreasonable  seizures  of  persons,  property  and  liberty.  This \nconduct  violated  the  rights  of  plaintiffs  and  all  other  inmates  to  due  process \n}  of  law  and  to  the  equal  protection  of  the  laws  and  the  equal  privileges  and \nimmunities  of  the  laws  as  guaranteed  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment. \n104.  Plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  were  directly  and  proximately \ndamaged  by  the  conduct,  violations,  acts  and  omissions  of  all  defendants,  as \ndescribed  above. \nJury  trial  is  hereby  demanded. \nCOUNT I \nCLAIM  FOR DECLARATORY  AND  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF \nON  BEHALF  OF  PLAINTIFFS  AND  ALL  CLASS  MEMBERS \n105.  Plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  incorporate  by  reference  as  if \nfully  set  forth  herein  the  allegations  of  paragraphs  1  through  104  above. \n106.  The  State  of  Missouri,  by  and  through  defendant  Schriro,  entered  into \ncontracts  with  defendants  Brazoria  County,  Texas,  (attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A-1)  and\nGregg  County,  Texas,  (attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A-2)  as  well  as  all  Texas  governmental \nentitles  identified  in  paragraph  17,  above. \n107.  The  contracts  were  entered  into  pursuant  to  Section  217.525  et  seq.,  RS \nMo.  (1994)  (Interstate  Corrections  Compact).  Article  III  of  the  Interstate  Corrections \nCompact  specifies  that:  “(d)  The  terms  and  provisions  of  this  compact  shall  be  a  part  of \nany  contract  entered  into  by  the  authority  of  or  pursuant  thereto  and  nothing  in  any \nsuch  contract  shall  be  inconsistent  therewith.” \n108.  Plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  are  interested  parties  in  the  contractual \nrelationships  between  the  contracting  parties  in  those  contracts,  in  that  the  contract \nand  the  Interstate  Corrections  Compact  which  is  incorporated  there,  specifies  the \nmanner  of  their  treatment,  rights  and  privileges,  and  modes  and  manners  of  redress _ \nof  grievance  of  and  for  plaintiffs’  and  class  members’  benefit. \n109.  The  Interstate  Corrections  Compact,  specifically  Article  IV,  Procedures \nand  Rights,  subparagraph  (e),  states  that: \nAll  inmates  who  may  be  confined  to  an  institution  pursuant  to  the \nprovisions  of  this  compact  shall  be  treated  in  a  reasonable  and  humane  manner \nand  shall  be  treated  equally  with  such  similar  inmates  of the  receiving state as \nmay  be  confined  in  the  same  institution.  The  fact  of  confinement  in  a  receiving \nstate  shall  not  deprive  any  inmate  so  confined  of  any  legal  rights  which  said \ninmate  would  have  had  if  confined  in  an  appropriate  institution  of  the  sending \nstate.\n110.  The  above  described  Brazoria  County  and  Gregg  County  contracts \n(Exhibits  A-1  and  A-2),  specifically  Section  III  (Contract  Administration),  at  paragraph \n3.12  (no  third  party  beneficiary  enforcement),  state  in  pertinent  part: \nIt  is  expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  enforcement  of  the  terms  and \nconditions  of  this  contract,  and  all  rights  of  action  relating  to  such  enforcement, \nshall  be  strictly  reserved  to  the  state  and  county,  and  nothing  contained  in  this \ncontract  shall  give  or  allow  any  claim  or  right  of  action  whatsoever  by  any  other \nperson  on  this  contract.  It  is  the  expressed  intention  of  the  state  and  the  county \nthat  any  entity,  other  than  the  state  or  the  county,  receiving  services  or  benefits \nunder  this  contract  shall  be  deemed  an  incidental  beneficiary  only. \nThis  contract  is  not  intended  to  create  any  rights,  liberty,  interest,  nor \nentitlements  in  favor  of  any  inmate.  The  contract  is  intended  only  to  set  forth \nthe  contractual  rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  contract  parties.  Inmates  shall \nhave  only  those  entitlements  created  by  federal  or  state  constitutions,  statutes, \nregulations,  or  case  law. \n111.  Paragraph  3.12  of  those  contracts  is  inconsistent  with  Article  III, \nParagraph  4(b)  of  the  Interstate  Corrections  Compact. \n112.  The  contracting  parties  exceeded  their  authority  to  declare  that  plaintiffs \nwere  “incidental  beneficiar(ies)  only.”  Further,  defendant  Schriro  exceeded  her \nauthority  in  contracting  with  the  said  Texas  governmental  entities,  rather  than  with \nthe  State  of  Texas.  Further,  defendant  Schriro  exceeded  her  authority  in  entering  into \na  contract  the  purpose  of  which  was  to  contract  out  the  operation  of  adult  correctional \nfacilities  to  private  prison  companies.\n113,  Defendants  cannot  legally  limit  plaintiffs’  and  all  class  members’ \nrights  to  redress  violations  of  the  said  contracts  in  that  such  violations  are \nand  were  injurious  to  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  and  caused  them \ninjuries  and  damages. \n114.  Asa  direct  and  proximate  result  of  defendants’  aforesaid  conduct \nplaintiffs  and  all  class  members  suffered  injuries  to  their  persons  including \nphysical  injury  and  severe  mental  anguish  and  mental  injury,  and  further \n~  suffered  harm  and  loss  and  deprivation  of  their  civil  rights,  constitutional \nrights  and  third  party  beneficiary  contract  rights  as  more  fully  alleged  herein. \n115.  Plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  suffered  physical  injuries  to \ntheir  persons  as  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  harms  and  loss  and \ndeprivation  of  civil  rights,  constitutional  rights  and  third  party  beneficiary \ncontract  rights  as  more  fully  alleged  herein. \n116.  Asa  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  foregoing,  plaintiffs  and \nall  class  members  live  in  fear  of  being  sent  to  these  Texas  jail  facilities  again. \nAll  plaintiffs  and  class  members  are  therefore  in  jeopardy  of  imminent  and \n_  irreparable  future  injury,  harm,  loss  and  deprivation  and  seek  declaratory  and \ninjunctive  relief  to  prevent  such  injury,  harm,  loss  and  deprivation. \n117.  All  defendants  now  threaten  that  plaintiffs  and  all  class \nmembers  are  subject  to  being  immediately  re-transferred  without  notice  to \nthe  Texas  jail  facilities  under  the  Texas  Cell  Lease  Program,  and  therefore \nplaintiffs  and  all  class  members  are  subject  to  being  again  caused  by\nC \ndefendants  to  suffer  such  future  injury,  harm,  loss  and  deprivation,  unless \nthe  equitable  relief  here  prayed  is  granted. \n118.  All  plaintiffs  and  class  members  have  no  adequate  remedy  at \nlaw. \n119.  Such  imminent  future  injury,  harm,  loss  and  deprivation  are \nlikely  to  cause  plaintiffs  and  all  class  members  serious  and  irreparable  injury \nand  harm. \n120.

Their transfer and confinement was done pursuant to a contract between the State of\nMissouri and Brazoria County whereby Brazoria County agreed to house and supervise the Missouri prisoners in\nexchange for money. The Plaintiffs allege that they are third-party beneficiaries of that contract and that Brazoria\nCounty has breached the contract. In addition, the Plaintiffs assert a § 1983 claim that they were subjected to\n\ncruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment while they were incarcerated in Brazoria\nCounty.\nOn December 17, 1998, the United States Magistrate Judge recommended Defendant Brazoria County's May 18\n962 and July 24, 1998, motions to dismiss for lack *962 of personal jurisdiction be denied. The parties were advised\nthey could file written exceptions to the recommendation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C). A de novo review\nof the record, including the exceptions filed by Brazoria County on January 15, 1999, convinces the Court that the\nrecommendation of the Magistrate Judge is correct.\nI. LONG ARM STATUTE\nIn its exceptions, Defendant Brazoria County first objects to the Magistrate's finding that the requirements of the\nMissouri long-arm statute have been satisfied. The applicable section of the Missouri long-arm statute provides\nthat a nonresident defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in Missouri \"... as to any cause of action arising\nfrom ... the making of any contract within this state.\" Mo.Rev. Stat. § 506.500. Missouri caselaw is clear that the\npurpose of the long-arm statute is \"to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of this state over nonresident\ndefendants to that extent permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nConstitution of the United States.\" State ex rel. Deere & Company v. Pinnell, 454 S.W.2d 889, 892 (Mo. banc\n1970). \"Pursuant to this objective, Missouri courts have interpreted the [long-arm statute] broadly so as not to\ndeny jurisdiction under § 506.500 in situations in which the Due Process Clause would permit the assertion of\npersonal jurisdiction.\" State ex rel. Newport v. Wiesman, 627 S.W.2d 874 (Mo. banc 1982). In Wiesman, the\nMissouri Supreme Court addressed the \"arising out of\" language in the long-arm statute. The plaintiff in that case\nwas a resident of Missouri who had been injured in a plane accident in Georgia. Claiming personal injury\ndamages, he filed suit in Missouri against Beech Aircraft Corporation, the manufacturer of the plane which\ncrashed in Georgia. Beech Aircraft's only contact with the State of Missouri was the authorization of two franchise\ndealerships which sold and serviced Beech Aircraft. None of the aircraft sold in Missouri through these franchises\nwere similar to the aircraft involved in the accident in Georgia. Nonetheless, the Missouri Supreme Court found\nthat the plaintiff's claim arose out of Beech Aircraft's contacts with Missouri, relying in part on the\ncoextensiveness of the Missouri long-arm statute and the Due Process Clause.\nIn rebuttal, Brazoria County cites the cases of Wooldridge v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 479 F.Supp. 1041\n(W.D.Mo.1979) and United Missouri Bank of Kansas City, N.A., v. Bank of N.Y., 723 F.Supp. 408, 411\n(W.D.Mo.1989) for the proposition that \"the Missouri long-arm statute is not effective to extend jurisdiction to the\nfull limits allowed under the Due Process Clause, because due process permits the assertion of general personal\njurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.\" This Court cannot concur with those decisions for two reasons. First,\nthe Missouri Supreme Court has spoken authoritatively on the issue and the Court is bound to follow Missouri law\non this issue. FED.R.CIV.P. 4(e)(1). Second, long-arm statutes are simply irrelevant to general jurisdiction. By\ndefinition, general jurisdiction only exists where a defendant's contact with the forum state is so pervasive and\ncontinuing that the defendant is effectively deemed to be a resident for purposes of personal jurisdiction. The\n[1]\nlong-arm statute, which applies to nonresident, would not be applicable in such a case.\n963 *963 To come within the language of the applicable Missouri long-arm statute, the Plaintiffs must show that\nBrazoria County entered into a contract in the State of Missouri. This is undisputed. The claims against Brazoria\nCounty, however, must also \"arise out\" of that contract. Some of Plaintiff's claims are based on the contract itself\n[2]\nand as to those claims long-arm jurisdiction is clearly established. MO.REV. STAT. 506.500.  As to the Plaintiff's\nnon-contract claims, the personal jurisdiction question requires more analysis.\nThe Missouri long-arm statute uses the term \"arises out of\" and the U.S. Supreme Court uses the phrase \"arise\nout of or relates to\" when it analyzes the Due Process Clause in the context of specific personal jurisdiction. \nHelicopteros Nacionales de Columbia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984).\nBecause the \"arising out of\" nexus is required by both the Constitution and the long-arm statute, and because the\n\"arising out of\" language in the Missouri long-arm statute must be read as broadly as the Constitution, the only\nremaining question is whether the Due Process Clause permits this suit against Brazoria County to be brought in\nMissouri.\n\nII. DUE PROCESS\n\"The constitutional touchstone of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with\ndue process remains whether the defendant purposely established minimum contacts in the forum state.\" Burger\nKing Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985). Those \"minimum contacts\nmust have a basis in `some act by which the defendant purposely avails itself of the privilege of conducting\nactivities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.'\" Asahi Metal Indus. Co.,\nLtd. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano County, 480 U.S. 102, 109, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987) (quoting \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174). \"When a corporation purposely avails itself of the privilege of\nconducting activities within the forum state, it has a clear notice that it is subject to suit there and can act to\nalleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or,\nif the risks are too great, severing its connection with the state.\" World-Wide Volkswagon Corporation v.\nWoodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980) (quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235,\n78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)). The exercise of jurisdiction must also be reasonable, taking into account\nsuch factors as (a) the burden on the defendant; (b) the interest of the forum state, (c) the plaintiff's interest in\nobtaining relief, (d) the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of\ncontroversies, (e) the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies. \nAsahi Metal, 480 U.S. at 113-14, 107 S.Ct. 1026.\nThe seminal test for determining personal jurisdiction in a contracts case is found in Burger King, 471 U.S. at\n479, 105 S.Ct. 2174. The court must take into account prior negotiations, contemplated future consequences, the\nterms of the contract and the parties actual course of dealing. The contract in this case contemplated an ongoing\n964 relationship between the State of Missouri and Brazoria County. The contract was for a one year period, *964\nwith a provision for three annual renewals. There were a substantial number of Missouri prisoners housed in\nBrazoria County and the contract required the county to notify Missouri, in writing, and to obtain advance\nauthorization for non-emergency medical, dental or psychiatric care not covered under enumerated routine\nservices. Prisoner deaths or escapes were to be reported to the State of Missouri immediately. Brazoria County\nreceived continuing payments from Missouri for the housing and supervision of Missouri prisoners. Brazoria\nCounty knew that when the contract was terminated, the prisoners would be returned to Missouri. These are not\nrandom fortuitous or attenuated connections with Missouri. Furthermore, the foreseeable consequences of the\ncontract have had a substantial impact on Missouri, including adverse publicity and Plaintiffs' claims in this case\nagainst Missouri state employees.\nThe contract also states that it is to be \"governed in all respects by the laws of the state (Missouri) and any\nlitigation with respect thereto shall be brought in the courts of the state.\" (Doc. # 26, Ex. A at 8.) Brazoria County\ncontends that the Magistrate Judge erred by interpreting the choice of law and forum selection language in the\ncontract to be its consent to suit in Missouri for noncontractual claims by the Plaintiffs. Even if the Court were to\ndisagree with the Magistrate Judge's conclusion on this issue, the choice of law and forum selection clauses are\nevidence that Brazoria County availed itself of the privileges of conducting activities within the forum state, thus\ninvoking the benefits and protection of its laws. The purpose of personal jurisdiction rules is to permit a party not\nto affiliate with a foreign state. If a party wants the benefits of such an affiliation, however, the party also carries\nthe burdens. If Brazoria County needed to enforce its contract, it would do so in Missouri courts. Brazoria County\nclearly availed itself of the benefits of the forum state, even if the forum selection clause is not a specific consent\nto jurisdiction.\nThe next question is whether the Plaintiffs' claims \"arise out of or relate to\" the contract that Brazoria County has\nwith the State of Missouri. It is important to note that the standard is in the disjunctive. The claim must arise out of\nor relate to the contacts that a defendant has with the forum state. The purpose of the contract between Brazoria\nCounty and Missouri was to provide housing and supervision for Missouri prisoners. Brazoria County's forum\nactivities were directed at these Missouri prisoners who were Missouri residents. See Keeton v. Hustler\nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (1984). The only reason the Plaintiffs were in\nBrazoria County is because of the contract with Missouri. The nexus between the prisoners and Brazoria County,\ntherefore, was proximately caused by the contract.\n\nBrazoria County objects to the \"but for\" finding by the Magistrate Judge arguing that the \"but for the existence of\nthe contract\" analysis has no support in caselaw. Yet, in Burger King, itself, the United States Supreme Court\nrefers to proximate cause as the measure of whether something arises out of a defendant's forum activities. \"...\n[W]here individuals `purposefully derive benefit' from their interstate activities, ... it may well be unfair to allow\nthem to escape having to account in other states for consequences that arise proximately from such activities.\" \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 473-74, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (emphasis added). In the lower courts, there is also strong\nevidence that a \"but for\" analysis is being used. Creech v. Roberts, 908 F.2d 75, 80 (6th Cir.1990),cert. denied,\n499 U.S. 975, 111 S.Ct. 1619, 113 L.Ed.2d 717 (1991); Lanier v. American Bd. of Endodontics, 843 F.2d 901,\n909, (6th Cir.),cert. denied,488 U.S. 926, 109 S.Ct. 310, 102 L.Ed.2d 329 (1988); Deluxe Ice Cream Co. v.\nR.C.H. Tool Corp., 726 F.2d 1209 (7th Cir.1984); Prejean v. Sonatrach, Inc., 652 F.2d 1260 (5th Cir.1981).\n965 *965 In Terra International, Inc. v. Mississippi Chem. Corp., 119 F.3d 688, 694 (8th Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S.\n___, 118 S.Ct. 629, 139 L.Ed.2d 609 (1997), the court noted that \"while these tort claims do not center around a\ndisagreement over the specific terms of the license agreement, one could argue that they relate to the\nagreement's interpretation because the tort claims directly involve the entire subject matter of the license\nagreement.\" Similarly, the prisoner's claims relate to the subject matter of the contract. Indeed, the Plaintiffs'\nclaims are more clearly related to the Missouri/Brazoria County contract than the tort claim was to the contract in \nTerra Int'l. Brazoria County seeks to distinguish Terra Int'l because the tort claim in that case was being asserted\nby a party to the contract and, in contrast, the Plaintiffs are not parties to the Missouri/Brazoria County contract.\nThis factual distinction, however, does not alter the Terra Int'l court's reasoning that the required nexus was met\nbecause the tort claim was related to the subject matter of the agreement. Nor does it make a difference in this\ncase where the Plaintiffs' claims are so foreseeable and closely related to the contract.\nBrazoria County also objects to personal jurisdiction in Missouri because the contract provides that it does not\ncreate a right of action under the contract for any-one other than the parties. Brazoria County seems to suggest\nthat this language could somehow curtail the territorial jurisdiction of the State of Missouri. While the courts have\nheld that consent to jurisdiction is permissible, and waiver of jurisdiction by failing to raise it will subject a party to\npersonal jurisdiction in the forum state, the Court is unaware of any case which says that the parties, by contract,\nmay limit the territorial power of a state court.\nFinally, it is reasonable to subject Brazoria County to the personal jurisdiction of Missouri courts. The burden on\nBrazoria County is minimal, particularly given that it expected to sue and be sued in Missouri for any direct\ncontract claim. The forum has a strong interest in pursuing the suit here because the Plaintiffs are here and it\nwould be burdensome and a potential security risk to transport the Plaintiffs to Texas. State employees are\ncodefendants in this matter and the State has a direct interest in a proper allocation of fault in a single forum. In\nterms of interstate administration of justice, it makes no sense to have the case against some Defendants in\nMissouri and some Defendants in Texas when the factual issues are interwoven.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the court adopts the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge that defendant Brazoria County's\nmotion of May 18 and July 24, 1998, to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction be denied.\n[1] Some of the confusion on this matter may be attributable to those cases which suggest that there is no need\nto address the Missouri long-arm statute at all because the only issue is whether the due process standard has\nbeen satisfied. This suggestion is incorrect. Weisman and its progeny stand for the proposition that the language\nof the long-arm statute should be interpreted to reach as far as the Due Process Clause will permit, but in all\ncases involving specific jurisdiction, a court must first determine whether the long-arm statute applies. When\nmaking that determination, however, a court must give the broadest interpretation to the language of the long-arm\nstatute that is consistent with the Constitution.\n[2] Brazoria County seems to believe that as to the Plaintiff's contract claims, the Court must first decide the third-\nparty beneficiary issue before addressing personal jurisdiction. If the merits of a claim had to be addressed\n\nbefore jurisdiction could be resolved, many of the benefits of personal jurisdiction limitations would be lost. Also,\nbecause the Court finds that there is personal jurisdiction on the Plaintiffs' federal claims, it would be especially\ninefficient to resolve the merits of the contract claims at this stage.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The sum of\n$100,000.00  will  be  initially  allocated  to  group  B.  Additional  sums  may  be\nallocated to group B as set forth below after all payments have been made to the\ngroup C claimants and the litigation and class administration expenses incurred by\nClass Counsel have been paid.  The total funding of group B will be distributed to\nthe group B claimants on a pro rata basis.  Pro rata basis shall be determined by\ndividing the total funding by the total number of group B claimants.  In the event\na group B claimant was in both institutions as referred to above, he shall receive\ntwo pro rata shares. By way of example, if the total funding equals $250,000.00\nand the total number of group B claimants equals  100, the pro rata share would be\n$2,500 per inmate.\n7.  Group C consists of all inmates who submit a claim for monetary compensation  for\nsignificant physical injuries. The sum of $820,000.00 will be allocated to group C.\nThe value of each group C claim shall be determined by United States Magistrate\nJudge William Knox of the United States District Court for the Western District\nof Missouri, Central Division, or, for named plaintiffs  in Kesler, et al. v. King, et\nal,  G-96-CV-703, filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of\nTexas,  Galveston  Division,  at the  election  of  such plaintiffs,  by  United  States\nMagistrate  Judge  John  Froeschner  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the\nSouthern District of Texas, Galveston Division.  The Court shall enter an order\nestablishing the procedure for the valuation of the group C claims.  In the event the\ntotal  value  of all group C claims is less than  $820,000.00, then the  remaining\n\nbalance shall be allocated equally to group A and group B. By way of example, if\nthe total value of all group C claims is $520,000.00, then an additional  $150,000.00\nshall be allocated to group A and an additional $150,000.00 shall be allocated to\ngroup B.\n8.  A class member  may submit a claim under group A and/or  group B.  A class\nmember  may not submit a claim under group A and/or group B if he submits a\nclaim under group C.\n9.

The settlement is the product of extensive negotiation conducted over a period of\nseveral months and requiring the services of a mediator experienced in this sort of\nlitigation  both  from  his  private  practice and  from  his time as a  United  States\nMagistrate in this Court.\n12.  The settlement, in all respects, is fair to all parties represented or not, participating\nor not.\n13.  Court approval of the settlement, mandatory under Rule 23(e) in any event, is a\nnecessary  and  inherent  part  of  the  settlement  as  well  as  the  class  action\ncertification.  If this Court or any appellate court disapproves the settlement, then\nthe entire settlement and certification  are, by agreement of all parties, void.\n14.  In further  support of this motion, various parties have contemporaneously  filed\nsuggestions.\n\nWHEREFORE, the parties jointly move this Court for approval of the class settlement\nunder Rule 23(e) upon the terms set out in the settlement agreement.\nRespectfully  submitted,\nJohn P.

Some of these counties in turn contracted with  .\nprivate jail companies to operate the facilities where the Missouri prisoners were\nhoused.  Under the Texas Cell Lease Program, more than 2100 Missouri prisoners\nwere transferred to Texas and several have claimed that their civil rights were violated\nwhile they were in Texas facilities and during their transportation to Texas.  More than\n700 of these prisoners are plaintiffs in pending lawsuits in state and federal court.\nAfter protracted litigation, the Court conditionally certified a class action to address all\nclaims arising out of the Texas Cell Lease Program.

The Mistreatment of Missouri Prisoners Sent to Texas\nThis litigation was catalyzed by a videotape of an incident which occurred on\nSeptember 18, 1996, at the Brazoria County, Texas, jail.  The videotape shows a large\ngroup of officers dressed in riot gear entering a pod full of prisoners and ordering them\nto lie on the floor.  The officers are armed with stun guns and at least one German\nShepherd dog.  Some of the officers worked for Capitol Corrections Resources, Inc.\n(\"CCRI\"). a private jail company, and some for the Brazoria County sheriff, E.J. \"Joe\"\nKing.  At no time do the prisoners offer any resistance.1  They are forced by the\nofficers  to leave their pod by crawling on their stomachs, single file, in front of the  -· -  -\nbarking dog.  In the hallway, they are forced to lie down in rows on their stomachs.\nPrisoners who move too slowly are kicked in the side or between their legs by  officers\nshouting obscenities.  Without provocation, one officer  steps on a prisoner's back to\nforce him closer to the ground.  After a period of time, the prisoners are stripped and\nsubjected to body and cavity searches.  These graphic searches are conducted in full\n'It is unclear why the pods were being searched.  One Texas official said that the smell\nof marijuana was detected coming from a specific pod.  Chief Deputy Wagner of the Brazoria\nCounty Sheriffs Department stated that the butt of a marijuana cigarette was discovered during\nthe search of that pod.  The shakedown, however, also involved pods other than the one where\nthe smell of marijuana originated.  There is no evidence to explain why the additional pods\nwere searched.  The videotape documents that no prisoner was disruptive when the guards\nentered these additional pods.  No action was ever taken concerning the marijuana butt and it\nwas not preserved as evidence.\nZ\n\n816-931-1484(|jENNER  & JftMES P. C.  O  521 P04\n  .\nlg 00\nview of several officers and other prisoners and recorded on camera.2  After the\nsearches, the nude inmates are ordered to crawl back to their bunks where they are\nrequired to lay nude for two more hours on steel bunks that have been stripped of\nmattresses and bedding.  This process is then repeated in the next pod.  Although the\ninmates are behaving peacefully,  some playing a game of cards, the guards use tear gas\nagainst them.  The inmates, obviously experiencing pain from the gas, are then\nsubjected to the same process of crawling into the hall and then back to their pod to be\nstrip searched.  During one of these searches, a prisoner with a broken ankle is dragged\nout of a room by his arm.  The video camera shows the German Shepherd biting\nprisoners and captures the sound of stun guns being used.  See also, Kesler v. King, 29\nF.Supp.2d  356 (S.D. Tex. 1998) (describing the occurrence in the Brazoria County\nfacility).\nThere is a videotape of a similar incident in Gregg County, Texas, which\noccurred on March 2, 1997.  This video shows similar mistreatment of prisoners.\nSome prisoners are gassed as an apparent disciplinary measure.  One tape shows a\nprisoner wailing in pain after this treatment for a lengthy period of time.  Another\nshows guards hitting inmates with streams of water from fire hoses.  The Gregg\n2 Officials first described the videotape which recorded these events as a training video,\neven though it has since been demonstrated that the tape was not done for training purposes.\nThis admitted mischaracterization was suggested by Sheriff King in an effort to \"explain away\nthe \"bad scene\" created by the existence of the videotape.\"  Kesler,  29 F.

(  ì  521  P05\n  -\n19 00\nvideotapes also show prisoners being subjected to strip searches and some are beaten\nand kicked.\nAt the class action fairness hearing, several Missouri prisoners testified about\ntheir experiences in Texas under the Cell Lease Program.  These prisoners described\nbeing taken from their cells in Missouri and subjected to an eighteen hour bus ride to\nTexas.  During the trip, they were not allowed to use toilets, but instead had to relieve\nthemselves in a large bucket or can.  Those who were sent to the Brazoria  facility\ncomplained of being abused by a Lieutenant Wallace, who was infamous for kicking\nprisoners with his steel-toed boots.  For example, Daniel Owsley testified  that Wallace\ncalled him a nigger, sprayed him with mace, and kicked him in the head in response to  -\nhis request to attend his grandfather's  funeral.  Owsley testified that this abuse causes\nhim to suffer  from recurring grand mal seizures.  Lieutenant Wallace had previously\nbeen convicted and imprisoned for using excessive force against inmates, yet he was\ngiven a position of authority at the Brazoria facility, even though the warden at the\nBrazoria County facility was aware of Wallace's background.\nMany prisoners complained of being subjected to electrical shocks during\nsearches, and sprayed with mace and fire hoses for minor infractions.  Dwight E. Cofer\ntestified that, because one prisoner in a pod refused a tray of food, guards sprayed the\nentire group with mace.  John Reed testified that he was slammed against a wall, told\nthat he would learn to love Texas, and threatened that he would become a missing\n4\n\nei6-931-1484  KENNER & JfiMES P.

Ronald Hellm and Michael\nDaugherty testified that German Shepherds were sent into pods unrestrained, and\nencouraged to bite and intimidate prisoners.  Darrin Michael Sutton claimed that he was\nhog-tied for 17 hours for refusing to sign a conduct violation.\nThere were also complaints about prison conditions and inadequate medical care.\nSeveral prisoners explained that in Texas, unlike Missouri, there was no segregation of\nprisoners by levels which meant that non-violent criminals with short sentences were\nhoused with violent inmates with multiple life sentences.  Charles W. Shaw, Jr., was\ntransferred  to Texas despite a serious medical problem and was denied medical ~\ntreatment there.  He stated that he contracted pneumonia in Texas and almost died from\nthe infection because he was left without care or adequate blankets for almost a week.\nSeveral prisoners described their arrival at the Brazoria County jail where they were\nforced to kneel outside for hours with temperatures in the thirties and then forced to say\nthat they loved Texas.  Those that did not were hit by their guards.\nSeveral of these inmates testified that they complained to Missouri officials,\neither directly or through their families, but no one would believe them.  There was\nevidence that grievances were not seriously addressed and some grievances were stolen\nfrom the locked grievance box that were only accessible to Texas prison officials.\n5\n\nr  C.\n816-931-141  KENNER& JfìMESP.C.  521  P07  JPN  19\nMissouri inmates were told that if they kept complaining to their families, they would\nlose phone privileges.\nThe Court has also reviewed the documents compiled during the State of\nMissouri's investigation of the incidents at the Brazoria and Gregg County facilities.\nThese documents further substantiate the inmates' allegations of abuse and mistreatment\nin Texas.  The investigation also demonstrated a gross lack of oversight by Missouri\nDOC qfficials.  Even though the DOC had been repeatedly contacted by Missouri\nprisoners, their families and religious leaders, about the conditions in the Texas jails,\nthe DOC failed to conduct a serious investigation.  For example, one Missouri  official\nwas aware that there was a videotape of the Brazoria County incident, but did not\nfollow up when Sheriff King failed to produce the videotape when requested to do so.\nIt was not until the videotapes were released to the media that the State of Missouri\nterminated the Cell Lease Program and returned its prisoners to Missouri.\nB.  The Resulting Litigation\nHundreds of prisoners filed suits complaining about their treatment in Texas.\nSome were filed in the Southern District of Texas, some in the Eastern District of\nMissouri and some in the Western District of Missouri.  Some were also filed in state\ncourts.  Several of these suits were consolidated for pretrial procedures before this\nCourt, and discovery has proven to be ponderous, time-consuming and expensive.  For\nexample, the State of Missouri took the position that it was going to depose every\nß\n\nr  n\n816-931-1484  KENNER  8. JfiMES  P.

At one point, counsel anticipated spending virtually all of their\nwaking hours attending these depositions for weeks on end.  There were also\nvoluminous documents relevant to the dispute.  During this difficult  litigation, the law\nfirm of Shook Hardy & Bacon admirably agreed to serve as a depository for thousands\nof these documents, greatly facilitating the progress of the litigation.  The Court thanks\nShook,for its generous dedication of resources to these cases.\nFaced with daunting litigation costs, the parties in the consolidated cases sought\na more effective tool to resolve their dispute.  The chosen vehicle was a settlement\nclass action.  On July 20, 1999, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in one of the\nconsolidated cases and subsequently filed a joint motion for conditional certification of\na setdement class and a joint motion for approval of the settlement.\nThe class consists of all Missouri inmates sent to Texas between January 1,\n1995, and December 31, 1997, including both inmates who have filed individual suits\nand those that have not.  The named Defendants are certain Missouri officials,  the\nprivate prison companies that housed Missouri inmates in Texas, certain Texas counties\nwith which the State of Missouri contracted, and a private company that transported\nMissouri inmates to Texas.  The Class Complaint asserts that the civil rights of the\nclass members were violated by their conditions of confinement and treatment during\ntheir transportation to Texas and in the Texas prison facilities.  It also alleges that the\n\nn\nai6-931-1484  KENNER & JPMES P. C.  521 P09  JRN 19 · .\n00  n 23\nclass members are third-party beneficiaries of some of the contracts between the State\nof Missouri and the Texas entities, and alleges the Defendants breached these contracts.\nThe Class Complaint seeks both equitable and legal relief.  The class also seeks\nactual, compensatory, and punitive damages, as well as reasonable attorney fees and\ncosts.  On July 29, 1999, the Court granted the Joint Motion for Conditional\nCertification,  and provisionally certified the following mandatory plaintiff class under\nFederal Rule of Civü Procedure 23(b)(2):\nA  class  of  individuals  comprised  of  every  Missouri  Department  of\nCorrections inmate who was ever transferred, housed, assigned, or relocated\n(or who has or ever will claim to have been transferred, housed, assigned,\nor  relocated)  to any correctional  facility  anywhere  in the State of Texas\nbetween January  1, 1995 and December 31, 1997 for any length of time\nwhatsoever, whether or not any particular member of that class is still in the\ncustody of the Department.\n[Doc. 107].  The parties agree that final approval of the settlement of this class action\nwill bar any pending or future litigation regarding any of the incidents involving\nMissouri prisoners housed in Texas or transported to Texas under the Cell Lease\nProgram.\nC.  Settlement\nUnder the proposed settlement, the Defendants agree to refrain from taking\ncertain actions in the future.  The State of Missouri agrees not to contract to house class\nmembers in Texas, other than on an individual basis pursuant to the Interstate\nCorrections Compact (\"ICC\").  The moratorium on sending prisoners to Texas will last\n8\n\n816-931-1484  ,£NNER   JRfiES  P. C.  >\n &   521P10  J ñ N l g > 00\nfive years, ending on June 15, 2004.  During that five-year period, Missouri prisoners\nwill only be transported to other states under the ICC if it is necessary to transfer them\noutside of the State of Missouri for their protection or to answer charges in another\nstate.  Similarly, Brazoria County and Gregg County, Texas, as well as Dove\nDevelopment Corporation (\"Dove\") and CCRI (collectively known as the \"Texas\nDefendants\")  agreed not to accept Missouri inmates other than those sent to Texas\nunder ,the ICC.  With respect to any class members sent to Texas under the ICC, the\nState of Missouri and the Texas Defendants agree to take all reasonable steps to ensure\nthat the facility housing a class member does not employ anyone convicted of a crime\ninvolving abuse, neglect, or assault upon an inmate.  The State of Missouri also agrees\nto set up a process to review claims by inmates about conduct violations that may have\nbeen unfairly issued while they were confined  in Texas.  Finally, Missouri and the\nTexas Defendants agree not to pursue any claim for reimbursement of a class member's\ncosts of incarceration from the funds awarded pursuant to the settlement.\nIn response to an inquiry from the Court, the Defendants have agreed that these\nequitable agreements are enforceable as contracts despite the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct (\"PLRA\").  Defendant Dora Schriro acknowledged that the Settlement Agreement\nwas a \"private settlement agreement\" rather than a \"consent decree\" under PLRA, and\nthat it could therefore be enforced in state court.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(6); [Doc.\n111].  The Settlement Agreement itself states that \"[a]ny action for breach of this\n\nr  r\n816-931-1434  KENNER 8. JAMES P. C.  521  Pll  jp^   ,\n  lg  00\nagreement may only be filed in the Circuit Court for Cole County, Missouri.\" [Doc.\n96, Ex. A at 12].  Class counsel concurred that the Settlement Agreement was a private\nsettlement agreement enforceable in state court. [Doc. 113].\nThe Settlement Agreement also includes $2,220,000 to be paid into a Texas\nInmate Litigation Settlement Fund.  The Agreement proposes that $900,000 be\nallocated to attorney fees for class counsel, $300,000 be available for class\nadministration expenses, and the remaining $1,020,000 be divided among the class\nmembers.  These funds would be divided among three groups of class members: (A) all\ninmates confined in the State of Texas who submit a claim for monetary compensation;\n(B) all inmates who submit a claim for monetary compensation and who were confined\nin any of the cell blocks that were searched by law enforcement personnel at the\nBrazoria County Correctional Center on September  18, l99ó, and/or the Gregg County\nCorrectional Center on March 2, 1997; (C) all inmates who incurred  significant\nphysical injuries and who submit a claim form for damages.  Groups A and B would\ninitially be provided $100,000 each to be divided among all claimants.  Group A would\nbe compensated on B,per diem basis, while Group B would be compensated on a. pro\nmta basis.  Group C would be provided $820,000 to be allocated to Group members by\nmagistrate judges.  In the event that the money provided to Group C exceeded the value\nof the Group's claims, that amount would then be divided between Groups A and B.\n10\n10\n\nr  r·\n816-931-1484  KENNER 8. JfiMES P.C.  521  Pip ^\n  T\nClass members who submit claims in Group C could not submit claims under Groups A\nor B.  The other class members could submit claims under Groups A, B, or both.\nD.  Notice and Opportunity to be Heard for Class Members\nOn August 26, 1999, the Court approved a Notice to the class members\nregarding the proposed settlement. [Doc. 118].  In addition to describing the settlement,\nthe Notice explained that class members could obtain more information at the Office of\nthe Cle,rk for the Western District of Missouri or at their prison law libraries.3  An\nobjection form was attached to the Notice, and objectors were notified that any\nobjections must be filed with the Court by October 25, 1999.  On September 8, 1999,\nthis Notice was sent to the Division of Family Services Office in each county of the  ¯ ¯¯\nState of Missouri for posting. [See Doc. 120].  The next day, the Notice was mailed to\nindividual class members living in the custody of the Missouri Department of\nCorrections.  [See Docs. 127 and 142].  If a class member was no longer in the custody\nof the DOC, the Notice was mailed to their last known address.  The Notice was\nsubsequently published in The Kansas City Siar, The Call, The St. Louis American,  and\nthe St. Louis  Post-Dispatch.\nBy October 25, 1999, the Court had received approximately 170 objection forms\nfrom the 2100 class members, meaning that about 8 per cent of the class objected to the\n3  With the consent of class counsel and cooperation of defense counsel, the\nCourt sent notebooks containing all of the documents relevant to the class action and\nthe settlement to each prison library in the State of Missouri in September 1999.\n11  11\n\nr  O\n816-931-1484  KENNER 8. JAMES P. C.  521 P13  JfiN 19 •øø\n  11:25\nsettlement.  Many objectors complained that the amount of money allocated to the class\nwas insufficient to compensate for their injuries in Texas.  A related and also common\nobjection was that too much of the settlement fund had been allocated to attorney fees\nand costs.  A few of these objectors noted that class counsel would receive more under\nthe settlement than had been contemplated in their fee agreements with their own\nattorneys.  A large group of the objectors simply described their treatment in Texas,\nrecounting incidents of physical and verbal abuse by guards and other inmates, denial\nof medical care and access to courts, and separation from their families in Missouri.\nSome objection forms stated no specific objection, or merely requested additional\ninformation about the settlement.  A significant group of objectors were offended  that\nthe State of Missouri had not admitted liability or contributed funds to the settlement.\nSome class members objected that class counsel were not adequately representing then-\ninterests.  On November 10, 1999, in responses to this concern, the Court appointed\nattorney John W. Kurtz to represent the objectors at the fairness hearing.\nA fairness hearing was held on December 3, 1999.  Class counsel, defense\ncounsel, and the attorney for the objectors were allowed to present argument and\nevidence to the court.  Class counsel first presented testimony from Richard H.\nRalston, an experienced and highly regarded mediator who helped to negotiate the class\nsettlement.  Ralston testified that, in his former occupation as a federal magistrate\njudge, he had handled the prisoner docket in Jefferson  City, Missouri, the venue where\n12\n1\n\no\n521  P14  JPIN 19  '00  11:25\n816-931-1484  KENNER & JPMES P. C.\nthe consolidated cases would have been tried.  Ralston testified that, in his experience,\njurors in this venue awarded damages to prisoners only in serious cases involving\ndocumented beatings or the deliberate denial of medical care.  Ralston recalled one\nparticular case, involving a prisoner named Ronald Panon, in which the jury awarded\n$80,000 in damages.  The Parton case involved very serious injuries, an articulate,\nattractive plaintiff and clear evidence of abuse.  Ralston testified  that, in general,\nprisoner cases resulted in defense verdicts or small verdicts of less than $15,000.  He\nexplained that jurors in this venue view prison cases with a \"jaundiced eye.\"  Ralston\nserved as a magistrate judge in the late 1970s and early 1980s, before the enactment of\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act.  •-\nRalston testified that he began mediating the Texas prisoner cases approximately\none and one half years ago.  During the mediation, the State of Missouri adamantly\nrefused  to contribute any money to the settlement, and so the mediation focused on\nequitable relief that the State could provide.  Missouri refused  to permanently forego its\nright to send inmates to Texas again, but was amenable to providing other kinds of\nnonmonetary relief.\nAccording to Ralston, there was also a serious question about the ability of\nTexas counties to pay any money toward the settlement.  Settlement funds were\navailable, however, from the private prison corporations in the suit.  These\ncorporations agreed to contribute $2.2 million, which was the limit of their primary\n13  13\n\nr  n\n„oi  ycmcp  ç.

The\ntransportation company defendant took the position that it had done nothing wrong, but\nthat it would contribute a small amount of money to avoid the nuisance of trying the\ncases.\nClass counsel next presented testimony from Lisa Dahl, a jury consultant4 who\nconducted a focus group to determine the likely attitudes of jurors in this venue to the\nprisoners' cases.  The focus group included seven individuals representing a cross-\nsection of the likely ages and genders that would be found on a venire. [Pi. 's Ex. 4].\nOn October 14, 1998, this group was shown a videotape of how class members had\nbeen treated in Texas.  The focus group clearly viewed the prisoners' claims with a\njaundiced eye.  Most believed that prison ordinarily included such treatment, and a\nmajority thought the prisoners should receive little, if any, compensation.  The focus\ngroup did not seem to be bothered by what they saw on the videotapes.  Dahl  testified\nthat, in her professional opinion, if even a few people with such attitudes were on a\njury, they would either hold out for a defense verdict or insist on a compromise verdict\nwith lower damages for the Plaintiff.  Although Dahl's research was not designed to be\na predictive test, it underscores Ralston's view mat mid-Missouri juries rarely award\nany damages to prisoners.\n*Dahl holds a bachelor's degree in political science and a masters' degree in litigation\nscience.  She has been employed as a jury consultant since 1991, and is well known in the\nKansas City area.\n14  14\n\n816-931-1484(  KENNER & JPfES  P. C.  521  P16  JfìN  19  ¯ 00  11 = 26\nFour attorneys who had participated in the negotiation of the settlement made\npresentations to the Court.  John Mollenkamp, representing the State of Missouri,\nexplained that the State would never pay any money to settle the prisoners' cases.  He\nstated that the State has a policy of refusing to offer money to settle any prison claims\neven if they are meritorious and recounted an incident in which the State insisted on\ntrying a case that the plaintiff had been willing to settle for $27.  According to\nMollenkamp, this policy has reduced the number of prison suits that are filed.\nSylvester James, who represented hundreds of Plaintiffs in the consolidated cases,\ntestified that settlement negotiations were hard fought.  He recounted that Missouri\nlaughed when class counsel requested that sentences be shortened as part of the  •-\nsettlement, and that Missouri was steadfast in its refusal  to permanently give up its right\nto send prisoners to Texas, despite being asked to do so dozens of times.  James\nexplained to the Court that the attorneys spent days on end together, arguing heatedly\nover the settlement.  Finally, Craig Heidemann explained to the Court that class\ncounsel had expended an enormous amount of time litigating their clients' cases.\nHeidemann presented an exhibit summarizing the number of hours worked by class\ncounsel, which showed that if the Court awarded the requested $900,000 in attorney\nfees, each class counsel would lose approximately $97,000 worth of services because of\ntheir participation in this litigation.  Finally, Frank Carlson submitted evidence about\nthe number of class members who received serious physical injuries in Texas.\n15\n\nf _  _   p  r  521  P17  JfiN  19  '00  1\n-14a4   .ÆNNrER &  TJÛfiMMCErçS  P.C.\n_g31-14a4  .ÆNNER & JfiMES  P.C.\ngi6\nPlaintiffs'  Exhibit 7 summarized the injuries of the 59 inmates believed to constitute\nmost of Group C.  Several of the injuries were caused by stun guns, dog bites, tear gas,\nmace, or blows by guards.  Most of these occurrences resulted in pain and soft tissue\ninjuries causing symptoms such as back pain.  Carlson admitted, however, that he was\nunaware of how many members of the class would actually qualify for membership in\nClass C.\nJohn Kurtz presented the objectors' case at the hearing.  His presentation was\nexhaustive and his advocacy eloquent.  The Court thanks Mr. Kurtz for his willingness\nto represent the objectors at the hearing.  The following objectors were allowed to\naddress the Court via closed circuit television:  Dan¯in Michael Sutton; Michael  -\nDaugherry; Louis Thomas; Dwight E. Cofer; Ray Tilley; Richard Porter; Charles W.\nShaw, Jr.; Courtland Harral; Jay C. Wheeler; Roland Davis; Rodney W. Marlett; John\nReed; Danial Owsley; Ronald Hellm; and Kevin Kisling.  Kenneth Thompson, a class\nmember who has been released from prison, addressed the Court in person.  Overall,\nthe objectors' testimony about their treatment in Texas was starkly similar and\ncompelling.  The objectors' most important complaint was that the State of Missouri\ndid not contribute any money to the settlement and refused to accept any responsibility\nfor its lax oversight.  The objectors were also dissatisfied with the amount of money\nallocated to the settlement fund because their injuries were so severe that there would\nnot be enough money in the fund to adequately compensate them.  Most preferred to\n\n816-931-1484 ONNER  & JONES P. C.  O  521 P18  JfìN  19  ¯00  11:27\nhave their cases tried rather than be settled.  Many were frustrated that they could not\nopt out of the class.  Some expressed concern about the amount of money being paid\nout of the settlement to class counsel as fees and costs.  They believed that class\ncounsel had earned their fee but there was not enough money in the fund  to cover the\nprisoners' damages and the attorney fees and expenses.  Some stated that they wanted\nto take their cases to trial because they believed that they, as well as their attorneys,\nwould get more money if the cases were tried rather than settled.\nII.  Legal Standard\nBecause this class action may not be settled without the Court's approval, it is\nthe Court's obligation to determine whether the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable,'\nand adequate.  Grunin v. International House of Pancakes, 513 F.2d 114, 123 (8*\nCir.), cert, denied, 423 U.S. 864 (1975); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) (1999) (\"[a] class\naction shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court.\").\nUnder Rule 23(e), \"the district court acts as a fiduciary which must serve as a guardian\nof the rights of absent class members.\"  Grunin, 513 F.2d at 123.  To determine\nwhether to approve the Settlement Agreement, the Court must consider the following\nfactors: \"the merits of the plaintiffs  case, weighed against the terms of the settlement;\nthe defendant's financial condition; the complexity and expense of further  litigation;\nand the amount of opposition to the settlement.\"  Van Horn v. Trìckey, 840 F.2d 604,\n606 (8th Cir. 1988) {citing Grunin, 513 F.2d at 124).

L.\nS16\nfactor that should be considered in evaluating a class action settlement.  Angela R. by\nHesselbein  v. Clinton, 999 F.2d 320, 324 (8th Cir. 1993).\nHI.  Discussion\nApplying the Grunìn factors to the Settlement Agreement demonstrates that it is\nfair, reasonable and adequate.  The Court is convinced that the class members will\nreceive more compensation through settlement than trial.  Further litigation would also\nbe highly complicated and expensive for both the parties and the public.  Finally, only a\nsmall percentage of the class members have objected to the settlement.\nA.  The Merits of the Plaintiffs'  Cases\nBalancing the merits of the plaintiffs  case against the terms of the settlement is¯ ¯¯\n\"the single most important factor in determining whether a settlement is fair,\nreasonable, and adequate.\"  Van Horn,  840 F.2d at 607.  Because the purpose of\nsettlement is to avoid the delay and expense of a trial, however, the Court \"need not\nresolve all of the underlying disputes, . ..  and the value of the settlement need not be\ndetermined with absolute precision.\"  DeBoer v. Mellon Mortgage  Co., 64 F.3d 1171,\n1178 (8th Cir. 1995), cert, denied, 517 U.S. 1156 (1996) (citing Grunin, 513 F.2d at\n123-24).\nThe greatest strength of the Plaintiffs' claims are the videotapes.  These\nvideotapes document behavior which the United States Constitution forbids.  On the\nother hand, only a small minority of the class members were shown on the tapes.\n18\n\nr  °\n816-931-1484  KENNER & JRMES P. C.  521  P20\nSome class members were not even housed in the Brazoria and Gregg County facilities\nbut were sent to other counties in Texas.  In the absence of concrete documentation,\nallegations of abuse are difficult to establish.  This is not to say that undocumented\nabuse does not occur, only that it is more difficult to ascertain the truth and that works\nto the disadvantage of the class members who would carry the burden of proof at trial.\nThese proof problems must also be evaluated in the context of mid-Missouri, the\nplace where most of these lawsuits would be tried.  Both Lisa Dahl and Rich Ralston\ndemonstrated that it is difficult to convince a mid-Missouri jury that a prisoner's\nConstitutional rights have been violated.  For example, members of the jury focus\ngroup were neither shocked nor dismayed when they saw the videotape.  More than one\ncommented that a prisoner's life should be punitive.  While the focus group was not\nscientifically selected, and a real jury would have been drawn from a broader\ngeographic area, the attitude expressed by the focus group is consistent with the\nexperiences of this Court and Rich Ralston, who handled the mid-Missouri prisoner\ndocket for many years.\nEven the federal government had difficulty convicting the guards who were\nshown abusing prisoners on the Brazoria County tape.  The criminal trial against\nLieutenant Wallace resulted in a misdemeanor conviction for a civil rights violation, the\nleast serious charge filed by the government.  The government dismissed criminal\ncharges against the handler of the German Shepherd who is shown on the videotape\n19\n\n816-S31-14a/  .ÆNNER & JAMES P. C.  '  521  P21  ^  19  •00\nbiting one of the Missouri inmates during 1996 incident at the Brazoria County Jail.\nThe dismissal followed a hung jury which voted 10-2 in favor of acquitting the dog\nhandler.  The Brazoría County guard, who indiscriminately used the stun gun on\nprisoners, pled guilty to a misdemeanor conviction.  While the burden of proof in a\ncriminal trial is higher, the outcome of these criminal cases is evidence of the uphill\nbattle which class members would face in individual trials.\n,Even if the prisoners could factually establish their claims, the PLRA would\npreclude most of them from getting damages against those who violated their\nConstitutional  rights.  Under the PLRA, \"[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a\nprisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or\nemotional injury suffered  while in custody without a prior showing of physical  injury.\"\n42 U.S.C. § l997e(e).  At least one of the Circuit Courts of Appeals has interpreted the\nterm \"physical injury\" in a manner that would probably preclude recovery for\nemotional pain and suffering for the members of Groups A and B.  Siglar v.\nHìghtower,  112 F.3d 191, 193-94 (5th Cir. 1997) (sore, bruised ear was de minimus\ninjury and PLRA therefore barred recovery).  Because Groups A and B, by definition,\ninclude prisoners who did not experience significant physical injuries in Texas, these\nclass members' claims for damages for their emotional trauma could be barred by the\nPLRA.\n20  20\n\n816-931-1484r  KENNER & JPMES P. C.  ` '  521 P22  JfiN 19 '00  11:28\nThe PLRA would also deeply restrict this Court's ability to award  injunctive\nrelief if the class prevailed on the merits.  Under the statute, any injunction in a prison\ncase designed to prevent future harms is labeled \"prospective relief,\" and is subject to\nthe following limitations:\nProspective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall\nextend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a\nparticular plaintiff or plaintiffs.  The court shall not grant or approve any\nprospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn,\nextends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right,\nand is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\nright.\n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(l).  In addition, such relief must ordinarily terminate after two\nyears, unless a court finds that its continuation is \"narrowly drawn, extends no further  :\nthan necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive\nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"  § 3626(a)(2).  This\nrestriction would likely prevent the Court from enjoining the State of Missouri from\nsending prisoners to the State of Texas, because such an injunction would not be\nnarrowly drawn.  Because of the statute, the Court would likely be confined to less\nsweeping remedies, such as requiring the State of Missouri to investigate and monitor\nTexas facilities to which it would send groups of prisoners.  Even that kind of an\ninjunction would likely be dissolved after two years because of the PLRA's time\nlimitation.\n21  21\n\nn/~  •cMKico  «.

See, e.g.,  DiGidio v. Pung, 920 F.2d 525, 532 (8lh Cir. 1990).\nAn official exhibits sadism by \"delighting in cruelty,\" or inflicting pain \"for one's own\npleasure.\"  Parkus  v. Delo,  135 F.3d 1232, 1234 (8* Cir. 1998), cen.  denied, - U.S.\n-,  119 S. Ct.  152 (1998) {quoting Douglas v. Owens, 50 F.3d  1226, 1232-33 n.13 (3rd\nCir. l9<?5)).  Sometimes, even prisoners who have been subjected to abuse by guards\nfind their cases dismissed on summary judgment because they have failed to meet this\nvery high standard.  The case of Samuels v. Hawkins,  157 F.3d 557 (8th Cir. 1998) (M.\nArnold, dissenting), is illustrative.  In Samuels, a prisoner alleged that he was shackled\nto a cell bed on his back, with his arms chained and handcuffed  at his sides for four\nhours.  Id. at 558.  An officer then entered his cell and asked whether he was serving a\nlife sentence.  Id.  at 559.  When the prisoner responded that he was, the guard\nthreatened  \"I'm gonna make sure you never see again!\" and threw a cup of clear liquid\nat him.  Because of his restraints, the prisoner was unable to shield his face or his eyes.\nThe liquid caused the inmate's eyes to burn, and he feared that he would be blinded.\nNevertheless, the Eighth Circuit did not allow this case to be decided by a jury.  As a\nmatter of law, the guard's behavior was not malicious and sadistic.  Id. at 588.  Thus,\nthe excessive force claims of many of the class members may have been dismissed on\nsummary judgment.\n22\n\n816-931-1484ff`\"`E¯`NENNNEERR   &&  JJffiiMMEESS   PP..  CC..   ((   ••  521  P24  JRN  19\nMany of the prisoners' other claims, including their civil rights claims against\nthe officials  of the State of Missouri, would likely have been adjudicated under a\ndeliberate indifference  standard.3  Deliberate indifference  is actual knowledge of a\nsubstantial risk and an intentional disregard of that risk.  Farmer v. Brennan,  511 U.S.\n825, 837 (1994); Liebe v. Norton,  157 F.3d 574, 577 (8th Cir.  1998) (applying\ndeliberate indifference  standard to suit against state officials  for failure to protect\nprisone,r from abuse).

Although the Court has seen evidence of multiple complaints to State\nof Missouri officials,  it is far from certain that prisoners would have been able to prove\nthat these officials knew about the problems in Texas and intentionally ignored them¯.¯\nFinally, as previously noted, juries in this venue are generally unsympathetic to\nclaims by prisoners.  The testimony of Lisa Dahl and Richard Ralston at the fairness\nhearing leads to the conclusion that any verdicts awarded to the prisoners if their cases\nwere tried would not involve large awards of damages, even if significant injuries were\nproven.\nWeighed against the legal difficulties of the Plaintiffs1 case, the benefits provided\nin the settlement appear to be fair.

Furthermore, the nonmonetary\nrelief likely exceeds what this Coun would have the power to order if Plaintiffs won at\ntrial.6  Groups A and B almost certainly would receive no money if their cases were\ntried, but under the terms of the settlement they will benefit from the injunctive relief in\nthe settlement, and will also receive some compensation.  Group C would face\nsignificant risk if its cases were tried, but through settlement, Group C enjoys the same\ninjunctive relief as Groups A and B and will receive the majority of the money\nallocated to damages.  These monetary and nonmonetary benefits appear fair when\nweighed against the almost overwhelming legal and practical obstacles to recovery in\nindividual cases.

Under the PLRA, a consent decree is defined as \"any relief entered by\nthe court that is based in whole or in pan upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but\ndoes not include private settlements.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(l).  By contrast, a \"private\nsettlement\" is \"an agreement entered into among the parties that is not subject to judicial\nenforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled.M  §\n3626(g)(6).  Parties may enter private settlement agreements that do not comply with the\nlimitations on prospective relief that may be ordered by a court.  § 3626(c)(2).  Private\nsettlements are enforceable in state court.  § 3626(c)(2)(B); Austin v. Hopper, 28 F.Supp.2d\n1231, 1236 (M.D. Ala. 1998).  Both class counsel and defense counsel agree that the\nSettlement Agreement was intended to be a private settlement agreement.  Further, the\nSettlement Agreement specifically states that it shall be enforceable in Missouri state courts.\nHaving considered the parties' briefs, the Court therefore rules that the Settlement Agreement\nis a private settlement agreement that may be enforced in state court.  Further, the Settlement\nAgreement need not comply with the PLRA's limitations on prospective relief.  By settling, the\nPlaintiffs  clearly obtained more effective injunctive relief than they could have obtained from\nthe Court.\n24\n\n816-931-1484 OíNNER  & JfiMES  P.

The Defendants' Financial Condition, the Complexity and Expense\nof Further Litigation, and the Amount of Opposition to the Settlement\nThe financial condition of the Defendants generally weighs in favor of approving\nthe settlement.  Defendant CCRI contributed $2 million, which was the limit of its\ninsurance policy, as well as $100,000 from its excess carrier.  Other private Defendants\ncontributed a total of $120,000.  By all accounts, these amounts were agreed to by class\ncounsel only after days of grueling, face-to-face  negotiations.  Class counsel had\nserious concerns about the financial ability of the Defendant counties in Texas to\ncontribute any money whatsoever.  The State of Missouri, however, which contributed\nno money to the settlement, clearly had the financial ability to do so.  It is clear to the\nCourt, however, that the State would not have agreed to pay anything to settle these\ncases, regardless of its financial condition.\nThe complexity and expense of further litigation weighs strongly in favor of\napproval of the settlement.  While overseeing discovery in the consolidated cases, the\nCourt's resources were strained.  The parties' resources were stretched to the limit.\nCounsel examined thousands of pages of documents, responded to dozens of\ninterrogatories, and had begun the process of deposing more than a thousand witnesses.\n25\n\n816-931-1484f~ENNER  &  JfìMES P.

In all likelihood, the bulk of these\ncases would have been tried individually, assuming they survived summary judgment.\nFinally, the amount of opposition to the settlement weighs in favor of approving\nthe settlement.  The objectors represent only about 8 per cent of the class, and this\nrelatively low level of opposition to the settlement also indicates its fairness.  The Court\nhas an obligation not only to the minority of class members who filed objections, but\nalso to the majority who, by their silence, indicated their approval of the Settlement\nAgreement.

The Public Interest and the Objectors'  Arguments\nThe Court has also considered the public interest and the objectors' arguments\nand concludes that they do not warrant rejection of the Settlement Agreement.\n1.  The State of Missouri's Approach to This Litigation\nThe objectors' primary complaint about the settlement was the State of\nMissouri's attitude throughout this litigation.  Several objectors wanted the State to\naccept responsibility for what happened to them in Texas.  The Court construes this\nargument as a claim that the settlement violates the public interest by allowing a\nwrongdoer to go relatively unpunished.\n26\n2G\n\n816-931-1484 <¯ ¿NNER & JAMES P. C.  '  !  521 P28  -\nig 00\nSettlements, however, rarely involve admissions of liability or apologies, and\nthis one is no exception.  By its action, the State has acknowledged the problems in the\nTexas Cell Lease Program.  The State of Missouri has voluntarily retrieved all of its\nprisoners from the Texas Cell Lease Program.  In settlement, it has agreed not to send\nany prisoners to Texas except on an individual basis under the ICC.  It has also agreed\nnot to send any Missouri inmates to Texas facilities employing guards with criminal\nconvictions for assaulting prisoners and not to seek reimbursement from the settlement\nfund for the costs of incarcerating the class members.  Without such an agreement, the\nState could likely recover damages paid by the private prison facilities to the class\nmembers.  It is true that the Eighth Circuit has held that Missouri may not seek  -  • ·\nreimbursement from funds that the State pays to inmates with successful  claims under §\n1983.  See Hankins v. Finnel, 964 F.2d 853, 861 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 506 U.S.\n1013 (1992) (holding that § 1983 preempted the Missouri Incarceration Reimbursement\nAct).  However, that holding said nothing about whether Missouri could garnish funds\npaid to prisoners by a private jail company or officials  in another state.  Thus, in a real\nsense, the State of Missouri has given up more than $1 million to settle this case.\nGiven the significant,  if not overwhelming, relief offered  by the State in the Settlement\nAgreement, public policy does not compel rejection of the settlement.7\n7In the future,  it will also be difficult  for Missouri to claim ignorance of problems at an\nout-of-state or private facility if confronted with the kind and quantity of complaints it received\nas a result of the Texas Cell Lease Program.\n27\n\n816-931-1484V. £NNER 8. JAMES P. C.  -  521 P29  JRN ig •øø\n  11:31\n‰  Whether the Settlement Fund Will Adequately  Compensate\nClass Members\nMany objectors are concerned that the settlement provides insufficient  funds to\ncompensate the class members and that too much of the settlement funds have been\nallocated for attorney fees.  Some have argued that the attorney fees should not be\nsubtracted from the settlement funds at all, while others have noted that class counsel is\nseeking a higher proportion of the class settlement than their individual attorneys agreed\nto accept for litigating their individual cases.8  Finally, some have objected that their\nindividual attorneys will seek a percentage of their share of the settlement proceeds\nunder a contingent fee agreement, even though attorney fees have already been\nsubtracted from the settlement fund.  They state that it would be unfair to allow such a\ndouble recovery for the attorneys.  Because the issues of attorney fees and\ncompensation for the class members are interrelated, the Court considers them\ntogether.\nThe Settlement Agreement purports to allocate almost 41 percent of the\nsettlement fund, or $900,000 to attorney fees.  It also includes $300,000 for costs and\nclass administration expenses.  If this request were granted, fees and costs9 would\n'Class counsel in this case originally represented individual plaintiffs under contingent\nfee agreements.\n'Evidence was presented at the fairness hearing that costs were expected to consume all\nof the $300,000 allocated to them.\n28 28\n\nr·  C\n816-931-1484V  ,tNNER & JONES P.C.  521 P30  jfiN  .\n ig 00  11:31\nconsume 54 percent of the settlement proceeds, leaving $1,020,000 to be distributed\namong the 2100 class members.  Because the amount of attorney fees to be paid from a\ncommon fund is for the Court to determine, Johnston v. Comerica Mortgage  Corp.,  83\nF.3d 241 (8th Cir.  1996); In re General Motors Corp, Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prod.\nLiab. Litig.,  55 F.3d 768, 819 (3rd Cir.  1995); In re The Prudential Ins.  Co. of Am.\nSales Practices Litig.,  962 F. Supp. 572 (D.N.J.  1997) the Court will construe the\nSettlement Agreement and the documentation presented by class counsel at the fairness\nhearing as a request for attorney fees and expenses in the amount of $1,200,000.\nWhen awarding attorney fees in class actions, courts must ensure that class\ncounsel are compensated adequately but not excessively:\nSince in most class actions the fees have been deducted from the total class\nrecovery under the \"equitable fund\" theory (in connection with Rule 23), the\nprimary concern has been to establish standards which can be used to insure that\nthese awards reasonably compensate the attorneys for their services yet are not\nexcessive, arbitrary, or detrimental with respect to the class.\nGrunin, 513 F.2d at 127.  In class action cases, courts may use either a \"lodestar\"\nmethod or a \"percentage of benefit\" method to calculate reasonable fees.  Johnston,  83\nF.3d at 245.  The lodestar method is based on \"the consideration of hours and rates.\"\nId.  In applying this method, courts multiply a reasonable number of hours for a case\nby a reasonable rate for the attorneys' work.  Under the percentage of benefit method,\ncourts may issue \"an award of fees that is equal to some fraction of the common fund\n29\n  23\n\nr`  ™r-c  D r  C~``'  521  P3l  JfiN  19  '00\n816-931-14B4(  HNNER & JAMES P. C.\nthat the attorneys were successful in gathering during the course of the litigation.\"  Id\nat 244-45.\nIn \"common fund\" cases, where attorney fees and class members are distributed\nfrom one fund,  the Eighth Circuit has indicated that a percentage of the benefit method\nmay be preferable to the lodestar method.  Id. at 245;  accord Camden I Condominium\nAss'n,  Inc.  v. Dunkle,  946 F.2d 768, 774 (11th Cir.  1991).  The Supreme Court has\nindicated, in dicta,  that this method should be applied in common fund cases.  Blum v.\nStenson,  465 U.S. 886, 900 n.16 (1984) (\"Unlike the calculation of attorney's fees\nunder the 'common fimd doctrine,' where a reasonable fee is based on a percentage of\nthe fund bestowed on the class, a reasonable fee under § 1988 reflects the amount of  --•••\nattorney time reasonably expended on the litigation.\").  A Third Circuit task force\nconcluded that the percentage of benefit method should be applied in common fund\ncases for the following reasons:\n[A] key element of the common fund case is that fees are not assessed against the\nunsuccessful  litigant (fee shifting), but rather, are taken from the fund or damage\nrecovery (fee spreading).  Furthermore, in contrast to the calculation of a\nstatutory fee, payable by the defendant depending on the extent of success\nachieved, a common fund is itself the measure of success ... [and] represents the\nbenchmark on which a reasonable fee will be awarded.  Consequently, the\nanalysis in a common fund case focuses not on the plaintiffs'  position as\n\"prevailing parties,\" but on a showing that the fund conferring a benefit on-the\nclass resulted from their efforts.  In this context, monetary results achieved\npredominate over all other criteria.\n30\n30\n\n/-¯Nr^«)  g  TöMPq P r  O  521 P32  JfiN  19  •00  11:32\n816-931-1484f  `ENNER & JñMES P. C.  `·\nCamden /, 946 F.2d at 774 (citing H. Newberg, Attorney Fee Awards §§ 2.06-07\n(1986)).\nBecause this is a common fund case, the percentage of benefit method should be\napplied.  Also, applying a lodestar method in this case would not create a particularly\naccurate or scientific result, given the extreme difficulty  of determining the number of\nattorney hours that advanced the settlement of the class action, as opposed to time spent\npursuing claims of individual clients.  The attorneys have not even attempted to divide\ntheir time in this manner, and the Court would simply have to guess at a reasonable\nnumber of hours to apply a lodestar method.  Furthermore, the PLRA indicates that\nattorney fees awarded in prison cases should be proportional to the benefit obtained.  42\nU.S.C. § l997e(d)(l)(B)(i).\nGenerally, the percentage of a common fond allocated to attorney fees is\nbetween 20 to 30 percent, but this percentage may be higher or lower depending upon\nthe particular circumstances of individual cases.  Camden I, 946 F.2d at 774 {citing\nNewberg, at §2.08).  The following factors should be considered:  (1) The time and\nlabor required; (2) The novelty and difficulty  of the questions; (3) The skill requisite to\nperform the legal service properly; (4) The preclusion of other employment by the\nattorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) The customary fee for similar work in the\ncommunity; (6) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) Time limitations imposed by\nthe client or the circumstances; (8) The amount involved and the results obtained; (9)\n31\n\n816-931-1484 ^`<ENNER  8.

In addition, courts should consider \"the time\n.required^ to reach settlement, whether there are substantial objections by class members\nor other parties to settlement terms or the fees requested, any nonmonetary benefits\nconferred upon the class by the settlement, and the economics involved in prosecuting\nclass action.\"  Camden /, 946 F.2d at 775.\nVirtually all of these factors counsel a fee award higher than the customary 20 to\n30 percent range in this class action.  Class counsel expended considerable time and\nlabor on this case, which presented novel and difficult  legal questions during discovery.\nThe arduous discovery process precluded most other employment by class counsel.\nThe fee was contingent rather than fixed.  The attorneys were some of the best in\nMissouri, and they represented prisoners, one of the least popular groups of clients.  In\naddition, settlement negotiations consumed a significant amount of time, and the class\nreceived important nonmonetary benefits.  Indeed, but for the skillful work of these\ndedicated lawyers, it is likely that only a handful of inmates would have obtained any\nmonetary relief.\n32\n\nQ!6-931-1484-XENhER  & JAMES P. C. 521  P34  JñN  19\nThe objectors' arguments, however, persuade the Court that class counsel should\nreceive less than the $900,000 percent requested.  Although class counsel spent many\nhours litigating this case, just compensation in a common fund case is determined more\nby the benefits obtained for the class than the number of hours expended.  The Court is\nalso concerned that the fees requested exceeds the amount included in some contingent\nfee agreements.  Finally, it is uncertain whether the funds allocated to compensate the\nclass members will be sufficient.  As explained earlier, members of Groups A and B\nwould be unlikely to receive any compensation for their treatment in Texas in the\nabsence of this settlement.  However, Group C may run a risk of under compensation.\nThe Settlement Agreement allocates $820,000 to Group C.  Class counsel identified 59  -\npotential members of Group C from among the 700 Plaintiffs who have already filed\nsuit.  After the videotapes were discovered, it was well known that lawyers were\naccepting clients who had been imprisoned in Texas.  It, therefore, stands to reason that\nmost of the prisoners who suffered  significant physical injuries would have contacted\none or more of these attorneys.  However, as class counsel acknowledged at the\nfairness hearing, no one knows exactly how many of the 1400 unrepresented class\nmembers may also belong in Group C.  Furthermore, although the majority of the\nknown members of Group C seem to have suffered only mild or moderate injuries,\nsome may have suffered  severe injury.  To ensure that these class members are\nsufficiently  compensated, and for the other reasons mentioned, the Court will approve\n33\n33\n\n816-931-1484 /~-'ENNER & JONES P. C.

Under the terms of the\nSettlement Agreement, an additional $100,000 would then be allocated to Group C.\nAny excess funds in Group C would then be shared with Groups A and B.  The class\nas a whole, would thereby receive more than half of the settlement fund, or\n$1,120,000.\nThe funds used to compensate class members should be free from any further\nclaims by attorneys.  See Walitalo v. lacocca,  968 F.2d 741, 749 (8th Cir. 1992)\n(attorneys' fee award in class action should evaluate whether Plaintiffs'  fee\narrangements with individual counsel should be modified).  The cases in which  -\nattorneys represented individual Plaintiffs, rather than the class, will be barred by the\nclass action settlement.  Those individual cases did not result in any recovery for the\nindividual Plaintiffs,  and those attorneys should not be entitled to a share of the funds\nawarded to the class members under the settlement of this case.\n3.  Whether Class Members Should be Allowed to Opt Out of the\nSettlement and the Appropriateness of Class  Certification\nOn July 29, 1999, this Court conditionally certified  a mandatory, no opt-out\nclass pursuant to Federal Rule of CÌYÜ Procedure 23(b)(2).

Having read the objections filed by\nsome class members and having listened to the testimony of the objectors at the fairness\nhearing, the Court remains convinced that a mandatory, no opt out class action is\nproper under the Federal Rules of Civil. Procedure and the United States Constitution\nand is the most fair and effective means of resolving the dispute.\nA mandatory class under subsection (b)(2) is appropriate \"if classwide injunctive\nrelief is sought when the defendant 'has acted or refused to act on grounds generally\napplicable to the class.\"1  DeBoer,  64 F.3d at 1175 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)).\nTo meet the requirements of subsection (b)(2), \"[the] putative class [must] demonstrate\nthat the interests of the class members are so like those of the individual representatives\nthat injustice will not result from their being bound by such judgment in subsequent\napplication of the principles of res judicaîa.\"  Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 179\n(3rd Cir.  1988).  A class may be certified under subsection (b)(2) even when damages\nare sought incidentally to the prayer for equitable relief, DeBoer, 64 F.3d at 1175.\nHowever, certification under (b)(2) \"does not extend to cases in which the appropriate\nfinal relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2) advisory committee's note to 1986 amendment.  On the other hand, a\nsubstantial damage award should not preclude certification of a (b)(2) class seeking\npredominantly equitable relief.  See Thomas v. Albright,  139 F.3d 227, 235 (D.C.\n35\n35\n\n816-931-1484^- 'ENNER  & JfiMES  P. C.  (¯`)  521  P37  j   .\nfìN  ig  00\nCir.), cert, denied, 119 S. Ct. 539 (1998); Stewart v. Rubin, 948 F.

As many objectors told the Court at the\nfairness hearing, their primary concern is not money.  Rather, the objectors want to\nensure .that they are never again sent to Texas under the conditions that existed in the\nTexas Cell Lease Program, and they want to protect future inmates from similar\nexperiences.14  The injunctive relief provided in the settlement addresses these concerns\nby limiting when and under what conditions Missouri prisoners can be transferred  out\nof state and by providing a means of redressing conduct violations unfairly  imposed\nwhile the class members were in Texas.  These liberty concerns substantially outweigh\nquestions of money.  Furthermore, while the monetary relief provided in the settlement\nis significant,  the State of Missouri will be enjoined by the terms of the settlement from\nconfiscating all of that monetary relief as reimbursement for costs of incarceration\npursuant to the Missouri Reimbursement Incarceration Act, R.S.Mo. §§ 217.825, et\nseq.  This injunctive relief effectively  offsets the monetary relief which is contemplated\nby the settlement.  Finally, one of the primary reasons that Rule 23(b)(2) certification\nKAt the fairness hearing, even Daniel Owsley, one of the more seriously injured objectors,\nindicated a greater concern about the State of Missouri's policies than about his own injuries.\n36\n3G\n\n816-931-1484,\" 'ENNER 8.

See 7A WRIGHT, MILLER & KANE,\nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE,  Civil 2d, § 1775 (1986).  Class certification in\nthis case is consistent with both the text and intent of Rule 23(b)(2).\nThe Court is aware that the U.S. Supreme Court has recently expressed concern\nabout the use of class actions to resolve mass tort claims.  The Supreme Court's two\noverarching concerns have been whether the class is adequately represented and\nwhether the class is sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.t5  In\nthis case, all the class members are readily identified.  Their claims are temporally and\ngeographically circumscribed.  Unlike some of the recent mass tort class actions which\nhave been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court, this class action does not involve\nunpredictable damages that may arise in the future, or involve claimants that are yet\nunborn.  Moreover, most of the legal theories asserted in the class complaint apply\ncomprehensively to the class.  For example, the resolution of the breach of\ncontract/third party beneficiary claim would affect all members of the class.  Whether\nor not DOC officials were deliberately indifferent to the needs of the Missouri prisoners\nin Texas would have more to do with the treatment of the class as a whole than the\nl5The Supreme Court has also made it clear that compliance with Rule 23 is required.

As to the civil rights claims raised by the class,\nit would be issues of liability and common damages that would predominate if this class\naction were litigated rather than settled.  Furthermore, the risks associated with\nindividual litigation are more easily predicted when the class consists of a group of\nplaintiffs that are perceived by society in stereotypical ways.\nThe class has also been skillfully and fairly represented by class counsel.  The\nSettlement Agreement is not a Ptomkin village, designed for the purpose of deception.\nIt is not like those class actions where the named plaintiffs  receive a more favorable\nsettlement than class members who were not parties to the original suit.  Prior to the\nfiling of the class complaint, class counsel individually represented prisoners from  -\nGroups A, B & C and it is clear that the interests of each group have been carefully\nprotected in the settlement.  In fact,  the prisoners in Group C, who by definition have\nthe greatest injury, and hence, are at the greatest risk of undercompensation, were\nprobably all represented by individual counsel prior to the settlement.  Not only is the\nsettlement a fair resolution of the dispute, but the interests of all members of the class .\nwere vigorously defended during the litigation and settlement process.  Each class\nmember received notice of the settlement and had an effective way to bring their\nobjections to the Court.  The interests of the objectors were also expertly represented\nby appointed counsel at the fairness hearing.\n38\n\n816-931-1484  XENNER  & JAMES P.

The class is not so large as to sweep in unknown, unknowable and largely\nunpredictable claims, but sufficiently  large to pose an untenable burden for the class,\nthe defendants, the Court and thereby indirectly the community.  This is also a class\nthat may not have the resources to pursue their claims individually, but as a group can\neffectively  redress their grievances.  Finally, the due process rights of the class have\nbeen vigilantly protected.\nIV.
