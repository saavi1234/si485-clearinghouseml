This case was consolidated with a similar case filed on November 15, 1989, by another set of prisoners of the state of Colorado.  The prisoners had been transferred to the Western Missouri Correctional Center pursuant to a contract between the two states.  They alleged that they had been unconstitutionally deprived of their liberty without due process of law because they were being held in a protective custody segregation unit without being afforded the same general privileges provided to inmates in the general prison population, as required by Missouri prison regulations.</p><p>On May 11, 1990, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri (Judge Howard Sachs) ordered that the Colorado inmates should be treated by the same standards as the Missouri inmates, holding that the prison regulation requiring substantial equality of privileges among prisoners created a protected liberty interest, and that substantial disparity in treatment of prisoners deprived the prisoners of their protected interests.  Madden v. Kemna 739 F.Supp. 1358 (E.D.Mo. 1990).  On June 11, 1991, the court dismissed the case with prejudice, ordering each party to bear its own costs.  </p><p></p>",

Missouri, W.D.\nMay 11, 1990.\nSteven G. Emerson, Morris & Larson, P.C., Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiffs.\nThomas A. Sheehan and Claudia J. York, Shughart, Thomson & Kilroy, P.C., Kansas City, Mo., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nSACHS, District Judge.\nThese consolidated cases were brought by some twenty-five prisoners from Colorado who have been transferred\nto Western Missouri Correctional Center (Cameron) from their home state, pursuant to a contract for\nimprisonment here. Plaintiffs are before the court on motions for a preliminary injunction. They contend they have\nbeen deprived of liberty interests without due process of law in that they are being held in a protective custody\nsegregation unit as requested by them, but without being afforded the same general privileges provided inmates\nin the general prison population as generally mandated by Missouri prison regulations. It is contended that prison\nauthorities have neither asserted nor shown any security needs for such inequality of privileges or any lack of\navailable resources which would provide a regulatory justification for the conduct of such officials.\n1359 *1359 Defendants are Mike Kemna, superintendent of the Cameron facility, and the Missouri Department of\nCorrections and Human Resources, which is charged with the responsibility for the administration of all\n[1]\ncorrectional institutions within the state.  Defendants' brief, filed May 9, 1990, contains some useful factual and\nprocedural statements and arguments, and quotations used in this memorandum without attribution are taken\nfrom that brief.\n\"These cases were originally filed by plaintiffs pro se. However, the court appointed counsel for plaintiffs in\nDecember of 1989. The first matter taken up by plaintiffs' counsel after his appointment concerned plaintiffs'\nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief. At that time, the court requested that plaintiffs' counsel inform the court\nwhether there was a necessity to have a hearing on plaintiffs' initial request for emergency injunctive relief.\nFollowing discussions between counsel, defendants' counsel informed plaintiffs' counsel that the present\navailable resources and ability to address plaintiffs' security concerns allowed defendants to provide some\nadditional privileges defendants were previously unable to provide. Specifically, defendants determined that\nprotective custody inmates were numerous enough to be placed in a unit of their own with open movement\n(Housing Unit 2), and protective custody inmates could be escorted to the gym, the law library and food service.\nHowever, defendants were unable to provide organized religious services or more than two hours per week of\nphone access. Following these discussions, plaintiffs' counsel informed defendants' counsel and the court that a\nhearing on plaintiffs' request for emergency relief was not necessary.\n\"Thereafter, although plaintiffs' counsel indicated a desire to further discuss a final resolution of this case, except\nfor one or two requests to check into a specific complaint by an individual plaintiff, no further discussions were\n\ninitiated by plaintiffs' counsel until April 26, 1990, when defendants' counsel met with plaintiffs' counsel to review\nplaintiffs' [new] complaints.\n\"While these discussions were occurring, [allegedly] because of a change in resources available at Western\nMissouri Correctional Center, and because of the security needs of the plaintiffs, they were transferred to\nHousing Unit 1 which houses disciplinary segregation inmates and inmates being received into the prison prior to\ntheir classification in general population. This transfer, which was occasioned by the transfer of Missouri\nprotective custody inmates to another institution at Farmington and the receipt of additional Missouri general\npopulation inmates was [allegedly] necessary because of the need for space in Housing Unit 2 and the continuing\nprotective custody needs asserted by the plaintiffs.\n\"Plaintiffs argue that they have certain fundamental rights in certain privileges guaranteed by the Constitution and\nthat they should receive the same privileges and/or treatment as general population inmates. Further, they argue\nthat the Department regulations, in specific and mandatory language, require more privileges than they receive,\nand that these regulations afford plaintiffs a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment which\nrequires that defendants provide them the same privileges as they have received in the past or have been\nprovided to general population inmates.\n1360 *1360 \"Defendants have argued ... that plaintiffs have neither a constitutional right nor a liberty interest in the\nprivileges they seek to have mandated by this court. This is because they have no constitutional right to such\nprivileges and, even if a liberty interest has been created by the regulations of the Department of Corrections,\nplaintiffs have failed to prove that the defendants have failed to follow their own regulations to the extent that the\nplaintiffs have been denied due process.\"\nWhen the lawsuit was filed, plaintiffs were in Housing Unit 1, sometimes referred to as \"the hole,\" and were\nlocked down virtually all of each twenty-four hour day, including meal times and times when general population\nprisoners were free to use library facilities, recreational facilities, and to engage in normal social interaction.\nPlaintiffs were thereafter moved to a protective custody wing of Housing Unit 2, and while some ongoing\ncomplaints may have been unresolved, the totality of circumstances did not call for prompt judicial intervention,\nand none was sought. Plaintiffs were returned to Unit 1 on April 25, 1990, and counsel sought emergency relief\non April 27, 1990. After consolidation of the cases a preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled and conducted\non May 3, 1990. Further filings have been permitted, received and considered.\nPlaintiff Smith, a representative plaintiff, testified at the hearing. Among other things he testified to conditions in\nColorado that caused him to seek protective custody, and testified that one or more dangerous enemies of his is\nin the general population at Cameron. His complaints about conditions at Unit 1 are many. The cell in which he is\nhoused is essentially stripped of furnishings other than a bunk and mattress and toilet facilities and a sink. There\nare no electrical outlets permitting use of television sets, which severely restricts communication from the outside\nworld. Telephone facilities are restricted. Smith has pro se litigation in progress in Colorado but is unable to visit\nthe law library or to obtain legal material other than by restricted, highly limited contacts with a visiting paralegal\nassistant. Recreational use of a gymnasium has been terminated. Smith believes the loss of educational,\nrehabilitative or vocational training time will prevent accrual of time counted in determining his parole date. Food\nis provided on trays slipped through the door to the cell. The method of supplying food carried by members of the\ngeneral prison population allows intentional contamination by enemies, including spitting into the trays. Smith\ncomplains that a recommended operation for a possible or potential cancerous rectal condition has been denied.\nShowers are allowed from 1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., apparently not the hours allocated to protective custody\nprisoners prior to the retransfer to Unit 1. One or more guards has reportedly used threatening language.\n[2]\nCommunion has been unavailable.\nSuperintendent Kemna, called as an adverse witness, testified that the current lockdown is complete on two days\nduring the week, and lasts for approximately 23 hours daily during the remaining five days. Unit 1 is used for the\nmost severe disciplinary punishment at Cameron. Plaintiffs are restricted in the same manner as disciplinary\nprisoners, except that visitors are allowed plaintiffs (who generally have no visitors from this area). Plaintiffs were\nretransferred to Unit 1 when some 40 protective custody prisoners from Missouri were transferred to the\nFarmington facility. The wing in Unit 2 formerly occupied by plaintiffs was then released for use by the general\n\npopulation, consisting of some 1900 prisoners. Additional prisoners were sent to the Cameron facility to occupy\nthe wing formerly used by plaintiffs.\nPrisoners in Unit 1 cannot visit the canteen but can order from lists, although there are complaints that orders\nhave not been taken or filled. Telephoning is limited to ten minutes during the one to two hour period of recreation\n1361 daily which is apparently the only scheduled time during the week when the Unit 1 prisoners are released *1361\nfrom their cells. They do not go to the main gymnasium. General population prisoners may attend various\nclasses, including vocational training, and may attend religious services and meetings of approved groups such\nas Alcoholics Anonymous. Sick call does not include a time for the Unit 1 prisoners, but they are to be visited at\ntheir cells by doctors when a justifiable request is made.\nMark Jacob, unit manager of Unit 1, testified that he anticipates that plaintiffs will be returned to Colorado before\nthe end of July. Kemna testified, presumably with greater knowledge, that the first week of July would be the\nperiod when plaintiffs would be released for retransfer. Jacob testified that showering in the middle of the night is\n[3]\nconvenient to the prisoners, who are awake at that time and sleep until late morning.  No legal books are\navailable for study in the cells; at best it appears that limited pages of photocopied material are supplied. This\nimplies that normal reading material such as books would also be unavailable in the cells, thus aggravating the\nabsence of television and all other outside communication. Except for restricted yard exercise, the situation may\nbe characterized as essentially \"solitary confinement.\" Jacob denied a claim that he had threatened to tear-gas\nthe plaintiffs and further denied that he had made threats in jest. For present purposes the denial will be\naccepted, although a number of affidavits dispute Jacob.\nThe court inquired at the hearing whether the Department had some articulable need to transfer protective\ncustody inmates to Farmington in a manner that would cause closing of the Unit 2 wing to the Colorado inmates.\nNo explanation has been tendered. Subsequent to my leaving the hearing Kemna simply said for the record that\n\"our original effort was ... to rid ourselves of the protective custody unit.\" Neither a security problem nor shortage\nof resources (except as self-inflicted) has been cited for the damaging conduct. Superintendent Kemna did testify\nthat Unit 1 facilities had been approved by the deputy director for operations of the Colorado penal system,\nGeorge E. Sullivan. While the facility may have been approved for disciplinary purposes or for brief temporary\nuse, it is very difficult to believe that Sullivan gave approval of the use of Unit 1 for protective custody prisoners\nexpected to remain there for many months or for approximately one year, under the conditions described by all\n[4]\nthe witnesses.  In any event, plaintiffs do not rest their claim on any violation of the contract or other agreement\nwith Colorado authorities.\nII.\nTurning to a legal analysis of the issues, the pleadings assert (1) denial of reasonable opportunities to exercise\nreligious freedoms, (2) denial of access to essential legal materials and legal assistance, (3) denial of access to\nadequate medical and dental care, (4) denial of access to needed mental health care, (5) denial of adequate\nvocational, educational and rehabilitation programs, (6) denial of access to adequate telephone facilities, (7)\ndenial of access to adequate grievance procedures, and (8) subjection to harassment and retaliation because of\n1362 the present court action. Plaintiffs *1362 also assert that defendants' conduct \"enumerated above and the general\ndisparate treatment of protective custody inmates violates plaintiffs' liberty interests protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment in that defendants' conduct violates MDCR 20-1612.020.7, which provides in part that `inmates\nhoused in protective custody segregation units shall be afforded the same general privileges provided inmates in\n[5]\ngeneral population, as is consistent with existing available resources and the security needs of the institution.'\"\nDefendants specifically respond to the exercise of religion, access to the courts, security and protection and\nmedical and dental care issues. More generally, they assert that \"the due process clause itself creates no interest\nin an inmate to remain in the general prison population,\" citing Tyler v. Black, 811 F.2d 424, 427 (8th Cir. 1987),\nwhich in turn relies on Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 467-8, 103 S.Ct. 864, 869-70, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). They\nfurther contend that the cited regulation is insufficiently \"specific\" in its \"substantive predicates\" to limit the fullest\nexercise of discretion by prison authorities. Kentucky Department of Corrections v. Thompson, ___ U.S. ___, 109\nS.Ct. 1904, 1909-10, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989). Finally, they assert that resources to accommodate plaintiffs in\n\ntheir right to substantially equal privileges disappeared, once the transfer of some 40 out of a group of some 65\nprotective custody prisoners occurred.\nOn preliminary injunction analysis, I must determine whether plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits, when the\ncase has been fully prepared and submitted. Nordin v. Nutri/System, Inc., 897 F.2d 339, 354 (8th Cir.1990).\nTaking the common problems of the plaintiffs, it seems less than likely that any naked rule of constitutional law\nhas been violated. There is, however, a material chance that severely disparate treatment of protective custody\nprisoners would suffice. Williams v. Lane, 851 F.2d 867 (7th Cir.1988). Compare, Tyler v. Black, 811 F.2d 424,\n433-5 (8th Cir.1987) (23-hour daily confinement of prisoners in a closed-front cell, where the court held that the\n[6]\nextreme isolation imposed may have had \"a devastating effect on the mental health of inmates so confined\").  It\nis somewhat difficult to understand why a severe disparity should be permitted, merely for convenience, or even\nas an economy measure, any more than such severe disparity would be permitted, for example, as between a\nmen's institution and a women's institution.\nI do find a severe disparity on the material presented to me. It would be overly generous to defendants to\nconclude that the protective custody prisoners enjoy two-thirds of the privileges available to the general prison\npopulation; a 50% ratio in the quality of living conditions seems more likely, judging the totality of conditions, as \nTyler v. Black teaches is appropriate.\nPlaintiffs have clearly presented a prima facie violation of the mandatory regulation, generally requiring\nsubstantial equality of privileges. Missouri Department of Corrections Reg. 20-1612.020(7). P.Exh. 2, quoted\nabove. Plaintiffs certainly do not enjoy \"the same general privileges provided inmates in general population,\" and\neven if it be assumed they have the further obligation to show that the restrictions do not naturally flow from some\nrestriction on \"existing available resources\" or from \"the security needs of the institution,\" there is no present\nreason to believe that either security or lack of resources lies at the root of the deprivation. Defendants have\nelected, without explanation, to reshuffle the prison population so as to phase out the protective custody unit at\nCameron; by defendants' volition the difficult situation for plaintiffs has been created. This plainly violates, in my\n1363 judgment, the major lesson of the rule, which is designed to prevent any unnecessary and substantial disparate \n[7]\n*1363 treatment.  If there is some sound explanation that would allow defendants to assert lack of resources,\nfor example, as an excuse, that may be developed before the damage suit is heard on the merits. On the present\nrecord, plaintiffs are very likely to prevail, and to satisfy the other requirements for relief pending litigation.\nThe regulation relied on is sufficiently mandatory and sufficiently definite to create a protected liberty interest\n[8]\nunder the Constitution, as presently construed. Taylor v. Armontrout, 894 F.2d 961 (8th Cir. 1989).  There is\nexplicitly mandatory language and adequate guidelines serving to limit official discretion. Examples can be found\nwhere somewhat vague language that is less capable of objective determination than that here used has been\nconsidered sufficient to show that unrestricted discretion has been abolished by the State itself. Compare, Clark\nv. Brewer, 776 F.2d 226, 230-2 (8th Cir.1985). The prison officials thus appear to have deprived plaintiffs of a\nliberty interest without due process of law. I am convinced on the present record that they have seriously\nmisapplied the regulation at bar, in relying on an artificial contrivance rather than an unfortunate situation which\nthey were unable to prevent or handle equitably. In any event they have made no effort to equalize the impact of\nany hardship and have forced the entire deprivation on 25 individuals rather than on all the 2000 prisoners\nhoused at Cameron.\nIII.\nThe matter of relief is the most baffling part of this case in its present posture. It seems clear that plaintiffs should\nnot be held in \"solitary confinement\" any longer than necessary, and the best solution would doubtless be their\nreturn to Colorado in a matter of a few days. Plaintiffs' counsel has suggested another form of quick relief, by\ntransferring the disciplinary prisoners from Unit 1 to another institution, thus allowing Unit 1 to become a\nprotective custody facility with conditions roughly comparable to those existing in Unit 2 before the April 25\ntransfers. Perhaps the Colorado authorities would authorize the transfer of plaintiffs to Farmington, and\nFarmington could accept them without overcrowding. Simply opening the doors of the cells, as was allegedly\ndone for the visit of Mr. Sullivan, might go a long way toward meeting the major problem, as perceived by the\n\ncourt, but it is recognized that Mr. Kemna rejected this as lacking in feasibility in May, although Sullivan\nunderstood it was the standard operating procedure in October.\nThe court will not try to present defendants with a list of items they should resolve in a particularized manner.\nApart from avoiding unnecessary intrusiveness, I believe the record is too sketchy to permit evaluation of the\nclaims of each plaintiff, and the court has reached its conclusion based on totality-analysis.\nIt is concluded that the court should simply order defendants to comply with their own regulation, taking into\naccount Department-wide resources. This should be sufficiently definite in phrasing to permit understanding\ncompliance, particularly with the gloss added by this opinion. It should also prevent a voluntary shifting of\nresources between facilities to serve as an excuse for imposing inequitable hardships.\nIt is therefore ORDERED that, pending litigation, defendants Kemna and the director of the Department of\n1364 Corrections shall promptly, and within no more than *1364 ten (10) days (unless the time is extended by the court\nfor some compelling reason) comply with the Missouri prison regulation mandating that the Colorado inmates\npresently housed in protective custody segregation at Cameron, Missouri, be afforded the same general\nprivileges provided inmates in the general prison population, consistently with existing available resources of the\nDepartment of Corrections and the security needs of the Department. It is further\n[9]\nORDERED that, no measurable monetary harm to defendants being shown,  and no material availability of\nplaintiffs' funds being established, no bond shall be required as a condition of preliminary injunctive relief in this\ncase.\n[1] Whether the Department is subject to a damage suit under the Eleventh Amendment is a subject of a pending\nmotion to dismiss, but is not in serious question insofar as injunctive relief is sought against the officials of that\nDepartment. Ford v. Lane, 714 F.Supp. 310 (N.D. Ill.1989). It may be better practice to describe the officials by\ntitle (Rule 25(d)(2), Fed.R.Civ. P.), but at this stage in litigation it may be unknown who within the Department\ncaused certain transfers of other protective custody prisoners to Farmington, with knowledge of the probable\neffect on these plaintiffs. Mr. Kemna doubtless had such knowledge, and there is no evidence that he protested\nto his superiors at the Department or otherwise attempted to assure that plaintiffs would not be denied the\nequality of conditions generally mandated by Missouri prison regulations hereinafter discussed. As a matter of\ncareful practice injunctive relief will be directed toward Kemna and the director of the Department of Corrections.\n[2] Testimony from Chaplain Jones tends to establish that arrangements have now been completed for individual\ncommunion, beginning the first weekend in May.\n[3] The credibility of this testimony may be questioned. While some of the prisoners may of course be \"night\nowls,\" it seems extremely unlikely that a majority of the Unit 1 prisoners remain wakeful during solitary conditions\nexisting in their cells at 1:00-4:00 a.m. Affidavits show that individual plaintiffs are awakened for showers.\n[4] The Sullivan letter of October 13, 1989, labels as \"FALSE\" the claim that protective custody prisoners are\nsubject to what approximates a \"24-hour lockdown,\" and asserts that \"the protective custody unit has a rather\nlarge and common area space which is available to assigned inmates upon request.\" (Emphasis added.) He\nmade an observation that five such prisoners \"were in the common area space talking and lounging upon our\narrival in the unit,\" and noted library books and presumably operational television sets in the cells. At the hearing\nSuperintendent Kemna rejected the feasibility of allowing protective custody prisoners out of their cells \"upon\nrequest,\" thus acknowledging drastically different conditions from what Sullivan observed. The Sullivan visit may\nhave occurred during the limited recreation period, but the misunderstanding of a critical issue is indeed strange.\n[5] Other constitutional violations are asserted but need not be evaluated in that the strongest contention here\nstated is deemed sufficient.\n[6] This portion of the opinion has been withdrawn, where radio reception in the cells is available. Tyler v. Black,\n865 F.2d 181, 184 (8th Cir. en banc 1989).\n\n[7] Even if resource limitations mandated a reduction of privileges, no effort to equitably distribute the loss has\noccurred. If protective custody inmates are confined to Unit 1 for ten days, the general population inmates might\nbe chosen in some manner for similar deprivation for similar short periods. If this seems bizarre, some ingenuity\nby prison officials seriously committed to equalizing conditions could doubtless alleviate the disparity problem in\nanother manner.\n[8] The Eighth Circuit rule seems more favorable to prisoners than I concluded in Williams v. McClain, 708\nF.Supp. 1086, 1088 n. 1 (W.D.Mo. 1989). I was there enunciating what the Supreme Court calls a \"bright line\"\ntest, not yet adopted according to Kentucky Department of Corrections, 109 S.Ct. at 1909 n. 3.\n[9] On the contrary, each day's delay in providing relief adds to defendants' exposure to damages and attorneys'\nfees.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
