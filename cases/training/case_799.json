    "summary": "<p>On July 12, 2002, death row inmates at the Mississippi State Penitentiary filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi against the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC).  Plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and private attorneys.  The suit alleged that the inmates were subjected to isolation, lack of exercise, inadequate ventilation, unsanitary conditions, and lack of mental heath care. On July 15, 2002, Chief Judge Glen H. Davidson denied plaintiffs' motion for temporary relief and preliminary injunction to stop the execution of one of the plaintiffs.  Russell v. Johnson, 210 F.Supp.2d 804 (N.D. Miss. 2002). On July 18, 2002, Judge Davidson issued an order incorporating this case into Gates, et al v. Collier, et al (PC-MS-001), an ongoing prisoners' rights class action.  On October 25, 2002, Magistrate Judge Jerry A. Davis consolidated the cases, naming these plaintiffs a sub-class in Gates.  </p><p>Following a non-jury trial, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Davis) found that there were constitutional violations in the areas of ventilation, sanitation, lighting, laundry services, and mental health care.  Russell v. Johnson, 2003 WL 22208029 (N.D. Miss. May 21, 2003).  Judge Davis ordered the defendants to ensure that inmates not be required to clean their own cell when they move into one, provide inmates with cleaning supplies, create a maintenance schedule, provide inmates with fans when the temperature is above 90 degrees, improve plumbing and laundry conditions, and provide each inmate with a private mental health evaluation.  Defendants appealed.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Judge James L. Dennis) affirmed in part and vacated in part the District Court's judgment.  Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323 (5th Cir. 2004).  After holding that the district court did not err in allowing this case to proceed separately from Gates v. Collier, No. 71-6 (PC-MS-1), the Court of Appeals addressed the merits, and held that the unsanitary condition in cells, the temperature of the cells, and inadequate lighting were all constitutional violations, but that laundry conditions were not serious enough to rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  The Appeals Court also found that the District Court had exceeded its authority in granting relief on issues relating to parts of death row beyond where plaintiffs were housed.  </p><p>On remand, Judge Davis issued an order on February 4, 2005 granting attorneys' fees to plaintiffs.</p><p>On June 14, 2006, the District Court issued an order formally closing the case, noting that the issues in the case had been resolved.  The parties were advised that they could petition to reopen the case in the event that further remedial measures became necessary.  No such motions had been filed as of the date of this summary.</p><p></p>",

McDuff, Jackson, MS, Margaret Winter, Amer. Civ. \nLiberties Union, Washington, DC, for plaintiffs. \nMarvin L. White, Jr., Mississippi Atty. General's Office, Jackson, MS, for defendants. \nOPINION DENYING MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION TO STOP EXECUTION \nDAVIDSON, Chief Judge. \nPresently before the court is the Plaintiffs' motion for temporary restraining order 806*806 \nand for preliminary injunction to postpone the State of Mississippi's planned execution of the \nPlaintiff Tracy Hansen on July 17, 2002. Upon due consideration, the court finds that the \nmotion should be denied, and the Plaintiff Hansen's claims should be dismissed. \nA. Factual and Procedural Background \nThe Plaintiff Tracy Hansen was indicted for the crime of capital murder of a law enforcement \nofficer in 1987 by a Harrison County, Mississippi, grand jury for his role in the murder of \nMississippi Highway Patrolman Bruce Ladner. Due to pretrial publicity, Hansen won a \nchange of venue to Hinds County, where the case was tried. A jury found Hansen guilty of \ncapital murder and he was sentenced to death on October 30, 1987. The Mississippi \nSupreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence on December 18, 1991. Hansen v. \nState, 592 So.2d 114 (Miss.1991). The United States Supreme Court denied Hansen's \npetition for writ of certiorari on May 18, 1992, and denied his petition for rehearing on June \n29, 1992. Hansen v. Mississippi, 504 U.S. 921, 112 S.Ct. 1970, 118 L.Ed.2d 570, reh. \ndenied, 505 U.S. 1231, 112 S.Ct. 3060, 120 L.Ed.2d 924 (1992). \n\nHansen then filed an application for post-conviction relief with the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt. The Court denied his application on October 13, 1994, and denied his petition for \nrehearing on March 9, 1995. Hansen v. State, 649 So.2d 1256 (Miss.1994).[1] Thereafter, on \nNovember 28, 1995, the United States Supreme Court denied Hansen's petition for writ of \ncertiorari; his petition for rehearing was denied on January 16, 1996. Hansen v. Mississippi, \n516 U.S. 986, 116 S.Ct. 513, 133 L.Ed.2d 422 (1995), reh. denied, 516 U.S. 1085, 116 \nS.Ct. 801, 133 L.Ed.2d 748 (1996). \nHansen then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court \nfor the Southern District of Mississippi. The District Court denied Hansen's petition in an \nunpublished memorandum opinion and order on August 5, 1999. Hansen v. Puckett, No. \n1:96CV60-B-R. The United States District Court then denied Hansen's application for a \nCertificate of Appealability on October 13, 2000. Thereafter, Hansen applied to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for a Certificate of Appealability. The Fifth \nCircuit denied Hansen's request on November 6, 2001; his subsequent petition for \nrehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc was denied on December 5, 2001. Hansen \nv. Armstrong, 277 F.3d 1372 (5th Cir.2001). Hansen then filed a petition for writ of certiorari \nwith the United States Supreme Court. The Court denied his petition on June 17, 2002. \nHansen v. Sparkman, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2605, 153 L.Ed.2d 791 (2002). Following \nthat order, the Mississippi Supreme Court entered an order on June 24, 2002, setting \nHansen's execution for July 17, 2002. \nThereafter, on June 25, 2002, Hansen filed a second application for post-conviction relief \nwith the Mississippi Supreme Court seeking to have his death sentence set aside. The \nMississippi Supreme Court denied the application on July 3, 2002. Hansen then filed a \nmotion for rehearing with the Mississippi Supreme Court on July 10, 2002. That motion \nremains pending. \n807*807 On July 12, 2002, Hansen, along with five other Mississippi death row inmates, \nfiled the pending complaint in the case sub judice. In their complaint, the Plaintiffs assert \nclaims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of their rights under the First, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Along with their complaint, the \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, seeking to \ntemporarily postpone Hansen's July 17, 2002, execution. \nB. Discussion \nIn order to grant a request for injunctive relief, the court must apply the standard set forth by \nthe Fifth Circuit in Canal Authority of Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir.1974). \nPursuant to Canal Authority, the Plaintiffs in this matter have the burden of demonstrating \nfour specific criteria: \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; \n(2) a substantial threat that the movants will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is \ndenied; \n\n(3) that the threatened injury to the movants outweighs any damage that an injunction might \ncause the respondent; and \n(4) that granting the injunction will not disserve the public interest. \nRodriguez v. United States, 66 F.3d 95, 97 (5th Cir.1995). Preliminary injunctive relief is an \nextraordinary remedy, not normally available unless the movants clearly carry their burden \nof proof as to each of the four prerequisites. Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. United Gas \nPipe Line Co., 760 F.2d 618, 621 (5th Cir.1985). It is incumbent upon the movants to \ndemonstrate all four factors, and the failure to demonstrate any one of the four is sufficient \nfor the court to deny the issuance of an injunction. Allied Mktg. Group, Inc. v. CDL Mktg., \nInc., 878 F.2d 806, 809 (5th Cir.1989). Even if the movants successfully establish each of \nthe four Canal prongs, the decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction \nremains discretionary with the court. Mississippi Power & Light, 760 F.2d at 621. The \ndecision to grant a preliminary injunction is to be treated as the exception rather than the \nrule. Id. \n1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe present suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief for violation of numerous \nconstitutional and statutory rights arising out of the Plaintiffs' individual and collective \nconditions of confinement. The Plaintiffs' allegations include: (1) idleness and isolation; (2) \ndeprivation of basic sanitation and personal hygiene; (3) lack of adequate shelter from \nextreme heat, cold, rain, and vermin; (4) sleep deprivation; (5) denial of access to medical, \nmental health and dental care; (6) improper treatment of severely mentally ill inmates; and \n(7) denial of a functional administrative remedy program. In their motion for temporary \nrestraining order and preliminary injunction, the Plaintiffs argue that Hansen's impending \nexecution must be postponed because he is a material and irreplaceable witness in this \naction, and his execution will strip the remaining Plaintiffs of their right to present his \ntestimony in support of their claims. \nThe court finds that the Plaintiffs' motion should be denied because the Plaintiffs cannot \ndemonstrate the requisite likelihood of success on the merits of the Plaintiff Tracy Hansen's \nclaims. See Walgreen Co. v. Hood, 275 F.3d 475, 477 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that \npreliminary injunction may be denied based solely on movant's failure to demonstrate \nlikelihood of success on the merits of his claims; other 808*808 Canal Authority factors \nneed not be addressed in such a case). \nIn order to find that Hansen has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits of his claims, the Plaintiffs must first demonstrate that Hansen has a right of action \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Fifth Circuit, however, recently foreclosed such relief. In \nMartinez v. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, 292 F.3d 417 (5th Cir.2002), cert. denied, \n___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1046 (2002), a group of Texas death row \ninmates filed a Section 1983 lawsuit alleging that their rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution had been violated. The Plaintiffs \nin that case sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing the \nState of Texas from executing them during the pendency of their Section 1983 litigation. \nMartinez, 292 F.3d at 419-20. The Fifth Circuit held that the Plaintiffs' Section 1983 claims \n\nwere properly construed by the district court as requests for writs of habeas corpus under \n28 U.S.C. § 2254. Id. at 423. The Fifth Circuit went on to hold that the district court's \ndismissal of the Plaintiffs' complaint was proper because, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254, \nfederal district courts lack jurisdiction to consider second or successive habeas petitions \nunless the Fifth Circuit has granted the Plaintiffs express permission to file such a petition. \nId. \nHere, as in Martinez, the Plaintiffs' complaint should be construed as a petition for writ of \nhabeas corpus, at least insofar as Tracy Hansen's claims are concerned. The Plaintiffs seek \na temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction temporarily postponing Hansen's \nexecution until he gives testimony in the present Section 1983 case; in Martinez, the \nPlaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing the \nState of Texas from executing any of the Plaintiffs until their Section 1983 litigation had run \nits course. See Martinez, 292 F.3d at 419-20. Such requests are the functional equivalent of \na request for a stay of execution. Id. at 423. \nIt is axiomatic that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a \nprisoner seeking a stay of execution; federal courts lack jurisdiction to stay executions \nunder Section 1983. Martinez, 292 F.3d at 423; Moody v. Rodriguez, 164 F.3d 893 (5th \nCir.1999). Construing the Plaintiffs' request to stay Hansen's execution as a habeas claim, \nas it must in accordance with Martinez, the court finds that it is without jurisdiction to \nconsider Hansen's claims because Hansen has already sought, and been denied, habeas \nrelief through the federal courts; and the Fifth Circuit has not authorized Hansen to file a \nsecond or successive habeas petition. See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A); Hansen v. Puckett, \nNo. 1:96CV60-B-R; Hansen v. Armstrong, 277 F.3d 1372 (5th Cir.2001); Hansen v. \nSparkman, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2605, 153 L.Ed.2d 791 (2002). \nAccordingly, the court finds that the Plaintiffs have not shown a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of Tracy Hansen's claims, and their motion for temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction seeking to stop Hansen's execution is therefore denied. In \naddition, Hansen's claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are hereby dismissed. \n2. Equitable Considerations \nIn addition to the grounds set forth above for the denial of the Plaintiffs' motion and the \ndismissal of Hansen's claims, the court finds that numerous equitable considerations, \nincluding the State of Mississippi's strong interest in proceeding with Hansen's execution, \nweigh against this court exercising its discretion in favor 809*809 of temporarily postponing \nthe execution. See, e.g., Gomez v. United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia, 503 U.S. 653, 654, 112 S.Ct. 1652, 118 L.Ed.2d 293 (1992). Further, the court \nfinds that the Plaintiffs' argument that Hansen is a crucial witness in this case is without \nmerit. Over sixty prisoners are presently incarcerated on death row in Mississippi, and the \nPlaintiffs have not established that Hansen's testimony cannot be replaced by other \ninmates' testimony. In fact, the Plaintiffs state in their complaint that \"[t]he claims of the \nnamed plaintiffs [including Tracy Hansen] are typical of those of the class.\" See Complaint \nat 19. \n\nIn any event, as has been previously noted, it is well established that \"federal courts lack \njurisdiction to stay executions under Section 1983.\" Moody, 164 F.3d at 893. Accordingly, \nthe Plaintiffs' motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to \nstop the execution of Tracy Hansen shall be denied, and Hansen's claims under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 shall be dismissed. \nA separate order in accordance in this opinion shall issue this day. \nORDER DENYING MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION TO STOP EXECUTION \nPursuant to an opinion issued this day, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n(1) the Plaintiffs' motion for temporary restraining order and for preliminary injunction \n(docket entries 2-1 and 2-2) is DENIED; and \n(2) the Plaintiff Tracy Hansen's claims are DISMISSED. \nAll memoranda, depositions, declarations, and other materials considered by the court in \nruling on this motion are hereby incorporated into and made a part of the record in this \naction. \n[1] The Mississippi Supreme Court remanded the case to the Circuit Court of Harrison County for modification of \nsentence to reflect that Hansen would be executed by lethal injection rather than lethal gas. Hansen, 649 So.2d at \n1258. The Circuit Court of Harrison County modified Hansen's sentence in accordance with the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt's opinion and mandate on May 23, 1995. \n ",

      "text": " \n \n \n \nREPORT OF DR. TERRY A. KUPERS, M.D., M.S.P. \n \n1.  I am a board-certified psychiatrist, and have been retained as an expert \nwitness by plaintiffs’ counsel in this case.  My qualifications and curriculum \nvitae have previously been provided to the Court. This Report supplements \nmy July 7, 2002 Declaration.  \n  \n2.  I toured Death Row at Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman, on \nAugust 8, 2002, in the company of ACLU and MDOC attorneys, the Warden \nand Associate Warden of Unit 32, and Corrections staff.  I also visited the \nUnit 32 clinic and other areas in Unit 32 and the Prison Hospital in Unit 42. \n I interviewed Corrections staff, Chief Medical Officer Dr. John Bearry, \nPsych. Assistant Mildred Ware, and another Psych. Assistant (the \nPsychiatrist, Dr. Glenn, was not at the facility that day). I interviewed 21 \nDeath Row prisoners in the visiting room, by phone through a glass \npartition. I interviewed an additional ten prisoners at their cells. I reviewed \nover twenty medical and mental health charts. The tour, interviews and chart \nreview began at 8 A.M. and lasted until 10:30 P.M. Before and after the tour, \nI reviewed additional written letters and affidavits from prisoners, statistics \nregarding appeals and post-conviction legal outcomes, temperature data, and \nvarious Mississippi Department of Corrections policies pertaining to Death \nRow, including The Standard Operating Procedures Manual of The \nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of Mississippi Medical Center Div. of \nCorrectional Medicine (eff. 10/1/00) and related policies. \n \n3.  It was abundantly obvious that MDOC had made efforts to improve \nappearances in the days immediately preceding our tour.   A few days before \nour tour, all of the state prisoners who had been housed among Death Row \nprisoners had been relocated.  In the three days preceding our tour, the \npsychiatry department had posted quite a few \"90 day Comprehensive \nMental Health reviews\" in the inmates’ medical charts.   Shortly before our \ntour, some of the prisoners’ televisions and fans had been returned to them. \n The outdoor areas surrounding C Building had been sprayed for insects \nwithin hours of our visit.  Parts of Tier 1 had been freshly painted.  Staff had \ngiven showers to psychotic prisoners and had cleaned their cells shortly \nbefore we arrived.     \n  1\n\n  \n4.  Nevertheless, my observations, interviews with staff and inmates, and \ndocument review during my fourteen-hour tour confirmed the accuracy of \nthe descriptions provided in the prisoner declarations on which I relied in my \nJuly 7, 2002 Declaration.  Parchman¹s Death Row rivals any prison I have \nseen for cruel, harsh and inhumane conditions of confinement, even \ncompared with super-maximum facilities. These conditions are not \nwarranted on penological grounds, and they cause the Death Row prisoners \nat Parchman intense and needless pain and suffering.  These conditions are \nvirtually certain to cause medical illness and destruction of mental stability \nand functioning. It is probable that as a result of these conditions, a \nsignificant proportion of the prisoners have developed or will develop \npsychiatric conditions that interfere with their ability to cope with life in \nprison and in the community, and that many have suffered or will suffer \nbreakdowns that become chronic and chronically disabling.   \n  \n5.  It should be noted that in fact many of these prisoners will never be \nexecuted:  a significant number of them will eventually have their sentences \nvacated by the courts and be released from Death Row; some may \neventually be exonerated.  Of 183 death sentences imposed in Mississippi \nsince 1976, 5 people have been executed, four have had their convictions \nreversed, and five have been resentenced to life imprisonment. The \nMississippi Supreme Court has reversed the death penalty in 41% of the 166 \ndirect appeals it has ruled upon; relief was granted in federal habeas or \nfollowing federal habeas court remand in 21 cases; and sixty-seven \nsentences (36.6%) are still under review.  Thus, almost as many people have \nhad their convictions reversed as have been executed, and relief in some \nform was granted in 108 cases (59%).  But in any event, in our society, even \na prisoner condemned to execution may not be incarcerated in cruelly \ninhumane conditions, or allowed to suffer severe pain and illness without \nbasic treatment for his serious medical and psychiatric needs. \n  \n6.  A high percentage of the prisoners I interviewed clearly suffer from \nsevere mental illness. At least six suffer from obvious psychosis with current \nsigns including auditory hallucinations and delusions. At least another six \nsuffer from severe depression and other mood disorders.  I also discovered \nseveral cases each of severe anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and other significant mental illnesses.  In all likelihood there are \nmany more prisoners suffering from serious mental illness beyond the ones I \nhappened to interview.  \n  2\n\n \n7. The very serious mental health needs of these prisoners are not being \naddressed. The mental health care available to prisoners on Death Row is \ngrossly inadequate. There are three Psych. Assistant positions, but only two \nare filled.  There is a Psych. Evaluator; and a part-time Psychiatrist whose \ncaseloads include Death Row prisoners as well as prisoners on other units. \nBesides brief visits with the psychiatrist, which are supposed to occur once \nevery three months on average (in a few cases they occur more frequently \nbut in many more cases they actually occur much less frequently), there is \nlittle in the way of mental health services.  The Psych. Assistants told me \nthat they make rounds and ask prisoners known to suffer from significant \nmental illness how they are doing, but most of these interviews are very \nbrief. Further, many of these visits occur at the prisoner¹s cell door within \nearshot of other prisoners and Corrections Officers.  Thus, there is no \nconfidentiality, and prisoners are very unlikely to aver any emotional \nproblems in such a setting.   \n  \n8. The Psych. Assistants told me that, although their caseloads are very large \nand they are responsible for other populations besides Death Row, they still \nhave approximately 20 cases between them on Death Row. They state that \nthey conduct monthly interviews with these 20 prisoners in an office on the \ntier, which can last between 10 to 20 minutes each.  \n  \n9. The prisoners tell another story.  Most of the prisoners who suffer from \nmental illness, including those who are prescribed psychiatric medications, \ntell me that besides their occasional visits with the psychiatrist they have no \nother contact with mental health personnel. When I ask about their contact \nwith the Psych. Assistants, some tell me that a Psych. Assistant occasionally \naccompanies Dr. Glenn on his rounds.  Others who are taking prescribed \npsychiatric medications tell me they have never even seen a Psych. \nAssistant.  Others told me that just before our August 8 tour, a Psych. \nAssistant came by their cell and talked to them at the door of their cell for a \nminute or two in order to complete a 90 day Comprehensive Mental Health \nReport, but they had never seen a Psych. Assistant on their tier before that. \n Quite a few prisoners report that they very rarely get to see the psychiatrist, \nand often the appointments they were given are canceled. Several report that \nthey are supposed to see Dr. Glenn every three months so he can monitor \ntheir psychiatric medications, but they have not actually seen him for over \nsix months. According to one prisoner who remembers being seen by a \nPsych. Assistant on rounds, \"Let me put it this way, I was on my way to the \n  3\n\nshower when he came by, and our interview did not slow my progress \ntoward the shower.\"  \n  \n10. My review of the medical charts of over 20 prisoners reveals that the \nprisoners¹ reports are essentially accurate.  Mental health notes are very \nsporadic and incomplete. There are some 90 day Comprehensive Mental \nHealth Reports in the charts, but they are not completed in their entirety, and \noften provide very little real information about the prisoners’ psychiatric \nconditions and the prisoners’ responses to treatment. Many psychiatric \nprogress notes consist of the name and dosage of a medication being \nprescribed and the length of time until the next appointment, with no \ncomment about the prisoner’s condition, why the medication is being \ncontinued or changed, nor any other treatment that might be indicated. \n There are occasional longer notes, sometimes typed and other times \nhandwritten, which may provide a little more information, but certainly do \nnot constitute adequate ongoing clinical chart entries. By looking at the dates \nof visits with the psychiatrist and the Psych. Assistants, it becomes clear that \nthere are often significant delays between the time a prisoner requests mental \nhealth services and the time they are seen, and often there are very long \nperiods between visits. One prisoner (S.M.) tells me he refuses to take the \ntranquilizers the psychiatrist prescribed in February because he has not been \nable to see the psychiatrist since February, in spite of requesting an \nappointment several times. A review of the charts bears out the prisoners’ \nreports.  There are frequent notes by non-physicians stating: \"Due to the \nnumber of patients and time constraints, this patient is being rescheduled.\" \n Many psychiatric medications require close monitoring and blood tests to \nguard against the development of toxic side effects, for example liver \ndamage.  The haphazard nature of appointments with mental health staff and \nthe lack of adequate notes in the charts lead me to conclude that adequate \nmonitoring of this kind is not occurring on a regular basis.   \n  \n11. As Mr. Nathan points out in his report, security staff are assigned to \ntransport and pass out prescribed medications.  This practice is unacceptable \nin terms of the standard of medical care.  The fact that so many prisoners \ncomplain about irregularities and gross error in the delivery of their \nmedications reflects the inadequacy of procedures for distributing prescribed \npsychiatric and other medications on Death Row at Parchman.  Several \nprisoners who are taking psychiatric medications told me that on more than a \nfew occasions they were given the wrong medications, and others told me \nthat their medications are frequently discontinued for days or longer for \n  4\n\nreasons unknown to them.  \n  \n12. Besides infrequent and extremely brief meetings with mental health \nstaff, many of which occur at the cell door, and the prescription of \npsychiatric medications, there are no psychiatric services available to \nprisoners on Death Row. I spoke to Ms. Ware, another Psych. Assistant, and \nDr. Bearry about the mental health treatment program.  They confirmed \nthere were no other services available except in the event someone needed \nadmission to a psychiatric hospital.  As I questioned them about who has \nbeen admitted to a psychiatric hospital for acute psychosis or serious suicide \nrisk in recent years, it became apparent that prison health care providers do \nnot utilize this option for prisoners on Death Row except on the rarest of \noccasions.  \n  \n13. Ms. Ware and Dr. Bearry told me that the Observation Cells in the \nPrison Hospital in Unit 42 at Parchman have not been used to confine a \nDeath Row prisoner for years.  When I asked why, Dr. Bearry told me: \n\"There¹s been no reported suicide ideation or attempt on Death Row for \nyears.\" I found this statement to be incredible, given that a significant \nproportion of prisoners I interviewed spoke openly about their despair and \nfrequent thoughts of suicide. For example, Willie Russell confided that in \nJanuary 2002, he wrote a letter to the Unit Administrator saying he was \nplanning to kill himself, and the staff searched his cell and discovered \nhoarded pills that he was planning to use for that purpose. In other words, \nprisoners with serious mental illness or suicidal ideation on Death Row are \nmainly left to suffer alone in their cells without the benefit of mental health \nservices beyond the prescription of medications, and the monitoring of those \nmedications is far from adequate.  \n  \n14. While the mental health care is inadequate in general, the care provided \nto extremely disturbed individuals is shockingly deficient, and creates a \nthreat to the well-being of all prisoners on Death Row. Just about every \nprisoner I interviewed discussed the presence on Death Row of severely \npsychotic prisoners who foul their cells, stop up their toilets, flood the tiers \nwith excrement, and keep other prisoners awake all night with their \nincessant screams and shouts. Some of the severely disturbed prisoners at \nthe time the prisoners¹ affidavits were written were \"state prisoners\" who are \nnot sentenced to death but were confined on the tiers that house Death Row. \nThese \"state prisoners\" were removed from the three tiers we toured just \nprior to our visit. There remain at least three Death Row prisoners (Ronnie \n  5\n\nC., James B. and David B.) who are obviously acutely psychotic in spite of \nbeing prescribed psychiatric medications, and who foul their cells and the \ntiers and/or scream and make noise day and night. Several prisoners \ninformed me there are others who are nearly as disturbed, loud and filthy as \nthose three.  \n  \n15. I interviewed David B.  He is acutely psychotic and admits to screaming \nloudly and disturbing the other prisoners day and night, and he tells me he \ncannot control himself even when he takes anti-psychotic medications. I \npassed by the cell of James B., who is also clearly psychotic.  Even though \nofficers had forcibly showered him and cleaned his cell just prior to our tour, \nhis cell already emanated a foul odor by the time I passed by on the evening \nof August 8.  \n  \n16. Prisoners who are as severely disturbed and disruptive as James B., \nDavid B. and Ronnie C. require much more intensive psychiatric treatment \nthan is available on Death Row at Parchman. The problem with their not \nbeing adequately cared for and treated is twofold.  First, the seriously \ndisturbed prisoners are left to deteriorate even further because of the severe \nidleness and isolation on Death Row and because of all the other conditions I \noutlined in my July 7 Declaration, and as a result their psychiatric \ndisturbances become more severe, chronic and unresponsive to future \ntreatment, and therefore their prognoses becomes much worse.  Second, \nprisoners in neighboring cells suffer immense pain, discomfort and \npsychiatric breakdown because of the presence among them of prisoners \nwho cannot control themselves and foul the cell-block, flood the tiers, throw \nexcrement and keep the others up day and night with their loud noises and \nhollering.  \n  \n17. One prisoner (H.G.), who has been diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenic \nand is prescribed Haldol, a strong anti-psychotic medication, hears voices \nthat order him \"to do things\" (command hallucinations). He tells me that he \nsleeps much of every day, he cannot afford a television so when he is awake \nhe sits and stares or tries to read, but he cannot remember what he reads and \ncannot concentrate on the pages. His cell was next door to that of Ronnie C. \nfor some time, and the noise, \"the stink from Ronnie¹s cell,\" and the many \nbugs that fly from the filth in Ronnie¹s cell, made him extremely anxious \nand made the voices in his head louder.  These are entirely unacceptable \nconditions of confinement and psychiatric treatment for a prisoner who \nsuffers from this degree of serious mental illness.  There are many more \n  6\n\nprisoners on Death Row who suffer from serious mental illness and are \nreceiving far from adequate mental health treatment.   \n  \n18. Corrections staff tell me that their strategy for managing Death Row \nprisoners whom they consider to be high security risks is to constantly move \nthem to a new cell, on average once every week. Of course, this means that \nother prisoners must be moved to accommodate the movement of the high-\nrisk prisoners; thus, there is frequent and widespread cell movement. \n Security Expert Vincent Nathan questions the necessity of this procedure in \nhis Report.  The consequence, whether intended or unintended, is that \nprisoners live with the omnipresent possibility that they will be placed in a \nfilthy, foul-smelling cell that had been occupied by one of the very disturbed \nprisoners who smeared feces or fouled the cell, or a cell in which the \nwindow mechanism is broken or the electrical outlet has been destroyed. \nWhen the unlucky prisoner who is moved into a filthy cell requests cleaning \nsupplies to make the cell habitable, the staff cannot or will not provide \nadequate supplies. \n  \n19.  This technique for managing security risks constitutes a kind of physical \nand psychological punishment that can drive men stark raving mad, or to \nsuicide. A July 29, 2002 letter from Paul Woodward describes the effect on \nhim of a recent move of this kind: \"They moved me into Cell #13, which had \nbeen Ronnie C¹s cell. Cell #13 has no electrical outlet or TV hook-up. I \ncouldn¹t use any of my electrical appliances. My fan was sorely missed! The \ncell was full of mosquitoes, as the window was open and the screen has a \nhuge gash in it. There was feces and dried urine all over the floor and walls, \nas well as the bars and the bed. I asked officers for a broom and mop for 5 \nhours, but all they gave me was a piece of a towel and a little disinfectant, \nwhich I used on the bars as my food had to pass through them. The heat and \nmosquitoes were too bad to sleep, so I spent most of that night (the 24th) \nscrubbing that cell. You may recall that I weigh 320 lbs. The only way I \ncould scrub the floor with that piece of towel was to get down on my hands \nand knees. I tried to lie on the bed and clean a spot on the floor to begin on \nmy hands and knees. I wanted to keep from getting the feces and urine all \nover me, but I failed miserably! When I had the cell as clean as I could get it, \nI washed myself, and then my boxers. A sergeant came along and told me to \ntake the clothesline down or get written up. It just seemed that everything \nwas working on me as punishment.\"  \n  \n20. Health care for Death Row prisoners is as glaringly deficient as mental \n  7\n\nhealth care. There are long waits to see the physician, emergencies are not \nmanaged adequately, prisoners complain that there are interruptions in the \ndaily provision of medications, prisoners on Death Row are not offered \nmedical and surgical treatments that are indicated for their conditions and \nare available to prisoners in other units, and so forth. Regarding heat-related \nillness, Dr. Susi Vassallo states in her 8/31/02 Expert¹s Report: \"All of the \ninmates on Death Row are at high risk of heat stroke and heat-related illness. \nIn the extremely hot environment I experienced in Unit 32, and as confirmed \nby the temperature and humidity measurements taken by environmental \nexpert James Balsamo, even individuals without any underlying medical \nconditions would be expected to suffer heat-related illness. However, many \nof the prisoners are at particularly heightened risk of serious heat-related \nillness and permanent injury.\" \n  \n21. Inadequate health care has destructive psychological consequences. \nMany prisoners expressed great anxiety about getting sick and not receiving \nadequate treatment. Several prisoners told me that they have witnessed other \nprisoners become acutely ill only to be left in their cells without medical \nattention for many hours, and they are anxious that they would receive the \nsame inattention were they to become deathly ill. Two prisoners confided \nthat they plan to give up their capital appeals because they are terrified that \nthey will eventually get sick, receive inadequate health care and become \nterribly disabled.  Both prisoners confided that they would rather be dead, \nand this is why they plan to waive their legal appeals.    \n \n22.    Besides the gross deficiencies in medical and mental health care, I \nobserved first-hand a number of the other inhumane conditions of which the \nprisoners complain, including the \"ping pong toilets.\" When a prisoner \nflushes his toilet, the waste backs up into his neighbor¹s toilet.  Many of the \nprisoners cover their toilet bowl with a towel in order to slow the overflow \nof waste from their neighbor, but this is likely to leave them without a clean \ntowel. Worse, if a prisoner suffering from serious mental illness stuffs \nsomething down his toilet in order to stop it up, the toilets up and down the \ntier back up and waste overflows onto the floor in all the cells. \n Environmental Expert James Balsamo summarizes his findings: \n \"Conditions in this facility, including excessive heat, filth, uncontrolled \ninsect and mosquito infestations with attendant risk of West Nile infection, \ninadequate water supply, water leaks, impaired ventilation, uncontrolled \nwater temperatures, malfunctioning toilets, the apparent lack of adequate \ncleaning supplies, food being held and served at unsafe temperatures, \n  8\n\nunsanitary laundry, broken automatic fire detection and alarm system, \nexcessive noise, and extremely poor lighting, all combine to seriously \njeopardize the health and safety of the inmates and the correctional officers \nwho live and work in Unit C-32, Death Row.\"  \n \n 23. The high risk of morbidity and mortality on Parchman¹s Death Row due \nto extremes of heat and humidity requires urgent attention. It was 90 degrees \nin some of the cells as measured by Mr. James Balsamo in the evening of the \nday we toured, and August 8 was a relatively cool day for the Mississippi \nDelta.  The temperature and humidity are often significantly higher during \nthis summer and other summers. Thus, the reported outdoor high on August \n8, 2002, was 91 degrees F; while the high on 7/31 was 93, on 8/1 it was 93, \non 8/2 it was 94, on 8/3 it was 97, on 8/4 it was 98, on 8/5 it was 95, on 8/6 \nit was 96, and on 8/7, the day prior to our tour, it was 97.  Any time the \nambient temperature exceeds 88 degrees Fahrenheit there is significant \ndanger of heat-related morbidity and mortality (see Dr. Susi Vasallo¹s \nReport).  This is especially the case for prisoners suffering from serious \nmental illness and taking psychiatric medications or any other \nanticholinergic or otherwise implicated medications (see my July 7 \nDeclaration).  \n  \n24. I had myself locked for a few minutes into Willie Rusell¹s \"special \nmanagement\" cell, which has a Plexiglas cover over the metal door, and \nexperienced even more discomfort than I felt in the regular cells. Even being \nlocked in the cell for a few minutes I could feel the temperature and \nhumidity rise.  This kind of punishment is well known to cause intense \nanxiety and rage, psychiatric breakdown, and in a large proportion of cases, \nsuicide.  \n  \n25. A certain modicum of dignity and self-respect is a requirement for the \nmaintenance of sound mental health.  Most of the prisoners I spoke to were \nvery upset by what they consider arbitrary rules that inflict unnecessary pain \nand deprivations.  For example, policy prohibits prisoners from moving their \nmattresses from the concrete slabs under the window, there are several \nreasons why prisoners urgently want to move from under their windows. \n When state prisoners in cells above flood their toilets, or when rainwater \npours in along the outer cell wall onto the bed, yet the prisoner is not \nallowed to move his bed away from the water. In many cells, the afternoon \nsun shines through the windows directly onto the prisoners¹ bunks, yet \npolicy prohibits the prisoners from covering their window to avoid the sun¹s \n  9\n\nglare. Several inmates spoke of their attempts to lie on the floor in order to \ngain relief from the excruciating heat, only to be told by officers that they \nwill be given a disciplinary write-up if they lie on the floor. While prisoners \nare required to keep their cells clean, the officers do not bring them \nsufficient cleaning materials. A prisoner explains: \"They bring a bucket of \nwater and a mop to the first cell on the tier, and then when that guy¹s \nfinished cleaning his cell they take it to the next cell. By the time the bucket \ngets to the third cell the water is filthy, and they never even bother taking it \npast the first few cells on the tier. So the guys in the further back cells never \nget a chance to clean their cells.\"  MDOC recently instituted a policy that the \nmen on Death Row must wear other inmates¹ used underwear.  Many of the \nprisoners I interviewed felt that being forced to wear another man¹s used \nunderclothes, which they have no way of sanitizing, was so repugnant, \nhumiliating and demeaning, that they would rather incur discipline than obey \norders to do so.  \n \n26.  Most of the prisoners feel that the rules are enforced in erratic and \nunpredictable ways. I asked some prisoners why they did not purchase a \ntelevision or radio when they are permitted to do so, and was told by several \nprisoners that a television costs over $300, and they can never know when it \nwill be taken away from them for purely arbitrary reasons. The attitude of \nmany prisoners was summed up by one man: \"What¹s the use? Why \npurchase a television when it can be taken from you in a minute and you \nmay or may not get it back?\"  Mr. Nathan discusses flaws in the disciplinary \nsystem in his report.  \n  \n27. The prisoners corroborated all concerns I culled from the Affidavits for \nmy July 7 Declaration regarding telephone calls, visits and mail. (¶ 53 - 58). \nMany prisoners told me they do not have visits for a variety of reasons, \nincluding the limiting of visits for Death Row prisoners to weekdays when \ntheir loved ones work.  Phone calls are expensive and their mail can be \nhalted on account of a disciplinary infraction, or if they lack the money to \npurchase stamps at the commissary they cannot write letters. In these and \nother ways, their contacts with loved ones outside of Death Row are blocked \nor restricted, and as a result they feel very isolated and are prone to all the \npsychiatric hazards of isolation I described in my July 7 Declaration. \n  \n28. The perception among prisoners is of incessant, unrelenting and arbitrary \ndeprivations and punishments. According to Steve Knox: \"Every rule change \nis for the worse they took our shoes and we have to go out on the yard in the \n  10\n\nrain and get our feet wet, and we can¹t even run and get any exercise in those \nshower clogs; then in April (2002) they took most of our photographs and \nlimited us to keeping only ten letters from loved ones in our cells, I don¹t \nknow why, but it was hurtful, those letters are all I have from my sister and \nothers I love; then they stopped stamps from coming in through the mail \n you have to buy them in commissary - I don¹t have money, I was broke for \ntwo months and that meant I couldn¹t write to anyone.\" According to another \nprisoner, \"It seems like everything they do around here is aimed at driving \nyou crazy.\"  \n  \n29. A certain amount of sadness is obviously to be expected in a Death Row \nsetting, but at Parchman I discovered rampant depression, hopelessness and \nsuicidal ideation, far beyond what I have observed on Death Rows in other \nstates.  The prisoners connect their sense of despair and lack of hope to the \nharsh conditions and incremental deprivations they feel are unfairly forced \nupon them. The prisoners¹ gloomy characterization of the incremental \ndeprivations is born out by my observations. Things are taken away, things \nare never given. There are no programs and few if any opportunities for the \nprisoners to improve their situation by behaving well.  Hope fades of ever \nbeing treated like a human being again. Despair sets in.   \n  \n30. I saw much evidence of psychiatric breakdown. I mentioned in my July \n7 Declaration that under the extreme conditions of isolated confinement, \npsychiatric symptoms begin to emerge in previously healthy prisoners, and \nin less healthy ones there is psychosis, mania or compulsive acts of self-\nabuse and suicide.  I also described some of the signs and symptoms of the \nSHU Syndrome (¶ 20 & 21). Besides the despair and depression and the \nmany cases of serious mental illness I have already described, my interviews \nwith prisoners on August 8 uncovered widespread inability to concentrate on \neven the simplest tasks, severe memory loss, depersonalization, paranoia and \nso forth - i.e. all the symptoms of The SHU Syndrome.  Many prisoners told \nme about the rage they feel, in spite of their every effort to remain peaceful. \nOne prisoner tells me he gets angry, then he gets into heated conversations \nwith other prisoners or officers, then he \"sasses a guard, then I get written up \nand lose privileges; a favorite for them to take is canteen, and that makes me \nangrier.  I know it¹s a losing battle and that it¹s the prison that makes me so \nangry - I try not to get angry, but I can¹t stop myself.\" Another prisoner \nconfides: \"I¹m always afraid something bad¹s going to happen to me.\" \n  \n31. It is very clear that while isolation and idleness alone would cause many \n  11\n\ntroubling psychiatric symptoms, the other harsh conditions in effect on \nParchman¹s Death Row - including but not limited to the extremes of heat \nand humidity, the grossly unsanitary environment, the vermin, the arbitrary \nand punitive disciplinary policies, and inadequate health and mental health \ncare - significantly increase the risk of prisoners developing major \npsychiatric problems and increase the severity of despair and psychiatric \nmorbidity that plague these prisoners.  The presence of severely disturbed \nprisoners on the tiers decidedly worsens the psychiatric symptoms of other \nprisoners.  It is likewise highly anxiety-producing for prisoners to watch as a \nneighbor suffers seemingly life-threatening medical symptoms and yet is left \nentirely unattended by medical staff. The very anxious prisoner, who is \nprone to panic attacks with an accompanying sense that he cannot get \nenough air to breathe, cannot tolerate filthy conditions, extremes of heat and \nhumidity and a situation where he must keep his window shut no matter how \nhot it is if he is to keep the bugs out of his cell; in fact, these are precisely \nthe conditions that would lead him to experience objective problems \nbreathing along with a subjective sense of breathlessness and panic. \nPrisoners suffering from mental illness also suffer extreme anxiety when \nthey realize that nobody will respond to their calls for help because the \nintercom is nonfunctional and staff are often not present on the tiers (see \nReport of Security Expert Vincent Nathan).  This anxiety will inevitably \ncause a certain number of prisoners suffering from anxiety to act \ninappropriately, for example by hollering or banging on their doors, to \nsummon staff.  According to the prisoners with whom I spoke, when staff \neventually do get around to responding, they pay more attention to the fact \nthat the prisoner is making noise than to the emergency needs that led the \nprisoner to try so hard to get the staff¹s attention.  Again, as in many other \ninstances, the staff¹s response is likely to be limited to punishment, a \ndisciplinary infraction perhaps, and meanwhile the prisoners¹ concerns about \nthe lack of emergency response go unheard.  \n \n32.  All the inhumane conditions I have described combine to make life \nunbearable on Death Row at Parchman.  For example, Jimmy Mack waived \nall further appeals while he was confined for a long time behind a plastic-\ncovered door in a special management cell.  He explained to me, \"If I¹m \ngoing to have to live like that, you might as well just kill me.\" Recently he \nwas removed from that cell and decided to permit his appeals to go forward. \nWillie Russell continues to be incarcerated in this kind of cell, where he has \nbeen for two years.  \n \n  12\n\n33. It is a matter of great urgency that Death Row prisoners suffering from \nsevere mental illness receive appropriate treatment.  There are at least three, \nand possibly more, prisoners on Death Row who are so severely mentally ill \nthat they are incapable of maintaining their personal hygiene, who smear \ntheir cells with excrement and garbage, and who shriek day and night.  It is \ncruel and unconscionable to leave these severely mentally ill prisoners \ncompletely without care in these conditions. It is equally cruel to the \nremaining prisoners to subject them to the extreme behaviors of the severely \nill inmates;  to do so causes mental breakdown in them, as well.  Prisoners \nwith serious mental illness must be moved to a secure treatment facility \nwhere they can receive competent and humane treatment, and where their \nbehavior will not cause severe mental illness and great pain and suffering in \nother prisoners housed next to them.     \n \n34.  In preparation for our August 8 tour, MDOC staff actually showered the \nthree most severely disturbed prisoners and cleaned their cells.  For the sake \nof basic decency, staff must clean these prisoners and their cells on a daily \nbasis as long as their psychiatric condition is so deteriorated that they cannot \nattend to their own hygiene, and not just when an inspection tour by an \noutside agency is about to occur.  Furthermore, it is well known that \nconfining prisoners who are severely disturbed in a cell 23 or 24 hours per \nday and leaving them idle and isolated will make their psychiatric condition \ndeteriorate even further.  They must be offered supervised and safe \ntherapeutic activities and social interaction aimed at improving their mental \nstatus or at least preventing further deterioration.  Mental health staff trained \nin intervening with very disturbed patients must spend significantly more \ntime with these prisoners than the few minutes at cell front the mental health \nstaff currently spend. A standard, minimally acceptable treatment regimen \nfor patients this seriously disturbed includes an intensive behavior \nmodification program and training in personal hygiene and cell sanitation, \nplus sufficient intervention by mental health staff to educate them about their \npsychiatric illness and the benefits of proper psychiatric medications and \nother treatments.  In addition, mental health staff need to train security staff \nabout severe mental illness and effective ways to intervene with severely \ndisturbed prisoners, and intensive treatment planning is needed, including \nongoing case conferences and meetings between mental health and security \nstaff regarding management and treatment of these prisoners.   \n \n35. There is a larger number of prisoners on Death Row who are suffering \nfrom serious mental illness, yet are not so disturbed that they foul their cells \n  13\n\nand create constant noise and disruptions. These prisoners are receiving \npsychiatric medications while receiving almost no other treatment and being \nleft almost entirely idle and isolated in their cells. Continued isolated \nconfinement is very likely to cause further deterioration of their psychiatric \nconditions, and they require more intensive treatment than can be \nadministered in the Death Row setting.  A secure treatment facility must be \nestablished that provides necessary therapeutic programs in a setting that \nwill not increase psychiatric illness.   \n \n36.    The remaining Death Row prisoners , those who are currently in \nrelatively sound mental health, are all at serious risk for psychiatric \nbreakdown because of the conditions on Death Row.   These prisoners have \na right to be free of the unsanitary conditions, the vermin, the unbearable and \nunhealthy heat and humidity, the malfunctioning plumbing and sewage \nsystem, the arbitrary and ineffective disciplinary policies and practices, the \ninadequate health and mental health care and all the other inhumane \nconditions outlined in my report and that of the other experts.  How would \nthe average citizen in the community react, knowing that the water can shut \noff and not be restored for a week at any time during a heat wave? That they \nare helpless to take basic precautionary measures against West Nile virus? \nThat there is nothing they can do to prevent their toilet from overflowing at \nany time with waste from neighbors’ cells?  That in case of fire or a heart \nattack there would be inadequate and slow emergency response?  Any of \nthese things, and certainly all of them in combination, would predictably \ncause anxiety, panic attacks, increased despair or intensified delusions, \ndepending on the individual's vulnerabilities.   \n \n37.  There needs to be an adequate suicide prevention and treatment program \nfor the Death Row inmates, so that those in despair and contemplating \nsuicide can talk to a sympathetic mental health staff member in a safe and \ntherapeutic setting.  The prisoners tell me either that they feel that the staff is \nnot interested in having any real therapeutic contact, or that they are \nunwilling to discuss their suicidal inclinations at their cell door within \nearshot of other prisoners and prison staff; or that they are afraid to admit \nhow seriously they are contemplating suicide because they would only be \nstripped and thrown into an observation cell on Unit 42 where they would be \neven more isolated than on Death Row.  Dr. Bearry’s incredible statement to \nme that there has not been any reported suicidal ideation on Death Row in \nyears shows the need for a less noxious suicide prevention facility, and much \nbetter access to sympathetic mental health staff in a confidential office \n  14\n\nsetting.    \n \n38.  Even well behaved prisoners on Death Row at Parchman are forced to \nendure permanent and almost total isolation and idleness.  There is no reason \nfor all Death Row prisoners to be kept in their cells 23 or 24 hours per day. \n Of course there are prisoners who require special security precautions, and \nthere are prisoners who are legitimately punished for disciplinary \ninfractions.  But many of the prisoners on Death Row have maintained good \ndisciplinary records and are not viewed by staff as especially dangerous. \nMore out-of-cell activities should be offered to these prisoners: a better \nathletic area and the use of athletic shoes during exercise to allow for aerobic \nexercise; permission to exercise with one or two other prisoners; dayroom \nactivities such as games around a table or group television time, contact \nvisits with family; all are possibilities.  The existence of programs of this \nkind motivates good behavior.  If a prisoner proves he is too great a security \nrisk to take part in these activities, the consequence can be temporary loss of \nthese activities until the prisoner proves he can handle the greater freedom or \nsocial interaction.   \n \n39.  Death Row prisoners need a modicum of hope that through good \nbehavior they can positively affect their situation.  Human beings are most \nlikely to respond positively to punishments that are specific to their offenses \nand time-limited, so they can feel some hope that with better behavior they \ncan earn a better situation for themselves.  On Death Row at Parchman, the \npunishments are so severe and often so arbitrary, and the length of many of \nthe deprivations or punishments is so long or indeterminate, that the prisoner \ndespairs of ever alleviating his suffering.  The epitome of this unacceptable \nscenario is the continued confinement for the past two years of Willie \nRussell in a stripped down plastic-covered cell.   \n    \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nTerry A.

NO. l:02CV261-JAD\nROBERT L. JOHNSON, ET AL  DEPENDANTS\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nThis case was filed by plaintiffs complaining of a myriad of\nproblems at Unit 32-C, Mississippi State Penitentiary, which houses\nthe prisoners sentenced to death under Mississippi law. A non-jury\ntrial in this case was held before the undersigned United States\nMagistrate Judge with consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§636 (c)on February  13-15, 2003, in Oxford, Mississippi.  Having\nconsidered the evidence submitted at that trial and the arguments\nof counsel, the court is now prepared to issue its findings of fact\nand conclusions of law.  In those areas where a finding of fact is\nmade, the court has determined that the evidence presented by the\nparty supporting that finding is more persuasive.\nI.  Background\nThis suit was filed in July 2002 alleging that inmates housed\non Parchman's Death Row were knowingly and deliberately subjected\nby  the  defendants  to  profound  isolation,  lack  of  exercise,\nintolerable stench and filth, malfunctioning plumbing, constant\nexposure to human excrement, dangerously  high temperatures and\nhumidity,  uncontrolled  mosquitoes  and  insect  infestations,\ndeprivation of basic mental health care, and constant exposure to\nRussell v. Johnson\nPC-MS-003-001\n\nMAY-21-03 WED 12:04 PM  JUDGE DAVIS .  FAX NO.  6623691039  P.\n 4\nseverely psychotic inmates in adjoining cells.  Plaintiffs also\ncontended that the exposure to these conditions caused death row\ninmates intense physical and emotional pain and suffering which was\nlikely  to  cause  serious mental  illness  in previously  healthy\nprisoners  and  mental  breakdown  or  psychosis  in  less  healthy\nprisoners, placing the plaintiffs at high risk of premature death\nwhile they appealed their sentences.\nThe defendants have asserted that the complaint in this case\nshould be dismissed for failure of the plaintiffs to comply with\nthe administrative remedy program implemented by the Mississippi\nDepartment of Corrections  (MDOC) and approved by this court in\nGates, et al v. Collier, et al. Civil Action No. 4:71CV6-JAD, the\nongoing Mississippi prisoner class action lawsuit.  The defendants\nhave also asserted that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate\nan entitlement to class action status.\nThis case was originally assigned  to Chief Judge Glen H.\nDavidson who referred this matter for inclusion in the ongoing\nprison case in this district, Gates v. Collier.  The Gates case was\nassigned to the undersigned pursuant to the consent of the parties\nwhen former Chief Judge L. T. Senter   Jr., took senior status.\nt\nAfter the inclusion of this case in Gates, the parties consented to\ntrial before the undersigned.  The undersigned certified a sub-\nclass in Gates of the death row inmates housed in Unit 32-C at\nParchman.  The court finds that this case is properly certified as\n-2-\n\nMAY-21-03 WED 12:05 PM  JUDGE DAVIS .  FAX NO.  6623691039\nP. 5\na sub-class in Gates since the conditions of confinement on Death\nRow are unique to the inmates housed there.  However, findings by\nthis court on the conditions at Unit 32-C could impact the entire\nprison population.  The court finds that the class in this case is\nproperly certified pursuant to Rule 23 (b)(2), since it is clear\nthat any appropriate final injunctive or declaratory relief should\nbe with respect to the class as a whole, as the allegations against\nthe defendants are applicable to all inmates on Death Row, and, to\nsome  extent,  all  inmates  at  Unit  32  and  Parchman  generally.\nInclusion of this sub-class in the general class action case is\nappropriate and promotes judicial economy and consistent results.\nThe court further finds that the requirement of exhaustion in\nlitigation that has been ongoing since 1971 is a matter of form\nover substance.  The administrative remedy program cannot afford\nthe plaintiffs the relief necessary to remedy the complaints since\nany relief would necessarily impact previously entered orders of\nthis court.  Requiring exhaustion in this instance is futile since\nthe  case  was properly  included  in on-going  prison  conditions\nlitigation.\nII.  Findings of Fact\nDuring the course of this litigation, the Mississippi State\nPenitentiary obtained accreditation from the American Correctional\nAssociation (ACA) .  As this court has stated on numerous occasions,\nthe Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) is to be commended\n-3-\n\nMAY-zi-U'j WED l^ub  PM  JUDGE DAVIS .  FAX NO.  6623691039\nP. 6\nfor this important step in assuring that inmates are housed in a\nhumane manner. However, ACA accreditation does not moot the issues\nin this case and does not automatically insure that the conditions\nof confinement at Unit 32-C meet constitutional standards.\nA.  Sanitation\nTurning first to the general sanitation conditions, the court\nfinds that ACA accreditation has resulted in an upgrade of Unit 32-\nC by cleaning and painting.  Also, the accreditation resulted in\nthe formation of a general maintenance schedule.  It is clear from\nthe  evidence,  however,  that  prior  to  the  cleanup  for  ACA\naccreditation, inmates on Unit 32-C were subjected to cells that\n•were extremely filthy with chipped, peeling paint, dried fecal\nmatter and food encrusted on the walls, ceilings, and bars, as well\nas water from flooded toilets and rain leaks. The court also finds\nthat inmates are routinely moved from cell to cell and are forced\nto clean their new cells that may have been left in horrendous\nsanitation by the prior occupants, especially if the occupant were\nmentally  ill.  Furthermore,  adequate  cleaning  supplies  and\nequipment are not routinely made available for inmates to clean\ntheir cells. Several inmates testified they clean their cells with\ntheir shower soap, towels and tee shirts.  These filthy conditions\ncontribute to the infestation of pests and play a role in the\nmental well-being of inmates.\n-4-\n\nM  WED 12:06 PM  JUDGE DAVIS. .  6623691039  P. 7\n  PAI H0\nB.  Heatlno and Cooling\nThe next area of general concern is the heating and cooling of\nthe  cells.  The  summer  temperatures  in  the Mississippi  Delta\naverage in the nineties with high humidity, and Unit 32, for the\nmost part, is not an air-conditioned facility.  By state law, death\nrow inmates must be housed in a maximum security unit, and they are\nhoused together in Unit 32-C as a security measure.  There are\nindustrial type fans in the hallways to help with air circulation,\nand most inmates have smaller fans.  Relief from the heat can be\nobtained  by keeping  the windows open  in the cell using  fans.\nHowever, keeping the windows open increases the mosquito population\nin the cells since there are holes in the cell window screens and\nthe  screen  gauge  is  not  sufficient  to  keep  mosquitoes  out.\nGenerally,  the  ambient  temperature  in  the  cells  is  within\nreasonable limits except during the summer months. The court finds\nthat the ventilation in Unit 32-C is inadequate to afford prisoners\na  minimal  level  of  comfort  during  the  summer months.  While\ntemperatures  obviously  run high  during  the  summer  months  in\nMississippi, inmates on lockdown status, such as the inmates on\nDeath Row, must rely on the Mississippi Department of Corrections\nfor minimal relief.  The probability of heat-related illness is\nextreme at Unit 32-C, and is dramatically more so for mentally ill\ninmates who often do not take appropriate behavioral steps to deal\nwith the heat.  Also, the medications  commonly given to treat\n-5-\n\nMAY-21-03 WED 12:07 PM  JUDGE DAVIS .   NO.  6623691039\n  M P. 8\nvarious medical problems  interfere  with the body's ability to\nmaintain a normal temperature.  The inmates are not afforded extra\nshowers, ice water, or fans if they don't have fans when the heat\nindex is 90 or above.  The court  finds that the heat problem\nextends to all of Unit 32 and possibly throughout Parchman.\nC  Pest Control\nThe heat problem also exacerbates the problem of pest control.\nMosquitoes  in Mississippi and the Delta, in particular,  are a\nproblem that cannot be eliminated.  The court finds, however, that\nthe problem must be addressed and the impact lessened, especially\nwith the incidence of West Nile virus, a mosquito-born disease,\nincreasing  in  Mississippi.  The  court  finds  that  inadequate\nscreening on the cell windows causes the inmates to choose between\nsuffering  from the heat or increasing  the mosquitoes  in their\ncells.  The problems of heat and mosquitoes must be addressed to\nprovide the plaintiffs with conditions that would meet minimal\nconstitutional standards.  The problem of roaches and other vermin\nwill be met by adhering to the ACA standards and by meeting the\nsanitation goals the court will set.\nD.  \"Ping-Eon?\" Toilets and Plumbing\nThe  next  area  of  concern  is  the  plumbing  at  Unit  32,\nespecially the toilets.  The problem is described as \"ping-pong\ntoilets\" which means that fecal and other matter flushed by a\ntoilet in one cell will bubble up in the adjoining cell unless the\n-6-\n\nMAY-21-03 WED 12:0S PM  JUDGE DAVIS .  FAX HO.  6623691039  p. 9\ntoilets are flushed simultaneously.  This has been a problem in\nUnit 32 since the unit opened.  Parchman officials have identified\nthe problem as one of calibration, especially if the water is shut\noff.  The toilets must be recalibrated in order to work properly.\nThe court finds that recalibration appears to have helped, but does\nnot eliminate, the problem of ping-pong toilets.  No one in a\ncivilized society should be forced to live under conditions that\nforce exposure to another person's bodily wastes.  No matter how\nheinous the crime committed, there is no excuse for such living\nconditions.\nAs for the showers, water temperature, and quality of water,\nthe  court  finds  these  to  be  adequate.  The  Unit  32  water\ntemperature in the showers is within standards and individual cells\nhave lavatories.  The plaintiffs are afforded three showers a week\non Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The quality of water meets the\nappropriate health standards.\nE.  Smoke Detection/Fire Alarms and Food Service\nThe  court  also  finds  that  the  replacement  of  the  smoke\ndetection/fire alarm system in Unit 32-C is adequate and moots the\nconcerns of the plaintiffs. The court further finds that the meals\nprovided the inmates are brought from a main kitchen facility to a\nsatellite kitchen and then distributed to the various tiers. While\nthe temperature of some of the hot food items may occasionally have\n-7-\n\n•MAY-21-03WED12:08PM  JUDGE DA7IS . 0.  6623691039\n  F A U P. 10\ndropped below the optimal temperature of 140 degrees, there is no\nevidence to establish inadequate food handling or preparation.\nP.  Lighting\nAnother area of concern is the lighting at Unit 32. The court\nfinds that the lighting in the cells is grossly inadequate.  The\nmaximum  foot-candles1 obtained  by  the plaintiffs'  expert, Mr.\nBalsamo, was seven or eight foot-candles, with the typical cell\nbeing in the 2-4 foot-candle range.  The court finds that 20 foot-\ncandles is the appropriate level of lighting for these cells.  The\ndefendants  stated  they  changed  the  lighting  because  the  old\nlighting was used by inmates to hide contraband.  While this may be\na legitimate security concern, it does not mean that the MDOC can\ngo below minimum standards.\nG.  Preventive Maintenance Program\nThe preventive maintenance program instituted by the MDOC in\nresponse to ACA accreditation appears to be adequate, although the\ncourt finds that this program should be in writing.\nH.  Laundry\nDeputy  Commissioner  Sparkman  conceded  that  \"there  was  a\nproblem with some of the laundry\" causing the inmates laundry to be\nreturned foul-smelling and necessitating the inmates to wash their\n'A foot-candle is defined by Webster's New Collegiate\nDictionary as wa unit of illuminance on a surface that iB\neverywhere one foot from a uniform point source of light of one\ncandle and equal to one lumen per square foot.\"\n-8-\n\n•AI-21-03 «ED 12:09 FK  JUDGE DAVIS .  FAX KO.  6623691039  p.n\nclothes in their cells.  Mr. Sparkman testified that inmates wash\ntheir own clothes because of \"prison culture.\"  The court finds\nthat inmates are entitled to laundry that is clean and not foul-\nsmelling.  If they then choose to wash their own laundry, that is\na reasoned choice, not one brought on by necessity.\nI.  Mental Health Issues\nOne of the principal areas of concern for the court is the\narea of mental health issues for inmates housed on Death Row.  At.\nleast six severely psychotic prisoners are housed on Death Row and\nmany more are diagnosed with quantifiable mental health problems.\nThe extremely psychotic prisoners scream at night, throw feces, and\ngenerally make life miserable for the inmates and guards at Unit\n32-C.  As Dr. Kupers testified,  *it boils down to warehousing\npeople with severe mental illness. . .some are medicated, but there\nis essentially no other mental health services.\"  The court finds\nthat the mental health care afforded the inmates on Death Row is\ngrossly inadequate.  The isolation of Death Row, along with the\ninmates' pending sentences of death and the conditions at Unit 32-\nC, are enough to weaken even the strongest individual. What mental\nhealth services are provided generally take place at the inmate's\ncell within hearing of other inmates and guards.  This results in\nthe  failure  of  inmates  to tell  the mental health  specialists\nanything  of  substance.  Moreover,  comprehensive  mental  health\nevaluations  are  consistently  inadequate.  Inmates  are  also\n-9-\n\nMAY-21-03 WED 12:10 PM  JUDGE DAVIS .  FAX NO.  6623691039\nP. 12\nprescribed psychotropic drugs with only sporadic monitoring.  This\ncan result in life threatening situations due to the toxicity of\nthese drugs.  If the state is going to exact the ultimate penalty\nagainst these inmates, it must meet the mental health needs of each\nDeath  Row  inmate  and not merely  warehouse  them.  Appropriate\ntreatment of mentally ill inmates will in turn help address the\nissues  of  excessive  noise  and  sanitation  problems  caused  by\nseverely psychotic inmates.\nJ.  Exercise\nFinally, the court finds that proper exercise is advantageous\nfor mental and health well-being. The exercise facilities provided\nare adequate.  While the court understands the use of \"flip-flops\"\nas general footwear as a security measure, such shoes do not allow\neffective exercise.  The inmates should be given access to sneakers\nrather than wflip-flops\" prior to entering the exercise pen and\nshould be given access to water and shade while exercising.  To the\nextent other issues have been raised by the plaintiffs, the court\nfinds that there is inadequate proof to necessitate any remedial\naction.\nIII.  Conclusions of Law\nThe  plaintiffs  in  this  case  have  shown  that  they  were\nincarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of harm.\nFarmer  v.  Brennan.  511 U.S. 825, 839-840  (1994).  It  is not\nnecessary for an Eighth Amendment claimant to show that a prison\n-10-\n\nMAY-21-03 WED 12:11 PM  JUDGE DAVIS .  FAX NO.  6623691039  P. 13\nofficial acted or failed to act believing that an inmate would\nactually be harmed; it is enough that the official acted or failed\nto act despite knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm. Id.\nat 842.  The court finds that the conditions identified in the\ncourt's Findings of Fact are conditions that the prison officials\nknew posed  substantial risk since the risks are obvious.  Id.\nCorrectional officials' treatment of prisoners violates the Eighth\nAmendment whenever it woffend[s] contemporary concepts of decency,\nhuman dignity, and precepts of civilization which we profess to\npossess.\"  Hope v, Pelzer. 536 U.S. 730, 737, N.6  (2002), quoting\nGates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1306 {5th Cir. 1974).  Moreover,\nit is not necessary that damage has yet to occur if the unsafe\nconditions  \"pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage  to [a\nprisoner's] future health.  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33\n(1993) .  Under  these  standards,  the  conditions  identified\npreviously in the court's Findings of Fact constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment and violate the Eighth Amendment.\nPrison officials also violate the Eighth Amendment when they\nact with deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical\nneeds.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 997, 105-106  (1976).  Mental\nhealth  needs  are  no  less  serious  than physical  needs.  See,\nPartridge v. Two Unknown Police Officers of City of Houston, Texas.\n791  F.2d  1182,  1187  (5th  Cir.  1986) .  The  evidence  clearly\nestablishes that defendants have been deliberately indifferent to\n-11-\n\nm  U:\\\\ m  JUDGE DAVIS ,  FAX NO.  6623691039  P. 14\nthe  Death  Row  inmates'  serious  mental  health  needs  by  the\nconditions  and  practices  identified  in  the  court's  Findings  of\nPact.\nFinally, the fact that MDOC has attained ACA accreditation for\nthe  Mississippi  State  Penitentiary  does  not  moot  the  claims  of\nplaintiffs.  see,  Friends  of  the  Earth.  Inc.  v.  Lordlaw\nEnvironmental Services  (TOO, Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190  (2002).\nIV.  Remedial Actions\nHaving found that defendants' have violated plaintiffs' Eighth\nAmendment rights in numerous ways, the court directs the following\nremedial action:\n(1)  If defendants wish to continue  the practice  of  moving\ninmates from cell-to-cell in Unit 32-C, they will insure\nthat the cell to which an inmate is moved is clean prior\nto the move.

If the heat index reaches 90\ndegrees or above, the defendants will  insure that each\ncell is equipped with a fan, that ice water is available\nto each inmate, and that each inmate may take one shower\nduring  each day when  the heat  index  is  90  degrees  or\nabove.

Their cells are\ndimly li; reading writiig, and any kind of sustained and focused thought are internpted by the\nconstant screams, moans, curses, animal noises, maniacal laughter, and halluchatory ravhgs, night and\nday,  of severely mentally ill prisoners  in adjacent eels.\n13.  DeathRow hrmtes are alowed to exercise onfy four hours per week, in an outdoor cage\nscarcely larger than a eel, in which the onfy exercise possible is walking in small circles. Many Death\nRow himtes nust foiego the exercise pen during the heat of summer because the pens aie completely\nexposed to the sun, and inmates are not allowed water or a hat, nor are they entitled to shower when\ntheyreturn from exercise. During cold weather, inmates often mist forego the exercise pen because\ntheir cbthhgis inadequate, and by MDOC policy theyha\\e no shoes, onfy plastic thong-type shower\nsandals.  The lack of exercise available to DeathRow prisoners who spend yeais is isolation\ncompounds mental health problems as welas hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic\nillnesses.\n14.  Visits wih femiry are limited to a one-hour no-contact visit through glass, twfce a month, and\nonly on week days, making it difficult if not impossible for working famify members and femiy members\nat a distance to visit, particularly because Parchman is bcated in an isolated part of the Delta, to which\naccess by public transportation is costly and linked.  Telephone calls wih femiry are prohbitivefy\nexpensive for most inmates since MDOC imposes charges fir hgher than the charges for equivalent\ncollect calls h the community. Once a call is placed,  MDOC telephone service repeatedly cuts the\nconnection.\n\n15.  Prison nibs, policies and practices severely curtai Death Row prisoners' rght to correspond\nwith fimify, friends, bved ones, supporters, and legal counsel.  Prison nies prohbit Death Row hmates\nfrom purchasing more than twenty stanps per week, and prison staff puiish Death Row hmates tor\neven minor rub infractions with bss of the privilege of purchasing postage.  Mail to Death Row hmates\nis routinely mi-delivered or returned to the sender for compbtely arbitrary reasons or for no\ndiscernible reason\n16.  DeathRow hmates have no access whatsoever to educational or vocatbnal programs,  prison\njobs, or mental health counseling or even access to such solitary pastimes as phyhg cards or hobby\ncrafis.\n17.  Death Row prisoners ha\\e no access to any sort of reKgbus servbes or fellowship. Every other\nweek, a prison  chaplah or wlunteer passes through the tiers and passes out tracts, but spends no\nmore than five minutes, if that, with hmates seeking religious counseling\n18.  Without legitimate penologbal justification, Defendants hinder communbations between  Death\nRow hmates and their counsel. Accommodations fcr legal visits are so inadequate that visits from\ncounsel who must travel many hours to  Parcbman to visit Death Row clients are often truncated; fegal\nvisits are permitted only in an area which makes it difficult or impossible for Death Row prisoners to\ncommunicate confidentially with their counsel; and legal tebphone calls are arbitrarily curtailed.\n19.  The profound and long-term isolation, idbness, and monotony of the hmates' lives cause severe\ndeterioration of their mental healh.  Prison staff and administrators farther htensify ths isolation and\nmonotony by punishing even the slightest rub infection wih permanent confiscation of inmates' radbs,\ntelevisions, and typewriters, and wih bss of the privilege of purchasing postage. Such puushments\ncbse off the prisoners' on^ rerminhg contacts wih the outside world and the onfy means bftto them\n\nfor mitigating their profound isolation.\nDeprivation of basic sanitation and personal hygiene\n20.  Defendants expose the Death Row inmates to grossly unsanitary living condiions, depriving\nthem of flie means to maintain base personal hygiene and human dignity, and contributhgto mental\nillness. The plumbing is dysfunctional throughout Uni 32: almost every cell has a \"ping-pong\" toifet,\nwhich, when flushed, pushes excrement and waste into the bowl in the adjohhgcell  The celb,\nhalways and showers are chronically filthy. An owrwhekningty strong stench pervades the Unit, some\nof it fromflthon the tier, some of it fom a cesspool adjacent to the Uni, some of it from the defecti\\e\nplumbing and phg-pong toilets, some of it caused by flooding which drenches inmates' cells and soaks\ntheir mattresses and beddhgwith filthy water that is allowed to stand for days at a time.  Severe^\nmentally ill inmates throw food and excrement on the floor of their cells and the halways, which prison\nstaff alow to decompose for days or even weeks.  Correctfanal staff alow severe^ mentally il palierts\nto go without showers and to leave flier toilets unflushed for weeks at a time, subjecting all other\ninrmtes to the stench.\n21.  The Uni is never dishfected or given any kind of meaningful cleaning  The showers and hals are\nfilthy; correctional staff do not supervise the inmates assigned to clean them. Staff provide inmates with\ncleanhg supples to cban flier cells onty about twee a month, but e\\en (hen provides onfy filthy water\n(the same bucket ofwaterfor26  cells) and  onfy one bottle ofdisinfectart to cban the toilets for\nseveral tiers.\n22.  Death Row inmates are served uncfean food.  The carts where food trays are stacked are filthy;\nthe trays on wheh the food is served are cracked and encrusted wifli the residue from other inmates'\nprevious meals. If food arrives when flie sewagp is backing up, correctional staff simply roll the food\n\ncarts through the raw sewags.  In some cells, inmates cannot eat a meal without flhgirg away roaches,\nand cannot set down flier food trays without roaches swarming over them.\n23.  The air in Uni 32 is dank.  Water pours into the cells from the outside when i rahs, and ffom\ncelt above when mentalyil hastes flood their toilets, a frequent occurrence. When this occurs,\ninmates' beds and cbthhgincelb below are soaked with fcul water and waste. There are no drahs h\nthe floor, and the inmates are not given supples to cban up the waste water, so they mist remain h fcul\nstanding water for prolonged periods, and must live with their filthy soaked bedding and clothhg until\nthe next laundry day.  Even when beddhgand cbthing is sent to the  laundry, it comes back stained,\ndamp, and foul-smelling Death Row hmates are not provided a change of sheets or bedding when\ntheir bedding is at the laundry, they must sleep on a bare dirty plastb mattress.\n24.  Death Row hmates  are routhefy denied access to showers fcr 4 or even 5 consecutive days\nevery week, even in summer months.  The showers are so filthy that some hmates cannot bear to use\nthem, even for the opportunity of bavhg their cells or cooling down in Ihe summer.\n25.  Not inffequentfy, the sewag3 system breaks down entirety. Beghning on June 23,2002,  there\nwas no water h Uni 32 for six or seven days.  Inmates were not able to wash or flush their toilets and\nsewage backed up into al of the eels.  The air was intobrably hurrid and foul.  Despite the punishing\nheat in the cells, prison staff  allowed hmates only  a six-ounce cup ofwater with each meaL\nLack of Adequate Shelter From Extreme Heat, Cold, Rain, and Vermin\n26.  The eels h Unit 32 where the Death Row inmates are housed provide inadequate shelter.  In\nwet weather rain floods many of the cells, and in feezing weather the cells are very cold.  From May to\nOctober, when the air temperature at Parchman routinely exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit for days at a\ntime, often accompanbd by extremely high humidity, the ceDs where Plaintiffs are confned for 23 or 24\n\nhours a day become dangerously hot and airless.\n27.  Ventilation fa the cells is grossly inadequate.  Fans in Ihe hallways provide little or no vertilatbn\nto the eels.  The most fortunate of the Death Row inmates have a small electric faninther cells,\npurchased from the canteen, but others cannot afford a fan, and still others have had their fens\npermanently confiscated for rules infractions ~ including exceedfagly rrinor fafractbns. Those famates\nwho do have fens find that the fens are useless in the hottest weather.\n28.  From May through September, Unit 32 swarms with clouds ofmosquioes, gnats, horsefies, and\nmany other kinds of fasects whch breed in the cesspool outside the Uni, and harass the famates every\nmoment of the day and night,  hi many cells, swarms of beetles, mosquitoes and other insects cover the\ninmates' bodies and the famates' food and water.  The mosquito and fasect infestation is so severe that\ninmates are forced to cbse their window and cover themselves up as much as possible with cbthes and\nbedding despite the sweltering heat\n29.  Even with cell temperatures routinely reaching well above 90 degrees Fahrenheit durfag the\nsummer months, the prisoners are permitted to shower only three tines per week and are routine^\ndenied access to showers for 4 or even 5 consecuti\\e days. In their desperation to find relief from the\nintense heat, some prisoners use the toilet bowel for drinkfag water and to wet down ther bodies.\n30.  Conditions such as these, wheh subject the prisoners to probnged exposure to high ambient\ntemperatures and humidity, pose a life-threatening health risk as well as a significant risk to the\nprisoners' mental health. Heat-related illnesses serious^ exacerbate respiratory, circulatory, and many\nother chronic ilresses. Sleep deprivation, resulting from prolonged exposure to high terrperatures,\ncompounds other emotional stressors that bad to mental breakdown  Heat siroke is a Kfe-threatening\nemergency and, unless promptly and energetically treated, can result h convulsbns, renal faiure,\n\ncirculatory collapse, and permanent brain damage.\n31.  The primary risk factors for heatstroke during heat waves inciide probnged stay in\nnon-air-condibned places; age (the risk increases with age); and a number of interactive medical\nconditions and medications.  These conditions and medications cause hyperthermia, heatstroke  or heat\ndeath by incapacitatiig a person's ability to control bodytenperature during periods of high ambient\ntemperatures.  Among the many medical condiions that diminish the body's ability to regukte its\ntemperature are hyperihyrokiism, heart disease, kidney disease, vascular insufficiency, obesity and\nmental illness. Among the many medications that impede the body' s ability to adjust to high ambient\ntemperatures are most psychiatric medications, many anti-hypertensive medications, diuretics,\nantihistamirES, and several heart medications.\n32.  All ofthe Plaintiffs have one or more of these high-risk characteristics; many ofthe prisoners\nhave multiple hgh-risk characteristics for heat-stroke and are at acuate risk.\nNoise Level and Sleep Deprivation\n33.  Death Row inmates are chronical^ sleep- deprived.  They are exposed night and day to the\npandemoniim created by serbusfy mentalyil hmates, who express their suffering and halicinatbns h\nceaseless raving, screaming, curshg, animal noises, moans, and shrieks; during the summer months, the\nDeath Row inmates are exposed around the cbck to intense heat and humidity, hck of ventilation, and\nlack of protection from mosquitoes; during fieezhg weather, they have inadequate bedding when it\nrains, water pours onto ther beds, especially h PhintffWillie Russell's \"punishment eel\"  The hmates\nsleep fitfuhy when they fall unconscious from exhaustion.  Sleep deprivation results in cognitive\nproblems, memory deficits, confusbn, and anxiety, and htensifbs psychiatric symptoms.\nAccess to Medical, Mental Health and Dental Care\n\n34.  Inmates with serbus medical, mertal health and dental needs have grossly inadequate access to\ncare.  Correctbnaland medical staff routine^ ignore requests for urgert, dangerous and extremely\npainfil medical, dental and mental health problems of Death Row hmates, for weeks at a tine.  A\nnurse waks through the tier each day, but never carries any equpment to check vital signs and if an\ninmate has a medical complaint the nurse merely says to fil out a sick-call slip.  Usually inmates must\nsubmit several foims before actually going to die health services, and they seldom receive rreanhgfii\ncare.  Mertal health treatment is nonexistent except for prescriptbn of medications; no counseling of\nany kind is provided.\nAbuse of severely mentally ill inmates\n35.  A number oftheDeathRow hmates, as well as other inmates housed h Uni 32, are severely\nmenially E  Inmates who corns to Death Row fa relative^ soind mental health are at high risk of\ndevebpingserbus menial illness as a result of the near-total isolatbn, idleness and barbarous conditbns\non Uni 32; those who come to Unit 32 with serbus mertal ihess are at high risk of being reduced to\npsychosis, mania, or compulsive acts of self-abuse.  Correctional staff taurt and abuse se\\erely\nmenially ill inmates and negject their basic human needs, allowing them to go without showers for\nmonths at a the, and without food fcr days at a time.\nNonfunctional Administrative Remedy Program\n36.  Prisoners' efforts to seek administrative redress through the Administrative Remedy Program\n(ARP) are gnored, and the ARP is barefy iinctbnal  There is a huge backbg of RARs (Request for\nAdministrative Remedies), yet prison officials process no more than one RAR at a time. Although i is\nsupposed to take no more than 90 days to complete on RAR, i common^ takes a year. Prison officials\nroutine^ ignore the RAR for several months or bnger; or, once the process beghs, they simply ignore\n\nthe time periods required by the ARP guidelines for their responses.  An 'Emergency Request\" is\nsupposed to be processed immediately when a delay night compromise an investigation or when a\nperson will suffer ongoing, adverse conditions.  However, regardless of the urgency of the request and\nthe need for an emergency rerredy, prison officials backlog emergency  requests and take years to\nprocess Ihem\nWILLIE RUSSELL\n37.  PlahtffWillie Russell has been on Death Row for more than 11 years and has been confined\nfor two years to Cel225, one offotr \"punishment\" cells. He is bcked down 23 or 24 houis a day.\nHis eel is strpped bare. He exists fa aknost total isolation torn other human behgs and in a state of\nperpetual forced idleness. He is allowed one hour of exercise, four times a week, fa an outdoor pen\nscarce^ larger than his cell where the onfy exercise possfole is waking in small circles.  His tefevsbn\nand radio were permanently conffceated two years ago, under a forfeiture polcy that was implemented\nonly after the rule violation with which he was charged.  He is not allowed stamps so he cannot write\nletters to fenfly, fiends, or supporters.  The metalbarred door of Hs eel has been overlaid wih a solid\nPlexghs door, which plinges him into nearly total and permanent isolation; he cannot tak with anyone\nor hear what aryone is saying outside hs eel  Almost the onty voices to reach him are those of\nseverely mentally 11 prisoners in nearby cells, who create a pandemoniimof screams and ravfag day\nand night. He is not allowed any phone cals wih fiends or femiry. His onty activities are reading and\nsleeping A dim light bums fa Mr. Russell's room 24 hours a day, the light is so low that he must strain\nhis eyes to read, and at nght it disturbs his sleep. Every day he stains to read books until he fells\nasleep, because he cannot communicate with anyone.\n38.  The heat duringthe summer fa Mr. Russel's special \"punishment\"' cell is partcuhrfy unbeatable.\n\nThe Ptexjghs door cbses off cross-vertilation and holds heat in the cell, creathg a hot-box.  The onfy\nprovision for \"vertilation\" is a series of tiny hobs the diameter of a pencil drilled into the Plexgks door\nnear the ceiling. MDOC officials permanently confiscated his fan two years ago. The window in his\ncell, a western exposure,  only makes it hotter since the sun shines directly onto his bed during the\nafternoon and be is forbidden to hang a towel over the window as a shade.  He often lies down on the\nconcrete floor close to the door see king relief from the heat but is subject to discphne for tying on the\nfbor. During the summer, k is often diffcul for Mr. Russell to breathe.  When he manages to doze off,\nhe awakes drenched in sweat.\n39.  Mosquitoes and many other insects pour into Mr. Russell's eel through the broken window\nframe.  During the summer months, Ihe hsect infestation B SO intolerable that he is forced to keep his\nwindow cbsed despite the intense heat. Even with Ihe window closed, insects swarm around his face\nand body.  Because he cannot turn off the light in his cell, the insects are especially drawn to it. The onty\ndefense he has against the insects is to cover himself with a sheet, no matter how intense the heat; for\nnearly two years, however, unti recently, he was denied a sheet, and even a mattress or pillows or any\nkind of normal bedding and slept on a concrete skb with a singte blanket\n40.  Inmates who aie being held in Uni 32 for disciplinary reasons are housed on the floor above\nMr. Russell; they ofien flood ther toilets when they want to get the guards' attention and the water\nfloods down the walls into Mr. Russell's eel He has no way to get rid of the standing water. When i\nrains, water pours down the wals of Mr. Russell's cell, soaks his bed and  collects on the floor.\nBecause of the constant dampness in his cell, there is a smell of sour mildew and mold.  Mr. Russell's\ncell is always dirty.  He cannot use hs own soap to clean Ihe eel because he gets onfy one bar a week\nwhich hsts only through three five-minute showers.\n\n41.  The window h Mr. Russell's eel does not completely cbse, so that in feezing weather cold air\nfbws onto his bed .\n42.  Mr. Russell is taking Remeron for depression and anxiety and Neurontin fer seizure disorder. At\ntimes his body shakes uncontrollably. His medication puts him at high risk for heat siroke during hot\nweather.  Eating causes hin pain; he is nauseated most of time and i is becoming increasingly difficult\nfor hin to swallow food or even water.  MDOC has not provided testing and treatrrentor medication\nfor pain for this condition.\nJOHN NIXON\n43.  Plaintiff John Nixon is 74 years old.  He has asthma and emphysema.  In the summer, the\ntemperature in his cell becomes unbearably hot and he has great difficulty breathing  He is without a fen\nand as the vertilation system is broken no ar circulates through bis eel  MDOC rules forbid hin from\nplacing a towelover his whdow to deflect the heat.  He has to keep flie window in his eel cbsed;\nwhen i is open, mosquioes and gnats  swarm in and hover around his eyes and nose and ciawlinto his\nears.  During cold winter weather, he is always cold since prison offbials took away Death Row\ninmates' shoes, most of their clothes, and most ofther bedding. Mr. Nixon is sickened by the waste\nfrom neighboring cells flushing into toe toibt in his eel\n44.  Mr. Nixon has been suffering from a severe oozhg rash on his arms and legs fer over seven\nyears. When he asked doctor for help, saying,  'Please help me, doctor, this rash is killing me,\" the\ndoctor laughed and said, \"Well John, thats what they sent you down here for, isn't i?\"\n45.  Mr. Nixon B very weak and has difficulty walking.  He has chronic problems win Hs feet and\nhas a prescription for special shoes, but has not been alowed to wear them since MDOC prohibited all\nDeath Row hrrates ffomwearhg shoes.  Therefore he leaves his bunk onty to eat and to shower.\n\n46.  Mr. Nixon used to go outside to the exercise pen when permitted, but six years ago when he\nwas out on the yard during winter i started rainirg, and the guards kept him bcked there for two hours\nin a storm  He fears that if the same thing happened again, he would not survive t.\n47.  Mr. Nixon spends hi days in aknost complete idleness and isolation.  He used to read, but\nafter years h the dimlght of his cell, it is becoming increasingly difficult for hin to see.  His eyesght also\nmakes writing diffbult.  He leaves his cell a total of 30 minutes a week in order to shower.  The\nshowers are filthy and he does not like to use them, but does so in order to break the otherwise\ncompletely unrelieved monotony of his days.\n48.  Mr. Nixon witnessed Mr. C., another long-time Death Row inmate, turn from an intelligent,\nrespectfilman with gpod bearing when he arrived at Death Row to a man possessed, who screams\nand pkys in his own exciement\nTRACY HAN SEN\n49.  PlahtffTracyHansen has been on Death Row shce 1987. Inthattimehehas  suffered\nintense, of en ongoing pah, and near rrental collapse.  He has asthma and respiratory problems, which\nare aggravated by the extreme heat,  humidity and lack of \\entilatbn h the cells durhgthe summer\nmonths; he has great difficulty breathing during the hot weather but is not permitted to have a fan.  He\nsuffers from extreme anxiety, for which he takes psychiatric medications. Prison staff frequency\nwithhold his prescription medications from hin.  Over the years, he has been forced to go without his\npsychiatric medication for bng periods of time whenever the guards decide to punish him for\ncomplaining about condibns on the Unit.  On other occasbns, ftie guards have beaten him for\ncomplaining about his medicatbns.\n50.  Mr. Hansen has over a perbd of years repeatedly requested, to no avai,  to have a doctor\n\nexamine a growth on his back.  He has had many serious derial problems for which he has been denied\ntimely and appropriate treatment; in al cases, he has had to wait many months to see a dentist even\nwhen fa extreme pain.\n51.  Mr. Hansen's television, radio and typewriter were confiscated over a year ago. The lack of\nactivity and mental stimuhtbn serbusry affects Mr. Hansen's state of mind, as does the pandemoniim\ncreated by severely mentally ill inmates in nearby cells\n52.  Mr. Hansen has repeatedly attempted over the years to seek redress concerning al the\ncondibns alleged fa this Complaint through MDOC's Adninistrative Remedy Program, to no aval\nHe presently has an active RAR regarding being denied recreatbn that is over 3 years old.  He has had\nan \"Emergency Request,\" regardfag deprivation of his prescribed medications, pending for 3 years\nwhen i was finaly processed.  When Mr. Hansen  complained that water was flooding fom the ceiling\ninto his cell on a constant basis, the First Step Response came back as, \"there B no flooding in your\ncell\" When he filed hi appeal saying that the response to his RAR was incorrect, no member of the\nARP checked to see what the true situation was in his cell  Years later, nothing has been done. Mr.\nHansen's most recent appeal was of a disciplinary convctbn.  His appeal was returned to him\nunprocessed.  He was told that because he had 10 RARs pending, they woiid not process his request\nfor an appeal\nSHERWOOD BROWN\n53.  Plafatff Sherwood Brownhas been on Death Row for nine years. He has high blood pressure,\na heart condition, and severe migraines.  He takes mediations for all of these conditions.  These\nmedical condibns, and the medications he takes to cortrolthem, put him at high risk for heat-related\nillness and serbus physicalinjury.  Although he has ahistoryof good institutbnalbehavior, MDOC\n\nconfiscated his fen, radio, television and typewriter for wearing an earring.\nKELVIN JORDAN\n54.  Kelvii Jordan has been on Death Row fcr nearly six years.  He has seen inmates deteriorate\nmentally and lose their sanity on Death Row, and he trbs to maintain his own but on some days is too\ndepressed to get out of bed. Mr. Jordan has no radio because the carteendoes not sell them, and has\nno tebvision because he cannot affoid one.  He Ices writing letters but no bnger does so since he is\nbarred ffom buying stamps as punishment for participating in Ihe January 2002 hunger strike.  55.\nMr. Jordan has chronb severe headaches.  The constant screaming and slammrig of trays by the\nseriously mental^ ill inmates triggers his headaches. He also has a chronic rash.  The extreme heat in his\ncell also triggers his migraine headaches, and occasionally causes him to get dizzy and black out.  He\nseldom sees a doctor because it takes several days or weeks to get an appointment,  inmates are\ncharged fcr every clinb visit, and the doctors seldom provide any treatment\nPAUL WOODWARD\n56.  Paul Woodward has been on Death Row for eleven years and five months.  He is obese and\nhas high bbod pressure, respiratory problems, and poor circulation; his feet and ankles are constantly\nswollen and painfii  He takes cbnidire, aspirin, zaroxo^n, and zestri  Mr. Wodward's medical\nconditions and medications put hin at great risk for heat stroke during the hot weather. He routine^\nexperiences delays of a week or bnger in receiving refills of his prescription rredkatbns, even though\nhe submits sick call foims and pleads wih the nurse on rounds fcr assistance.  When his medicatbn\nlapses, he feels hB chest tghten, and he Kves in constant fear that he is about to have a heart attack.\n57.  Although Ihe walls in his eel radiate the heat like a sto\\e, Mr. Woodward camot keep his\nwindow openbecause  mesh saeenon the window B too large, and bts in cbuds ofmosquioes, and\n\ntiny black insects that crawl all over his skin. Even with Ihe window closed, mosquitoes enter his cell;\nduring the summer he spends muchof toe dayswattingat the swarming mosquioes.\n58.  Mr. Woodward's chronic medical conditions make it difficult for him to breathe, and these\nconditions are severefy exacerbated by Ihe poorvertilatbn and flthin Uni 32. In late June 2002 he\nhad a severe asthma attack. He was not seen by a doctor.\n59.  Since MDOC confiscated all Death Row inmates' shoes and made them wear \"dp-flops\"\n(plastic thong-sandals), Mr. Woodward's circulatory problems hare worsened.  The plastic sandab\ncutoffhis circulation, his feet and toes have turned purpb and numb, he can scarcely walk, and the pain\nis excruciating. When he has to walk, blood blisters form on his feet along the sides of the plastic\nthongs.  He has had a lesfon on his buttocks for years for which he has received no treatment 60.\nThe showers are so fittiy that Mr. Woodward has  stopped using them  He bathes h the sink\nin his cell  There is a ping-pong toilet in his celt when he flushes the toibt, the waste ends up in the\nbowl of ihe neighboring inmate's eel, and vice versa.\n61.  Mr. Woodward spends all his time watching television as there is notfihg else to do and he feels\nit is the onfy way he can hope to maintain his sanity.  Mr. Woodward has witnessed the mental\ndeterioration of an inmate on Death Row: Ten years ago, Mr. Woodward found Mr. C. to be a\ncourteous, likeable, quiet and cbanperson, who talked of his femfly and his hometown; now, Mr. C.\nscreams constartly, neither bathes nor flushes the toilet,  throws his feces everywhere, and looks,\nsmells, and acts ike a frightened aninaL\nGeneral Factual Allegations\n62.  The conditbns described in this Complaint result in gratuitous pain and suffering and pose an\nirrmiient dan^r of serious physical and mental ilness, injury, or death to Plahtiffc.\n\n63.  In imposing the conditions described in this Complaint, Defendants have acted with deliberate\nindifference to plaintifls' serious medical, health, and safety needs, and to the risk that plaintiffs will\nsuffer serious illness, injury, or death.  The conditions described herein are not reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological objectives.\n64.  The conditions descried in this Complaint are likely to persist unless enjoined by this Court.\nExhaustion of Administrative  Remedies\n65.  The Plairtiffs have exhausted alladmiiistrati\\e remedies available to them on the matters\nalleged above. The Pkintiffi, through counsel, submitted a request tor an administrative remedy on\nJanuary 31, 2002, and pursued the request through discussions and correspondence with\nCommissioner Johnson on February 13, 2002, February21, 2002, March8, 2002, March 12, 2002,\nApril 1, 2002, April 15, 2002, June 7, 2002, and June 14, 2002. Administratne remedies were\nexhausted on or before June 14, 2002, which was more than ninety days after the orighalrequest.\nCLASS ACTION FACTS\n66.  PlaintifS bringthis action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, pursuant to\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2).\n67.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all Death Row prisoners who are now, or will h\nthe future be, confned at Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchrmn, Mississippi\n68.  There are currertlyapproximately 65 Death Row prisoners confned at Uni 32.  The members\nof tfie class are too nimerous, and the membership of flie chss too fluid, to permit johder of all\nmembers.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all chss members. All class members are\nequally subject to the unconstitutional and unlawful conditions described in this Comphirt.  These\ncommon questions hchde, but are not limited to, whether conditions of confinement for Death Row\n\nprisoners at Parchman violate the Fiist, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendmenis to the United States\nConstitution; and whether the systemieally hadequate medical, mental health, and dental care provided\nto the Death Row inmates violates the Eghth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n69.  The clams of the named plahtiffi are typical of those of the class.\n70.  Plaintiffi wil flirty and adequately represent the hterests of the class.

Dept. of Corrections, *327 Parchman, MS, for\nDefendants-Appellants.\nBefore DeMOSS, DENNIS and PRADO, Circuit Judges.\nDENNIS, Circuit Judge:\nWillie Russell (\"Russell\") brought suit in the Northern District of Mississippi against officials of the Mississippi\nDepartment of Corrections (\"MDOC\") on behalf of himself and other prisoners confined to Death Row, or Unit 32-\nC, in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi. Russell alleges that certain conditions of\nconfinement on Death Row violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. By\nconsent of the parties, the case was tried to the magistrate judge, who found several Eighth Amendment\n[1]\nviolations and entered injunctions designed to alleviate those conditions. MDOC appealed.  We affirm in part\n[2]\nand vacate in part.\nBACKGROUND\nRussell argues that the prisoners housed on Death Row are knowingly and deliberately subjected to profound\nisolation, lack of exercise, stench and filth, malfunctioning plumbing, high temperatures, uncontrolled mosquito\nand insect infestations, a lack of sufficient mental health care, and exposure to psychotic inmates in adjoining\ncells. On May 21, 2003, the trial court issued a \"Memorandum Opinion\" containing its findings of fact and\nconclusions of law in which the court found that a number of the conditions alleged by Russell violated the Eighth\nAmendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. That same day, the court also issued a \"Final\n\nJudgment\" in which it mandated that MDOC comply with injunctive relief designed to alleviate those conditions.\nMDOC timely appealed. The trial court denied MDOC's motion for a stay pending appeal. MDOC then filed a\nmotion for stay pending appeal with this court; we granted MDOC's motion.\nANALYSIS\nShould this case be dismissed because it was not brought in\naccordance with the Gates v. Collier class action framework?\n328 MDOC first argues that this case should have been brought under the *328 framework for enforcing injunctive\nrelief on the Mississippi prison system provided by Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir.1974). MDOC bases\nthis argument on this court's decision in Gillespie v. Crawford, 858 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir1998). The plaintiff in \nGillespie attempted to bring suit in federal district court challenging prison conditions in Texas state prison. At that\ntime, a separate district court still retained jurisdiction over Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F.Supp. 1265 (S.D.Tex.1980), a\nclass action that successfully challenged unconstitutional Texas prison conditions, to monitor the prison system\nuntil the injunctions issued in Ruiz had been met. See Gillespie, 858 F.2d at 1102. The Gillespie court stated:\nSeparate individual suits may not be maintained for equitable relief from allegedly unconstitutional\nTexas prison conditions. To allow individual suits would interfere with the orderly administration of\nthe class action and risk inconsistent adjudications. Individual members of the class and other\nprisoners may assert any equitable or declaratory claims they have, but they must do so by urging\nfurther action through the class representative and attorney, including contempt proceedings, or\nby intervention in the class action.\nId. at 1103.\nGates involved alleged constitutional deficiencies in the Mississippi prison system, and in 1998, after twenty-five\nyears of oversight, the District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi finally dismissed the action from its\ninactive docket as to state-owned, state-operated, and private-company-contracted facilities (not as to county\nfacilities), complimenting the state on its compliance with prior orders. No. GC-71-6. The court stated:\nThis dismissal shall be without prejudice for the plaintiffs, through counsel, to petition the Court to\nreopen the case or a portion thereof in order to enforce, amend, or seek additional injunctive\nrelief.... This dismissal shall not apply to any order of the court with respect to the payment of\nattorneys fees and costs/expenses to plaintiffs' counsel, who shall, post-dismissal, continue to\nmonitor compliance in state-owned, state-operated, and private-company-contracted facilities....\n[T]he court finds and concludes that the rule of [Gillespie] will continue to apply in this case with\nrespect to prisoners in state-owned, state-operated, and private-company-contracted facilities,\nand the court will continue to forward such prisoner petitions to plaintiffs' class counsel.\nNo. GC-71-6. Thus, in writing this dismissal order for Gates, the court apparently assumed that Gates was the\nsole vehicle for future prisoner complaints. Although Russell argues that the court only intended Gates as an\noption for seeking future equitable relief, the court's invoking the rule of Gillespie indicates that it was meant to be\nthe sole vehicle.\nBut it does not appear that the reasoning of Gillespie is applicable here. The Gillespie court justified its rule as\nfollows:\nPermitting multiple courts to entertain equitable claims and issue decrees that might affect the\nTexas prison system would require other courts to become familiar with the Ruiz decree, the\ncurrent problems of the Texas prison system, and the possible disruptive effect of the exercise of\nequitable powers over matters covered by the Ruiz decree. Moreover, if separate suits for\nequitable relief are filed in other districts than that in which Ruiz is pending, even with respect to\nproblems not encompassed by the relief granted in Ruiz, the court's orders may hobble the effect\n\n329 of the Ruiz court's continuing decree over the Texas *329 prison system and its power both to\nenforce and to modify that decree.\nId. at 1103. As this passage illustrates, the Gillespie court was concerned with avoiding the inefficiency of a\nsituation in which multiple courts would be forced to familiarize themselves with the problems of the Texas prison\nsystem. Similarly, the court was concerned with the increased confusion and decreased effectiveness that would\nlikely arise if multiple district courts were simultaneously exercising equitable powers over the state prison\nsystem.\nIn the present case, the district court judge who was the author of the Gates dismissal order assigned this case to\nthis magistrate judge in light of this magistrate's previous experience with Gates. Thus, we are not here faced\nwith either the problem of a new district court being forced to get up to speed on the factually-intensive problems\nof the state prison system or with the problem of multiple district courts simultaneously exercising equitable\npowers over the prison system. Additionally, the magistrate judge purported to consolidate this case with Gates\nafter certifying the death row inmates as a subclass of Gates. MDOC argues that this is not sufficient, citing\ncases stating that \"consolidation does not merge [multiple] suits into a single cause.\" See, e.g.,Johnson v.\nManhattan R. Co., 289 U.S. 479, 53 S.Ct. 721, 77 L.Ed. 1331 (1933). Nevertheless, because of the consolidation\nand because the same judge has jurisdiction over the present action and Gates, the problems addressed by the \nGillespie court are not present here.\nMDOC points out that the Gates class counsel and class representative are not being utilized. But MDOC does\nnot articulate what difference that makes, and we find it to be of no import. In fact, this court has already\nrecognized that it may be proper for different counsel to represent a Gates subclass. See Gates v. Cook, 234\nF.3d 221, 227-30 (5th Cir.2000) (reversing the district court's denial of a motion for substitution of counsel by a \nGates subclass comprised of HIV-positive prisoners in the Mississippi prison system). Because this case was\ndealt with by the same court and judge who dealt with Gates and was consolidated with Gates, the concerns\nbehind Gillespie are not present here and there is thus not any reason to dismiss this case.\nShould this case have been dismissed because of the class members'\nalleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies?\nMDOC argues that the judgment should be vacated and the case dismissed because the trial court did not\nrequire all of the inmates who are members of the present class to exhaust their administrative remedies. The\nplaintiffs respond that the named plaintiff, Russell, did exhaust his administrative remedies, and that no more is\nrequired. MDOC disputes the plaintiffs' contention that Russell exhausted his administrative remedies.\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") mandates that \"[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison\nconditions... by a prisoner ... until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" 42 U.S.C.A. §\n1997e(a). The Supreme Court has held that \"the PLRA's exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about\nprison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes.\" Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516,\n532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). The Court made clear that exhaustion is now mandatory. Id. at 524,\n122 S.Ct. 983. This court has held that the available administrative remedy must be pursued to its conclusion. \n330 Wright v. Hollingsworth, 260 F.3d 357 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, if the plaintiffs did not exhaust administrative *330\nremedies, this suit should be dismissed.\nThe trial court found that Russell was the only class member who had completed the MDOC Administrative\nRemedy Program (\"ARP\"). If true, this is enough to satisfy the requirement for the class. See, e.g., Oatis v.\nCrown Zellerbach Corp., 398 F.2d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir.1968) (exhaustion of remedies requirement satisfied for\nclass action if named plaintiff representing class exhausted remedies); 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &\nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1776 (2d ed. 1986) (\"[W]hen prospective relief is the\nprimary remedy being sought, a representative who has exhausted his administrative remedies may bring a class\nsuit on behalf of those who have not done so.\"). Thus, if Russell completed the ARP, exhausting administrative\nremedies, this case was ripe for adjudication. Again, the trial court found that Russell had completed the ARP and\n\nthat the record adequately reflected Russell's and his counsel's steps taken through the administrative remedy\nprocess. MDOC disagrees.\n[3]\nMDOC maintains that the ARP is a three-step process: 1) the inmate writes a letter  to the Superintendent/\nDeputy Commissioner in care of the Legal Claims Adjudicator that is referred to a respondent by the Legal\nClaims Adjudicator; 2) if dissatisfied, the inmate may request relief from the Superintendent/Deputy\nCommissioner; 3) if dissatisfied, the inmate may appeal to the Commissioner in care of the ARP Administrator.\nThe Commissioner will notify the inmate of his final decision within forty days of receiving the appeal. If a request\nis rejected for technical reasons or matters of form, the inmate is given five days from the date of rejection to file\na corrected grievance. The ARP also provides that \"[n]o more than ninety (90) days from initiation to completion\nof the process shall elapse, unless an extension has been granted\" and that \"expiration of response time limits\n[4]\nwithout receipt of a written response shall entitle the offender to move on to the next step in the process.\"\nThe ARP rules also provide that an inmate may make a request for emergency review by sending an emergency\nrequest to the Legal Adjudicator \"to determine to what level the grievance must be forwarded if substantive\nactions must occur. The request shall be handled as expeditiously as possible, and shall be reviewed at the\nCommissioner's level by the Commissioner or his designee.\" The emergency review procedures further provide\nthat, if the grievance is ruled not to be an emergency, it \"may be resubmitted as a regular grievance\" and that\n\"[a]buse of the emergency review process ... shall be treated as a frivolous or malicious request.\" The emergency\nreview procedure thus expedites the review process in certain situations so that the request can be dealt with\n331 expediently at the Commissioner's level.[5] The ARP *331 does not provide a definitive end for the emergency\nreview procedure, but, as the emergency review procedure facilitates quicker review at the Commissioner's level,\nit follows that the requirement that the Commissioner provide a written answer within forty days of receiving the\ncomplaint likewise applies to the emergency review procedure.\nRussell maintains that he exhausted his administrative remedies by utilizing the emergency review process. On\nJanuary 31, 2002, Russell's counsel delivered to MDOC Commissioner Johnson a document titled \"Emergency\nRequest by Inmate Willie C. Russell for an Administrative Remedy Concerning Conditions on Death Row,\"\ncomplaining of the conditions at issue here and requesting a meeting to discuss these problems in an effort to\n[6]\navoid litigation.  On March 8, before a March 12 meeting with Commissioner Johnson, Russell's counsel sent\nthe Commissioner a memorandum, outlining the complained of conditions on Death Row in greater detail.\nOn April 1, Russell's counsel sent a third letter to Commissioner Johnson referencing the original emergency\nrequest for an administrative remedy. This letter noted that Commissioner Johnson had agreed to remedy such\nconditions, if they existed, at the March 12 meeting. It further asked MDOC to respond by May 1 so as to inform\nRussell whether it would be able to make the necessary repairs by June 1. On April 15, Johnson sent a letter to\nRussell's counsel asserting that Russell's concerns regarding ventilation (heat) had been addressed by simply\ndrilling some holes in the metal sheet on his cell door and that the concerns regarding sanitation and pest control\nwere unwarranted. On June 14, Russell's counsel sent Johnson a final letter reiterating Russell's complaints and\ndisputing Johnson's April 15th denial of the accuracy of the inmates' claims; Commissioner Johnson never\nresponded. Throughout these negotiations, MDOC never rejected the emergency request on technical grounds\n332 or for matters of form nor advised Russell to resubmit it as a *332 regular grievance. On the contrary, MDOC\naddressed Russell's core concerns by simply disagreeing with Russell's characterization of the conditions on\nDeath Row.\nWe agree with the trial court that Russell concluded the ARP and thus exhausted administrative remedies.\nInitially, MDOC failed to comply with ARP procedures by failing to deal with Russell's complaint within the time\nlimits provided by the ARP. Over ninety days expired between the time that Russell initiated the process and the\ntime he finally filed suit, and Commissioner Johnson did not provide a written response to Russell's complaint\nwithin the forty day period. Available administrative remedies are exhausted in compliance with the PLRA when\nthe time limits for the prison's response set forth in the prison grievance procedures have expired. Underwood v.\nWilson, 151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.1998). Similarly, per the terms of the ARP, Commissioner Johnson's failure to\nprovide a written response to Russell's complaint within the forty day period entitled Russell to \"move on to the\nnext step in the process.\" As review at the Commissioner's level constitutes the final step in the process, Russell\n\nwas then entitled to file suit. Finally, even if MDOC was allowed to unduly delay the administrative process in\nviolation of the terms of the ARP by failing to provide an answer from Commissioner Johnson within the forty day\nperiod, the April 15th letter denied that relief was warranted, effecting a rejection of the claim. That letter thus\nterminated the administrative process, as evidenced by Commissioner Johnson's refusal to respond to any\nfurther communications regarding these complaints. We agree with trial court's conclusion that Russell completed\nthe ARP by utilizing the procedure for emergency review. Thus, Russell, and by extension the plaintiffs, properly\nexhausted administrative remedies.\nShould the injunctions be vacated on the grounds that they are not justified by conditions constituting cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment?\nThe Eighth Amendment Standard\nMDOC argues that none of the provisions of the injunctive decree were warranted by conditions constituting\nEighth Amendment violations. The Eighth Amendment dictates that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be\ninflicted, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and it is applicable to the States by reason of the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 675, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). The\ntreatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny\nunder the Eighth Amendment. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993).\nThe Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons, but neither does it permit inhumane ones. Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Prison officials must provide humane\nconditions of confinement; they must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical\ncare, and must take reasonable measure to ensure the safety of the inmates. Id. This circuit has worded the test\nas requiring extreme deprivation of any \"minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\" Davis v. Scott, 157 F.3d\n1003, 1006 (5th Cir.1998). Further, mental health needs are no less serious than physical needs. Partridge v. Two\nUnknown Police Officers of City of Houston, Texas, 791 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir.1986). The Supreme Court has\n333 made clear that the standards against which a *333 court measures prison conditions are \"the evolving standards\nof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\" and not the standards in effect during the time of the\ndrafting of the Eighth Amendment. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)\n(internal quotation omitted).\nA prison official has violated the Eighth Amendment when he 1) shows a subjective deliberate indifference to 2)\nconditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmate. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833-34, 114 S.Ct. 1970.\nWhether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact subject to\ndemonstration in the usual ways, including inference from circumstantial evidence, and a factfinder may conclude\nthat a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious. Id. at 842, 114 S.Ct.\n1970.\nConditions of confinement may establish an Eighth Amendment violation \"in combination\" when each would not\ndo so alone, but only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single,\nidentifiable human need such as food, warmth, or exercise 00 for example, a low cell temperature at night\n97\ncombined with a failure to issue blankets. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271\n(1991). The Supreme Court has noted that \"the length of confinement cannot be ignored.... A filthy, overcrowded\ncell... might be tolerable for a few days and intolerably cruel for weeks or months.\" Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678,\n686-87, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978). It is also important to note that the inmate need not show that\ndeath or serious illness has occurred. Helling, 509 U.S. at 32, 113 S.Ct. 2475 (\"It would be odd to deny an\ninjunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that\nnothing yet had happened to them.\").\nStandard of Review\nMDOC argues that many of the trial court's findings of fact were clearly erroneous. In reviewing the factual\nfindings, this court employs a \"clearly erroneous\" standard. Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 790 F.2d 1220, 1224 (5th\n\nCir.1986). A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the\nentire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Id. Whether the\nofficial showed a deliberate indifference to the condition is a factual finding that is reviewed under a \"clearly\nerroneous\" standard. Brice v. Virginia Beach Correctional Ctr., 58 F.3d 101, 105 (4th Cir.1995). Once the facts\nare established, the issue of whether the facts constitute a constitutional violation is a question of law to be\nreviewed de novo. Alberti, 790 F.2d at 1224. If a constitutional violation is found, we employ an abuse of\ndiscretion standard in reviewing the equitable remedy itself. Swann v. Charlotte 00 Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402\n97\nU.S. 1, 15-16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).\nThe Trial Court's Factual Findings\nThe trial court made the following findings of fact, inter alia, as to the conditions on Parchman's Death Row.\nSanitation\nInmates have been subjected to cells that were extremely filthy with chipped, peeling paint, dried fecal matter and\nfood encrusted on the walls, ceilings, and bars, as well as water from flooded toilets and rain leaks. Inmates are\nroutinely moved from cell to cell and are forced to clean their new cells that may have been left in horrendous\n334 sanitation by the prior occupants, *334 especially if the occupant were mentally ill. Adequate cleaning supplies\nand equipment are not routinely made available for inmates to clean their cells. These filthy conditions contribute\nto the infestation of pests and play a role in the mental well-being of inmates. Russell v. Johnson, 2003 WL\n22208029 at *2, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8576 at *4-5 (N.D.Miss.2003).\nHeating and Cooling\nThe summer temperatures in the Mississippi Delta average in the nineties with high humidity, and Death Row is\nprimarily not an air-conditioned facility. There are industrial type fans in the hallways to help with air circulation,\nand most inmates have smaller fans. Relief from the heat can be obtained by keeping the windows open in the\ncell using fans. But keeping the windows open increases the mosquito population in the cells since there are\nholes in the cell window screens and the screen gauge is not sufficient to keep mosquitoes out. The ambient\ntemperature in the cells is within reasonable limits except during the summer months. The ventilation is\ninadequate to afford prisoners a minimal level of comfort during the summer months. The probability of heat-\nrelated illness is extreme on Death Row, and is dramatically more so for mentally ill inmates who often do not\ntake appropriate behavioral steps to deal with the heat. Also, the medications often given to deal with various\nmedical problems interfere with the body's ability to maintain a normal temperature. The inmates are not afforded\nextra showers, ice water, or fans if they don't have fans when the heat index is 90 or above. The heat problem\nextends to all of Death Row and possibly throughout Parchman. Id. at *3, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8576 at *5-7.\nPest Control\nThe heat problem also exacerbates the problem of pest control. Mosquitoes in Mississippi, and the Delta in\nparticular, are a problem that cannot be eliminated. But the problem must be addressed and the impact lessened,\nespecially with the incidence of West Nile virus, a mosquito-born disease increasing in Mississippi. Inadequate\nscreening on the cell windows causes the inmates to choose between suffering from the heat or increasing the\nmosquitoes in their cells. The problems of heat and mosquitoes must be addressed to provide the inmates with\nconditions that would meet minimal constitutional standards. The problem of roaches and other vermin will be\nmet by adhering to the ACA standards and by meeting the sanitation goals the court will set. Id. at *3, 2003 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 8576 at *7.\n\n\"Ping-Pong\" Toilets and Plumbing\nFecal and other matter flushed by a toilet in one cell will bubble up in the adjoining cell unless the toilets are\nflushed simultaneously. This has been a problem since the unit opened. Parchman officials have identified the\nproblem as one of calibration, especially if the water is shut off. The toilets must be recalibrated to work properly.\nRecalibration has helped, but not eliminated, the problem of ping-pong toilets. No one in civilized society should\nbe forced to live under conditions that force exposure to another person's bodily wastes. The showers, water\ntemperature, and quality of water are adequate. Id. at *3, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8576 at *7-8.\nLighting\n335 The lighting in the cells is grossly inadequate. While 20 foot-candles[7] is the appropriate *335 level of lighting for\nthe cells, the maximum foot-candles measured by Russell's expert was seven or eight, with the typical cell being\nin the 2-4 foot-candle range. Id. at *3, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8576 at *9-10.\nPreventive Maintenance Program\nThe preventive maintenance program instituted by MDOC appears to be adequate, although it should be in\nwriting. Id. at *3, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8576 at *10.\nLaundry\nThe inmates' laundry is returned foul-smelling, necessitating the inmates to wash their clothes in their cells. The\ninmates are entitled to laundry that is clean and not foul-smelling. Id.\nMental Health Issues\nAt least six severely psychotic prisoners are housed on Death Row, and many more are diagnosed with\nquantifiable mental health problems. The extremely psychotic prisoners scream at night, throw feces, and\ngenerally make life miserable for the other inmates and guards. As stated by Dr. Kupers, a psychiatry professor\nand expert for Russell, \"it boils down to warehousing people with severe mental illness ... some are medicated,\nbut there is essentially no other mental health services.\" The mental health care afforded the inmates on Death\nRow is grossly inadequate. The isolation of Death Row, along with the inmates' pending sentences of death and\nthe conditions on Death Row are enough to weaken even the strongest individual. What mental health services\nare provided generally take place at the inmate's cell within hearing of other inmates and guards. This results in\nthe failure of inmates to tell the mental health specialists anything of substance. Moreover, comprehensive mental\nhealth evaluations are consistently inadequate. Inmates are also prescribed psychotropic drugs with only\nsporadic monitoring. This can result in life-threatening situations due to the toxicity of these drugs. Appropriate\ntreatment of mentally ill inmates will in turn help address the issues of excessive noise and sanitation problems\ncaused by severely psychotic inmates. Id. at at *4, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8576 at *11-12.\nExercise\nProper exercise is advantageous for mental health and well-being. The exercise facilities provided are adequate.\nWhile, in general, the use of \"flip-flops\" is understandable as a security measure, such shoes do not allow\neffective exercise. The inmates should be given access to sneakers prior to entering the exercise pen and should\nbe given access to water and shade while exercising. Id. at at *4, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8576 at *12.\n\nThe Trial Court's Conclusions of Law\nThe court concluded that the conditions identified in the court's findings of fact constituted Eighth Amendment\nviolations because they posed a substantial risk of harm to the inmates' health and, based on the obvious nature\nof these risks, the prison officials showed a deliberate indifference to such harm.\nInjunctive Relief Entered by the Trial Court\nThe court directed the following remedial actions.\n1. If defendants wish to continue the practice of moving inmates from cell to cell in Unit 32-C, they\nwill insure that the cell to which an inmate is moved is clean prior to the move. While an inmate\nshould be required to keep his own cell clean, he should not be required to clean the cell of\nanother inmate in order to inhabit it.\n336 2. Adequate cleaning supplies and equipment shall be provided inmates in *336 order that they\nmay clean their cells at least weekly.\n3. A general preventive maintenance schedule and program shall be reduced to writing within 60\ndays of this order.\n4. Defendants shall take the necessary measurements in the unit in order to determine the heat\nindex on the individual tiers. These measurements shall be taken daily at 10:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m.,\n4:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m. during the months of May through September and at 1:00 p.m. in all\nother months. If the heat index reaches 90 degrees or above, the defendants will insure that each\ncell is equipped with a fan, that ice water is available to each inmate, and that each inmate may\ntake one shower during each day when the heat index is 90 degrees or above. As an alternative,\nthe defendants may provide fans, ice water, and daily showers during the months of May through\nSeptember. This remedy shall apply to all of Unit 32.\n5. The defendants shall continue their efforts at mosquito eradication and pest control. The\ndefendants shall also insure that all cell windows are repaired and screened with 18 gauge\nwindow screen or better. This remedy shall apply to all of Unit 32.\n6. The defendants shall insure that the problem of \"ping-pong\" toilets in Unit 32 as a whole is\naddressed. The defendants shall provide to the court within 60 days the details of a plan to\neradicate this problem. The court is not convinced that recalibration is sufficient, but will await the\ndefendants' report on their plan.\n7. The defendants shall also upgrade the lighting in Unit 32 as a whole to provide lighting in each\ncell equal to 20 foot-candles.\n8. The defendants shall insure that the proper chemical agents are used at the laundry so that\ninmates' laundry is returned clean and without a foul smell.\n9. The defendants shall insure that the new vendor for medical services complies with the ACA\nand the National Commission on Correctional Healthcare medical and mental health standards.\nEach inmate on Death Row shall be given a comprehensive mental health examination in private.\nThese comprehensive examinations shall be conducted on a yearly basis. Those inmates\ndiagnosed with psychosis and severe mental health illnesses shall be housed separately and\napart from all other inmates. The medication levels of all inmates receiving psycotropic\nmedications shall be monitored and assessed in accordance with appropriate medical standards.\nAll inmates receiving mental health counseling or evaluation shall meet with the mental health\nprofessionals in a private setting.\n\n10. The inmates on Unit 32-C shall continue to receive the opportunity to exercise as currently\navailable. However, the inmates shall be given the opportunity to wear sneakers while exercising if\nthey prefer rather than \"flip-flops.\" A shaded area for exercise shall be provided with access to\nwater.\n[8]\nRussell v. Johnson, 2003 WL 22208029 at *1-3, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8573 at *1-4 (N.D.Miss.2003).\n337 *337Is the injunctive relief entered by the trial court justified by conditions in violation of the Eighth Amendment's\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment?\nMDOC asserts that, as to several of the injunctions (Injunctions # 2, # 5, # 6, # 7, and # 9), it is already meeting,\nintending to meet, or attempting to meet the standards enunciated by the trial court. Thus, MDOC argues, the\ninjunctions are not required. But MDOC's assertions that it intends to meet these standards do not suffice to moot\nthe issue. It is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a\nfederal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.\nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (citations omitted). If it did, the\ncourts would be compelled to leave \"the defendant... free to return to his old ways.\" Id. In accordance with this\nprinciple, the standard for determining whether a case has been mooted by the defendant's voluntary conduct is\nstringent: \"A case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful\nbehavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" Id. The \"heavy burden of persuading\" the court that the\nchallenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness. Id.\nThe trial court's citation to Friends of the Earth accompanied by its assertion that Russell's claims were not moot\nindicates that the trial court was not persuaded. The fact that many of these conditions have persisted for years\ndespite MDOC's purported efforts leads us to likewise conclude that MDOC has not met the heavy burden of\nshowing that its voluntary conduct has mooted any of the issues presented here.\nSimilarly, MDOC also argues, as to several of the injunctions, that Parchman's accreditation by the American\nCorrectional Association (\"ACA\") is proof that the conditions in question don't violate the Eighth Amendment. But\nit is absurd to suggest that the federal courts should subvert their judgment as to alleged Eighth Amendment\nviolations to the ACA whenever it has relevant standards. Additionally, the ACA's limited inspections are not be\nbinding as factual findings on the magistrate or on this court. While compliance with ACA standards may be a\nrelevant consideration, it is not per se evidence of constitutionality. See Ruiz v. Johnson, 37 F.Supp.2d 855\n924-25 (S.D.Tex.1999) (recognizing the limitations of ACA accreditation and noting situations where it has not\nequated to constitutionality), rev'd on other grounds,178 F.3d 385.\nMDOC finally argues that none of the injunctions are based on Eighth Amendment violations and, thus, that all of\nthe injunctions must be reversed. Using the relevant Eighth Amendment standard, we will examine each of the\ninjunctions in turn.\nInjunctions # 1 and # 2\n338 MDOC argues that the first injunction, which prohibits MDOC from requiring inmates to clean the cells into *338\nwhich they are transferred, cannot stand because there was no proof of any medical injury or illness resulting\nfrom this practice. MDOC similarly maintains that the second injunction, which requires that adequate cleaning\nsupplies be provided to the inmates at least weekly, is unsupported by any evidence of medical illness arising\nfrom this situation or a showing of deliberate indifference by MDOC officials. MDOC also contends that cleaning\nsupplies are regularly issued to inmates and that the cells were clean as of the date of trial.\nThis court has previously held that filthy cell conditions may constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. See \nHarper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 720 (5th Cir.1999). Other circuits have made similar holdings; the Eighth Circuit\nhas held that a prisoner being placed in a cell covered with filth and human waste for a two-year period without\nproper cleaning supplies constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Howard v. Adkison, 887 F.2d 134, 137 (8th\nCir.1989) (recognizing that \"inmates are entitled to reasonably adequate sanitation, personal hygiene, and\n\nlaundry privileges, particularly over a lengthy course of time\"); see also McBride v. Deer, 240 F.3d 1287, 1292\n(10th Cir.2001) (holding that three days in a feces-covered cell states a claim upon which relief could be granted).\nRussell points to testimony adduced at the trial court indicating that the cells were \"extremely filthy\" with crusted\nfecal matter, urine, dried ejaculate, peeling and chipping paint, and old food particles on the walls. Living in such\nconditions would present a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmates, and we cannot say that trial court's\ndecision to credit this testimony was clearly erroneous. Also, in light of substantial testimony indicating that such\nconditions were not atypical and were easily observed, we cannot say that the trial court's conclusion that MDOC\nofficials showed a deliberate indifference to this risk is clearly erroneous. Further, the testimony was conflicting as\nto the frequency and quality of the provision of cleaning supplies, and we cannot say that the trial court's\nconclusion to credit testimony supporting the inadequacy of cleaning supplies was clearly erroneous. As living in\nsuch filthy conditions would present the inmates with a risk of serious harm to which MDOC officials have\ndisplayed a deliberate indifference, Injunctions # 1 and # 2 were justified by an Eighth Amendment violation. They\nare, therefore, affirmed.\nInjunction # 3\nMDOC challenges the third injunction, which directs MDOC to reduce a general preventive maintenance\nschedule and program to writing. MDOC argues that there is no evidence supporting the elements required for a\nfinding of cruel and unusual punishment that would support this injunction. Russell responds that \"[t]he risks of\nsqualid conditions and the constantly recurring break-down of the water, plumbing, and other operating systems\nwere obvious,\" and Russell's environmental health and safety expert testified that the same problems would\ncontinue to recur if MDOC did not put a written plan in place.\nWhile federal courts can certainly enter injunctions to prevent Eighth Amendment violations, they are not to\nmicromanage state prisons. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 562, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The trial\ncourt entered injunctions to directly remedy each of the complained-of conditions that rise to the level of an\nEighth Amendment violation. Russell has cited no case that supports the proposition that the trial court can\n339 further affect the internal operations of MDOC by requiring it to produce a writing preventive maintenance *339\nprogram to which it will adhere. The additional requirement of a written preventive maintenance program, while\ndesirable, is not independently supported by additional conditions that constitute an Eighth Amendment violation,\nand it cannot stand. Thus, we vacate that injunction.\nInjunction # 4\nThe fourth injunction directs MDOC to provide fans, ice water, and daily showers when the heat index is 90\ndegrees or above, or alternatively to make such provisions during the months of May through September. The\ninjunction also purports to apply to all of Unit 32, as opposed to only Unit 32-C. Initially, it is important to note that\nthe class represented by Russell consists entirely of Parchman's Death Row prisoners, who are housed in Unit\n32-C. Thus, to the extent that the injunction purports to apply to parts of Unit 32 beyond Unit 32-C, it exceeds the\nscope of the litigation and is therefore invalid. See Thomas v. County of Los Angeles, 978 F.2d 504, 509-10 (9th\nCir.1992) (reversing an injunction as overbroad when it purported to apply to the entire Los Angeles County\nSheriff's Department although the plaintiff's complaint and evidence only applied to one specific station).\nMDOC contends that no Unit 32-C inmate has ever suffered any serious heat-related illness. But, as noted\nabove, Russell does not need to show that death or serious illness has yet occurred to obtain relief. He must\nshow that the conditions pose a substantial risk of harm to which MDOC officials have shown a deliberate\n[9]\nindifference. Russell presented the court with expert testimony from Dr. Vassallo  that it was \"very likely\" that,\nunder current conditions on Death Row, an inmate will die of heat stroke or some other heat-related illness. In\nfact, Dr. Vassallo's testimony indicated that Death Row prisoners had made many complaints of symptoms\ncommonly recognized to be related to heat-related illness and that those conditions had simply gone\nundiagnosed.\n\nMDOC further cites language from Woods v. Edwards, 51 F.3d 577 (5th Cir.1995), in which Woods, a prisoner at\nthe Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, claimed, inter alia, that the conditions in extended lockdown were\nunconstitutional. Extended lockdown isolates inmates as punishment for disciplinary violations. One of Woods'\nclaims was that the cell used in his extended lockdown was inadequately cooled and that the high temperature\naggravated his sinus condition. Id. at 581. This court noted that Woods \"failed to present medical evidence of any\nsignificance.\" Id. This court went on to state: \"[w]hile the temperature in extended lockdown may be\nuncomfortable, that alone cannot support a finding that the plaintiff was subjected to cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\" Id. The Woods court found that Woods had not presented\nmedical evidence sufficient to state an Eighth Amendment violation; Woods does not stand for the proposition\nthat extreme heat can never constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, MDOC points out that the Seventh\nCircuit has held that one shower a week is sufficient. Davenport v. DeRobertis, 844 F.2d 1310, 1316-17 (7th\n340 Cir.1988). *340 But Davenport is inapt, as it dealt only with cleanliness while the testimony upon which this\ninjunction rests indicated that cold showers would help alleviate the risk of heat-related illness.\nBased on the evidence presented, we cannot say that the trial court's finding that the probability of heat-related\nillness is extreme at Unit 32-C was clearly erroneous. Thus, this condition presents a substantial risk of serious\nharm to the inmates. Again, based on the open and obvious nature of these conditions and the evidence that\ninmates had complained of symptoms of heat-related illness, the trial court's finding regarding MDOC's deliberate\nindifference is not clearly erroneous. Thus, Injunction # 4 was justified by an Eighth Amendment violation, and it\n[10]\nis affirmed insofar as it applies to Unit 32-C.\nInjunction # 5\nThe fifth injunction requires MDOC to continue its efforts at pest control and, more specifically, to ensure that all\ncell windows are repaired and screened with 18 gauge window screen or better. Injunction # 5 purports to apply\nto all of Unit 32. Initially, like Injunction # 4, to the extent that Injunction # 5 purports to apply to parts of Unit 32\nbeyond Unit 32-C, it is invalid.\nMDOC first argues that there is no basis for a federal court to order MDOC to continue to do what it is already\ndoing. But, as discussed above, the pest infestation problems persist, and MDOC has not met the burden of\nconvincing the trial court or this court that its efforts at pest control have mooted this issue. MDOC also argues\nthat the evidence shows that there were no holes in the screens at the time of trial. But the trial court was\npresented with testimony that there were cells with holes in the screens, and, in any event, the insufficient gauge\non the screens would allow the infestation problem to continue even in absence of holes in the screens.\nMDOC argues generally that Russell did not show either a substantial risk of harm to the inmates or deliberate\nindifference on the part of MDOC officials. But the trial court was presented with testimony that insects swarm in\nthe inmates' food and beds and that the inmates often must choose between opening the window for relief from\nthe heat or closing the window for protection from mosquitoes, as the gauge on the screens is too large to keep\nout the mosquitoes. It is important to recognize that this injunction is supported by the trial court's findings on\nheat, as the court noted that the mosquito infestation accompanied by the insufficient screen gauge exacerbated\nthe heat problems by deterring the inmates from opening their windows to increase circulation. In addition to the\nrisk of heat-related illness, the pest infestation problems were linked to chronic sleep deprivation, which\nexacerbates the symptoms of mental illness. As Injunction # 5, like Injunction # 4, is supported by the\nconstitutional violation stemming from the excessive heat, it is affirmed as to Unit 32-C.\nInjunction # 6\n341 The sixth injunction requires MDOC to remedy the problem of \"ping-pong\" *341 toilets. Like Injunctions # 4 and #\n5, this injunction is invalid to the extent it purports to apply to parts of Unit 32 outside of Unit 32-C.\nMDOC argues that there is no evidence of any serious medical problem stemming from the ping-pong toilets and,\nfurther, that in absence of objective evidence of such a problem there can be no finding of deliberate indifference\n\non the part of MDOC officials. MDOC cites Tokar v. Armontrout, 97 F.3d 1078 (8th Cir.1996), for the proposition\nthat exposure to raw sewage is not cruel and unusual punishment where there has been no demonstration of an\nadverse medical reaction. But MDOC seriously misconstrues Tokar. Tokar complained generally that the prison\ntoilets were \"filthy\" without specifying how long the toilets remained filthy and while acknowledging that he had\nnot asked for cleaning supplies because cleaning the toilets was the job of other inmates. Id. at 1081. The facts\nof Tokar are quite different from the facts presented here, in which inmates have regularly been exposed to each\nothers' feces for over a decade. In fact, the Eighth Circuit's recognitions that exposure to waste may constitute\ncruel and unusual punishment and that the length of time a prisoner must endure unsanitary conditions is\nundoubtedly a factor in the constitutional calculus, id. at 1082 n. 4, both weigh in Russell's favor. While evidence\nof a past medical injury would clearly strengthen Russell's case, Russell does not have to prove a past medical\ninjury. He must prove a substantial risk of serious harm and MDOC officials' deliberate indifference to that harm.\nRussell points to expert testimony stating that the situation presented when the feces of one inmate bubbles up in\nthe neighboring cell, exacerbated when the toilets overflow, does constitute a serious health hazard. Russell also\npresented evidence to the trial court that the Mississippi State Department of Health warned MDOC every year\nfor the past eleven years that the malfunctioning toilets in Unit 32-C are a critical public health problem requiring\nimmediate attention. Additionally, Russell points to several circuit court cases indicating that \"courts have been\nespecially cautious about condoning conditions involving exposure to human waste.\" Fruit v. Norris, 905 F.2d\n1147, 1151 (8th Cir.1990); see also, e.g., DeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 974 (10th Cir.2001)(exposure to\nhuman waste \"evokes both the health concerns emphasized in Farmer and the more general standards of dignity\nembodied in the Eighth Amendment\").\nMDOC also asserts that there was substantial testimony regarding its attempts to correct the toilet problem,\npresumably arguing that this further rebuts a finding of deliberate indifference. As evidence of deliberate\nindifference, Russell points to the fact that the problems persist despite MDOC officials having been warned that\nthe problem was urgent for more than a decade. Frequent exposure to the waste of other persons can certainly\npresent health hazards that constitute a serious risk of substantial harm. Given the evidence presented to the trial\ncourt, we cannot say that the court's factual findings regarding the ping-pong toilets or the MDOC officials'\ndeliberate indifference were clearly erroneous. Thus, this injunction, as applied to Unit 32-C, is affirmed.\nInjunction # 7\nThis injunction requires MDOC to upgrade the lighting in each cell to the level of twenty foot-candles. This\ninjunction also purports to apply to Unit 32 as a whole and is invalid insofar as it purports to apply beyond Unit\n342 32-C. MDOC argues that the injunction is wholly invalid because MDOC officials were in the process *342 of\nupgrading cell lighting. As with the sanitation issues, the pest control issues, and the ping-pong toilets, MDOC's\nassertions that it is working on the problem are inadequate to moot the issue. MDOC also argues that there was\nno evidence of a substantial risk of serious harm stemming from the admittedly inadequate lighting or of MDOC\nofficials' deliberate indifference to such harm. But the trial court judge apparently credited expert testimony\nasserting that the lighting in the cells was grossly inadequate for the purposes of sanitation, personal hygiene,\nand reading, that this condition also contributes to further mental health deterioration, and that twenty foot-\ncandles was the appropriate minimum level at which these activities could take place. Thus, this injunction is\nsupported by the conditions supporting Injunctions # 1, # 2, and # 9, discussed below, and it is affirmed.\nInjunction # 8\nThe eighth injunction requires MDOC to return the inmates' laundry clean and without a foul smell. MDOC argues\nthat the prison laundry condition is not sufficiently serious to implicate the Eighth Amendment, citing Green v.\nFerrell, 801 F.2d 765, 771 (5th Cir.1986), and similarly that there was no proof of any serious medical harm to any\ninmate stemming from this condition. The Green court reiterated that \"jails must provide `reasonably adequate'\nsanitation\" but overturned the district court's injunction requiring the jail to provide laundry services because the\nprisoners were provided with laundry detergent that they could use to wash their own clothes in the sink located\nin their cells. Id.\n\nRussell points to testimonial evidence that, unlike the situation in Green, the Death Row inmates are not provided\nwith detergent and in fact can be disciplined for doing their own laundry. First, the trial court found that the\ninmates do in fact wash their own clothes, as conceded by one of MDOC's witnesses, who testified that the\ninmates wash their own clothes because it is part of \"prison culture.\" This finding was supported by substantial\nevidence and is incongruous with the proposition that inmates are disciplined for washing their own clothes.\nGiven that the inmates do wash their own clothes, the only distinction between this case and Green is that the\nprisoners in Green were provided with laundry detergent while the Death Row inmates in this case wash their\nclothes with the bar soap. The difference between laundry detergent and bar soap is not sufficient to distinguish\nthis case from Green and thus does not implicate the Eighth Amendment. Injunction # 8 is therefore vacated.\nInjunction # 9\nThe ninth injunction outlines a number of requirements designed to alleviate some of the problems stemming\nfrom the allegedly inadequate mental health care afforded the inmates on Death Row. This injunction requires\nMDOC to comply with ACA and National Commission on Correctional Healthcare (\"NCCH\") standards regarding\nmental health, to give each inmate private, comprehensive mental health examinations on a yearly basis, to\nmonitor and assess the medication levels of inmates receiving psychotropic medications, and to house the\ninmates with psychosis and severe mental illnesses separately from the other inmates.\nMDOC argues that it was already in compliance with ACA standards and, somewhat contradictorily, that MDOC\nhas already begun the process of selecting a new medical vendor that would comply with ACA and NCCH\n343 standards. Once again, MDOC's assertion that it was already on the path towards compliance is *343 insufficient\nto moot the issue. Further, the injunction does not require only ACA compliance. In any event, MDOC's assertion\nthat it is already in compliance with ACA and NCCH standards is incongruous with the trial court's findings,\nincluding the statement that \"the mental health care afforded the inmates on Death Row is grossly inadequate.\"\nThese findings were based on substantial testimony adduced at trial and apparently credited by the trial court.\nFor example, Russell produced evidence that the isolation and idleness of Death Row combined with the squalor,\npoor hygiene, temperature, and noise of extremely psychotic prisoners create an environment \"toxic\" to the\nprisoners' mental health. There was also evidence that the severely psychotic prisoners smear garbage and\nexcrement in their cells, scream all night, and flood the tiers. This contributes to the problems of uncleanliness\nand sleep deprivation, and by extension mental health problems, for the other inmates. There was also testimony\nthat prisoners seldom see medical staff and that monitoring of medication was sporadic, with prisoners potentially\nbeing prescribed the wrong medication or no medication for long periods of time, potentially leading to extremely\ndangerous physical side effects or psychotic breakdowns.\nMDOC also points out that two inmates have refused psychiatric medication so as to remain incompetent for\nexecution. But this does not refute the trial court's findings that the mental health care afforded to inmates on\nDeath Row is grossly inadequate. MDOC is only obligated to make adequate mental health care available for all\nDeath Row inmates. The fact that some inmates may refuse to take advantage of such treatment so as to avoid\nexecution is irrelevant to whether MDOC is meeting its obligation of complying with constitutional standards.\nMDOC further argues that there was no demonstration of deliberate indifference to any serious mental or medical\nproblem stemming from insufficient mental health care. In analyzing this argument, it is important to remember\nthat mental health needs are no less serious than physical needs. Partridge v. Two Unknown Police Officers of\nCity of Houston, Texas, 791 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir.1986). This court has previously held that an inmate stated\na nonfrivolous claim in complaining that he was placed in cells next to psychiatric patients who scream, beat on\nmetal toilets, short out the power, flood the cells, throw feces, and light fires, resulting in his loss of sleep for days\nat a time. Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 720 (5th Cir.1999). The trial court's findings indicate that the inmates\nare subjected to substantial risk of serious harm based on the mental health conditions on Death Row, and,\nbased on the evidence presented to the trial court, we cannot conclude that the court's credibility determinations\nand factual findings are clearly erroneous. We agree that the conditions of inadequate mental health care, as\nfound by the trial court, do present a risk of serious harm to the inmates mental and physical health. Again, the\nobvious and pervasive nature of these conditions supports the trial court's conclusion that MDOC officials\n\ndisplayed a deliberate indifference to these conditions. Thus, this injunction was justified by an Eighth\nAmendment violation and is affirmed.\nInjunction # 10\nThe tenth injunction requires MDOC to allow the inmates to wear sneakers instead of flip-flops while exercising\nand to provide the inmates with a shaded area for exercise and access to water. MDOC argues that this is\n344 impermissible micromanagement of state prison operations *344 and that no evidence was presented\nestablishing a constitutional violation. The evidence shows that inmates are allowed an hour of exercise four or\nfive days a week. The evidence also shows that shoes and boots were replaced with flip flops because the\ninmates used the boots and shoes to kick other inmates and to throw at MDOC staff, and because the flip flops\nmake escape more difficult. In fact, the trial court stated that it understood \"the use of `flip-flops' as general\nfootwear as a security measure.\"\nRussell argues that the flip-flops make it difficult or impossible to exercise vigorously. But there is no support for\nthe proposition that exercising in flip-flops constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Nor is there any support for\nthe proposition that an hour of outdoor exercise without water or shade constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment. While exercise is certainly beneficial to physical and mental health, we find that the provisions for\nexercise made by MDOC are appropriate and that the tenth injunction is not justified by conditions in violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment. Thus, the tenth injunction is vacated.\nCONCLUSION\nInjunctions # 3, 8, and 10 are vacated in their entirety. Injunctions # 4, 5, 6, and 7 are vacated to the extent they\npurport to apply to portions of Unit 32 beyond Unit 32-C. The remainder of the injunctive relief is AFFIRMED.\n[1] Russell filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that this court was without jurisdiction because the order\nfrom which MDOC appeals was inherently tentative. We disagree. In addition to having jurisdiction to review final\ndecisions of district courts, 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court has jurisdiction to review interlocutory decisions\n\"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). The order from which\nMDOC appeals is the \"Final Judgment\" issued on May 21, 2003. That order imposes ten detailed injunctive\nrequirements on MDOC. As Russell points out, the order also requires MDOC to report its \"progress in meeting\nthe remedial actions\" on July 7. The requirement of a progress report does not change the fact that the May 21st\norder grants injunctions against Mississippi requiring immediate action. In fact, this court granted MDOC a stay of\nthis injunctive order to relieve MDOC from the burden of compliance pending appeal. In short, the May 21st order\nqualifies as an order granting an injunction; thus, this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1),\nand Russell's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is denied.\n[2] As mentioned in Footnote 1, this court previously granted MDOC's motion for a stay of the injunctive relief\npending appeal. On March 31, 2004, Russell filed a motion to lift that stay. Due to the filing of this opinion, the\nstay pending appeal is vacated and Russell's motion to lift the stay is denied as moot.\n[3] The ARP rules indicate that the letter should state that it is a request for an administrative remedy and should\npresent as many facts as possible.\n[4] Although no part of the ARP rules provide for a certificate of completion, MDOC asserts that the inmate\nreceives a certificate of completion upon finishing the ARP. Under the prior version of section 1997e, before its\namendment in 1996, the administrative remedy was required to be certified. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)(2)(1994)\n(amended 1996). The 1994 district court order certifying the ARP under the prior version of the statute required\ninmates to complete the procedure and to attach a certificate to that effect to their complaint.\n[5] MDOC argues that the emergency request procedure only provides a mechanism for temporary relief and\ndoes not excuse an inmate from pursuing relief through the three-step ARP process. Thus, MDOC maintains that\n\nRussell did not exhaust administrative remedies because, in addition to utilizing the emergency relief process, he\ndid not complete the three-step process culminating in a certificate of completion. \nBut MDOC's contention is simply not supported by the language of the policy outlining the ARP process. The\nportion of that policy detailing the procedure for emergency relief requests does not indicate that the inmate must\nsimultaneously proceed through the three-step process. In fact, it refers to the regular grievance process only as\nan alternative when an emergency request has been deemed to be a non-emergency. MDOC never rejected the\nemergency request nor advised Russell to resubmit it as a regular grievance. The policy does not indicate that\nthe emergency request procedure is simply designed to provide stop-gap measures while the request proceeds\nthrough the normal administrative procedures. The most natural reading of the policy leads to the conclusion that\nthe emergency request procedure simply expedites the administrative process by allowing the request to be\nreviewed at the Commissioner's level without having to proceed through the entire three-step process in limited\ncircumstances.\n[6] Although the form was submitted directly to Commissioner Johnson instead of being sent through the Legal\nAdjudicator, MDOC never rejected the request for technical reasons or for matters of form. To the contrary, as\ndiscussed below, MDOC addressed the substance of Russell's request, albeit with some delay. As MDOC\nignored this technical defect but instead addressed Russell's request at the administrative level and denied it for\nmatters of substance, it cannot now claim that Russell failed to exhaust based on this technical defect. Cf. \nWendell v. Asher, 162 F.3d 887, 890 (5th Cir.1998) (stating that the exhaustion requirement imposed by the PLRA\nis subject to the defenses of waiver and estoppel).\n[7] A foot-candle is \"[a] unit of measure of the intensity of light falling on a surface, equal to one lumens per\nsquare foot and originally defined with reference to a standardized candle burning at one foot from a given\nsurface.\" THE AMERICAN HERITAGE COLLEGE DICTIONARY 530 (3rd ed.1993).\n[8] MDOC makes a cursory argument that the injunctions must be reversed because the trial court failed to make\nparticularized findings required by the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a). There are multiple problems with this\nargument. The first is that MDOC never presented this argument to the trial court. This court does not generally\nreview issues raised for the first time on appeal. See, e.g., Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). \nAdditionally, MDOC citesCastillo v. CameronCounty, 238 F.3d 339, 351 (5th Cir.2001), for the proposition that a\ncourt must make particularized findings, on a provision-by-provision basis, that each injunction is narrowly drawn,\ngoes no further than necessary to correct the violation, and is the least intrusive means of correcting the violation.\nBut MDOC's reliance on Castillo is misplaced. Castillo requires such findings to be made when the district court\nholds that prior injunctive relief should not be terminated, relying on section 3262(b)(3). Id. at 351-54. Section\n3262(b)(3) on its face requires such written findings. Conversely, section 3262(a)(1), which applies to prospective\nrelief and is thus applicable here, does not.\n[9] Dr. Vassallo is a faculty member of the Department of Surgery and Division of Emergency Medicine at New\nYork University School of Medicine and is a medical toxicologist at the New York Regional Poison Control Center.\nShe has lectured extensively on thermoregulation and hyperthermia (heat illness) and has authored the\n\"Thermoregulatory Principles\" chapter of Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies, a textbook on medical toxicology.\n[10] In a footnote in its brief, MDOC asserts that the extra showers ordered by the trial court would cause a major\nprison security problem. Russell replies that no such evidence was presented at trial and, thus, that the trial court\nshould be given the first opportunity to rule on this issue. In their reply brief, MDOC admits that such evidence\nwas only presented to the court as part of MDOC's July 2003 progress report. But only the May 21, 2003, final\norder of the trial court is currently under review, not any subsequent monitoring of the trial court's injunctive relief.\nThis issue is thus not before us.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

CIVIL  NO.  1:02CV261-JAD \nROBERT  L.  JOHNSON,  ET  AL  DEFENDANTS \nORDER  AWARDING  ATTORNEYS'  FEES  AND  EXPENSES \nBefore the court are plaintiffs'  motion and renewed motion for \nattorneys'  fees and expenses in this litigation.  Having considered \nplaintiffs'  attorneys'  filings  and  defendants'  obj ections,  the \ncourt  is prepared  to  rule. \nBackground \nThis request  for fees and expenses  is based on the findings of \nthis court of certain constitutional violations  in the housing and \ntreatment  of  death row  inmates  at  Parchman.  The  court  entered its \nFinal  Judgment  and  Memorandum  Opinion  on  May  21,  2003.  The  court \nwill  not  reiterate  all  of  its  prior  findings  here.  The  Fifth \nCircuit  Court  of  Appeals  issued  an  opinion  on  June  28,  2004, \nvacating three of the injunctions issued by this court and limiting \nthe  injunctive  relief  in  four  other  instances  to  Unit  32-C  (Death \nRow)  rather  than  the  whole  of  Unit  32.  For  those  reasons \ndefendants  argue  that  plaintiffs'  request  for  fees  and  expenses \nshould be significantly reduced.  The court disagrees with the term \n\"significantly./I \n-1-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 75     Filed 02/04/2005     Page 2 of 5\nAttorneys'  Fees  Under  the \nPrison Litigation Refor.m  Act  (PLRA) \nThe  PLRA  authorizes  attorneys  fees  under  certain  prescribed \ncircumstances.  42  USC  §1997e(d)  provides: \nIn any action brought  by a  prisoner who  is confined \nto any to any jail, prison or other correctional facility \nin  which  attorney's  fees  are  authorized  under  section \n1988  of  this  title  shall  not  be  awarded,  except  to  the \nextent  that  - -\n(A)  the  fee  was  directly  and  reasonably \nincurred in proving an actual violation of  the \nplaintiff's  rights  protected  by  a  statute \npursuant  to  which  a  fee  may  be  awarded  under \nSection  1988  of  this  title;  and  (B)  (i)  the \namount  of  the  fee  is  proportionately  related \nto the court ordered relief for the violation; \nor  (ii)  the  fee  was  directly  and  reasonably \nincurred  in  enforcing  the  relief  ordered  for \nthe  violations. \nUnquestionably,  the  plaintiffs  incurred  fees  and  expenses  in \nproving actual violations of  the  rights of death row  inmates.  The \nquestion  for  the  court  is  what  amount  of  the  fee  request  is \n\"proportionately related  to  the  court-ordered  relief.\" \nFirst,  the  hourly  fee  is  limited  to  150%  of  the  hourly  fee \npaid to Criminal  Justice Act  attorneys.  The  current  hourly fee  in \nthis  district  is  $90  per  hour  for  both  in-court  and  out-of-court \nwork.  Accordingly,  the  maximum  allowable  rate  is  $135  per  hour \nunder  the  PLRA.  The  court  finds  that  the  hourly  rate  for  each \nattorney  and  paralegal  representing  the  plaintiffs  should  be  as \nfollows: \n1.  Margaret  Winter  $135/hour \n2.  Stephen Hanlon  $135/hour \n-2-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 75     Filed 02/04/2005     Page 3 of 5\n3.  Esme  Caramello  $125/hour \n4.  Amy  Fettig  $120/hour \n5.  Sandi  Farrell  $120/hour \n6.  Terrance  Moore  $60/hour \nTurning  to  the  hours  expended  by  each  attorney and  paralegal \nin  this  case,  the  court  finds  that  all  the  theories  in  this  case \nderived  from  a  common  core  of  operative  facts  and  that  the  minor \nrelief  granted  on  the  appeal  does  not  justify a  reduction  of  the \nhours expended by counsel  in this case.  See,  Hensley v.  Eckerhart, \n461  U.S.  424,  429  (1983).  The  court  also  rejects  the  defendants' \narguments  for  reduction  except  where  agreed  by  plaintiffs.  The \ncourt  finds  that  the  hours  spent  on  the  trial of  this case  and  the \nappeal  were  completely  reasonable,  especially  considering  the \nresults.  Therefore,  the  court  finds  that  following  hours \nreasonably  expended  in  this  litigation  for  each  attorney  and \nparalegal: \n1.  Margaret  Winter  Trial  - 596.7  hours \nAppeal- 240.0  hours \n2.  Stephen  Hanlon  Trial  - 77.9  hours \n3.  Esme  Caramello  Trial  - 88.0  hours \n4.  Amy  Fettig  Trial  - 283.4  hours \n5.  Sandi  Farrell  Trial  - 77.0  hours \n6.  Terrance  Moore  Trial  - 24.0  hours \nHaving  determined the hourly rate and  reasonable hours  expended  in \n-3-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 75     Filed 02/04/2005     Page 4 of 5\nthis  litigation,  the  court  determines  the  lodestar fee  as  follows: \nl.  Margaret  Winter  $135  x  596.7  $80,554.50 \n(Appeal)  $135  x  240.0  =  $32,400.00 \n2.  Stephen  Hanlon  $135  x  77.9  =  $10,516.50 \n3 .  Esme  Caramello  $125  x  88.0  =  $11,000.00 \n4.  Amy  Fettig  $120  x  283.4  =  $34,008.00 \n5 .  Sandi  Farrell  $120  x  77.0  =  $  9,240.00 \n6.  Terrance  Moore  $60  x  24.0  $  1,440.00 \nTOTAL  FEE  $179,149.00 \nWhile  the court  is aware  that senior attorneys  like Ms.  Winter \nand Mr.  Hanlon have  been awarded  fees  in this district of  $150/hr. \nfor civil rights violations,  the court  is constrained by the limits \nof  the  PLRA.  Moreover,  under  the  circumstances,  no  adjustment  to \nthe  lodestar  pursuant  to  Johnson v.  Georgia  Highway  Express,  488 \nF.2d  714  (5th  Cir.  1974)  is  appropriate  although  the  court \nrecognizes that plaintiffs'  attorneys achieved a  great result in an \nundesirable  case.  The  court  finds  that  the  hours  approved because \nof  the  common  core  of  facts  adequately  recognizes  the  results \nobtained. \nFinally,  the  court  finds  the  expenses  claimed  by  plaintiffs \n(except  for  the  inadvertent  claim  of  $78  for  toiletries  and \nclothing by Ms.  Fettig on  February  9,  2003)  should be  approved  in \ntheir  entirety.  Defendants'  objections  are  without  merit.  The \nexpenses  approved  are  as  follows: \n-4-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 75     Filed 02/04/2005     Page 5 of 5\n1.

ACLU  of  Mississippi  $  1,484.38 \nTOTAL  EXPENSES  $42,984.98 \nIn summary,  the  court  awards  the  total  amount  of  $146,749  for \nattorneys'  fees  and  $40,607.59  for  expenses  for  the  trial  of  this \ncase.  The  court  awards  $32,400  for  attorneys'  fees  and  $2,377.39 \nfor  expense  in  the  appeal  of  this  case.

      "text": "I'  Case 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 1 of 8(cid:10)\nF I LED \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI \nEASTERN DIVISION \nWILLIE RUSSELL, ET AL \nPLAINTIFFS \nVS  Case No. 1:02CV261-D-D \nROBERT L. JOHNSON, ET AL  DEFENDANTS \nREBUTTAL DECLARATION OF STEPHEN F. HANLON REGARDING \nPLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES \nStephen F. Hanlon, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, makes the following rebuttal \ndeclaration in support of Plaintiffs' motion for Attorneys Fees and Expenses herein and in \nopposition to the State Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition thereto: \n1.  I previously filed a Declaration in this case in support of Plaintiffs' motion for \naward of attorneys fees and expenses, dated July 17, 2003. \n2.  I have reviewed the State defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' \nMotion for Attorneys Fees and Expenses and submit this rebuttal declaration. \n3.  I have represented many prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights litigation in the federal \ndistrict courts of this country for the past 25 years.  During that period of time, I have routinely \nsought and obtained compensation by the district courts of this country for time expended on \nattorneys fee applications.  The Fifth Circuit has squarely held that \" ... fees-on-fees are 'directly \nand reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation ofplaintiffs rights and therefore \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 2 of 8(cid:10)\nrecoverable under section 1997e(d).\" Yolk v. Gonzalez, 262 F.3d, 528, 535 (5th Cir. 2001).  In \nthis particular case, remarkably little work (approximately 27.3 hours) is being submitted for \ntime spent in preparation of the fee application, given the complexity of the work involved. \n4.  With respect to Defendants' complaint that several of our time entries in the time \nsubmitted in Plaintiffs' motion for attorneys fees and expenses in this case are lumped or \nbunched, as suggested by the Court in ACLU v. Barnes, 168 F. 3d, 423, 429 (11 Cir. 1999), I \nhave reviewed our time records, our notes, the case file and correspondence and state that the \nfollowing times are good faith estimates for the following time entries: \nStephen F. Hanlon \n7/11/02  Confer with Winter and McDuff regarding same  .5 \n7/16/02 .  Confer with Winter regarding same  .3 \n8/13102  Review memo regarding same  .5 \n10122/02  Conference call hearing  .4 \n2102/03  Conference with J. Balsamo  1.0 \n2/03/03  Conference with P.

Caramello \n2/10103  Prepare trial documents for trip to Mississippi  1.0 \nTravel to Clarksdale, Mississippi  6.0 \nBalance of time for trial preparation as described in  5.0 \ntime entry \n2/11/03  Participate in tour of Unit 32-C, Parchman Death Row,  7.0 \nincluding interviews with inmates to determine \nwhether and to what extent conditions had changed \n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 3 of 8(cid:10)\nBalance of time in trial preparation as described  7.2 \n2/12/03  Entire time spent in trial preparation as described  14.5 \ntherein \n2/13/03  Entire time spent in trial preparation as described  14.5 \ntherein \n2114/03  Prepare additional exhibits and papers for trial  2.0 \n5.  In my 25 years of work in representing prevailing parties in attorneys fees \npetitions in civil rights cases, I have occasionally faced the claim by the losing party's lawyer \nthat the plaintiffs fees should be reduced because the plaintiff achieved only a partial or limited \nsuccess with regard to the relief sought in the suit.  A cursory examination of Unit 32-C before \nthe institution of this lawsuit and after the conclusion of this lawsuit would immediately reveal \nthat the plaintiffs achieved overwhelming success in this case and that this case is uniquely \nunsuited to the narrowly crafted partial success limitation on claims for civil rights attorneys \nfees .. \n6.  In the Fifth Circuit's opinion in this case, the plaintiffs prevailed on seven ofthe \nten injunctions scrutinized by the Fifth Circuit, including all of the major claims in this case. \nPlaintiffs did not prevail on three unquestionably minor injunctions:  (1) reducing the general \npreventive maintenance schedule and program to writing; (2) returning inmates' clothing without \nfoul smell; and (3) requiring the inmates to wear sneakers instead of flip flops while exercising \nand providing inmates with a shaded area for exercise and access to water.  Hensley v. \nEckerhard, 461 U.S. 424 (1983) sets out the \"proper method of calculating attorneys' fees when \nthe plaintiff prevailed on less than all claims.\"  Id.  Under Hensley \"[w] here all theories derived \nfrom a common core of operative facts, the focus should be on the significance of overall results \nas a function of total reasonable hours ... [and] [i] it is improper to make the reduction based on \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 4 of 8(cid:10)\na simple ratio of successful issues to issues raised.\"  In this case, all theories derived from a \ncommon core of operative facts and therefore the Court's focus should be on the significance of \nthe overall results, and it would be improper to make a reduction based on a simple ratio of \nsuccessful issues raised.  The simple fact of the matter is that this Court found pervasive Eighth \nAmendment violations in Unit 32-C, and all of the major injunctive relief ordered by this Court \nwas upheld on appeal.  The Rendon case cited by State Defendants to support its partial success \nargument here is wholly inapposite.  In that case, the court reduced a fee award where \"counsel \nhad expended considerable time and effort on plaintiffs' (unsuccessful) claims of discriminatory \nhiring and termination practices.\" As this Court knows, that was hardly the case on the three \nminor unsuccessful claims in this case. \n7.  The issues involved in the trial and Fifth Circuit appeal in this case are some of \nthe most complex issues in any litigation in which I have been involved in my 38 years of \npracticing law.  I cannot imagine Ms. Winter working on the brief and preparing for the oral \nargument in less time than she did here (124.50 hours and 49.60 hours respectively).  In point of \nfact, three lawyers from my law firm and myself read the briefs and conducted a moot court for \nMs. Winter in preparation for oral argument, and none of that time is being submitted in this fee \npetition.  All of the work Ms. Winter did on the post trial brief, as well as the work that Ms. \nFettig did on the post-trial brief, as well as all of the work by Chesterfield Smith Fellow Heather \nCaramello, was absolutely essential.  It is remarkable that Ms. Winter was able to draft the \ncomplaint in under 20 hours.  The five and a half hours that Ms. Winter spent drafting a memo to \nthe Commissioner was the foundation for this Court's and the Fifth Circuit's finding that \nplaintiffs have exhausted administrative remedies in this case.  A cursory review of the Fifth \nCircuit's opinion reveals just how important this document was in that court's extensive analysis \n-4-\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 5 of 8(cid:10)\nof the exhaustion issue.  The time spent by Ms. Fettig in writing affidavits in this case was \nabsolutely essential to the preliminary injunctive relief initially sought in this case.  The same is \ntrue ofthe 15.6 hours that Ms. Fettig spent reviewing Mr. Russell's file. \n8.  In my 38 years of practicing law, I have never seen a more efficiently prepared \nand tried case.  Each attorney had distinct responsibilities and made distinct contributions to the \nresult in this case.  This case was managed with remarkable efficiency.  Not a single deposition \nwas taken.  This is the leanest case, in terms of the time spent by the attorneys, that I have ever \nparticipated in, especially considering of the complexity of the issues and the importance of the \ncase to the clients. \n9.  The capped PLRA rates that we are seeking for Ms. Winter and myself in this \ncase, namely $169.50 per hour, are 50 cents an hour less than the rates that Holland & Knight \nroutinely bills for first year associates in our Atlanta office.  Given Ms. Winters' years of \nexperience and her degree of expertise, a lawyer with similar experience and expertise in the \nHolland & Knight offices in Washington, D.C. would be billed out to paying clients at a rate of \n$400 an hour.  My current rate for paying clients is $440 per hour.  Thus, the limitations imposed \nby the Prison Litigation Reform Act upon the rates that this Court can award Plaintiffs will result \nin an enormous windfall for the Defendants. \n10.  With respect to the August 6, 2002 expense of $5, 352.59 which we have \nsubmitted for Plaintiffs' environmental expert James J. Balsamo, Jr.'s expenses for an inspection \ntour of Parchman and facility in Mississippi, we are hereby withdrawing $5,000 of that amount, \nwhich was for expert fees and not expenses, and was inadvertently included in the expenses \nsubmitted for reimbursement.  Otherwise, I believe the total expert expenses submitted for \nreimbursement, once this $5,000 is retracted, is $8,802, which would cover four experts, each \n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 6 of 8(cid:10)\nmaking two trips to Mississippi, which is a little more than $1100 per trip, which seems entirely \nreasonable to me. \n11.  With respect to the matter of appropriateness of reimbursement of Plaintiffs' \nlitigation expenses, the law could not be clearer.  See Dowdell v. City of Apopka, 698 F.2d 1181, \n1192 (11 th Cir. 1983): \n•  (\"[A]ll reasonable expenses incurred in case preparation, during the course of \nlitigation, or as an aspect of settlement of the case may be taxed as costs under \nsection 1988.\".  Id. at 1192. \n•  \"As is true in other applications of section 1988, the standard of reasonableness is \nto be given a liberal interpretation\" (citing Gates v. Collier, 616 F.2d at 1275).  Id. \nat 1192. \n•  \"We reject any interpretation of 'reasonable costs' which would penalize \nattorneys for undertaking civil rights litigation.\" Id. at 1191. \n•  \"Litigation costs are likely to escalate with inflation and the increasing \nelaboration of civil rights law.  They must not be allowed to whittle away at the \nfees ofthe civil right lawyer.\" Id. at 119l. \n•  \"We hold that, with the exception of routine office overhead normally absorbed \nby the practicing attorney, all reasonable expenses incurred in case preparation, \nduring the course of the litigation, or as an aspect of settlement of the case, may \nbe taxed as costs under section 1988.\" Id. at 1192. \n•  \"Civil rights litigants may not be charged with selecting the nearest and cheapest \nattorney.  Neither may civil rights attorneys be charged with being financial \nefficiency experts.\"  Id. at 1192. \n-6 -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 7 of 8(cid:10)\n•  \"Travel, telephone and postage expenses are not unusual.  All of them have been \nawarded in the decisions ofthe courts of this circuit.\"  Id. at 1192. \n12.  The rationale for an expansive interpretation of § 1988 to include the recovery of \nout-of-pocket litigation expenses that are not a part of ordinary office overhead was well stated \nby Judge Posner in Henry v. Webermeier: \nThe Act [section 1988] seeks to shift the cost ofthe winning party's \nlawyer (in cases within the intended scope of the Act) to the losing party; \nand that cost includes the out-of-pocket expenses for which lawyers \nnormally bill their clients separately, as well as fees for lawyer effort.  The \nAct would therefore fall short of its goal if it excluded those expenses. \nWhat is more, the line between fees and expenses is arbitrary.  A lawyer's \nhourly billing rate includes many overhead expenses such as local \ntelephone calls.  It is impossible to believe that Congress would have \nwanted prevailing parties to get back their lawyers' local telephone \nexpenses (invariably included in the hourly fee) but not their long-distance \nexpenses (invariably billed separately); or to get back their secretarial \nexpenses - which are included in the overhead and therefore billed as part \nof the lawyer's hourly rate rather than separately - but not the expenses of \nword processing, often billed separately to the client. \n738 F. 2d 188, 192 (ih Cir. 1984). \n13.  Each ofthe expenses for which Plaintiffs seek recovery was directly incurred in \nfurtherance of this lawsuit and is of the type that is routinely incurred by counsel in representing \ntheir clients. \n14.  Travel time between the location of counsel and the litigation site is fully \nrecoverable.  As Judge Posner has explained, \"lawyers invariably charge their clients for travel \ntime\" because \"when a lawyer travels for one client he incurs an opportunity cost that is equal to \nthe fee he would have charged that or another client ifhe had not been traveling.\" Henry v. \nWebermeier, 930 F. Supp. 1492 (M.D. Ala. 1996); Hall v. Lowder, 263 F. Supp. 2d 1352 (M.D. \nAla. 2003). \n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 74     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 8 of 8(cid:10)\n15.  The Defendants' argument that the Plaintiffs are seeking compensation for \nexcessive or otherwise unnecessary hours is perhaps best analyzed using a test set out by Judge \nForrester in the seminal attorneys' fees case in the Eleventh Circuit, Norman v. Housing \nAuthority ofthe City of Montgomery, 836. F.2d 1292 (1988).  A lawyer should not be \ncompensated for \"hours spent on activities for which he would not bill a client of means who \nwas seriously intent on vindicating similar rights.  (ld. at 1301.) In the private practice of law, \nwe frequently encounter a client of means seriously intent on vindicating similar rights.  We call \nthese cases \"bet the company\" cases.  This case was a \"bet the company\" case for our clients. \nThe appalling conditions to which they were being subjected prior to the institution ofthis law \nsuit provided that the factual predicate for a claim in which they had an enormous stake.  With \nthe minor adjustments made in this fees claim by the Declarations of myself and Ms. Winter \nsubmitted herewith, the Court can be assured that we are seeking compensation in this case only \nfor hours spent on activities which a lawyer in the private practice would bill to a client of means \nwho was seriously intent on vindicating similar rights. \nI DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE FOREGOING IS TRUE \nAND CORRECT.  EXECUTED ON THIS  ,2004. \n- 8 -",

The trip \nin question was my March 12, 2002 trip to Jackson to meet with Commissioner Robert L. Johnson \nand Deputy Commissioner Christopher Epps and their lawyers, in an effort to resolve Plaintiffs' \ncomplaints without litigation. I could not possibly have delegated to a secretary or paralegal the task \nof planning the trip logistics. I had to coordinate my travel plans with co-counsel Stephen Hanlon \nand local counsel Robert McDuff, and I could only do this by communicating directly with them, \nnot through an intermediary. Mr. Hanlon and I had to travel on different flights, and we had to find \na narrow window of time to allow us time to confer together with Mr. McDuff before our meeting \nwith the Commissioner.  Had I tried to use a secretary or paralegal to perform this task, he or she \ncould only have acted as a go-between, doubling or trebling the time necessary for each to arrive at \nan itinerary. \n4.  Defendants similarly claim that the fifty-four minutes I spent on February 19, 2002 \nconferring with Plaintiffs' experts Vincent Nathan and James Balsamo regarding logistics was a task \nfor a paralegal or clerk. [Mem. 6] That is incorrect. I was in negotiations with Plaintiffs' experts at \nthis time regarding their willingness and availability to provide services in the case, and a major \npoint of concern for all the experts was the remoteness of Parchman from major airports, and the \nconsiderable time that would be involved in travel for tours.  There was a rapid back-and-forth \nbetween us in discussing these issues, while we viewed flight costs and availability together on the \nInternet. It would have taken far longer for me to conduct these negotiations had I involved a clerk \nas an intermediary, and the experts would properly have refused to waste their time communicating \non these issues with a clerk who would have had no authority to make final decisions. \n5.  Defendants claim that the 3.5 hours I spent on February 7,  2003  assembling trial \nDECLARA nON OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n2 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 3 of 18\ndocuments was a clerical task. [Mem. 6] I could not possibly have delegated this job even to another \nlawyer on the litigation team, let alone to a clerk or paralegal. Since Plaintiffs' counsel had to travel \nfrom Washington, D.C. to Oxford, Mississippi for trial, and the enormous case file could not be \nmoved in its entirety,  I had to review large quantities of documents to winnow them down to those \ndocuments I would likely use as exhibits or for impeachment or cross-examination, and those I might \nneed during procedural or evidentiary disputes, and to organize them so that they would be of most \nutility to me at trial. \n6. For similar reasons, most of Defendants' list of complaints that NPP's litigation fellow \nAmy Fettig billed for time that should  have been performed by a paralegal or clerk [Mem. 7] are \nmeritless.  Almost all of the challenged entries (for January 16, 17,22,23 and 24, February 4, and \nJune 23 and 26,2003) relate to logistics for the second tour of Parchman on the eve oftrial and for \nthe trial itself, or to  logistics for the July 2003 post-judgment monitoring tour.  These entries come \nto a grand total of 3 hours eighteen minutes.  Ms. Fettig could not have delegated these tasks to a \nparalegal or clerk, for the same reasons as explained above in ~ 5.  Logistics for the Parchman tours \nand the trial were completely intertwined with litigation decisions, and involved coordinating the \ntravel schedules of Plaintiffs , four expert witnesses and five lawyers from cities around the country, \nand negotiating with MDOC's lawyers on limitations as to dates and hours of touring and order of \nappearance of the expert witnesses at trial. \n7.  Ms. Fettig claimed six minutes (0.1 hour) on January 27, 2003 for setting up an attorney \nclient call with one of the Plaintiffs; Defendants say this task should have been done by a clerk or \nparalegal [Mem. 7].  The reason why Ms. Fettig had to set up a call on certain occasions, rather than \nhaving a paralegal or clerk perform the task, is that MDOC staff resisted placing our legal calls to \nDECLARA TION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n3 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 4 of 18\nthe death-row clients, a problem requiring an attorney's intervention.  Note, for example, the entry \nfor Margaret Winter for January 21, 2003 (\"Telephone call/write to L[ eonard] Vincent re problems \ngetting confidential legal calls with clients\"). \n8.  Ms. Fettig claimed 2.5 hours on July 17, 2002 for \"coordination of court filing.\" On that \ndate Plaintiffs were preparing to file and serve multiple documents, including the Complaint, motion \nfor preliminary injunction, and discovery requests, requiring direct and extensive coordination \nbetween the National Prison Project, local counsel McDuff, and the Mississippi ACLU.  Legal and \ntactical decisions were being made as to the timing and sequence ofthese filings, and it would have \nbeen impossible for Ms. Fettig to delegate these decisions to a paralegal or clerk. \n9.  A tiny handful of Ms. Fettig's entries - totaling altogether 1.1 hour - do appear on their \nface to relate to paralegal or clerical tasks: (7/16 attempts to fax documents to the court; 1117 filing \ndiscovery requests; 3128 cover letter, certificate of service, prepare for filing findings of fact) [Def. \n7].  We withdraw our request for compensation for these entries, totaling 1.1 hour. \n10.  Defendants' claims that certain of my time entries were apparently \"unrelated to the \ncase\" [Mem. 8] are incorrect.  First, Defendants challenge the entry of eighteen minutes (0.3 hour) \non 02/04/02 for \"gathering documents for Department of Justice inquiry.\" This DOJ inquiry was \nintimately connected with the case: counsel for DOJ's Special Litigation Section had expressed an \ninterest in bringing suit regarding the very conditions in Unit 32 about which the named Plaintiffs \ncomplained.  As this might have benefitted the class greatly, bringing to the case additional experts \nbeyond Plaintiffs' means, I provided DOJ's counsel with documents to assist them in making their \ndecision. \n11.  Defendants also complain that the twenty-four minutes I spent on July 9,  2002, \nDECLARATION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2, 2004 \n4 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 5 of 18\nconferring with Robert McDuff regarding Tracy Hansen's motion for  stay of execution was \n\"unrelated to the case.\" [Mem. 8]  This allegation, too, is incorrect: Hansen was a named plaintiff, \nand when he received an execution date it was necessary for Plaintiffs counsel to confer concerning \nthe impact of the impending execution on the litigation.  Plaintiffs did not bill Defendants for \nbringing the motion for stay of execution. \n12.  Defendants complain that the  1.90 hour I spent on August  19, 2004, researching \nexecution statistics, and the forty-two minutes I spent on August 22 conferring with Plaintiffs' \nexperts Terry Kupers and Vincent Nathan regarding those statistics, were \"unrelated to the case.\" \n[Mem. at 8] In fact, however, Dr. Kupers prominently cited to and relied on those statistics at page \n1 of his final report. \n13. Defendants complain that the twenty-four minutes (0.4 hour) I spent doing legal research \non dismissal without prejudice, in connection with \"S. Brown claim.\" (Mem. at 8)  was \"unrelated \nto this case.  In fact, the claims of named plaintiff Sherwood Brown were the subject of extensive \ndiscussion and negotiation between Commissioner Johnson and myselfbetween April and mid-June \nof 2002, when Plaintiffs were attempting to settle their claims administratively.  Sherwood Brown \nhad brought a case pro se concerning the permanent confiscation of his fan for a minor infraction \na problem affecting a significant portion ofthe class, and which was to figure centrally in the lawsuit. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs needed to have Mr. Brown dismiss his individual lawsuit in order to have him \nproceed as a named plaintiff in the class action, so as not to create a risk of inconsistent rulings; to \nthis end, I had to assist him in dismissing his individual case without prejudice. \n14.  Defendants state that on \"07/11 through 07/17\" [of 2003], I made \"entries for work on \nappeal - duplicate entries for same dates for work in the trial court.  11.50 hours.\" [Mem.  8] \nDECLARATION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2, 2004 \n5 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 6 of 18\nDefendants are correct: half of a page of the computer print-out for my hours for the dates in \nquestion contained entries for both District Court hours and Court of Appeals hours. This page was \nsubmitted with the original District Court fee petition, and then later inadvertently submitted as an \nexhibit with the fee petition to the Court of Appeals without redaction of all of the duplicate items. \nI apologize for the oversight and request that the Court simply omit from the fee award the claim for \nthe 11.5 hours that were inadvertently billed twice. \n15. Defendants contend that four of Ms. Fettigs' time entries for legal research are unrelated \nto this case. [Mem. 8]  On May 22, 2003, she spent a total of 1.9 hours reviewing 5th Circuit cases \nciting Lewis v. Casey. We undertook the research in question because Lewis addresses the authority \nof district courts to extend relief to facilities other than that where federal violations have been \nproved at trial. The Court's May 21 order had extended to all of Unit 32 some of the remedies the \ndeath row plaintiffs had requested, and we anticipated that Defendants would seek a stay on this \nground.  I believe it was for similar reasons that on May 22 and May 27 Ms. Fettig undertook legal \nresearch in Westlaw's 5th  Circuit and Allfeds databases (\"Allfedo\" is a typographical error for \n\"Allfeds\") for application ofthe Turner standard to Eighth Amendment cases; however, because I \nno  longer  recall  the  specific  need  for  that  particular inquiry,  we  withdraw  the  request  for \ncompensation for the 5.5 hours Ms. Fettig spent on it. \n16. Defendants contend that Amy Fettig's time traveling to trial is objectionable \"based upon \nher limited role at trial.\" [Mem. 9]  Ms. Fettig not only assisted me and the experts in many ways at \ntrial, she also handled the examination ofthe only named plaintiff who testified in the case, and that \nexamination covered virtually every claim in the Complaint.  Furthermore, it is incorrect that the \ntravel time from Washington to Mississippi to which Defendants object was for the trial alone:  As \nDECLARATION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n6 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 7 of 18\nMs. Fettig's time records show, her trip to Mississippi in February 2003 was also for the tour of \ndeath row on the eve of trial to prepare witnesses and gather evidence on current conditions. \n17. Defendants ask the Court to reduce the rate of compensation for lawyers' travel time to \nfifty percent of the reasonable hourly rate. [Mem. 9]  There is no factual basis for such a reduction \nin this case.  Ronald Welch, long-time Gates class counsel, did not have the resources to retain the \nnecessary experts to litigate the case and because Plaintiffs' case was considered a particularly \nundesirable one by the civil rights bar it would have been impossible for the Plaintiffs to find \ncompetent local counsel willing and able to take this case. (See the Declarations of Mississippi civil \nrights lawyers Robert McDuff and Ronald Lewis, submitted in support of Plaintiffs '  July 2003 fee \npetition.)  The travel we undertook was simply unavoidable if the Russell subclass was to be \nadequately represented. \n18.  Defendants further contend that Mississippi ACLU lawyer Sandi Farrell's round-trip \nbetween Jackson, MS and Oxford, MS for the trial \"is particularly objectionable as she did not \nactively participate at trial.\" [Mem. 9] That is factually wrong. Ms. Farrell conducted the direct and \nre-direct examinations ofthree prisoner witnesses in rebuttal to Defendants' testimony that they had \n\"fixed\" the toilets in Unit 32 between the first and second days oftrial.  These examinations were \nessential in rebutting Defendants' claims that the \"ping-pong toilets\" issue was moot. \n19.  Defendants object to the 36 minutes I claimed on July 17,2003 for responding to \nreporters' queries regarding a statement Commissioner Epps had made to the Associated Press about \nthis case.  [Mem. 9]  I did not seek out these reporters; evidently the Commissioner did, and the \npress called me for a response.  Since the statement the Commissioner had issued was factually \ninaccurate and misleading, and damaging to the cause of my clients, I was obliged to respond. \nDEC LARA TION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n7 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 8 of 18\n20.  Defendants contend that \"all hours spent on the preliminary injunction should be \ndisallowed because Plaintiffs were not successful in that pursuit.\" [Mem. 10]  That statement is \nsimply wrong: Plaintiffs' motion was one hundred per cent successful.  On July 17, 2002, within \na few days of filing the Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for TRO and/or Preliminary Injunction \nordering Defendants to permit an immediate tour of Death Row by Plaintiffs' experts and counsel; \nthe motion was set for oral argument on an expedited basis, and after argument on July 19 the Court \ngranted the  very relief Plaintiffs requested.  Defendants may have confused this motion for \npreliminary injunction with the unsuccessful  motion for stay of execution of Tracy Hansen, for \nwhich Plaintiffs did not seek fees. \n21.  Defendants also attack the hours that Amy Fettig spent on the preliminary injunction \nmotion, and on gathering affidavits in support of for the motion, on the ground that the motion was \n\"unsuccessful.\" (Mem. 10-11) As explained in the previous paragraph, this argument is baseless \nsince the motion was in fact entirely successful. \n22.  Defendants further claim that all hours expended by Plaintiffs in opposing Defendants' \nmotion for a stay of judgment and moving to dismiss their appeal should be disallowed because \nthose efforts were unsuccessful. [Mem. 11] Those efforts were essential to protect the benefits won \nby the class in the District Court.  Plaintiffs had brought this suit to trial with extraordinary speed, \nwinning both a preliminary injunction and a motion to expedite discovery and trial because of the \nlife-threatening conditions in Unit 32 during the hot summer months.  This Court had likewise \nordered expedited post-trial briefing, and issued its own memorandum opinion and final judgment \non  a highly expedited basis, in May 2003.  Defendants moved to stay the judgment in June, when \nthe Plaintiffs were already being exposed to another summer of deadly heat and lack of sanitation. \nDECLARATION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n8 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 9 of 18\nPlaintiffs' counsel could not ethically have refrained from opposing the stay, and there was solid \nlegal ground for opposing it.  What is more, Plaintiffs' efforts opposing any stay of the Court's \ninjunctions were not only ethically required but also partially successful: they resulted in an order \nby the 5th Circuit expediting the appeal in lieu of denying the stay. \n23.  Defendants list what they characterize as \"particularly egregious examples of excessive \ntime spent on a particular task''by me and by Ms. Fettig. [Mem. 12-13] The time spent on the tasks \nat issue was by no means excessive, but rather was essential to the success of pivotally important \nstages of the case, as shown below. \n24.  Defendants complain that I spent 5.3 hours on March 6-7, 2002 drafting a memo to the \nMDOC Commissioner. [Mem. 12] The March 8, 2002 memo in question was time-consuming to \nproduce because it was intended to be the basis of any future Complaint that might be filed. It was \na four-page, single-spaced document summarizing all the salient facts that Plaintiffs' counsel had \ngathered up to that time regarding death row conditions as to which my office and Holland & Knight \nwere contemplating bringing suit.  We presented the memorandum to Commissioner Johnson in \nadvance of a face-to-face meeting between Stephen Hanlon, Robert McDuff and myself with the \nCommissioner, Deputy Commissioner Epps, and their counsel, in an effort to resolve the Plaintiffs' \nclaims administratively.  The memorandum was intended to, and did, serve not only as a detailed \nagenda for the meeting but also as a good-faith effort to avoid litigation. Equally important, the \nmemorandum was a written record of those efforts in the event that negotiations failed.  Plaintiffs \nrelied upon that memorandum in opposing Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, and this Court as well as the Court of Appeals relied upon it in rejecting \nthat defense.  I used my time efficiently in preparing the memorandum and given the nature and \nDECLARA nON OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2, 2004 \n9 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 10 of 18\nquality of the document I am confident that it was prepared in  a reasonable amount of time. \n25.  Defendants complain that I spent 6.5 hours, from May through June 5, 2002, negotiating \nwith a pro bono organization known as Doctors of the World (\"DOW\") concerning Plaintiffs' \nrequest that the organization locate for us an expert witness on the subject of heat-related illness. \n[Mem.  12] Doctors of the World accepts requests from pro bono legal organizations to locate \nmedical specialists through the organization's network of volunteers, but it requires applicants for \nsuch assistance to demonstrate that they meet rigorous criteria, and to prepare detailed memoranda \ndescribing the nature and the importance ofthe proj ect, the precise expert qualifications desired, and \ndetails and timing of the tasks the expert would be expected to undertake. We needed DOW's \nassistance for several reasons: First, plaintiffs' resources for expert witnesses were quite limited; \nsecond,  medical experts with special expertise on the subject of heat-related illness were difficult \nto locate, and this was especially true because Plaintiffs were breaking new ground in their attempt \nto use medical evidence to prove that the intense unmitigated heat in Unit 32 threatened prisoners' \nlives; and third, we needed a highly-qualified expert who would be not only willing but available to \nprovide services to us on an expedited basis, giving us a report almost immediately as a basis for \nseeking a preliminary injunction to gain access to Unit 32, and then touring death row during the hot \nsummer weather.  It took several conferences and several memos to DOW's directors before the \norganization granted our application and located for us an extraordinarily well-qualified physician, \nDr. Susi Vassallo. Since the task of locating an expert with the necessary qualifications was so \ndifficult, and since our diligence in locating an expert of the calibre of Dr. Vassallo had a decisive \nimpact on the success of Plaintiffs' litigation efforts, the 6.5 hours I spent in identifying Dr. Vassallo \nand negotiating for her services in this case were hardly excessive.  All of this time was spent on \nDECLARA TlON OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2, 2004 \n10 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 11 of 18\nnecessary tasks that I carried out in an efficient manner. \n26.  Defendants complain that the 19.8 hours I spent drafting the Complaint between June \n27 and July 11, 2002 were excessive. [Mem. 12] That amount of time was necessary, however, to \nproduce a Complaint where many if not most of Plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claims would \nwithstand a motion to dismiss only ifthe Complaint on its face made it clear that certain conditions \nwhich might not in and of themselves violate the Eighth Amendment (e.g., infrequent access to \nshowers, inadequate pest control, exposure to severely mentally ill prisoners) nevertheless, in \ncombination, deprived the Plaintiffs of specifically identifiable basic human needs. The Complaint \nnecessarily went through a number of versions and redrafting as allegations were checked and \nrechecked for accuracy, new information was obtained, and capital-case counsel for certain of the \nprisoners identified in the Complaint decided that it was too risky for their clients to be identified. \nI have drafted class action complaints in many prisoner rights cases, and I am confident based on my \nexperience that the time I claimed for work on the Complaint was reasonably spent on necessary \ntasks. \n27.  Defendants complain that on July 29,2002 I spent two hours preparing a detailed letter \nand list of documents to inform MDOC's counsel about all aspects of the experts' upcoming tour \nof Unit 32, including an itinerary and a list of all the documents the experts would need to review. \n[Mem. 12]  The letter took two hours to write because I had to attempt to anticipate every aspect of \nthe tour and  clarify to MDOC's counsel in advance the cooperation we would need.  I was aware \nfrom the experience of several expert tours at Parchman over the previous four years that this kind \nof detailed anticipation of possible problems was essential to a productive tour. \n28.  Defendants complain that I spent an excessive amount of time preparing the post-trial \nDECLARA nON OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2, 2004 \n11 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 12 of 18\nbrief(34.9 hours). [Mem. 12]  Based on the experience of more than two decades working on such \nbriefs and in mentoring other lawyers in preparing such briefs, I feel confident that those hours were \nspent efficiently and productively. My time records show how many hours I devoted to each portion \nof the brief, separating out the time I spent for the proposed factual findings on environmental health \nand safety, mental illness and psychiatric care, heat-related illness, and corrections issues, on the \nproposed conclusions oflaw, and on the editing of the entire brieffor succinctness, thoroughness and \nclarity.  Since the post-trial brief is intended to assist the district court and to help shape the issues \nin case of an appeal, it was important that the facts be marshaled in as clear and persuasive a fashion \nas possible and with ample supporting authority from the record. \n29.  Defendants claim that the hours I spent on Plaintiffs' brief in the 5th Circuit and on \npreparation for oral argument in the Court of Appeals were excessive. [Mem. 12] Based on my \nappellate experience in prisoners' rights cases, I am confident that all ofthe time for which I claimed \ncompensation was productively spent in producing a first-rate brief and oral argument in order to \nprotect the District Court's decision on appeal. On appeal, Plaintiffs' counsel had to address not only \nall the substantive issues decided in the District Court but also a host of procedural issues and \narguments that Defendants had scarcely touched on in the District Court, including arguments on \nexhaustion, on the PLRA termination provisions, on class certification, and on the procedural \nimplications and consequences of the Gates decree. \n30.  Defendants claim that Ms. Fettig billed 15.6 hours on January 17 and February 6,2003 \nfor \"Reviewing W. Russell file.\" [Mem. 13]  That is incorrect. Ms. Fettig billed a total of six hours \neighteen minutes on those dates, for review of Willie Russell's file and also for preparing an outline, \nbecause at this time Plaintiffs' counsel were anticipating that Mr. Russell would be one of the key \nDEC LARA TION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n12 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 13 of 18\nprisoner witnesses at trial.  (See Ms. Fettig's January 17 entry, billing three hours six minutes for \n\"Review of W. Russell file\"; February 6 entry billing 3 hours twelve minutes for \"Review of W. \nRussell file and outline.) \n31.  Defendants suggest that because there were four lawyers in this case (Mr. Hanlon and \nI as lead counsel, with Ms. Fettig, Ms. Caramello and Ms Farrell in more junior roles) the case was \n\"overstaffed.\" [Mem. 15-16] Defendants complain that I spent 89.5 hours on trial preparation while \nMs. Fettig spent 46.20 hours,  Mr. Hanlon 44.10 hours, and Ms. Caramello 43.1 hours. [Mem. 16] \nI am confident that my work was not duplicative of work by Mr. Hanlon, Ms. Fettig or Ms. \nCaramello because Mr. Hanlon and I took care to divide the labor in the case in a rational manner \nand to assign discrete tasks accordingly to the more junior lawyers. \n32. Moreover not a single one ofm  y time entries is designated as \"trial preparation.\" Rather, \neach entry identifies a specific task. Thus, for example, in the weeks and days leading up to the trial, \nI made specific separate entries for reviewing Defendants' expert reports (e.g., January 13, 2003); \ndrafting letters to Defendants' counsel regarding document production and reviewing Defendants' \ndiscovery responses (e.g., January 13, February 5); conferring with Plaintiffs' experts Vincent \nNathan and Dr. Kupers about documents produced by Defendants in discovery (e.g., January 13, \nFebruary 5); reviewing defendants' document productions on correctional, environmental  and \npsychiatric issues (e.g., January 17 and 20); conferring with Defendants' counsel about scheduling \nthe testimony of expert witnesses and expert reports(e.g., January 23, 27, 29); conferring with \nDefendants' counsel about the pre-trial tour and the new ACA report abd other documents produced \nby Defendants in discovery (February 2,  3);  drafting testimony outlines for  expert witnesses \n(February 4, 5, 6); conferring with and writing to Defendants' counsel about irregularities in their \nDEC LARA TION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2, 2004 \n13 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 14 of 18\npsychiatric expert's report (February 6, 7); meeting with expert witnesses to prepare trial testimony \n(February 10, 11); drafting an opening statement (February 11); and drafting questions for cross \nexamination of Defendants and their experts (February 12). Defendants' unsubstantiated claim that \nmy pretrial time entries are duplicative of work done by the other lawyers is simply untrue. \n33. Defendants claim that the 8.1 hours I spent researching heat stroke should be discounted, \nas should the 6.6 hours Ms. Fettig spent researching ACA accreditation standards, as these are \n\"topics that are more than adequately covered by and spent on expert opinions.\" [Mem. 16]  I did \nthe research on heat stroke in April and very early May 2002, before we had retained a medical \nexpert, when my task was to determine how to show that exposure to excessive heat violates the \nEighth Amendment - a proposition for which there was very little precedent. It was through this \nresearch that I determined that we needed a medical expert with qualifications like Dr. Vassallo's. \nMs. Fettig's research in January 2003 on ACA's accreditation of correctional facilities was also \nperfectly appropriate and nonduplicative; it was part of a successful effort to rebut MDOC's claim \nthat ACA's accreditation of Parchman on the eve of trial proved that conditions in Unit 32  were \nconstitutional. \n34.  Defendants make the completely unfounded charge that \"all ofthe 77 hours claimed by \nSandi Farrell are objectionable in whole as duplicative and unproductive as she played no active role \nin the litigation.\" [Mem. 16] In additional to the valuable role she played at trial putting on rebuttal \nwitnesses, Ms. Farrell's time records show that the hours in question were spent interviewing \nprisoners at Parchman on May 21,22,23,24, June 6 and July 2,2002, in preparation for drafting the \nComplaint; in preparing witnesses at Parchman to testify, and in assisting Plaintiffs' experts in \ntouring and gathering facts in Unit 32 on the eve of trial, on February 10, 11 and 12,2003. I know \nDECLARA TlON OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2, 2004 \n14 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 15 of 18\nthat the hours spent on these tasks were non-redundant;  I assigned Ms. Farrell to these essential \ntasks because it was the most efficient division oflabor among the members of the litigation team. \n35.  Defendants' assertion that \"the number of telephone calls, conferences and e-mails \nexhibited in this case are excessive\" (Mem. 17) is incorrect. Defendants do not point to any specific \ncommunication;  they do  not even name any particular lawyer as  being guilty of \"excessive\" \ncommunications. I made time-entries only for communications that I knew were non-superfluous and \nnontrivial.  To take only a few examples, among scores of entries: telephone conferences with \npotential named plaintiffs to decide whether they were qualified to serve as class representatives \n(May 13, 2002); telephone calls with the Mississippi ACLU to assign the task of gathering public \nhealth information regarding conditions in Unit 32 (May 14, 30, 31, June 5); discussion with \nopposing counsel regarding the designation of the magistrate judge as the trial court (July 17); \nconference with attorney Ronald Welch concerning his views on the coverage of the Gates decree \n(July 23); conferences with class members' capital case lawyers to obtain permission to interview \ntheir clients as potential witnesses in the conditions case (July 25); meeting with the experts on the \neve of the death row tours to decide what prisoners to interview and what cells to view (August 7); \ndiscussion with the expert witnesses on the issues to be addressed in their post-tour reports (August \n13, 14, 18, 19,20,28,29); communications with the Court and with opposing counsel to schedule \na hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for expedited trial (September 23,24); telephone calls to the experts \nto determine their availability for trial (October 16, 22); letters and telephone calls to opposing \ncounsel concerning discovery (November 22, 2002, January 3,  27, 28, 29, February 5,  6,  7). \n36.  Defendants claim that Plaintiffs seek to bill them for their experts' fees in this case. \n[Mem.  22] That is incorrect. My office billed only for the reasonable, reimburseable out-of-pocket \nDECLARATION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n15 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 16 of 18\nexpenses (lodging, meals, airfare, ground transportation) that we paid the four experts for their trips \nto Mississippi for tours and the trial, and the list of expenses attached to my original fees declaration \nspecifies, as to each payment to the experts, that it is for their expenses.  The expenses incurred by \nthe experts were modest:  Each attempted to book flights at the lowest available rates, they stayed \nin moderately-priced lodgings, and their expenditures for meals were very low. The grand total that \nmy office paid out to cover the experts' reimburseab1e expenses for their combined eight trips to \nMississippi (two trips each by four experts) was $4,927.84; the remainder was paid by Holland & \nKnight. \n37.  The inclusion of charges for toiletries and clothing for Ms. Fettig on February 9,2003 \n(which she purchased because the airline had lost her suitcase when she arrived in Mississippi for \nthe February pre-trial tour and the trial) was completely inadvertent.  Plaintiffs do not claim \nreimbursement for these items and the total ($78) should be subtracted from Plaintiffs' claim. \n38. Defendants incorrectly state that Plaintiffs do not identify the nature of Federal Express \nmailings or fax charges.  The Expense Schedule attached to my original affidavit in support of the \nfee petition identifies the nature of each such expenditure, e.g., September 3,2002, Federal Express \nto M. Winter from [Dr.] S. Vassallo; September 3,2002, Federal Express from M. Winter to U.S. \nMagistrate; September 24, 2002, Fax from M. Winter to Judge Davis.  I made a judgment in each \ninstance as to the degree of urgency involved in deciding whether a document should be sent by fax, \nFederal Express or regular mail, also taking into consideration that, in my experience over the last \nseveral years, mail delivery between Mississippi and Washington, D. C. routinely takes several days. \nIn this case, in which discovery and trial were expedited, time was frequently of the essence in \ndelivering documents to experts, the Court, and opposing counsel. \nDECLARATION OF MARGARET WINTER, DECEMBER 2,2004 \n16 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 17 of 18\n39. Defendants' complaint that our charges for photocopying were excessive and not properly \ndocumented is unfounded.  My office did almost all of the photocopying that was required in \nlitigating this case from its inception through discovery, trial, and appeal; and because the case \ninvolved a class action, pretrial motions and affidavits, extensive legal research, post-trial briefing, \nand multiple motions and briefs in the Court of Appeals, the case necessary involved a large amount \nof photocopying.  Based on my experience in litigating prisoners' rights class action cases, I am \nconfident that the amount of photocopying in this case was not only necessary but well within the \nlimits of the amount of copying normally required in such cases All photocopying for the case was \ndone in accord with my office's strict policy of entering a case code into the copier before each and \nevery photocopyingj ob, and keeping exact account ofthe number ofp hotocopies made in each case. \n40.  In summary, Plaintiffs withdraw the following items challenged by Defendants: Six \nhours thirty-six minutes (6.6 hour) of Ms. Fettig's time (see '119, above); eleven and a half hours \n(11.5 hours) of my time, which was inadvertently claimed in both the District Court and the Court \nof Appeals fee petitions (see '1114); and seventy-eight dollars in expenses, for non-reimburseable \nitems inadvertently charged to Defendants (see '1137). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my \ninformation and belief, this 2nd day of December 2004. \n17 \n\nCase 1:02-cv-00261-JAD     Document 73     Filed 12/03/2004     Page 18 of 18\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI hereby certify that on this 2nd day of December 2004 I served the following document on the \nDefendants in Russell v.
