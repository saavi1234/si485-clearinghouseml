    "summary": "<p>On July 8, 1985, a group of individuals incarcerated in North Carolina state prisons filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The plaintiffs, represented by North Carolina Prisoner Legal Services and private counsel, brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the State's Department of Corrections and Division of Prisons. The plaintiffs sought relief from living conditions alleged to be unconstitutional at forty-nine minimum and medium security prisons in North Carolina that utilized dormitory-style housing where prisoners slept on bunks in large rooms.</p><p>On October 22, 1986, the U.S. District Court Judge William Earl Britt granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Over the next few years, the parties engaged in discovery and, in 1988, a non-jury trial on motions for indicative relief by two named plaintiffs.</p><p>On December 28, 1988, a settlement agreement was reached. The agreement included provisions aimed at improving prison conditions, including a requirement that the state provide fifty square feet of living space per inmate in each dormitory by July 1, 1994. The fifty square feet of living space per inmate was referred to as \"standard operating capacity\" (SOC). The agreement also required the state to replace all triple bunks with double bunks and to implement direct supervision by correctional officers in the dormitories. Other provisions dealt with peer review of medical care, visitation policies, work and study programs, fire safety, new dormitory design, ventilation renovations, medical diets, plumbing repairs, clothing and linen policies, and locker space. A settlement committee, composed of representatives of the Governor, the General Assembly, and the Department of Corrections, was created to implement the settlement agreement. </p><p>On April 3, 1989, the district court approved the settlement agreement, and it assumed the force of a consent decree. The state's efforts to comply with the terms of the consent decree were frustrated by unexpected increases in prison admissions. Prison admissions increased from a level of 17,000 admissions per year in 1988 to almost 31,000 per year by 1992. Therefore, on October 13, 1993, the state petitioned to modify the consent decree because it was unable to meet the requirement of fifty square feet of living space per inmate. </p><p>On January 7, 1994, U.S. Magistrate Judge Alexander B. Denson granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel the production of documents which had been provided to the settlement committee in order to rebut the state's claim that drastic unanticipated increases in prison admission rates necessitated modification of the consent decree. <i>Small v. Hunt</i>, 152 F.R.D. 509 (E.D.N.C. 1994). Magistrate Judge Denson also held that by filing a petition to modify the consent decree, the state waived any attorney-client privilege that may have protected the deliberations of the settlement committee, and documents related to the deliberations of the settlement committee were not protected by legislative immunity.</p><p>On June 28, 1994, U.S. District Court Judge Britt granted the requested modification of the decree to allow certain dormitories to operate at 125 percent of SOC. <i>Small v. Hunt</i>, 858 F.Supp. 510 (E.D.N.C. 1994). On July 13, 1994, the state moved to alter the recently issued modification order. The district court, in an order dated March 27, 1995, granted the state's request by allowing the state to house inmates in certain dormitories at 130 percent of SOC. Dormitories operating above 100 percent of capacity were required to provide at least 32 inches of space between bunks and were prohibited from having a center row of bunks.</p><p>On October 16, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Judge M. Blane Michael) held that increases in prison admissions and related unanticipated expenses justified the changes in the consent decree and affirmed the district court's modification. <i>Small v. Hunt</i>, 98 F.3d 789 (4th Cir. 1996). On February 20, 1997, the court determined that all provisions of the settlement agreement had been fully implemented and the court’s supervisory jurisdiction was terminated at that time. The case was closed.</p><p>In 2008, two inmates filed <i>pro se</i> motions seeking additional relief. The court rejected those motions, and directed the clerk not to accept any further <i>pro se filings</i> in the case. The case remains closed.</p>",

Defendants/appellees (collectively, the \"state\") are the Governor of North Carolina, the\nSecretary of the Department of Correction, and the Director of the Division of Prisons. Appellants appeal from the\ndistrict court's order of June 28, 1994, granting the state's petition to modify a consent decree relating to\n[1]\nconditions at the 49 prisons.  In addition, appellants appeal the district court's grant of the state's motion to alter\nor amend the June 28, 1994, order. Appellants raise both substantive and procedural objections to the district\ncourt's orders. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in all respects.\n792  I.\n*792\nThis is the latest chapter in a dispute that began in 1985 when several North Carolina prisoners filed a class\naction against the state seeking relief from living conditions alleged to be unconstitutional at 49 medium and\nminimum security prisons. Altogether, the 49 prisons comprise about half of the North Carolina prison system's\nadult male capacity. These prisons are dormitory style where prisoners sleep on bunks in large rooms.\nOn December 28, 1988, appellants and the state entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement that soon\nterminated the lawsuit. The agreement contained specific provisions aimed at improving prison conditions. One\nprovision required the state to provide 50 square feet of living space per inmate in each dormitory by July 1,\n1994. Fifty square feet of living space per inmate is referred to as \"standard operating capacity\" (SOC). The\nagreement also contained interim provisions that allowed the state to house prisoners at 140% of SOC in\n[2]\nmedium security facilities and 125% of SOC in minimum security facilities until July 1, 1994.\n\nThe agreement contained a number of other provisions. For instance, it required the state to replace all triple\nbunks with double bunks and to implement direct supervision by correctional officers in the dormitories. The\nprovision for direct supervision required the deployment of correctional officers to patrol the sleeping areas inside\neach separately locked dormitory. The state also agreed to provide access to dayrooms with a minimum of 25\nsquare feet per prisoner. Other provisions dealt with peer review of medical care, visitation policies, work and\nstudy programs, fire safety, new dormitory design, ventilation renovations, medical diets, plumbing repairs,\nclothing and linen policies, and locker space.\nThe settlement agreement provided that it would become effective upon the \"approval and ratification\" by the\nNorth Carolina General Assembly and the approval of the district court. In approving the settlement the General\nAssembly in March 1989 agreed that \"funds necessary to satisfy the terms and obligations of th[e] agreement will\nbe appropriated.\" 1989 N.C. Sess. Laws, ch. 8 § 1. By order of April 3, 1989, the district court approved the\nsettlement agreement, and it assumed the force of a consent decree.\nThe state moved on four interrelated fronts to tackle the problem of prison overcrowding and to comply with the\nconsent decree. First, the state enacted a prison cap that limited prison population to 18,000. See N.C. Gen.Stat.\n§ 148-4.1. Second, by 1994 the state had appropriated almost $500 million for new prison construction. Third, the\nstate implemented and expanded programs providing alternatives to incarceration, thereby diverting thousands of\noffenders from prison. Finally, the state enacted the Structured Sentencing Act and later accelerated its\nimplementation. See N.C. Gen.Stat. § 15A-1340.10 et seq. The structured sentencing legislation reduces the\nlength of incarceration for less serious offenders and reserves the longest sentences for the most dangerous\noffenders.\nThese considerable efforts by the state, however, were overwhelmed by double-digit percentage increases in\n[3]\nprison admissions that began in 1988. When the state, through its settlement committee,  negotiated the\nsettlement, the committee relied on a projection by the Division of Prisons that annual inmate admissions would\nincrease between 3 and 5%. The committee believed, based on these projections, that the state would have the\nfinancial resources necessary to implement the settlement agreement. However, the actual rates of admission far\n793 exceeded the projections. *793 There were significant increases of 11.6% in 1988, 17.6% in 1989, 8.1% in 1990,\n16.1% in 1991, and 8.1% in 1992. Although the increases leveled off in 1992 and 1993, total prison admissions\nhad increased from a level of 17,000 admissions per year in 1988 to almost 31,000 per year by 1992.\nThe state's efforts to comply with the 1989 consent decree and to respond to its prison crisis have come at great\nexpense to North Carolina taxpayers. By 1994 almost half a billion dollars had been spent or committed for prison\nconstruction projects. General operating expenses for the prison system more than doubled between 1988 and\n1994 to $560 million per year. Many of these increased expenses are directly attributable to the unexpected rise\nin prison admissions. For example, the state's settlement committee anticipated annual operating costs of\napproximately $68 million for newly constructed facilities, based on the projected need for about 5,000 new beds\nby 1996. Yet, because of the unexpected explosion in prison admissions, by 1994 the state had appropriated\nfunds to build facilities for 18,000 new beds, about 13,000 more than initially planned. As a result, the total\noperating costs for completed and funded construction is estimated at approximately $169 million per year. Thus,\nthe difference between current operating cost projections and the projections that guided the settlement\ncommittee's decisions represents a yearly increase in operating costs of almost $101 million. These are costs\nthat will continue each year over the lifetime of the facilities.\nAt the time (October 13, 1993) the state petitioned to modify the consent decree, it had complied with virtually\n[4]\nevery provision except the requirement of 50 square feet of living space per inmate.  The 50 square feet\nprovision was the subject of the state's October 1993 petition. Specifically, the state sought a modification of the\nconsent decree permitting it to (1) house inmates in the \"new\" dormitories at 130% of SOC, (2) house minimum\nand medium custody inmates in the \"old\" dormitories at 140% of SOC, and (3) make conforming changes to\n[5]\nother provisions of the agreement consistent with these capacity changes.  The state's petition alleged a\n\"drastic, unanticipated increase in prison admissions rates\" that \"ha[d] made performance of the Agreement's\nterms related to dormitory living space inequitable.\" The petition said that unless the court granted modification,\n\"the public interest w[ould] be harmed.\"\n\nThe district court held a four-day evidentiary hearing. Despite the unanticipated explosion in prison admissions,\nevidence offered at the hearing established that the state has been operating a secure and humane prison\nsystem, substantially above minimum constitutional requirements. The state presented testimony and affidavits\nfrom its prison administrators, superintendents, and two experts concerning the quality of living conditions in the\n49 prisons at issue. The experts noted that serious assaults by inmates on inmates had greatly diminished. They\nsaw significantly less tension between inmates and officers. They found that the addition of dayrooms had\nchanged the dormitories for the better. One expert said that the prison units operating at the interim capacity\nlevels provided a \"better quality of life and safer place for inmates and staff to live and work than most prisons\nthroughout the United States.\" Another expert said that these units have \"one of the lowest assault or violence\nrates of any prisons I have inspected.\" In sum, considerable evidence showed that the state could operate the\ndormitories at capacity levels above 100% of SOC and still provide for the basic needs and safety of the\nprisoners without risking safety for the staff.\nWithin a week of the hearing, the district judge visited two of the prison units without the parties or their counsel in\nattendance. Thereafter, by order dated June 28, 1994, the district court granted the state's petition in part and\n794 denied it in part. Specifically, the *794 court permitted the state to house inmates in the new dormitories at 125%\nof SOC but denied the state's request to continue housing inmates in the old dormitories at 140% of SOC.\nThe district court found that the settlement committee had not foreseen the extent of prison population increases\nand that the state's prison system \"is still struggling to manage the vast numbers of inmates,\" despite recent\ndeclines in admission rates. Small, 858 F.Supp. at 518. The court concluded that the public interest was best\nserved by allowing the new dormitories to continue to operate at 125% of SOC and granted modification of the\ndecree to that extent. The court refused to allow operation of the new dormitories at 130% of SOC (as requested\nby the state) because the court understood that the state had never before operated them at that level. The court\ndenied any modification for the old dormitories because operation in excess of 100% of SOC required a center\nrow of bunks, which the court believed posed risks for inmates. However, the court noted that \"[t]he record is not\nclear whether there are other older units of different dimensions or of different bunk arrangement that would\nexceed 100% of SOC and still meet the Rufo [v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116\nL.Ed.2d 867 (1992)] standard.\" Id. at 524.\nOn July 13, 1994, the state moved pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) and 60(b) to alter or amend the June 28, 1994,\nmodification order. First, with respect to the new dormitories, the state argued that the court had misunderstood\nthe evidence and thus had erroneously concluded that the state had no experience operating the new dormitories\nat more than 125% of SOC. The state's evidence in fact demonstrated that the new medium security dormitories\nhad been operated at population levels of between 130% and 140% of SOC since the consent decree had been\nentered. Second, with respect to the old dormitories, the state proposed a bunk configuration eliminating the\nmiddle row of bunks that had concerned the court. Thereafter, in an order dated March 27, 1995, the district court\nagreed that the evidence did show that the state had been operating the new dormitories at more than 125% of\nSOC. It also found the alternative bunk configuration acceptable. The court therefore granted the state's motion\nto alter or amend the June 28, 1994, order by allowing the state (1) to house inmates in the new dormitories at\n130% of SOC and (2) to house inmates in the old dormitories \"at varying capacities greater than 100% of\ncapacity, but not greater than 125% of capacity, so long as the unit does not have a center row of bunks and\nthere is at least 32 inches of space between bunks.\"\nThe modifications to the consent decree have been appealed on both substantive and procedural grounds.\nII.\nWe turn to whether the modification orders were proper on the merits. Preliminarily, we must set out the\nstandards governing the modification of consent decrees entered in institutional reform litigation.\nOn April 26, 1996, amendments to 18 U.S.C. § 3626, known as the Prison Litigation Reform Act (the \"new Act\"),\nwere signed into law by the President. The new Act is aimed in part at making it easier for those running state\nprisons to seek termination or modification of federal court orders relating to prison conditions. The new Act\n\nprovides that it \"shall apply with respect to all prospective relief whether such relief was originally granted or\napproved before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this title [April 24, 1996].\" Pub.L. No. 104-134, § 101,\n110 Stat. ___ (1996). In this case the district court proceedings that led to the modification orders and the oral\nargument on appeal were all completed prior to April 24, 1996. The state has not sought to invoke the new Act,\neither by asking us to apply it in the first instance or by asking for a remand and reconsideration by the district\ncourt. Because the state has not mentioned the new Act and because we conclude below that the district court\nwas correct in granting the state relief under pre-April 24, 1996, standards, we do not believe it is necessary for\nus to consider the provisions of the new Act. We, therefore, outline the standards without consideration of the\nnew Act.\n795 *795 Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) a court may modify a consent decree on \"such terms as are just\" if \"it is no\nlonger equitable that the judgment [] have prospective application.\" When applying Rule 60(b)(5) to consent\ndecrees in prison reform litigation, district courts should \"exercise flexibility in considering [modification]\nrequests.\" Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 383, 112 S.Ct. 748, 760, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992)\n. \"`[T]he unique nature and demands of institutional reform litigation necessitate a more flexible approach to\nmodification' than may be appropriate with respect to consent decrees between private parties.\" Plyler v. Evatt,\n924 F.2d 1321, 1324 (4th Cir.1991) (Plyler II) (quoting Plyler v. Evatt, 846 F.2d 208, 212 (4th Cir.) (Plyler I), cert.\ndenied,488 U.S. 897, 109 S.Ct. 241, 102 L.Ed.2d 230 (1988)). \"The `uniqueness' of [such] litigation lies in the\nfact that it is necessarily aimed at achieving `broad public policy objectives in a complex, ongoing fact situation,'\nwith the consequence that consent decrees settling such litigation must be viewed as embodying `not so much\nperemptory commands to be obeyed [but] as ... future-oriented plans designed to achieve [those] objectives.'\" Id.\n(quoting Plyler I, 846 F.2d at 212). In all events, however, a movant is not entitled to relief simply because \"it is no\nlonger convenient to live with the terms of a consent decree.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 760.\nIn Rufo the Supreme Court articulated a framework for examining a party's request to modify an institutional\nreform consent decree. A party seeking modification has the burden of first \"showing [that] a significant change\n[6]\neither in factual conditions or in law\" warrants revision of the decree. Id. at 384, 112 S.Ct. at 760.  If the movant\ncites significantly changed factual conditions, it must additionally show that the changed conditions make\ncompliance with the consent decree \"more onerous,\" \"unworkable,\" or \"detrimental to the public interest.\" Id. Of\ncourse, general equitable principles require that the movant's good faith be taken into account. See Plyler II, 924\n[7]\nF.2d at 1324.\nIf the movant succeeds in demonstrating that a significant change in circumstance warrants modification of the\ndecree, a court must then determine whether \"the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed\ncircumstance.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 765. As a court makes this determination, \"three matters\nshould be clear.\" Id. First, modification of a consent decree \"must not create or perpetuate a constitutional\nviolation.\" Id. Second, a modification \"should not strive to rewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the\nconstitutional floor.\" Id. Rather, a court should do no more than necessary to resolve the problem created by the\nchanged circumstance. Id. Third, within the constraints just mentioned, principles of federalism require a district\ncourt to defer to local government administrators \"to resolve the intricacies of implementing a decree\nmodification.\" Id. at 392, 112 S.Ct. at 764. This means that while \"[f]inancial constraints may not be used to justify\nthe creation or perpetuation of constitutional violations, [] they are a legitimate concern of government defendants\nin institutional reform litigation and therefore are appropriately considered in tailoring a consent decree\nmodification.\" Id. at 392-93, 112 S.Ct. at 764.\nIn light of these standards we now consider (1) whether the district court correctly decided that there was a\nsignificant change in factual conditions warranting modification of the consent decree and (2) whether the\n796 modification allowed by the district court is *796 suitably tailored to the changed conditions. We review the district\ncourt's decision for abuse of discretion, and we accept the factual findings on which the district court's decision is\nbased unless they are clearly erroneous. Plyler I, 846 F.2d at 212.\n\nA.\nAppellants do not contest the existence of a significant change in factual circumstances. However, they argue\nthat the state failed to establish that the change in circumstances makes compliance with the consent decree\n\"substantially more onerous,\" \"unworkable,\" or \"detrimental to the public interest.\" See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384, 112\nS.Ct. at 760. We disagree.\nFirst, the district court found that compliance with the requirement of 50 square feet of living space would be\nsubstantially more onerous in light of the unanticipated explosion in inmate population. The settlement committee\nhad projected that prison admissions would increase at a rate of 3 to 5% annually. In fact, admissions increased\nat an average annual rate of 12.8% between 1988 and 1993. In raw numbers, inmate admissions jumped from\nabout 17,000 per year in 1988 to almost 31,000 per year by 1993. Thus, by 1993 the prison system was getting\nalmost 31,000 new inmates each year and putting them in facilities with an SOC of just under 20,000 beds.\nMoreover, the general operating costs for the prison system had doubled since 1988. The operating costs\nattributable to all new beds added to the system exceeded the settlement committee's projections by $101 million\nannually. Evidence such as this led the district court to find that even with the recent decline in admission rates,\n\"the [prison] system presently is still struggling to manage the vast numbers of inmates that are admitted each\nyear.\" Small, 858 F.Supp. at 518.\nAppellants argue that compliance with the original decree is not substantially more onerous since the state has\nalmost fully complied with the 50 square feet requirement despite the changed circumstances. But appellants\noverlook the fact that the state has expended huge sums of money, far in excess of amounts anticipated, to reach\neven partial compliance. We do not believe the state should be penalized with the denial of relief simply because\nit has been reasonably successful as a result of very diligent, good faith efforts to comply fully with the consent\ndecree.\nSecond, the district court determined that enforcement of the 50 square feet provision would be detrimental to the\npublic interest. The court emphasized that the public has an important interest in having its institutions run in a\nfiscally responsible manner. The court also recognized that even if the state has sufficient funds to build\nthousands of new prison beds, \"the public is entitled to have the public funds directed to the most important state\nprojects and to reap the fullest benefit from the dollars spent.\" Id. at 523. Appellants point out that the district\ncourt rejected the state's contention that compliance with the decree would endanger public safety because early\nrelease of prisoners would increase the commission of crimes. The court was unpersuaded because the state\n\"could not point to any solid statistics in support of that view.\" Id. at 518. But the court's rejection of this\ncontention does not help appellants. As the district court correctly noted, the public has interests other than\nsafety. It also has an interest in how its tax dollars are spent.\nFinally, in an apparent effort to show lack of good faith by the state, appellants argue that the state's increased\nexpenditures for prison operations simply represent policy choices by the legislature to use incarceration as a\nsanction. These increased expenditures, appellants say, were not really made to comply with the consent decree.\nWe have said that \"enactment of stricter criminal laws should not be considered bad faith.\" Plyler I, 846 F.2d at\n213. Thus, we do not see increased reliance on incarceration to punish convicts as a policy choice designed to\nthwart compliance with the decree. Here, the district court found that the state had acted in good faith to comply\nwith the original consent decree, and that finding is amply supported by the evidence.\n797 The district court was correct in determining that the significant change in factual *797 circumstances warranted\nmodification of the original consent decree.\nB.\nWe now turn to whether the modification is suitably tailored. Appellants argue that even if some modification is\nappropriate, a permanent modification is not justified because the facts show that the problem (the unanticipated\nincrease in prison population) is only temporary. Appellants point to evidence showing that (1) the increase in\n\nadmission rates has abated, (2) certain measures, such as the Structured Sentencing Act, should result in the\nstabilization and reduction of the prison population, (3) North Carolina will soon divert most misdemeanants away\nfrom the state prison system, (4) the Department of Correction expects admissions to decrease substantially, (5)\nseveral thousand new prison beds are funded and under construction and will soon be available, and (6)\navailable beds (with 50 square feet per inmate) are projected to exceed the prison population in the near future.\nWe agree that a district court should only consider granting permanent relief if temporary relief will not resolve the\nproblems created by the changed circumstances. \"[T]he focus should be on whether the proposed modification is\ntailored to resolve the problems created by the change in circumstances. A court should do no more, for a\nconsent decree is a final judgment that may be reopened only to the extent that equity requires.\" Rufo, 502 U.S.\nat 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764. If temporary relief will resolve the problem, permanent relief is obviously not a \"suitably\ntailored\" solution. See id.\nWe believe, however, that permanent relief is appropriate in this case because temporary relief would not resolve\nthe problem of the enormous expense required to incarcerate the much larger population. The increased costs\nassociated with incarcerating the unforeseeably large prison population are permanent, not temporary. Annual\nprison operating costs are $101 million in excess of what the state predicted when it entered the settlement\nagreement. Even if prisoner admissions stabilized, and even if the state had the facilities to keep the expanded\npopulation imprisoned at an allocation of 50 square feet per inmate, the state still did not anticipate the added\nfinancial burden of operating a prison system with twice the number of inmates expected. We therefore conclude\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting permanent relief from the 50 square feet requirement.\nAll in all, we conclude that the modifications (including those in the amending order of March 27, 1995) allowed\nby the district court are suitably tailored to the changed circumstances confronting the state.\nIII.\nWe next consider appellants' procedural objections.\nA.\nThe first procedural issues concern the state's July 13, 1994, motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) and 60(b), to\nalter or amend the court's June 28, 1994, order. We will treat the state's motion as a Rule 59(e) motion since it\nwas \"served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\" See Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e); Campbell v. Bartlett, 975\nF.2d 1569, 1580 n. 15 (10th Cir.1992) (\"Motions served within 10 days of judgment `ordinarily will fall under Rule\n59(e),' while motions served later fall under Rule 60(b).\") (quoting Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d 1241,\n1243 (10th Cir.1991),cert. denied,506 U.S. 828, 113 S.Ct. 89, 121 L.Ed.2d 51 (1992)).\n1.\nAppellants argue that Rule 59(e) provided no basis for the district court to grant the state's motion to amend the\nJune 1994 order insofar as it related to authorized population levels in the new dormitories. We disagree. A court\nmay grant relief under Rule 59(e) to \"correct manifest errors of ... fact upon which the judgment is based.\" 11\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 2810.1, at 125\n798 (1995). In its June 1994 order the district court said that it would not grant relief for population *798 levels beyond\n125% of SOC in the new dormitories because it believed that the state had never operated them with inmate\nnumbers in excess of 125% of SOC. Upon reviewing the state's motion to alter or amend the June 1994 order,\nthe district court realized that it had erroneously overlooked evidence that the state had indeed operated new\ndormitories at levels between 130 and 140% of SOC. Having discovered its mistake about the facts that led to its\njudgment on this issue, the district court was authorized to make a correction. See 11 id. The court therefore\nproperly amended its modification order to allow the state to house inmates in the new dormitories at 130% of\nSOC.\n\n2.\nWe also reject appellants' argument that the district court abused its discretion in considering (on the state's\nmotion to amend the modification order) new evidence on alternative bunk configurations in the old dormitories.\nRule 59(e) relief may also be appropriate \"to account for new evidence not available at trial.\" Hutchinson v.\nStaton, 994 F.2d 1076, 1081 (4th Cir.1993). In that circumstance a party must produce a \"legitimate justification\nfor not presenting\" the evidence during the earlier proceeding. RGI, Inc. v. Unified Indus., Inc., 963 F.2d 658, 662\n(4th Cir.1992). We recognize that the bunk reconfiguration plan for old dormitories was not newly discovered\nevidence in the ordinary sense. However, it was newly requested evidence. In its June 28, 1994, order the court\nessentially invited the state to submit a proposed bunk configuration that would be suitably tailored under Rufo.\nThe state had a \"legitimate justification for not presenting\" the reconfiguration plan earlier because until the court\nexpressed its concern about a center row of bunks, the state had no reason to present an alternative proposal for\nthe court's consideration. See RGI, Inc., 963 F.2d at 662. In its management of the case, the court could have\ndelayed a final decision on the modification until it advised the parties of its (previously unexpressed) concern\nabout the center bunks and gave them a chance to respond. The same result was achieved by the earlier entry of\nthe modification order, which then prompted the state's motion to alter or amend. In this particular circumstance,\nwe cannot say the district court abused its discretion in granting an amendment under Rule 59(e) to allow varying\ncapacities of up to 125% of SOC in the old dormitories.\n3.\nThere is no merit to appellants' contention that the state was required to run through the entire Rufo test anew on\nits motion to alter or amend the judgment. The district court had already analyzed Rufo's first step and\ndetermined that the state was entitled to relief from the 50 square feet provision at all dormitories, both old and\nnew.\nBut the court denied relief with respect to the old dormitories because the proposed remedy was not suitably\ntailored. The motion to alter or amend was limited to the issue of whether a suitably tailored solution could be\ncrafted (Rufo's second step). Thus, another complete showing of entitlement to relief under Rufo's first step\n[8]\nwould have been superfluous.\nB.\nFinally, appellants argue that the district court committed prejudicial error by conducting a view of two prison\nfacilities in the absence of counsel after the close of the evidence. The district court correctly acknowledged that\nthe view was error, see Lillie v. United States, 953 F.2d 1188, 1191 (10th Cir.1992), so we need only determine\nwhether the error was harmless. A district court's use of evidentiary findings from an improper view is reviewed\nunder the standard governing the erroneous admission of evidence. See id. at 1192. A new trial is warranted\n799 unless the other competent evidence *799 is \"sufficiently strong\" to permit the conclusion that the improper\nevidence had no effect on the decision. Id. Applying this standard, we conclude that the view was harmless.\nThe first evidentiary hearing on the state's motion for modification ended on May 13, 1994. Six days later, on May\n19, 1994, the district judge visited two state prisons \"to get a better concept of just what the contentions were.\"\nCounsel were given notice of the visit an hour in advance, but they were not invited along. Appellants did not\nraise any objection to the visit until after the initial modification order was entered on June 28, 1994. Then, on\nJuly 13, 1994, appellants made a motion asking the district court to amend its order to eliminate any reliance on\nthe court's visit or, in the alternative, to grant a partial new trial to permit \"a properly conducted view\" or the\n\"taking of additional evidence with respect to the view.\" The district court heard extensive argument on appellants'\nmotion. The court then carefully reviewed its June 28, 1994, order \"to determine what part of its findings or relief\nmight have been based, in any way, on its view.\"\n\nThe district court determined that only two categories of findings were influenced by its visit. The first category\nwas a single finding that the two prisons were \"spotlessly clean and in good order.\" This finding is harmless\nbecause it was immaterial to what the court had to decide under Rufo. The second category of visit-related\nfindings dealt with space. But the district court's determination that the state had established changed\ncircumstances under Rufo was based almost entirely on findings concerning increases in prison admissions, and\nthe visit had no effect on these findings. The visit did have some relevance to the Rufo requirement of \"suitably\ntailored\" relief. However, the court's original decision to allow the state to operate the new dormitories at 125% of\nSOC, despite the state's request to operate them at 130%, was supported by sufficiently strong evidence\nintroduced at the four-day hearing. Thus, the visit had no effect on that decision. In the original order the district\ncourt denied the state any relief for the old dormitories, so the visit caused no prejudice to appellants on that part\n[9]\nof the order. Accordingly, the error in making the prison visit was harmless.\nIV.\nThe orders of the district court are affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n[1] This order has been published as Small v. Hunt, 858 F.Supp. 510 (E.D.N.C.1994).\n[2] The district court provided the following illustration of what these percentages of SOC mean: \n[A] 50 inmate dorm providing 50 square feet for each inmate has 2500 square feet. Operating at 125% of\ncapacity would mean that 62 inmates would have 40.33 square feet each. Operating at 130% of capacity would\nmean that 65 inmates have 38.46 square feet each. And operating at 140% of capacity would mean that 70\ninmates would have 35.72 square feet each.\nId. at 523 n. 9.\n[3] The state was represented in the negotiations by a settlement committee composed of representatives of the\nGovernor, the Lieutenant Governor, the General Assembly, and the Department of Correction.\n[4] The state had also not yet completed construction of dayroom space in minimum security facilities. However,\nthat task was completed by July 1, 1994.\n[5] Obviously, the new dormitories were constructed more recently. According to the state, however, \"new\" and\n\"old\" also relates to the size of the dormitories. Dormitories of 50 and 102 inmate capacity are \"new\" and all\nothers are \"old.\"\n[6] The state does not rely on a change in law.\n[7] \"Ordinarily [] modification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were\nanticipated at the time it entered into a decree.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 385, 112 S.Ct. at 760. Conversely, modification\nis not precluded if the movant did not actually foresee the changed conditions. See id. Appellants do not appear\nto challenge the district court's finding in this case that the state did not foresee the explosion in North Carolina's\nprison population. In any event, the district court's finding is not clearly erroneous. The district court relied upon\nthe testimony of former Director of Prisons Joseph Hamilton, who said that the settlement committee did not\nanticipate the dramatic rise in inmate admissions. The court found Hamilton's testimony \"credible and worthy of\nbelief,\" Small, 858 F.Supp. at 515, and we accept that assessment.\n[8] We also reject appellants' argument that the March 27, 1995, order (which amended the June 28, 1994, order)\nrewrites the settlement agreement to allow conditions in the new dormitories to conform to the constitutional floor\nin violation of Rufo. Even under the terms of the amended modification order, the state is required to operate the\nnew dormitories in a manner that exceeds minimal constitutional requirements.\n\n[9] We pause to note that the record reveals that the district judge, who has presided over this case since 1985,\nhas devoted much time and painstaking attention to it. We are satisfied that, the visit notwithstanding, the judge\nhas been open and fair in his conduct of the case and that his decisions have been the product of careful\ndeliberation.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

After an evidentiary hearing of four days' duration\nduring  which  plaintiffs  presented  evidence  in rebuttal and\ndefendants conducted their re-direct examinations, the court took\nthe  matter  under  consideration.  Having  fully  reviewed the\ntestimony and exhibits, the court finds that some modification of\nthe Settlement Agreement is appropriate under Rufo v. Inmates of\nSuffolk County Ja^l. 112 S. Ct. 748 (1992).  For the reasons set\nout below, the petition to modify the agreement will be allowed in\npart and denied in part.\n?INDIHGS OF FACT\nI*  The Original Action\nIn 1985, plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit against\n-then Governor  James G. Martin and others9 seeking  relief  from\nliving  condition* all«ged to be unconstitutional at 49 of the\nstate's 97 (now 92) prison facilities.  The matter came to trial\nbefore the undersigned in October of 1985.  At the same time,\nsettlement negotiations were oarri·d out und·r the oversight of\nMagistrate Judge Alexander B* Denson.

Most\ninmates were required to sleep in bunks that were stacked three-\nhigh*  Television sets were located in the dormitory sleeping areas\nand there were no restrictions on smoking.  When the inmates were\nlocked in for the night security officers wer· stationed outside\nthe sleeping areas, thus leaving, for all practical purposes, those\nareas  unsuparvised  and weaker  inmates unprotected.  There was\n•xt·nsiv· testimony about assaults and homosexual rape carried out\nbehind bunks draped with blankets, thus preventing observation by\nsecurity  officers.  Disputes  among  inmates  frequently  arose\nconcerning channel selection and volum· of the television seta.\nTh· conditions in the sleeping areas resulting from the smoking\npolicy were exacerbated by inadequate air circulation.

The Settlement Negotiations\nAt the core of plaintiffs' suit was the contention that\nmost of the undesirable or dangerous prison conditions were brought\nabout by overcrowding and their primary objective wae to alleviate\novercrowding with all of the attendant potentials for danger.  As\na result, the 50 square foot provision was crucial to the Settle-\nment Agreement.  Representatives of the plaintiff class negotiated\nfor, and received, assurances of lessened crowding due to the 5ð\n•quar· foot provision and dayroom· constructed to provide 25 square\nfeet p·r inmate.  That particular ratio was selected not because 50\n•quart £··t is constitutionally r·quir·d but b·caus· both plain-\n6\n\nSENT  BY:PÛTTERSON-HÛW,OOV  :  <¦-2Q-9á  4:35PM  ;  5157550124^\n  7Qd  3rr>  2008;  a  a\ntiff· and the Department of Corrections agreed/  then as they do\nnow, that 50 square feet of dormitory living space per innate is a\nreasonable allocation.\nDuring settlement negotiations, the Settlement Committee\nwas concerned  primarily with the financial  costs of settlement.\nThe projected rate of admissions was discussed but only insofar as\nnecessary to calculate future costs, and the discussions were baaed\nonly on the admissions projections made by the Secretary of Correc-\ntions'  designee to the Settlement  Committee,  then-Director of\nPrisons Joseph Hamilton.  Director Hamilton concluded that the rate\nof total prison admissions would increase by 3 to 5% annually from\nDecember 1989 to July 1994, at which time the 49 prison* must come\ninto full compliance with the Settlement Agreement.  The rate of\nadmissions,  although  it was a crucial  aspect of the state's\nprojections, was subject to almost no debate or scrutiny and in\nfaot is not even  referenced in the minutes of the Settlement\nCommittee's  discussions.  Nonetheless, the court  finds that the\nadmissions rate was a significant factor on which the state ralisd\nin entering  into the settlement  because, without it, the state\ncould not possibly have projected the number of beds it would n··d\nto build*\nThe 3 to 5% projection was based on faulty  assumptions\ndrawn from the felon admission rates of the previous two years4 and\ndid not adequately account for the accelerated increase in prison\n4  Hamilton's  figures  showed  a 5% increase  in felon\nadmissions in 1986 and a 6% felon admissions increase in 1987.\n\nSENT BY:PÛTTERSON-HCPKÛUY  : S-28-¢4  4:36PM ;  5157553124-.  7g¿ 377 200S;tt\nadmissions  during the first  nine months of 1988.  The state's\nprojections also were based on Hamilton's working group's experi-\nence and the trends over the previous twenty years.  In the first\nnine months of 1988, prison admissions were up over 10%.  Members\nof the Settlement  Committee  wera  aware of these  increases but\nconsidered them an aberration in light of what they viewed as the\npattern of increases developed over preceding years.\nDocuments  generated by the Department of Corrections,\nincluding press releases, reports to the legislature/ and internal\nmemoranda, expressed in 1987 and 1988 the view that admissions were\nrapidly  increasing  beyond  projections  previously  made  by the\nDepartment.  These reports are in many respects accurate and their\nexistence, and more particularly their øource, supports plaintiffs'\nargument  that the state  should  have known  that  admissions  were\nabout to begin a dramatic upward trend.  Though the court  finds\nthat  the settlement  Covmittae  did not actually  foresee and\nappreciate the significance oí the trend of increasing admissions\nat the time  they  negotiated  tho settlement,  the increase was\nforeseeable.\nThe  Settlement  Committee  obviously  wan working  under\ntremendous pressure and time constraints.  During a significant\npart of the time, this case was progressing toward a decision. As\nnoted, the primary focus of the Settlement Committee was money  —\nthe problem of finding sufficient financial resources to implement\nthe agreement.  It is not surprising, then, that the Settlement\nCommittee relied on Hamilton's admissions projections.  Nor is it\n8\n\nSENT BY:PÛTTERSON-HGPKOUY  . 6-2S-Q¿  A. · T7PM ·\nsurprising that Hamilton depended on his recollections and know-\nledge  of  the  •yetem  in  giving  hi·  forecast  o£  admissions.\nPlaintiffs attack Hamilton's credibility by emphasizing the lack o£\nany documentary evidence to support his testimony.  It is true that\nthere apparently were no memos, letters, notes or other written\ndocuments evidencing Hamilton's projections.  Nevertheless, the\ncourt finds his testimony to be credible and worthy of belief.\nThe Settlement Committee conducted its deliberations with\nthe additional aim of implementing  the changes required  in the\n*?Pl¾ll units in ell other units in the state prison system as well.\nThe  Committee  intended  to develop  and  implement  a  system-wide\n\"solution\" and standard for operations.  The Committee believed\nthat standardized conditions of confinement in the state system\nwould  be  mor·  efficient  and  manageable  from  an  operational\nstandpoint  and would  solve  the problem  of prisoner  grievances\nstemming  from perceived differences in the quality of prisons.*\nTh· Committee  also  sought  to  develop  standards  that  would  be\nconsistent  with prior agreements affecting other prison units,\nnamely  Hubert v. Ward, which involved  thirteen  facilities, and\nStacker v. woodard. involving Caledonia Correctional Institution.\nTh··e stated goals notwithstanding, the state has never requested\nthat the state's other units be brought under the terms o£ -the\ns  Because  the  state  conducts  thousands  of  intra-·tate\nprisoner transfers every year, prisoners are subjected to and aware\no£ the varying standards of prison life in the different units.\nPrisoners develop preferences and complain about those units that\ndo not measure up to the perceived quality of others*  Grievances\nof this sort promote inmate dissatisfaction and unrest, and could\nbe alleviated or minimized by standardized prison conditions.\n\nSENT BY:POTTERSON-HÛPK,ÛUV  : 6-28-54  4·37PM ·\nSmall agreement.  It iø the state's intention to establish uniform\nand constitutional standards at all prisons but to retain maximum\nflexibility in and control over that process.\nThe  state  also  assumed,  in  evaluating  its  future\nobligations, that the state prison population cap would remain in\nplace  and  that  the  state  would  aggressively  work  to  develop\nalternatives to incarceration for misdemeanants. The state further\nassumed that felons would receive longer sentences/ increasing the\nstock felon population.\nWith respect to the cap, Hamilton testified that the\n•tate believed at the time of settlement that not only would the\ncap remain in effect, it also would remain set at 18,000.  while\nth· court accepts the state's assertion that it believed the prison\ncap  would  continue  in  effect,  the  evidence  showed  that  the\nSettlement Committee wae aware that admissions would increase at a\nminimum rate of 3 to 5% and that new prison construction would\nfacilitate the housing o£ greater numbers of inmates.  The court\nfinds that the state relied on the cap to hold the population\nsteady for a limited amount of time to enable the stat· to focus on\nits construction program, but must have expected the number of\ninmates permitted under the cap to be raised proportionally &s\nconstruction took place and in fact did not rely on having the cap\nmaintained at 18,000 inmates until 1994.\nAt  the  time  of  settlement  the  Settlement  committee\nbelieved that misdemeanant admissions would drop from about ð,ooo\nadmissions per year (in 1988) to about 4,000 a year, reducing the\n10\n\nSENT BY:PQTTERSON-HÛPKÛUY  . _ _ .  .\n 6 2B 9a  4 38PM\n4.38PM .  9X57550124-\n  704\n\"stock population\" of misdemeanants from about 2,300 to roughly\n1,200.  Thia chango was to have been effected by the creation, by\nthe  General  Assembly,  of  alternatives  to  incarceration for\nmisdemeanants.\nXV*  Developments Subsequent to Settlenent\nThe state fully complied with almost all of the provi-\nsions  of the Agreement  by, or in some  instances  before, the\ndeadline dates.  Counsel for plaintiffs have visited the prison\nunits to ensure compliance and have not reported to the court any\ndeficiencies in defendants' efforts to satisfy their obligations.\nDefendants  have  made  regular  reports of their  progress ' to the\ncourt.  The court finds, without reservation, that the state has\nmade a good faith effort to comply with the terms of the Settlenent\nAgreement*\nAs a result of the settlement, conditions at the prison\nunits covered by the Agreement are vastly improved*  Correctional\nofficers make regular rounds throughout the facility at all times\ninmates are there.  At night during  \"lockdown\" one correctional\nofficer remains in the locked area with the inmates and circulates\nthroughout  the area.  This, together  with the elimination of\ntriple-bunking, has virtually ended the problem of assault by one\ninmate on another*  The constant presence of correctional officers\nhas also had the beneficial effect of better communications between\ninmates and officers, thus promoting a less hostile atmc·ph·r·-\n. The television sets are now located in the dayro©ms and only a\ncorrectional officer has the authority, or means, to change the\n11\n\nSENT  BY:PÛTTERSON-HÛPKÛUY  ;  S-28-g4  A · I<SPM  •\nchannel selection or volume.  There are two dayrooms for each dorm\nor  sleeping  area, one in which  smoking is permitted and ¤n» in\nwhich smoking is not permitted.  The television set in one dayroom\nis typically  tuned to a sports  event and the other to a movie\nchannel.  Thus, inmates who desire to sleep or lie in bed and read\ncan do so unaffected by smoke, the noise of television or, as was\nthe  case  before,  constant  bickering  over  channel  selection and\nvolume  control.  On X9 May 1994 the court,  after  giving the\nauthorities and counsel short notice,1 visited both the New Hanover\nunit, a minimum-security facility, and the Columbus unit, a medium-\n•eeurity  facility.  The unite were spotlessly clean and in very\ngood ord·r and the court was favorably  impressed with the space\navailable to the inmat«s in the new units, even those operating at\n129% of capacity.7  In both the SOC and IOC dorms viewed at the New\nHanover unit, there were two rows of bunks, one on either side with\nan aisle down the middle*  The only perceptible difference in the\ntwo is the narrows?  aisle  space b·tween the rows of bunks and\nbetween the bunks themselves in the IOC dona.  Iven so, the •pace\navailable appears adequate.\nThe Story was quite different, how·var, in an old IOC\ndorm at the Columbus  facility where 46 inmates are housed, that\nbeing 140% of the 33 person capacity for the unit.  The additional\n1  Counsel and the prison superintendents received approxi-\nmately ona hour's notice.\n7  The SOC dorm visited by the court had twenty-five double\nbunks or a 50-inmate capacity, while the IOC dorm, though equal in\nsize, had thirty-on· doubla bunks or 62-inmate capacity.\n12\n\nSENT SY:POTTERSON-HÛPKÙUY  ; 6-28-54'  d·`3¢PM ·\nbunks  are  located  in a third row down the center  of  the dorm\nresulting in two aisles only thirty-two inches wide between the\nrows oí bunks.  The difference between the arrangements in the old\nand new dorms is dramatic.  There ia no open spaae down the center\nof the old dorm and visibility is much more limited than in the\nconfiguration where all bunks are against the wall.  A comparison\nof the floor plans discloses the reason.  The new dorm is approxi-\nmately 26 1/2 feet wide by 50 feet long whereas the old dorm is\napproximately 30 feet wide by 55 feet long, with width being the\nimportant measurement.  Thus, in a room only four feet wider than\nthe new dorm, the old dorm has an additional row of 99-inch long\nbunka and lockers occupying most of what normally would be the\ncenter aisle.\nIts compliance with th« other provisions of the Agreement\nnotwithstanding, the state new seeks r«lief from the requirement\nthat it provide 50 square feat of living space par inmate by 1 July\n1994.  As grounds for relief, the state claims that tha rise in\ninmate admissions was not foreseen and that compliance with the 50\nsquare  foot  requirement  would  be  unduly  on·rouo,  inequitabl«,\nunfair and unnecessary, and a risk to public safety.\nIt  is  now  evident  that  the  difference  between  the\nCommittee's  projected  admissions  rate  and  the  actual  rate  of\nadmissions  is considerable.  In fact, the total admissions for\ninmates from 1988 to present have been much higher than projected\nin l9B8t  An 11.6% increase in 1988, a 17.6% increase in 1989, an\n8.1%  increase  in  1990, a  16.1% increase  in  1991, and  an 8.1%\n13\n\nSENT BY: PÛTTcRSON-HÛPK,ûUY  : 6-28-54  4:40PM :  9197550124-.  734 377 2008; a 15\nincrease  in  1992.  Of  late,  admissions  have  leveled  off  and\ndeclined; the Department of Corrections reported a .3% increase in\n1993 and has experienced, in the first four months of this year, a\n5% decrease in total admissions*\nBased on its calculations in December of 1988, the state\nplanned to have a prison capacity in 1994 -– at the 50 square foot\nstandard operating capacity -– of 18,429 beds.  In order to meet\nunanticipated  admissions  increases  or  raises  in' the  cap,  the\nCommittee planned to build to a capacity of 20,649 by  1996 if\nnecessary*  As events unfolded, the admissions jump —  from around\n17,000 inmates a year in 1988 to over 30,000 a year by 1992  —\nprompted  the state to accelerate construction to a much faster\nrate.  Instead of constructing only the 738 beds then necessary to\nbring  the  Small  units  into  compliance  or  the  4,800  beds  the\nSettlement Committee anticipated as necessary to bring the system\nto a capacity of 18,000, the state has, from 1987 through 1993,\nconstruoted over 13,000 new beds.  Including future construction,\nsome 9439 million has been appropriated to construct a total of\n18,242 beds. The Department of Corrections' most recent accounting\nof admissions for 1993 was 30,995 inmates introduced into a system\nWith an SOC of just under 20,000 beds*\nThe expected decrease in misdemeanant admissions has not\noccurred and those admissions in fact have increased by roughly\n50%,  reaching  almost  12,000  in  1991.  However,  misdemeanor\nadmissions  remained  within  200  of  that  number  for  1992, were\nroughly  the  same  in  1993, and  appear  to  have  flattened  out;\n.•.  •  14\n. ,  •I ' '  ' /  •  1  ¯ • J\nI .  .!  ·  .  : t '  •';••.'\n\nSENT  BY: PQTTERSON-HÛPk.ût JY  •  6-28-04  A · JØPM  ·\n'  3lS7550l2U-<  7Q4  37<7  2008:ttlS\ncomparative statistics for the early months of this year (January\nthrough February) shoved a 15% decrease in 1994 when compared to\n1993.  Due to state legislative action misdemeanants' alternatives\nto incarceration have expanded/ but they are geared primarily to\npost-admission programs like boot camps and probation rather than\nto initial diversion from prison, which of course is crucial to\nadmission rates.  For that reason, the state's efforts have not\nslowed the misdemeanant admissions rate.\nThe state argues that the legislature has done all it\ncould to reduce misdemeanant admissions but simply has not been\nsuccessful.  The court finds as a fact that the state legislature,\nwhich the ¤ourt views as \"the state\" for purposes of determining\nwhether defendants had measurable control over th· •ffort to reduce\nmisdemeanant  admissions, h«« elected to focus on po·t-admission\nrather than pre-admission  alternatives to prison.  There is no\nevidence  that  the  state's  choice  reflects  a  measured  policy\ndecision that post-admission alternatives are more effective or are\notherwise preferable to pre-admission  diversion, and the court\ninfers  that  the  state  has  proceeded  as  it  has  based  on  its\ndiscretionary choice that those avenues were, for whatever reason,\nmore attractive.  The court concludes that the escalating misde-\nmeanant admissions rate is largely within the state's control.\nThe  prison  cap  has  prompted  a  number  of  emergency\nreleases.  At present, the prison population is capped at 23,000,\nand the cap will rite to 23,500 on 30 Jun· 1994. \"When the inmate\n. ·.

Present Status of the Prison System\nAt present, the state maintains that the pool of parole-\neligible inmatea has been depleted due to the frequency with which\nth· c©roni··ion has paroled inmates and that the system therefore\ncontains fow«r parol·-worthy  4nmatas, despite the high number of\nnew admissions.

With respect to misdemean-\nant admissions, the court finds that the state is responsible for\na significant amount of the dilemma in which it now finds itself.\nThe state chose to focus on post-admissions diversionary programs\nto the exclusion or neglect of those that would prevent misdemeana-\nnts from progressing through the \"revolving doors\" of admission to\nprison and subsequent, almost immediate release.  Thus, the rapid\nincreases in prison admissions are driven in large part by these\never-escalating, numbers of misdemeanants who continue to mill into\nand out of prison in higher numbers and at faster speeds.  Th·\nstate has fch· ability to control this aspect  of admissions by\nfocusing on total diversion from prison but has not y·t •x·reised\nthat pow·z¯ to th· degree anticipated in 1988. While this aspect of\nth· cas· gives  th· court  some pause, th· state'· ability  to\nregulate misdemeanor admissions, even if exercised to the fullest\nextent, could not have prevented the situation now facing the state\nand does not preclude the state from obtaining some relief.\nIn light of the developments outlined in the sections\nabove and considering the present status of the prison system, the\ncourt finds that the state cannot fully comply with the terms of\nthe  Settlement  Agreement  by  1 July  1994 without  ordering  the\nexpedited  parole  of  large  numbers  of  inmates  that  the  state\n!I-:I  *•'••:.  •  •  ;  :.  ,  -\n• !  ,i . • .  11  18  ;.·,  f·.!l'·¯`  '•'  l  :;.`,r.

Expected Future Developments in the Prison System\nSeveral recent events are expected to have a large ispact\non the prison population in North Carolina.  Though their effect\ncannot  yet  be ascertained  with  any degree  of certainty,  these\nmeasures are intended by th· state to result in the stabilization\nand reduction of the prison population.\nThe General Assembly enacted the Structured Sentencing\nAct  in the recent  Special  Session  and it will take effect  in '\nOctober of this year.  The Act is intended to regulate the prison\npopulation  from the  \"front end\" by controlling admission  rates\nrather  than  by  releasing  prisoners  pursuant  to  th· cap,  and\nr·£l·cts the state's interest in rationing prison resources ¯- more\nserious offenders will serve long·r sentences, and misdemeanants\nwill •ith·r be diverted to other program* or will serve at least\nthree months in prison.  When th· Act takes effect, North Carolina\nwill join the majority of states by diverting most misdemeanants\naway from the state prison system.\nThe Department of Corrections expects both felony and\nmisdemeanor admissions to decrease substantially under structured\nsentencing.  It  is  expected  that  probation. revocations  will\ndecrease and that probationers will opt against prison more often\nwhen they face a minimum three month sentence instead of a roughly\n\nSENT BV:PÛTTERSON-HÛPKÛUV  :  S-28-¢4  4:44PM  :  gi97550l2a-. 04  TT7  2QCe:t*2i\n  7\n12-day sentence, as they do now.  As all parties concede, however,\nthe real impact of structured sentencing cannot yet be discerned.\nAlso as a result of the special legislative session held\nin the spring of 1994, the state has available to it an additional\n1,000  out-of-state  contract  beds, an additional  5CO beds for\ninmates in need of substance abuse treatment, and an additional 500\nbeds in local confinement facilities.  The court accepts defend-\nants' assertion that the extra 500 \"efficiency beds\" funded by the\nsession already have been occupied and accounted for.  The state's\naccess to these new contract beds is dependent on availability and\nthe state's ability to negotiate inmate placement*  These beds are\navailable now and through June 1995, at which time authorisation\nfor them will terminate unless renewed by legislative action.\nA  number of permanent  prison  beds  already  have been\nfunded and are under construction. At the standard occupancy rate,\nthe 1994-95 fjacal year system capacity is 24,136, with a prison\npopulation £or that year projected (by the Sentencing Commission,\nafter the 1994 Special Session) to be 24,698.  Accounting for all\nconstruction funded up through the Special Session, the Department\nof Corrections expects the system to have 27,247 b·d· at thm 50\nsquare feet standard, sy·t·m-wide, when construction is complete.\nAt the interim levels, if they were allowed in the Small units and\nextended  system-wide where appropriate, the state would have a\ncapacity of 31,772 beds.

Evatt, 924 F.2d  1321 (4th Cir. 1991)\nfpl·vler III,  The court's review is pursuant to Rule 6O(b)(5) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides in part that\n\"[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve\na party or a party's legal representative írom a final judgment,\norder or proceeding\" if the court determines that \"it is no longer\nequitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\"\nThe burden is on the state defendants, as the parties  seeking\nmodification,  to  show why  the  Settlement  Agreement  should  be\nmodi£i·d.\nThe standard that the state must satisfy was set out in\nRufo. wherein the Court held that \"a party seeking a modification\nof a conB·nt decree must establish that a »ignifiaant change in\nfacts or law warrants revision of th· decree and that the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\"\nRufo. 112 S. Ct. at 765.  This standard applies when the party\nseeks to modify \"a term of a consent decree that arguably relates\nto the vindication of a constitutional right,\" Id. at 760 n.7,\nwhich  is the situation in the instant case.

The Stat· Hast Show A Significant Change in Circomstanc·s\nTo  satisfy  this  threshold  requirement,  th«  atat· must\nshow that changed circumstances make compliance with the Settlement\nAgreement  substantially  more  onerous,  or unworkable  due to\nunforeseen obstacles, or detrimental to the public interest. Id.\nAs the Rufo Court made clear, however, \"Rule 60(b) (5) provides that\na party nay obtain relief from a court order when \"it is no longer\nequitable that the judgment should have prospective  application,'\nnot when it is no longer convenient to live with the terms of the\nconsent decree.\"  Id_,_  And, as Judge Phillips noted in dissent in\n¢l·vlef I.\nA major  concern  in considering  motions  to  modify\ninjunctive decrees, whether consensual or court-imposed,\nis that the procedure not be used to re-examine the basis\nof  the  original  decree  rather  than  the equity  of  the\nmodification.  Cere must b· taken not to \"impeach\"  the\ninjunction  \"in its application  to the condition*  that\nexisted at its  making\"  while  ostensibly  considering\nwhether to modify it because the conditions have changed;\ncourts  may  not  properly  \"r·verse  und·r  th·  gui«· of\nreadjusting.\"\nPlvler  I.  846  F.2d  at  221  (Phillips,  J.,  dissenting)  (quoting\nynitad States v. Swift t Co.. 286 U.S. 106, 119  (1932)).\nThe Findings of Fact set out above make clear that since\nthe signing of the Settlement Agreement, the state has experienced\na dramatic upswing in prison admissions, the full extent of which\nit did not  foresee.  These admissions  have outpaced, the  state's\nconstruction  plan.  While  the  state  did  predict  that  prison\nadmissions would rise and therefore could be said to have \"antici-\n22  *·h,\n\nSENT BV:PÛTTERSON-HOPKÛUY  ; 6-28-<34  4:46PM  ;  315755012^  704 377 2008;B24\npated changing conditions\" that would impact on the Agreement, it\nis the extant of those changes that was not foreseen.  The state\nhas satisfied the court that it joined in the Settlement Agreement `\nin good faith and has made reasonable efforts to comply with the\nAgreement.  Accordingly, the court  finds that the state did not\nanticipate the changes that in fact occurred.\nII.  The State Must Show That The Proposed Modification i· Suitably\nTailored.\nThe state cannot house the inmates being brought into the\nsystem in accord with the terns of the Settlement Agreement without .\noverriding the population level permitted by the cap and initiating\na massive early release of inmates,  if the atate is not allowed to\ncontinue operating at least some of the Small units at the interim\nlevels, the state's other likely option for immediate relief from\nthe pressures of the cap would be to transfer inmates to other\nunits not covered by the Settlement Agreement, thereby worsening\nconditions at those units.  To remedy this situation, ths state\nproposes  that the agreement be modified to allow the state to\ncontinue to house inmates in older dormitories at 140% of standard\noperating capacity, and to house inmates at new facilities at 130%.\nThe petition is, In part, suitably tailored to provide the relief\nto which the atate is entitled, and for the reasons set out below,\nthe petition will be allowed in part and denied in part.\nA.  This Court May Grant Partial Modification.\nIt is appropriate at this juncture to address plaintiffs'\nargument that the court has no jurisdiction to approve only a part\nûf defendants' request  but instead must flatly allow or deny the\nf\n23  •••=•:!

The court concludea aa a matt·r of law\nthat it may allow requested modificationa to the agreement i£ they\nare suitably tailored and \"upon auch terms aa are just/' Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 6O(b)(6), and reject those that are not.\nThe  court's  ability to grant  partial  modification is\nsupported not only by the traditional powers of a court sitting in\nequity but also by binding precedent.  The Supreme Court noted in\nBills that \"[t]he experience of the district and circuit courts in\nimplementing and modifying [consent] decreea haa demonstrated that\na flexible approach is often eaaantial to achieving the goal of\nreform litigation.\"  Rufo. 112 S. Ct. at 758.  The Rufo Court made\nit·  observation  with  reference  to the court's  obligation to\nrequests for modification, rather than actually to craft\nan  acceptable  modifloation out of the petition  offered by the\nState, Üi. at 760, but that decision does not preclude this court's\nexeroise  of discretion  in allowing  so muoh  o£ the proposed\nmodification as is proper.\nMore directly on point is Plyler v. Bvatt, 924 ?.2d 1321\n(4th Cir. 1991) f?l·vler Hi. in which the Fourth Circuit Court o£\nAppeals  found that the district court erred by refusing to give\n\"any relief  from the cell-space requirements at issue.\"  id, at\n1329  (emphasis in original).

In undertaking that task, \"the question of what\nmay be appropriate  equitable relief  from particular cell space\nprovisions of course must remain a matter for the discretionary\njudgment of the district court,\"  Id. at 1328.  The Plyler court\nemphasized consistently that \"the watchword must be flexibility,\"\nand the case was remanded to the district court with directions to\nexercise flexibility in \"keeping such pressure on as is necessary\nto insure continued good faith efforts to comply while accommodat-\ning th· reality of present inability to meet particular cell-space\nrequirements.\"  Id. at 1330.\nFinally, the court's review of the petition to modify is\ngoverned by Rule 60(b), which allows a court to relieve a party of\nfull compliance with a final order \"on such terms as are just.\"  In\nlight of this authority, and because the progress of institutional\nreform is in no way furthered by a system that affords relief only\non a strategic hlt-or-mise basis, the court finds that it hae, as\na matter of law, the authority to grant or deny the petition in\nwhole or in part.\nB·  Standards for Modification\nAs the Rufo Court explained, the court muat evaluate the\nproposed modification with reference to three factors,  irlrst, \"a\nmodification  must  not  create  or  perpetuate  a  constitutional\nviolation.\"  j¾ufo. H2 S. Ct. at 763.  The modification sought by\n25\n\nSENT BY!POTTERSON-HORKOUY  : 6- - 4  4:47PM :  519755012^  ^ ,.\n2S 9   7¢M   2008;a2\nthe •tate ~  to th· •xt·nt that it seeks to utlliz· the n·w units\nat a capacity in excess of 100% —  would not, in light of improved\noverall prison conditions, create or perpetuate a constitutional\nviolation.\nNext#  the proposed modification  \"should not strive to\nrewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the constitutional\nfloor.\"  id. at 764*  As to this factor, the court finds that the\nconditions existing under the approved modification of the newer\ndormitories from standard operating capacity to 125% of that number\ndo not merely conform to the constitutional floor, but instead are\nsuperior to the conditions mandated, at a minimum, by the Constitu-\ntion.  Defendants requested that the operating capacity in the new\ndorms be raised to 130%.  This the court cannot allow, because the\nnew dormitories have been limited under the terms of the Settlement\nAgreement to 125% and the court is in no position to speculate as\nto whether  eondiHons at 130% are satisfactory.  Institutional\nreform litigation by its very nature is subject to an inordinate\nnunbor of uncertainties,  policy  shifts,  fiscal  limitations and\nvairying other crises without the added element of modifying decrees\nin ways that will bring about unknown effects on the parties. To\neliminate all doubt, the court finds that at the present time it\nhas no basis on which to evaluate whether 130% capacity oould be\npermitted in the new dorms and that they therefore may not, at thia\ntine, be operated at that capacity.\ni\nThe  request  to continue  to house  inmates  in older\nfacilities at 140% will be denied because to allow that modifica-\n26\n\nSENT BV = POTTHRSON-H^,UV _ _ ¯   ¯ ^  3,7 ; «\n  ;6 28 g4   4:4SPM; 919755ai2   7£W  2008 2Q\ntion would r·writ· that portion of the consent decree to conform to\nthe constitutional floor. Th· state's own witnesses conceded, whan\nasked th· maximum percentage above standard operating capacity at\nwhich they could run a safe prison, that they could not advise the\ncourt of an acceptable number above 140%. On this ground and also\nfor additional reasons set forth in Section D.2., infra, operation\nof old dorms at 140% of capacity will not be allowed.\nAnd  finally, with  respect  to the third  factor,  \"the\npublic Interest and s[considerations based on the allocation of\npowers within our federal system' require that the district court\ndefer to local government administrators, who have the `primary\nresponsibility  for  elucidating,  assessing,  and  solving'  the\nproblems of institutional reform, to resolve the intricacies of\nimplementing a decree modification.\"  Id. at 764 (quoting Board of\nBduc. of Okla. Cifcv Soh«. v. Dov»ll. HI 8. Ct. 630, 632 (1991)).\nThe court will/ as it must, leave to the state to determine) the\n\"intricacia«\" of operating the prison unit at the allowed capacity\nlevels.  The discretionary decisions that must be made to ensure\nthe state's compliance with all other aspects of the Settlement\nAgreement remain, of course, the responsibility of the state.\nC.  Balancing of the interests\nBound up in the determination of whether modification is\nwarranted at all, and if so in what form, is the court's obligation\nto balance the interests of the parties. The court has done so and\nconcludes that the interests of the parties and tht public are best\nserved by allowing partial modification.\n27\n\nSENT BY:PÛTTERSON-HORKÛUY  ; S-28-g4  4:4ÏPM ;  919755312a-  734 ST7 2008:«2¢\nIn making thi· assessment, tha court ha· considered the\npublic  interest in several respects, the most obvious being the\npublic's  interest  in being  free  from  risks of increased  crime\nbrought about by the early release of prisoners, insofar as the\nrelease is due to overcrowding and not to some other institutional\nfactor. As noted above, the view that prison overcrowding leads to\nearly releases, which in turn lead to the commission of crimes that\nwould have been avoided had the prisoners served the time that was\nexcluded diia to overcrowding, is widely held but based largely on\nanecdotal evidence.  Even more telling, in the court's viaw, is the\nfrequent coupling of this view with the argument  that prisoners\nsimply get out too early, should serve more of their sentences, and\nhave lost raapeot for a system that cannot contain them.  While\neach of these  views has at least  some validity and are quite\nproperly part of the public discourse, they do not come together to\nprovide any kind of cumulative proof of \"public risk.\"\nSeveral  of the state's  witnesses,  most  notably Mr.\nPhillips, opined that early releases increase the public risk but\napparently founded those views on tha belief that criminals hav«\nlost respect for imprisonment as a sanction and opt for prison time\nrather than some lesser form of supervision because Ihey know their\nactual time in prison will be significantly shorter than that to\nwhich they were sentenced.  This may well be true, but the fact\nremains that prisoners get out of prison early not only because o£\ncap-mandated  \"emergency releases\" but also because of good time,\ngain  time,  mandatory  90 day releases,  260 day releases, and\n28\n\nSENT BV·.PÛTTERSON-HÛRKÛUV  ;  6-28-54  4:4,PM;  5i99SSØl¿-  784  T77  2«»:  «3Q\ncommunity  service parole, all of which are either  sanctioned or\nmandated by the state.  The state has not shown that the housing\nlevels allowed under this Ordar will cause a massive early release\nthat  will  result  in the  release of any individuals  who are\nconsidered to be a risk to the public welfare.\nThe  public, of course,  has  other  interests as well;\nincluding a strong interest in having the state abide by the terms\nof agreements made on its behalf*  It is no email matter for the\netate to seek  relief  from  the  enforcement of a binding  legal\nagreement*  Further,  the  public  has an interest in having  its\ninstitutions run  in a fiscally responsible way.  Even j¿ the etate\nhas •ufficient funds to build thousands of new prison beds, as it\nconceivably might in light of the state's relative prosperity this\nyear, the public is entitled to have the public funde directed to\nthe moot important state projects and to reap the fullest benefit\nfrom the dollars spent.  As the Rufo Court recognized, a consent\njudgment or settlement agreement hae a substantial \"impact on the\npublic'e  right to sound and efficient  operation of its  institu-\ntions.\"  Rufo. 112 S. Ct. at 799 (quoting H«ath v. Da Courev, 888\nI¯.2d 1005, 1009  (6th Cir.  1989)).  In this ca·e, as to the new\nunite, the public interest is beet served by allowing those units\nto be managed safely, humanely, and efficiently at 125% of SOC.\nD.

The Newer Dorms\nThe newer dorms do not have center rows of bunk beds and\nprovide a fairly spacious environment while simultaneously enabling\nthe state to house more inmates. An increase to 125% of SOC in the\nnewer dorms would not prasent any appreciable increased  risk to\nInmates or significantly impact on any other terms of the settle-\nment agreement.  Taking into account the cumulative effect of all\nof th· improvements to th· prison system, the inmates housed in\nth«a· newer dorms  (assuming no middle row of bunks) at interim\noperating capacity ar· receiving almost all o£ th· benefit of their\nbargain and are being  housed  in conditions  that  substantially\nsurpass the minimum standards mandated by the constitution.\n2.  The Older Dorms\nThe state's request is not suitably tailored as to the\nolder dorms.  Under the standard configuration in the older donii,\n•  For purposes of illustration, a 50 inmate dorm providing\n50 square feet for each inmate has 2500 square feet.  Operating at\n125% of capacity would mean that 62 inmates would.have 40.33 square\nfeet  each.  Operating  at 130% of capacity  would  mean  that 65\ninmates would have 38.46 square feet each.  And, operating at 140%\nof eapaoity would mean that 70 inmates would have 35.72 square feet\neach.  As a matter of fact, most of the dorros are not evenly\ndivisible by 50 square feet.\n30\n\nSENT  BY:POTTERSON-HÛPK.ûl.JV  ;  6-2S-S\n37·7  2008-·tt32\nth·y include a c·nt·r row of bunks.  This arrangement, tak·n in\nconnection with all othar aspects of the prison dormitory environ-\nment, brings about increased risks for inmates and guards alike*\nThe center row blocks vision and reduces the space between bunks to\nat little as 33\".  The lack of a clear line of vision through the\ndorms was a very important factor in the initial action because it\ncontributed  in large part to the ease with which inmates could\nassault each other.  As noted, the court viewed a representative\nunit  in this configuration  and concludes that although  it was\nacceptable for the interim period, it must not be perpetuated.  For\nthe foregoing reasons, the court finds that continued use of the\ncenter bunks presents sufficient risks to weigh against th· state's\nproposal to continue to house inmates at interim levels in the\ndorms whose interim capacity levels necessitated the use of center\nbunks.  This decision is based on the court's observation of the\neonditions in the old dorm at the Columbus unit and the particular\ndiman·ion· o£  the  unit  and  th«  w·y  in Which  th· bunks  Were\narranged.  The record is not clear wh·th·r there are other older\nunits of different dimensions ox o£ different bunk arrangement that\nwould exceed 100% of SOC and still xn·«t the Rufo standard.\nCOHCLtJðlOM\nFor the foregoing reasons, th· Petition to Modify th·\nSettlement Agreement to allow defendants to hou·· inmat·· in th·\nnewer dorms at 1301 of capacity is DENIED; how«vos, the s·ttlem·nt\nAgreement is MODIFIED to allow defendants to houa« imnat·· in *h·\nnewer dorms at 125% of capacity.

Dept. of Justice, Raleigh, NC, for defendants.\nORDER\nBRITT, District Judge.\nIn October of 1993, the State of North Carolina filed a petition to modify the Settlement Agreement signed by\nrepresentatives of the state and the plaintiff class in December of 1988. Though the petition necessarily impacts\nother provisions of the Settlement Agreement as well, the state's primary request is to modify the requirement\nthat state prisoners have 50 square feet of dormitory living space per inmate (the \"50 foot provision\"), as provided\nin the Settlement, to allow the state to operate the new dormitories at 130% of capacity and the old dormitories at\n[1]\n140% of capacity.  Pursuant to agreement between the parties, the state provided its written evidence of\ngrounds for modification to the court prior to the hearing, that serving as defendants' direct evidence. After an\nevidentiary hearing of four days' duration during which plaintiffs presented evidence in rebuttal and defendants\nconducted their redirect examinations, the court took the matter under consideration. Having fully reviewed the\ntestimony and exhibits, the court finds that some modification of the Settlement Agreement is appropriate under \nRufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992). For the reasons set\nout below, the petition to modify the agreement will be allowed in part and denied in part.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI. The Original Action\n[2]\nIn 1985, plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit against then Governor James G. Martin and others  seeking relief\nfrom living conditions alleged to be unconstitutional at 49 of the state's 97 (now 92) prison facilities. The matter\ncame to trial before the undersigned in October of 1985. At the same time, settlement negotiations were carried\nout under the oversight of Magistrate Judge Alexander B. Denson. Representing the state in the negotiations was\na Settlement Committee composed of representatives of the Governor's and Lieutenant Governor's offices, the\n513 General Assembly and the Department of Corrections.[3]*513 The trial had been underway for approximately six\nweeks and had been stayed temporarily at the request of the state when, on 22 December 1988, a settlement\nwas reached and a Settlement Agreement signed by counsel for the parties.\nDuring the trial, plaintiffs presented evidence tending to show that conditions in the 49 state prison facilities at\nissue (the \"Small units\") did not meet constitutional standards. Most inmates were required to sleep in bunks that\nwere stacked three-high. Television sets were located in the dormitory sleeping areas and there were no\nrestrictions on smoking. When the inmates were locked in for the night security officers were stationed outside\n\nthe sleeping areas, thus leaving, for all practical purposes, those areas unsupervised and weaker inmates\nunprotected. There was extensive testimony about assaults and homosexual rape carried out behind bunks\ndraped with blankets, thus preventing observation by security officers. Disputes among inmates frequently arose\nconcerning channel selection and volume of the television sets. The conditions in the sleeping areas resulting\nfrom the smoking policy were exacerbated by inadequate air circulation. All of these conditions taken together\nmade it difficult for inmates to have any sense of security from other inmates and to get any meaningful sleep.\nThere also was extensive evidence presented regarding the adequacy of toilet and bath facilities, lockers for\nstorage of personal items, fire safety, medical care and clothing. In addition, there was considerable evidence\npresented about the adequacy of food for general population inmates and those with special dietary needs and\nthe sanitary conditions under which food was prepared and served. Finally, there was evidence presented\nregarding the visitation practices and the educational, vocational and other programs 00 or lack of them 00 for\n97 97\ninmates. Testimony was received from experts as to the minimum standards that should be met with regard to the\nconditions in the units as they then existed regarding space, clothing allowances, medical care, etc.\nII. The Settlement Agreement\nUnder the terms of the Settlement Agreement, as summarized below, the state agreed to:\n1. (a) Eliminate triple bunks in the 49 units by 1 July 1989, replacing them with double bunks\nproportioned comparably to military surplus double bunks;\n(b) Provide 50 square feet of living space per inmate in each dormitory by 1 July 1994 (\"standard\noperating capacity\" or \"SOC\");\n(c) House inmates according to an interim plan by 1 July 1990, which equated to 140% of SOC in\nthe medium security facilities and 125% in minimum security facilities (\"interim operating capacity\"\nor \"IOC\");\n(d) Refrain from allowing the dormitories to exceed capacity level for more than 120 days in any\ncalendar year, unless the excess population is no more than 20% over the then applicable\ncapacity level and is due to program participation, health reasons, family emergencies, or other\nreasons deemed to be in the interest of the inmates.\n2. Provide access to dayrooms with a minimum of 25 square feet per prisoner in medium custody\nprisons by 1 July 1993 and in minimum custody prisons by 1 July 1994.\n3. Employ and deploy corrections staff to provide, at a minimum, one staff person for the inside of\neach separately locked dormitory by 1 July 1990.\n4. Provide peer review of medical care by professionals both within and outside the Department of\nCorrections by 1 January 1990.\n5. Adjust visitation policies to avoid lock-downs of general population inmates who are not\n514 receiving visitors as soon as *514 feasible, but not later than 1 January 1990 for minimum custody\nand 1 July 1990 for medium custody units. Plaintiffs agreed to not disrupt visitation.\n6. Provide vocational and educational program opportunities for inmates in connection with the\nDepartment of Community Colleges.\n7. Institute fire safety policies and procedures.\n8. Renovate ventilation systems, at the few prisons that were not then sufficiently ventilated, to\nprovide ventilation of at least 10 cubic feet of outside or recirculated filtered air per minute per\noccupant and to institute maintenance and repair procedures by 1 July 1990 for medium custody\nprisons and 1 July 1991 for minimum custody prisons. Plaintiffs agreed to not abuse or interfere\nwith the ventilation systems.\n\n9. Design new dormitory construction to provide 50 square feet per inmate by 1 July 1994 and to\nmeet minimum requirements regarding the numbers of wash basins, toilets, and lockers, and the\navailability of lighting and ventilation.\n10. Adopt and implement a new policy providing for medical diets.\n11. Maintain and promptly repair all plumbing fixtures. Plaintiffs agreed to not abuse the plumbing\nfixtures.\n12. Provide a minimum and specified amount of clothing to prisoners.\n13. Replace aging lockers with lockers of at least four cubic feet.\nThe Settlement Agreement also provided for this court's continuing jurisdiction over the case, for periodic reports\nto plaintiffs' counsel on the state's progress (these reports also have been made to the court), for implementation\nof the agreement to be monitored by North Carolina Prisoner Legal Services, Inc., and for plaintiffs' attorneys'\nfees. Defendants did not admit liability as to any issues raised in the complaints or to any violations of the\nConstitution.\nThe Settlement Agreement was signed by counsel for the parties on 20 December 1988. In March of 1989 it was\napproved by the General Assembly in Chapter 8, 1989 Session Laws, which provides in part:\nNotwithstanding GS 114-2.1, the settlement agreement entered into by the parties on December\n20, 1988, in the cases of Small v. Martin, No. 85-987-CRT (E.D.N.C.) and Thorne v. Martin, No.\n87-446-CRT (E.D.N.C.) is hereby approved, and funds necessary to satisfy the terms and\nobligations of that agreement will be appropriated.\nOn 3 April 1989 the Settlement Agreement received final approval by Order of this court. Since enactment, the\nGeneral Assembly has not modified or repealed Chapter 8.\nIII. The Settlement Negotiations\nAt the core of plaintiffs' suit was the contention that most of the undesirable or dangerous prison conditions were\nbrought about by overcrowding and their primary objective was to alleviate overcrowding with all of the attendant\npotentials for danger. As a result, the 50 square foot provision was crucial to the Settlement Agreement.\nRepresentatives of the plaintiff class negotiated for, and received, assurances of lessened crowding due to the 50\nsquare foot provision and dayrooms constructed to provide 25 square feet per inmate. That particular ratio was\nselected not because 50 square feet is constitutionally required but because both plaintiffs and the Department of\nCorrections agreed, then as they do now, that 50 square feet of dormitory living space per inmate is a reasonable\nallocation.\nDuring settlement negotiations, the Settlement Committee was concerned primarily with the financial costs of\nsettlement. The projected rate of admissions was discussed but only insofar as necessary to calculate future\ncosts, and the discussions were based only on the admissions projections made by the Secretary of Corrections'\ndesignee to the Settlement Committee, then-Director of Prisons Joseph Hamilton. Director Hamilton concluded\nthat the rate of total prison admissions would increase by 3 to 5% annually from December 1988 to July 1994, at\nwhich time the 49 prisons must come into full compliance with the Settlement Agreement. The rate of admissions,\n515 although it was a crucial *515 aspect of the state's projections, was subject to almost no debate or scrutiny and in\nfact is not even referenced in the minutes of the Settlement Committee's discussions. Nonetheless, the court\nfinds that the admissions rate was a significant factor on which the state relied in entering into the settlement\nbecause, without it, the state could not possibly have projected the number of beds it would need to build.\nThe 3 to 5% projection was based on faulty assumptions drawn from the felon admission rates of the previous\n[4]\ntwo years  and did not adequately account for the accelerated increase in prison admissions during the first\nnine months of 1988. The state's projections also were based on Hamilton's working group's experience and the\n\ntrends over the previous twenty years. In the first nine months of 1988, prison admissions were up over 10%.\nMembers of the Settlement Committee were aware of these increases but considered them an aberration in light\nof what they viewed as the pattern of increases developed over preceding years.\nDocuments generated by the Department of Corrections, including press releases, reports to the legislature, and\ninternal memoranda, expressed in 1987 and 1988 the view that admissions were rapidly increasing beyond\nprojections previously made by the Department. These reports are in many respects accurate and their\nexistence, and more particularly their source, supports plaintiffs' argument that the state should have known that\nadmissions were about to begin a dramatic upward trend. Though the court finds that the Settlement Committee\ndid not actually foresee and appreciate the significance of the trend of increasing admissions at the time they\nnegotiated the settlement, the increase was foreseeable.\nThe Settlement Committee obviously was working under tremendous pressure and time constraints. During a\nsignificant part of the time, this case was progressing toward a decision. As noted, the primary focus of the\nSettlement Committee was money 00 the problem of finding sufficient financial resources to implement the\n97\nagreement. It is not surprising, then, that the Settlement Committee relied on Hamilton's admissions projections.\nNor is it surprising that Hamilton depended on his recollections and knowledge of the system in giving his\nforecast of admissions. Plaintiffs attack Hamilton's credibility by emphasizing the lack of any documentary\nevidence to support his testimony. It is true that there apparently were no memos, letters, notes or other written\ndocuments evidencing Hamilton's projections. Nevertheless, the court finds his testimony to be credible and\nworthy of belief.\nThe Settlement Committee conducted its deliberations with the additional aim of implementing the changes\nrequired in the Small units in all other units in the state prison system as well. The Committee intended to\ndevelop and implement a system-wide \"solution\" and standard for operations. The Committee believed that\nstandardized conditions of confinement in the state system would be more efficient and manageable from an\noperational standpoint and would solve the problem of prisoner grievances stemming from perceived differences\n[5]\nin the quality of prisons.  The Committee also sought to develop standards that would be consistent with prior\nagreements affecting other prison units, namely Hubert v. Ward, which involved thirteen facilities, and Stacker v.\nWoodard, involving Caledonia Correctional Institution. These stated goals notwithstanding, the state has never\nrequested that the state's other units be brought under the terms of the Small agreement. It is the state's intention\nto establish uniform and constitutional standards at all prisons but to retain maximum flexibility in and control over\nthat process.\n516 *516 The state also assumed, in evaluating its future obligations, that the state prison population cap would\nremain in place and that the state would aggressively work to develop alternatives to incarceration for\nmisdemeanants. The state further assumed that felons would receive longer sentences, increasing the stock\nfelon population.\nWith respect to the cap, Hamilton testified that the state believed at the time of settlement that not only would the\ncap remain in effect, it also would remain set at 18,000. While the court accepts the state's assertion that it\nbelieved the prison cap would continue in effect, the evidence showed that the Settlement Committee was aware\nthat admissions would increase at a minimum rate of 3 to 5% and that new prison construction would facilitate the\nhousing of greater numbers of inmates. The court finds that the state relied on the cap to hold the population\nsteady for a limited amount of time to enable the state to focus on its construction program, but must have\nexpected the number of inmates permitted under the cap to be raised proportionally as construction took place\nand in fact did not rely on having the cap maintained at 18,000 inmates until 1994.\nAt the time of settlement the Settlement Committee believed that misdemeanant admissions would drop from\nabout 8,000 admissions per year (in 1988) to about 4,000 a year, reducing the \"stock population\" of\nmisdemeanants from about 2,500 to roughly 1,200. This change was to have been effected by the creation, by\nthe General Assembly, of alternatives to incarceration for misdemeanants.\n\nIV. Developments Subsequent to Settlement\nThe state fully complied with almost all of the provisions of the Agreement by, or in some instances before, the\ndeadline dates. Counsel for plaintiffs have visited the prison units to ensure compliance and have not reported to\nthe court any deficiencies in defendants' efforts to satisfy their obligations. Defendants have made regular reports\nof their progress to the court. The court finds, without reservation, that the state has made a good faith effort to\ncomply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.\nAs a result of the settlement, conditions at the prison units covered by the Agreement are vastly improved.\nCorrectional officers make regular rounds throughout the facility at all times inmates are there. At night during\n\"lockdown\" one correctional officer remains in the locked area with the inmates and circulates throughout the\narea. This, together with the elimination of triple-bunking, has virtually ended the problem of assault by one\ninmate on another. The constant presence of correctional officers has also had the beneficial effect of better\ncommunications between inmates and officers, thus promoting a less hostile atmosphere. The television sets are\nnow located in the dayrooms and only a correctional officer has the authority, or means, to change the channel\nselection or volume. There are two dayrooms for each dorm or sleeping area, one in which smoking is permitted\nand one in which smoking is not permitted. The television set in one dayroom is typically tuned to a sports event\nand the other to a movie channel. Thus, inmates who desire to sleep or lie in bed and read can do so unaffected\nby smoke, the noise of television or, as was the case before, constant bickering over channel selection and\n[6]\nvolume control. On 19 May 1994 the court, after giving the authorities and counsel short notice,  visited both the\nNew Hanover unit, a minimum-security facility, and the Columbus unit, a medium-security facility. The units were\nspotlessly clean and in very good order and the court was favorably impressed with the space available to the\n[7]\ninmates in the new units, even those operating at 125% of capacity.  In both the SOC and IOC dorms viewed at\nthe New Hanover unit, there were two rows of bunks, one on either side with an aisle down the middle. The only\n517 perceptible difference in the two is the narrower aisle space between the rows of bunks and between the bunks \n*517 themselves in the IOC dorm. Even so, the space available appears adequate.\nThe story was quite different, however, in an old IOC dorm at the Columbus facility where 46 inmates are housed,\nthat being 140% of the 33 person capacity for the unit. The additional bunks are located in a third row down the\ncenter of the dorm resulting in two aisles only thirty-two inches wide between the rows of bunks. The difference\nbetween the arrangements in the old and new dorms is dramatic. There is no open space down the center of the\nold dorm and visibility is much more limited than in the configuration where all bunks are against the wall. A\ncomparison of the floor plans discloses the reason. The new dorm is approximately 26½ feet wide by 50 feet long\nwhereas the old dorm is approximately 30 feet wide by 55 feet long, with width being the important measurement.\nThus, in a room only four feet wider than the new dorm, the old dorm has an additional row of 99-inch long bunks\nand lockers occupying most of what normally would be the center aisle.\nIts compliance with the other provisions of the Agreement notwithstanding, the state now seeks relief from the\nrequirement that it provide 50 square feet of living space per inmate by 1 July 1994. As grounds for relief, the\nstate claims that the rise in inmate admissions was not foreseen and that compliance with the 50 square foot\nrequirement would be unduly onerous, inequitable, unfair and unnecessary, and a risk to public safety.\nIt is now evident that the difference between the Committee's projected admissions rate and the actual rate of\nadmissions is considerable. In fact, the total admissions for inmates from 1988 to present have been much higher\nthan projected in 1988: An 11.6% increase in 1988, a 17.6% increase in 1989, an 8.1% increase in 1990, a\n16.1% increase in 1991, and an 8.1% increase in 1992. Of late, admissions have leveled off and declined; the\nDepartment of Corrections reported a .5% increase in 1993 and has experienced, in the first four months of this\nyear, a 5% decrease in total admissions.\nBased on its calculations in December of 1988, the state planned to have a prison capacity in 1994 00 at the 50\n97\nsquare foot standard operating capacity 00 of 18,429 beds. In order to meet unanticipated admissions increases\n97\nor raises in the cap, the Committee planned to build to a capacity of 20,649 by 1996 if necessary. As events\nunfolded, the admissions jump 00 from around 17,000 inmates a year in 1988 to over 30,000 a year by 1992 00\n97 97\n\nprompted the state to accelerate construction to a much faster rate. Instead of constructing only the 738 beds\nthen necessary to bring the Small units into compliance or the 4,800 beds the Settlement Committee anticipated\nas necessary to bring the system to a capacity of 18,000, the state has, from 1987 through 1993, constructed\nover 13,000 new beds. Including future construction, some $439 million has been appropriated to construct a\ntotal of 18,242 beds. The Department of Corrections' most recent accounting of admissions for 1993 was 30,995\ninmates introduced into a system with an SOC of just under 20,000 beds.\nThe expected decrease in misdemeanant admissions has not occurred and those admissions in fact have\nincreased by roughly 50%, reaching almost 12,000 in 1991. However, misdemeanor admissions remained within\n200 of that number for 1992, were roughly the same in 1993, and appear to have flattened out; comparative\nstatistics for the early months of this year (January through February) showed a 15% decrease in 1994 when\ncompared to 1993. Due to state legislative action misdemeanants' alternatives to incarceration have expanded,\nbut they are geared primarily to post-admission programs like boot camps and probation rather than to initial\ndiversion from prison, which of course is crucial to admission rates. For that reason, the state's efforts have not\nslowed the misdemeanant admissions rate.\nThe state argues that the legislature has done all it could to reduce misdemeanant admissions but simply has not\nbeen successful. The court finds as a fact that the state legislature, which the court views as \"the state\" for\npurposes of determining whether defendants had measurable control over the effort to reduce misdemeanant\nadmissions, has elected to focus on post-admission rather than pre-admission alternatives to prison. There is no\n518 evidence that the state's choice *518 reflects a measured policy decision that post-admission alternatives are\nmore effective or are otherwise preferable to pre-admission diversion, and the court infers that the state has\nproceeded as it has based on its discretionary choice that those avenues were, for whatever reason, more\nattractive. The court concludes that the escalating misdemeanant admissions rate is largely within the state's\ncontrol.\nThe prison cap has prompted a number of emergency releases. At present, the prison population is capped at\n23,000, and the cap will rise to 23,500 on 30 June 1994. When the inmate population exceeds 98% of the cap\namount for fifteen days, the cap mandates a population reduction, and the state Parole Commission must parole\na sufficient number of inmates to reduce the population to 97% of the cap level within ninety days. If the cap\nnumber is increased during an emergency, as it was just prior to the hearing in this matter and as it will be again\non 30 June, the clock begins to run anew. During a cap emergency the Parole Commission must parole inmates\nwho are eligible but who often are, in the Commission's view, bad candidates for parole. With the exception of 90-\nday parole, the inmates cannot be and are not paroled if the Commission believes that they are likely to pose a\ndanger to the public.\nThe state's contention that the early release of inmates results in increased risk to the public has a superficial or\nat least widely-accepted logic to it but is supported only by anecdotal evidence. The state argued through\nDirector of Prisons Lynn Phillips that inmates released \"early\" are more likely to commit violent crimes but could\nnot point to any solid statistics in support of that view. The evidence showed: 1) every inmate serving a sentence\nof 18 months or more must, according to statute, be released 90 days prior to the end of his or her sentence,\nwithout regard to the inmate's likelihood of committing further crimes; 2) any felon serving a sentence of 18\nmonths or greater is eligible for parole when he or she is within 270 days of the sentence completion date; and 3)\ninmates' parole dates are affected by good time and gain time, both of which are administered by the Department\nof Corrections and reduce inmates' sentences based on good behavior (on a day for day basis) or inmates'\ninvolvement in work or rehabilitative activities. In addition, Community Service Parole is available to almost all\n[8]\ninmates  if the parole board finds that the inmate is a proper candidate. Moreover, most misdemeanants and\nyouthful offenders are eligible to be considered for parole at any time after admission. With respect to all of these\nforms of parole, the Commission may not parole any inmate convicted of murder, rape, kidnapping or drug\ntrafficking for purposes of meeting the cap requirements.\n\nV. Present Status of the Prison System\nAt present, the state maintains that the pool of parole-eligible inmates has been depleted due to the frequency\nwith which the Commission has paroled inmates and that the system therefore contains fewer parole-worthy\ninmates, despite the high number of new admissions. A large proportion of the prisoners who technically are\neligible for parole are not promising candidates for varying reasons; for example, an eligible prisoner may not\nhave served a sufficient portion of his sentence, may be at a higher custody level, may previously have had his\nparole revoked, may have a serious criminal or poor prison record, or may be involved in ongoing mental health\ntreatment or rehabilitative programs. Others may reject parole, may still be addicted to drugs or alcohol, or have\nno residence plan upon release.\nAs discussed above, even with declining admission rates the system presently is still struggling to manage the\nvast numbers of inmates that are admitted each year. With respect to misdemeanant admissions, the court finds\nthat the state is responsible for a significant amount of the dilemma in which it now finds itself. The state chose to\n519 focus on post-admissions diversionary programs to the *519 exclusion or neglect of those that would prevent\nmisdemeanants from progressing through the \"revolving doors\" of admission to prison and subsequent, almost\nimmediate release. Thus, the rapid increases in prison admissions are driven in large part by these ever-\nescalating numbers of misdemeanants who continue to mill into and out of prison in higher numbers and at faster\nspeeds. The state has the ability to control this aspect of admissions by focusing on total diversion from prison\nbut has not yet exercised that power to the degree anticipated in 1988. While this aspect of the case gives the\ncourt some pause, the state's ability to regulate misdemeanor admissions, even if exercised to the fullest extent,\ncould not have prevented the situation now facing the state and does not preclude the state from obtaining some\nrelief.\nIn light of the developments outlined in the sections above and considering the present status of the prison\nsystem, the court finds that the state cannot fully comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement by 1 July\n1994 without ordering the expedited parole of large numbers of inmates that the state otherwise would not\nrelease, that the state has complied in good faith with the terms of the agreement, that the extent of the rise in\nadmissions was not foreseen, and 00 based on the legal reasoning to follow 00 that the state is entitled to some\n97 97\nrelief.\nVI. Expected Future Developments in the Prison System\nSeveral recent events are expected to have a large impact on the prison population in North Carolina. Though\ntheir effect cannot yet be ascertained with any degree of certainty, these measures are intended by the state to\nresult in the stabilization and reduction of the prison population.\nThe General Assembly enacted the Structured Sentencing Act in the recent Special Session and it will take effect\nin October of this year. The Act is intended to regulate the prison population from the \"front end\" by controlling\nadmission rates rather than by releasing prisoners pursuant to the cap, and reflects the state's interest in\nrationing prison resources 00 more serious offenders will serve longer sentences, and misdemeanants will either\n97\nbe diverted to other programs or will serve at least three months in prison. When the Act takes effect, North\nCarolina will join the majority of states by diverting most misdemeanants away from the state prison system.\nThe Department of Corrections expects both felony and misdemeanor admissions to decrease substantially\nunder structured sentencing. It is expected that probation revocations will decrease and that probationers will opt\nagainst prison more often when they face a minimum three month sentence instead of a roughly 12-day\nsentence, as they do now. As all parties concede, however, the real impact of structured sentencing cannot yet\nbe discerned.\nAlso as a result of the special legislative session held in the spring of 1994, the state has available to it an\nadditional 1,000 out-of-state contract beds, an additional 500 beds for inmates in need of substance abuse\ntreatment, and an additional 500 beds in local confinement facilities. The court accepts defendants' assertion that\n\nthe extra 500 \"efficiency beds\" funded by the session already have been occupied and accounted for. The state's\naccess to these new contract beds is dependent on availability and the state's ability to negotiate inmate\nplacement. These beds are available now and through June 1995, at which time authorization for them will\nterminate unless renewed by legislative action.\nA number of permanent prison beds already have been funded and are under construction. At the standard\noccupancy rate, the 1994-95 fiscal year system capacity is 24,136, with a prison population for that year\nprojected (by the Sentencing Commission, after the 1994 Special Session) to be 24,698. Accounting for all\nconstruction funded up through the Special Session, the Department of Corrections expects the system to have\n27,247 beds at the 50 square feet standard, system-wide, when construction is complete. At the interim levels, if\nthey were allowed in the Small units and extended system-wide where appropriate, the state would have a\n520 capacity of 31,772 beds. The state also expects to lose a number of beds either temporarily *520 due to\nrenovations or permanently due to closures.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nDisposition of this case is controlled by the Supreme Court's decision in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,\n502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), and the Fourth Circuit's decisions in Plyler v. Evatt, 846\nF.2d 208 (4th Cir.),cert. denied,488 U.S. 897, 109 S.Ct. 241, 102 L.Ed.2d 230 (1988) (Plyler I), and Plyler v.\nEvatt, 924 F.2d 1321 (4th Cir.1991) (Plyler II). The court's review is pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, which provides in part that \"[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may\nrelieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order or proceeding\" if the court determines\nthat \"it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\" The burden is on the state\ndefendants, as the parties seeking modification, to show why the Settlement Agreement should be modified.\nThe standard that the state must satisfy was set out in Rufo, wherein the Court held that \"a party seeking a\nmodification of a consent decree must establish that a significant change in facts or law warrants revision of the\ndecree and that the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at\n___, 112 S.Ct. at 765. This standard applies when the party seeks to modify \"a term of a consent decree that\narguably relates to the vindication of a constitutional right,\" id. at ___ n. 7, 112 S.Ct. at 760 n. 7, which is the\nsituation in the instant case. Because no party contends that applicable law has changed, at issue is whether a\n\"significant change in [factual] circumstances warrants revision of the decree.\" Id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 760.\nI. The State Must Show A Significant Change in Circumstances\nTo satisfy this threshold requirement, the state must show that changed circumstances make compliance with the\nSettlement Agreement substantially more onerous, or unworkable due to unforeseen obstacles, or detrimental to\nthe public interest. Id. As the Rufo Court made clear, however, \"Rule 60(b)(5) provides that a party may obtain\nrelief from a court order when `it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application,'\nnot when it is no longer convenient to live with the terms of the consent decree.\" Id. And, as Judge Phillips noted\nin dissent in Plyler I,\nA major concern in considering motions to modify injunctive decrees, whether consensual or\ncourt-imposed, is that the procedure not be used to re-examine the basis of the original decree\nrather than the equity of the modification. Care must be taken not to \"impeach\" the injunction \"in\nits application to the conditions that existed at its making\" while ostensibly considering whether to\nmodify it because the conditions have changed; courts may not properly \"reverse under the guise\nof readjusting.\"\nPlyler I, 846 F.2d at 221 (Phillips, J., dissenting) (quoting United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 119, 52\nS.Ct. 460, 464, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932)).\nThe Findings of Fact set out above make clear that since the signing of the Settlement Agreement, the state has\nexperienced a dramatic upswing in prison admissions, the full extent of which it did not foresee. These\n\nadmissions have outpaced the state's construction plan. While the state did predict that prison admissions would\nrise and therefore could be said to have \"anticipated changing conditions\" that would impact on the Agreement, it\nis the extent of those changes that was not foreseen. The state has satisfied the court that it joined in the\nSettlement Agreement in good faith and has made reasonable efforts to comply with the Agreement. Accordingly,\nthe court finds that the state did not anticipate the changes that in fact occurred.\nII. The State Must Show That The Proposed Modification is Suitably\nTailored.\nThe state cannot house the inmates being brought into the system in accord with the terms of the Settlement\n521 Agreement without overriding the population level permitted by *521 the cap and initiating a massive early\nrelease of inmates. If the state is not allowed to continue operating at least some of the Small units at the interim\nlevels, the state's other likely option for immediate relief from the pressures of the cap would be to transfer\ninmates to other units not covered by the Settlement Agreement, thereby worsening conditions at those units. To\nremedy this situation, the state proposes that the agreement be modified to allow the state to continue to house\ninmates in older dormitories at 140% of standard operating capacity, and to house inmates at new facilities at\n130%. The petition is, in part, suitably tailored to provide the relief to which the state is entitled, and for the\nreasons set out below, the petition will be allowed in part and denied in part.\nA. This Court May Grant Partial Modification.\nIt is appropriate at this juncture to address plaintiffs' argument that the court has no jurisdiction to approve only a\npart of defendants' request, but instead must flatly allow or deny the petition in its entirety. The court concludes as\na matter of law that it may allow requested modifications to the agreement if they are suitably tailored and \"upon\nsuch terms as are just,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), and reject those that are not.\nThe court's ability to grant partial modification is supported not only by the traditional powers of a court sitting in\nequity but also by binding precedent. The Supreme Court noted in Rufo that \"[t]he experience of the district and\ncircuit courts in implementing and modifying [consent] decrees has demonstrated that a flexible approach is often\nessential to achieving the goal of reform litigation.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 758. The Rufo Court made\nits observation with reference to the court's obligation to consider requests for modification, rather than actually to\ncraft an acceptable modification out of the petition offered by the state, id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 760, but that\ndecision does not preclude this court's exercise of discretion in allowing so much of the proposed modification as\nis proper.\nMore directly on point is Plyler v. Evatt, 924 F.2d 1321 (4th Cir.1991) (Plyler II), in which the Fourth Circuit Court\nof Appeals found that the district court erred by refusing to give \"any relief from the cell-space requirements at\nissue.\" Id. at 1329 (emphasis in original). The court explained that where the state is entitled to some relief, a\n\"district court must therefore set its hand to devising that form of relief which will best insure continued progress\ntoward achievement of the broad public policy objective of relieving overcrowding that underlies the cell-space\nrequirements of the decree, while accommodating the present impossibility of achieving that objective by the\noriginally intended means of constructing additional facilities on a specific timetable.\" Id. In undertaking that task,\n\"the question of what may be appropriate equitable relief from particular cell space provisions of course must\nremain a matter for the discretionary judgment of the district court.\" Id. at 1328. The Plyler court emphasized\nconsistently that \"the watchword must be flexibility,\" and the case was remanded to the district court with\ndirections to exercise flexibility in \"keeping such pressure on as is necessary to insure continued good faith\nefforts to comply while accommodating the reality of present inability to meet particular cell-space requirements.\" \nId. at 1330.\nFinally, the court's review of the petition to modify is governed by Rule 60(b), which allows a court to relieve a\nparty of full compliance with a final order \"on such terms as are just.\" In light of this authority, and because the\nprogress of institutional reform is in no way furthered by a system that affords relief only on a strategic hit-or-miss\nbasis, the court finds that it has, as a matter of law, the authority to grant or deny the petition in whole or in part.\n\nB. Standards for Modification\nAs the Rufo Court explained, the court must evaluate the proposed modification with reference to three factors.\nFirst, \"a modification must not create or perpetuate a constitutional violation.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at\n763. The modification sought by the state 00 to the extent that it seeks to utilize the new units at a capacity in\n97\n522 excess of 100% 00 would not, in light of improved *522 overall prison conditions, create or perpetuate a\n97\nconstitutional violation.\nNext, the proposed modification \"should not strive to rewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the\nconstitutional floor.\" Id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 764. As to this factor, the court finds that the conditions existing under\nthe approved modification of the newer dormitories from standard operating capacity to 125% of that number do\nnot merely conform to the constitutional floor, but instead are superior to the conditions mandated, at a minimum,\nby the Constitution. Defendants requested that the operating capacity in the new dorms be raised to 130%. This\nthe court cannot allow, because the new dormitories have been limited under the terms of the Settlement\nAgreement to 125% and the court is in no position to speculate as to whether conditions at 130% are satisfactory.\nInstitutional reform litigation by its very nature is subject to an inordinate number of uncertainties, policy shifts,\nfiscal limitations and varying other crises without the added element of modifying decrees in ways that will bring\nabout unknown effects on the parties. To eliminate all doubt, the court finds that at the present time it has no\nbasis on which to evaluate whether 130% capacity could be permitted in the new dorms and that they therefore\nmay not, at this time, be operated at that capacity.\nThe request to continue to house inmates in older facilities at 140% will be denied because to allow that\nmodification would rewrite that portion of the consent decree to conform to the constitutional floor. The state's\nown witnesses conceded, when asked the maximum percentage above standard operating capacity at which\nthey could run a safe prison, that they could not advise the court of an acceptable number above 140%. On this\nground and also for additional reasons set forth in Section D.2., infra, operation of old dorms at 140% of capacity\nwill not be allowed.\nAnd finally, with respect to the third factor, \"the public interest and `[c]onsiderations based on the allocation of\npowers within our federal system' require that the district court defer to local government administrators, who\nhave the `primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving' the problems of institutional reform, to\nresolve the intricacies of implementing a decree modification.\" Id. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 764 (quoting Board of\nEduc. of Okla. City Schs. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 238, 111 S.Ct. 630, 632, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991)). The court\nwill, as it must, leave to the state to determine the \"intricacies\" of operating the prison unit at the allowed capacity\nlevels. The discretionary decisions that must be made to ensure the state's compliance with all other aspects of\nthe Settlement Agreement remain, of course, the responsibility of the state.\nC. Balancing of the Interests\nBound up in the determination of whether modification is warranted at all, and if so in what form, is the court's\nobligation to balance the interests of the parties. The court has done so and concludes that the interests of the\nparties and the public are best served by allowing partial modification.\nIn making this assessment, the court has considered the public interest in several respects, the most obvious\nbeing the public's interest in being free from risks of increased crime brought about by the early release of\nprisoners, insofar as the release is due to overcrowding and not to some other institutional factor. As noted\nabove, the view that prison overcrowding leads to early releases, which in turn lead to the commission of crimes\nthat would have been avoided had the prisoners served the time that was excluded due to overcrowding, is\nwidely held but based largely on anecdotal evidence. Even more telling, in the court's view, is the frequent\ncoupling of this view with the argument that prisoners simply get out too early, should serve more of their\nsentences, and have lost respect for a system that cannot contain them. While each of these views has at least\nsome validity and are quite properly part of the public discourse, they do not come together to provide any kind of\ncumulative proof of \"public risk.\"\n\nSeveral of the state's witnesses, most notably Mr. Phillips, opined that early releases increase the public risk but\n523 apparently founded those views on the belief that criminals *523 have lost respect for imprisonment as a sanction\nand opt for prison time rather than some lesser form of supervision because they know their actual time in prison\nwill be significantly shorter than that to which they were sentenced. This may well be true, but the fact remains\nthat prisoners get out of prison early not only because of cap-mandated \"emergency releases\" but also because\nof good time, gain time, mandatory 90 day releases, 260 day releases, and community service parole, all of\nwhich are either sanctioned or mandated by the state. The state has not shown that the housing levels allowed\nunder this Order will cause a massive early release that will result in the release of any individuals who are\nconsidered to be a risk to the public welfare.\nThe public, of course, has other interests as well, including a strong interest in having the state abide by the\nterms of agreements made on its behalf. It is no small matter for the state to seek relief from the enforcement of a\nbinding legal agreement. Further, the public has an interest in having its institutions run in a fiscally responsible\nway. Even if the state has sufficient funds to build thousands of new prison beds, as it conceivably might in light\nof the state's relative prosperity this year, the public is entitled to have the public funds directed to the most\nimportant state projects and to reap the fullest benefit from the dollars spent. As the Rufo Court recognized, a\nconsent judgment or settlement agreement has a substantial \"impact on the public's right to sound and efficient\noperation of its institutions.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at ___, 112 S.Ct. at 759 (quoting Heath v. De Courcy, 888 F.2d 1105,\n1109 (6th Cir.1989)). In this case, as to the new units, the public interest is best served by allowing those units to\nbe managed safely, humanely, and efficiently at 125% of SOC.\nD. The Agreement will be Modified\nThe court finds that the state's petition to modify the Agreement to allow the interim operating capacity to\ncontinue in effect is suitably tailored in part. Specifically, as to the newer dorms, the petition to modify will be\nallowed, but only to the extent of 125% of capacity as has been in effect under the IOC. The increase to 130%\nwould mean an additional 3 or 4 inmates in a typical 50-inmate dorm and, as noted above, the court will not order\n[9]\na modification whose effect remains untested.  As to the older dorms, the petition will be denied.\n1. The Newer Dorms\nThe newer dorms do not have center rows of bunk beds and provide a fairly spacious environment while\nsimultaneously enabling the state to house more inmates. An increase to 125% of SOC in the newer dorms\nwould not present any appreciable increased risk to inmates or significantly impact on any other terms of the\nsettlement agreement. Taking into account the cumulative effect of all of the improvements to the prison system,\nthe inmates housed in these newer dorms (assuming no middle row of bunks) at interim operating capacity are\nreceiving almost all of the benefit of their bargain and are being housed in conditions that substantially surpass\nthe minimum standards mandated by the constitution.\n2. The Older Dorms\nThe state's request is not suitably tailored as to the older dorms. Under the standard configuration in the older\ndorms, they include a center row of bunks. This arrangement, taken in connection with all other aspects of the\nprison dormitory environment, brings about increased risks for inmates and guards alike. The center row blocks\nvision and reduces the space between bunks to as little as 33\". The lack of a clear line of vision through the\ndorms was a very important factor in the initial action because it contributed in large part to the ease with which\n524 inmates could assault each other. As noted, the court viewed a representative unit in this *524 configuration and\nconcludes that although it was acceptable for the interim period, it must not be perpetuated. For the foregoing\nreasons, the court finds that continued use of the center bunks presents sufficient risks to weigh against the\nstate's proposal to continue to house inmates at interim levels in the dorms whose interim capacity levels\nnecessitated the use of center bunks. This decision is based on the court's observation of the conditions in the\n\nold dorm at the Columbus unit and the particular dimensions of the unit and the way in which the bunks were\narranged. The record is not clear whether there are other older units of different dimensions or of different bunk\narrangement that would exceed 100% of SOC and still meet the Rufo standard.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Petition to Modify the Settlement Agreement to allow defendants to house inmates\nin the newer dorms at 130% of capacity is DENIED; however, the Settlement Agreement is MODIFIED to allow\ndefendants to house inmates in the newer dorms at 125% of capacity. This modification is effective immediately.\nThe petition to modify the Settlement Agreement to allow defendants to house inmates in the older dorms at\n140% of capacity is DENIED. However, defendants will be allowed an additional thirty days, until 1 August 1994,\nwithin which to comply with the Settlement Agreement in this respect.\n[1] Percent of \"capacity\" refers to the 50 square foot per inmate capacity.\n[2] For practical purposes, the court generally will refer to defendants as \"the state.\" In so doing, the court intends\nto reference the named defendants and the entities that they represent, and particularly the Department of\nCorrections.\n[3] Specifically, the Settlement Committee consisted of James Trotter and Marvin Dorman on behalf of Governor\nJim Martin, state Representatives Ann Barnes, Billy Watkins, and Joe Hackney for various state legislative\ncommittees, Dan Blue for Speaker of the House Liston Ramsey, John McMillan for Lieutenant Governor Bob\nJordan, and Joseph Hamilton for Secretary of Correction Aaron Johnson. Lucien Capone, III and Tiare Smiley\nwere counsel for the Committee.\n[4] Hamilton's figures showed a 5% increase in felon admissions in 1986 and a 6% felon admissions increase in\n1987.\n[5] Because the state conducts thousands of intrastate prisoner transfers every year, prisoners are subjected to\nand aware of the varying standards of prison life in the different units. Prisoners develop preferences and\ncomplain about those units that do not measure up to the perceived quality of others. Grievances of this sort\npromote inmate dissatisfaction and unrest, and could be alleviated or minimized by standardized prison\nconditions.\n[6] Counsel and the prison superintendents received approximately one hour's notice.\n[7] The SOC dorm visited by the court had twenty-five double bunks or a 50-inmate capacity, while the IOC dorm,\nthough equal in size, had thirty-one double bunks or 62-inmate capacity.\n[8] Community Service Parole (\"CSP\") is available to inmates serving sentences of six months or more after they\nhave served one-fourth of their sentences, less allowances for good or gain time credit. Inmates sentenced for\nserious sex offenses, kidnapping, or drug trafficking are not eligible for CSP.\n[9] For purposes of illustration, a 50 inmate dorm providing 50 square feet for each inmate has 2500 square feet.\nOperating at 125% of capacity would mean that 62 inmates would have 40.33 square feet each. Operating at\n130% of capacity would mean that 65 inmates would have 38.46 square feet each. And, operating at 140% of\ncapacity would mean that 70 inmates would have 35.72 square feet each. As a matter of fact, most of the dorms\nare not evenly divisible by 50 square feet.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
