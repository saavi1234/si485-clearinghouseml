      "title": "Exhibit B: Model for Enhanced Mental Health System",
      "text": "EXHIBIT B\nMOOEL  FOR ENHANCED MENTAL HEALTH  SYSTEM\nA.  SCOPE OF ENHANCED MENTAL HEALTH  SERVICES:\nThis  Plan  is  a  comprehensive  program  developed  to  address  the\nmental health needs of incarcerated  individuals who fall under  the\nauspices of the New Jersey Department of Corrections  (\"DOC\").  This\nPlan,  including the new units, will be designed to accommodate  all\ntypes of mentally ill inmates, including the subset of mentally ill\ninmates  who  exhibit  aggressive  tendencies.  The  Plan  has  seven\nmajor  components:\n(1)  Reception  Evaluations\n(2)  Stabilization Units,  (SU)\n(3)  Residential  Treatment Units,  (RTU)\n(4)  Transitional  Care Units,  (TCU)\n(5)  Outpatient  Care,\n(6)  Inpatient  psychiatric  care,  and\n(7)  Construction\nThe DOC has in place at all of its facilities a policy on the\nInvoluntary  Administration  of  Psychotropic  Medication.  This\npolicy,  combined  with  the  establishment  of  Stabilization  Units,\nResidential  Treatment  Units  and  Transition  Care  Units  places  the\nDOC  in  a  position  to  more  effectively  manage  and  treat  those\ninmates who suffer  from mental  illness.\nD.M. v. Terhune\nPC-NJ-001-009\n\n1.  RECEPTION EVALUATIONS\nOne important factor is how the DOC will track inmates with\nmental  illness  to  ensure  that  they  receive  the  mental  health\nservices they need.  This also includes discharge planning upon\nrelease from the DOC.  An important aspect of this tracking system\nis the early identification and intervention of those inmates who\nsuffer from mental illness.  Enhanced evaluation services for the\nearly identification of mental illness and suicidal behavior with\nquick access to intervention is necessary.\nReception evaluations v/ill be psychological evaluations that\nwill address the DOC's needs in two ways.  The first goal of these\nevaluations  will  be  to provide  a comprehensive  history  of  the\ninmate's mental health along with treatment recommendations.  The\nsecond  goal  of  these  evaluations  will  be  to  provide  the\nClassification  Committee  with  useful  information  regarding  the\ninmate's appropriateness  for custody status and any specialized\ntreatment that would benefit the inmate while incarcerated.\nThese reception evaluations will be completed within 72 hours\nof the inmate arriving at a reception facility.  It is noted that\nnursing will be required to complete a nursing assessment, which\nwill  include a brief mental health assessment, to be  conducted\nimmediately upon arrival  (in no cases longer than 4 hours after\narrival)  at  a  reception  facility.  When  nursing  identifies  an\ninmate with a history of mental illness or suicidal intention, an\nimmediate referral will be made to mental health.  This referral\nwill include a written assessment along with verbal communication\n- 2 -\n\nto the lead psychologist.  If the nursing assessment is conducted\nafter hours, the on-call psychiatrist will be contacted.\nIf placement on a SU or RTU is warranted, nursing and mental\nhealth  will  make  the  necessary  arrangements  to  effectuate  a\ntransfer  to an appropriate  unit.  When an  inmate who has been\nidentified at Central Reception & Assignment Facility (\"CRAF\") as\nbeing  a  \"Special  Needs\"  inmate  is  transferred  to  his  parent\ninstitution, the lead psychologist at CRAF will contact the lead\npsychologist  at  the  receiving  institution  and  inform  the\npsychologist of the transfer.  This will ensure continuity of care.\nReception Staff\nStaff to complete evaluations should be sufficient enough so\nthat the mental health staff  (psychologists) are not completing\nmore than 15 evaluations per eight hour day.  Additional Social\nWorker staff will be needed to provide the on-going treatment needs\nof inmates housed in reception facilities.\n2,  STABILIZATION UNITS\nStabilization  Units  (SU)  for  psychiatric/psychological\nemergencies will be established at Northern State Prison (\"NSP\"),\nNew  Jersey  State  Prison  (\"NJSP\"),  and  Edna  Mahan  Correctional\nFacility for Women (\"EMCFW\").  These units will be regionalized to\nprovide coverage for all 14 DOC facilities.\nThe goal of these units will be to provide short terra (3 - 10\ndays),  intensive  mental  health  care  to  reduce  acute  symptoms,\n- 3 -\n\nstabilize  the  inmate  or  transfer  the  inmate  to  the  Forensic\nPsychiatric Hospital  (\"FPH\").  These units will be established so\nas to provide 24 hour nursing coverage.  Psychiatric coverage will\nbe on call 24 hours a day.\nSuicide Watch Procedures will happen on these units when it is\ndeemed that the inmate cannot be managed on his/her regular housing\nunit.\nA.  Bed Space\nBed space allocated for Stabilization Units will need to be\nfluid and flexible enough to expand and collapse as inmate needs\nvary.  The institutions outlined below offer the most flexibility\nwith regard to housing space availability.\nI.  New Jersey State Prison\nNJSP will have access to 16 beds for females and 48 beds for\nmales.  Female inmates will be housed on 1GG, which has 16 beds\navailable.  It  is  likely  that  not  all  of  these  beds  will  be\nutilized at the same time.  Bed space that is not being utilized\nfor SU beds will be used as transitional housing for discharge from\nthe SU.\nMale inmates will be housed in the South Compound at NSJP.\nThese  housing  units  are  set  up  in  48  bed  units  that  can  be\nseparated into two 24 bed units.  This flexibility will allow the\nDOC to designate one of these 24 bed units as a SU and the other to\n- 4 -\n\nserve as an overflow unit if needed.  It will also make expansion\nof SU easier in the future.\nII.  Northern State Prison\nNSP has a 30 bed unit adjacent to the hospital area that will\nbe designated as an SU.  It is a two-tiered unit that will also\nafford flexible housing.  It is reasonable to assume that at least\n15 of these beds will be utilized at any one time.  The cells on\nthe first tier would be designated as SU cells.  The cells on the\nsecond  tier would  be used  for either  SU cells or  transitional\nhousing cells for mentally ill offenders.\nIII. Edna Mahan Correctional Facility\nEMCFW will need to establish a small SU or two or three cells.\nThese cells would be holding cells used prior to the inmate being\ntransferred to NJSP's SU for females.\nB.  Treatment Review Committee\nEach SU will establish a Treatment Review Committee which will\nbe comprised of the treating psychiatrist, treating psychologist,\nnurse for the unit and correction officer representative.  This\ncommittee will be responsible for directing an inmate's treatment\nwhile on the unit and discharge from the unit.\n- 5 -\n\nCriteria for Admission tn a an\n(1)  Suicidal  thought  or  other  indicators  of  imminent  self\ninjurious behavior;\n(2)  Exhibition of signs of emotional  instability;\n(3)  Abrupt behavioral changes in behavior that require close\nmonitoring;\n(4)  Exhibition of behavior that is not appropriate  for the\ninmate's  regular  housing  unit  which  may  be  an  indication  of\nunderlying emotional disturbance;\n(5)  Psychological/Psychiatric  decompensation  due  to\nmedication non-compliance;\n(6)  Inmate is in need of Suicide Watch and it would best be\naccomplished on a SU rather than the inmate's regular housing unit.\nProfessional  staff will clinically drive admission to a SU.\nAll inter-institutional transfers into a SU will have the inmate's\nMedical/Dental  record accompany the inmate to the SU.  A  nursing\nevaluation will be completed within 1 hour of placement of a SU.\nNursing assessment will include relevant medical, mental health and\nmedication issues.  After placement on the SU, the RN assigned to\nthe  SU  will  contact  the  psychiatrist  and  obtain  all  necessary\norders for medications, clothing articles, etc.  The order will be\ndocumented in the inmate's Medical/Dental record.\nA psychiatric evaluation will be completed within 24 hours of\nplacement  on  a  SU.  A  comprehensive  treatment  plan  will  be\nformulated and documented within 48 hours of placement on the SU.\n- 6 -\n\nThis treatment plan will clearly outline relevant clinical issues\nand proposed treatment modalities to ameliorate the current crisis.\nAfter hours placements will be done with the approval of the\non-call Administrator.\np.  Treatment Services While on the SU\nNursing coverage will be 24 hours a day.  At a minimum, while\non the SU, the inmate will be seen daily by the psychiatrist and\nthe psychologist  (Monday - Saturday).  Treatment will center on\nthose issues generated by the treatment plan.  The primary mode of\ntreatment will be individual psychotherapy.  Mental health coverage\nwill be Monday - Friday, 9 a.m. - 8 p.m.  Saturday coverage will\ninclude 8 hours by mental health staff.\nE.  Discharge from a SU\nThe Treatment Review Committee will determine when the inmate\nis sufficiently stabilized to be either returned to his/her regular\nhousing unit or a Residential Treatment Unit.  Upon discharge, the\nTreatment Review Committee will outline additional mental health or\nmedical  services  that  are  to  be  provided  to  the  inmate  upon\ndischarge from the SU.  These finding will be documented in the\ninmate's Medical/Dental  record.  The Treatment Review Committee\nchairperson  will  be  responsible  for  notifying  the  lead  mental\nhealth  staff person of the  facility  where the  inmate  is to be\ntransferred of the relevant clinical issues.\n- 7 -\n\nInmates returned  from FPH will be placed on a SU and then\ndischarged  to  a  Residential  Treatment  Unit  when  clinically\nappropriate.\nStaff\nPsychiatrists 1 (FTE): 35 inmates\nPsychologists 1 (FTE): 50 inmates\nLicensed Clinical Social Worker 1 (FTE): 25 inmates\nPsychiatric nurse per unit: One nurse first shift  (7 days per\nweek)\nTwo Psychiatric nurses on second shift Monday - Friday\nOne Psychiatric nurse on second shift for both Saturday and\nSunday\nRN nursing staff coverage per unit  (1 FTE) for third shift\nwhen psychiatric nurses are relieved.\nTotal possible beds: 97\n3 .  RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT UNITS AND TRANSITIONAL CARE UNITS\nThe Residential Treatment Units and Transitional Care Units\n(step-down) share similar goals.  Their objective is to stabilize,\nsupport  and  ensure positive  reintegration of the  inmate  into a\nregular housing unit.  On these units, there will be intensive,\nmulti disciplinary programming available to the inmates.  Admission\n- 8 -\n\nto  and  discharge  from  these  units  will  be  based  on  clinical\ndecisions, supported  by documentation  in the medical  record.\nA.  Goftls of Residential  Treatment  Units  (RTU)\nThe Residential Treatment Units will have two main objectives:\n(1)  further  stabilization  of  the  inmate  after  the  \"crisis\"  has\npassed, and  (2) provide meaningful programming aimed at aiding  the\ninmate's  adjustment  to  general  population  housing.  It  is\nreasonable  to expect  that some of these  inmates may never  develop\nthe  coping  skills  necessary  to adjust  to- general  population  and,\ntherefore, may never transfer out of an RTU.\nB.  Goals of Transitional  Care Unit  (TCU)\nTCU will be a designation utilized  for those  inmates who are\nhigher  functioning  and  who  have  the  potential  to  adjust  to  the\ngeneral population housing.  This unit will allow these inmates  to\nmake a gradual  adjustment  to general  population.\nCriteria  for Admission  to an RTU or  TCU\nAdmissions  determinations  will  be  directed  by mental  health\nstaff using the following  criteria.\n(1)  Discharge  from a SU\n(2)  Chronic mental  illness with a poor adjustment  to general\npopulation\n(3)  Abrupt  behavioral  change,  but  not  severe  enough  to\nwarrant  Suicide Watch  Procedures\n- 9 -\n\n(4)  Vague suicidal ideation  (not actively self-injurious)\nD.  Programming Services.\nWithin 24 hours of placement on an RTU, nursing staff will\ncomplete a nursing assessment, documenting relevant findings on the\ninmate's Mental/Dental record.  Within 48 hours of placement on an\nRTU,  the  inmate  will  be  interviewed  by  the  psychiatrist  and\npsychologist and have a treatment plan developed outlining short-\nterm and long-term treatment goals.  The treatment plan will also\nrecommend appropriate programming.  A day treatment program model\nwill be utilized.  The program staff will be multi disciplinary in\nnature  (psychiatric  nurses,  teachers,  recreation  staff  and\noccupational therapists) .  Program will be provided 8 a.m. - 8 p.m.\nMonday through Friday and 8 hours on Saturday and Sunday. Staff\nshould be scheduled in such a way as to provide on site coverage by\nat least one mental health worker per unit, seven days a week.  The\ninmate assigned to one of these units will be programmed with as\nmuch out of cell time as is clinically directed by the treatment\nplan.\nE.  Location of Units\n1.  New Jersey State Prison:  NJSP will have two 48 bed units\ndedicated as an RTU.  These units will ideally be in the South\nCompound and as close to the SU as is possible.\n2.  Northern State Prison:  NSP will have two 40 bed units.\n- 10 -\n\n3.  Southwonds State Pri son• SWSP  will  house  127 inmates.\nThese beds will be utilized by \"higher functioning\" inmates with\nmental illness who are programming at a higher level and who are\nmore capable of making a suitable adjustment to general population.\nIt is likely that due to the size of this unit there will be a\nmixture of inmates with regard to their stability.  SWSP's program\nwill be somewhat more flexible than NSP's or NSJP's because SWSP is\nclassified as a Medium Security facility.\n4.  Edna Mahan Correctional Facility:  EMCFW  will  have  15\nbeds designated as a RTU.  These beds will be utilized for inmates\nwho can be managed at EMCFW.  Those inmates who cannot be managed\nwithin  the  confines  of  EMCFW  will  be  transferred  to NJSP  for\nassignment in their RTU.\nF_».  Staff\nPsychiatrists 1 (FTE): 75 inmates\nPsychologists 1 (FTE): 30 inmates\nLicensed Clinical Social Worker 1 (FTE): 25 inmates\nOccupational Therapists 1 (FTE): 30 inmates\nPsychiatric nurse per unit: One nurse first shift (7 days per\nweek)\nTwo Psychiatric nurses on second shift Monday - Friday\nOne Psychiatric nurse on second shift for both Saturday and\nSunday\n- 11 -\n\nRN nursing staff coverage per unit  (1 FTE) for third shift\nwhen psychiatric nurses are relieved.\nIn addition, SWSP will add an extra RN on each shift  (7 days\nper week) due to the population of this unit.\nTotal possible beds: 318\nG.  Discharge Procedures\nEvery  inmate  on  an  RTU  or  TCU  will  be  reviewed  by  the\nTreatment  Review  Committee  at  least  monthly  to  document  the\ninmate's progress towards treatment plan goals.  These reviews will\nbe documented  in the  inmate's Medical/Dental  record.  When the\ncommittee feels that the inmate has maximized treatment benefit a\nrecommendation  will  be  made  to  have  the  inmate  returned  to a\nregular housing population unit.\nOnce  discharged  from  this  unit,  the  chairperson  of  the\nTreatment Review Committee will be responsible for contacting the\nlead psychologist of the institution the inmate will be transferred\nto so as to ensure continuity of care.\nOUTPATIENT SERVICES\nOut patient  services need  to be sufficient  enough so that\ninmates discharged from RTU's will have ample programming available\nto them in general  population, as well as having  enough  staff\navailable  to provide mental health services to the rest of the\n- 12 -\n\ngeneral population of inmates who may not suffer from a diagnosable\nmental illness.  The ratios below reflect this intention.  This\nwill include mental health rounds in the Administrative Segregation\nUnits.  These rounds will be scheduled to ensure that every inmate\nin Administrative Segregation is seen at least once every 10 days\nby a mental health professional.\nThe  staff  below  does  not  include  psychological  staff  to\ncomplete Psychological Evaluations for the N.J. State Parole Board\nor for the Institutional Classification Committees.\nStaff\n1 FTE Psychiatry: 125 inmates on case load\n1 FTE Psychologist or Licensed Social Worker: 50 inmates on\ncase load\n5.  INPATIENT SERVICES\nInpatient  Psychiatric  Care  will  continued  to  be  provided\nthrough the civil commitment process at FPH.\n§,  TRAINING\nA.  Correction Officer Training\nCorrection Officer staff will need enhanced training.  This\nwill involve 2 different focuses.  The first will be to train every\nofficer on the early warning signs of mental illness and how it can\nbe manifested  in a correctional environment.  This will be very\nsimilar  to what  the  recruits  receive  at  the Correction  Officer\n- 13 -\n\nTraining Academy.  Every Officer should have yearly training as a\nrefresher on mental health issues.  It is conceivable that a 3 or\n4  year  cycle of  training  can be established  so that  it  is not\nrepetitive.\nThe second focus involves those officer and supervisory staff\nwho will  be  responsible  for working on the SU and RTU housing\nunits.  This training will need to be more involved and extensive\nthan that given to the corrections officer who is not working on\none of these units.  Training components will be: understanding\nmental  illness,  the  different  types  of- mental  illness, how  to\nmanage a mentally ill inmate, disciplinary procedures for mentally\nill inmates when they are housed on SU and RTU, crisis intervention\nstrategies, early warning signs of suicide, stress management and\ntraining on new policies and procedures that will be generated due\nto the creation of these units.\nAt a minimum, all corrections officers should receive  4 -7\nhours of mental health training per year.  An additional 7 hours is\nappropriate for those officers who are working on the SU and RTU.\nB.  Other Staff Training\nInternal Affairs investigators will need training similar to\ncorrection officer training with a special focus on investigating\na  charge  or  other  serious  incident  given  an  inmate•s  mental\nillness.\nDisciplinary  Hearing Officers will need additional  and on-\ngoing training.\n- 14 -\n\nAdministrators  and  their  staff  will  also  need  on-going\ntraining on managing the mentally ill inmate.\nThe extensiveness of this training is justifiable because the\nliterature  in  this  area  indicates  that  these  types  of  units\nultimately reduce disciplinary problems and staff assaults.  There\nare also less emergencies because staff have a better awareness of\ninmates1  problems  and  are  able  to  step  in quicker  to  resolve\npotential  problems.  Better-trained  staff should translate  into\nquicker identification of potential problems and therefore quicker\nintervention by mental health staff.\n2*.  CONSTRUCTION\nRenovations  to  EMCFWs  C  Cottage  may  be  necessary.\nAnticipated renovations include security to allow programming in\nthe basement of C Cottage along with new windows in this cottage to\nallow for better airflow.  Modifications to existing beds will also\nbe necessary  to prevent  suicide attempts.  New security doors,\ncameras and additional correction officer staff may be needed to\nensure an adequate treatment program.\nNSP could benefit from some modification to the SU.  It would\nmake sense to convert 2 cells in this unit to be able to handle\nClose Watch cases.  These modifications can include cameras, and\ncell  modification  in  minimize  suicidal  acting  out.  Minor\nmodifications to existing space to make it more user friendly to\ntreatment staff is also needed.  On the RTU, some additional caging\n- 15 -\n\nmay be needed to allow more programming opportunities for inmates\non these units.\nSWSP may need to convert 2 to 3 cells on the first tier to be\nable to provide for inmates on Close Watch Procedures on the RTU.\nNJSP and SWSP could benefit from caged areas to allow for more\nprogram  space.  It  is  not  believed  that  there  will  be  major\nconstruction issues at these 2 facilities.\nThe DOC will provide facilities for confidential mental health\ntreatment  of  inmates  who  require  such  services.  Confidential\nsettings  for  mental  health  treatment  will  be  created  in\nadministrative segregation units, stabilization units, residential\ntreatment units and transitional care units.\n- 16 -",

Murphy, Kalison, McBride & Jackson,\nLiberty Corner, NJ, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nHUGHES, United States Magistrate Judge.\nThis matter comes before this Court pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 23(e) for approval of a proposed settlement\nagreement (\"the Settlement\") entered into by the Plaintiffs and Defendants. The Court has considered the written\nsubmissions of the parties, 350 responses to the Settlement by certain members of the class, the record of the\nfairness hearing, held on July 6, 1999, and the Settlement itself.\nThe parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the United States Magistrate Judge, for all purposes, pursuant to\n28 U.S.C.A. § 636 and FED.R.CIV.P. 73.\nI. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs allege civil rights violations, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 and violations of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.A. § 12132. Specifically, Plaintiffs, a group of inmates with mental disorders in\nthe New Jersey State Prison system, assert that they have been unlawfully denied treatment and medication for\ntheir mental disorders. Plaintiffs contend that the deprivation of medical treatment violates their right against cruel\nand unusual punishment as well as their right to be free from discrimination for their disabilities pursuant to the\nADA. Defendants, to the contrary, contend that Plaintiffs' mental health treatment is adequate and that it complies\nwith the United States Constitution and the ADA.\nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn April 11, 1996, a class action complaint was filed against the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections and various other officials in the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). On November 20, 1996, the\nCourt granted Plaintiffs' motion for certification of a class action, pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 23.\nOn July 18, 1997, a motion was granted allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The amended complaint\njoined Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (\"CMS\"), and Correctional Behavioral Services, Inc. (\"CBS\"), as co-\ndefendants. CBS and CMS are private contractors engaged by the state of New Jersey to provide mental health\nservices to inmates.\n\nCBS, CMS, and the DOC moved for summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment\nthereafter. The summary judgement motions were dismissed as moot on April 29, 1999, after the parties agreed\nto settle this matter.\n403 *403 Discovery related to this case has been immense, leading to the production of more than 12,000 pages of\ndocuments. In addition, the parties took over thirty depositions and conducted three extensive inspections of the\nNew Jersey prisons.\nIntense settlement negotiations and conferences began in November of 1998 and continued through March of\n1999. The result of these conferences and negotiations was the Settlement. The Court conducted a fairness\nhearing on July 6, 1999, and the Court hereby grants final approval of this Settlement.\n[2]\nIII. SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nThe Settlement consists of five major parts: (1) amendments to the DOC disciplinary regulations, (2) a mental\nhealth treatment plan, (3) a statement on new policies and procedures by the DOC, (4) the funding, monitoring\nand enforcement of the Settlement, and (5) liability of Defendants. Separate and apart from the Settlement, the\nparties entered into an agreement on attorneys fees and costs, but only after the Settlement benefitting the\ninmates had been agreed upon. The following discussion in this section will summarize each part of the\nSettlement and the fee agreement.\nA. Amendments to the DOC Disciplinary Regulations\nThe DOC agreed to change parts of its disciplinary regulations. Under the new regulations, all prisoners with\npending disciplinary charges will have their names given to the mental health staff before their disciplinary\nhearing. The mental health staff will inform the disciplinary hearing officer whether the individual charged is\nundergoing mental health treatment.\nThe hearing officer, based on all the information available to him, will decide whether or not to request a\npsychological or psychiatric evaluation of the prisoner. The hearing officer will consider all the information,\nincluding the evaluation, before deciding whether punishment will be imposed on the prisoner. Instead of, or in\naddition to, the sanctions imposed on the prisoner, the hearing officer may also refer a mentally ill prisoner to the\nmental health unit for appropriate care and treatment.\nAdditionally, if a prisoner is confined in disciplinary detention, and suffers a deterioration on his or her mental\nhealth status, the mental health staff will refer the matter to the administrator of the prison where the inmate is\nheld. The Special Administrative Segregation Review Committee shall release the prisoner from Administrative\nSegregation if the prisoner has a history of mental illness and the Committee decides that continued confinement\nin the unit would be harmful to the prisoner's mental health.\nB. Plan for Mental Health Treatment\nAll new prisoners will receive a mental health assessment within 72 hours of arrival. The DOC will ensure that\nthere is an adequate number of staff to serve the entire prison population. Correction officers, internal affairs\ninvestigators, disciplinary hearing officers and administrators will receive additional training about mental illness\nand dealing with mentally ill prisoners.\nThe DOC will create three Stabilization Units (\"SU\"), for the purpose of treating mentally ill prisoners experiencing\na mental health crisis. These units will be located at Northern State Prison, New Jersey State Prison, and the\nEdna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women. The DOC will also create Residential Treatment Units (\"RTU\"), and\nTraditional Care Units (\"TCU\"). After discharge from the SU, the RTU will provide a structured and supportive\n404 environment for mentally ill *404 prisoners unable, due to their illness, to be transferred to the general population.\n\nThe TCU will help prisoners with less severe mental illness to make a gradual adjustment to the general\npopulation. The decision about placing prisoners in these units will be determined by the mental health staff.\nC. Policies and Procedures\nThe DOC agrees to review or create five general types of policies and procedures in order to implement the\nSettlement: (1) any policies and procedures consistent with the goals of the plan and the amendments to the\ndisciplinary regulations; (2) involuntary medication policies and procedures, including those describing the\ndifference between emergency and non-emergency involuntary medication; (3) polices and procedures on the\nuse of force situations involving class members which provide for input from the mental health staff; (4)\nmedication policy and procedures regarding medication administration, medication prescription, management of\nmedication, inmate non-compliance and formulary lists; and (5) discharge planning for class members in\nanticipation of their release from DOC facilities with minimum requirements, as outlined in the Settlement, that\nmust be met.\nDefendants will submit the new or revised policies and procedures to the Monitor. Additionally, Defendants agree\nto implement these policies and procedures to ensure continued compliance with the Settlement.\nD. Funding, Monitoring and Enforcement\nThe Settlement requires that enough funding must be allocated by the State of New Jersey to implement this\nprogram through the Fiscal Year 2000. The Governor recommended, and the New Jersey Legislature approved\n$16,000,000 to implement the Settlement. The Commissioner of the Department of Corrections certifies that\n$16,000,000 is sufficient to implement the Settlement. Therefore, the Court finds that funding is available to\nimplement the program.\nDr. Raymond F. Patterson, a forensic psychiatrist, will be appointed as an independent mental health expert to\noversee Defendants' compliance. Dr. Patterson has a distinguished career in psychiatry and correctional\nservices. (See Class Counsel Decl., Exhibit A, Patterson Curriculum Vitae (\"Patterson C.V.\").) He graduated from\nNorthwestern University in 1973 and went on to receive his M.D. from Howard University College of Medicine in\n1977. (See Patterson C.V.) In medical school, Dr. Patterson received the National Medical Fellowship\nIncorporated Scholarship Clinical Psychiatry Award. (See id.) His numerous professional awards include the\nMental Hygiene Administration Certificate of Appreciation for Risk Management/Quality Assessment Program,\nand the Department of Human Services Distinguished Service Award; both of which were awarded in October\n1992. (See id.) Presently, Dr. Patterson is serving as the Director of Forensic Services for the Commission on\nMental Health Services in Washington, D.C. (See id.) From May 1997 until February 1998, he worked as the\nChief Psychiatrist for the Department of Public Safety & Correctional Services in Baltimore, Maryland. (See id.) In\naddition, Dr. Patterson is currently on staff as an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the following schools:\nHoward University College of Medicine, the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at University of Maryland\nSchool of Medicine, and Georgetown University Department of Psychiatry. (See id.) Dr. Patterson has also\nauthored numerous papers on mental health and spoken to various professional groups across the country on\nthis topic.\nDr. Patterson will inspect the DOC facilities four times a year. He will be able to interview prisoners and staff\n405 during his inspection. After each inspection, Dr. Patterson will write a report explaining *405 whether the DOC has\nsubstantially complied with the Settlement. Dr. Patterson's report will be confidential, except for copies to the\nmedical and mental health service providers under contract with the DOC, Defendants, counsel to the Plaintiffs,\nand any former employee witnesses, outside non-party consultants, or experts listed in the Settlement. The\ninmates will not have access to the report. If the DOC has not substantially complied with the Settlement, it has a\nlimited number of chances to correct the problem. Once the DOC is in full compliance for twelve continuous\nmonths, then the Settlement will terminate.\n\nPrisoners concerned with their mental health care may submit their grievances directly to the Director of Health\nServices Unit or to the Plaintiff class counsel, who will then forward these concerns to Dr. Patterson, as well as to\nthe contractors providing medical and health services.\nThe Plaintiffs, only through class counsel, may sue to enforce this agreement in New Jersey State Court. No\nother individual or group of prisoners may sue to enforce this agreement, and Plaintiffs' counsel may not bring\nsuch a suit unless Dr. Patterson finds that the DOC is not in compliance with the Settlement.\nE. Liability\nThis Settlement is an agreement between Plaintiffs and the DOC. The DOC makes no admission of liability as to\nthe Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs agree to dismiss their claims against the DOC, CMS and CBS with prejudice. All\ncross-claims between Defendants will be dismissed with prejudice.\nF. Attorneys Fees and Costs\nAs part of this agreement, the DOC will pay the Plaintiff class counsel a total of $1,220,000, in resolution of all\nattorneys fees and costs incurred by Plaintiffs' counsel in litigating this case. Plaintiffs' counsel normal rate for\nfees and costs would have amounted to more than $3,900,000. Since counsel undertook the representation on a \npro bono basis, and since their primary objective was the improvement of mental health care for prisoners, they\nagreed to cut their costs over 67% and accept a lower amount. Significantly, this agreement was reached after\nthe substantive settlement was agreed upon.\nIV. NOTICE TO CLASS\nOn May 15, 1999, this Court signed an order requiring distribution of the notice of the proposed Settlement to all\nclass members. Approximately 2,455 notices were distributed to the class. The notice contained a copy of the\nSettlement, a plain language summary in English and Spanish, and a comment sheet, all of which were enclosed\ninto a sealed envelope. The class members were required to have all comments postmarked by June 25, 1999.\nThe Court, on its own initiative, decided to consider any comment received by July 28, 1999. (Only two additional\ncomments were received).\nThe Court determined that this distribution of the proposed settlement and comment sheets was the most\nappropriate means for providing notice to the class members in accordance with the FED. R.CIV.P. 23(e).\n[3]\nV. RESPONSE OF CLASS\nThe members of the Plaintiff class submitted comments in response to the Settlement. As a result, class counsel\n406 received comments from 345 inmate class members. (See Sandra L. Cobden, Esquire letter, *406 dated July 1,\n1999 (\"Cobden's July letter\").) The Court directly received 14 responses, of which 9 were duplicates of responses\nsent to class counsel. A total of 350 different responses were received and read. After reviewing the inmate\nresponses and class counsel's assessment of the comments, the Court is satisfied that, on balance, the class\nmembers support the Settlement.\nOf the 350 responses, 270 prisoners submitted responses relevant to the issues raised by this action. The other\n80 comments raised general complaints concerning treatment by mental health, correctional, and disciplinary\npersonnel; asked for a referral; or sought clarifications regarding the Settlement. (See Cobden's July letter at n.\n1.) Of the 270 comments addressing this action, 170 responses addressed the terms of the Settlement. Of those\n170 letters, 89 prisoners indicated that they approved of the Settlement. Notably, 15 of those 89 prisoners who\napproved of the Settlement also expressed concerns or criticism regarding particular provisions. (See id. at 2, n.\n2.)\n\nA. Objections to the Settlement Agreement\nEighty-one responses objected to the Settlement. (See Declaration of Sandra L. Cobden and Patricia Perlmutter\n(\"Class Counsel Decl.\") at 5.) The objections to the Settlement raised the following issues: (1) the relief sought\nwas merely injunctive; (2) the Settlement did not provide for monetary relief; (3) inmates protested as to their\ninclusion in the class; (4) inmates expressed their concern that the Settlement will not be enforced; (5) the\nSettlement failed to modify the parole process for mentally ill prisoners; (6) the Settlement did not include a\nprovision for retroactive relief for prisoners who lost commutation (\"good time\") credits and/or were sanctioned\nwith administrative segregation based on behavior predating the Settlement which was a product of their mental\nillness; (7) the scope of relief provided under the Settlement to prisoners being released was inadequate; (8)\ncriticism of class counsel's fee award; (9) a need for heightened security measures for class members; (10) the\ndangers of forced medication; (11) a need for bilingual mental health clinicians. Many responses addressed more\nthan one issue.\nThe first two objections, concerning the availability of injunctive and/or monetary relief, were grounded on a\nmisunderstanding of the nature of the action which sought only injunctive relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2) provides, in pertinent part:\n\"An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied\n[numerosity, commonality of claims, typicality of claims, and adequacy of representation], and in\naddition: ... the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally\napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole....\"\nFED.R.CIV.P. 23(b)(2) (emphasis added). Given the nature of this action and the relief sought, it is appropriate\nthat the Settlement solely provides for injunctive relief. Although monetary damages were not available here,\nclass members are not precluded, as a result of their participation in this action, from pursuing individual claims\nfor monetary damages as otherwise permitted by law.\nApproximately 21 inmates protested their inclusion in the class. Some argued that they were not suitable class\nmembers because they did not suffer from a mental illness; others feared retribution from prison personnel; and\nothers simply did not want to participate. The Court is certainly aware of, and sensitive to, the respective\npositions of these 21 inmates. Considering that less than 10% of the inmates who submitted responses do not\nwant to participate in the Settlement, however, the Court is not convinced that class composition should be\n407 disturbed or that *407 the Settlement is not a positive resolution of this matter for the class members.\nApproximately 24 comments expressed concern about the adequacy of the Settlement's enforcement\nmechanisms. Under the Settlement, Dr. Patterson, an expert in correctional mental health care, (see supra at III\n(D)), will conduct inspections of DOC facilities four times per year. If Dr. Patterson finds that the DOC is not in\ncompliance with the Settlement, Plaintiffs' counsel may bring an enforcement action in New Jersey State Court. (\nSee Class Counsel Decl. at 6.) Plaintiffs are foreclosed from suing for enforcement in Federal Court or to sue on\nclaims with the substantially same facts as alleged in this action. (See Class Counsel Decl. at 6.) However,\nPlaintiffs can sue for any new claims in Federal Court arising after the date of the Settlement, as otherwise\npermitted by law. The Court is convinced, due to Dr. Patterson's impressive qualifications, the commitment of\nPlaintiffs' counsel, and the availability of New Jersey State Courts, that the Settlement has a satisfactory\nenforcement mechanism.\nSeveral objectors commented that the Settlement does not address the weight given mental illness in assessing\nprisoners' eligibility for parole. However, parole procedures were outside the scope of this litigation. (See Class\nCounsel Decl. at 8.) Parole procedures are governed by the New Jersey Board of Parole, which was not a\ndefendant here.\nSimilarly, several inmates complained that the Settlement did not provide for retroactive relief for prisoners who\nlost commutation (\"good time\") credits and/or were sanctioned with administrative segregation based on\n\nbehavior, which was a product of their mental illness, predating the Settlement. During the settlement\nnegotiations, Plaintiffs' counsel declined to pursue this demand for several reasons. First, the regulatory changes\nin the Settlement \"allow for the transfer of appropriate candidates from administrative segregation to the new\nmental health units beginning on July 1, 1999, even if the prisoner's confinement was the result of actions prior to\nthe Settlement....\" (Class Counsel Decl. at 9.) The regulatory changes also allow for the removal of mentally ill\nprisoners from administrative segregation of a prospective basis, if the confinement endangers their mental\nhealth. (See id.) Second, the DOC refused to undertake such a retrospective review on the grounds that it \"would\nrequire a reconstruction of prisoners' mental states at the time of the infractions at issue, often in the absence of\na contemporaneous mental evaluation.\" (See id.) Third, class counsel indicated that such relief may be more\nappropriate as part of an individual 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 action, rather than this class action Settlement.\nA number of prisoners commented on what they perceived to be insufficient attention to discharge planning.\nHowever, the Settlement contains several provisions addressing this concern. The Settlement provides for a two\nweek supply of medication to all class members upon their release and for the dissemination of information on\nsocial service assistance available in the community. (See id. at 8.) The relief available concerning discharge\nplanning was limited by practical considerations because discharged prisoners are obviously no longer in the\nDOC's custody. Therefore, the Court is satisfied with the Settlement in this regard.\nSeveral class members criticized the $1.22 million fee awarded to class counsel. As discussed infra at VIII, the\nCourt is satisfied that the fee award is reasonable. Moreover, the Court finds that the fee award does not reduce\nthe benefits to be obtained by Plaintiff class as a result of the Settlement. In fact, the fee award was not\nnegotiated with counsel for Defendants until all other terms of the Settlement had been resolved. (See id. at 6.)\nPlaintiffs' responses also expressed concerns regarding the dangers of forced medication. The Court is confident\n408 that *408 the provisions of the Settlement will address this concern by virtue of the vastly increased mental health\nstaff and periodic inspections of DOC facilities by Dr. Patterson. Under the Settlement, the DOC will create\nspecial needs units in which mentally ill prisoners will receive an extensive program of treatment. (See Class\nCounsel Decl. at 14.) For instance, SUs will provide acute care to prisoners in crises. (See id.) In an SU, each\nprisoner's care will be decided upon by a treatment review committee, and will be set forth in a comprehensive\ntreatment plan. (See id.) The Settlement also provides for specific prisoner/staff ratios which must be maintained.\nIn the SUs, there will be 1 psychiatrist for every 35 prisoners, 1 psychologist for every 50 prisoners, and one\nlicensed clinical social worker for every 25 prisoners. (See id. at 15.) The special needs units will also be staffed\nby psychiatric nurses. By stark contrast, one year ago, there was the equivalent of 5 full-time psychiatrists in the\nentire DOC system, each serving approximately 400 mentally ill prisoners. (See id.)\nFinally, several responses noted a need for heightened security for class members and bilingual mental health\nclinicians. Although these concerns were not addressed directly by the Settlement, the Court is persuaded that\nthe Monitor will serve as a safeguard against any abuse of the Settlement.\nB. Appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem\nThe next issue before the Court is whether the appointment of a guardian ad litem is necessary for the approval\nof the Settlement. Pursuant to FED.R.CIV.P. 17(c), the Court shall appoint a guardian ad litem \"for an infant or\nincompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for\nthe protection of the infant or incompetent person.\" The decision to appoint a guardian ad litem is subject to the\nCourt's discretion. See Gardner by Gardner v. Parson, 874 F.2d 131, 140 (3d Cir.1989). While the Court is\nempowered to appoint a guardian, \"it may decline to do so if the child's interests may be protected in an\nalternative manner.\" Gardner, 874 F.2d at 140.\nHere, Plaintiff class consists of prisoners with serious mental disabilities. Some members of the class are legally\nincompetent, but many members are not incompetent. (See Sandra L. Cobden, Esquire letter, dated December\n7, 1998 (\"Cobden Dec. letter\").) Nevertheless, the Court has presided over this case for over three years and has\ndeveloped a sufficient degree of familiarity with the facts of the case to determine the Settlement's fairness for\nPlaintiffs. See Eagan by Keith v. Jackson, 855 F.Supp. 765, 782 (E.D.Pa. 1994) (the court declined to appoint\nguardian ad litem, in light of familiarity with the case). In addition, the Court has heard and assessed the views of\n\nPlaintiffs' expert, Dr. Koson, on several occasions, including an evidentiary hearing. Notably, in assessing the\nSettlement, Dr. Koson recently stated that \"the proposed reforms represent a tremendous improvement over the\nprior state of affairs. If successfully implemented, I believe these changes will significantly improve the quality of\ncare afforded mentally ill prisoners in New Jersey.\" (Koson Decl. at 4.)\nThe Court has also reviewed the letters submitted by the members of the class in response to the Settlement.\nThe Court found the inmates' letters to be highly instructive in determining the need for a guardian ad litem.\nMoreover, class counsel believes that the interests of mentally incompetent prisoners will be adequately\nprotected by the Settlement. (See Cobden Dec. letter at 2.) The Court also notes that the appointment of a\nguardian ad litem would be time consuming and expensive, delaying implementation of a settlement that will\nvastly improve mental health care in the New Jersey State Prison system. Finally, the Court firmly believes that\n409 Dr. Patterson's role in inspection and *409 reporting is the functional equivalent of a guardian ad litem, ensuring\ncompliance with a Settlement that the Court finds to be fair, reasonable and adequate. As a result, the Court finds\nthat the appointment of a guardian ad litem is neither necessary nor warranted. The Court also notes for those\nwho might review the record that the substantial number of responses and the clarity of the thought expressed in\nmany of the comments belies a finding of incompetence requiring appointment of a guardian ad litem for the\nclass.\nVI. LEGAL STANDARD FOR APPROVAL\nA class action \"shall not be dismissed without the approval of the court.\" FED.R.CIV.P. 23. \"The decision of\nwhether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the sound discretion of the district court.\" \nGirsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir.1975). \"To approve a proposed settlement, the court must be satisfied\nthat the agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable and not the product of fraud or collusion.\" In re Matzo Food\nProducts Litigation, 156 F.R.D. 600, 604 (D.N.J.1994) (citing Stoetzner v. United States Steel Corp., 897 F.2d\n115, 118 (3d Cir.1990)).\nIn determining whether a settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, a court must weigh the following factors:\n(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation, (2) the reaction to the class settlement, (3) the\nstage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed, (4) the risks of establishing liability, (5) the risks\nof establishing damages, (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial, (7) the ability of the\ndefendants to withstand a greater judgment, (8) the range of the reasonableness of the settlement in light of the\nbest possible recovery, and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light\nof all the attendant risks of litigation. Girsh, 521 F.2d at 157; Stoetzner v. United States Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115,\n118 (3d Cir.1990) (citing City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 463 (2nd Cir.1974)). \"The findings\nrequired by the Girsh test are factual ... which will be upheld unless they are clearly erroneous.\" In Re General\nMotors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank, 55 F.3d 768, 786 (3d Cir.1995) (citations omitted).\nThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals outlines general principles to be followed to determine whether a settlement\n\"represents a good value for a relatively weak case or a sell-out of an otherwise strong case.\" In Re General\nMotors, 55 F.3d at 806 (holding that the settlement was not fair, adequate or reasonable since it was agreed upon\ntoo quickly with too little development on the merits). \"According to Girsh, courts approving settlements should\ndetermine a range of reasonable settlements in light of the best possible recovery ... and a range in light of all the\nattendant risks of litigation.\" Id. In cases primarily seeking monetary relief, the present value of the damages the\nplaintiffs would likely recover, if successful, discounted by the risk of not prevailing, should be compared to the\nproposed settlement. Id. \"The evaluating court must ... guard against demanding too large a settlement based on\nits view of the merits of litigation; after all, settlement is a compromise, a yielding of the highest hopes in\nexchange for certainty and resolution.\" Id.\nVII. FAIRNESS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nFactors one and three of the Girsh analysis require an evaluation of the complexity and likely duration of the\nlitigation, the stage of the proceedings, and the amount of discovery completed. At the time of this settlement, the\nparties involved had undergone extensive discovery, including the production and review of over 12,000 pages of\n\ndocuments, over thirty depositions, and three extensive inspections of New Jersey prisons attended by each\n410 party's *410 experts. (See Class Counsel Decl. at 11.) The production of this work spanned a period of over three\nyears. The parties had not yet argued their summary judgment motions, filed any pre-trial motions, nor prepared\na final pretrial order.\nThe likely duration of the trial would have been many weeks, judging from the extensive witness lists by both\nparties and the broad sweep of the subject matter before the Court. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, post-\ntrial briefings and appellate arguments would have likely required substantial time commitments by the litigants\nand the Court. This settlement occurs at an appropriate time in the litigation process, saving vast amounts of time\nand resources while still immensely benefitting inmates.\nIn addition, proceeding with the litigation would only postpone the implementation of necessary measures to\nremedy the deficiencies in the DOC's system for the delivery of mental health treatment. Such a delay would\nleave the class members without necessary care and increase the chance that untreated mentally ill patients\nwould harm themselves or others. (See Class Counsel Decl. at 4). It is prudent at this time to accept the\nSettlement since the potential costs of the trial in time and resources is outweighed by the benefits of the\nSettlement.\nThe second Girsh factor requires an analysis of the reaction of the class to the settlement. As noted supra at V\n(A), the Court is satisfied that the class members' responses, when viewed collectively, endorse the Settlement.\nThe fourth Girsh factor concerns the risks of establishing liability. The Plaintiffs acknowledge that there are\nsignificant risks in establishing liability. In addition, they also acknowledge that the Prison Litigation Reform Act,\n(\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, places limits on the scope of relief for prisoners in federal court. Class counsel\nbelieve they could have prevailed, but the risks were significant. (See Class Counsel Decl. at 11-12). A settlement\nof this type avoids such risks. The Settlement is also otherwise compliant with the PLRA.\nThe fifth factor, the risk of establishing damages, is not applicable here because Plaintiffs only sought injunctive\nrelief. Therefore, this factor does not disfavor settlement.\nThe seventh Girsh factor is the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment. The DOC defendants\nare government employees. The ability of a governmental unit to withstand a greater judgment is not particularly\napplicable and is not a factor considered by this Court.\nThe eighth factor is whether the Settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible recovery after a trial. The\nSettlement achieves most of what Plaintiffs could have hoped to accomplish through an order following a trial. It\ngrants relief addressing the central problems asserted in this litigation. The Settlement amended the DOC's\ndisciplinary regulations to allow for the consideration of mental illness in its proceedings. The Settlement will\ncreate other avenues of treatment for mentally ill patients besides psychotropic medications. The Settlement will\nsubstantially enlarge the mental health staff and require the maintenance of certain prisoner-staff ratios. It also\ncalls for yearly mental health training for each correctional officer. The Settlement also creates a more efficient\ninformation system to track the status of each class member's health. Finally, it provides for a qualified mental\nhealth expert to ensure compliance.\nThe last factor to consider is the range of reasonableness of the Settlement to a possible recovery in light of all\nthe attendant risks of litigation. The Settlement establishes a greatly improved system for addressing the needs\nand problems of mentally ill prisoners in New Jersey. Given the extent to which Plaintiffs achieved their ultimate\n411 goals, there is no reason for Plaintiffs to incur the risks of litigation by proceeding with a lengthy trial. Therefore, \n*411 the Court finds that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and entirely adequate resolution for Plaintiffs,\nconsidering the attendant risks of litigation and the marginal additional relief possible from a favorable outcome.\nThe In re General Motors analysis used the present value of the damage award as a comparison against the\npresent value of the potential award minus the risks of litigation. Unlike the In re General Motors case, the instant\ncase does not easily lend itself to a present value calculation because the main remedy sought was injunctive\nrelief. Therefore, this Court will look at the reasonableness of the Settlement as compared to the potential\nmaximum recovery through litigation while taking into account the risks facing Plaintiffs.\n\nIn part, the Settlement creates three new mental care units and provides for a larger staff with better training. The\nSettlement also was contingent on the State of New Jersey funding $16,000,000, to implement the various\nelements of the agreements, which it allocated in this year's budget. The Court finds that $16,000,000 is sufficient\nfor the implementation of the entire Settlement. The Settlement was within the range of the best possible\nrecovery for the Plaintiffs.\nThere are also risks and costs associated with continuing the litigation. There are risks that Plaintiffs would lose\nor achieve less than this Settlement at the completion of litigation. Some costs of the litigation, which are\nessentially unquantifiable, include damage to the class members' mental health due to a lack of adequate mental\nhealth treatment during the protracted litigation and the increased risks of injuries or death to class members or\nothers. Additionally, attorneys fees, and costs, as well as the Court's time and resources, would be substantial.\nTherefore, this Court finds that the value of immediate mental health service and care to the class outweighs the\npotential maximum benefit to the class in light of the risks and costs of litigation.\nAccording to the principles set forth in the In re General Motors, this Court finds that the Settlement is a \"good\nvalue\" for Plaintiffs' case. The Settlement falls within the best possible recovery Plaintiffs could hope for in light of\nall the attendant risks of litigation. Additionally, unlike the In re General Motors case, this Settlement was agreed\nupon after three years of litigation, with extensive discovery and a great deal of development of the merits of the\ncase with which this Court is intimately familiar. This Settlement represents a compromise between the parties,\nwhere Plaintiffs yielded their highest hopes of achievements in exchange for certainty and resolution. Therefore,\nthis Court concludes that this Settlement adheres to the principles outlined by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals\nin the In re General Motors decision.\nVIII. REASONABLENESS OF FEES AND COSTS\n42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) allows the prevailing party in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action to recover reasonable attorneys fees\nand costs. \"To qualify as a prevailing party, a civil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of\nhis claim. The plaintiff must obtain an enforceable judgment against the defendants ... through a consent decree\nor a settlement.\" Alexander v. Boyd, 113 F.3d 1373, 1388 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103,\n111, 113, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992)). As discussed throughout this Memorandum of Opinion,\nPlaintiffs achieved substantial relief on the merits through the Settlement. Accordingly, the Court finds that the\nPlaintiff class was the prevailing party in this litigation.\nThe calculation of the amount of attorneys fees is normally calculated by determining the \"lodestar.\" The\n\"lodestar\" is the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the applicable hourly market rate for legal\n412 service. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 *412 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Section 803(d) of\nPrison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(3), places a cap on the size of attorneys fees. The\naward of attorneys fees shall be based on an hourly rate no greater than 150% of the hourly rate allowable under\n18 U.S.C. § 3006(A). (The Criminal Justice Act). Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 144 L.Ed.2d 347\n(1999). Additionally, § 803(d) only limits \"attorney fees with respect to ... services performed after the PLRA's\neffective date but it does not so limit fees ... before the effective date.\" Id. at 2000.\nThe fees awarded in the instant case are well within the PLRA guidelines. The class counsel completed\napproximately 13,860 hours of work. The current hourly rate under § 3006(A) in the District of New Jersey is $75,\nwhich comes to $112.50 after the multiplier of the PLRA, therefore establishing a total cap of approximately\n$1,559,250. (75*1.50*13,860). This cap does not account for the hours worked before the enactment of the\nPLRA, which is not limited in the hourly fee charged nor fees permitted by the ADA.\nThe Settlement grants $1,220,000 to class counsel, including costs. This is well below the cap allowed under the\nPLRA. Defendants do not object to this amount, and they negotiated it at arms length after the substantive\nSettlement had been consummated. The Court is not permitted to \"decrease a fee award based on factors not\nraised at all by the adverse party.\" See Rode v. Dellarciprete, 892 F.2d 1177, 1183 (3d Cir.1989) (citing Bell v.\nUnited Princeton Properties, Inc., 884 F.2d 713 (3d Cir.1989)). Therefore, the Court finds that the agreement on\nattorneys fees is reasonable.\n\nIX. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court finds that the Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. The\nCourt further finds that the Settlement provides for a significant modernization of mental health treatment in New\nJersey State Prisons, that would not have been realized but for this litigation. In addition, the Court finds that the\nresolution of attorneys fees and costs is reasonable, given the work expended and the result achieved. Finally,\nthe Court finds that both the Settlement benefitting the Class and the settlement on fees and costs are within the\nrestrictions imposed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\nAccordingly, the Court will file the following Orders and Stipulations along with this Memorandum Opinion:\n(1) \"Order entering Judgment and Dismissal with Prejudice\",\n(2) \"Order of Dismissal as to Defendant, Correctional Behavioral Solutions of New Jersey, Inc.\",\n(3) \"Stipulation of Dismissal as to Defendant Correctional Behavioral Solutions of New Jersey,\nInc.\",\n(4) \"Order of Dismissal with Prejudice as to Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\"\n(5) \"Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice as to Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\",\n(6) \"Order of Dismissal as to All Cross-claims\", and\n(7) \"Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice with respect to all Cross Claims.\"\nX. POSTSCRIPT\nFrom April 19, 1996 to July 27, 1999, the Court conducted approximately forty-three (43) conferences (telephonic\nor in person) and Court hearings in this case. At least eleven (11) conferences were devoted to settlement\nnegotiations where the Court required the participation of, along with the attorneys and experts, representatives\nof the DOC (including the Commissioner), CMS and CBS. This Settlement is the result.\nEvery day, in various prisons throughout this State, professional correctional officers struggle to maintain order\n413 while the *413 vast majority of inmates struggle to serve out their time without incident. The Court firmly believes\nthat this Settlement, though not perfect, will provide basic modern mental health treatment for those inmates who\nrequire it. The Court further believes that the Monitor will insure that the privatization of health services in New\nJersey State Prisons will enhance, not diminish, effective mental health treatment. This Settlement should also\nhave a positive effect on the general prison population by assisting officers and inmates in their continuing\nstruggle to \"get through the day.\"\nThe Court commends all the attorneys for their hard work and professionalism, the experts for their assistance to\nthe Court, the representatives of the DOC, CMS, and CBS for their meaningful involvement in the process, and\nparticularly the class members for their many thoughtful and straightforward comments regarding the Settlement.\n[1] The original caption was C.F. v. Fauver and has been changed to reflect the substitution of the current class\nrepresentative and the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections.\n[2] The settlement document, without appendices, has been filed with the Clerk of Court and, by reference, is\nmade part of this Opinion and accompanying Judgment Orders and Settlement Stipulations.\n[3] The Court was presented with two sets of responses (four binders in each set from class counsel) which were\nidentical except that one set had the name/number of inmates redacted. Judge Hughes read each one of the 345\nindividual responses, and an intern was assigned to read every response in the redacted set. Both sets were\n\nthen cross-checked to assure that each and every response was considered before deciding whether to approve\nthe Settlement.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Any monitor may be replaced  in the event of death or\nunforseen  permanent, unavailability,  by  written  agreement  of\nPlaintiffs  and Defendants or on motion noticed by any of  their\ncounsel for good cause shown.  For purposes of this subsection,\n\"good cause shown\" means a showing by clear and convincing evidence\n- 17 -\n\nof corruption or nonfeasance by a monitor which is so severe as to\npreclude effective implementation of the terms of this  Settlement\nAgreement.  The court shall replace the monitor with a person who\nis mutually agreeable to Dr. Dennis Koson and Dr. Joel Dvoskin, or\ntheir  successors  as  experts  to  Plaintiffs  and  Defendants\nrespectively.

If  a monitor  is  denied  access  to  a  facility  or  any\nportion  thereof  for  reasons  of  security,  and  the  monitor  is\npermitted access as soon as the circumstances which have caused the\nsecurity concern have been abated, the fact that access has been\ndenied  will  not,  by  itself,  negatively  affect  the  monitor's\ncompliance finding.  A general explanation for the denial of access\ndue to security shall be forwarded to the monitor and Plaintiffs as\nsoon as the Commissioner of the DOC determines that this disclosure\nwould not negatively impact the security of the prison system.\nD.

Substance of the Monitor's  Report\n1.  The purpose of the monitoring is to facilitate and ensure\ncompliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  In addition\nto monitoring the creation and implementation of the policies  and\n- 23 -\n\nprocedures  as set  forth in Section  III, the monitor  shall  create\nwritten  objective  criteria,  based  upon  the  Plan  and  the\nRegulations,  on which Defendants'  compliance  with  the  Settlement\nAgreement shall be judged.  The written objective criteria shall be\norganized according to the following categories:\n(a)  Discipline\n(b)  Reception  Evaluations\n(c)  SUs\n(d)  RTUs and TCUs\n(e)  Outpatient  Care\n(f)  Inpatient Care  (with the understanding that the DOC will\nparticipate  in  the  commitment  process,  but  cannot\nguarantee  that  TPH  will  take  the  inmate  upon  the\nconclusion of the commitment  process)\n(g)  Construction\n(h)  Training\n(i)  Creation of  Policies\n(j)  Staffing\n2.  The monitor shall memorialize his or her findings by way\nof  a written  report  following  each  set  of  inspections.  Reports\nshall be organized according to the categories set forth in Section\n(G)(1) and shall contain the  following:\n(i)  Steps taken by Defendants to implement the terms of  the\nSettlement  Agreement  since  the  monitor's  prior  report  and  a\nsystematic  review  of  the progress  regarding  each of  the  written\nobjective  criteria  formulated by the monitor  since the  monitor's\nprior report;\n- 24 -\n\n(ii) Changes in circumstances affecting Defendants' ability to\nprovide the medical, mental health or custodial care provided for\nby the Settlement Agreement since the monitor's prior report;\n(iii)  Recommendations which may facilitate implementation of\nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement, including a summary of any\nconversations between the monitor and representatives of the DOC or\nmedical or mental health service providers under contract with the\nDOC concerning such recommendations that were conducted outside the\npresence of Plaintiffs' counsel;\n(iv)  A finding with respect to whether the Defendants are in\nSubstantial Compliance or Non-Compliance as to each category set\nforth in Section IV(G)(1).\n3.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  to  by  the  Plaintiffs  and\nDefendants,  the  monitor  shall  provide  a  copy  of  his  report\nsimultaneously to Plaintiffs and Defendants within 30  days of the\nconclusion of^the on-site inspections which form the basis of the\nreport.\nH.  Definition of Compliance\n1.  Substantial Compliance shall be determined on a category\nby  category  basis.  The  categories  to  be  evaluated  are  those\nidentified  in  Section  IV(G)(1).  Substantial  Compliance  for  a\nspecific  category  shall  mean  that  Defendants  have  and  may\nreasonably be expected to continue to substantially  satisfy the\nwritten  objective  criteria  set  forth  by  the  monitor  for  that\ncategory.  To achieve Substantial Compliance the Defendants need\n- 25 -\n\nnot  be  in  perfect,  100%, compliance  with  each  of  the  written\nobjective criteria set forth by the monitor for that category.  The\nmonitor shall have the discretion to measure Substantial Compliance\nin  each  category  by  weighting  the  various  written  objective\ncriteria.\n2.  Non-Compliance  means  efforts  which  do  not  meet  the\ndefinition of Substantial  Compliance  for a particular  category.\nNon-Compliance  shall  include  Defendants1  failure  to permit  the\nmonitor to undertake inspections according to the terms set forth\nherein.  A  finding  of  Non-Compliance  shall  not  be  based  on\nisolated,  non-continuing  instances  of  failure  to  substantially\nsatisfy  the objective  criteria  in the  categories  identified  in\nSection IV(G)(1), nor shall a finding of Non-Compliance be based on\nomissions of a technical or unimportant nature.\n3.  . An independent decision of any individual DOC employee or\nemployee of any medical or mental health services provider(s) under\ncontract  with the DOC not  to speak with the monitor  shall  not\nresult in a finding of non-compliance so long as the monitor is\nable  to  obtain  the  information  he/she  is  seeking  from  another\nsource in a timely manner.  The employees of the medical and mental\nhealth  services  provider(s)  under  contract  with  the, DOC  are\nrequired  to communicate with  the monitor except  in the  limited\ncircumstance  that  a. psychiatrist, psychologist,  licenced  social\nworker,  licenced  clinical  social  worker  or  psychiatric  nurse\n(hereafter collectively referred to as \"mental health clinicians\")\nhas a good faith belief that disclosure of information would be\n- 26 -\n\ndetrimental  to an inmate's mental health.  In the event  that a\nmental  health  clinician  has  such  a  belief,  the  mental  health\nclinician shall provide the monitor with an explanation which forms\nthe basis of their refusal to communicate with the monitor without\nrevealing the nature of the confidential information.\nI.  Emergent Circumstances\nIf during the course of an inspection the monitor  finds a\ncircumstance  which poses  an  imminent  and  significant  health  or\nsafety  risk  to  Class  Member(s),  the  monitor  shall  immediately\ncontact  the DOC Health Services representative  accompanying  the\nmonitor  on  the  inspection  and  any  other  appropriate  person  to\nalleviate the perceived risk.  If the monitor's concerns about any\nindividual  and/or  any  systemic  problem  are  not  satisfactorily\naddressed, the monitor shall initiate a telephone conference with\nPlaintiffs, Defendants, and the medical and mental health services\nprovider(s) under contract with the DOC.  Defendants shall have 24\nhours  from  the  conference  call  to  address  and/or  remedy  the\ncircumstance  which  the  monitor  finds  to  pose  an  imminent  and\nsignificant  health  or  safety  risk  to Class  Member(s).  If  the\nimminent and significant health or safety risk to Class Member(s)\nis  not  adequately  addressed  and/or  remedied  within  24  hours,\nPlaintiffs  may  file  an  application  to  remedy  the  emergent\ncircumstance with the court.\n- 27 -\n\nJ.  Curing  Non-Compliance\n1.  If  the  monitor  finds  Substantial  Compliance  in any\ncategory identified in Section  IV(J)(5), Plaintiffs shall have 15\ncalendar days from receipt of the report to serve objections to the\nmonitors'  report  on  the  monitor  and  the  Defendants.  Upon\nconsideration of the Plaintiffs' objection, the monitor may revise\nhis or her findings.  If the monitor, upon  consideration of the\nobjections, revises his/her finding to one of Non-Compliance, the\nprocedures set forth in Sections IV(J)(2),(3) and (6) below  shall\napply.\n2.  If  the  monitor  finds  Non-Compliance  in  any  category\nidentified in Section IV(J)(5), Defendants shall have:\n(a)  20 calendar  days  from  receipt  of the report  to  serve\nobjections to the monitors' report on the monitor and Plaintiffs.\nPlaintiffs  shall  have  7  calendar  days  from  receipt  of  the\nobjections  to serve a response  upon the monitor  and Defendants.\nUpon  consideration of any Defendants' objections and Plaintiffs'\nresponses,  the monitor  may revise  his or her findings.  If the\nmonitor,  upon  consideration  of  the  objections  and  responses,\nrevises  his/her  finding  to one of  Substantial  Compliance,  this\nfinding  shall  relate  back  to  the  date  of  the  last  regular\ninspection and shall not negatively affect the period of continuous\nSubstantial Compliance and shall not be counted as a \"cure\" for the\npurposes of Section IV(J)(5); and\n(b)  30 calendar days from receipt of the report to cure any\ndeficiencies noted in the report.  For the purpose of counting the\n- 28 -\n\n3 0  calendar  days,  the  time  the  monitor  spends  considering\nobjections  provided  under  Section  IV(J)(2)(a),  shall  not  be\ncounted.\n3.  Plaintiffs and Defendants agree that Defendants shall be\nentitled  to  a  prescribed  number  of  opportunities  within  each\ncompliance  category  to cure  a finding of Non-Compliance  without\nadversely affecting the period of continuous Substantial Compliance\n(hereinafter referred to as a \"cure\").  Thus, Defendants shall be\ndeemed  to  remain  in  continuous  Substantial  Compliance\nnotwithstanding the monitor's initial finding of Non-Compliance if\nDefendants remedy in a timely manner the deficiencies found by the\nmonitor using one or more of their prescribed  cures set forth in\nSection  IV(J)(5).\n4.  If Defendants cure the deficiency which caused a finding\nof Non-Compliance by using one of the allotted \"cures\" set forth in\nSection  IV(J)(5), the following shall apply:\n(a)  if the monitor can determine from written  documentation\nprovided by Defendants and copied to Plaintiffs that the deficiency\nhas been cured to his or her satisfaction, then the monitor  shall\nissue a revised finding of Substantial Compliance.  The effective\ndate of the revised finding of Substantial Compliance shall be the\ndate of the inspection which gave rise to the initial  finding of\nNon-Compliance; or\n(b)  if  the  monitor  cannot  determine  from  written\ndocumentation that the deficiency has been cured, such that an on-\nsite inspection of the DOC facility is necessary, Defendants shall\n- 29 -\n\nhave the option of paying for additional on-site inspection(s) at\nthe facility/facilities where the deficiency occurred.  If, after\nsuch  additional  on-site  inspection(s),  the  monitor  finds\nSubstantial Compliance, the monitor shall issue a revised report\nthat includes a revised finding of Substantial Compliance and the\neffective date shall be the date of the inspection which gave rise\nto the finding of Non-Compliance.\n5.  The number of  cures which Defendants may use are  set\nforth  in  the  following  table.  In  the  event  that  the  monitor\ndetermines  that  the  deficiency  has  been  cured,  Plaintiffs  and\nDefendants will accordingly adjust the table of cures to reflect\nthe  number  of  remaining  cures  available  to Defendants  in  each\ncompliance category.\nCategory Number of Cures\nDiscipline 2\nReception Evaluations 2\nSUs 2\nRTUs and TCUs 2\nOutpatient Care 3\nIn-Patient Care  (that the DOC will 2\nparticipate in the commitment process,\nwith no guarantee that TPH will take the\ninmate upon the conclusion of the\ncommitment process)\nCons t rue t ion 2\n- 30 -\n\nTraining 2\nCreation of  Policies 1\nStaffing 1  (which may only\nused at  the\ndiscretion of the\nmonitor and when the\noverall  staffing\ndoes not fall below\n85%)\n6.  In  the  event  that  Defendants  have  exhausted  all  of  the\nallotted  cures  for  a  category  pursuant  to  Section  IV(J)(5),\nDefendants may remedy a deficiency which caused a finding of Non-\nCompliance  in such category and the following shall apply:\n(a)  if the monitor can determine from written  documentation\nprovided by Defendants and copied to Plaintiffs that the deficiency\nhas  been  remedied  to  his  or  her  satisfaction,  then  the  monitor\nshall  issue  a  finding  of  Substantial  Compliance.  The  effective\ndate of the finding of Substantial Compliance shall be the date of\nthe  remedy  as  identified  on  the  documentation  provided  by\nDefendants  and  a  new  12  month*period  of  continuous  Substantial\nCompliance  shall begin for that category; or\n(b)  if  the  monitor  cannot  determine  from  written\ndocumentation that the deficiency has been remedied, such that  an\non-site  inspection  of  the  DOC  facility  is  necessary,  Defendants\nshall  have  the  option  of  paying  for  additional  on-site\ninspection(s)  at  the  facility/facilities  where  the  deficiency\noccurred.  If,  after  such  additional  on-site  inspection(s), the\n- 31 -\n\nmonitor finds Substantial  Compliance, the monitor shall issue a\nreport that includes a finding of Substantial Compliance, of which\nthe effective date  shall be the date of the additional  on-site\ninspection  and a new  12 month period of  continuous  Substantial\nCompliance shall begin for that category.\nK.  Enforcement of the Settlement Agreement\n1.  Prior to bringing an action to enforce the Settlement\nAgreement, Plaintiffs and Defendants must wait until the last date\nto cure or remedy a deficiency has passed pursuant  to Sections\nIV(I) or (J). Whoever objects to the monitor's finding shall bear\nthe  burden  of  proof  in  any  action  to  enforce  the  Settlement\nAgreement.\n2.  The  monitor's  report  and  any  documents  reviewed  or\ninformation obtained during the monitoring period may be used in\nany action to enforce  the Settlement Agreement.

Box 814\nLiberty Corner, NJ 07938\nHUGHES.  U.S.M.J.\nThis matter comes before this Court pursuant to  FED. R. CIV. P.  23(e)  for approval of a\nproposed settlement agreement (\"the Settlement\") entered into by the Plaintiffs and Defendants.\nThe Court has considered the written submissions of the parties, 350 responses to the Settlement\nby certain members of the class, the record of the fairness hearing, held on July 6,  1999, and the\nSettlement itself.\nThe parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the United States Magistrate Judge, for all\npurposes, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A.  § 636 and FED. R. Crv. P. 73.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs allege civil rights violations, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A.  § 1983 and violations of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.A.  §12132.  Specifically, Plaintiffs, a\ngroup of inmates with mental disorders in the New Jersey State Prison system, assert that they\nhave been unlawfully denied treatment and medication for their mental disorders.  Plaintiffs\ncontend that the deprivation of medical treatment violates their right against cruel and unusual\npunishment as well as their right to be free from discrimination for their disabilities pursuant to\n\nthe ADA.  Defendants, to the contrary, contend that Plaintiffs' mental health treatment is\nadequate and that it complies with the United States Constitution and the ADA.\nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn April 11, 1996, a class action complaint was filed against the Commissioner of the\nNew Jersey Department of Corrections and various other officials in the Department of\nCorrections (\"DOC\").  On November 20, 1996, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for\ncertification of a class action, pursuant to  FED. R. CIV. P. 23.\nOn July 18, 1997, a motion was granted allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint.  The\namended complaint joined Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (\"CMS\"), and Correctional\nBehavioral Services, Inc. (\"CBS\"), as co-defendants.  CBS and CMS are private contractors\nengaged by the state of New Jersey to provide mental health services to inmates.\nCBS, CMS, and the DOC moved for summary judgment.  Plaintiffs filed a cross- motion\nfor summary judgment thereafter.  The summary judgement motions were dismissed as moot on\nApril 29, 1999, after the parties agreed to settle this matter.\nDiscovery related to this case has been immense, leading to the production of more than\n12,000 pages of documents.  In addition, the parties took over thirty depositions and conducted\nthree extensive inspections of the New Jersey prisons.\nIntense settlement negotiations and conferences began in November of 1998 and continued\nthrough March ot 1999.  The result of these conferences and negotiations was the Settlement.\nThe Court conducted a fairness hearing on July 6, 1999, and the Court hereby grants final\napproval of this Settlement.\n\nIII.  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT2\nThe Settlement consists of five major parts:  (1) amendments to the DOC disciplinary\nregulations, (2) a mental health treatment plan, (3) a statement on new policies and procedures by\nthe DOC, (4) the funding, monitoring and enforcement of the Settlement, and (5) liability of\nDefendants. Separate and apart from the Settlement, the parties entered into an agreement on\nattorneys fees and costs, but only after the Settlement benefitting the inmates had been agreed\nupon.  The following discussion in this section will summarize each part of the Settlement and the\nfee agreement.\nA.  Amendments to the DOC Disciplinary Regulations\nThe DOC agreed to change parts of its disciplinary regulations.  Under the new\nregulations, all prisoners with pending disciplinary charges will have their names given to the\nmental health staff before their disciplinary hearing.  The mental health staff will inform the\ndisciplinary hearing officer whether the individual charged is undergoing mental health treatment.\nThe hearing officer,  based on all the information available to him, will decide whether or\n*\nnot to request a psychological or psychiatric evaluation of the prisoner.  The hearing officer will\nconsider all the information, including the evaluation, before deciding whether punishment will be\nimposed on the prisoner.  Instead of, or in addition to, the sanctions imposed on the prisoner, the\nhearing officer may also refer a mentally ill prisoner to the mental health unit for appropriate care\nand treatment.  ~\nAdditionally, if a prisoner is confined in disciplinary detention, and suffers a deterioration\n2 The settlement document, without appendices, has been filed with the Clerk of Court and,\nby reference, is made part of this Opinion and accompanying Judgment Orders and Settlement\nStipulations.\n\non his or her mental health status, the mental health staff will refer the matter to the administrator\nof the prison where the inmate is held.  The Special Administrative Segregation Review\nCommittee shall release the prisoner from Administrative Segregation if the prisoner has a history\nof mental illness and the Committee decides that continued confinement in the unit would be\nharmful to the prisoner's mental health.\nB.  Plan for Mental Health Treatment\nAll new prisoners will receive a mental health assessment within 72 hours of arrival. The\nDOC will ensure that there is an adequate number of staff to serve the entire prison population.\nCorrection officers, internal affairs investigators, disciplinary hearing officers and administrators\nwill receive additional training about mental illness and dealing with mentally ill prisoners.\nThe DOC will create three Stabilization Units (\"SU\"), for the purpose of treating mentally\nill prisoners experiencing a mental health crisis.  These units will be located at Northern State\nPrison, New Jersey State Prison, and the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women.  The\nDOC will also create Residential Treatment Units (\"RTU\"), and Traditional Care Units (\"TCU\").\nAfter discharge from the SU, the RTU will provide a structured and supportive environment for\nmentally ill prisoners unable, due to their illness, to be transferred to the general population.  The\nTCU will help prisoners with less severe mental illness to make a gradual adjustment to the\ngeneral population.  The decision about placing prisoners in these units will be determined by the\nmental health staff.\nC.  Policies and Procedures\nThe DOC agrees to review or create five general types of policies and procedures in order\nto implement the Settlement: (1) any policies and procedures consistent with the goals of the plan\n\nand the amendments to the disciplinary regulations; (2) involuntary medication policies and\nprocedures, including those describing the difference between emergency and non-emergency\ninvoluntary medication; (3) polices and procedures on the use of force situations involving class\nmembers which provide for input from the mental health staff; (4) medication policy and\nprocedures regarding medication administration, medication prescription, management of\nmedication, inmate non-compliance and formulary lists; and (5) discharge planning for class\nmembers in anticipation of their release from DOC facilities with minimum requirements, as\noutlined in the Settlement, that must be met.\nDefendants will submit the new or revised policies and procedures to the Monitor.\nAdditionally, Defendants agree to implement these policies and procedures to ensure continued\ncompliance with the Settlement.\nD.  Funding. Monitoring and Enforcement\nThe Settlement requires that enough funding must be allocated by the State of New Jersey\nto implement this program through the Fiscal Year 2000.  The Governor recommended, and the\n*\nNew Jersey Legislature approved $16,000,000 to implement the Settlement.  The Commissioner\nof the Department of Corrections certifies that $16,000,000 is sufficient to implement the\nSettlement.  Therefore, the Court finds that funding is available to implement the program.\nDr. Raymond F. Patterson, a forensic psychiatrist, will be appointed as an independent\nmental health expert to oversee Defendants' compliance.  Dr. Patterson has a distinguished career\nin psychiatry and correctional services.  (See Class Counsel Decl., Exhibit A, Patterson\nCurriculum Vitae (\"Patterson C.V.\").)  He graduated from Northwestern University in 1973 and\nwent on to receive his M.D. from  Howard University College of Medicine in 1977.  (See\n\nPatterson C.V.)  In medical school, Dr. Patterson received the National Medical Fellowship\nIncorporated Scholarship Clinical Psychiatry Award.  (See id.)  His numerous professional\nawards include the Mental Hygiene Administration Certificate of Appreciation for Risk\nManagement/Quality Assessment Program, and the Department of Human Services Distinguished\nService Award; both of which were awarded in October 1992.  (See id.)  Presently, Dr. Patterson\nis serving as the Director of Forensic Services for the Commission on Mental Health Services in\nWashington, D.C.  (See id.)  From May 1997 until February 1998, he worked as the Chief\nPsychiatrist for the Department of Public Safety & Correctional Services in Baltimore, Maryland.\n(See id.)  In addition, Dr. Patterson is currently on staff as an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at\nthe following schools:  Howard University College of Medicine, the Institute of Psychiatry and\nHuman Behavior at University of Maryland School of Medicine, and Georgetown University\nDepartment of Psychiatry.  (See id.)  Dr. Patterson has also authored numerous papers on mental\nhealth and spoken to various professional groups across the country on this topic.\nDr. Patterson will inspect the DOC facilities four times a year.  He will be able to\n*\ninterview prisoners and staff during his inspection.  After each inspection, Dr. Patterson will\nwrite a report explaining whether the DOC has substantially complied with the Settlement.  Dr.\nPatterson's report will be confidential, except for copies to the medical and mental health service\nproviders under contract with the DOC, Defendants, counsel to the Plaintiffs, and any former\nemployee witnesses, outside non-party consultants, or experts listed  in the Settlement.  The\ninmates will not have access to the report.  If the DOC has not substantially complied with the\nSettlement, it has a limited number of chances to correct the problem.  Once the DOC is in full\ncompliance for twelve continuous months, then the Settlement will terminate.\n\nPrisoners concerned with their mental health care may submit their grievances directly to\nthe Director of Health Services Unit or to the Plaintiff class counsel, who will then forward these\nconcerns to Dr. Patterson, as well as to the contractors providing medical and health services.\nThe Plaintiffs, only through class counsel, may sue to enforce this agreement in New\nJersey State Court.  No other individual or group of prisoners may sue to enforce this agreement,\nand Plaintiffs' counsel may not bring such a suit unless Dr. Patterson finds that the DOC is not in\ncompliance with the Settlement.\nE.  Liability\nThis Settlement is an agreement between Plaintiffs and the DOC.  The DOC makes no\nadmission of liability as to the Plaintiffs' claims.  Plaintiffs agree to dismiss their claims against\nthe DOC, CMS and CBS with prejudice.  All cross-claims between Defendants will be dismissed\nwith prejudice.\nF.  \" Attorneys Fees and Costs\nAs part of this agreement, the DOC will pay the Plaintiff class counsel a total of\n$1,220,000, in resolution of all attorneys fees and costs incurred by Plaintiffs' counsel in\nlitigating this case.  Plaintiffs' counsel normal rate for fees and costs would have amounted to\nmore than $3,900,000.  Since counsel undertook the representation on a pro bono basis, and since\ntheir primary objective was the improvement of mental health care for prisoners, they agreed to\ncut their costs over 67% and accept a lower amount. Significantly, this agreement was reached\nafter the substantive settlement was agreed upon.\n\nIV.  NOTICE TO CLASS\nOn May 15, 1999, this Court signed an order requiring distribution of the notice of the\nproposed Settlement to all class members.  Approximately 2,455 notices were distributed to the\nclass.  The notice contained a copy of the Settlement, a plain language summary in English and\nSpanish, and a comment sheet, all of which were enclosed into a sealed envelope.  The class\nmembers were required to have all comments postmarked by June 25, 1999.  The Court, on its\nown initiative, decided to consider any comment received by July 28, 1999.  (Only two additional\ncomments were received).\nThe Court determined that this distribution of the proposed settlement and comment sheets\nwas the most appropriate means for providing notice to the class members in accordance with the\nFED. R. Crv. P. 23(e).\nV.  RESPONSE OF CLASS3\nThe members of the Plaintiff class submitted comments in response to the Settlement.  As\na result, class counsel received comments from 345 inmate class members.  (See Sandra L.\nCobden, Esquire letter, dated July 1, 1999 (\"Cobden's July letter\").)  The Court directly received\n14 responses, of which 9 were duplicates of responses sent to class counsel.  A total of 350\ndifferent responses were received and read.  After reviewing the inmate responses and class\ncounsel's assessment of the comments, the Court is satisfied that, on balance, the class members\nsupport the Settlement.\n3The Court was presented with two sets of responses (four binders in each set from class\ncounsel) which were identical except that one set had the name/number of inmates redacted.  Judge\nHughes read each one of the 345 individual responses, and an intern was assigned to read every\nresponse in the redacted set. Both sets were then cross-checked to assure that each and every\nresponse was considered before deciding whether to approve the Settlement\n\nOf the 350 responses, 270 prisoners submitted responses relevant to the issues raised by\nthis action.  The other 80 comments raised general complaints concerning treatment by mental\nhealth, correctional, and disciplinary personnel; asked for a referral; or sought clarifications\nregarding the Settlement.  (See Cobden's July letter at n. 1.)  Of the 270 comments addressing this\naction, 170 responses addressed the terms of the Settlement.  Of those 170 letters, 89 prisoners\nindicated that they approved of the Settlement.  Notably, 15 of those 89 prisoners who approved\nof the Settlement also expressed concerns or criticism regarding particular provisions.  {See id. at\n2, n.2.)\nA.  Objections to the Settlement Agreement\nEighty-one responses objected to the Settlement.  (See Declaration of Sandra L. Cobden\nand Patricia Perlmutter (\"Class Counsel Decl.\") at 5.)  The objections to the Settlement raised the\nfollowing issues: (1) the relief sought was merely injunctive; (2) the Settlement did not provide\nfor monetary relief; (3) inmates protested as to their inclusion in the class; (4) inmates expressed\ntheir concern that the Settlement will not be enforced; (5) the Settlement failed to modify the\n*\nparole process for mentally ill prisoners; (6) the Settlement did not include a provision for\nretroactive relief for prisoners who lost commutation (\"good time\") credits and/or were\nsanctioned with administrative segregation based on behavior predating the Settlement which was\na product of their mental illness; (7) the scope of relief provided under the Settlement to prisoners\nbeing released was inadequate; (8) criticism of class counsel's fee award; (9) a need for\nheightened security measures for class members; (10) the dangers of forced medication; (11) a\nneed for bilingual mental health clinicians.  Many responses addressed more than one issue.\nThe first two objections, concerning the availability of injunctive and/or monetary relief,\n10\n\nwere grounded on a misunderstanding of the nature of the action which sought only injunctive\nrelief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  Rule 23(b)(2) provides, in pertinent\npart:\nAn action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of\nsubdivision (a) are satisfied [numerosity, commonality of claims,\ntypicality of claims, and adequacy of representation], and in addition: .\n. . the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the\nclass as a whole.  ...\"\nFED.  R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) (emphasis added).  Given the nature of this action and the relief sought,\nit is appropriate that the Settlement solely provides for injunctive relief.  Although monetary\ndamages were not available here, class members are not precluded, as a result of their\nparticipation in this action, from pursuing individual claims for monetary damages as otherwise\npermitted by law.\nApproximately 21 inmates protested their inclusion in the class.  Some argued that they\nwere not suitable class members because they did not suffer from a mental illness; others feared\nretribution from prison personnel; and others simply did not want to participate.  The Court is\ncertainly aware of, and sensitive to, the respective positions of these 21 inmates.  Considering that\nless than 10% of the inmates who submitted responses do not want to participate in the\nSettlement, however, the Court is not convinced that class composition should be disturbed or that\nthe Settlement is~not a positive resolution of this matter for the class members.\nApproximately 24 comments expressed concern about the adequacy of the Settlement's\nenforcement mechanisms.  Under the Settlement, Dr. Patterson, an expert in correctional mental\nhealth care, (see supra at HI( D)), will conduct inspections of DOC facilities four times per year.\n11\n\nIf Dr. Patterson finds that the DOC is not in compliance with the Settlement, Plaintiffs' counsel\nmay bring an enforcement action in New Jersey State Court.  (See Class Counsel Decl. at 6.)\nPlaintiffs are foreclosed from suing for enforcement in Federal Court or to sue on claims with the\nsubstantially same facts as alleged in this action. (See Class Counsel Decl. at 6.)  However,\nPlaintiffs can sue for any new claims in Federal Court arising after the date of the Settlement, as\notherwise permitted by law.  The Court is convinced, due to Dr. Patterson's impressive\nqualifications, the commitment of Plaintiffs' counsel, and the availability of New Jersey State\nCourts, that the Settlement has a satisfactory enforcement mechanism.\nSeveral objectors commented that the Settlement does not address the weight given mental\nillness in assessing prisoners' eligibility for parole.  However, parole procedures were outside the\nscope of this litigation.  (See Class Counsel Decl. at 8.)  Parole procedures are governed by the\nNew Jersey Board of Parole, which was not a defendant here.\nSimilarly, several inmates complained that the Settlement did not provide for retroactive\nrelief for prisoners who lost commutation (\"good time\") credits and/or were sanctioned with\nadministrative segregation based on behavior, which was a product of their mental illness,\npredating the Settlement.  During the settlement negotiations, Plaintiffs' counsel declined to\npursue this demand for several reasons.  First, the regulatory changes in the Settlement \"allow for\nthe transfer of appropriate candidates from administrative segregation to the new mental health\nunits beginning-on July 1, 1999, even if the prisoner's confinement was the result of actions prior\nto the Settlement. ...\"  (Class Counsel Decl. at 9.)  The regulatory changes also allow for the\nremoval of mentally ill prisoners from administrative segregation of a prospective basis, if the\nconfinement endangers their mental health.  (See id.)  Second, the DOC refused to undertake such\n12\n\na retrospective review on the grounds that it \"would require a reconstruction of prisoners' mental\nstates at the time of the infractions at issue, often in the absence of a contemporaneous mental\nevaluation.\"  (See id.)  Third, class counsel indicated that such relief may be more appropriate as\npart of an individual  42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 action, rather than this class action Settlement.\nA number of prisoners commented on what they perceived to be insufficient attention to\ndischarge planning.  However, the Settlement contains several provisions addressing this concern.\nThe Settlement provides for a two week supply of medication to all class members upon their\nrelease and for the dissemination of information on social service assistance available in the\ncommunity.  (See id. at 8.)  The relief available concerning discharge planning was limited by\npractical considerations because discharged prisoners are obviously no longer in the DOC's\ncustody.  Therefore, the Court is satisfied with the Settlement in this regard.\nSeveral class members criticized die $1.22 million fee awarded to class counsel.  As\ndiscussed infra at VIII, the Court is satisfied that the fee award is reasonable.  Moreover, the\nCourt finds that the fee award does not reduce the benefits to be obtained by Plaintiff class as a\nresult of the Settlement.  In fact, the fee award was not negotiated with counsel for Defendants\nuntil all other terms of the Settlement had been resolved.  (See id. at 6.)\nPlaintiffs' responses also expressed concerns regarding the dangers of forced medication.\nThe Court is confident that the provisions of the Settlement will address this concern by virtue of\nthe vastly increased mental health staff and periodic inspections of DOC facilities by Dr.\nPatterson.  Under the Settlement, the DOC will create special needs units in which mentally ill\nprisoners will receive an extensive program of treatment.  (See Class Counsel Decl. at 14.)  For\ninstance, SUs will provide acute care to prisoners in crises.  (See id.)  In an SU, each prisoner's\n13\n\ncare will be decided upon by a treatment review committee, and will be set forth in a\ncomprehensive treatment plan.  {See id.)  The Settlement also provides for specific prisoner/staff\nratios which must be maintained.  In the SUs, there will be 1 psychiatrist for every 35 prisoners,\n1 psychologist for every 50 prisoners, and one licensed clinical social worker for every 25\nprisoners.  (See id. at 15.)  The special needs units will also be staffed by psychiatric nurses.  By\nstark contrast, one year ago, there was the equivalent of 5 full-time psychiatrists in the entire\nDOC system, each serving approximately 400 mentally ill prisoners.  (See id.)\nFinally, several responses noted a need for heightened security for class members and\nbilingual mental health clinicians.  Although these concerns were not addressed directly by the\nSettlement, the Court is persuaded that the Monitor will serve as a safeguard against any abuse of\nthe Settlement.\nB.  Appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem\nthe next issue before the Court is whether the appointment of a guardian ad litem is\nnecessary for the approval of the Settlement.  Pursuant to FED. R. Civ. P. 17(c), the Court shall\nappoint a guardian ad litem \"for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an\naction or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or\nincompetent person.\"  The decision to appoint a guardian ad litem is subject to the Court's\ndiscretion.  See Gardner by Gardner v. Parson, 874 F.2d 131, 140 (3d Cir. 1989).  While the\nCourt is empowered to appoint a guardian, \"it may decline to do so if the child's interests may be\nprotected in an alternative manner.\"  Gardner, 874 F.2d at 140.\nHere, Plaintiff class consists of prisoners with serious mental disabilities.  Some members\nof the class are legally incompetent, but many members are not incompetent.  (See Sandra L.\n14\n\nCobden, Esquire letter, dated December 7, 1998 (\"Cobden Dec. letter\").)  Nevertheless, the\nCourt has presided over this case for over three years and has developed a sufficient degree of\nfamiliarity with the facts of the case to determine the Settlement's fairness for Plaintiffs.  See\nEagan by Eagan v. Jackson, 855 F. Supp. 765, 782 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (the court declined to\nappoint guardian ad litem, in light of familiarity with the case).  In addition, the Court has heard\nand assessed the views of Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Koson, on several occasions, including an\nevidentiary hearing.  Notably, in assessing the Settlement, Dr. Koson recently stated that \"the\nproposed reforms represent a tremendous improvement over the prior state of affairs.  If\nsuccessfully  implemented, I believe these changes will significantly improve the quality of care\nafforded mentally ill prisoners in New Jersey.\"  (Koson Decl. at 4.)\nThe Court has also reviewed the letters submitted by the members of the class in response\nto the Settlement.  The Court found the inmates' letters to be highly instructive in determining the\nneed for a guardian ad litem.  Moreover, class counsel believes that the interests of mentally\nincompetent prisoners will be adequately protected by the Settlement.  (See Cobden Dec. letter at\n2.)  The Court also notes that the appointment of a guardian ad litem would be time consuming\nand expensive, delaying implementation of a settlement that will vastly improve mental health\ncare in the New Jersey State Prison system.  Finally, the Court firmly believes that Dr.\nPatterson's role in inspection and reporting is the functional equivalent of a guardian ad litem,\nensuring compliance with a Settlement that the Court fmds to be fair, reasonable and adequate.\nAs a result, the Court finds that the appointment of a guardian ad litem is neither necessary nor\nwarranted.  The Court also notes for those who might review the record that the substantial\nnumber of responses and the clarity of the thought expressed in many of the comments belies a\n15\n\nfinding of incompetence requiring appointment of a guardian ad litem for the class.\nVI.  LEGAL STANDARD FOR APPROVAL\nA class action \"shall not be dismissed without the approval of the court.\" FED. R. CIV. P.\n23.  \"The decision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the\nsound discretion of the district court.\" Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975).  \"To\napprove a proposed settlement, the court must be satisfied that the agreement is fair, adequate and\nreasonable and not the product of fraud or collusion.\"  In re Matzo Food Products Litigation, 156\nF.R.D. 600, 604 (D.N.J. 1994) (citing Stoetzner v. United States Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115, 118\n(3d Cir. 1990)).\nIn determining whether a settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, a court must weigh\nthe following factors: (1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation, (2) the\nreaction to the class settlement, (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery\ncompleted, (4) the risks of establishing liability, (5) the risks of establishing damages, (6) the\nrisks of maintaining the class action through the trial, (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand\na greater judgment, (8) die range of the reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best\npossible recovery, and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible\nrecovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.  Girsh, 521 F.2d at 157; Stoetzner v.\nUnited States Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115, 118 (3d Cir. 1990) (citing City of Detroit v. Grinnell\nCorp., 495 F.2d-448, 463 (2nd Cir. 1974)).  \"The findings required by the Girsh test are factual .\n. . which will be upheld unless they are clearly erroneous.\"  In Re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up\nTruck Fuel Tank, 55 F.3d 768, 786 (3d Cir. 1995) (citations omitted).\nThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals outlines general principles to be followed to determine\n16\n\nwhether a settlement \"represents a good value for a relatively weak case or a sell-out of an\notherwise strong case.\"  In Re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 806 (holding that the settlement was\nnot fair, adequate or reasonable since it was agreed upon too quickly with too little development\non the merits).  \"According to Girsh, courts approving settlements should determine a range of\nreasonable settlements in light of the best possible recovery . . . and a range in light of all the\nattendant risks of litigation.\"  Id.  In cases primarily seeking monetary relief, the present value of\nthe damages the plaintiffs would likely recover, if successful, discounted by the risk of not\nprevailing, should be compared to the proposed settlement.  Id.  \"The evaluating court must.  . .\nguard against demanding too large a settlement based on its view of the merits of litigation; after\nall, settlement is a compromise, a yielding of the highest hopes in exchange for certainty and\nresolution.\"  Id.\nVII.  FAIRNESS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nFactors one and three of the Girsh analysis require an evaluation of the complexity and\nlikely duration of the litigation, the stage of the proceedings, and the amount of discovery\ncompleted.  At the time of this settlement, the parties involved had undergone extensive\ndiscovery, including the production and review of over 12,000 pages of documents, over thirty\ndepositions, and three extensive inspections of New Jersey prisons attended by each party's\nexperts.  (See Class Counsel Decl. at 11.)  The production of this work spanned a period of over\nthree years.  The parties had not yet argued their summary judgment motions, filed any pre-trial\nmotions, nor prepared a final pretrial order.\nThe likely duration of the trial would have been many weeks, judging from the extensive\nwitness lists by both parties and the broad sweep of the subject matter before the Court.\n17\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the trial, post-trial briefings and appellate arguments would have\nlikely required substantial time commitments by the litigants and the Court.  This settlement\noccurs at an appropriate time in the litigation process, saving vast amounts of time and resources\nwhile still immensely benefitting inmates.\nIn addition, proceeding with the litigation would only postpone the implementation of\nnecessary measures to remedy the deficiencies in the DOC's system for the delivery of mental\nhealth treatment.  Such a delay would leave the class members without necessary care and\nincrease the chance that untreated mentally ill patients would harm themselves or others.  (See\nClass Counsel Decl. at 4).  It is prudent at this time to accept the Settlement since the potential\ncosts of the trial in time and resources is outweighed by the benefits of the Settlement.\nThe second Girsh factor requires an analysis of the reaction of the class to the settlement.\nAs noted supra at V(A), the Court is satisfied that the class members' responses, when viewed\ncollectively, endorse the Settlement.\nThe fourth Girsh factor concerns the risks of establishing liability.  The Plaintiffs\nacknowledge that there are significant risks in establishing liability.  In addition, they also\nacknowledge that the Prison Litigation Reform Act, (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. §1997, places limits on\nthe scope of relief for prisoners in federal court.  Class counsel believe they could have prevailed,\nbut the risks were significant.  (See Class Counsel Decl. at 11-12).  A settlement of this type\navoids such risks.  The Settlement is also otherwise compliant with the PLRA.\nThe fifth factor, the risk of establishing damages, is not applicable here because Plaintiffs\nonly sought injunctive relief.  Therefore, this factor does not disfavor settlement.\nThe seventh Girsh factor is the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment.\n18\n\nThe DOC defendants are government employees.  The ability of a governmental unit to withstand\na greater judgment is not particularly applicable and is not a factor considered by this Court.\nThe eighth factor is whether the Settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible\nrecovery after a trial.  The Settlement achieves most of what Plaintiffs could have hoped to\naccomplish through an order following a trial.  It grants relief addressing the central problems\nasserted in this litigation.  The Settlement amended the DOC's disciplinary regulations to allow\nfor the consideration of mental illness in its proceedings.  The Settlement will create other\navenues of treatment for mentally ill patients besides psychotropic medications.  The Settlement\nwill substantially enlarge the mental health staff and require the maintenance of certain prisoner-\nstaff ratios.  It also calls for yearly mental health training for each correctional officer.  The\nSettlement also creates a more efficient information system to track the. status of each class\nmember's health.  Finally, it provides for a qualified mental health expert to ensure compliance.\nThe last factor to consider is the range of reasonableness of the Settlement to a possible\nrecovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.  The Settlement establishes a greatly\nimproved system for addressing the needs and problems of mentally ill prisoners in New Jersey.\nGiven the extent to which  Plaintiffs achieved their ultimate goals, there is no reason for  Plaintiffs\nto incur the risks of litigation by proceeding with a lengthy trial.  Therefore, the Court finds that\nthe Settlement is a fair, reasonable and entirely adequate resolution for Plaintiffs, considering the\nattendant risks ot litigation and the marginal additional relief possible from a favorable outcome.\nThe In re General Motors analysis used the present value of the damage award as a\ncomparison against the present value of the potential award minus the risks of litigation.  Unlike the\nIn re General Motors case, the instant case does not easily lend itself to a present value calculation\n19\n\nbecause the main remedy sought was injunctive relief. Therefore, this Court will look at the\nreasonableness of the Settlement as compared to the potential maximum recovery through litigation\nwhile taking into account the risks facing Plaintiffs.\nIn part, the Settlement creates three new mental care units and provides for a larger staff with\nbetter training.  The Settlement also was contingent on the State of New Jersey funding\n$16,000,000, to implement the various elements of the agreements, which it allocated in this year's\nbudget.  The Court finds that $16,000,000 is sufficient for the implementation of the entire\nSettlement.  The Settlement was within the range of the best possible recovery for the Plaintiffs.\nThere are also risks and costs associated with continuing the litigation.  There are risks that\nPlaintiffs would lose or achieve less than this Settlement at the completion of litigation.  Some costs\nof the litigation, which are essentially unquantifiable, include damage to the class members' mental\nhealth due to a lack of adequate mental health treatment during the protracted litigation and the\nincrease'd risks of injuries or death to class members or others. Additionally, attorneys fees, and\ncosts, as well as the Court's time and resources, would be substantial.  Therefore, this Court finds\nthat the value of immediate mental health service and care to the class outweighs the potential\nmaximum benefit to the class in light of the risks and costs of litigation.\nAccording to the principles set forth in the In re General Motors, this Court finds that the\nSettlement is a \"good value\" for Plaintiffs' case. The Settlement falls within the best possible\nrecovery Plaintiffs could hope for in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.  Additionally, unlike\nthe In re General Motors case, this Settlement was agreed upon after three years of litigation, with\nextensive discovery and a great deal of development of the merits of the case with which this Court\nis intimately familiar.  This Settlement represents a compromise between the parties, where\n20\n\nPlaintiffs yielded their highest hopes of achievements in exchange for certainty and resolution.\nTherefore, this Court concludes that this Settlement adheres to the principles outlined by the Third\nCircuit Court of Appeals in the In re General Motors decision.\nVIII.  REASONABLENESS OF FEES AND COSTS\n42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) allows the prevailing party in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action to recover\nreasonable attorneys fees and costs.  \"To qualify as a prevailing party, a civil rights plaintiff must\nobtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim. The plaintiff must obtain an  enforceable\njudgment against the defendants . . . through a consent decree or a settlement.\"  Alexander v.\nBoyd, 113 F.3d 1373, 1388 (4th Cir. 1997) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111, 113\n(1992)).  As discussed throughout this Memorandum of Opinion, Plaintiffs achieved substantial\nrelief on the merits through the Settlement.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the Plaintiff class\nwas the prevailing party in this litigation.\nThe calculation of the amount of attorneys fees is normally calculated by determining the\n\"lodestar.\"  The \"lodestar\" is the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the\napplicable hourly market rate for legal service.  Hensley v. Eckernart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).\nSection 803(d) of Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. §1997e(d)(3),  places a cap\non the size of attorneys fees.  The award of attorneys fees shall be based on an hourly rate no\ngreater than 150% of the hourly rate allowable under 18 U.S.C. § 3OO6(A). (The Criminal Justice\nAct).  Martin vrHadix,  527 U.S. -,  119 S.Ct.  1998 (1999).  Additionally, § 803(d) only limits\n\"attorney fees with respect to ...  services performed after the PLRA's effective date but it does\nnot so limit fees . . . before the effective date.\"  Id. at 2000.\nThe fees awarded in the instant case are well within the PLRA guidelines.  The class\n21\n\ncounsel completed approximately 13,860 hours of work.  The current hourly rate under §\n3006(A) in the District of New Jersey is $75, which comes to $112.50 after the multiplier of the\nPLRA, therefore establishing a total cap of approximately $1,559,250.  (75*1.50*13,860).  This\ncap does not account for the hours worked before the enactment of the PLRA, which is not\nlimited in the hourly fee charged nor fees permitted by the ADA.\nThe Settlement grants $1,220,000 to class counsel, including costs.  This is well below the\ncap allowed under the PLRA.  Defendants do not object to this amount, and they negotiated it at\narms length after the substantive Settlement had been consummated.  The Court is not permitted\nto \"decrease a fee award based on factors not raised at all by the adverse party.\"  See Rode v.\nDellarciprete,  829 F.2d 1177, 1183 (3d Cir. 1989) (citing Bell v. United Princeton Properties,\nInc.,  884 F.2d 713 ( 3d Cir. 1989)).  Therefore, the Court finds that the agteement on attorneys\nfees is reasonable.  '\nIX.  CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court finds that the Settlement is fair,\nreasonable, and adequate.  The Court further finds that the Settlement provides for a significant\nmodernization of mental health treatment in New Jersey State Prisons, that would not have been\nrealized but for this litigation.  In addition, the Court finds that the resolution of attorneys fees\nand costs is reasonable, given the work expended and the result achieved.  Finally, the Court\nfinds that both the Settlement benefitting the Class and the settlement on fees and costs are within\nthe restrictions imposed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\n22\n\nAccordingly, the Court will file the following Orders and Stipulations along with this\nMemorandum Opinion:\n(1) \"Order entering Judgment and Dismissal with Prejudice\",\n(2) \"Order of Dismissal as to Defendant, Correctional Behavioral Solutions of New Jersey,\nInc.\",\n(3) \"Stipulation of Dismissal as to Defendant Correctional Behavioral Solutions of New\nJersey, Inc.\",\n(4) \"Order of Dismissal with Prejudice as to Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\"\n(5) \"Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice as to Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\",\n(6) \"Order of Dismissal as to All Crossclaims\", and\n(7) \"Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice with respect to all Cross Claims.\"\nX.  POSTSCRIPT\nFrom April 19, 1996 to July 27, 1999, the Court conducted approximately forty-three (43)\nconferences (telephonic or in person) and Court hearings in this case.  At least eleven (11)\nconferences were devoted to settlement negotiations where the Court required the participation of,\nalong with the attorneys and experts, representatives of the DOC (including the Commissioner),\nCMS and CBS.  This Settlement is the result.\nEvery day, in various prisons throughout this State, professional correctional  officers\nstruggle to maintain order while the vast majority of inmates struggle to serve out their time\nwithout incident.  The Court firmly believes that this Settlement, though not perfect, will provide\nbasic modern mental health treatment for those inmates who require it.  The Court further\nbelieves that the Monitor will insure that the privatization of health services in New Jersey State\n23\n\nPrisons will enhance, not diminish, effective mental health treatment.  This Settlement should also\nhave a positive effect on the general prison population by assisting officers and inmates in their\ncontinuing struggle to \"get through the day.\"\nThe Court commends all the attorneys for their hard work and professionalism, the experts\nfor their assistance to the Court, the representatives of the DOC, CMS, and CBS for their\nmeaningful involvement in the process, and particularly the class members for their many\nthoughtful and straightforward comments regarding the Settlement.\nl<\\«n\nDated:\n24\n\nPLAINTIFFS' COMMENTS TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN C.F. V. TERHUNE\nYou are invited to comment on the proposed settlement in C.F. v. Terhune. In order for\nthe Court to consider your comments in deciding whether to approve the settlement agreement,\nyour comments must be post marked by June 25, 1999. Comments and/or questions concerning\nthe proposed settlement should be sent to the following address, using the regular prison\nprocedures for legal mail:\nSteven Vaccaro, Esq.\nDebevoise & Plimpton\n875 Third Avenue\nNew York, NY 10022\nAs your comments will be shared with the Court and opposing counsel, please remember\nthat your comments will NOT  be considered privileged attorney-client communications.\nYou may use the remainder of this page to comment or you may attach separate pages to\nexpress your comments.\nName:\nPrison Identification Number:\nAddress:\n\n\n\nSettlement Summary\nThe following is a summary of the proposed settlement agreed to by the\nparties in C.F. v. Terhune, a class action suit brought on behalf of mentally ill prisoners\nagainst officials of the Department of Corrections, Correctional Medical Services, Inc.,\nand Correctional Behavioral Solutions of New Jersey, Inc. The suit brought claims\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §  1983 for alleged violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, 29 U.S.C. § 504 (the Rehabilitation Act),\n42 U.S.C. § 12131 (the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990), and breach of contract\nclaims.  As part of their requested relief, Plaintiffs sought widespread changes to the\ndelivery of  mental health care provided to mentally ill prisoners, and disciplinary process\nas it relates to mentally ill prisoners.\nThe purpose of this summary is to give class members a better\nunderstanding of the basic elements of the settlement  The description below is not\nintended to alter in any manner the Proposed Settlement Agreement (\"the\nAgreement\"), and this document will be given no weight in interpreting the\nAgreement.  The summary does not contain a complete description of all aspects of\nthe Agreement, and does not discuss certain parts of the Agreement at all.  Please\nreview the Agreement to learn the full details of the settlement\nsummary.wpd\n\nThe District Court will need to approve the fairness of this settlement\nbefore it can be fully implemented.  The District Court has scheduled a fairness hearing\nfor July 6, 1999, and has requested that all prisoners, who would like to comment on the\nsettlement, mail their comments to Plaintiffs' counsel by June 25, 1999.  Comments\nmailed after June 25, 1999 will not be considered by the Court in determining the fairness\nof settlement.  Accordingly, you are invited — but are not required — to submit your\ncomments to Steve Vaccaro, Esq., who is one of Plaintiffs' counsel, on the form provided\nwith this packet.  A pre-addressed envelope to Mr. Vaccaro is also enclosed for your\nconvenience.  Under the procedures set by the District Court, your comments will not be\nprotected by attorney-client privilege. Plaintiffs' counsel must collect all comments\nmailed to them and forward copies of them to the Defendants and to the Court.\nProposed Amendments to DOC Regulations\nThe Department of Corrections has agreed to change parts of its\ndisciplinary regulations.  The proposed amendments are set forth in Exhibit C of the\nAgreement.  Under the new regulations, the names of all prisoners with pending\ndisciplinary charges will be given to the mental health staff before their disciplinary\nhearings take place.  The mental health staff will tell the disciplinary hearing officers\nwhether prisoners charged with disciplinary violations are receiving mental health\ntreatment.  Based on this information, the nature of the charge against the inmate, and any\nsummary.wpd\n\nother relevant information, the hearing officer will decide whether or not to request a\npsychological or psychiatric evaluation.  The hearing officer will consider the information\ncontained in that evaluation in deciding what punishment to impose on the prisoner.  The\nprison administrator or his/her representative will also consider this information in\ndeciding any appeal.  Instead of or in addition to the sanctions which previously could be\nimposed following a finding of guilt for a disciplinary violation, hearing officers may\nalso refer a mentally ill prisoner to the mental health unit for appropriate care and\ntreatment.\nUnder the new regulations, if a prisoner is confined in disciplinary\ndetention, and suffers a deterioration in his mental health status, the mental health staff\nwill refer the matter to the prison Administrator.  The Special Administrative Segregation\nReview Committee shall release a prisoner from Administrative Segregation if  the\nprisoner has a history of mental illness and the Committee decides that his/her continued\nconfinement in administrative segregation would be harmful to that prisoner's mental\nhealth.\nProposed Plan for Mental Health Treatment\nThe Agreement includes a plan for providing enhanced mental health\nservices to prisoners, which is described in Exhibit B of the Agreement.  That plan\nincludes the following:\nsummary.wpd\n\nAll prisoners will receive a mental health assessment within 72 hours of\narrival.  Details of the assessment process can be found on pages 1-3 of\nExhibit B.\nThe DOC will create \"stabilization units\" (\"SUs\") at Northern State Prison\n(\"NSP\"), New Jersey State Prison (\"NJSP\") and Edna Mahan Correctional\nFacility for Women (\"EMCFW\"), for the purpose of treating mentally ill\nprisoners who are experiencing a mental health crisis. The decision\nwhether to place a prisoner in an SU, and when to release him or her, will\nbe made by mental health staff.  Prisoners will generally stay in the units\nfor a period of 3-10 days. Details about these units can be found on pages\n3-8 of Exhibit B.\nThe DOC will also create  Residential Treatment Units (\"RTUs\") and\nTransitional Care Units (\"TCUs\") at NJSP, NSP,  EMCFW, and\nSouthwoods State Prison (\"SSP\").  The RTUs will provide a more\nstructured and supportive environment for mentally ill prisoners who have\nbeen discharged from an SU or cannot function effectively in the general\npopulation and will stabilize prisoners who have gone through a mental\nhealth crisis, and help them adjust to general population.  Some prisoners\nin the RTU may never adjust to general population, and will always\nremain in an RTU.  The prisoners in the RTU will be allowed out of their\nsummary.wpd\n\ncells for as much time as called for by the prisoners' mental health needs.\nThe TCUs will help less severely mentally ill prisoners make a gradual\nadjustment to General Population.  The decision whether to place a\nprisoner in these units, and when to release him or her, will be based on\ndeterminations made by mental health staff.  Details about these units can\nbe found in pages 8-12 of Exhibit B.\n•  The Department of Corrections will ensure that there is enough staff to\nprovide mental health services to the prisoners who are discharged from\nthe special units described above, and for the rest of the prison population,\nwho require some form of mental health services. Mental health staff will\ncontinue to make rounds in administrative segregation units at least once\nevery ten days.  The staffing which will be used to provide these services\nis described on page 12 of Exhibit C.\n•  Prisoners who are civilly committed at any point during their incarceration\nwill continue to receive mental health treatment at the Forensic Psychiatric\nHospital.\n•  Corrections officers, internal affairs investigators, disciplinary hearing\nofficers and administrators will receive additional training in mental\nillness and dealing with mentally ill prisoners.  In particular, all\ncorrectional officers staffed on the SUs, RTUs and TCUs will receive\nsummary.wpd\n\nadvanced training.  The details of this training can be found at pages 13-14\nof Exhibit C.\nPolicies and Procedures\nThe DOC agrees to review, or create if not currently existing, a variety of\npolicies and procedures, described on pages 14-16 of the Agreement as well as\nsuccessfully implement these policies and procedures.\nMonitoring and Enforcement\n•  This suit will not be dismissed until the Defendants certify that they have\nreceived enough funding to pay for the mental health care and training\ndescribed above through the Fiscal Year 2000. Governor Whitman has\nrecommended that the legislature appropriate $16,000,000.00 for fiscal\nyear 2000 to fund the services contained in the Plan for mental health\ntreatment.  If the DOC does not obtain this funding, Plaintiffs will have\nthe option of agreeing to an amended plan, or of continuing this suit.  If\nPlaintiffs agree to an amended plan, the amended plan will then be\nsubmitted to the District Court for another fairness hearing.  Prisoners will\nhave an opportunity to comment on the amended plan at that time.  The\neffect of funding on this Agreement is described on pages 10-13 of the\nAgreement.\nsummary.wpd\n\nIf the DOC certifies that it has received full funding by July 9, 1999, the\ncase will be dismissed, and the DOC will continue to carry out the Plan.\nThe schedule for putting the Plan into effect is described on pages 13-14\nof the Agreement.\nDr. Patterson, a forensic psychiatrist, will be appointed as an independent\nmental health expert to oversee the Defendants' compliance with the terms\nof the Settlement.  For details, see Agreement at pages 17-18.\nDr. Patterson will inspect New Jersey Department of Corrections facilities\nfour times a year, for five days.  He will be able to interview inmates and\nstaff members during the inspections.  He will also receive certain DOC\ndocuments. For details, see Agreement at pages 19-23 and 43-49.\nAfter the inspection, Dr. Patterson will write a report, explaining whether\nthe DOC has substantially complied with the terms of the Settlement.  The\nDOC does not have to provide perfect treatment in order to substantially\ncomply with the terms of the Settlement.  If the DOC has not substantially\ncomplied with certain terms of the Settlement,  it may have a limited\nnumber of chances to fix the problem.  A description of the issues Dr.\nPatterson's report will address as well as the definition of substantial\ncompliance and noncompliance that he will be required to apply during his\ninspections is set forth in the Agreement on pages 23-27. The monitor's\nsummary.wpd\n\nreport will be confidential, except in circumstances described on pages 33-\n36.  Prisoners will not have access to it.\n•  If prisoners have a concern regarding mental health care, they may submit\ntheir grievances directly to Thomas Farrell, Director of the Health Services\nUnit, Whittlesey Rd., P.O. Box 863, Trenton, NJ 08625, who will be\nresponsible for addressing those complaints  and/or copy Steve Vaccaro,\nEsq., who is one of Plaintiffs' counsel, at Debevoise & Plimpton, 875\nThird Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022.  All documents related to these\ncomplaints will be sent to Dr. Patterson, as well as to contractors\nproviding medical and mental health services. This process is described at\npage 50 of the Agreement.\n•  When Dr. Patterson decides that the DOC is in compliance with one of the\ncategories described on page 24 of the Agreement for 12 months, he will\nnot report on or review that category any longer as set forth on pages 50-\n51.  When the DOC has been in continuous substantial compliance with\nall categories, the Settlement will terminate.\n•  Plaintiffs, through their class counsel, can sue to enforce this agreement in\nNew Jersey state court.  No other individual or group of prisoners may sue\nto enforce the terms of this agreement, and Plaintiffs' counsel may not\nsummary.wpd\n\nbring such a suit unless Dr. Patterson finds that the DOC is not complying\nwith it.  The Agreement discusses such a suit on pages 54-56.\nLiability\nThis is a settlement agreement between the Plaintiffs and the DOC. The\nDOC makes no admission of liability as to Plaintiffs' claims as described on pages 52-53.\nPlaintiffs have agreed on page 6 of the Agreement to dismiss their claims against CMS\nand CBS with prejudice.\nAttorneys' Fees\nAs part of this Agreement, the DOC will pay Plaintiffs' counsel a total of\n$1,220,000.00 for the costs of bringing, and working on, this suit.\nsummary.wpd\n\nResumen de Transaction\nLo siguiente es un resumen del propuesto convenio de transaction acordado\npor las personas involucradasen el caso, C.F. v.

COMPLAINT\nWILLIAM F. FAUVER, GARY J. HILTON,\nHOWARD L. BEYER, EUGENE F. O'NEILL,\nJOHN FORKER,  DR. THOMAS FARRELL,\nDR. RICHARD CEVASCO,  CORRECTIONAL MEDICAL\nSERVICES, INC., AND CORRECTIONAL BEHAVIORAL\nSOLUTIONS OF NEW JERSEY, INC.\nDEFENDANTS.\nPlaintiffs, by their attorneys, allege as follows, upoti personal belief as\nto themselves and on information and belief as to all other matters:\nPRELIMINARY  STATEMENT\n1.  This is a class action brought by plaintiffs on behalf of a class\nconsisting of themselves and all persons who suffer DSM IV, Axis I and/or Axis II\ndisordera such that they are unable to meet the functional requirements of prison life\nExhibit  A\n30272S0C.03\n\nwithout mental health treatment, who now or in the future will be confined within the\nfacilities of the New Jersey Department of Corrections (the \"Class\").  The Court\ncertified the Class in an order dated November 20, 1996.\n2.  The plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the\nEightii and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, 29 U.S.C. § 504\n(the Rehabilitation Act), and  42 U.S.C. § 12132 (the Americans with Disabilities Act\nof 1990).  Defendants William F. Fauver, Gary J. Hilton, Howard L. Beyer, Eugene\nF. O'Neill, John Forker, Dr. Thomas Farrell and Dr. Richard Cevasco (hereinafter,\ncollectively referred to as \"the DOC defendants\") are New Jersey State government\nofficials who are responsible for the  housing, treatment services, discipline and health\ncare for Class members within the facilities of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections (\"DOC\").  Defendant Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (\"CMS\") is\nresponsible, pursuant to a contract wim DOC, for carrying out DOC's obligation to\nprovide medical, psychological and psychiatric services to Class members.  Defendant\nCorrectional Behavioral Solutions of New*Jersey, Inc., (\"CBS\") is responsible under a\nsubcontract with CMS for carrying out DOC's and CMS's obligations to provide\npsychological and psychiatric services to Class members.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory\nand injunctive relief to remedy die illegal and unconstitutional conditions for which the\nDOC defendants, CMS and CBS (collectively the \"Defendants\") are responsible and to\nwhich Class members are or will be subjected.  Due to the highly private and personal\n20272S0C.03\n\nnature of the facts surrounding the claims of the representative plaintiffs, only their\ninitials are used herein to protect their dignity and privacy.\n3.  This action arises from DOC's policies and practice of imposing\npunishment, rather than providing treatment, when Class members violate prison rules\nand regulations.  Through the DOC defendants' deliberate indifference, Class members\nare placed in facilities referred to as disciplinary detention and administrative\nsegregation, where they are locked in their cells for over 23 hours a day for alleged\ndisciplinary infractions resulting from their serious mental disorders.  Class members\nassigned to administrative segregation remain there, isolated and virtually untreated,\noften for years at a time.\n4.  Even the most hardened offenders generally are able to adjust to\nprison life and avoid receiving administrative segregation time.  Because Class\nmembers do not receive adequate mental health care, they find it extremely difficult or\nimpossible to comply with institutional rules, the violation of which may subject them\nto discipline.  Class members are often sentenced to disciplinary detention and/or\nadministrative segregation aftet breaking those rules.  Once confined in administrative\nsegregation, these prisonen are even less able to conform to prison rules because their\nmental conditions worsen.  As a result, they receive additional disciplinary charges and\noften additional administrative segregation time, leading to a further deterioration in\ntheir mental conditions.  In addition, the accrual of disciplinary sanctions ultimately\naoa7aso«.oa\n\ncauses Class members to spend more time in prison by delaying their parole eligibility\ndate, thus reducing the likelihood that Class members will receive parole and delaying\ntheir ultimate release date.\n5.  In administrative segregation, Class members have minimal\ncontact with other prisoners or with custody staff and may leave meir cell only for a\ndaily shower and a few hours of outdoor recreation each week.  The most severely\nmentally ill prisoners are housed on the first floor of each of the units, known as\n\"flats.\"  Severely depressed or delusional prisoners are stripped of clothing (except for\na paper gown) and bedding, sometimes for weeks at a time.  Due to their mental\ndisorders, some Class members become increasingly unable to care for themselves, fail\nto shower, and smear themselves and their cells with feces and urine.\n6.  Defendants have equipped each of the prisons with restraining\nchairs to punish psychotic behavior.  Defendants permit untrained officers to administer\nthese and other mechanical means of behavioral control without adequate supervision\nby trained mental health personnel.\n7.  Defendants rail to provide Class members with constitutionally\nadequate and appropriate mental health care.  DOC's few designated housing units for\nmentally ill prisoners are insufficient in number, unavailable to female prisoners\naltogether, and generally not available to prisoners with records of disciplinary\ninfractions.\n20372S0«.03\n\n8..  The effects of this system of punishment have been devastating to\nthe representative plaintiffs.\n•  Plaintiffs A.O., D.M. and J.W. have numerous scars from suicide\nattempts in administrative segregation.\n•  Plaintiff A.O. once resorted to swallowing a belt buckle and another\ntime set herself on fire in a desperate plea for help.\n•  Plaintiff J.W., a twenty-one-year-old nonviolent offender,  has spent the\nlast five years in administrative segregation.  When he is charged with a\ndisciplinary infraction, he is often placed in a dry cell without lights,\nwithout a toilet that flushes and without water.\n•  Plaintiff D.M., now committed to FPH, is terrified  at the prospect of\nbeing returned to administrative segregation.  She is fearful  of the\ncorrections  officers and the other prisoners in administrative\nsegregation.\n•  Plaintiff L.K. has difficulty distinguishing persons trying to help him\nfrom those trying to hurt him.  His mental disorder is such that\ntraditional sanctions do not deter his behavior.\n9.  The DOC defendants have known for years that a substantial\nnumber of prisoners in administrative segregation have serious mental disorders.\nIndeed, as long as a decade ago, the New Jersey State legislature, recognizing both the\nprevalence of mental illness in State prisons and the lack of adequate mental health care\ntherein, directed DOC to make adequate and appropriate treatment available.  The\nDOC defendants nave refused to modify DOC's disciplinary policies to take mental\ndisorders into account, to provide the Class with treatment and housing that\n203T2S0C.03\n\naccommodate their needs, or to provide adequate mental health staffing to deliver\nmeaningful  treatment to the Class.\n10.  The DOC defendants are aware that their disciplinary policies and\npractices exacerbate the mental disorders of Class members. Yet they continue to\nabdicate their statutory obligations and to violate the constitutional rights of Class\nmembers by failing to provide them with adequate and appropriate care and treatment.\nJURISDICTION\n11.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this lawsuit\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a) and 1367(a).\n12.  Venue in the District of New Jersey is proper.  Plaintiffs reside\nin the District of New Jersey, and all events relevant to this action occurred in the\nDistrict of New Jersey.\nPlaintiffs\n13.  The representative plaintiffs are citizens of the United States with\nserious mental disorders who are confined in New Jersey state prisons.  These facilities\nare operated by and under the control of the DOC, CBS and CMS.\n14.  The representative plaintiffs are \"handicapped\" individuals as that\nterm is defined in 29 U.S.C. § 706(8)(B) and 42 U.S.C. § 12102.\n15.  DOC receives federal financial assistance.\n20272S04.03\n\n16.  A.O. is a prisoner currently confined to Northern State Prison's\nadministrative segregation unit for women in Newark, New Jersey.  A.O. has been\ndiagnosed by DOC psychiatrists as suffering from schizophrenia, adjustment disorder\nand multiple personality disorder, and she also suffers from seizures as a result of a\nstroke which she experienced at age fifteen.  Her mental illness makes it difficult  for\nher to control her behavior.  She has received numerous disciplinary charges, including\nseveral for self-mutilation, drug overdoses and assaults on correctional staff.  While\nhoused in administrative segregation at Northern State Prison -  for over four of the last\nfive years — A.O. has attempted suicide or engaged in self-mutilation approximately 15\ntimes.  Although she attempted to explain the role her mental disorder played in her\nsuicidal behavior at her disciplinary hearings, she received additional time in both\ndisciplinary detention and administrative segregation as a result of her suicidal\nbehavior.  On several occasions, A.O.'s behavior reached an acute crisis and she was\ntransferred to the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital (\"FPH\") in Trenton, New Jersey, only\nto be returned to administrative segregation upon release from FPH.\n17.  J.W. is 9 prisoner currently assigned to the administrative\nsegregation unit of New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey.  Except for brief\ncommitments to the FPH, J.W. has been in virtual isolation in administrative\nsegregation for nearly six years, since he was 16 years old.  He suffers from schizo-\naffective disorder, a borderline personality disorder and an antisocial personality\n20272S0C.03\n\ndisorder.  While incarcerated at New Jersey State Prison, J.W. has received no\npsychiatric or psychological treatment except for psychotropic medications.  He has\nattempted suicide on numerous occasions, and has been committed to FPH\napproximately eight times.  As a result of actions stemming from J.W.'s inability to\ncontrol his frustration and anger at being isolated, he has on several occasions been\nplaced by prison officials in a \"dry cell\" -  a cell without lights or running water from\nwhich urine and feces are removed on approximately a weekly basis -  for generally\ntwo to three weeks at a time.  On other occasions, prison officials have responded to\nhis suicide attempts by transferring him to a \"strip cell\", an empty cell where no\nclothes are permitted, or to a \"restraining chair\" where his hands are cuffed either to\nhis sides or behind his back and his feet are shackled to the chair.\n18.  L.K. is a prisoner currently assigned to the administrative\nsegregation unit of New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jerssy.  He has been\ndiagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, antisocial personality disorder, organic mood\ndisorder, explosive personality disorder and paranoid personality disorder.  As a result\nof his mental condition, L.K. has on several occasions struck corrections officers\nbelieving that the officers intended to harm him.  Prison officials have committed L.K.\nto FPH on five occasions, yet have failed to provide L.K. with appropriate follow-up\ntreatment upon his release from FPH.\n8\n20272S0C.03\n\n19.  D.M. is a prisoner currently assigned to the administrative\nsegregation unit of Northern State Prison in Newark, New Jersey.  She has been\ndiagnosed by psychiatrists at FPH as suffering from recurrent major depression,\nadjustment disorder, histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder and\nacute paranoid disorder.  Since her transfer to administrative segregation, she has\nmutilated her arms and wrists with sharp objects on at least eight occasions and has\nbeen placed in a restraining chair and in a strip cell as punishment.  She also has been\ncommitted repeatedly to FPH where she currently remains.\n20.  Defendant William F.

CMS offers \"managed health care services.\"  Managed health\ncare is a system of health care delivery with the principal goal of reducing health care\ncost by imposing limits on access to non-contracted care providers.  Defendant CMS\n12\n20272SOC.03\n\nhas entered into a contract with DOC, pursuant to which CMS is responsible for\ncarrying out DOC's responsibilities to provide medical, psychological and psychiatric\nservices for prisoners in DOC's facilities.  Defendant CMS has breached its contract\nwith DOC and, acting under color of state law, has continued DOC's practices of\nproviding inadequate mental health care to Class members since it assumed\nresponsibility for providing all psychiatric and psychological services to prisoners\nconfined in DOC facilities.\n28.  Defendant CBS is a private corporation, incorporated in New\nJersey, which provides behavioral health services to prisoners in jails and prisons.\nDefendant CBS has its corporate offices at 3000 Atrium Way, Mt. Laurel, NJ 08054.\nCBS has entered into a subcontract with defendant CMS pursuant to which CBS is\nresponsible for carrying out defendant CMS's and DOC's responsibilities to provide\nmental health services to prisoners in DOC's facilities.  Defendant CBS has breached\nits subcontract with CMS and, acting under color of state law, has continued DOC's\npractices of providing inadequate mental health care to Class members since its\nassumption on August 19, 1996 of responsibility for providing all mental health\nservices to prisoners confined in DOC facilities.\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS\n29.  Pursuant to Rule 23 (a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the representative plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf, and on\n13\n20272SOC.03\n\nbehalf of the Class, consisting of  all persons who suffer DSM IV, Axis I and/or Axis\nII disorders such that they are unable to meet the functional requirements of prison life\nwithout mental health treatment, who now or in the future will be confined within the\nfacilities of the New Jersey Department of Corrections.\n(a)  There are approximately 22,000 state prisoners incarcerated in\nstate prison facilities managed by DOC.  Numerous studies have been conducted to\ndetermine the prevalence of mental disorders among prison inmates in the United\nStates.  The most recent prevalence studies have found that between eight and nineteen\npercent of the total prison population have significant psychiatric or functional\ndisabilities.  SS£ Jeffrey L. Metzner, Guidelines for Psychiatric Services In Prisons,\nCriminal Behavior and Mental Health, 3, 252-267 (Whurr 1993).  Thus, it is estimated\nthat there are approximately 1700 to 4100 persons in DOC facilities who have serious\nmental disorders.  Many of these mentally ill prisoners have been, currently are, or will\nin the foreseeable future be, confined in DOC's disciplinary detention and/or\nadministrative segregation facilities, often as a result of the DOC defendants' failure to\nmodify DOC's disciplinary system to adequately address the special circumstances of\nmentally ill prisoners, and to provide adequate and appropriate mental health care and\nspecial needs housing.  The Class is thus so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.\n14\n2037250*.01\n\n(b)  The conditions, practices and omissions diat form the\nbasis of this Complaint are commpn to all Class members, and the relief sought will\napply to all of them.\n(c)  The claims of the representative plaintiffs are typical of\nthe claims of the entire Class.  The representative plaintiffs and Class members all have\nserious mental disorders, have been, currently are, or will in the foreseeable future be\nconfined within DOC's disciplinary detention and administrative segregation units, and\nare not receiving adequate mental health care and treatment or rehabilitative activities\nin violation of die Americans With Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n(d)  The representative plaintiffs are capable, through counsel,\nof fairly and adequately representing the Class and protecting its interests.\n(e)  The prosecution of separate actions by individual Class\nmembers would create a risk of inconsistent and varying adjudications which would\nestablish inconsistent and incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants.\n(f)  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to die Class, making appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief\nwith respect to die Class as a whole.\n(g)  There are questions of law and fact common to Class\nmembers, including Defendants' violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the\n15\n30272S0C.03\n\nRehabilitation Act, and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution by (1) failing to identify prisoners with serious mental disorders; (2)\npunishing Class members for actions which are manifestations of their mental disorders\nwithout taking into account the role that their disorders play in the charged conduct; (3)\nsubjecting Class to disciplinary hearings notwithstanding their incompetency to\nparticipate in such hearings; (4) placing Class members in disciplinary detention and\nadministrative segregation units despite DOC's knowledge that the conditions of\ndisciplinary detention and administrative segregation are counter-therapeutic and lead to\nthe deterioration of the mental conditions of Class members; (5) failing to provide\nClass members with adequate and appropriate mental health treatment; (6) failing to\ntrain corrections officers to recognize the signs of mental illness and respond\nprofessionally to the special needs of Class members; (7) failing to provide adequate\nand appropriate special needs housing for Class members; (8) failing to enforce DOC's\ncontract with defendants CBS and CMS; and (9) failing to perform the duties set forth\nin the CMS contract and the CBS subcontract\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n30.  As set forth in paragraphs 31 through 82 below, the DOC\ndefendants* disciplinary and behavioral control practices and procedures, administered\nwithout regard to their effect on the mental health condition of Class members,\ncombined with Defendants' failure to provide adequate mental health care to Class\n16\n20272S0C.0)\n\nmembers while they are confined to administrative segregation and disciplinary\ndetention facilities, result in intolerable suffering, deterioration in the mental health\nstatus of Class members, and the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\nDisciplinary Process\n31.  All prisoners within DOC facilities are required to abide by a\nseries of prison rules.  If a prisoner violates a rule, corrections officers must complete a\nDisciplinary Report and submit the report to the appropriate supervisor.  N.J.A.C.\n10A:4-9. l(a).  In the case of \"serious\" offenses, the supervisor then forwards the\nreport to the facility's Disciplinary Hearing Officer or Adjustment Committee\n(\"hearing officers\").  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-9.1(b).  A prisoner so charged is entitled to a\nprompt hearing before a hearing officer to explain his or her version of the facts\nleading to the disciplinary charge.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-9.8(b); N.J.A.C. 10A-9.8(c);\nN.J.A.C.  10A-9.14.\n32.  Hearing officers, who are employees of DOC and are acting\nunder the direction of, and pursuant to policies set by, defendants Fauver and O'Neill,\nmay \"sentence\" prisoners to one or more regulatory punishments, depending on the\nseverity of the offense, including:  verbal reprimand; loss of privileges; disciplinary\ndetention; administrative segregation; and loss of commutation time which is awarded\nfor good behavior.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-5.1.  DOC's disciplinary detention and\n17\n20272S0C.03\n\nadministrative segregation facilities house prisoners charged with or found guilty of\n\"serious\" disciplinary  infractions.\n33.  When considering a disciplinary charge against a prisoner,\nhearing officers are required to make individualized determinations that take into\naccount the circumstances surrounding the prisoner's adverse behavior, the prisoner's\naccountability for such behavior and the underlying reasons for the prisoner's\nnoncompliance with prison rules.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-9.17.  Despite this mandate,\nhearing officers routinely fail to assess the role that mental illness has played in the\nconduct at issue or to take the mental health status of the prisoner into account in\ndetermining either guilt or the appropriate sanction.\n34.  In some cases, hearing officers have acknowledged the role that a\nprisoner's mental disorder played in the conduct charged, but nevertheless imposed\nsubstantial sanctions anyway, including disciplinary detention and administrative\nsegregation.\n35.  As a result of DOC's disciplinary procedures and practices, Class\nmembers have been punished fpr displaying symptoms of their disorders and for\nconduct over which they have no control.  For example:\n(a)  Plaintiff A.O. has been repeatedly sentenced to disciplinary\ndetention and administrative segregation for self-mutilation and suicide attempts.\n18\n20372S0C.03\n\n(b)  In another case which is the subject of a pending federal\ncourt lawsuit, a member of the Class alleges that he sought professional assistance\nbecause he heard voices telling him to leave the perimeter of the prison.  Instead of\nreceiving mental health treatment, the prisoner was punished with administrative\nsegregation for planning an escape.\n(c)  Another prisoner incurred a series of disciplinary charges\nresulting in administrative segregation time after being denied his prescribed psycho-\ntropic medications for three weeks.\nDetention and Administrative Segregation Facilities\nDetention\n36.  As described in paragraph 32, prisoners who are found guilty of\nprison infractions deemed \"serious\" are subject to a number of potential punishments,\nincluding disciplinary detention and administrative segregation.  All DOC prisons\ncontain disciplinary detention units.  Sfi& N.J.A.C. 10A:5-1.3.  In most prisons, die\ndisciplinary detention units are separate frfm the general prison population.  Those\nprisons without a separate disoiplinary detention area utilize the prisoner's own cell as a\ndisciplinary detention unit  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-10.1-10.3.\n37.  Disciplinary detention facilities are used to house prisoners\ntemporarily after they have been charged with or found guilty of an infraction.\nN.J.A.C. 10A:4-10.1, 10.2.  Prisoners may be sentenced to 15 days in disciplinary\n19\n303?3S0«.01\n\ndetention for each offense, N.J.A.C. 10A:4-5.4; N.J.A.C. 10A:4-10.2, provided that\nthe total time served does not exceed 30 days.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-5.4(a)(l); N.J.A.C.\n10A:4-10.2.\n38.  While in disciplinary detention, prisoners are kept in isolation\nand are permitted to shower only once every three to four days.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-10.6.\nThey are not permitted visitors, contact with other prisoners, telephone calls, personal\npossessions or to leave their cells for meals.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-10.6; N.J.A.C. 10A:4-\n10.13.\nAdministrative Segregation\n39.  Administrative segregation units are used for the confinement of\nprisoners who have been found guilty of disciplinary infractions.  Se£ 10A:5-1.3.\nUnlike disciplinary detention, however, prisoners can be sentenced to administrative\nsegregation for up to a year for each disciplinary offense.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-5. l(a).\nOnce confined to administrative segregation, it is not unusual for Class members to\nincur additional disciplinary charges.  As a*result, some Class members are confined in\nadministrative segregation for years at a time.\n40.  DOC administrative segregation units are located at Northern\nState Prison in Newark, New Jersey, East Jersey State Prison in Rahway, New Jersey,\nNew Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey and the Albert Wagner Youth\nCorrectional Facility in Bordentown, New Jersey.  The sole women's administrative\n20\n203T2SOC.03\n\nsegregation unit is located within the men's prison at Northern State Prison.  DOC has\na total of  approximately 1100 administrative segregation cells at these four facilities.\n41.  Although prisoners within administrative segregation are allowed\ncertain privileges not permitted prisoners in disciplinary detention such as daily showers\nand some recreational time, the conditions in the two facilities are similar in many\nother ways.  Like prisoners in disciplinary detention, prisoners confined in\nadministrative segregation are left idle with minimal sensory stimulation.  They are\nconfined in small cells for all but three or four hours per week.  A typical cell holds a\nmetal bed, a mattress, a toilet, a sink and a footlocker.  Some of the beds are equipped\nto permit custody staff to place prisoners in four-point restraints by shackling the\nprisoner's arms and legs to the bed.  There is a narrow window in the cells for natural\nlight at all of the facilities except for New Jersey State Prison, where the cells have no\nnatural light at all.\n42.  Prisoners in administrative segregation have very little contact\nwith other human beings.  They are not permitted to work at their normal prison jobs\nor to attend programs or other rehabilitative and vocational activities, and they must\neat all their meals alone in their cell.  In addition, prisoners in administrative segre-\ngation are pennitted visitors on a more limited basis than the general prison population,\nmay not participate in organized religious services and have very limited library access.\nThe only time they are pennitted outside their cells is for a daily shower and for an\n21\n20372SOC.03\n\nhour or two of recreation two or three times per week.  Recreation generally consists of\naccess to a small concrete yard with a basketball net.\n43.  Prisoners in administrative segregation have very little contact\neven with corrections officers.  Corrections officers open and shut the cell doors using\nremote automatic controls and pass prisoners' meals through slots in the cell door\ncalled food ports.  Likewise, medications, including psychotropic drugs are delivered\nthrough the food port.\n44.  In most administrative segregation units, cell doors are solid so\nthat prisoners may speak to other prisoners only through vents or by shouting  -\nbehavior which may lead to further disciplinary charges.\n45.  Prisoners in administrative segregation are completely dependent\nupon custody staff for every need.  Some Class members must depend on corrections\nofficers even to flush their toilets.\n46.  Due to their mental disorders, some Class members never leave\ntheir cells, never shower, and smear their cells with urine and feces.\nEffect of Administrative Segregation and Disciplinary\nDetention QD C?888\n47.  The effects of administrative segregation and disciplinary\ndetention on Class members are profound.  Placement of prisoners with serious mental\n22\n20272S0C.01\n\ndisorders in disciplinary detention and/or administrative segregation exacerbates their\nunderlying mental disorders, induces psychosis, and increases the risk of suicide.\n48.  Even when Class members are transferred to FPH -  the State\ninstitution used for the confinement of the criminally insane and certain acutely\nmentally ill prisoners -  they do not receive long-term psychiatric care.  Instead,\nbecause of insufficient space at FPH and the lack of any other appropriate prison\nfacilities for the treatment and housing of Class members, DOC employees, under the\nsupervision and control of defendants Fauver, Hilton and Beyer, generally reassign\nClass members to administrative segregation once they are returned to the prison.\nOnce returned to administrative segregation, Class members are not permitted to\nparticipate in rehabilitative programs, despite FPH discharge instructions that often\nrecommend such participation.  Typically, the mental condition of such prisoners\nfurther deteriorates with each return to administrative segregation.\n49.  Although DOC does operate designated housing units for\nmentally ill male prisoners at Northern State Prison and New Jersey State Prison, Class\nmembers are generally not eligible for such housing because of their disciplinary\ninfractions.  Although these designated housing units are not punitive, prisoners in\nthese units similarly do not receive constitutionally adequate mental health care. Nor\ndo the corrections officers who work in these units receive any special training in\ndealing with the mentally ill.\n23\n20272SOC.01\n\n50..  Sentencing seriously mentally ill prisoners to disciplinary\ndetention and/or administrative detention has other adverse effects.  Time spent in\nadministrative segregation delays a prisoner's parole eligibility date because it results in\nthe loss of commutation or \"good behavior\" time,  N.J.A.C. 10A:9-5.3.  Sfifi N.J.S.A.\n30:4-123.51.  In addition, disciplinary charges reduce a prisoner's chances of being\nparoled at all.  N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.11(b)(2), (7), (10).  For example, following the\nfailure of Riverfront State Prison to provide one prisoner with his psychotropic\nmedications for a three-week period, the prisoner broke a number of prison rules and\nreceived administrative segregation time.  Because of these disciplinary infractions, the\nNew Jersey Parole Board then rescinded the prisoner's previously approved parole\ndate.\n51.  The inability of prisoners in administrative segregation to\nparticipate in jobs and rehabilitative programs also adversely affects an individual\nprisoner's parole decision, N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.11(8), (11), no matter that the failure\nwas involuntary.  The failure to panicipate'in rehabilitative programs is often cited by\nthe New Jersey Parole Board as a reason for denying parole to Class members who\nhave been assigned to administrative segregation.  Thus, Class members are more\nlikely to be required to serve their maximum sentences than are other prisoners as a\nresult of Defendants' policy of punishing rather than treating prisoners with serious\nmental disorders.\n24\n20272S0C.03\n\n52.  Finally, the consequences of placement in administrative\nsegregation do not end when Class members are released from prison.  Because such\nprisoners often serve their entire terms and are not paroled, they are unable to take\nadvantage of the mental health services afforded parolees.  Without post-release mental\nhealth services, Class members have difficulty adjusting to life outside prison, are\nunlikely to find employment, and, as a result, are more likely to return to prison.\nLack of Treatment Opportunities and Inadequate Staffing\n53.  The deterioration in the mental health condition of Class\nmembers caused by the isolation of administrative segregation and disciplinary\ndetention facilities is exacerbated by Defendants' failure to provide adequate mental\nhealth care to such prisoners before, during, and after that confinement.\n54.  As a result of the Defendants' policies and procedures, Class\nmembers have been and will in the future be deprived of necessary mental health\nservices in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, those identified in paragraphs\n55-69 below.\n55.  There are insufficient resources, including professional staffing,\nto provide appropriate mental health care for prisoners.  Despite a doubling of the\ngeneral prison population since 1986 and a corresponding increase in the number of\nmentally ill prisoners, the DOC defendants significantly reduced psychiatric staffing at\nDOC facilities over the last five years.  An August 1993 article in the fieigsn.\n25\n20372504.01\n\nreported that at New Jersey State Prison, for example, one psychiatrist -  one of only\nthree full-time psychiatrists employed by DOC statewide at that time -  supervised\nmedication for about four hundred patients, a caseload that did not permit adequate\ntime for proper monitoring of medication, let alone provision of any other treatment.\nToday, mental health staffing is so minimal that the professional staff must spend much\nof their time responding to medical emergencies, preparing parole and institutional\nassessments, and providing minimal monitoring of the administration of medication.\n56.  Inadequate professional staffing and lack of proper procedures\nprevent Defendants from properly identifying prisoners with serious mental disorders.\n57.  Inadequate staffing has and continues to cause Class members\nwho seek access to psychiatric care to experience delays in receiving that care, causing\nsevere harm to their mental conditions.  The Department of the Public Advocate (the\n\"Public Advocate\") reported that in July 1993, for example, a prisoner in\nadministrative segregation at East Jersey State Prison remained in his cell for three days\neating his own feces.  During this time, DOC did nothing to help him because the sole\nprison psychiatrist was away on vacation. Only after the intervention of an attorney\nfrom the Public Advocate did the prison arrange for the prisoner's commitment to\nFPH.\n58.  There is no comprehensive, systematic mental health quality\nassurance program in DOC's individual prisons, let alone in its administrative\n26\n202T2SOC.03\n\nsegregation facilities.  Consequently, errors in treatment and diagnosis are not\nsystematically identified or corrected.  Also, prison mental health staff under the\nsupervision of Defendants do not routinely prepare mental health treatment plans, and\nthose that are prepared are inadequate.  Moreover, mental health records often lack\nessential elements, such as recommended action, laboratory test results and frequency\nof needed follow-up care.  In addition, contacts between professional staff and\nprisoners are often not documented, and mental health records are rarely reviewed or\nupdated because of a lack of clerical support.\n59.  Defendants do not maintain a current central database to track the\nmental health treatment and placement for even the most severely mentally ill\nprisoners.\n60.  DOC has not allocated sufficient physical facilities and resources\nto provide the necessary care and treatment for Class members.  Due to the lack of\nappropriate mental health facilities within DOC prisons and a severe shortage of beds at\nthe FPH, defendants CMS and CBS fail to-commit Class members to the FPH until a\nClass member's condition constitutes an acute crisis.  Those prisoners committed to\nFPH are often discharged before it is medically appropriate to do so.  In addition,\nbecause of the lack of sufficient space at FPH, even an acute crisis does not always\nlead to a prisoner's transfer to FPH.\n27\n202T2S04.01\n\n61.  Mentally ill prisoners who are prematurely discharged from FPH\nand returned to administrative segregation often suffer from renewed psychosis or some\nother form of psychological deterioration.  For example, the  Public Advocate reported\nin a letter to defendant Beyer, dated April 5, 1994, that in late November 1993 a\nmember of the Class confined in East Jersey's administrative segregation facility set\nhimself on fire, suffering third-degree burns over thirty percent of his body.  He\nrequired hospitalization in a burn unit for many months.  Upon release from the burn\nunit, the prisoner, who suffered from severe schizophrenia, was nonetheless returned to\nadministrative segregation where he remained, incoherent, severely mentally ill, in a\ncell especially designed to prevent him from setting additional fires, for nearly three\nyears until he completed his term.  It was only at that time -  when he was to be\nreleased to the community -  that the prisoner was committed to FPH, where he\ncurrently remains.\n62.  DOC's facilities for female Class members are even more\ninadequate than those afforded male Class members.  Despite the fact that a substantial\nnumber of the women in administrative segregation at Northern State Prison have\nserious mental disorders, Edna Mahan Correctional Facility (\"EMCF\") -  DOC's only\nwomen's prison -  does not have a designated housing unit for mentally ill female\nprisoners.  Thus, although plaintiff D.M.'s mental health needs are such that she is\nsimilarly situated to the male prisoners with mental disorders housed in designated\n28\n20272S0C.03\n\nhousing units at Northern State Prison and New Jersey State Prison, she was assigned\nto general population at EMCF, rather than to a designated housing unit.  While\nassigned to the general population, she incurred disciplinary charges, was transferred to\nadministrative segregation, and experienced a devastating deterioration in her mental\nhealth condition.  Were EMCF to establish a designated unit, some of the mentally ill\nwomen currently confined in administrative segregation cells could be diverted to more\nappropriate and therapeutic housing.  Defendants are aware of the need for designated\nhousing for female Class members but have deliberately failed to take the necessary\nsteps to establish an appropriate long-term alternative to administrative segregation.\n63.  The dearth of outpatient therapy or other appropriate services for\nClass members contributes to their psychological deterioration.  Defendants' failure to\nplan and budget for outpatient mental health services is inconsistent with proven,\nacceptable mental health practices in the community and in other prison systems.\n64.  The mental health care available to Class members in\nadministrative segregation and disciplinary detention consists almost exclusively of\npsychotropic medication — medication which, by acting on the mind, is intended to\ntreat the symptoms of mental illness.  Even this limited treatment, however, is provided\nin an inadequate manner.  Defendants CMS and CBS and employees subject to their\nsupervision and control fail to explain either the necessity or side effects of\npsychotropic medications to Class members.  Many prisoners receiving such medication\n29\n20372S0C.03\n\ntherefore refuse it either because of the medication's side effects, or out of fear that the\nmedication will render them vulnerable to other prisoners and corrections officers.  The\nserious, oftentimes painful and potentialFy fatal side-effects of psychotropic medications\nare exacerbated by defendants' CMS's and CBS's failure to adequately monitor the\nadministration of medication to ensure that Class members are correctly taking their\nprescribed medications and that the medications are having their intended effect.\nAlthough many side effects of psychotropic medications may be successfully prevented\nor treated with medication, A.O., L.K., J.W. and D.M. have not received the proper\nmedications in appropriate dosages to offset these adverse effects.  Because of the lack\nof  an effective quality assurance program with respect to mental health care, as well as\ninsufficient staffing, the problems that Class members experience in taking\npsychotropic medications frequently go undetected and uncorrected.\n65.  Defendants also fail to make appropriate psychotropic medi-\ncations available to Class members.  In October 1995, for instance, psychiatrists at\nFPH determined that plaintiff A.O. should-be treated with Clozaril, a medication which\nthe FDA has approved for the treatment of schizophrenia.  However, because Northern\nState Prison does not stock Clozaril, the FPH staff decided not to begin a therapy\nwhich could not be continued upon A.O.'s return to the prison.  A.O. was thereby\ndeprived of appropriate mental health care treatment.  Defendant CBS likewise does not\ninclude Clozaril on its list of available medications for Class members.  More broadly,\n30\n20272S0C.0)\n\ndefendant CBS has recently begun changing Class members' medications by\nsubstituting less expensive drugs, despite the fact that these cheaper drugs are  less\neffective, are associated with greater side effects, and are therefore less safe than the\ndrugs formally used.\n66.  Unnecessary deaths and injuries occur because of the absence of\nsufficient staff and adequate practices to identify and monitor Class members who are\nat risk of committing suicide.  Prisoners kept in isolation attempt to commit suicide at a\nsignificantly higher rate than prisoners in the general prison population.  Defendants\nFauver, Hilton, Beyer, Forker, Farrell and Cevasco have failed to take necessary and\nappropriate measures to prevent suicide attempts among prisoners in administrative\nsegregation and disciplinary detention, including providing corrections officers with\nadequate training in the area of suicide prevention and providing a physically safe\nenvironment for prisoners at risk of suicide.\n67.  Inadequate and improper policies and practices, adopted by\nDefendants, are used by DOC custody staff to restrain Class members in either strip\ncells or mechanical restraints such as restraining chairs and so-called \"four point\"\nrestraints.  The decision to so restrain Class members is often made by prison\nadministrators and custody staff, sometimes without adequate input by mental health\nprofessionals.  As a result, the mental health of these prisoners is not adequately\nconsidered in this decision.  The use of such restraining devices often results in the\n31\n20272S0C.03\n\nfurther deterioration of the already fragile mental conditions of  Class members.  An\ninmate in administrative segregation at East Jersey State Prison, for example, had a\nhistory of self-mutilating behavior.  He was placed in a restraining chair for four hours\non April 5,  1995, after which he was returned to his administrative segregation cell.\nHe proceeded to tear out his eyeball and throw it at a corrections officer.\n68.  Defendants Fauver, Hilton and Beyer have also failed to\nadequately train corrections officers to recognize the signs of mental illness among\nprisoners in the general population as well as in disciplinary detention and admin-\nistrative segregation.  Custody staff assigned to disciplinary detention and admin-\nistrative segregation facilities do not receive any special training, despite the high\nconcentration of mentally ill prisoners in these facilities.  The failure to train cor-\nrections officers on how to respond appropriately to prisoners whose mental disorders\ncause them to engage in extremely bizarre and uncontrolled behaviors places Class\nmembers in jeopardy of physical and verbal abuse from the officers.  In addition, their\nlack of training leaves corrections officers enable to determine which prisoners are in\nurgent need of psychiatric assistance.  Consequently, Class members often do not\nreceive any mental health attention until they have suffered further psychological or\nphysical injury.\n69.  As a result of Defendants' deliberate indifference to these\ndeficiencies in mental health treatment, staffing, training and housing, as well as the\n32\n20272S04.03\n\nconditions of isolation and sensory deprivation in disciplinary detention and\nadministrative segregation facilities, Class members presently suffer unnecessary\nphysical pain, mental anguish and temporary or permanent exacerbation of their mental\ndisorders while confined in administrative segregation and disciplinary detention.\n70.  On July 2, 1995, DOC issued an advertised bid proposal to\nprivatize medical, dental, psychiatric and psychological services provided to prisoners\nincarcerated in DOC-operated facilities.  A copy of the portion of the proposal relating\nto mental health services is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  Defendant CMS submitted its\nbid on September 29, 1995, which DOC accepted.  A copy of the portion of the bid\nrelating to mental health services is attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n71.  The advertised bid proposal and CMS's bid proposal together\ncomprise the contract (\"CMS contract\") pursuant to which defendant CMS is providing\nhealth care services.  DOC agreed to pay defendant CMS approximately $62.4 million\nper year for a three-year contract\n72.  DOC's purpose in privatizing medical services was to reduce\nDOC expenditures on health care for prisoners.  In a press release issued on November\n28, 1995, by DOC, defendant Fauver and Governor Christie Whitman announced that\nthe contract with defendant CMS would result in an annual savings of $20 million.\nDefendant Fauver and Governor Whitman also announced that under die CMS contract,\n33\n2017210*.OJ\n\nDOC would reduce annual health care expenditures per prisoner from about $3,800 to\n$2,800.\n73.  The formula for determining defendant CMS's compensation is\nbased on the number of prisoners housed in state correctional facilities, regardless of\nthe amount of or cost of the medical, dental, psychological and psychiatric services\nwhich defendant CMS provides.  Thus, under the managed care CMS contract, CMS's\nprofit is increased by providing the least expensive services to DOC prisoners,\nincluding Class members.\n74.  The CMS contract obligates CMS to provide extensive services to\nClass members, including the following, which are set forth in full in Exhibits A and\nB:\n(a)  psychiatric evaluations of every prisoner housed in administrative\nsegregation and disciplinary detention within three days of their arrival\nand afterwards, every ten days;\n(b)  psychiatric evaluations of prisoners within 24 hours of the onset of\ntheir exhibiting unusual, behavior;\n(c)  psychiatric and psychological crisis care and prompt referrals of\nprisoners requiring greater care than the State correctional facilities are\nable to offer.\n34\n20272S0C.03\n\n(d)  psychiatric monitoring of prisoners receiving psychotropic\nmedication;\n(e)  psychological evaluation within 24 hours of prisoners with\ndifficulties adjusting to prison or who request psychological services;\nand\n(f)  psychological case management, including therapy and crisis care,\nfor mentally ill prisoners.\n75.  Defendant CMS subcontracted certain of the responsibilities\ndescribed in paragraph 74 to CBS for approximately $376,341 per month (\"the\nsubcontract\").\n76.  Defendants CMS and DOC entered into the CMS contract with\nthe intention that Class members would benefit from the services which CMS agreed to\nprovide.  Class members are also the intended beneficiaries of the CBS subcontract.\n77.  On April 27, 1996, defendant CMS began providing medical and\npsychiatric services to Class members, pursuant to the CMS contract.  The takeover of\npsychological services by defendant CMS and defendant CBS occurred on August 29,\n1996.\n78.  Since defendant CMS  assumed responsibility for prisoners'\nmedical and psychiatric care, defendant CMS has failed to perform the functions\n35\n2027250*.01\n\nrequired by the CMS contract and specifically, the functions described in paragraph 74,\nsupra.\n79.  Since defendant CBS assumed responsibility for prisoners' medical\nand psychiatric care, defendant CBS has failed to perform the functions required by the\nCMS contract, the subcontract, and specifically, the functions described in paragraph 74,\nsupra.\n80.  The privatization of mental health services has not remedied the\ngrossly inadequate mental health care which Class members receive in large part because\ndefendants CMS and CBS have continued DOC's practice of failing to provide adequate\nmental health professional staff.  At New Jersey State Prison, for example, a single\npsychiatrist is responsible for providing all psychiatric care for all mentally ill prisoners\nhoused in the prison's approximately 2000 bed facility, all while working just half the\ntime of a full-time employee.  He reported that the prison required four times the current\npsychiatric coverage to provide adequate care.\n81.  As a result of defendants CMS and CBS's failure to provide\nsufficient professional mental health staff, Class members remain incarcerated in\nadministrative segregation without access to essential mental health treatments.\nDefendants CMS and CBS are unable to even identify prisoners receiving treatment or\nthose in need of treatment, much less provide the necessary care. Consequently, grossly\n36\n20272(0*.03\n\npsychotic and dysfunctional Class members have been all but abandoned by the skeleton\nstaff of mental health professionals now employed by defendants CMS and CBS.\n82.  Despite the obvious failure of defendants CMS and CBS to\nperform the mental health services required under their respective agreements,\ndefendants Fauver, Hilton, Beyer, Forker and Farrell have failed to take the necessary\nmeasures to enforce these agreements to ensure that Class members receive the services\npromised by the advertised bid proposal and CMS's proposal as well as those services\nthat are constitutionally required.\nDefendants' Awareness and Deliberate Indifference to the Inadequacies in DOC's\nDisciplinary Process and Mental Health Care With Regard to Prisoners\nWith Serious\n83.  The DOC defendants are aware that Class members' mental\ndisorders are exacerbated by placing them in administrative segregation and disciplinary\ndetention.  Despite this knowledge, the DOC defendants and State employees under\ntheir supervision continue to place such prisoners in those facilities, sometimes for\nyears at a time.\n84.  DOC defendants are also aware that DOC's disciplinary process\nfails to take account either of the role a prisoner's mental disorder plays in a given\ninfraction or whether the prisoner is competent to understand the infraction charged.  In\nAugust 1993, a prisoner at New Jersey State Prison filed a Petition for Rulemaking\npursuant to N.J.A.C. 10A: 1-1.2.  The Petition sought an amendment to the rules\n37\n20372S0C.01\n\ngoverning prisoner discipline.  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-9.15.  The proposed amendment\nprovided that where an prisoner is charged with a disciplinary infraction while under\nthe care of a psychologist or psychiatrist or the prisoner has been placed in an\nobservation cell as a result of alleged misconduct, the treating physician must report to\nthe hearing officer as to: (1) the prisoner's competency, i.e., whether the prisoner's\ncurrent mental status precludes participation in the disciplinary process; (2) whether the\nprisoner's mental status contributed to the alleged disciplinary offense; and (3) whether\nthe prisoner's mental disorder contraindicates any particular form of punishment.\n85.  Defendant Fauver, following consultation with defendants Hilton,\nBeyer, O'Neill, rejected the Petition in its entirety on October 18, 1993.\n86.  The Public Advocate, on numerous occasions during 1993 and\n1994, brought to the attention of defendants Fauver and Beyer DOC's failures with\nregard to the provision of adequate mental health care for prisoners in New Jersey's\nstate prisons.\n87.  In 1994, the Public Advocate, through the Office of Inmate\nAdvocacy and the Division of Mental Health Advocacy, informed defendants Fauver,\nHilton and Beyer of the special problems of mentally ill prisoners in administrative\nsegregation.  In a report dated April 5, 1994, which is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, the\nPublic Advocate asserted that approximately one-third of the prisoners housed in\nadministrative segregation units were mentally ill, in need of psychiatric treatment, and\n38\n20272S04.03\n\nhad been punished and placed in isolation for displaying symptoms of their illness.  The\nreport also noted that DOC had failed to train corrections officers to recognize the signs\nof mental illness and to respond to those needs.\n88.  Defendants Fauver, Hilton and Beyer received the report\ndescribed in paragraph 87, supra..  Defendants failed to correct any of the reported\ninadequacies concerning the punishment and treatment of mentally ill prisoners\nconfined in administrative segregation.\n89.  On April 5, 1994, Susan Remis Silver, the director of the Office\nof Inmate Advocacy, informed defendant Beyer by letter:\n\"Unfortunately, neglect of the mentally-ill inmates in the ACSU\n[Administrative Close Segregation Unit] has continued to be a serious\nproblem without any improvement in the conditions.  Our investigation\nhas revealed that, in many cases, inmates are not being screened to\ndetermine a need for hospitalization.  Nor are inmates provided with\neven minimal mental health care.  Since only a few hospital beds exist in\nthe Forensic Psychiatric Hospital for the entire population of mentally ill\ninmates in ACSU (as well as other prisons) the prison psychiatrists are\nnot hospitalizing even severely ill patients.  The result of this has been\ninmate injury and death.\"\nA copy of the letter, which is annexed hereto as Exhibit D, was forwarded to defendant\nFauver.\n90.  In a subsequent meeting on May 24, 1994, between Ms. Silver\nand defendant Beyer, defendant Beyer acknowledged the existence of many of the\nproblems outlined in Ms. Silver's letter of April 5, 1994.  Nevertheless defendants\n39\n20273S0C.03\n\nhave never implemented any of the proposals relating to the punishment and treatment\nof mentally ill prisoners set forth in Exhibits C and D to this Complaint.\n91.  On July 1, 1994, the New Jersey state legislature abolished the\nPublic Advocate's office,  including the Office of Inmate Advocacy and the Division of\nMental Health Advocacy.  There is currently an Inmate Advocacy Unit in the Office of\nthe Public Defender.  However, its attorney is not permitted to bring litigation\nconcerning the punishment and treatment of mentally ill prisoners.  £& N.J.S.A.\n2A:158A-7(n); N.J.S.A. 52:27E-50 ej_seg.\n92.  Defendants, with the exception of defendant O'Neill, are aware\nthat Class members are not receiving appropriate mental health services.  Defendants,\nwith the exception of defendant O'Neill, are aware that Class members suffer\nunnecessarily from the untreated or poorly treated symptoms of their mental illnesses.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nI.\nCruel and Unusual Punishment in Violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution\n93.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 92 above as if\nthe same had been set forth herein.\n94.

Class members have no adequate remedy at law to redress the\nwrongs set forth in this Complaint.

ADDENDUM TO THE\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n)\nJACK TERHUNE, et al.\n)\nDefendants.\nWHEREAS, Plaintiff Class Members C.F., D.M., L.K., A.O. and\nJ.W., individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,\nfiled a class action suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983 on April 11,\n1996 against Defendants Commissioner of the New Jersey Department\nof  Corrections  Jack Terhune, Chief of Staff Mary Ellen Bolton,\nAssistant Commissioner Howard L. Beyer, Chief Disciplinary Hearing\nOfficer Eugene F. O'Neill, Health Services Unit Supervisor Thomas\nFarrell and Director of Psychological Services Dr. Richard Cevasco,\nin their official capacity, seeking wide-ranging injunctive relief\n\no  o\non  behalf  of  a  class  of  mentally  ill  inmates;  and  an  Amended\nComplaint was filed on July 16, 1997; and\nWHEREAS,  on May  13, 1999, the plaintiff  class  and  the  DOC\ndefendants  entered  into  a  comprehensive  settlement  agreement\nresolving all aspects of the litigation; and a fairness hearing was\nheld before  the Honorable  John J.  Hughes, U.S.M.J.,  on July  6,\n1999;  and  the  Court  approved  the  settlement  agreement  by  Order\ndated July 30, 1999; and\nWHEREAS, Section IX(1) of the Settlement Agreement provides\nthat\nThe  terms  and  conditions  reflected  in  this\nSettlement  Agreement  shall  not  be  amended,\nchanged  or  altered  orally.  Such  terms  and\nconditions may be amended, changed or altered\nonly by written agreement between the parties\nthrough their respective counsel.; and\nWHEREAS,  the parties  have  negotiated  this Addendum  to  the\nSettlement Agreement as a result of the Plaintiffs1 concerns about\nthe length of time it is taking Defendants to achieve substantial\ncompliance in all categories;\nThrough this Addendum, the parties now desire to amend certain\nterms of the Settlement Agreement\", in writing, in the  following\nmanner:\n1.  The parties' monitor, Dr. Raymond Patterson, shall expand\nhis monitoring role under Section IV of the Settlement Agreement,\nto  include  a  consulting  role.  In  his  consulting  role,  Dr.\nPatterson  shall, provide  input  to the parties  to assist  the  DOC\ndefendants in achieving substantial compliance with all terms of\nthe  Settlement  Agreement.  This  shall be accomplished  by  inter\n- 2 -\n\no  n\nalia   having meetings with Plaintiffs' counsel, defendants and the\nf\nmedical/mental health services provider to discuss the Settlement\nAgreement criteria and mechanisms for meeting those criteria, and\ndiscussion with internal quality improvement evaluators from the\nDOC and the medical/mental health services provider to demonstrate\nsubstantial compliance with criteria over time.\n2.  The DOC Defendants shall develop an Action Plan which Dr.\nPatterson shall review and critique as part of his consulting role.\nThe action plan shall:(a) have measurable goals; (b) analyze the\nobstacles to achieving those goals; (c) set forth dates certain for\novercoming  those obstacles; and  (d) set forth a methodology for\nproducing data for measuring Defendants• progress in achieving the\nAction  Plan.  The parties  agree  that  the Action  Plan will  be\nimplemented in stages in accordance with the priorities suggested\nby Dr. Patterson and that the dates set forth in the Plan shall\nreflect these stages.\n3.  The process of monitoring of the DOC facilities shall be\namended as follows:\n(A)  An additional 3 monitors (\"Assistant Monitors\") shall be\nhired,  at  the expense  of  the DOC, to  assist  Dr. Patterson  in\nmonitoring the DOC facilities.  The Assistant Monitors shall be\nrecommended by Dr. Patterson and approved by Plaintiffs' counsel\nand the DOC defendants.  In the event that any Assistant Monitor is\nunable to continue the monitoring function, a new Assistant Monitor\nwill recommended by Dr. Patterson and approved by counsel for the\nplaintiffs and the DOC.\n- 3 -\n\ni)\n(B)-  Unless-otherwise  jointly agreed  to by the parties,  the\nmonitors  will  go  to  the  same  facilities  on  each  visit.  The\ndecision as to which monitors will be assigned to which  facilities\nwill be made by Dr. Patterson, with input from Plaintiffs' counsel\nand the DOC defendants.\n(C)  In accordance with the terms and priorities of the Action\nPlan,  each  facility  shall  be  inspected  for  every  applicable\ncriteria  in  every  applicable  category  during  each  inspection,\nbeginning with the next inspection in August 2001.  As a facility\nreaches  12  months  of  continuous  substantial  compliance  in  a\nparticular  category,  the  monitor  will  cease  to  inspect  that\nfacility regarding that category as long as the facility  submits\ndocumentation  to show it remains in substantial compliance.  Drz\nPatterson shall determine the types of documentation necessary to\ndemonstrate substantial compliance.  In the event of a compelling\nhardship on the Defendants, upon consultation with Dr. Patterson,\nthe parties may, prior to the compliance period, negotiate  those\ncriteria for which substantial compliance is demonstrated  through\nvisits rather than the*\" production of documentation.\n(D)  A  facility  shall  be  deemed  to  be  non-compliant  if  it\nfails to produce the required documentation, or the documentation\nthat a facility produces indicates that it has become non-compliant\nin a category in which it was previously substantially  compliant\nunless  Defendants  cure  this  non-compliance  pursuant  to  the\nprovisions of Section IV  (J) of the Settlement Agreement.  If the\nnon-compliance  is  not  cured,  the  facility  must  start  over  its\n- 4 -\n\nO  ;)\nefforts to achieve 12 months of continuous substantial compliance\nin  that  particular  category.  Once  all  facilities  to  which  a\ncategory applies have reached 12 months of continuous substantial\ncompliance  in  a  particular  category,  the  category  will\nautomatically sunset and no additional reporting or inspecting will\nbe required regarding that category.\n(E)  Henceforth, each DOC facility shall be inspected during\neach  inspection,  unless  that  facility  has  achieved  substantial\ncompliance  or provides  services  solely  in categories  that  have\nsunset.  It is anticipated that the need to inspect all facilities\nfor all categories will decrease over time.  As the need for such\ninspections  in  every  category  at  each  facility  decreases, Dr~j\nPatterson will likewise limit the number of Assistant Monitors he\nrequires  accordingly.  Once  an  Assistant  Monitor's  assigned\nfacilities reach 12 months of continuous substantial compliance, it\nwill no longer be necessary for this Assistant Monitor to return to\nNew Jersey.\n4.  The monitor's written report  shall be prepared by Dr.\nPatterson with input from the Assistant Monitors.  The report shall\nbe  organized  according  to  the  categories  set  forth  in  Section\nIV(G)(1) of the Settlement Agreement and shall contain a report as\nto the compliance level of each facility within each criteria in\neach category.  The report shall contain the information set forth\nin Section IV(G)(2) of the Settlement Agreement as to each facility\nwithin each criteria in each category.\n- 5 -\n\nO\n5.  Section IV(F) of the Settlement is amended to permit any\nparty to write to Dr. Patterson as long as all other parties and\nthe medical and mental health provider(s) are copied.  This same\nsection is further amended to permit regular conference calls among\nDr.  Patterson,  the  parties,  and  others  as  agreed  upon  by  the\nparties.\n6.  Section  IV  (Q) (6) (q) (iii) which states  \"the facts set\nforth in the Quality Assurance reports cannot form the basis of the\nmonitor's, opinion\" shall be deleted.\nDebevoise & Plimpton Seton Hall University\nSchool of Law\nCenter for Social Justice\nldra Cobden, Esquire Patricia Perlmutter, Esq.\nAttorney for Plaintiffs Attorney for Plaintiffs\nDATED: £/ 7 CO{\nDATED: (o\nJOHN J.
