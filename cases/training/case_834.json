    "summary": "<p>On 11/15/1977, prisoners of the Penitentiary of New Mexico, represented by the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a Section 1983 class action suit in the District of New Mexico against the Governor of New Mexico and officials of the New Mexico Department of Corrections. In the first amended complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that \"the totality of the overcrowding and other conditions at PNM fall beneath standards of human decency, inflict needless suffering on prisoners and create an environment which threatens prisoners' mental and physical well-being, and results in the physical and mental deterioration and debilitation of the persons confined therein which is both unnecessary and penologically unjustifiable.\" The case was assigned to Judge Juan G. Burciaga.</p><p>In 1979, the parties reached a settlement agreement–sometimes known as the Duran Consent Decree–which was adopted by the court. The <a href=\"http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/prison-lawsuit-plaintiff-dwight-duran-dies-at/article_00c80ec4-ef0c-5df5-bc18-018611caa758.html\">original plaintiff</a> was released and began a life as an advocate for prisoners. In February 1980, 12 days after the plaintiff was released, a massive prison riot broke out and the decree was modified. The modified decree focused on fourteen issues: correspondence, attorney visitation, food services, legal access, visitation, classification, living conditions, activity, medical care, mental health care, staffing and training, administrative segregation, discipline, and pre-hearing detention/disciplinary segregation. As part of the decree a special master was required to file a report every six months evaluating defendants' compliance.</p><p>There was periodic litigation throughout the 1980s regarding the implementation of the consent order. In 1986, the plaintiffs successfully sought a preliminary injunction to halt prison staff layoffs with respect to medical care, mental health care and security. Duran v. Anaya, 642 F. Supp. 510 (D.N.M. 1986).  </p><p>In 1988, prison officials moved to vacate portions of the consent decree. Judge Burciaga denied the motion to vacate, holding that by presenting to the court an agreed remedial order, state officials waived their their ability to object to the full scope of equitable remedies. Duran v. Carruthers, 678 F. Supp. 839 (D.N.M. 1988). The defendants appealed. The Tenth Circuit (Judge McWilliams) affirmed the lower court decision, holding that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the consent decree, even if some of the relief could not have been granted by the court under the Eleventh Amendment had the case gone to trial. Duran v. Carruthers, 885 F.2d 1485 (10th Cir. 1989).  </p><p>Following renewed litigation, the parties agreed to a new settlement agreement in June 1991. The settlement agreement established new restrictions on overcrowding and modified provisions of the existing injunctive decree. The settlement agreement also established a timetable for monitoring and reporting by a special master. The monitoring process continued through the mid-1990's with Vincent M. Nathan and W. David Arnold acting as special masters.  </p><p>In December 1994, the plaintiffs sought contempt sanctions and further remedial orders; the parties settled the enforcement dispute in March 1995, with additional stipulated relief. But in January 1996, New Mexico began to move prisoners to Texas. The plaintiffs argued that this violated the prior agreements, and the court granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the transfer. In March of that year, the parties agreed that the transfer of 350 medium security prisoners could go forward if the Texas facilities satisfied certain minimal standards, set out in the stipulation. The parties amended the agreement in August 1997. </p><p>During late 1996 or early 1997, Governor Gary Johnson vetoed a bill that would have set up a commission to oversee prison releases to deal with overcrowding at state prisons. At that point, the plaintiffs sought a population cap for the New Mexico Penitentiary, and Chief Judge Conway agreed to convene a three-judge district court to consider the request, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (which limits such orders to narrow circumstances and requires they be considered by a specially convened three-judge panel). The panel met in March 1997 and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for September 1997. With that as the deadline, the parties reached an interim settlement, designed to reduce population by measures including increased use of diversion by drug courts and allowing prisoners to regain lost good time under certain circumstances. The agreement was filed in August 1997; it put off any additional hearing on overcrowding for a few months. It seems that even though the agreement included population caps, the state agreed not to challenge them until April 1998.  </p><p>Later in 1997, the parties agreed to a termination plan that provided \"definitive, specific, and measurable tasks to be accomplished in order to achieve substantial compliance.\" The termination plan required the administration of check out audits by a special monitor and self-monitoring in all areas except for medical care. The termination plan also established December 1998 as a deadline for substantial compliance with the agreement. Following a finding of substantial compliance all orders were to be vacated.  </p><p>The docket for this case only contains two entries from 1998 and 1999 regarding objections by defendants to a final report on mental health.</p><p>On December 9, 2015, a prisoner not listed in the original action filed a motion for an emergency injunction, contempt, and a request for counsel. The case was then reassigned to District Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales and Magistrate Judge Gregory B. Wormuth as the trial and pretrial judges. A few days later the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa. On February 19, 2016, Judge Khalsa denied the plaintiff's motion for counsel and mailed a copy of the court's \"Guide for Pro Se Litigants.\" Three days later the motion was refiled by the original class action plaintiffs. </p><p>The parties had settlement conferences before Chief Magistrate Judge Karen B. Molzen on May 27, 2016, and August 5, 2016, to resolve the issues raised in the plaintiffs' motion for emergency relief. At the second conference, they reached an agreement, and on August 31, 2016, the court granted the parties’ joint motion for approval of settlement agreement. The defendants agreed that any time they needed to put two occupants in a single cell, they would notify the court and plaintiffs' counsel 10 days prior. They agreed to meet and confer in order to take good faith efforts to avoid \"double-celling\" prisoners. The defendants also agreed to review and restore the good-time credits (credits prisoners receive for good behavior) prisoners lost for actions committed as a result of being doubled up in a single cell; the plaintiffs' counsel would review these determinations. The court retained jurisdiction over the interpretation and enforcement of this settlement agreement.</p><p>On October 31, 2016, another prisoner filed a motion for emergency relief and a motion to appoint counsel. On December 7, 2016, the court denied both motions. That same month, two plaintiffs filed separate motions for enforcement of the consent decree, and on January 4, 2017, the court again denied both of these motions.</p><p>On January 20, 2017, the plaintiffs moved for the court to enforce the settlement agreement reached between the parties specifically regarding defendants’ payment of attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses related to counsel’s work on the 2016 motion for emergency relief. The plaintiffs asked for $29,838.01 in attorneys’ fees. On March 17, 2017, Judge Gonzales granted in part and denied in part this motion. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees but noted that the amount requested was not reasonable.</p><p>On July 5, 2017, the plaintiffs moved for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking an order from the court declaring that the defendants had violated the settlement agreement and enjoining them to comply with the agreement. In May 2018, the plaintiffs brought two additional motions for declaratory, injunctive, and remedial relief. </p><p>While these motions were pending, the parties engaged in settlement negotiations throughout 2018 and into 2019. The parties filed a joint motion to approve an amended settlement agreement on August 21, 2020. The settlement set new occupancy limits, required renewed efforts to reduce understaffing, and awarded good time relief. Many class members filed objections to the proposed amended agreement, which they claimed relaxed occupancy targets that were in place under the prior settlement and provided inadequate relief, and also filed motions to stay and terminate the fairness hearings. The hearings continued despite these objections, and the court issued a final approval of the amended agreement on February 14, 2020. The revised settlement would terminate after the defendants established they were in substantial compliance with its terms for six months. In light of the new agreement, the order also denied as moot the pending motions for declaratory judgment and miscellaneous relief.  </p><p>Many class members responded to the approval of the amended settlement agreement with objections. On March 6 and 11, 2020, two class members filed appeals in response to motion to approve the settlement. As of April 10, 2020, the case is ongoing. </p>",

No. CIV-77-0721-JB\nBRUCE KING, et al.,\nDefendants.\nFIRST STIPULATION ON INMATE ACTIVITY\nThe Thirty-fourth Report of the Special Master—Report on\nInmate  Activity  at  the  Penitentiary  of  New  Mexico  (\"34th\nReport\")  reflected  continuing  shortcomings  in  Defendants'\ncompliance with the inmate activity provisions of the Modified\nDecree.  In  its November  30, 1993  order  confirming  the  3 4th\nReport,  the  Court  reiterated  its  concern  about  those\nshortcomings  and, its  insistence  that  Defendants  immediately\ndevelop mechanisms that will lead to prompt compliance.\nThe parties, their counsel, and the Special Master met on\nNovember  29  and  30, 1993, and  again  on  January  6,  1994, to\ndiscuss inmate activity issues.  Those discussions focussed on\nthe  current  status  of  Defendants'  actions  in  this  area,\nDefendants'  plans  for  further  action,  and  the  remedies  that\nPlaintiffs  might  seek  under  the  present  circumstances.  The\nresult  of these meetings  is an agreement between  the  parties\nthat is set forth in this stipulation.\nAccordingly, the parties hereby stipulate to the following:\n\nNo later than April l, 1994, the parties jointly will\ndevelop an inmate activity plan  (\"Plan\") to permit\nDefendants  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  inmate\nactivity provisions of the Modified Decree.\nNo  later  than  April  l,  1994,  the  parties  will\nnegotiate  and  file  a  stipulation  (the  \"Second\nStipulation  on  Inmate  Activity\")  for  the\nimplementation of the jointly-drafted Plan, and for\ncompliance with the Modified Decree.\nThe Second Stipulation on Inmate Activity will address\nthe  following  areas  and  contain  the  following\nprovisions:\na.  Beginning no later than May 1, 1994 all inmates\nnewly assigned to the Penitentiary of New Mexico\nwill be given the opportunity to be assessed by\nappropriate staff, using appropriate instruments,\ntechniques, a review of existing RDC data and the\ninmates'  interest,  to  determine  their\neducational,  vocational  education  and  work-\nrelated needs, interests and goals in connection\nwith the development and implementation of the\nInmate Activity Plan as outlined below:\ni.  All  inmates  newly  assigned  to  the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico will have been\ngiven the opportunity to take the WRAT and\nTABE at RDC.\n-2-\n\nii.  Newly  assigned  inmates  will  be  given  a\npresentation  concerning  educational,\nvocational  educational  and  work  offerings\nand processes during the intake orientation\nat PNM.\niii. All ILP eligible inmates will be interviewed\nand given interest surveys; the educational\nfile will be reviewed.  Further testing will\nbe  conducted  if  there  is  a  referral  or\nfunctional need demonstrated.\niv.  Non-ILP inmates who express an interest in\neducational programming will be interviewed\nand given interest surveys; the educational\nfile will be reviewed.  Further testing will\nbe  conducted  if  there  is  a  referral  or\nfunctional need demonstrated.\nv.  Inmates will not be required to participate\nin ILP if they are exempt due to a medical,\ndevelopmental  or  learning  disability  as\ndetermined pursuant to Correction Department\npolicies CD-102000 and 102001 and Sec. 33-\n11-1 et seq. NMSA.\nb.  In addition, by September 15, 1994, a sample of\nthe current population  necessary  to  promulgate\nthe filed inmate activity plan will be assessed\n-3-\n\nusing the same model as that for newly assigned\ninmates.\nc.  time lines for compliance with each paragraph of\nthe  Modified  Decree  (Inmate  Activity),  and\nstandards for the measurement of compliance, will\nbe  established;  compliance  will  be  audited\nquarterly  and will be determined  based on the\npercentage of prisoners who are engaged in inmate\nactivity as required by the policy statement on\ninmate  activity  of  the  Modified  Decree;  the\nSecond  Stipulation  will  establish  target\npercentages for each calendar quarter by facility\nbeginning with the quarter ending June 30, 1994;\nd.  in auditing compliance the Special Master will\nconsider the extent to which programs and work\nassignments are meaningful  as required  by the\ninmate activity policy statement of the modified\ndecree;\ne.  Defendants  will  warrant  that  they  have  the\nfinancial resources available to accomplish the\nPlan and to meet the time lines and compliance\nguidelines of the Stipulation; if defendants are\nunable to do so, the parties are free to pursue\nsuch legal remedies as they deem appropriate;\nf.  compliance with the Plan will be achieved without\nany substantial deprivation of existing rights to\n-4-\n\nwhich members of plaintiffs class are entitled\nunder the modified decree at the PNM complex;\ninmates who are assigned to the Inmate Literacy\nProgram  (\"ILP\")  in  conjunction  with\nimplementation of the Plan will not be required\nto relinquish their job assignments as a result\nof assignment to the ILP, but instead will be\nassigned to an ILP class during non-working hours\nwith the following exceptions:\ni.  Any inmate who has been assigned to a job\nfor less than 6 months,\nii.  Any inmate who has voluntarily left a job\nassignment-\niii. Any  inmate  who  has  been  removed  for\nmisconduct  or  failure  to  perform  a  job\nsatisfactorily.\niv.  Any inmate who has been transferred from one\nfacility to another so long as the transfer\nis not for the purposes of placement in ILP.\nv.  Any  inmate  who  has  been  placed  in\ndisciplinary segregation.\nAn inmate previously removed from work assignment\nfor placement in ILP will be given an opportunity\nto be reinstated in such work positions or a job\nwith comparable pay as well as an opportunity to\ncomplete ILP requirements at a time that does not\n-5-\n\ninterfere with the work assignment subject to the\nabove listed exceptions;\nh.  Defendants1  failure  to  meet  any  of  their\nobligations  under  the  Second  Stipulation  on\nInmate  Activity  will  not  be  construed\nautomatically  as  evidence  of  contempt  of  the\nModified Decree;\ni.  the Second Stipulation on Inmate Activity shall\ninclude  a provision protecting  Defendants  from\nintentional actions of members of the Plaintiff\nclass which impede or are intended to impede or\nprohibit compliance with the Stipulation;\nj.  the Second Stipulation on Inmate Activity shall\ncontain provisions concerning actions to be taken\nby  the  Special  Master  and  the  parties  in  the\nevent target percentages are not met and shall\ngive the Defendants an opportunity  to meet the\ntarget  percentages  in  a  reasonable  period  of\ntime; and\nk.  the  term  of  the  Second  Stipulation  on  Inmate\nActivity  shall  extend  until  July  1,  1995,  at\nwhich  time  Defendants  shall  be  required  to\nachieve  substantial  compliance  with  the policy\nstatement  on  Inmate  Activity  of  the  modified\ndecree.

Box  8180\nSanta Fe, NM  87504-8180\n(505) 988-8004\nAttorney for Plaintiffs\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nvs.  No. CIV-77-0721-JB\nBRUCE KING, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER\nThe Court previously addressed compliance with the Modified\nDecree  in  this  cause  at  the  New  Mexico  Women's  Correctional\nFacility  (\"NMWCF\") in the areas of inmate discipline, visiting,\nclassification,  inmate  correspondence,  access  to  Courts,  food\nservice, staffing, and living conditions (See orders of January 29,\n1992 and January 25, 1993). Compliance in the only two additional\nareas of institutional concern that remain applicable to NMWCF,\nadministrative segregation and inmate activity, have not been the\nsubject of previous Court order.\nNevertheless, the parties have now stipulated that NMWCF is in\nsubstantial compliance with the inmate activity and administrative\nsegregation provisions of the Modified Decree. Their stipulation to\nthat effect, included within their joint motion  to vacate the\nModified  Decree at NMWCF, is attached  to the Special Master's\nRecommendations Concerning Joint Motion to Vacate Modified Decree\nAs To The New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility.\nIn that document, the Special Master recommends that the Court\napprove the parties' stipulations within their joint motion that\n(1) defendants have achieved substantial compliance at NMWCF in the\n\naraas of administrative segregation and inmate activity and, (2) no\nfurther  self-monitoring  is  required  in  those  two  areas.  In\naddition, the Special Master recommends that the Court enter an\norder vacating the Modified Decree at NMWCF as provided  for in\n§III.D.ii of the Modified Decree.\nThe  Court has  carefully  reviewed  and  considered  both  the\nSpecial Master's recommendations and the parties' joint motion. The\nCourt finds that, despite the absence of a formal report by the\nSpecial Master finding that defendants have achieved substantial\ncompliance at NMWCF in the areas of administrative segregation and\ninmate activity, the parties' stipulation in their joint motion\nthat substantial compliance has been achieved, together with their\nreport of the underlying activities that permitted them to reach\nthat conclusion and the Special Master's recommendations in this\nregard,  reflect  that  substantial  compliance  with  the  Modified\nDecree has been achieved in these two areas at NMWCF. The Court\nfurther finds that, despite the absence of a specified period of\nformal self-monitoring of compliance in these two areas at NMWCF,\nthe parties' stipulation in their joint motion that informal self-\nmonitoring has confirmed that the substantial compliance that has\nbeen achieved has been maintained, together with their explanation\nof the informal self-monitoring activities that occurred and the\nSpecial Master's recommendations in this regard, reflect that no\nfurther self-monitoring requirements ought be imposed in these two\nareas at NMWCF. Finally, the Court  finds that the  substantive\nprinciples and purposes undergirding the process established in\n\n§III.D.ii of the Modified Decree have been met in connection with\nadministrative segregation and inmate activity at NMWCF.\nAccordingly, the Court being fully advised in the premises and\nfor good cause shown,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Special Masters Recommendations\nConcerning Joint Motion to Vacate Modified Decree As To The New\nMexico Women7s Correctional Facility be and hereby is accepted and\napproved.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties' stipulation within\ntheir joint motion regarding NMWCF be and hereby is approved.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Modified Decree is vacated at\nNMWCF in all respects and as to all areas, except as otherwise\nprovided in §III.D.ii of the Modified Decree.\nJUAN G.

In its November 30, 1993 order confirming the 34th\nReport,  the  Court  reiterated  its  concern  about  those\nshortcomings  and  its  insistence  that  Defendants  immediately\ndevelop mechanisms that will lead to prompt compliance.\nThe parties, their counsel, and the Special Master met on\nNovember  29 and  30, 1993, and again on January  6,  1994, to\ndiscuss inmate activity issues.  Those discussions focussed on\nthe  current  status  of  Defendants'  actions  in  this  area,\nDefendants' plans  for  further action, and the remedies that\nPlaintiffs might  seek under the present circumstances.  The\nresult of these meetings is an agreement between the parties\nthat is set forth in this stipulation.\nAccordingly, the parties hereby stipulate to the following:\n\nNo later than April 1, 1994, the parties jointly will\ndevelop an inmate activity plan  (\"Plan\") to permit\nDefendants  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  inmate\nactivity provisions of the Modified Decree.\nNo  later  than  April  l,  1994,  the  parties  will\nnegotiate  and  file  a  stipulation  (the  \"Second\nStipulation  on  Inmate  Activity\")  for  the\nimplementation of the jointly-drafted Plan, and for\ncompliance with the Modified Decree.\nThe Second Stipulation on Inmate Activity will address\nthe  following  areas  and  contain  the  following\nprovisions:\na.  Beginning no later than May 1, 1994 all inmates\nnewly assigned to the Penitentiary of New Mexico\nwill be given the opportunity to be assessed by\nappropriate staff, using appropriate instruments,\ntechniques, a review of existing RDC data and the\ninmates'  interest,  to  determine  their\neducational,  vocational  education  and  work-\nrelated needs, interests and goals in connection\nwith the development and implementation of the\nInmate Activity Plan as outlined below:\ni.

Compliance in the only two additional\nareas of institutional concern that remain applicable to NMWCF,\nadministrative segregation and inmate activity, have not been the\nsubject of previous Court order.\nNevertheless, the parties have now stipulated that NMWCF is in\nsubstantial compliance with the inmate activity and administrative\nsegregation provisions of the Court's orders in this cause. Their\nstipulation to that effect, included within their joint motion to\n\ndismiss,  is  attached  to  the  Special  Masters  Recommendations\nConcerning Joint Motion to Dismiss.\nIn that document, the Special Master recommends that the Court\napprove the parties' stipulations within their joint motion to\ndismiss that (1) defendants have achieved substantial compliance at\nNMWCF  in  the  areas  of  administrative  segregation  and  inmate\nactivity and, (2) no further self-monitoring is required in those\ntwo areas. In addition, the Special Master recommends that the\nCourt enter an order dismissing this action as provided  for in\n§III.D.ii of the Modified Decree.\nThe  Court has  carefully  reviewed  and  considered  both the\nSpecial Master's recommendations and the parties7 joint motion to\ndismiss. The Court finds that, despite the absence of a formal\nreport by the Special Master finding that defendants have achieved\nsubstantial compliance at NMWCF  in the areas of administrative\nsegregation and inmate activity, the parties' stipulation within\ntheir joint motion to dismiss that substantial compliance has been\nachieved, together with their report of the underlying activities\nthat  permitted  them  to  reach  that  conclusion  and  the  Special\nMaster's recommendations in this regard, reflect that substantial\ncompliance has been achieved in these two areas at NMWCF.

      "text": "/  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT f  I  JL  l&\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\n)\nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nvs.  Civil No. 77-0721-JC\nGARY JOHNSON, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER APPROVING AMENDED STIPULATION AND SUGGESTING\nMODIFICATION OF THREE-JUDGE COURT'S APRIL 3.1997 ORDER\nOn March 29,1996 the parties in this civil action filed, and the court entered an order\napproving, a stipulation concerning the assignment of certain New Mexico inmates to certain\nfacilities in Texas. The parties have now filed an amended stipulation to supplant the March 29,\n1996 stipulation in its entirety (the \"Amended Stipulation\").\nThe Amended Stipulation addresses a wide variety of population issues, including\ncontinued use of out of state beds in Texas and Arizona, continued use of a limited number of\nday room beds, and implementation of certain measures designed to better manage the NMCD\npopulation.  In a separate filing directed to the three-judge court empaneled in this action, the\nparties have stated that, in their opinion, the Amended Stipulation adequately addresses\npopulation management in the near term, which is to say through the 1998 legislative session.\nAccording to the parties, the combination of the continued use of out of state beds and the\n\"non-bed\" related measures included in the Amended Stipulation appears to have ameliorated on\nan interim basis the population concerns that led to the order convening the three-judge court.\nThe court has carefully reviewed the Amended Stipulation and finds that it adequately\naddresses population management issues on an interim basis. Accordingly, the court will\nDuran v. Apodaca\nPC-NM-001-043\n\napprove the Amended Stipulation, and enter it as the order of this court.\nThe court also notes that the Amended Stipulation is a comprehensive agreement between\nthe parties as to the interim use of certain out of state facilities.  As such, it addresses the\nconcerns that led to the final operative paragraph of the April 3,1997 order entered by the three-\njudge court, in which that court abrogated \"any restrictions concerning the transfer and housing\nof prisoners out-of-state\" until the merits are resolved.  Moreover, the Amended Stipulation\nprovides a comprehensive framework for the continued use of certain out of state facilities under\nterms and conditions that this court finds to be neither unreasonable nor deleterious to the interim\nresolution of the defendants' population issues. Thus, it appears that the parties have\naccomplished by agreement the overall result that the final paragraph of the April 3 order was\nintended to reach, and that the conflict between the Amended Stipulation and that paragraph\nshould be resolved by modifying or withdrawing that portion of the April 3 order. Although the\nAmended Stipulation does not finally \"resolve the merits\" it does provide a framework for\npopulation management, including continued use of certain out of state facilities, that eliminates,\nat least on an interim basis, the need to abrogate all restrictions on the out of state transfer of\ninmates.1\nAccordingly, the court will direct the cierk of court to provide a copy of this order and the\nAmended Stipulation to Circuit Judge Kelly and District Judge Black for their consideration of\nthe potential modification or withdrawal of the last paragraph of the April 3 order.\n1  The court also notes that the parties simultaneously filed a joint motion addressed\nto the three-judge court seeking to defer the trial scheduled for September 22,1997 until after the\n1998 New Mexico legislative session. The parties propose to file a joint status report within\nforty-five days of adjournment of that session. Thus, the parties have proposed a procedure\nwhereby the merits can finally be resolved, as required by the April 3 order, albeit on a somewhat\ndifferent time schedule.\n\nThe court being fully advised in the premises and for good cause shown,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that thp Amended Stipulation shall be and hereby is\napproved.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Amended Stipulation shall be and hereby is entered\nas an order of this court.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of court shall forward a copy of thic order and\nof the Amended Stipulation to Circuit Judge Kelly and to District Judge Black.\n//  dayof  UAA*,\nDATED this the  //  day of  0UA*ts«i7\\  , 1997.\n/Jo/in E.

BURCIAGA\nvs.  )\nTONEY ANAYA, et al.,  )\nDefendants.  )\n)\nSTIPULATION CONCERNING CLOSING OF\nDORMITORIES AT THE PENITENTIARY OF NEW MEXICO\nThe parties to the above-captioned civil action met on March\n5 and 6, 1984 to discuss issues raised by the first and second\nreports of the Special Master on the defendants' state of compli-\nance  with  the  Court's  orders  in  this  litigation.  Among  the\nmatters  discussed  in these meetings were  the  findings of the\nSpecial Master set forth in his second report on compliance with\nthe Court's orders relating to staffing.  As a result of those\nmeetings, and subsequent developments, the parties have reached\nagreement on certain issues relating to the secure operation of\nthe Penitentiary of New Mexico in compliance with the orders of\nthe Court, and they hereby enter into the following stipulation.\n1.  The Special Master found, in his Second Report on the\nDefendants'  State  of Compliance  (Staffing),  that  \"although  at\nleast one correctional officer is scheduled to be stationed in\nthe sally port adjoining each dormitory at the Penitentiary of\nNew Mexico at all times, these officers are not deployed in such\na  manner  as  to  assure  visual  observation  of  inmates  at  all\n\ntimes.\"  Neither  party  to  this  litigation  objected  to  that\nfinding and it has been confirmed by the Court.\n2.  It is not possible to deploy correctional officers in\nthe  dormitory  housing  units  at  PNM  in  a  manner  that  assures\nvisual observation of inmates at all times.  Any such deployment\nis contrary to sound correctional practice.\n3.  In  the  absence  of  continuous  visual  observation  of\ninmates assigned to dormitory housing units at PNM, those dormi-\ntories cannot be operated in a manner that provides to inmates\nassigned to them a reasonable degree of safety.  Utilization of\nthe dormitory housing units at PNM for housing inmates under such\ncircumstances creates an unjustifiable risk of harm to inmates\nand  therefore  is  contrary  to  sound  correctional  policy  and\nviolates the Court's order in this cause.\n4.  The present  inmate population  in New Mexico  and the\ncapacity of available medium and maximum security facilities for\nadult  inmates  requires  the  continued  short-term  use . of  the\ndormitories  at  PNM  to house  inmates.  This  necessity  will be\neliminated  by  the  completion  of  construction  of  additional\ncorrectional facilities at Santa Fe.\n5.  Upon the opening of the Penitentiary of New Mexico  —\nNorth  Facility, all  inmates  housed  at  that  time  in  dormitory\nhousing units  at PNM will be reassigned  to general population\nhousing.  The reassignment and relocation of inmates from dormi-\ntories at PNM will be accomplished as quickly as possible and in\n\nno event shall it take more than thirty working days after the North\nfacility is open for occupancy.\n6.  After all inmates have been reassigned from dormitory housing\nunits at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, those dormitories shall be closed\npermanently and at no time in the future shall they be used to house inmates.\n7.  The parties enter into this stipulation in full awareness of existing\nprojections of increases in the New Mexico inmate population in the future\nand of the fact that these projections may be exceeded.\nSigned:\nMichael Francke JohTrBigeTow\nSecretary\nCounsel for Defendants\nWilliam W.

We have informally indicated to you\nthat we do not agree with these proposed changes, and this\nletter will serve as formal notice of our disagreement.  In our\nopinion, altering the Decree in such a way that someone can be\nlocked up in maximum security for up to two years for possession\nof a weapon is such a departure from the disciplinary and\nmaximum security scheme that it would work so as to lessen the\nbenefits to the Plaintiffs class.\ni\nYours very truly,\n r\nWilliam W.

      "text": "FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO u uN   1 9  ^\nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.,\nENTERED ON DOCKET\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civil No. 77-0721-JB\nBRUCE KING, etal., Duran v. Apodaca\nDefendants.\n^-NM-001-025\nORDER\nON  June  10, 1991, the parties  filed  a Settlement  Agreement  in this  cause.  The\nAgreement  establishes  certain  restrictions  on  overcrowding  of  inmates  throughout the\ncorrectional  institutions  that are the subject  of this  litigation,  modifies  various  substantive\nprovisions of existing injunctive decrees, and establishes a timetable for monitoring and reporting\nby the Special Master.  The Settlement Agreement also provides for dismissal of all pending\nmotions of either party.  Upon findings of substantial compliance and a period of self-monitoring\nand  self-reporting  by Defendants,  the Agreement  provides  for the ultimate vacation  of all\ninjunctive decrees except for certain portions of the Settlement Agreement itself which will be\nin effect  permanently.\nThe Court's  order of August 8, 1990, required the parties to attempt to resolve the\noutstanding  contempt  motion  filed by Plaintiffs  and to attempt to reach  agreement  on any\nmodifications to extant remedial orders Defendants might wish to seek.  The order of August 8,\n1990,  also required  the parties to develop and present to the Court a comprehensive plan for\ntermination of the mastership and of the Court's active supervision of its remedial orders.\n17 os-\n\nThe Court has reviewed the proposed Settlement Agreement and is pleased to note that\nit accomplishes all of the objectives set forth in the order of August 8, 1990.  The terms of the\nSettlement Agreement,  and the exhibits incorporated  therein,  are fair and reasonable and its\nimplementation will benefit the members of the Plaintiff Class.  Since the Settlement Agreement\nconstitutes a compromise of this class action, however, pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, members of the Plaintiff Class are entitled to notice and an opportunity\nto object prior to any final approval of the Agreement.  Therefore, the Court will provisionally\napprove the Settlement Agreement at this time, subject to notice to the members of the Plaintiff\nClass in accordance with this order.1\nNo later  than  June 28,  1991, the parties  shall file a proposed joint  form  of  notice,\nsummarizing  the  salient  features  of  the Settlement Agreement  and  the exhibits  incorporated\ntherein.  Once approved by the Court, the notice shall be distributed to members of the class in\naccordance with the terms of an order that will be entered at that time, and a date for a hearing\nto consider any objections will be scheduled.\nAll reasonable steps shall be taken by Plaintiffs' counsel to assist inmates to understand\nthe provisions of the Settlement Agreement.  Although the joint form of notice is expected to\nbe sufficient to apprise many inmates of the essential terms of the compromise, some confusion\nand misunderstandings may result.  After the distribution of the approved joint form of notice,\ntherefore, the parties shall submit to the Court a statement setting out the procedures to be taken\n1 In this connection, the Court notes that references are made throughout the Settlement Agreement to the \"Effective\nDate\" of the Agreement.  In order to avoid misunderstanding, the Court announces that the date of the instant order,\nprovisionally approving the Agreement, should not be regarded as the effective date of the parties' agreement; that the\neffective date is dependent upon the Court's final approval of the Agreement.  Nonetheless, in view of the Court's\nprovisional approval of the Settlement Agreement, the Special Master is to commence monitoring and reporting, pursuant\nto the terms of that Agreement, as of the date of this order.\n\nby Plaintiffs' counsel to inform members of the class of the terms of the Settlement Agreement,\nto the end that members of the class be educated as thoroughly as possible about the content and\nthe ramifications of the Settlement Agreement.\nUnderstanding that the security of any institution may not be compromised,  the Court\nexpects Defendants to permit all reasonable actions necessary to educate members of the class\nduring the period allowed for submission of objections.  Simultaneously with the proposed joint\nform  of notice, the parties shall submit a joint statement  setting forth  the manner in  which\nPlaintiffs' counsel and their inmate committee representatives will be granted access to members\nof the class for the purposes outlined in this order.\nWherefore,\nIT IS SO ORDERED at Albuquerque this 18th day of June, 1991.\nJUAN G.

      "text": "at Santa Fe. NM\nMAR  21995\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OP NEW MEXICO\nDWIGHT DURAN, ©t al..\nPlaintiffs,\nvs. CIVIL NO. 77-072l-JB\nGARY JOHNSON, et al.,\nDefendants.\nSTIPULATION AS TO PENITENTIARY OF NEW MEXICO\nI.  GENERAL PROVISIONS\nA.  For the purpose of this Stipulation, the parties agree\nthat, as used herein and as used in Section III.D.ii of the June\n10,  1991  Settlement  Agreement,  the  terms  \"facility11  and\n\"facilities\" mean the Penitentiary of New Mexico's Main, North\nand South Units, separately and individually. As is contemplated\nby Section III.D.ii of the June 10, 1991 Settlement Agreement,\nthe  special  master  will  conduct  periodic  audits  at  the\nfacilities.  These audits will focus, separately or collectively\ndepending on the topic, on all substantive areas of the order,\nother than system-wide issues, that have not been vacated from\nthe  Decree.  Collectively,  these  subjects  of  monitoring  are\nreferred to as \"Areas.\"\nB.  If following an audit the special master determines\nthat defendants have achieved substantial compliance in an Area\nat a facility, he will report to the parties and the Court.  An\n1\nDuran v. Apodaca\nPC-NM-001-037\n\nArea determined to be in substantial compliance at a facility\nwill be designated as \"awaiting self-monitoring.\"\nC.  Areas awaiting self-monitoring will be expected to\nremain  in  substantial  compliance.  The  special  master will\nconduct  no  active  monitoring  of  any  Area  awaiting  self-\nmonitoring.  Defendants will conduct informal audits of each\nArea awaiting self-monitoring, and will informally report the\nresults  of  those  audits  to  the  special  master  and  the\nplaintiffs' counsel every 90 days.  These periodic reports will\nbe based on a reporting format jointly developed in advance by\ndefendants and the special master.  Moreover plaintiffs will\ncontinue to have the right to inspect and monitor compliance in\nany facility as described in the twenty-ninth special master's\nreport.  In addition to defendants' informal reports, if other\nsignificant  evidence comes to the  attention  of the special\nmaster indicating that an Area awaiting self-monitoring may no\nlonger be in substantial compliance, the special master will\nconduct whatever monitoring he deems appropriate and report the\nfindings of that monitoring to the parties.  If the special\nmaster determines, based on an informal report by defendants or\non his own monitoring, that an Area awaiting self-monitor ing is\nno longer in substantial compliance, he will informally bring\nthat  determination,  along  with  the  evidence  supporting  his\nfindings, to the attention of the parties.  If the matter is not\nresolved informally by the parties, he will file a report that\ncontains his findings, the evidence supporting his findings, and\n\na recommendation that the Area be returned to active monitoring\nstatus.\nD.  When  all  Areas  at  a  facility  are  awaiting  self-\nmonitoring, the special master will issue a report noting that\ndevelopment and requesting from each party the suggested scope\nfor a final audit of that  facility.  The special master will\ndetermine the scope of the final audit, taking into account the\nlength of time each Area has been in awaiting  self-monitoring\nstatus;  allegations  of  non-compliance;  and  the  findings  of\ndefendants' informal audits.  Following  the  final  audit,  the\nspecial master will recommend  a period of self-monitoring  for\nthat facility as required by Section. III.D.ii of the June 10,\n1991 Settlement Agreement, which in no event will be longer than\nthe time period established by that Section.  In establishing\nthe period  for self-monitoring,  the special master will  take\ninto  account  the  scope  and  results  of  the  final  audit,  the\nlength of time Areas  at that  facility have been  in  awaiting\nself-monitoring status, as well as other factors bearing on the\nlikelihood of continued substantial compliance.\nII.  PNM-MAIN\nA.  Monitoring\nThe PNM-Main facility was built in 1956.  Previous reports\nof the special master have documented numerous violations of the\nCourt's Order on Living Conditions.  Defendants now propose to\nreplace  PNM-Main  and,  therefore,  believe  that  only  interim\n\nrepairs to PNM-Main are appropriate.  Plaintiffs maintain that\nunless and until a permanent replacement  facility exists, the\ninstitution must be repaired to meet all standards set forth in\nthe Court's  Order on  Living  Conditions.  In the  interest  of\nresolving  this issue without the necessity of litigation, the\nparties have agreed to §11 of this stipulation.\nThe special master will continue to monitor Areas at PNM-\nMain on the auditing schedules established with the parties.  In\naddition,  unless  otherwise  provided,  the  living  conditions\nmodifications and activities described below will be completed\nno later than October 1, 1995. In the absence of a finding by\nthe special master that the failure to meet one or more of these\nobligations affects fewer than all inmates in the facility, in\nwhich  case  the  special  master  will  recommend  the  number  of\ninmates who can continue to be assigned safely to PNM-Main, no\nDuran class member may be housed in PNM-Main after November 1,\n1995 unless all of the following obligations are met.\n1.  In order to prevent the leakage of raw sewage and\nthe accumulation of sewage odors, sewer and other plumbing lines\nwill  be  improved  and  maintained  with  the  addition  of  two\njetter/blasters and the design of and installation of cleanouts\nin accordance with Exhibit 1 attached hereto.  Defendants will\nmaintain the sewage system, including the main line outside of\nthe building, through regularly scheduled preventive maintenance\nand  rootering  as  needed.  Such  preventive  maintenance  shall\ninclude:\n\na.  use  of  a  written  preventive  maintenance  manual,  a\nmaintenance schedule, and an equipment maintenance checklist\nb.  keeping on hand an adequate inventory of parts\nc.  recording  of  preventive  maintenance,  including\nconditions at time of maintenance, on a permanent log.\n2.  Within ten days following the execution of this\nstipulation,  defendants  will  submit  for  Dr.  Lambert  King's\nreview and approval the defendants' protocol for the screening\nand identification of prisoners for tuberculosis.  That protocol\nrequires prompt and appropriate testing and evaluation, as well\nas  the  prompt  transfer  of  any  prisoner  suspected  of  having\ntuberculosis to a medically appropriate hospital  facility for\nfinal diagnosis and  treatment.  Inmates  found to have  active\ninfectious tuberculosis will not be  returned  to any  facility\nwithin the New Mexico Department of Corrections until they are\nno longer infectious or unless they can be placed in a setting\nthat will prevent the spread of infection to other inmates.  Any\nrevisions in defendants' protocol will be implemented no later\nthan ten days after those revisions are finalized by Dr. King\nand defendants.\n3. No later than June 1, 1995, in order to ensure that\nextreme  temperatures  do  not  interfere  with  educational\nactivities in the classrooms, defendants will:\na.  improve ventilation and provide for sufficient intake\nof fresh air  in the class rooms by enclosing the 4 x1  vent\n\nopenings and replacing the vents with air diffusers to provide\na better controlled and balanced air supply\nb.  take  air  flow  measurements  to  determine  if  the\ninstallation of additional air diffusers is needed\nc.  install cooling units or other cooling devices adequate\nto accomplish the stated objective of this paragraph.\n4.  All  lock improvements and repairs necessary to\nmeet state building and fire codes will be completed.\n5. (a)  A manual fire alarm system will be installed\nthroughout the main building.  In general, pull stations will be\nlocated at each correctional officer's station and adjacent to\neach exit from each building except for the secondary rear exits\nfrom the cell blocks (for example, pull stations will be located\nadjacent to the  connection  of the  cellblocks to the central\ncorridor at the first floor and basement level).  Pull stations\nwill also be located adjacent to the rear exits in non-housing\nunits.\n5.  (b)  Smoke  detectors  shall  be  provided  in the\nfollowing areas:\n(i) at the ceilings in the common areas of each\ncellblock  (for example, this will include the\ncenter port of cellblocks 1, 2 and 6 and\noutside the cells in cellblocks 3, 4 and 5)\n(ii) the corridors in the basement and on the\nfirst floor\n\n6.  Smoke barriers will be provided across the main\ncorridor on the first floor to allow  for horizontal  evacuation\nof  the  occupants.  These  barriers  shall  be  provided  at  the\nfollowing  locations:\n(a) between cellblocks  3 & 6 and cellblocks 4 & 5\n(b) between cellblocks  1 & 2 and the dining\narea/administrative  areas\nThe location of the barriers are more particularly described on\nExhibit 2 attached hereto.\n7.  The HVAC  controls  in  the mechanical  rooms  will\nshut down  the HVAC Units  automatically,  sequentially  within a\ntwo minute period,  upon activation  of any device connected  to\nthe fire alarm system, including smoke detectors, heat detectors\nand  pull  stations.  This  paragraph  shall  not  apply  to  the\nadministration  area,  the  chapel,  the  first  floor area  of  the\nkitchen and the gymnasium.\n8.  A smoke-tight  enclosure of stairways  connecting\nthe main corridors in the basement and the first floor, as well\nas the stairways in the hospital and psychiatric units, will be\nprovided.\n9.  All  of  the  following  enclosures,  including  all\nopenings in the enclosures,  will be one hour fire rated: door\nat  the  rear  stairwell  of  the  basement  hospital  storage  area;\nenclosure  and door at the existing  fenced storage area of the\nconvenience  snack  bar;  two  walls  and  2 doors  to  enclose  the\nstorage area in the basement that serves the laundry and is used\n\nfor mattress, clothing and supply storage; sealing of windows in\nthe basement kitchen storage area and a door in this area.  In\naddition, heat detectors will be installed in each storage area\nand the laundry and maintenance shops in the basement and they\nwill be connected to the fire alarm system.\n10.  Defendants agree to conduct training and drilling\nof correctional officers in fire safety. Such training shall be\nconducted by staff who are specially trained for that purpose.\nDrilling shall be conducted in each housing unit, including the\ninfirmary,  at  least  three  times a  year, on  each  shift  (for\nexample, each shift will receive a drill every four months and\neach  unit  will  receive  9  drills  per  year).  Not  all  drills\nrequire the evacuation of all inmates.  Drill scenarios will be\nvaried.\n11.  Defendants will contract with a competent outside\nprovider for the regular maintenance, inspection, and repair of\nthe fire alarm and smoke detection systems, which contract will\nprovide for timely service as needed.\n12.  Defendants  will  remove  the  stored  combustible\nmaterial from the basement corridor and maintain that area as\ncombustible-free.\n13.  Defendants  will  provide  a  secondary means of\negress from the inmate dining room.  The means of egress shall\nbe  clearly  posted,  marked  and  accessible  when  the  inmates'\ndining room is occupied.\n8\n\n14.  Defendants  will  demonstrate,  by  drill,  on  or\nbefore March 1, 1995 that, during lockdowns, all locks necessary\nto release inmates from a cellblock can be accomplished by one\ncorrectional  officer  within  five  minutes.  This  may  not  be\npossible in Cellblock 6 and, if not possible, then, on or before\nJune 30, 1995, a smoke control  system  shall be provided,  for\nthat cellblock, following the criteria in Section A-15-3.1.3 and\nFigure A-15-3.1.3(a) of the NFPA Life Safety Code (1991 ed.).\n15.  Defendants'  progress  in  achieving  the  tasks\nrequired by paragraph II.A.4 through 14 above will be reviewed\nby the Court's expert on fire safety during the second quarter\nof 1995.  No later than October 1, 1995, defendants will notify\nthe special master that all of these tasks have been completed,\nand the special master thereupon will arrange for a prompt audit\nand  report  by  the  court's  expert  on  fire  safety.  Upon\ncompletion of the tasks required by paragraph II.A.4 through 14\nabove,  defendants  will  notify  plaintiffs'  counsel  and  the\nspecial master, will begin informal auditing of the maintenance\nof these improvements, and will informally report the results of\nthose audits to the special master and the plaintiffs' counsel\nevery  90  days.  In  addition,  following  completion  of  tasks\nII.A.I through 14 above or as long as Duran class members are\nhoused  at  PNM-Main,  the court's  experts on living  conditions\nwill periodically review living conditions at PNM-Main.  To the\nextent possible, the special master will schedule these reviews\nin conjunction with audits by these experts at other facilities.\n\nB.  Replacement of PNM-Main\nDefendants agree to take all steps necessary to obtain a\nreplacement facility for PNM-Main.  In accomplishing this goal,\ndefendants agree that their efforts will  include, but not be\nlimited to, the following:\n1.  Defendants will seek appropriate funding for a\nreplacement  facility  by  providing  all  necessary  feasibility\nstudies and other data to appropriate legislative committees.\nDefendants  will  meet  all  reasonable  requests  from  such\nlegislative committees in providing data and expertise necessary\nto expedite the funding process prior to the next legislative\nsession.\n2.  Defendants  will  take  all  other  reasonably\nnecessary steps to see that this funding request is considered\nand acted upon favorably during the 1995 legislative session,\nincluding, but not limited to, making this particular capital\noutlay request the first priority among all other capital outlay\nrequests submitted during the session and seeking all available\nemergency funding provisions in this capital outlay legislation.\nC.  Further Agreements\nNo  later  than  May  1,  1995, defendants  will  certify  to\nplaintiffs' counsel and the special master that the Legislature\nhas enacted and the Governor has signed legislation approving\nand funding a replacement facility for PNM-Main.  No later than\n10\n\nMay 1, 1997, defendants will certify to plaintiffs' counsel and\nthe special  master  that the  Legislature  has enacted  and  the\nGovernor  has  signed  legislation  to  adequately  fund  the\ntransition  to  and  operation  of  the  replacement  facility.\nFinally, no later than October 31, 1997, defendants will certify\nto plaintiffs1 counsel and the special master that PNM-Main has\nbeen replaced or that no Duran class members are housed at that\nfacility.\nIf  any  of  the  three  certifications  required  by  the\nimmediately  preceding  paragraph  fail  to  occur  in  a  timely\nfashion, the parties will meet no later than thirty days after\nthe  date  the  certification  was  due  to  discuss  what  further\nrepairs, renovations and improvements must be made to PNM-Main\nto permit  its use on a long-term basis as a facility housing\nDuran class members.  If the parties do not come to an agreement\non those  further repairs, renovations and improvements within\nninety days  after consultations  commence, the special  master\nwill audit living conditions at PNM-Main, using whatever expert\nconsultation is required, and file a report recommending further\nrepairs, renovations and improvements, if any, that will permit\nits use on a long-term basis to house Duran class members.  The\nparties maintain, and do not waive in this Stipulation, their\nright to object to that special master's report, whether to a\nparticular factual finding or to any recommendation he makes in\nconnection with whether PNM-Main can continue to be occupied by\nDuran  class  members  and  under  what  specific  conditions.\n11\n\nMoreover, following  completion  of the process  established by\nthis paragraph, plaintiffs are free to seek appropriate relief\nfrom the court.\nExcept as provided in the immediately preceding sentence,\nplaintiffs agree to forebear from seeking remedial relief based\non  any previous  findings  of the Court's experts  relating  to\nliving conditions at PNM-Main so long as defendants comply with\nthe terms of this  Stipulation; provided, however, plaintiffs\nspecifically reserve the right to seek further remedial orders\nfrom the Court in the event that additional violations of the\nCourt's Order on  Living Conditions are discovered  during the\nterm of this Stipulation.  With respect to PNM-Main only, and\nonly until the replacement facility is constructed or PNM-Main\nno  longer  houses  Duran  class  members,  defendants  agree  to\nforebear from moving to vacate the Decree; from seeking self-\nmonitoring status; and from moving to modify the Court's order\non living conditions.\nPlaintiffs  shall  dismiss, with prejudice, their  pending\nMotion for Order to Show Cause and For Further Remedial Orders,\nwhich was filed on December 21, 1994.\nAPPROVED*\nFOR THE PLAINTIFFS:\nP.O.

The parties hereby amend that stipulation to read in its entirety as follows:\nDefinitions:\nAdult Basic Education  ABE\nCentral Arizona Detention Center  CADC\nCentral New Mexico Correctional Facility  ;  CNMCF\nDallas County Jail and other county jail facilities in Texas  Texas Facility (ies)\nInmate Literacy Program  ILP\nNew Mexico Corrections Department  NMCD\nNew or additional non-NMCD prison facilities\nin New Mexico, including additional prison bed capacity at\nfacilities already under contract, beds in new or\nadditional non-NMCD New Mexico facilities not currently\nunder contract (e.g., Roswell,  Dona Ana), and beds\nat one or more new facilities in New Mexico,\nconstructed by private vendors or counties  New NM Beds\nDuran v. Apodaca\niiiiHiuiig\nPC-NM-001-042\n\nPrison beds currently operated by NMCD in New Mexico,\nand prison beds built and operated in the future by NMCD in\nNew Mexico  NMCD Beds\nReception and Diagnostic Center  RDC\nSouthern New Mexico Correctional Facility  SNMCF\nVincent M. Nathan or W. David Arnold  special master\nWestern New Mexico Correctional Facility  WNMCF\nA.  Use of Texas Facilities\n1.  So long as defendants are complying with Section D of this Amended Stipulation,\nhave no available cells for housing medium security prisoners, and have assigned no more than\n140 medium security prisoners to dayroom beds at CNMCF and SNMCF pursuant to Section C\nof this Amended Stipulation, defendants may assign no more than 350 medium security prisoners\nto the Dallas County Jail or to another jail facility in Texas, (\"Texas facility\" or \"Texas\nfacilities\"). The following conditions will apply to the assignment of prisoners to a Texas\nfacility:\na.  Defendants will ensure that officials at the Dallas County Jail expand or\npermit expansion of correspondence privileges (increased availability of\nwriting materials, envelopes, and stamps) and access to legal materials\n(expansion of the collection of New Mexico legal research materials), as\nrecommended to NMCD officials by the special master.\nb.  Any Texas jail to which prisoners are transferred, other than the Dallas\nCounty Jail, must be of at least comparable quality to the Dallas County\nJail in terms of physical plant and the provision of services to prisoners,\n2\n\nincluding correspondence and legal access services described in subsection\nA. La of this Amended Stipulation. Prior to the transfer of any prisoner to\na Texas jail other than the Dallas County Jail, the special master will\ninspect the proposed facility and certify its comparability to the Dallas\nCounty Jail.\nc.  Defendants may only transfer newly received prisoners to Texas facilities\ndirectly from the RDC. All such prisoners must be classified as medium\nsecurity, and no such prisoner can be under indictment or be in the process\nof pursuing a direct appeal of his criminal conviction at the time of his\ntransfer.1  Defendants may apply other criteria (e.g., chronic medical or\nmental health condition, unusual hardship) to exclude prisoners from\neligibility for transfer to a Texas facility, but the failure to identify a\nsufficient number of medium security prisoners at the RDC who are\neligible for transfer to a Texas facility will not constitute an excuse for\nnoncompliance with any provision of this Amended Stipulation.\nd.  No prisoner assigned to a Texas facility will be assigned to such a facility\na second time unless that person's conduct results in his readmission to the\nNMCD as a new admission to the RDC. \"Readmission to the NMCD as a\nnew admission\" includes persons returned as parole violators; persons\nreturned as probation violators; violators of conditions of reintegration;\n1  The exclusion of prisoners under indictment or pursuing a direct appeal does not\nencompass prisoners who are in the process of making a collateral attack, by writ of habeas\ncorpus or otherwise, on their conviction, plea, or sentence.\n\nand persons who were previously incarcerated, then released, then\nadmitted pursuant to a new or separate conviction.\ne.  All prisoners assigned to a Texas facility in the future will be returned to\nand physically housed in New Mexico or the CADC  as quickly as\npossible and in no event longer than 180 calendar days from the date the\nprisoner leaves the RDC.\n2.  Upon their return to New Mexico, all prisoners currently assigned to a Texas\nfacility and all prisoners assigned to a Texas facility in the future will be transferred directly to a\nfacility in New Mexico other than the RDC.2\n3.  Because of the lack of work and educational opportunities in Texas facilities,\nevery prisoner currently assigned to a Texas facility and every prisoner assigned to a Texas\nfacility in the future will earn day-for-day good time, regardless of the prisoner's employment or\nprogrammatic status in a Texas facility, subject to NMCD's current regulations governing\ntermination and forfeiture of good time for misconduct and consistent with the requirements of\nNMSA section 33-2-34.  In addition, every prisoner currently assigned to a Texas facility and\nevery prisoner assigned to a Texas facility in the future will, for the first four months he is\nhoused in the Texas facility, be awarded six days of good time for each month or portion thereof\nhe is housed in a Texas facility, assuming he is otherwise eligible for good time awards and\nsubject to applicable NMCD good time policies and procedures, and will, for the remaining time\nhe is housed in the Texas facility, be awarded eight days of good time for each month or portion\n2  That \"facility other than the RDC\" could be an NMCD Bed, a New NM Bed or, if\nthe inmate has been reclassified as minimum or minimum-restrict, a contract facility in which\nminimum and minimum-restrict beds are leased by NMCD.\n\nthereof he is housed in a Texas facility, assuming he is otherwise eligible for good time awards\nand subject to applicable NMCD good time policies and procedures.  NMCD will either ensure\nthat sufficient educational slots are available at Texas facilities to ensure that inmates in the ILP\nobtain the educational programming needed to permit them to earn maximum good time for\nwhich they are otherwise eligible, or ensure that if sufficient educational programming slots are\nnot available, ILP inmates are excused from the education requirements so that they can eam the\nmaximum good time for which they are otherwise eligible.\n4.  Any prisoner assigned to a Texas facility in the future may file a classification\nappeal challenging his designation as medium security or any other element of the classification,\nand any such appeal will be resolved in accordance with the classification appeals policies of the\nNMCD. Such an appeal, however, will not be subject to the special provisions and limitations\ncontrolling an appeal of an out-of-state transfer. Any complaint concerning assignment to a\nTexas facility (as opposed to complaints about other facets of the classification process) will be\ntreated as a grievance and will be resolved under the grievance procedures of the NMCD. If the\nfiling of a classification appeal would otherwise be timely, NMCD will accept classification\nappeals from prisoners after their transfer to a Texas facility.  Moreover, defendants also will\nestablish a procedural mechanism by which prisoners assigned to a Texas facility can submit\ngrievances to NMCD officials. Defendants will provide the special master with a copy of any\nsuch classification appeal or grievance by a prisoner selected for transfer to a Texas facility,\nincluding prisoners currently assigned to a Texas facility, and the special master will review\nthese appeals and grievances and communicate with NMCD officials to ensure that fair and\ntimely decisions are rendered.\n\n5.  Provisions to the contrary in this Section A notwithstanding, defendants may\nhouse voluntary administrative segregation inmates at a Texas facility under the following terms\nand conditions:\na.  Prior to any such transfers, the special master will visit the Texas facility\nand prepare an informal report for the parties certifying its suitability for\nhousing voluntary administrative segregation inmates.  If the special\nmaster determines that the Texas facility is not suitable for this purpose,\nthe parties will utilize the dispute resolution mechanisms of paragraph F.3\nof this Amended Stipulation.\nb.  All voluntary administrative segregation inmates in the Texas facility will\nbe housed in single occupancy cells and will have access to a day room.\nc.  The following inmates will not be included in the pool of voluntary\nadministrative segregation inmates eligible for transfer to a Texas facility\nunder this Amended Stipulation:  (i) inmates whose medical and mental\nhealth needs preclude transfer in the professional judgment of NMCD\nmedical and mental health staff, (ii) inmates who have an IEP/transition\nplan or who are in the DDEA-eligibility evaluation process (as those terms\nare defined in the Termination Plan — Part I [Special Education]),  (iii)\npretrial detainees and inmates facing pending charges if those charges\nwere not brought as a result of the inmate's in-prison activities, and (iv)\ninmates whose cases are on direct appeal and who are within seven months\nof their convictions.\n\nd.  No voluntary administrative segregation inmate transferred to a Texas\nfacility under this agreement will be housed at such facility for more than\none year, at which time the inmate must be returned to an NMCD Bed or a\nNew NM Bed.\ne.  The following programs will be available to all voluntary administrative\nsegregation inmates transferred to a Texas facility:  (i) access to mental\nhealth services; (ii) access to medical services; (iii) a recreation schedule\nequivalent to that offered to general population New Mexico inmates at\nthe Texas facility at the time the first voluntary segregation inmates arrive\nat the facility; (iv) visiting; (v) access to law library and general library\nservices; (vi)  access to religious programs; and (vii) educational\nprogramming that includes an initial review of each inmate's educational\nstatus, development of an appropriate educational course (as determined\nby an educational professional) through the ABE level for each inmate\nwho chooses to participate (which educational programming may be in a\ngroup or individual setting) and, for those for whom educational services\nare provided individually,  individual contact with an educational staff\nmember no less than twice each week.\nf.  To the maximum extent possible, defendants will house administrative\nsegregation inmates only at the North unit.  Unless all beds at the North\nunit are occupied pursuant to this paragraph, no inmate will be housed in\nadministrative segregation at PNM South for longer than thirty days.\nDefendants will house inmates in long-term involuntary administrative\n7\n\nsegregation only at the North Unit unless sufficient beds are not available\nfor that purpose.  No involuntary administrative segregation inmate will\nbe housed at a satellite unit for more than thirty days unless every bed at\nthe North unit is occupied by an involuntary administrative segregation\ninmate; provided, however, that in exceptional cases (e.g., enemies, high\nrisk protective custody) voluntary administrative segregation inmates may\nbe assigned to the North unit even though all beds there are not completely\noccupied by involuntary administrative segregation inmates, and in that\ncase involuntary administrative segregation inmates may be housed at a\nsatellite facility for more than thirty days, but in no case for longer than is\nneeded to locate a bed for them at the North unit and transfer them to that\nfacility.  Inmates in voluntary administrative segregation may be placed at\nthe North unit if they require that level of protection and/or supervision or\nif beds are available.  If defendants have complied with all of the\nrequirements of this section, defendants may house voluntary\nadministrative segregation inmates at one or more satellite facilities.  The\nfollowing will be available to administrative segregation inmates housed at\nsatellite facilities: (i) access to mental health services; (ii) access to\nmedical services; (iii) a minimum of one hour outdoor recreation per day,\nweather permitting; (iv) visiting; (v) access to law library and general\nlibrary services; (vi)  access to religious programs; and (vii) educational\nprogramming that includes an initial review of each inmate's educational\nstatus, development of an appropriate educational course (as determined\n8\n\nby an educational professional) through the ABE level for each inmate\nwho chooses to participate (which educational programming may be in a\ngroup or individual setting) and, for those for whom educational services\nare provided individually,  individual contact with an educational staff\nmember no less than twice each week.\nB.  Use Of CADC\n1.  Under the terms and conditions established by this Amended Stipulation,\ndefendants may transfer medium or close custody inmates to CADC.\n2.  An inmate may be housed at CADC no more than one year unless he volunteers in\nwriting to stay longer; provided, however, that if the 1998 New Mexico legislature provides\nNMCD with no funding for additional NMCD Beds or for New NM Beds, the parties will meet\nand confer immediately following the adjournment of the 1998 legislature to discuss the impact\nof such failure on this subsection, and will include the results of those discussions in the status\nreport that the parties file with the three-judge court no later than forty-five days following the\nadjournment of the 1998 legislature.  If the parties cannot agree on these issues at the time of the\nstatus report, each party will be free to pursue whatever legal remedies are available, which as to\ndefendants may include a motion under the PLRA; provided, however, that defendants will not\nfile a motion under the PLRA as to population issues prior to the filing of the joint status report.\n3.  The following inmates will not be included in the pool eligible for transfer to\nCADC under this Amended Stipulation:  (a) inmates whose medical and mental health needs\npreclude transfer in the professional judgment of NMCD medical and mental health staff, (b)\ninmates who have an IEP/transition plan or who are in the IDEA-eligibility evaluation process\n(as those terms are defined in the Termination Plan ~ Part I [Special Education]), (c)  pretrial\n9\n\ndetainees and inmates facing pending charges if those charges were not brought as a result of the\ninmate's in-prison activities, (d) inmates whose cases are on direct appeal and who are within\nseven months of their convictions, (e) inmates housed in honor units, and (f) up to thirteen Duran\nclass representatives designated by plaintiffs' counsel; provided, however, that this agreement\nnot to transfer a certain number of class representatives to  CADC confers on those designated\nclass representatives no particular status or right with respect to the Duran orders.\n4.  The following inmates will be initially excluded from the pool of inmates eligible\nto be transferred to CADC under this agreement unless all other medium and close custody\ninmates have been disqualified for transfer: (a) inmates employed in prison industry jobs, food\nservice, or clerical positions; (b) inmates who have been incarcerated in the Dallas County Jail or\nthe Central Texas Parole Violator Facility as a result of a transfer from NMCD; (c)  inmates\nenrolled in college or vocational education programs; (d) inmates housed in Housing Unit One at\nthe North facility; and (e) inmates who receive weekly visits.  Inmates will be selected for\ntransfer from this list in reverse order (i.e., inmates who receive weekly visits will be transferred\nbefore inmates housed in Housing Unit One, and so forth).\n5.  Inmates transferred to CADC under this agreement will earn an additional six\ndays of good time for each month or portion thereof they are housed out of state, assuming they\nare otherwise eligible for good time awards and subject to applicable NMCD good time policies\nand procedures, for the first four months they are housed in CADC. Thereafter, inmates will earn\nan additional eight days of good time for each month or portion thereof they are housed at\nCADC, assuming they are otherwise eligible for good time awards and subject to applicable\nNMCD good time policies and procedures.  Any inmate who is transferred to CADC having\npreviously been housed at a Texas facility will earn an additional eight days of good time for\n10\n\neach month or portion thereof they are housed at CADC, assuming he is otherwise eligible for\ngood time awards and subject to applicable NMCD good time policies and procedures, starting\nwith the first month that he is housed at CADC; provided, however, that no inmate will earn\nmore than eight days of additional good time in any given month based on his incarceration\nduring that month at a Texas Facility, CADC, or both.  NMCD will either ensure that sufficient\neducational slots are available at CADC to ensure that inmates in the ILP obtain the educational\nprogramming needed to permit them to earn maximum good time for which they are otherwise\neligible, or ensure that if sufficient educational programming slots are not available, ILP inmates\nare excused from the education requirements so that they can earn the maximum good time for\nwhich they are otherwise eligible.\n6.  Defendants will assign one NMCD classification officer to CADC for at least the\nfirst sixty days after the first group of NMCD inmates is transferred to CADC.  This\nclassification officer will conduct joint classification meetings with the staff of CADC for the\npurpose of making housing assignments and will be available for other classification\nconsultations with inmates and staff.\n7.  Medium and close custody inmates will be housed in cells in New Mexico upon\ntheir return from CADC to the maximum extent feasible consistent with sound corrections policy\nand consistent with the assignments to cells of inmates who have been assigned to a day room\nbed.\n8.  The special master has prepared an informational memorandum that defendants\nwill provide to all inmates assigned to CADC.\n9.  Defendants have promulgated and will continue to maintain guidelines on what\nproperty inmates may possess at CADC and what steps will be taken to safeguard inmate\n11\n\nproperty that cannot be possessed at CADC. Inmates will be able to take with them to CADC\nproperty that is permitted at CADC under these guidelines.\n10.  NMCD policy CD-081601, revised May 15,1996, paragraph D, page 6-7 (appeal\nprocess), will apply to inmates assigned to CADC.\n11.  Defendants will ensure that security staff are assigned at CADC as provided in\nthis paragraph B.I 1. At CADC, two fifty bed housing units contain multiple occupancy rooms\nof six and eight beds each. These two housing units will be staffed with one security officer to\nroam both units on the first and second shifts. On the third shift, an additional security officer\n(for a total of two) will be assigned to roam these two housing units, so that at least one security\nofficer will be assigned to each separate housing area; provided  however, that NMCD is not\nT\nrequired to ensure that an additional security officer is assigned to these two housing areas on the\nthird shift unless and until both housing units containing multiple occupancy rooms are occupied\nby two or more inmates.\n12.  Plaintiffs' willingness to enter into this Amended Stipulation is based on their\nunderstanding of the conditions of confinement at CADC as observed by the court's special\nmaster and reported to them by him.  If plaintiffs obtain evidence that those conditions of\nconfinement have been materially altered during the term of this Amended Stipulation, they may\npresent that evidence to the special master, and the mechanisms established by paragraphs F.3(a),\n(b), and (c) of this Amended Stipulation will be employed to address plaintiffs' concerns. If the\nuse of those mechanisms results in formal legal action by plaintiffs seeking abrogation or\nmodification of this Amended Stipulation, paragraph F.4 of this Amended Stipulation also will\nbe effective.\n12\n\n13.  Defendants will not assign administrative segregation inmates to CADC.\nC.  Use of Dav Rooms\nIn order to provide housing for medium security prisoners3 for whom no cell beds are\navailable in spite of measures taken by defendants pursuant to Section D of this Amended\nStipulation, and only upon continued compliance with Section D of this Amended Stipulation,\ndefendants will assign such prisoners to beds in a day room (\"day room beds\") only at SNMCF\nand CNMCF.  Defendants may assign prisoners to no more than 70 such beds at CNMCF and to\nno more than 70 such beds at SNMCF, for a total of 140 day room beds.  In addition, if beds in\ncells are not available at the RDC, defendants may continue to assign prisoners to no more than\n45 day room beds at the RDC at WNMCF, or if the RDC is moved from WNMCF, up to 45\ninmates may be assigned to beds in day rooms at the new location of the RDC, except that no\nday room beds may be employed at the PNM complex; provided further that if the RDC is\nmoved to CNMCF or SNMCF, defendants will assign no more than a total of 100 inmates to\nbeds in day rooms at such unit (including inmates at the RDC), provided that the number of\ninmates assigned to day room beds at the RDC located at such facility may exceed 45 so long as\nthe total number of inmates assigned to day room beds at that facility does not exceed 100.\nD.  Other Population Measures\n1.  Defendants, on a continuing and ongoing basis, will develop and implement all\nfeasible means to maximize the availability and use of all medium security beds in cells within\nthe NMCD. Defendants will work closely with the special master to accomplish these objectives.\n3  In the absence of specific language to the contrary, all references to \"inmate,\"\n\"prisoner,\" \"prisoners,\" or \"medium security prisoners\" throughout this Amended Stipulation\ninclude only male prisoners.\n13\n\nThe special master will maintain ongoing communication with plaintiffs' counsel to apprise the\nlatter of progress on these matters and will keep plaintiffs' counsel fully informed of all efforts\ndefendants take or decline to take to maximize the availability and use of all medium security\ncell beds within the NMCD.\n2.  NMCD will establish and maintain a Central Office review process for all\nforfeitures of good time longer than 90 days and will promulgate a CD policy governing that\nreview process.\n3.  No later than September 1,1997, NMCD will implement the CD Policy attached\nhereto as Exhibit B in connection with restoration of forfeited good time.\n4.  NMCD will implement the plan for drug courts attached hereto as Exhibit C.\n5.  NMCD will implement the plan to divert technical parole violators to community\ncorrections attached hereto as Exhibit D.\n6.  NMCD will continue with its present policy of having a staff member at the\nCentral Office available up to full time to help inmates ready for parole develop an acceptable\nparole plan; this staff person will assist inmates within 90 days of parole eligibility who request\nassistance in expediting the parole process, and will serve as the Secretary's designee at the\nCentral Office to review appeals on grievances relating to parole eligibility, including time\ncalculations and good time awards. As part of their periodic classification reviews of inmates on\ntheir caseloads, NMCD unit case workers will prepare a list of all inmates on their caseload who\nare within ninety days of parole eligibility but who do not yet have a parole plan in place. The\ncase workers will prepare a list of these names and transmit the list at the end of each month to\nthe staff member in the central office, and will inform such inmates of the availability and\nidentity of the central office staff person to assist with development of a parole plan.\n14\n\n7.  NMCD will issue the Memorandum attached as Exhibit E concerning how dual\nsentences are to be served.\n8.  NMCD will continue to review carefully classification overrides to ensure that\npublic safety, staff and inmate safety and security, and population concerns are fairly and\nappropriately addressed.\n9.  No later than thirty days following execution of this agreement, NMCD will\nrevise the classification scoring form to increase the length of sentence needed for 13 points from\n3.5 years to 4 years, and to remove absconding from community corrections as a 13 point item,\nso long as the absconding did not result in criminal charges for escape.\nE.  Future Population Measures\n1.  Defendants will continue to use all reasonable efforts to identify and obtain New\nNM Beds.\n2.  If defendants assign medium, close, or administrative segregation custody\ninmates to new NMCD Beds or to New NM Beds, such beds to which medium, close or\nadministrative segregation custody inmates are assigned will meet the Standards for Adult\nCorrectional Facilities of the American Correctional Association and the NMCD policies\nidentified and set forth in Exhibit A hereto; will house inmates in cells of at least 120 square feet\nif inmates are housed in double occupancy cells; will provide inmates with full-time work of at\nleast 25 hours per week, full-time education of at least 20 hours per week, or a combination of\nwork and education of at least 25 hours per week; will apply applicable NMCD Policies on\nclassification and discipline; and will not house inmates in day rooms unless such housing is\nrequired to avoid housing inmates out of state and unless such housing complies with section\nn.B.4, 5, and 6 and II.C.2 of the 1991 Settlement Agreement and this Amended Stipulation.  If\n15\n\nthe parties disagree on whether day room housing is required to avoid out of state housing,\nparagraph F.3 of this Amended Stipulation will be employed to resolve the dispute.\n3.  The provisions of 1JE.2 of this Amended Stipulation will apply to any prison beds\nauthorized and funded by the New Mexico legislature between the date of execution of this\nAmended Stipulation and December 31,1998 (such new prison beds, which may be New NM\nBeds, new NMCD Beds, or some combination thereof, are referred to hereinafter as \"1998\nBeds\")- Moreover, defendants will take the following steps with respect to such 1998 Beds:\na.  ' NMCD will (i) calculate the total number of jobs available throughout\nNMCD (all custody categories) for inmates in prison industries at the time\nthis Amended Stipulation is executed (\"Current Job Slots\");  (ii) calculate\nthe total authorized daily census for vocational education available\nthroughout NMCD (all custody categories) at the time this Amended\nStipulation is executed (\"Current Voc. Ed.  Slots\"); (iii) calculate the\ncombined total of Current Job Slots and Current Voc.  Ed.  Slots (\"Total\nCurrent Slots\"); and (iv) compare the Total Current Slots to the current\nNMCD inmate population (in all custody categories), thereby creating the\n\"Current Ratio\";\nb.  Defendants will request sufficient funding from the 1998 New Mexico\nlegislature to provide new or expanded prison industry jobs, vocational\neducation opportunities, or both, to inmates in order to maintain (within a\n5% range) the Current Ratio for all 1998 Beds (i.e., if Total Current Slots\nexist for one in ten inmates, and if the total number of 1998 Beds is 1,000,\ndefendants will be obligated to request sufficient funding for a combined\n16\n\ntotal of least 95 new or expanded prison industry jobs, vocational\neducation opportunities, or some combination thereof);\nc.  Defendants will make the budget request to the 1998 New Mexico\nlegislature for new or expanded prison industry jobs, new or expanded\nvocational education opportunities, or some combination thereof,  to\ninmates in order to maintain (within a 5% range) the Current Ratio for all\n1998 Beds a budget priority, consistent with other budget priorities related\n• to Duran;\nd.  Defendants also may create new or expanded prison industries\nopportunities, vocational education opportunities, or both, without\ncomplete reliance on state funding (i.e., through a joint venture with\nprivate enterprise), and such opportunities will count toward maintaining\nthe Current Ratio for 1998 Beds;\ne.  New prison industries jobs, and new vocational education opportunities,\ninclude all programs not operational at the time this Amended Stipulation\nis executed (i.e., programs that are not authorized and funded at the time\nthis Amended Stipulation is executed), at any facility housing inmates\n(i.e., not just facilities housing medium, close, or maximum custody\ninmates);\nf.  Expanded prison industries jobs and expanded vocational educational\nopportunities include all increases in authorized inmate personnel levels at\nprison industry operations extant at the time this Amended Stipulation is\nexecuted, and all increases in the authorized daily census of vocational\n17\n\neducation due to expansion of existing programs that occurs after this\nAmended Stipulation is executed, at any facility housing inmates (i.e., not\njust facilities housing medium, close, or maximum custody inmates);\ng.  For the purpose of determining if the Current Ratio is maintained for 1998\nBeds, prison industry jobs and vocational education opportunities will be\nevaluated in the same manner as they presently are by the special master in\nhis audits of inmate activity (i.e., a part time job or assignment to part time\n•  education count separately as Current Slots, and count separately in\nevaluating the maintenance of the Current Ratio,  if the part time positions\ntogether result in full time programming).  For NMCD prison\nindustry/vocational education programs that combine hands-on vocational\ntraining with work study, for which NMCD can demonstrate\nimplementation of legitimate vocational education curriculum plans,\nNMCD may count positions in such programs as separate vocational\neducation slots and prison industry slots, so long as these positions meet\nthe other requirements of this subparagraph (i.e., so long as positions that\nare part time [less than 20 hours per week of education and less than 25\nhours per week of work] would, if combined as is presently done in the\nspecial master's inmate activity audits such as the 54* Report, together\nresult in full time programming).\n4.  Any dispute over the implementation of fE.3 of this Amended Stipulation will be\naddressed using the dispute resolution mechanisms of fF.3 prior to the filing of any enforcement\nmotion, whether for contempt or otherwise.\n18\n\nF.  Other Agreements\n1.  Plaintiffs have withdrawn, without prejudice, their January 29,1996 Motion for\nTemporary Restraining Order and Motion For Injunctive and Other Remedial Relief.\n2.  Effective April 15, 1997, so long as defendants comply with the provisions of this\nAmended Stipulation and with paragraphs HA, B, and C of the June 10,1991 Settlement\nAgreement, plaintiffs will not file any legal action challenging the assignment of inmates to\nTexas facilities or the assignment of up to 70 inmates to day room beds at SNMCF and CNMCF,\nrespectively, and plaintiffs will continue to refrain from filing any such action until the opening\nand funding of New NM Beds or additional NMCD Beds that results in the availability of at least\n600 new prison beds (funding of new beds that results in the creation of at least 600 beds is\nhereinafter referred to as the \"Dayroom Triggering Event\").  Upon the Dayroom Triggering\nEvent and thereafter defendants will not assign inmates to day room beds at those two units or to\nTexas facilities so long as this Amended Stipulation is in effect. In addition, so long as\ndefendants comply with the provisions of this Amended Stipulation and with paragraphs II. A, B,\nand C of the June 10,1991 Settlement Agreement, defendants may assign up to 45 inmates to\nday room beds at the RDC; provided, however, that if defendants move the RDC from WNMCF,\nup to 45 inmates may be assigned to beds in day rooms at the new location of the RDC, except\nthat no day room beds may be employed at the PNM complex; provided further that if the RDC\nis moved to CNMCF or SNMCF, and if the Dayroom Triggering Event has not occurred,\ndefendants will assign no more than a total of 100 inmates to beds in day rooms at such unit\n(including inmates at the RDC), provided that the number of inmates assigned to day room beds\nat the RDC located at such facility may exceed 45 so long as the total number of inmates\nassigned to day room beds at that facility does not exceed 100. After the Dayroom Triggering\n19\n\nEvent has occurred, defendants may assign up to 45 inmates to beds in dayrooms at the RDC\nfacility wherever it is located even though defendants may not assign inmates to beds in\ndayrooms at other facilities because the Dayroom Triggering Event has occurred.\n3.  In the event plaintiffs' counsel believe defendants are in noncompliance with a\nprovision of this Amended Stipulation, they may file a legal action, for contempt or otherwise,\nchallenging the assignment of inmates to Texas facilities or to CADC or the assignment of\ninmates to day room beds, but only following the exhaustion of all of the following steps:\na.  Based upon information received from the special master pursuant to\nSection D.I of this Amended Stipulation, or upon information received\nfrom other sources, plaintiffs' counsel formally request an investigation\nand written report by the special master concerning defendants' alleged\nnoncompliance with any provision of this Amended Stipulation.\nb.  The special master conducts an investigation, which he has represented to\nthe parties he will accomplish as promptly as possible, and issues a written\nreport containing a finding of noncompliance with this Amended\nStipulation.\nc.  The parties, within ten business days following the special master's\nissuance of a written report containing a finding of such noncompliance,\nfail to reach agreement during the course of good faith negotiations\nregarding instances of noncompliance found by the special master.\nd.  No provision of this Amended Stipulation abrogates the provision, in\nsection II.E of the 1991 Settlement Agreement that plaintiffs will not\nmove the court to prohibit all use of day room beds.\n20\n\n4.  If plaintiffs file a legal action pursuant to paragraph F.3 of this Amended\nStipulation, defendants will be free to raise all available defenses in response to such action,\nincluding challenging the special master's finding of non-compliance.\n5.  Defendants may continue to use beds at CADC as follows: (a) if beds are not\navailable in New Mexico to house all class members in cells (except for class members who may\nbe housed in day rooms pursuant to this Amended Stipulation); (b) if defendants have utilized all\nother internal mechanisms available for reducing the population in NMCD facilities (e.g., steps\ntaken pursuant to this Amended Stipulation); and (c) only until the opening and funding of New\nNM Beds or additional NMCD Beds that results in the availability of at least 1,200 new prison\nbeds in addition to the 600 beds referenced in paragraph F.2 above.\n6.  The undersigned parties hereby agree that each retains, and does not by signing\nthis Amended Stipulation waive, their legal positions with respect to the transfer of inmates out\nof state; provided, however, that defendants agree that in any litigation activity that occurs in\nconnection with this Amended Stipulation or the transfers that take place hereunder they will not\nassert that, solely as a result of the inmates' physical absence from the state of New Mexico or as\na result of plaintiffs' consent to this Amended Stipulation the court does not have jurisdiction (if\nit had any) over the inmates in CADC or over the transfers that take place under this Amended\nStipulation.\n7.  No provisions of the court's orders in this cause relating to conditions of\nconfinement, apart from the provisions of this Amended Stipulation, will apply to prisoners\nwhile they are housed in a Texas facility.\n8.  No part of the court's orders in Durcm vs. Johnson except the applicable portions\nof this Amended Stipulation will apply to NMCD inmates while they are housed in CADC.\n21\n\n9.  No part of the court's orders in Duran vs. Johnson except the applicable portions\nof this Amended Stipulation will apply to NMCD inmates while they are housed in New NM\nBeds.\n10.  This Amended Stipulation will remain in effect until December 31, 1998, and the\ncourt's enforcement powers with respect to this Amended Stipulation will not extend beyond that\ndate.\n11.  The parties will file this Amended Stipulation for the court's review and approval.\n22\n\ny  H.

The parties  have  reached  agreement  on several  areas  of  policy  and\nprocedure  for  operation  of  the  Penitentiary  of  New  Mexico  and  any  other\nState  correctional  facility  which  will  house  class  Plaintiffs,  except  for\nminimum  security  facilities.  These  areas  of  agreement  are  more  fully  set\nforth  in  partial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein  and  in  various  policy\nstatements  which  are  attached  to  this  agreement  as  Exhibits  A through  H.\nThese  policy  statements  will  be adopted  by  the  Defendants  within seven  (7)\ndays from  the  date  the  Court  Order  approving  this  agreement  becomes  final.\n'•;<> 2.  These  policy  statements  and  the  partial  consent  decrees  on  file\nherein  may  include  specific  requirements  and  procedures  beyond  what  is\nrequired  by  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  the  Constitution  of  the\nState  of  New  Mexico,  the  Federal  Civil  Rights  Act,  the  New  Mexico  Tort\nClaims  Act|  or  any  other  constitutional,  statutory,  or  common  law\nrequirement.  This  agreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the\nI partial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein  are  not  to  be  construed  to  establish\nor  change  the  standard  of  culpability  for  civil  or  criminal  liability  of\nDuran v. Apodaca\nPC-NM-001-050\n\nany official,  employee,  agent,  or representative  of the State of  New-Mexico\nother  than  for  the  sole  and  limited  purpose  of  enforcement  of  this\nagreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees\non  file  herein.\n3.  This  agreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial\nconsent  decrees  on  file  herein  were voluntarily  and mutually agreed  upon by\nthe  Defendants  and  Plaintiffs  as  a  compromised  settlement  of  disputes\nbetween  the  parties  and  neither  the  partial  consent  decrees,  nor  this\nagreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  constitute  admissions  that  any\nprevious  or  existing  condition,  policy,  procedure,  or  acts  or  omissions  of\nthe  Department  of  Corrections  and  the  Penitentiary  of  New  Mexico  or  any\nstate  .official,  employee,  or  agent  was,  or  is,  in  any  way  improper,\nnegligent,  unconstitutional,  or  in  violation  of  any  rights  of  the  Plaintiff\nclass.  Nothing  in  this  agreement  or  the  partial  consent  decrees  on  file\nherein  constitute  findings  of  fact  or  law  with  respect  to  the  claims  or\ndefenses  of  the  parties  in  Duran  v.  Apodaca.\n4.  This  agreement  should  not  be  admissible  in  evidence  in  any\nproceedings  or  trials  other  than  for  the  sole  and  limited  purpose  of\nenforcement  of  this  agreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the\npartial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein.  Specifically,  it  is understood  and\nagreed  that  Rules  407  and  408  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  and  the\nAdvisory  Committee's  notes  to  Rule  407 and  408 and of  Rules  407 and 408 of\nthe  New  Mexico  Rules  of  Evidence  are  applicable  to  this  agreement  and  the\npolicies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees  on file  herein.\n5.  In  the  event  of  an  emergency  caused  by  a  riot,  fire,  or  other\nevents  at  the  facility  not  caused  by  the  Defendants,  their  agents,\nemployees,  successors  in  office,  and  those  acting  in  concert  with  them\nwhich make  compliance  with  the  terms of  this  agreement  and  the  policies\n-2-\n\nJf,\nattached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein  impossible,\nit  may  be  necesary  to  temporarily  suspend  certain  provisions  of  this\nagreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees\non  file  herein.  In  such  event,  the  Defendants  must  formally  declare  a\nstate  of  emergency,  and,  as  soon  as  practical,  but  no later  than  five  (5)\ndays  after  such  declaration,  notify  the  Plaintiffs  and  their  counsel  of  the\nreasons  which  necessitated  the  suspension  of  such  suspended  provisions.\nThe  Defendants  will  also  notify  counsel  for  Plaintiffs  of  the  expected\nduration  of  such  suspension  and  the  plan  of  the  Defendants  to  restore  said\nprovisions.  , If  the  Plaintiffs  or  their  counsel  believe  those  suspensions\nand/or  their  duration  are  unjustified,  unreasonable,  or  taken  in bad  faith,\nthen  they  may  request  appropriate  relief  from  this  court.\n6.  Other  than  in times  of  emergency,  changed  circumstances  may,  in\nthe  future,  justify  some  changes  in  this  agreement  and  the  policies\nattached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein.  No change\nor  changes  may  be  made  which  will  lessen  the  benefits  provided  by  the\nagreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees\non  file  herein.  Notice  will  be  given  to  the  lawyers  for  the  Plaintiffs  at\nleast  thirty  (30)  days  prior  to  the  proposed  implementation  date.  Said\nnotice  will  contain  the  proposed  change  or  changes  and  the  reasons\ntherefore.  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiffs  will  ascertain  whether,  in  their\nopinion,  the  proposed  change  or  changes  in  any  way  lessen  the  benefits\nprovided  by  this  agreement  or  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial\nconsent  decrees  on  file  herein.  If  so,  they  will  notify  Defendants  of\ntheir  objections  and  the  reasons  therefore  within  fifteen  (15)  days.\nEfforts  will  be  made  to  informally  resolve  the  matter.  If  the  dispute\ncannot  be  resolved,  it  will  be  submitted  to  the  court.  The  burden  will\nthen  be  on  the  Defendants  to justify  that  the  change  or  changes  should  be\nmade  and  will  not  lessen  the  benefits  provided  by  the  agreement  and  the\n-3-\n\npolicies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein\nbefore  the  change  or  changes  will be  allowed.\n7.  Noncompliance  with  the agreement  and  the policies attached  hereto\nand  the  partial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein  shall  result  in  disciplinary\naction  against  any  noncomplying  state  employee(s).  This  provision  in  no\nway  limits  remedies  otherwise  available  to  the  parties  to  enforce  this\nagreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial  consent  decrees\non  file  herein.\n8.  The  parties  further  agree  that  as  of  the  date  of  this  agreement,\nthe  Plaintiff  class  in  Duran  v.  Apodaca  shall  be1 defined  as  \"all  persons\nwho  are  now,  or  in  the  future  may  be,  incarcerated  in the  Penitentiary  of\nNew Mexico at Santa Fe or at any maximum,  close or medium security  facility\nopened  for  operation  by  the  State  of  New  Mexico  after  June  12,  1980.\" All\nprovisions  of  this  agreement  will  be  followed  at  those  institutions  except\nthose  provisions  which  are  not  generally  applicable  and  which  are  required\nby unique  conditions  at  the  Penitentiary  of  New  Mexico  at  Santa  Fe.\n9.  The  Defendants  will  appoint  a  responsible  person  to  report  on\ncompliance  with  the  agreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the\npartial  consent  decrees  filed  herein.  Such  reports  will  be  sent  quarterly\nto  counsel  for  Plaintiffs.\n10.  The  parties  shall  submit  this  agreement  to  the  Court  in  full\nsettlement  of  all  remaining  issues  in  this  case,  except  costs  and\nattorney's  fees  and  the  parties  shall  request  that  the  Court  retain\njurisdiction  for  such  time  as  the  Court  deems  necessary  to  enforce\ncompliance  with  this  agreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the\npartial  consent  decrees  on  file  herein.\n-4-\n\nII.  Any modification of the Order of the Court which   be\n may\n-de  in the future shall modify   ^ .^\n thla  agreement  and  the\nstatements to be consistent with this Ord^r, as ^modified\nAtto\nc^xLu^\nAttorneys for Plainti\nttojrtieys for Defendants\ni\ni\nIt'\n\nEXHIBIT A\nPOLICY STATEMENT\nSUBJECT: CLASSIFICATION\n1.  The  Intake  and  Classification  Center  (ICC)  has  the  overall\nresponsibility  to  classify,  test  and  monitor  all  inmates  committed  to\nthe  Department  of  Corrections  and  to  develop  data  for  Department\nplanning  and  budget.\n2.  The  policies  and  procedures  which  govern  the  actions  of  the\nICC  will  be  written  and,  at  least  annually,  reviewed.  Relevant\npolicies  and  procedures,  including  a  description  of  criteria  for\nprograms  and  general  classification  will  be  made  available  to  all\ninmates  and  employees  as  part  of  their  orientation.  The\nclassification  manual  will  contain  all  classification  policies  and\nprocedures  for  implementing  those  policies.  The  manual  will  be  made\navailable  to  all  staff  and  will  be  updated  as  needed,  but  at  least\nannually.\n3.  Custody  classification  will  be  guided  by  rational,  objective\nstandards  derived  from  behavioral  criteria.  Inmates  will  not  be\ndisqualified  from  any  custody  classification  solely  by  virtue  of\narbitrary  and  rigid  criteria  such  as  detainers,  consecutive  sentences,\netc.  Classification  will  be  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the  accumula-\ntion  of  identified,  relevant  and  rational  factors  and  standards.\n\n\\Jf\ns^wre^^\nCLASSIFICATION\nPage  -2-\nMethods  of  continuing  validation  of  those  factors  and  standards  will\nbe developed  and implemented.  No classification  change shall be based\nsolely  on  a  finding  of  fact  by  the  disciplinary  committee  of  a\ndisciplinary  infraction,  but  all  changes  must  be  based  upon  a\nconsideration  of  the  inmate's  entire  record  under  the  standards  and\ncriteria  adopted  pursuant  to  this  agreement.\n4.  No  inmate  shall  be  classified  under  a  more  restrictive\nsecurity  designation  than  is  required  by  legitimate  security\nrequirements.\n5.  No  inmate  shall  be  subjected  to  more  restrictive  conditions\nof  confinement,  including  but  not  limited  to  freedom  of  movement\nwithin  the  institution  and  out-of-cell  time,  than  those  justified  by\nthe  inmate's  security  designation.  However,  the  Department  of\nCorrections  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  insure  that  no  inmate  be\nhoused  for  more  than  30  days  in  facilities  designed  or  designated  to\nhouse  persons  under  restrictions  and/or  security  more  secure  or\nstringent  than  that  determined  to  be  needed  for  the  inmate  by  the\nrational  classification  system.  In the  event  that  an  inmate  is  housed\nfor  more  than  30 days  in such  a  facility,  he/she  will  be  housed  under\nconditions  of  confinement  within  that  institution  which  are\nsubstantially  similar  to  those  justified  by  the  inmate's  security\ndesignation.\n\nCLASSIFICATION\nPage -3-\n6.  Jobs,  program  assignments,  housing  and  services  will  be\ndistributed  in a rational,  fair  and equitable  manner.\n7.  Each  inmate's  educational,  vocational,  medical  and\npsychological  needs  shall  be  identified  and  the  needed  programs  shall\nbe  made  available  to  inmates  consistent  with  the  provisions  in  Duran\nv.  Apodaca.  *\n8.  Provision  will  be made  for  appropriate  programs  and services\nfor  inmates  with  special  needs,  e.g.,  inmates  who are  drug  addicts,\ndrug  abusers,  alcoholics,  emotionally  disturbed,  mentally  retarded,  or\nwho  pose  high  risks  or  require  special  protection.  Regular  data  will\nbe  collected  and  maintained  on  such  populations  and  programs.\nServices  will be adapted  as  needed.\n9.  During  intake  and classification,  the  inmate  will be provided\nservices  and  resources  comparable  to  those  available  to  the  general\npopulation,  including  correspondence,  visitation,  recreation,  social\nactivities  and religious  services.\n10.  All  classification  decisions  provided  for  in  this  agreement\nwill  be  made  by  classification  committees.  Each  institutional\nclassification  committee  will  consist  of  three  persons,  including  a\nmember  of  the psychological  staff,  a member  of the program  staff  and\na  representative  of  the  correctional  security  staff.  The  ICC\nclassification  committee  will  be  composed  of  appropriate  professional\nstaff.\n\nCLASSIFICATION\nPage  -4-\n11.  Inmates  will  be  allowed  maximum  involvement  in  the\nclassification  process,  which  will  include  an  opportunity  to  know  the\nreasons  for  their  classification  and  an  opportunity  to  respond  in\nperson.  Inmates  will  be  carefully  screened  upon  their  commitment  to\nthe  Department  and  will  be  regularly  evaluated  thereafter.  Inmates\nwill  participate  in  assessing  their  needs  and  in  selecting  programs  to\nmeet  those  needs.  Classification  decisions  will  not  be  based  upon\nconfidential  information  which  inmates  have  no reasonable  opportunity\nto  rebut.\n12.  The classification  (.custody  and  program)  of  each  inmate  who\nis  serving  a  sentence  of  less  than  five  years  will  be  reviewed  at\nleast  every  ninety  (90)  days.  The  classification  of  inmates  serving\nsentences  of  five  years  or  longer  will  be  reviewed  at  least  annually.\nReviews  will  be  based  on  behavioral  observations  and  analysis  over  a\nreasonable  time  period.  Rational  criteria  and  procedures  consistent\nwith  the  other  general  principles  in  this  agreement  will  be  developed\nand  implemented.  Inmates  will  also  be  allowed  to  initiate  reviews  of\ntheir  progress,  status  and  programming.\n13.  Inmates  may  not  be  required  to  participate  in programs  with\nthe  exception  of  work  assignments.\n\n^\nCLASSIFICATION\nPage -5-\n14.  Interviews  with  inmates  in  the  classification  or  reclass-\nification  process  shall  be  conducted  in  places  that  afford  privacy\nfrom  other  inmates  or irrelevant  staff.\n15.  The  defendants,  with  assistance  from  qualified  consultants\nfrom  the  National  Institute  of  Corrections,  will  develop  a  draft  plan\nwithin  45 days  of  the  implementation  of  this  policy  statement  to meet\nthe  terms  of  this  policy  statement.  Said  plan  will  include  criteria\nfor  classification  and  reclassification,  including  standards  for  the\nutilization  of  personality  inventory  testing,  personnel,  resources  and\nequipment  needed,  and timetables  for implementation of the plan  within\na  reasonable  period  of  time.  The  draft  plan  will  be  circulated  to\ncounsel for  the parties  who may make  comments or objections  within 10\ndays.  Within  70 days  of  the signing  of  the date  of implementation  of\nthis  policy  statement  a  final  plan  will  be submitted  to  the  Court  and\nthe  parties  end  will  be implemented  by the defendants  within' the  time\nlimits  established  by  the  plan.  If  the  Plaintiffs  are  not  satisfied\nthat  the.  plan  will  bring  the  Defendants  into  compliance  with  this\npolicy  statement  within  a reasonable period  of time,  they may apply  to\nthe  Court  for  further  relief.\n\nEXHIBIT B\nPOLICY STATEMENT\nSUBJECT: LIVING CONDITIONS\n1.  No  more  than  one  prisoner  will  be  housed  in  any  cell  or\nsingle  occupancy  room.  However,  if  there  is an  emergency  caused  by\na  riot,  fire,  or  other  disaster  making  living  units  unusable,  and  no\nother  reasonable  option  is available,  two people  may be housed  in said\ncells  or  rooms  for  a  period  of  short  duration  while  arrangements  are\nmade  for  alternative  housing.\n2.

Maximum  security  classification  is  used  when  inmates  require\ncloser  supervision  and  separate  housing  from  the  general  population.\nEvery  effort  shall  be made  to  return  maximum  security  inmates  to  the\ngeneral  population  as soon  as practicable,  but  some inmates may spend\nrelatively  extensive  periods  of  time  in this  status.  Maximum  security\nclassification  is  not  for  the  purpose  of  punishment.  This  policy\nstatement  has  no application  to  those  inmates  confined  in  disciplinary\nsegregation.\n2.  The  words  \"threat  to  the  security  of  the  institution\"  or\ntheir  equivalent,  as  used  in  any  order  in  Duran  v.  Apodaca,  means  a\nsubstantial  threat  of  an  act  or  acts  of  violence  upon  others,\nsubstantial  destruction  of  state  property,  escape  or attempted  escape,\nriot  or  inciting  a  riot,  or  taking  of  hostages.  When  action  is  taken\nbased  upon  a  finding  of  a  threat  to  the  security  of  the  institution,\nthe  specific  reason (s)  comprising  the  threat  will  be  documented.\n3.  An inmate  may be placed  involuntarily  in maximum security  by\nthe  classification  committee  pursuant  to  the  criteria  stated  in  one  or\nmore of  the  following  five  subsections:\n(a)  The  classification  committee  specifically  finds  the\nfollowing:\n(i)  The  Disciplinary  Committee  has  recently  found  that  the\ninmate  has  committed  an  act  of  violence,  substantial  destruction\nof  state  property,  escape  or  attempted  escape,  riot  or  inciting  a\n\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage  -2-\nriot,  or  taking  of  hostages,  and  as  a result  of  such  finding  has  been\nsentenced  to  disciplinary  segregation;  and\n(ii)  Because  of  such  finding,  considered  along  with\nall  other  classification  and  other  relevant  data,  there  is  a\nsubstantial  likelihood  that  if  released  to  the  general  population  the\ninmate  would  present  a  substantial  threat  to  the  security  of  the\ninstitution  or  to the  safety  of  others.\n(b)  The  classification  committee  specifically  finds,  based\nupon  recent  overt  acts,  that  an inmate presents  an imminent  threat  of\nserious  bodily  harm  to  others  or  an  imminent  threat  of  escape.\nPending  action  of  the  classification  committee  under  this\nsubparagraph,  the  ranking  shift  officer  may  temporarily  house  an\ninmate in maximum security  status  until the  next,working  day,  at  which\ntime  the  classification  committee  shall  determine  whether  the  inmate\nwill  remain  in  maximum  security  status  as  set  forth  above.  The\nranking  shift  officer  who  temporarily  detains  an  inmate  under  this\nsection  will  document  the  reasons  for  the  action  and  will  give  a  copy\nof  the  document  to  the  inmate  within  eight  hours.\n(c)  The  classification  committee  specifically  finds\nthat  the  inmate  is  a  victim  of  a  violent  act  and  there  is  clear  and\nconvincing  evidence  that  if  he  remains  in  general  population  he  will\nbe  subjected  to  additional  violent  acts.\n\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage -3-\n(d)  The  classification  committee  specifically  finds  that  the\ninmate's  safety  is  jeopardized  by  an  immediate  life  threatening\nconflict  with  other  inmates  in  the  general  population  which  requires\ntemporary  separation  from  the  general  population  because  he  cannot\notherwise.be  provided  with  adequate  protection.\n(e)  The  classification  committee  specifically  finds  that\nthe  inmate  has demonstrated  a continuous,  substantial  and  documented\nviolation  of  institutional  rules.  This  sub-section  cannot  be  used  in\ncombination  with disciplinary  action  for  the same acts.  An inmate may\nnot  be  classified  in  this  category  for  more  than  5 days  at  a  time.\n4.  An  inmate  may  also  be  placed  in  maximum  security  if  the\ninmate  believes  that  housing  in  the  general  population  places  the\ninmate  in  jeopardy  of  serious  bodily  harm  and  requests  placement  in\nmaximum  security.  Inmates  requesting  assignment  to maximum  security\nmay  be  required  to  sign  a  written  request  slip,  stating  their  desire\nfor  assignment  to maximum  security.  Inmates requesting  assignment  to\nmaximum security may be placed  therein  immediately without waiting  for\nthe  formal  hearing  before  the  classification  committee.\nAny inmate  who has voluntarily placed himself  in maximum security\nstatus  will  be  reclassified  within  5  working  days  of  a  request  to  be\nreclassified.  However,  the  inmate  may  be  reclassified  into  maximum\nsecurity  status  involuntarily  if  any  of  the  conditions  of  paragraph  3\nabove  are  met.\n\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage  -4-\n5.  A statement  detailing  the  alleged  specific  facts  and  specific\nreasons  for  classifying  an inmate  into  maximum security  shall  be  given\nto  the  inmate  at  least  24  hours  prior  to  the  classification  hearing.\nIf  the  basis  for  placing  the  inmate  into  maximum  security  involves  the\ntestimony.of  a  confidential  informant,  the  disclosure  of  which  would\nplace  such  informant  in  jeopardy  of  serious  bodily  harm,  the  inmate\nshall  be  given  a  summary  of  the  facts  upon  which  maximum  security\nclassification  is  being  requested  sufficient  to  allow  him  to  challenge\nthe  truthfulness  of  the  facts  and/or  the  need  for  maximum  security\nstatus.\n6.  Prior  to  placing  an  inmate  in  maximum  security,  the\nclassification  committee  must  make  a  finding  of  fact  based  upon  a\npreponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  requirements  of  paragraph  3\nabove  have  been  met.  Prior  to  classifying  an  inmate  in  maximum\nsecurity  status,  the  classification  committee  shall  explore\nalternatives  other  than  specialized  housing  and  shall  prepare  a\nstatement  of  the  alternatives  explored  and  the  reason  for  rejecting\neach  of  them.  If  an inmate  is placed  in maximum security  housing,  the\ninmate  will be  housed  in a single  occupancy  cell  or  room  that  provides\nsafety  and  comfort  and  shall  be  allowed  to  participate  in\ninstitutional  programs  as  set  forth  herein;  however,  if  there  is  an\nemergency  caused  by  riot,  fire  or  other  disaster  making  living  units\nunusable,  two  people may be housed  in said  cells or rooms for  a period\nof  short  duration  while  arrangements  are  made  for  alternate  housing.\nEach  case  shnll  be  reviewed  on  the  basis  set  forth  in  paragraph  7,\n\n..  .,,_,..;.;, .j.r_M_...i.v!^>vr>^-.*^.;*^^\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage -5-\nwith  the goal of terminating  the separate  housing  assignment  as soon\nas  practicable.\n7.  The  classification  committee  shall  review the  status of each\ninmate  at least  every  7 days  for the first  two  months  and at least\nevery  30 days  thereafter.  More  frequent  reviews  may  be scheduled\nbased  on the request  of the case  manager  or the inmate.  At each\nreview,  the classification  committee  shall  determine  whether  there is\nsubstantial  evidence  to  indicate  that  the initial  reasons for\nclassification  into  maximum  security  still  exist.  If they  do not, the\ninmate  shall  be reclassified  out of maximum  security  status.  The\ninmate  can  appear  before  the classification  committee at each  review\nand  make a statement.  In cases  where the  inmate  refuses  to appear,\nthe committee  members shall  sign and document  the specific  reasons for\nthe  inmate's  absence  and  make  an evaluation  for the  inmate's  working\nfile.  Nothing  in  this  paragraph  shall  prevent  the  classification\ncommittee  from  making  additional  findings  pursuant  to the standards\nand  procedures set  forth  above,  to the effect  that an inmate should be\nclassified  into maximum  security  status.\n8.  If  an inmate  is  classified  maximum  security  under the\nprovisions  of  paragraph  3(b) hereof,  the inmate's  status  must be\nreviewed  by the classification  committee  within  7 days  after the\ninitial  classification  and every  7 days  thereafter,  and inmates  shall\nnot be housed  in such  status  for more  thnn 30 days.  At each  review,\nthe  classification  committee  must  make  a  specific  finding  of the\n\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage  -6-\nbehavior  justifying  continued  classification  to  maximum  security  and\ndocument  that  there  is  substantial  evidence  to  indicate  that  the\nreasons  for  the  initial  placement  still  exist.\n9.  In  each  case  of  an  inmate  classified  maximum  security\ninvoluntarily  for.  over  60  days,  the  classification  committee  shall\nestablish  a  set  schedule  of  personal  and  program  objectives  involving\ngradual  reintegration  into  the  general  population,  the  completion  of\nwhich  without  an  overt  act  evidencing  an  actual  threat  of  serious\nbodily  harm  to  others  or  escape  should  result  in  the  inmate's\nreclassification  from  maximum  security  within  an  additional  60  days.\nHowever,  if  the classification  committee documents compelling evidence\nthat  reclassification  from  maximum  security  would  produce  serious\ninjury  to  the  inmate  or  others  or  present  a  substantial  threat  to  the\nsecurity  of  the  institution,  then  neither  reclassification  nor\nreintegration  is required.  Said  evidence  must  include:\n(a)  A murder  within  the  previous  two  years;  or\n(b)  Activity  in  a  prison  riot  within  the  preceding\ntwo  years  in  which  persons  suffered  serious  bodily  harm  as  a  direct\nand  intended  result  of  action  of  the  inmate;  or\n(c)  At  least  two  recent  previous  overt  acts  causing  serious\nbodily  injury  during  reintegration  or  immediately  after  reclassifica-\ntion  from  maximum  security  under  these  provisions;  or\n\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage  -7-\n(d)  An  escape  or  attempted  escape  within  the  previous  six\nmonths; or\n(e)  The  inmate  meets  the  terms  of  paragraph  3(c)  or  (d)\nabove.\n10.  .  Prisoners  classified  maximum  security  may  be  denied  or\nremoved  from  a  program,  job,  activity,  or  canteen  privileges\ngenerally  available  to  the  population  only upon a specific,  documented\nfinding  by  the  classification  committee  of  demonstrated  necessity  for\neach  such  action  based  upon  the  recent  particular  behavior  of  the\nprisoner  or  actions  of  other  prisoners.  In  any  event,  every  prisoner\nin  maximum  security  status  shall  receive  an opportunity  for  a minimum\nof  one  hour  of  recreation  (outdoors,  weather  permitting)  daily.  In\naddition,  as  soon  as  practicable,  consistent  with  the  plan  developed\nrelating  to  inmate  activity,  every  prisoner  in maximum  security  status\nwill  receive  an  opportunity  for  at  least  five  additional  hours,  five\ndays  a  week,  of  meaningful  programmed  activities  determined  by  the\nclassification  team.  In  the  interim,  good  faith  efforts  will  be  made\nto  provide  additional  meaningful  programmed  activities  for  all  inmates\nhoused  in  maximum  security  status,  including,  for  example,  expanded\nrecreational  activity,  individually  prescribed  education  and  other\nindividual  or  group  activities  utilizing  staff  or  community\nresources.\n\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage -8-\n11.

Inmates  in  maximum  security  status  will  be  allowed  to\nretain  in  their  personal  living  area  at  least  five  books  and  all  legal\npapers.\n15.  Inmates  classified  in  maximum  security  housing  will  be\nhoused  in  single  occupancy  cells  or  rooms;  however,  if  thei\"e  is  an\nemergency  caused  by  riot,  fire  or  other  disaster  making  living  units\nunusable,  two  people  may be  housed  in said  cells  or rooms for  a period\nof  short  duration  while  arrangements  are  made  for  alternate  housing.\nThey  may  retain  their  personal  property,  as  permitted  in  general\npopulation,  unless  the  classification  team  finds  that  in  the  case  of\n\nMAXIMUM SECURITY\nPage  -9-\nan  individual  inmate,  the  removal  of  specific  designated  items  of\npersonal  property  is  essential  to  protect  the  safety  of  the  inmate  or\nothers,  a fire  hazard  would  be created,  or  the  amount  of  the  personal\nproperty  would  be  excessive  so  as  to  cause  violation  of  health,\nsanitation,  or  fire  safety  standards.  If  property  is  removed,  it  will\nbe  stored  in  a  safe  place  and  an  inventory  will  be  maintained.  All\ninmates  in  maximum  security  status  may  have  basic  items  needed  for\npersonal  hygiene,  as  well  as  items  such  as  eyeglasses,  dentures  and\nwriting  material.\n16.  A  case  manager  will  visit  five  days  per  week  all  areas  in\nwhich  maximum  security  inmates  are  housed  and  will  be  available  to\nhelp  each  inmate  who  desires  assistance  or  information.  A  qualified\nmedical  professional  will  conduct  sick  call  daily  in  each  maximum\nsecurity  living  area  and  will  examine  every  inmate  who so requests  to\ndetermine  what  medical  care,  if  any,  is  required.  A  log  will  be\nmaintained  documenting  each  visit  and  each  inmate  contact.\n17.  A  qualified  clinical  psychologist  or  psychiatrist  will\nassess  the. status  of  each  person  classified  as  maximum  security  at\nleast  once  each  30  days.  Said  assessment  will  include  a  personal\ninterview  with  the  inmate.\n18.  Visitation  by  religious  personnel  to  inmates  in  the  maximum\nsecurity  living  areas  will  be  governed  by  ttie  terms  of  the  visitation\nconsent  order  in  Duran  v.  Apodnca.

In  reviewing  the  appeal,  the\nHearing  Officer  will  consider  the  following  factors:\n1)  Compliance  with disciplinary  policies.\n2)  Was the  decision  of  the  Disciplinary  Committee  based  on\nsubstantial  evidence  and  facts?\n3)  Was  the  disciplinary  sanction  proportionate  to  the\noffense?\n4)  New evidence  or  witnesses.\n(e)  The  burden  of  proof  is on the inmate  to prove  the  contentions\nstated  in  his  notice  of  appeal.  Appeals  based  on  frivolous\ncontentions  (i.e.,  without  a  rational  claim  or  basis  in  fact\nor  policy)  will  be heard  only  on-the-record.\n(f)  If  an  appeal  is  to  be  considered  on-the-record,  the  Hearing\nOfficer  will  review  the  record  and  make a recommendation  as\nto  the  disposition  of  the  appeal  to  the  Secretary.\n\nPOLICY STATEMENT\nPage -28-\n(g)  If an appeal  is  to  be considered  de  novo,  the  Hearing  Officer\nwill  set  a  date  for  the  hearing.  The  witnesses  for  the\ninmate,  and  the  institution,  will  be  notified  of  the  date,\ntime  and  place  of  the  hearing.

Apodaca\nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nPC NM-001-010\nv. Civil  No.  77-0721-JB\nTONEY ANAYA, et al.,\nDefendants.\nENTERED ON DOCKET\nO R D ER\nIn 1978, the inmates of the Penitentiary of New Mexico\nbrought this civil action as a class action on behalf of all\npersons so confined/ challenging the conditions of their confine-\nment as violative of the United States Constitution.  In 1980, an\ninjunctive order in the form of a Consent Decree was entered,\ngranting wide-ranging relief to the plaintiff class in a variety\nof areas.  In its order approvinq and adopting the Consent Decree\nas an injunctive order, the Court noted that the action was a\n\"class action proceeding pursuant to Rule 23(b)(l.) and (2.) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"  Additionally, the Court\nredefined the plaintiff class to include \"all those inmates who\nare now, or in the future may be, incarcerated in the Pen'iten-\ntiary of New Mexico at Santa Fe or at any maximum, close, or\nmedium security facility open for operation by the State of New\nMexico after June 12, 1980.\"  The specific injunctive orders\n\napproved by the Court in its order of July 14/ 1980/ have\nremained  in effect without interruption at all times since that\norder.  On June 3/ 1983/ a Special Master was appointed by the\nCourt \"to monitor the state of the defendants' compliance with\nall remedial orders that have been entered or that may be entered\nin this cause.\"  Order of June 3/ p. 1.\nA judgment entered  in a class action certified pursuant to\nRule 23/ Fed. R. Civ. P. / is binding on all members of the\nclass, and bars subsequent collateral actions by members of the\nclass, provided  the requirements of class definition, notice and\nadequacy of representation are met.  Sam Fox Publishing Co. v.\nUnited States, 366 U.S. 683, 691  (1961.); Advisory Committee\nNotes, Proposed Rules of Civil Procedure, 39 F.R.D. 69, 105.  The\nfinality of class action judgments is fundamental to the policy\nundergirding class actions of facilitating  the unified determina-\ntion of numerous claims in one suit.  Garcia v. Board of Educa-\ntion, School District No. 1, 573 F.2d 676, 679 (10th Cir. 1978).\nThere has been no allegation, nor is there a colorable\nclaim, that the procedural requisites of Rule 23 relating to\ndefinition, notice or adequacy of representation have not been\nmet in this action.  The scope of the class affected by the\njudgment entered in this cause is plainly defined and is set\nforth in the order approving and adopting the Consent Decree, as\nrequired by Rule 23(c)(3).  Additionally, the third decretal\nparagraph of the Order of July 14, 1980, directed notice be given\nto all members of the plaintiff class and established a procedure\nfor class comment on the terms of the decree, as required by Rule\n\n23(e ).  Finally, the Court is satisfied  the plaintiff class\nr\nreceived adequate representation from counsel in the proceedings\nleading to entry of judgment.  Accordingly, a post-judgment\ncollateral action relating to issues covered by the judgment is\nimpermissible.  Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40-41 (1940,).\nThe foregoing discussion raises the question as to the\nprocedural mechanism by which members of the plaintiff class may\npresent to the Court allegations that they have been deprived of\nrights protected by the decree entered in this action.  The\nproper remedy for such noncompliance, available to individual\nmembers of the plaintiff class, is a motion, filed through\ncounsel for the Duran class, to show cause why defendants should\nnot be held in contempt of court for failure to comply with the\nCourt's injunctive order.  A motion of this kind would place such\nallegations in their proper posture for resolution.  In such a\nproceeding, the standard for defendants' conduct would be that\nset forth in the Court's decree and the factual issues would be\naddressed specifically to the question of defendants' compliance\nwith those provisions.\nAs noted previously, on June 3, 1983, the Court entered an\nOrder of Reference appointing a Special Master to assist the\nCourt in monitoring  the state of defendants' compliance with all\nremedial orders entered in this cause.  That order specifically\nprovides that \"[t]he duties of the Special Master shall be to\nobserve, monitor, find facts, report or testify as to his\nfindings, and make recommendations to the Court concerning steps\nthat should be taken to achieve compliance.\"  Order of June 3,\n\np. 1.  Among  the duties assigned by the Court to the Special\nMaster is the task of investigating  allegations of noncompliance\nto determine the factual basis of such allegations.  The Order of\nReference specifies the powers granted  to the Special Master to\nfacilitate  that process of factual investigation.  In view of\nthose prescribed powers/ the Office of the Special Master is the\nmost effective available means of resolving  the factual allega-\ntions of noncompliance.\nAccordingly/  the Court will forward  to the Office of the\nSpecial Master all documents filed by members of the plaintiff\nclass in this civil action seeking equitable relief pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for claims relating  to matters addressed  in the\nCourt's remedial orders in the cause.  The Special Master will be\ndirected  to take the action he deems appropriate under the Order\nof Reference with respect to factual investigation of the matters\nraised  therein.  As is made clear by the Order of Reference/\nhowever/ \"the sole power to direct compliance and to punish\nnoncompliance remains with [the] Court.\"  Order of June 3/ p. 3.\nVJheref ore /\nIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that all suits filed by\nmembers of the plaintiff class in the above-captioned  civil\naction/ seeking equitable relief for claims relating  to matters\naddressed  in the Court's remedial orders in this cause/ shall be\ndismissed.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court shall\nforward forthwith all documents filed by plaintiff(sj  in such\ncivil actions to the Office of the Special Master for appropriate\naction as described  herein.\nDATED this 15th day of March, 1984.\n...\n/Uf/ited S",

THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER MUST BE ISSUED TO\nPRESERVE THE STATUS QUO.\nDefendants, as described in the verified Memorandum, have already commenced the\ntransfer of class members in this litigation to Texas County Jail facilities.  Plaintiffs have\nraised serious questions regarding the continuing jurisdiction of the Court over class\nmembers shipped co Texas and new class members to be transferred to the PNM Main\nfacility.  In order to prevent Plaintiffs from facing a \"latches\" equitable defense and to\neffectuate the existing orders in this case, the Court should issue a temporary restraining\norder necessary to preserve the status quo.\n\"The purpose of a temporary restraining order is to preserve the status quo until\nthere is an opportunity to hold a hearing on an application for a preliminary injunction.\"\nFulton v. Citv of Sabeth. 1990 WL 192742 (D.Kan. 1990); Merrill Lynch. Pierce. Fenner\nand Smith. Inc. v. Dutton 844 F.2d, 726 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\nJS6  17:57  FROM  r-yiSH  THE DEATH PENALTY  TO  1505982030756  P.13/U\nIn order to prevent further damage to the compliance process at the PNM complex\nand with system-wide issues at all Quran facilities, the Court should preserve the status quo\nuntil it has an opportunity to rule on the merits of Plaintiffs' claims.\nII.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT IRREPARABLE HARM, TO  STOP\nONGOING VIOLATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS  AND\nTO EFFECTUATE THE COURT ORDERS ALREADY ISSUED  IN\nTHIS CASE, A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING  ORDER AND  A\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ARE NECESSARY TO  HALT\nTRANSFERS OF INMATES TO TEXAS AND TO  THE\nPENITENTIARY OF NEW MEXICO MAIN FACILITY.\nEquitable relief looks to the future - it is perspective in nature.  Judicial power does,\nnot cease when injunctive relief is entered or when a settlement between is approved by\nthe Court for that matter.  Court orders are to be obeyed and equity provides the means\nfor obtaining obedience.  Circumstances will change, but equity retains power to revise its\norders \"as events may shape the need.\"  U-S- v. SwJjft fe Compaq  286 U.S. 106.  As the\nCourt in Swift stated:\nInasmuch as an injunctive decree is drafted in light of what a\ncourt believes will be the future course of events, a court must\ncontinually be willing to redraft the order at the request of the\nparty who obtained equitable relief in order to ensure that the\ndecree accomplishes its intended result.  2S6 U.S. at 114.\n§£S also,  11 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure.  §2961 at 600, citing\nU.S. v. United Shoe Machinery Corporation. 391 U.S. 244 (1968).\nWhen conditions change in an ongoing equity action, the Court should modify a\ndecree so as to achieve the required result with all appropriate expedition.  United Shoe.\nsupra, at 252.  Thus, further relief is proper if the original purpose of the injunction is not\nbeing fulfilled in any material respect.  §&£, also. Crawford v. Janklow. 733 F.2d 5541 (8th\n\nP.13/11\n17:57  FROM  V ^_ISH THE DEPTH PENALTY TO\nr\nCir. 1984) (\"jurisdiction may extend beyond the initial injunction if necessary to assure\ncomplete relief\").\nAll of the Court's orders entered in the Modified Decree were intended to prevent\nserious harm and injury to class members rights. Plaintiffs have alleged ongoing violations\nof class members, especially in the area of legal access, which violations cannot be\ncompletely remedied through legal remedies.  More importantly, where constitutional\nrights are at risk no further showing of irreparable injury is ordinarily necessary.  See.\nGilmore v. Citv of Montgomery. Alabama. 417 U.S. 556 94 S.Ct. 2416 (1974); Allee v.\nMedrano. 416 U.S. 802; 94 S.Ct. 2191 (1974); Mitchell v. Cuomo. 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2nd\nCir. 1984); SSS. allS, 11 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure. 2948, at 440\n(1973) (\"When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, most courts hold\nthat no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary\")..\nIII.  PLAINTIFFS' LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS\nENTITLE THEM TO THE REQUESTED RELIEF.\nThe test for likelihood of success does not require certainty of success, only a\nreasonable probability that Plaintiffs will ultimately be entitle to the relief sought.\nCrowther v. Seaborg. 415 F-2d 437, 439 (10th Cir. 1969); Atcheson. Topeka 8e Santa Fe\nRv. Companv v. Leenen. 640 F.2d 255, 261 (10th Cir. 1981).  It will ordinarily be enough\nthat the Plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantially  difficult\nand doubtful as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberative\ninvestigation.  Continental Oil C^ompanv v. Frontier Refining Companv. 338 F.2d 780, 782\n(10th Cir. 1964).\n\n6  17 = 57  FROM  r,/f|_ISH THE DEATH HtNN_i r .u\nIV.  CONSIDERATIONS  OF INJURY TO THE PLAINTIFFS,  ANY\nPOSSIBLE INJURY TO THE DEFENDANTS AND THE PUBLIC\nINTEREST ALL MILITATE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF  GRANTING\nTHE INJUNCTION.\nIn Crowther v. Seaborg. supra, the 10th Circuit established a test for granting a\npreliminary injunction that includes a balancing of the threatened harm to a plaintiff\nagainst whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party.  In this\ncase, the relief requested to preserve the status quo presents virtually no risk of damage to\nthe Defendants.  The Defendants have transferred approximately 200 hundred inmates to\nTexas.  They plan to ship approximately 50 inmates per week out of the plaintiff class into\nTexas County Jails over the next five or six weeks.  Preserving the status quo through\nhalting the transfers of inmates for the next few weeks while this matter is resolved on the\nmerits, while possibly an inconvenience, presents no risk of harm to the Defendants.  At\nthe same time, it is extremely important to Plaintif£s,given the probable injuries to their\nrights as provided under the Modified Decree, the likelihood of harm to be suffered if those\nprotections are stripped from them and the interference with the orderly compliance\nprocess which was taking place until Defendants chose to shift class members to Texas, that\nrelief be granted immediately.\nIssuing the requested injunctions will in no way be adverse to the public interest.\nIn fact, legislative and public sentiment has been strongly against the completed and\nproposed transfers.  At a hearing on this matter, it is anticipated that the testimony from\nthe Defendants, themselves, as well as from legislative representatives or employees will\nshow that both the House and Senate of the State of New Mexico have indicated they are\nwilling to take all steps necessary to stop such transfers.  At the same time, it is clearly in\n4\n\n:58  FROM  POLISH  THE DEATH PENALTY  TO  ^1505982030756  P. 16/11\n17\nthe public interest to reverse the Defendants' plan of action to see that compliance with the\nCourt's Modified Decree is expedited, that the wind-down process and ultimate vacation of\nthis Court's jurisdiction is completed and that the State of New Mexico and its\nrepresentative defendants no longer engage in violations of federal law.\nV.  CONCLUSION\nFor all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to grant the\ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction as described herein and not to\nrequire Plaintiffs to post any bond or other security for the granting of such injunaion.\nRespectfully submitted,\nROTHSTEIN, DONATELU,  HUGHES,\nDAHLSTROM, CRON & SCHOENBURG\nBy;\nMark H.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n3.  The  first  claim  for  relief  is filed under  42 U.S.C.\n[Filed July 6, 1978] sec. 1983 to redress injuries suffered  by Plaintiffs  and the\nclass they represent  for  deprivation  under  color  of  state\nlaw of rights secured  by the First,  Sixth, Eighth,  Ninth,\nand Fourteenth amendments.

Plantiff's  first,  second,  third  and fourth  claims  for\nrelief  are derived from  common nuclei of operative  facts\n1.  This  amended  complaint  is  a  class  action  brought\ninvolving  substantially  identical  issues  of  fact  and  law,\nby Plaintiffs on behalf  of all prisoners who are presently,\nsuch that the entire action constitutes a single case which\nor will  be, confined  in  the Penitentiary  of  New  Mexico\nwould  ordinarily  be  judicial  economy,  convenience  and\n(hereinafter  referred  to  as \"PNM\").

The Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter in this case. \n2.  This is a class action originally brought in 1977 alleging violations of the federal constitutional \nrights of certain inmates in the State of New Mexico’s custody.  By the parties’ agreement, the \nCourt entered an order on July 15, 1980, noting that the Plaintiff class had been certified under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (2), and redefining the class as: \n \n1 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73, the parties have consented to the undersigned \nUnited States Magistrate Judge to conduct any and all proceedings (including a jury or nonjury trial) and to enter a \nfinal judgment in this matter.  (Docs. 3089, 3090.)  \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 2 of 28\n  all those inmates who are now, or in the future may be, incarcerated in the \nPenitentiary of New Mexico at Santa Fe or at any maximum, close, or \nmedium security facility open for operation by the State of New Mexico \nafter June 12, 1980.2 \n \n(Doc. 101 at 1; Doc. 405 at 1.) \n3.  After extensive litigation, on June 10, 1991, the parties entered into a settlement agreement \nresolving all then-pending motions. (Doc. 2851-3.)  The Court issued an order (“1991 Consent \nDecree”) adopting the parties’ agreement on September 20, 1991. (Doc. 1748.)  By July 16, \n1999, all of the substantive requirements in the 1991 Consent Decree had been satisfied and \nvacated, except for certain restrictions on overcrowding.  (Doc. 2851-1 at 3-4.)  According to \nthe decree, these overcrowding restrictions were to remain in place in perpetuity.  (Doc. 2851-\n3 at 7, 19.) \n4.  The litigation was dormant from late 1999 to late 2015, when a class member revived it by \nfiling pro se motions for an emergency injunction and a contempt order.  (Docs. 2692, 2694.)  \nClass counsel resumed active representation of the Plaintiff class, and on August 5, 2016, with \nthe assistance of then-United States Chief Magistrate Judge Karen B. Molzen, the parties \nreached a settlement of the then pending disputes.  (Doc. 2764.)  The Court approved this \nsettlement on August 31, 2016.  (Doc. 2769.) \n5.  Almost a year later, on July 5, 2017, class counsel filed Plaintiffs’ Motion for Declaratory, \nInjunctive, and Remedial Relief regarding Violations of the Court’s Stipulated Orders, alleging \nthat Defendants were violating the 1991 Consent Decree and the parties’ 2016 settlement \nagreement.  (Doc. 2837.)  That motion remains pending, as do two additional motions for \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and remedial relief that class counsel later filed.  (Docs. 2928, 2929.)  \n \n2 The class had previously been certified as “all inmates who are now or in the future may be incarcerated at the \nPenitentiary of New Mexico at Santa Fe.”  (Doc. 33 at 3; Doc. 101 at 1.) \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 3 of 28\nThe Plaintiff class has alleged ongoing violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution, including unreasonable risks to class members’ health and \nsafety  due  to  overcrowding,  violence,  misclassification,  disproportionate  discipline, \nunderstaffing, environmental conditions including vermin and constitutionally inadequate \nbathroom facilities and plumbing, constitutionally inadequate healthcare, and failure to timely \nrelease inmates at prison facilities operated by the New Mexico Corrections Department \n(“NMCD”).  (Doc. 3009 at 4-10.) \n6.  Defendants opposed Plaintiffs’ motions.  (Docs. 2851, 2976, 2977.)  They also filed motions \nto dismiss seeking termination of all prospective relief and an automatic stay on December 5, \n2018.  (Docs. 3003, 3004.)  However, Defendants subsequently withdrew these motions \nwithout prejudice to allow the parties to pursue settlement negotiations.  (Doc. 3023.)  The \nparties  have  conducted  extensive  investigation  and  discovery  regarding  the  claims  and \ndefenses raised in their respective motions. \n7.  The parties participated in a settlement conference with United States Magistrate Judge Steven \nC. Yarbrough on February 25, 2019, March 29, 2019, and April 30, 2019.  (Docs. 3029, 3034, \n3040.)  At a status conference on May 3, 2019, counsel advised the Court that the parties had \nreached a settlement in principle.  (Doc. 3044.)  \n8.  On June 3, 2019, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement \nAgreement.  (Doc. 3047.)  In the motion, the parties sought the Court’s preliminary approval \nof a settlement agreement signed on May 14, 2019.  (Id. at 1; see Doc. 3047-1.)  The Court \nheld a hearing on the motion on June 11, 2019, after which the parties conferred and clarified \nlanguage in the agreement.  (Docs. 3055, 3067.) \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 4 of 28\n9.  The parties incorporated their clarifications into a Revised Settlement Agreement, which they \nexecuted on August 14, 2019.  (Doc. 3067-1.)  The parties then filed a second Joint Motion for \nPreliminary Approval of Settlement Agreement on August 21, 2019.  (Doc. 3067.)  In their \nAugust 21, 2019 motion, the parties sought the Court’s preliminary approval of the Revised \nSettlement Agreement and represented that the revised agreement was “the operative version \nof the Settlement Agreement and . . . supersedes the May 14, 2019 version of the Agreement.”3  \n(Id. at 1.)  The parties attached the Revised Settlement Agreement and a proposed Notice to \nPlaintiff Class Members to their August 21, 2019 motion.  (Docs. 3067-1, 3067-2.) \n10. On August 28, 2019, the Court held a hearing on the parties’ August 21, 2019 motion.  (Docs. \n3070, 3073.)  At the hearing, counsel and NMCD Cabinet Secretary Alisha Tafoya Lucero \nmade presentations and responded to the Court’s questions regarding the parties’ agreement.  \n(Id.) \n11. The Court entered an Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement \nAgreement, and Approving and Directing the Issuance of Notice to Plaintiff Class Members \n(“Order Granting Preliminary Approval”) on September 5, 2019.  (Doc. 3072.)  In its Order \nGranting Preliminary Approval, the Court preliminarily held that the Revised Settlement \nAgreement was fair, adequate, reasonable, and likely to meet the requirements of Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23(e) and the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3626.  \n(Id. at 8.) \n12. The Court also approved the Notice to Plaintiff Class Members (“Notice”) attached to the \nOrder Granting Preliminary Approval and found that it satisfied the requirements of Rule 23 \nand due process.  (Id.; see Doc. 3072-2.)  The Court directed Defendants to provide the Notice \n \n3 In light of the parties’ August 21, 2019 motion, the Court denied their June 3, 2019 motion as moot.  (Doc. 3068.) \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 5 of 28\nand Revised Settlement Agreement to class members by posting them in English and Spanish \nin the law library, general library, dining facilities, recreational facilities, and on a bulletin \nboard in every unit in every NMCD facility in New Mexico, from September 24, 2019 through \nDecember 23, 2019.  (Doc. 3072 at 8-9.)  The Court further directed Defendants to provide the \nNotice and Revised Settlement Agreement to each inmate housed in any segregated housing \nunit between September 24, 2019 and December 23, 2019, in English or Spanish at the inmate’s \nelection.  (Id. at 9.)  \n13. Defendants provided notice of the proposed settlement to the Plaintiff class as the Court \ndirected, including at covered NMCD facilities operated by private contractors.  (Docs. 3195, \n3198.)    Defendants  monitored  whether  the  Notice  and  Revised  Settlement  Agreement \nremained posted as prescribed during the objection period and, when inmates at the Guadalupe \nCounty  Correctional  Facility  (“GCCF”)  removed  some  posted  copies,  replaced  them \nreasonably promptly.  (Id.)  In fact, Defendants went beyond the Court’s requirements to ensure \nthat all class members at GCCF received notice of the proposed settlement, posting extra copies \nof the Notice and Revised Settlement Agreement in the required locations and placing these \ndocuments on an “inmate television systems information channel.”  (Id.) \n14. In its Order Granting Preliminary Approval, the Court directed any class member who wished \nto object to the Revised Settlement Agreement to file his or her objections in writing by \nDecember 23, 2019 and directed Defendants to allow class members to submit timely \nobjections free of charge.  (Doc. 3072 at 9.) \n15. Between September 12, 2019 and January 27, 2020, approximately 152 members of the \nPlaintiff class filed objections to the Revised Settlement Agreement.4  (See Docs. 3075, 3077-\n \n4 Calculating the exact number of objectors is not the simple exercise it would appear to be at first glance.  For example, \none class member purported to file objections on behalf of himself and the other 71 inmates in his dormitory.  (Doc. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 6 of 28\n84, 3091, 3096, 3098, 3100-01, 3106-14, 3116, 3118-32, 3142-44, 3146-57, 3159-64, 3169-\n70, 3175-77; see also Docs. 3093-95, 3097, 3099, 3102-03, 3105, 3133-41, 3158, 3165-68.)  \nThe Court has meticulously reviewed all of these objections and has considered them carefully \nin deciding whether to approve the proposed settlement.5 \n16. The Court has also carefully reviewed and considered the objections that seven class members \nsent to class counsel between September 24, 2019 and December 23, 2019 and later directed \ncounsel to file.  (Doc. 3199.)  Counsel filed these objections on February 10, 2020, but the \nCourt deems them timely because they were sent to class counsel within the prescribed \nobjection period.  (See id.) \n17. The objections to the proposed settlement take issue with:  (a)  the loss of the provision \nproviding that certain overcrowding restrictions in the 1991 Consent Decree would remain in \nplace in perpetuity; (b) the reduction of the required dimensions for dormitories and multiple \noccupancy cells from 60 to 50 square feet per inmate; (c) the reduction in total good time \nawarded for completion of the Residential Drug Abuse Program (“RDAP”); (d) the exclusion \nof some class members from the award of good time as remedial relief and the adequacy of \n \n3157 at 1.)  All of these class members are included in the Court’s calculation of the total number of objectors.  \nLikewise included are the 19 class members who raised objections in their Motions to Stay and Terminate and the one \nclass member who raised objections in his Motion for Extension of Time to File Objections to Settle[ment] Agreement.  \n(See Docs. 3093-95, 3097, 3099, 3102-03, 3105, 3133-41, 3158, 3165-68.)  Not included, however, are two class \nmembers who filed pleadings styled as objections expressing unreserved support for the proposed settlement.  (Docs. \n3109-10.)  Also, the Court tried to avoid double-counting those class members who filed objections more than once, \nas well as those who filed separate objections and memoranda of law in support of their objections.  (See, e.g., Docs. \n3075 and 3100 (filed by S. Jacobs); Docs. 3091 and 3101 (filed by P. Cain); Docs. 3102 and 3139 (filed by J. Kame); \nDocs. 3127 and 3128 (filed by C. Buccigrossi); Docs. 3129 and 3130 (filed by M. Whitehead); Docs. 3131 and 3132 \n(filed by R. Tucker).)  Nevertheless, some objectors may have been counted twice.   \n \n5 The Court has also reviewed one unsigned and twelve signed objections to the parties’ original Settlement Agreement \n(Doc. 3047-1), which class members filed before the Court entered its Order Granting Preliminary Approval of the \nproposed settlement.  (See Docs. 3058, 3063, 3065-66.)  In deciding whether to grant final approval of the proposed \nsettlement, the Court has considered these objections insofar as they address provisions found in the Revised \nSettlement Agreement and Second Revised Settlement Agreement as well as the original Settlement Agreement.  (See \nDoc. 3200-1 at 1.)  In addition, the Court has reviewed and considered the objections of former class member Calupp \nHenderson.  (Doc. 3104.) \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 7 of 28\nthis relief; (e) the proposed population reduction at the Otero County Prison Facility (“OCPF”), \nwhich objectors contend will not alleviate overcrowding at that facility; and, (f) class counsel’s \nalleged collusion with Defendants’ counsel in reaching the proposed settlement.  (Doc. 3174 \nat 12.)  In addition, there were several miscellaneous objections, including complaints about:  \nthe absence of photographic evidence of class members’ living and sleeping space; lack of \nnatural light; unregulated temperatures in the pods; absence of hooks for uniforms in cells; \nclaimed medical injuries resulting from overcrowding; phone-to-inmate ratio; quality of the \nfood;  family  visitation;  availability  and  implementation  of  educational  programs;  mail \nservices; absence of monetary compensation to class members; access to medical services and \nmedical staff; staff behavior towards inmates; potential reduction of staff physical fitness \nstandards; violations of the American with Disabilities Act for geriatric inmates; exclusion of \nserious violent offenders from eligibility for parole reduction recommendations; and, excessive \nwait times for the parole of sex offenders. \n18. The parties filed a Joint Memorandum in Support of Final Court Approval of the Revised \nSettlement Agreement (Doc. 3174) on January 22, 2020, and the Parties’ Joint Motion for \nFinal Approval of Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. 3184) on January 30, 2020. \n19. On January 31, 2020, the parties filed a Joint Motion and Memorandum of Law for Approval \nof a Modification to Paragraph 12 of the Revised Settlement Agreement.  (Doc. 3186.)  In this \nmotion the parties indicated that, after the Court entered its Order Granting Preliminary \nApproval, they agreed to modify Paragraph 12 of the Revised Settlement Agreement to state: \n  The Classification Supervisor will ensure that the Parole Board Docket \nForm is accurate and that it, along with the Parole Plan, is submitted to the \nAdult Parole Board (“Board”) via e-mail no later than 30 days prior to a \nclass member’s hearing date 90 days prior to a class member’s projected \nrelease date for class members that will serve parole in New Mexico and no \nlater than 120 days prior to the class member’s projected release date if the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 8 of 28\nclass member will serve parole out of state. NMCD will ensure that class \nmembers are timely released on their certified release date following receipt \nof parole board certificate and, where applicable, when there is available \nspace at a halfway house, transitional living center, or long-term residential \ntreatment center. Substantial compliance with this provision means that \nNMCD complies with the provisions of this section at least 85% of the time. \nBeginning no later than thirty days after the entry of this Court’s final \napproval  order,  NMCD  will  provide  Plaintiffs’  counsel  with  monthly \nreports documenting production of the Parole Board Docket Form, Parole \nPlan, and release date for all class members.6 \n \n(Id. at 2; see also Doc. 3200-2 at 9.)  According to the parties, after the Court preliminarily \napproved the Revised Settlement Agreement, they learned that an inmate’s parole hearing is \nnot scheduled until after NMCD submits the Parole Board Docket Form and Parole Plan to \nthe Parole Board.  (Doc. 3186 at 2-4.)  As such, the parties realized, it would be meaningless \nto require NMCD to submit the Parole Board Docket Form and Parole Plan 30 days before \nthe inmate’s hearing date.  (Id.)  The change to which the parties agreed remedies this problem \nby using the inmate’s projected release date, rather than a non-existent hearing date, to \ndetermine when NMCD must submit the Parole Board Docket Form and Parole Plan to the \nParole Board.  (Id.)  The purpose of the change is to realize the parties’ intent to ensure that \nparole planning for class members begins well in advance of their projected release dates, \nthereby reducing the number of class members serving in-house parole.  (Id.) \n20. Rule 23 does not specifically address whether a new notice to class members and a new \nobjection  period  are  required  when  parties  agree  to  modify  a  class  action  settlement \nagreement. See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  “Material alterations to a class settlement \ngenerally require a new round of notice to the class and a new Rule 23(e) hearing.”  Pearson \nv. Target Corp., 893 F.3d 980, 986 (7th Cir. 2018).  However, courts have generally found \n \n6 Throughout this Order, language that the parties have agreed to delete from the Revised Settlement Agreement is \nmarked as stricken, and language that they have agreed to add is underlined and italicized. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 9 of 28\nthat a second notice and objection period is not required if the agreed-upon modifications \nmerely expand the rights of the class. For example, in In re Integra Realty Resources, Inc., \n262 F.3d 1089 (10th Cir. 2001), the Tenth Circuit agreed that a modification allowing class \nmembers to opt out of a class action settlement did not require a second notice to class \nmembers, stating: \n  the addition of opt-out rights merely expanded the rights of class members \n. . . . Therefore, we see no way that the court's failure to provide new notice \nof the opt-out rights prior to accepting the settlement gave rise to a risk that \nunfavorable terms would be forced upon some class members or otherwise \ndiminished class members' ability to bring objections before the court. \nAccordingly, we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing \nto notify class members of their opt-out rights prior to conducting a fairness \nhearing of the settlement's terms. \n \nId. at 1111.  Similarly, in In re Diet Drugs (Phentermine/Fenfluramine/Dexfenfluramine) \nProducts Liability Litigation, 763 F. App'x 237 (3d Cir. 2019), the Third Circuit affirmed the \ndistrict court’s ruling that “supplemental, classwide notice of an amendment to a settlement \nagreement is required only where the amendment has a material adverse effect on the rights \nof class members.”  Id. at 241-42 (quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., In re Anthem, Inc. \nData Breach Litig., 327 F.R.D. 299, 330 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (“[W]hen the modification makes \nthe settlement more valuable to the class, courts have routinely concluded that notice is \nunnecessary.”) (citing cases); Keepseagle v. Vilsack, 102 F. Supp. 3d 306, 313 (D.D.C. 2015) \n(“[A]n amendment [to a class action settlement agreement] requires supplemental notice only \nwhen it would have a material adverse effect on the rights of class members.”) (quotation \nmarks omitted); Harris v. Graddick, 615 F. Supp. 239, 244 (M.D. Ala.1985) (“Under these \nlimited circumstances where the amendment is narrow and it is clearly apparent that the \ninterests of the classes are not substantially impaired, the court is of the opinion that the notice \nalready given is adequate and that additional notice is not required pursuant to Rule 23(e).”). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 10 of 28\n21. The Court has carefully reviewed the parties’ Joint Motion and Memorandum of Law for \nApproval of a Modification to Paragraph 12 of the Revised Settlement Agreement, including \nthe attached Affidavit of Hope Salazar (Doc. 3186), as well as the Declaration of Cisco \nMcSorley[,] Executive Director of the New Mexico Parole Board.  (Doc. 3187.)  The Court, \nhaving considered these documents and the parties’ responses to the Court’s inquiries at a \nhearing held on February 3, 2020, (Doc. 3195), and being otherwise fully advised in the \npremises, finds that the limited modification to Paragraph 12 to which the parties have agreed \nmerely expands the rights of the members of the Plaintiff class and in no way impairs their \ninterests.  In particular, the Court is persuaded that the earlier parole planning the modification \nis intended to secure will not delay class members’ timely release upon completion of their \nsentences and will in fact provide more time for the parties to address problems that could \notherwise prevent class members from being paroled on schedule.  The Court therefore finds \nthat the modification to Paragraph 12 does not necessitate a new notice and objection period \nbefore the Court may finally approve the parties’ proposed settlement. \n22. On February 3, 2020, four attorneys for the Plaintiff class filed declarations regarding their \nwork on this case.7  (Docs. 3190-92, 3194.)  These declarations describe class counsel’s \nsustained, extensive contacts with members of the Plaintiff class before, during, and after the \nnegotiations resulting in the proposed settlement.  These contacts include:  (a) meetings with \nclass members during twenty-one (21) tours of covered NMCD facilities (including at least \none tour of each such facility); (b) “hundreds of phone calls with” class members; (c) \n \n7 The attorneys who filed declarations are Alexandra Freedman Smith, Philip Davis, Katherine Loewe, and Mark \nDonatelli.  (Docs. 3190-92, 3194.)  Mr. Davis and Mr. Donatelli have represented the Plaintiff class since before the \n1991 settlement agreement, and Mr. Donatelli participated in the negotiations that led to the 1991 agreement and \nsigned it.  (Doc. 3191 at 1; Doc. 3194 at 1.)  Further, attorney Peter Cubra, who participated in the negotiations leading \nto the proposed settlement and consulted with and advised class members before, during, and after these negotiations, \nhas also represented the Plaintiff class since before the 1991 settlement agreement, and participated in the negotiations \nthat led to that agreement.  (See Doc. 2851-3 at 20.) \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 11 of 28\n“hundreds of letters” from class members; and, (d) “hundreds of letters” to them.  (Doc. 3190 \nat 2-4; Doc. 3191 at 1-3; Doc. 3192 at 2-6; Doc. 3194 at 2.)  For example, during the \nnegotiations resulting in the Revised Settlement Agreement, counsel  \n  spoke with dozens of inmates on telephone calls regarding the conditions . \n. . in which they were living and sent out hundreds of letters to clients asking \nfor information about the conditions in the prisons and what they were most \nconcerned about.  Clients sent us approximately 100 letters explaining the \nissues they were experiencing.  We also engaged in phone calls where they \ntold us their concerns. \n \n(Doc. 3190 at 4; Doc. 3192 at 3.)  In this manner, counsel identified the problems class \nmembers were seeking to remedy and “used this information to formulate the settlement \ndemands” they made.  (Doc. 3190 at 4-5; Doc. 3192 at 3-4.)  “The relief [class counsel] \nobtained was directly informed by what [class members] had told [them].”  (Doc. 3190 at 5; \nDoc. 3192 at 5; Doc. 3194 at 3-4.)  Class counsel also received letters from and spoke with \n“numerous class members” regarding the Revised Settlement Agreement during the objection \nperiod.  (Doc. 3190 at 6; Doc. 3192 at 5-6.)  Many class members expressed their approval of \nthe proposed settlement, and “the sentiment of the hundreds of class members with whom \n[class  counsel]  met”  at  the  OCPF  and  Southern  New  Mexico  Correctional  Facility \n(“SNMCF”) “was overwhelmingly favorable to the [Revised Settlement Agreement].”8  (Doc. \n3190 at 6; Doc. 3191 at 3.)  \n23. The pleadings filed by class members Alison Comstock and Ronaele Sanchez corroborate \ncounsel’s declarations, stating that:  (a) class members “collab[o]rated together to state [their] \ndisagree[ment] with the way [they] were housed”; (b) the litigation was a “team effort”; and, \n(c) Ms. Comstock and Ms. Sanchez “completely agree” with the terms of the proposed \n \n8 This is particularly significant because, as counsel noted, the majority of class members who objected to the proposed \nsettlement were housed at OCPF, SNMCF, and Northeast New Mexico Correctional Facility.  (Doc. 3190 at 6.) \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 12 of 28\nsettlement.  (Docs. 3109, 3110.)  Also, during a tour of Springer Correctional Center (“SCC”) \nwith counsel for both sides in April 2018, the undersigned observed some of class counsel’s \ncommunications with numerous class members, the substance of which clearly evinced \nongoing and extensive contacts.  (See Doc. 2923.) \n24. The Court held a hearing on the parties’ Joint Memorandum in Support of Final Court \nApproval of the Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. 3174) and Parties’ Joint Motion for \nFinal Approval of Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. 3184) on February 3, 2020.  (Doc. \n3195.)    At  this  hearing,  counsel  and  Secretary Tafoya Lucero made presentations and \nresponded to the Court’s questions regarding the proposed settlement. \n25. At the hearing, the parties agreed to modify the Revised Settlement Agreement in two \nrespects.  First, the parties agreed that Paragraph 1(d)(ii)(3) should state: \n  No more than five prisoners per dayroom shall be assigned to dayrooms in \nany facility and the dayroom housing must provide a minimum of 50 square \nfeet of combined living and sleeping space per inmate (excluding the cell \nleft open for hygiene, as set forth below). \n \n(Doc. 3200-2 at 6.)  The purpose of this modification is not to change the meaning of \nParagraph 1(d)(ii)(3), but rather to eliminate an unintended ambiguity to which some class \nmembers objected.  (See, e.g., Doc. 3129 at 4-5; Doc. 3131 at 4-5.)  On its face, this minor \nmodification merely expands the rights of the Plaintiff class and in no way impairs its \ninterests.  The Court therefore finds that the modification to Paragraph 1(d)(ii)(3) does not \nnecessitate a new notice and objection period before the Court may finally approve the \nproposed settlement.

Second, the parties agreed that, in addition to eligible inmates at Northwest New Mexico \nCorrectional Facility (“NWNMCF”), SCC, and Western New Mexico Correctional Facility \n(“WNMCF”), eligible inmates at OCPF should receive the remedial relief provided for in \nParagraph 17 of the parties’ agreement.9  (Doc. 3200-2 at 11.)  Specifically, the parties agreed \nto modify Paragraph 17 as follows:   \n  As remedial relief, NMCD agrees to award one month’s worth of good time \nconsistent with NMSA 1978, § 33-2-34(A) (2015) to the following inmates: \n(1) any inmate who was housed for at least 60 days in dormitories at \nNWNMCF  from  March  1,  2014  until  the  date  the  Court  finds  that \nDefendants are in substantial compliance with subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this \nRevised Settlement Agreement; (2) any inmate who was housed for at least \n60 days at SCC from October 1, 2016 until the date the Court finds that \nDefendants are in substantial compliance with subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of \nthis Revised Settlement Agreement; and (3) any inmate housed for at least \n60 days in dormitories at WNMCF from October 1, 2016 until the date the \nCourt finds Defendants are in substantial compliance with subparagraph \n(1)(b)(iii) of this Revised Settlement Agreement; and (4) any inmate housed \nfor at least 60 days in dormitories at OCPF from October 1, 2016 until the \ndate  the  Court  finds  Defendants  are  in  substantial  compliance  with \nsubparagraph (1)(b)(iv) of this Revised Settlement Agreement.10 Only one \naward will be made to eligible inmates. Excluded from this provision are \nany inmates who have a sustained finding of assault against a staff member. \nAlso excluded from this provision are those inmates who have less than 45 \ndays of time left to serve on their sentence as measured from the entry of \nthis Court’s final approval order. These good time awards shall be made \nwithin 30 days of this Court’s final approval order. For inmates who become \neligible for these good time awards after the date of the final approval order, \nthe awards shall be made within 30 days of the date the inmate becomes \neligible. \n \n(Id.)  Many OCPF inmates objected to the Revised Settlement Agreement because it excluded \nthem from receiving this remedial relief.  (See, e.g., Docs. 3199-1 to 3199-3.)  The parties’ \nagreement to modify Paragraph 17 addresses these objectors’ concerns.  The modification \n \n9 The purpose of Paragraph 17 is to provide remedial relief to class members who have endured unconstitutional \nconditions while residing in overcrowded dormitories during the specified time frames.  (See Doc. 3200 at 3-6.) \n \n10 At the February 3, 2020 hearing, the parties clarified that “60 days” as used in Paragraph 17 means 60 days total, \nrather than 60 consecutive days. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 14 of 28\nconfers a benefit that the proposed settlement previously lacked, and as such operates solely \nto expand the rights of the Plaintiff class.  The Court therefore finds that the modification to \nParagraph 17 does not necessitate a new notice and objection period before the Court may \nfinally approve the proposed settlement.  In re Integra Realty Res., Inc., 262 F.3d at 1111; In \nre Diet Drugs (Phentermine/Fenfluramine/Dexfenfluramine) Prods. Liab. Litig., 763 F. App'x \nat 241-42; In re Anthem, Inc. Data Breach Litig., 327 F.R.D. at 330; Keepseagle, 102 F. Supp. \n3d at 313; Harris, 615 F. Supp. at 244. \n27. At the February 3, 2020 hearing, the Court took the Parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval \nof Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. 3184) and Joint Motion and Memorandum of Law \nfor Approval of a Modification to Paragraph 12 of the Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. \n3186) under advisement pending the filing of a superseding joint motion requesting final \napproval  of  the  Revised  Settlement  Agreement  with  the  agreed-upon  modifications  to \nParagraphs 1(d)(ii)(3), 12, and 17.  \n28. The parties filed their Joint Motion for Final Approval of the Second Revised Settlement \nAgreement on February 10, 2020.  (Doc. 3200.)  In this motion, the parties jointly ask the \nCourt  to  finally  approve  the  parties’  Second  Revised  Settlement  Agreement,  which \nincorporates the modifications to Paragraphs 1(d)(ii)(3), 12, and 17 described above.11  (See \ngenerally id.) \n \n11 The Second Revised Settlement Agreement also includes the following modified introductory language:   \n \n  The parties have incorporated those clarifications into this a Revised Settlement Agreement and \nthey, through their undersigned counsel, executed this the Revised Settlement Agreement on August \n14, 2019. Following the Court’s preliminary approval of the Revised Settlement Agreement on \nSeptember 5, 2019, the parties agreed to certain modifications to the Revised Settlement Agreement, \nwhich have been incorporated into this Second Revised Settlement Agreement. This Second Revised \nSettlement Agreement (referred to herein as the “Revised Settlement Agreement”) is now the \noperative version of the Settlement Agreement and it supersedes the May 14, 2019, and August 14, \n2019, versions of the Agreement. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 15 of 28\n29. The Court finds that the Second Revised Settlement Agreement should be finally approved \nunder the standards set forth in Rule 23(e) and the PLRA, and makes the following findings in \nthis regard: \na)  The Plaintiff class is composed of all men confined to a medium or higher custody \nfacility and all women of any classification level in the New Mexico Corrections \nDepartment’s custody.  (Doc. 3072 at 8 ¶ A; Doc. 3174 at 9 ¶ 1; Doc. 3200-1 at 10 \n¶ 14.)  Although the language used to identify the Plaintiff class has been clarified, \nthe composition of the class is the same as it was when the Court entered the 1991 \nConsent Decree in September 1991.  As previously noted, by September 1991, the \nclass was defined as “all those inmates who are now, or in the future may be, \nincarcerated in the Penitentiary of New Mexico at Santa Fe or at any maximum, \nclose, or medium security facility open for operation by the State of New Mexico \nafter June 12, 1980.”  (Doc. 101 at 1; Doc. 405 at 1.)  At that time, all female \ninmates in NMCD’s custody, regardless of classification level, were housed at the \nNew Mexico Women’s Correctional Facility, a “maximum, close, or medium \nsecurity facility open for operation by the State of New Mexico after June 12, \n1980.”  (Id.; Doc. 2837 at 17; Doc. 2851 at 10.)  Thus, then as now, all female \ninmates in NMCD’s custody, regardless of classification level, are class members.12 \n \n(Doc. 3200-2 at 1.)  These changes simply reflect the most recent procedural history of the proposed settlement and \ndo not alter class members’ rights in any way.  As such, they do not necessitate a new notice and objection period. \n \n12 At the February 3, 2020 hearing, the parties confirmed that the Plaintiff class has never included, and does not now \nand is not intended to include, women who are on parole or in community corrections outpatient programs, though \nthese women are technically still in NMCD’s custody.   \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 16 of 28\nb)  As of February 14, 2020, there are 6,822 inmates in NMCD’s custody, most of \nwhom are members of the Plaintiff class.  https://cd.nm.gov/ (last visited Feb. 14. \n2020); (Doc. 3195).   \nc)  The settlement is “a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise” of \n“[t]he claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class,” and as such is subject to the \nrequirements of Rule 23(e).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). \nd)  As required by Rule 23(e)(1), the Notice and the notice procedure outlined therein \nwere reasonably calculated to inform all class members of the pendency of the \naction and the terms of the proposed settlement, and to afford them an opportunity \nto object to the proposed settlement.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1); Fager v. CenturyLink \nCommc'ns, LLC, 854 F.3d 1167, 1171 (10th Cir. 2016); DeJulius v. New England \nHealth Care Employees Pension Fund, 429 F.3d 935, 944 (10th Cir. 2005).  Both \nas  prescribed  and  as  actually  implemented,  the  Notice  and  notice  procedure \nconstituted the best notice practicable under the circumstances. \ne)  Rule 23(e)(2)(A) requires the Court to consider whether “the class representatives \nand  class  counsel  have  adequately  represented  the  class.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n23(e)(2)(A).  The named class representatives in this case have either died or failed \nto remain in contact with class counsel.  However, class counsel have ensured that \ncounsel’s  contact  information  is  available  to  all  class  members  and  have \ncommunicated directly with hundreds regarding class members’ positions and \nconcerns with respect to this case before, during, and after the negotiations resulting \nin the proposed settlement, by letter and telephone and during multiple visits to \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 17 of 28\ncovered facilities.13  Class counsel fully advised class members of their efforts to \naddress class members’ concerns and undertook settlement negotiations with the \nauthority of the majority of the class members with whom they have spoken over \nthe last several years.  Despite ample notice to class members and class members’ \nability to object free of charge, only about 2.5 % of inmates in NMCD custody \nobjected to the proposed settlement.14  Class counsel confirmed on the record in \nopen court that most of the class members with whom they have communicated \nhave approved of the proposed settlement.  Thus, in the parties’ judgment, the \nsettlement is fair and reasonable.  Jones v. Nuclear Pharmacy, Inc., 741 F.2d 322, \n324 (10th Cir. 1984).  Further, class counsel had the authority to negotiate and agree \nto the Second Revised Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Plaintiff class, and \nthe  class  members  with  whom  counsel  have  communicated  have  adequately \nrepresented the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(A). \nf)  Class counsel have also adequately represented the Plaintiff class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(e)(2)(A).  Broadly, they have pursued class interests zealously, conscientiously, \nand consistently for a very long time.  Specifically with respect to the proposed \nsettlement, they have negotiated access to and toured covered facilities, conducted \nindependent investigations (including taking their own measurements of class \nmembers’  living  and  sleeping  spaces),  taken  discovery,  engaged  in  motions \n \n13 The Court notes that Reilly Johnson, one of the many class members with whom class counsel communicated, was \na member of an inmate committee during the negotiations leading to the 1991 Consent Decree.  According to class \ncounsel, Mr. Johnson expressed his understanding and approval of the Revised Settlement Agreement. \n \n14 This percentage assumes 172 objectors out of 6,822 inmates.  The Court arrived at 172 objectors by adding the 13 \nclass members who filed objections before the prescribed objection period, the 152 class members who filed objections \nduring the prescribed objection period, and the seven class members whose objections counsel filed on February 10, \n2020. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 18 of 28\npractice, and participated in extensive, arms-length settlement negotiations.  Class \ncounsel have demonstrated steadfast devotion to the best interests of the class \nmembers. As a result of their efforts and their considerable knowledge, skill, \nresources, and experience, class counsel have obtained a favorable settlement \nagreement for the Plaintiff class. \ng)  The Second Revised Settlement Agreement was negotiated fairly, honestly, without \ncollusion, and at arm’s length within the meaning of Rule 23(e)(2)(B).  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(e)(2)(B); Jones, 741 F.2d at 324.  The parties vigorously litigated this case \nprior to resolution and reached the proposed settlement only after lengthy and \ncontentious negotiations and with Judge Yarbrough’s assistance. \nh)  The relief to be provided to the class is adequate, taking into account the factors \nlisted in Rule 23(e)(2)(C).  With respect to the costs, risks, and delay of trial and \nappeal, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C)(i), class counsel agreed to a compromise \nregarding the relief they sought only after careful consideration of the relevant \ncircumstances, including possible benefits to the class that could be achieved by \nfurther litigation, the length of time this action has been pending and is likely to \ncontinue, the expense of further litigation, the risks and costs of further delay, the \ncomplexity of the litigation, and the risk to the class of achieving a less favorable \noutcome.  \ni)  In  particular,  in  agreeing  to  cede  the  provision  in  the  1991  Consent  Decree \nproviding that its overcrowding restrictions would remain in place in perpetuity, \nclass counsel weighed the substantial likelihood that this provision would not \nsurvive the termination provisions of the PLRA.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b).  In this \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 19 of 28\nregard, counsel prudently exchanged a provision that Congress’ enactment of the \nPLRA rendered unenforceable for real, binding benefits for the class.  Also, by \nagreeing to a reduction from 60 to 50 square feet of combined living and sleeping \nspace per inmate, class counsel obtained Defendants’ agreement that the 50 square \nfeet  per  inmate  excludes  bathrooms  and  dayrooms,  which  Defendants  had \npreviously disputed.15  Further, class counsel obtained Defendants’ agreement to \naward 30 days of good time after completion of each stage of the Residential Drug \nAbuse Program (“RDAP”), instead of a single lump-sum award after completion of \nall three stages, by agreeing to a reduction of the total good time awarded from 120 \nto 90 days.16  This substantially benefits the Plaintiff class because, previously, \nmembers who failed to complete all three stages received no good time for the \nstages they did complete; and, class members who were unable to complete all three \nstages, e.g., because the waiting list was too long or their sentences were too short, \ncould not benefit from the program at all.  Additionally, the change brings good \ntime awards for participation in the RDAP into compliance with Section 33-2-34 \nof the New Mexico Statutes Annotated.  See N.M. Stat. Ann. § 33-2-34(D)(1) \n(prisoners  are  eligible  for  good  time  award  of  one  month  “for  successfully \ncompleting an approved . . . substance abuse . . . program”).  In these respects, as \nin many others, “serious questions of law and fact” existed that placed the ultimate \n \n15 At the February 3, 2020 hearing, the parties clarified that the requirement of no less than 50 square feet of combined \nliving and sleeping space per inmate, excluding dayrooms and bathrooms, applies to all multiple occupancy cells, \nincluding double occupancy cells.  (See Doc. 3200-1 at 2 ¶ 1(a).)  The parties also clarified that “bathrooms” include \nin-cell toilets and sinks.  \n \n16 According to the Second Revised Settlement Agreement, the three individual stages of the RDAP are:  (1) \nOrientation and Rational Thinking; (2) Criminal Lifestyle – Living with Others; and, (3) Recovery, Maintenance, and \nTransition Living.  (Doc. 3200-1 at 8 ¶ 5.) \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 20 of 28\noutcome of the litigation in doubt, and informed class counsel’s positions during \nsettlement negotiations.  Jones, 741 F.2d at 324. \nj)  Also, class counsel reasonably determined that “the value of an immediate recovery \noutweigh[ed] the mere possibility of future relief after protracted and expensive \nlitigation.”  Id.  In this regard, class counsel was properly cognizant that “[a]ny \nmotion to modify or terminate prospective relief made under” the PLRA operates \nas an automatic stay of the prospective relief beginning 30 to 90 days after the \nmotion is filed.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(e)(2), (3).  Thus, had Defendants not withdrawn \ntheir motion to terminate the 1991 Consent Decree’s overcrowding restrictions \npursuant  to  the  parties’  agreement  to  engage  in  settlement  negotiations,  the \nrestrictions would likely have been stayed after 30 to 90 days while the parties \nlitigated Defendants’ motion.  \nk)  With respect to the second consideration listed in Rule 23(e)(2)(C), the proposed \nmethod of distributing relief to the class is likely to be effective.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(ii).  The Second Revised Settlement Agreement provides for entry of \n“an access order that reasonably permits Plaintiffs to monitor compliance” with the \nagreement and requires the parties to “collaborate in the exchange of information \nnecessary to ensure the Defendants’ compliance with and expeditious resolution” \nof the agreement.  (Doc. 3200-1 at 12 ¶¶ 19-20.)  Also, “[w]here absolutely \nnecessary,” Plaintiffs may seek formal discovery. (Id. at 12 ¶ 20.)  Finally, the \nSecond  Revised  Settlement  Agreement  allows  the  parties  to  obtain  judicial \ndeterminations regarding Defendants’ substantial and sustained compliance with \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 21 of 28\nthe agreement’s terms, should the parties disagree about whether such compliance \nhas been achieved.17  (Id. at 12-13 ¶ 21.) \nl)  With respect to the third consideration under Rule 23(e)(2)(C), the Second Revised \nSettlement Agreement does not address the award of attorneys’ fees and costs to \nclass counsel, except to preserve the parties’ rights to litigate this issue at a later \ndate.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C)(iii); (Doc. 3200-1 at 13 ¶ 26.)  Whether attorneys’ \nfees are awarded, and in what amount, in no way affects the relief that class \nmembers will receive pursuant to the agreement. \nm) With respect to Rule 23(e)(2)(C)’s final consideration, counsel have stated that the \nMonitoring and Access Agreement they filed on January 27, 2020 is the only \n“agreement made in connection with” the proposed settlement.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(iv), (e)(3); (see Doc. 3178.)  The Monitoring and Access Agreement \ndoes not affect the relief that class members will receive pursuant to the Second \nRevised Settlement Agreement. \nn)  Turning to Rule 23(e)(2)(D), the Second Revised Settlement Agreement treats class \nmembers equitably relative to each other.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(D).  Many \nprovisions apply to the class as a whole; and, those provisions that treat class \nmembers differently – e.g., where some categories of prisoners are entitled to \ngreater relief than others – are equitable and objectively reasonable because they \n \n17 Defendants report that they have designated an employee at NMCD’s central office who will be responsible for \nmonitoring Defendants’ compliance with the Second Revised Settlement Agreement and who will report directly to \nSecretary Tafoya Lucero in this regard.  This measure is likely to improve the efficient distribution of relief to the \nPlaintiff class but the Second Revised Settlement Agreement does not require it.  (See generally Doc. 3200-1.) \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 22 of 28\naccount for particular circumstances at specific facilities and avoid adverse impacts \non public safety in accordance with the PLRA.18  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1), (c)(1). \no)  For these reasons, the terms of the Second Revised Settlement Agreement are fair, \nreasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Plaintiff class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(e)(2). \np)  The Second Revised Settlement Agreement provides for “prospective relief,” i.e., \n“relief other than compensatory monetary damages,” in a “civil action with respect \nto prison conditions.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1), (g)(7).  Thus, and because the \nagreement falls within the statute’s definition of a “consent decree,” it must comply \nwith the PLRA’s requirements for prospective relief.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(c)(1) \n(“consent decree” must comply with PLRA’s requirements for prospective relief); \n18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(1) (“consent decree” is “any relief entered by the court that is \nbased in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties”). \nq)  In compliance with the PLRA, the prospective relief provided for in the Second \nRevised Settlement Agreement is “narrowly drawn.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1); see \nalso Jackson v. Los Lunas Cmty. Program, 880 F.3d 1176, 1192 (10th Cir. 2018) \n(federal consent decrees must be “designed as nearly as possible to restore the \nvictims of illegal conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence \nof such conduct”) (brackets omitted).  The prospective relief is specific, concrete, \nand carefully composed to directly address conditions flowing from and related to \n \n18 For example, the Second Revised Settlement Agreement excludes sex offenders, serious violent offenders, and \noffenders serving sentences for a DWI sixth or higher from the benefits of Paragraph 16, which requires NMCD to \nrecommend reduced parole time for parolees who are class members at the time of completion of their sentence and \nwho serve half of their parole without a major violation.  (Doc. 3200-1 at 10-11 ¶ 16.)  This exclusion prevents the \nearly termination of parole for categories of offenders likely to pose a significant risk to public safety. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 23 of 28\novercrowding in the prison facilities in which class members are incarcerated, \nwhich conditions are sufficient to constitute violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.19 \nr)  In compliance with the PLRA, the prospective relief provided for in the Second \nRevised Settlement Agreement “extends no further than necessary to correct the \nviolation of” the federal constitutional rights of the Plaintiff class.  18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(1); see also Jackson, 880 F.3d at 1192 (federal consent decrees must be \n“tailored to cure the condition that offends federal law”) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The prospective relief is limited in scope and tailored to cure conditions \nflowing from and related to overcrowding in the prison facilities in which class \nmembers are incarcerated, which conditions are sufficient to constitute violations \nof the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Second Revised Settlement \nAgreement also includes mechanisms to ensure that the prospective relief is kept in \nplace only as long as necessary to cure the unconstitutional conditions.  Jackson, \n880 F.3d at 1192. \ns)  In compliance with the PLRA, the prospective relief provided for in the Second \nRevised Settlement Agreement “is the least intrusive means necessary to correct \nthe violation of” the federal constitutional rights of the Plaintiff class.  18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(1); see also Jackson, 880 F.3d at 1192 (federal consent decrees “must take \ninto account the interests of state and local authorities in managing their own \naffairs, consistent with the demands of federal law”) (quotation marks omitted).  In \nthis regard, the Court notes that Defendants actively participated in crafting the \n \n19 On a tour of SCC with counsel from both sides, the undersigned personally observed and heard from inmates and \nstaff about some of these conditions. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 24 of 28\nprospective relief, agreed to it, and determined and stipulated that it is the least \nintrusive means to correct the unconstitutional conditions at issue. \nt)  Further, Defendants have identified, and the Court has discerned, no adverse impact \non public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system that the prospective \nrelief would cause.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1).  In particular, the award of “one \nmonth’s worth of good time” to eligible class members housed at OCPF during the \ntime period specified in Paragraph 17 does not adversely impact public safety, \nnotwithstanding the fact that OCPF primarily houses sex offenders.  (Doc. 3200-1 \nat 11 ¶ 17.)  The Court so finds because:  (1) each inmate is entitled to receive the \naward in question only once; (2) inmates’ potential eligibility for the award is \nreasonably limited in time frame, i.e., from October 2016 to Defendants’ substantial \ncompliance with Paragraph 1(b)(iv); and, (3) the award must be “consistent with” \nSection 33-2-34(A) of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated, (id.), which limits such \nawards to “a maximum of four days per month of time served” for serious violent \noffenders, including most of the eligible class members housed at OCPF.  N.M. \nStat. Ann. § 33-2-34(A)(1), (L)(4); (Doc. 3200 at 5.) \nu)  Finally, no part of the Second Revised Settlement Agreement, if adopted by this \nCourt, would constitute a “prisoner release order” within the meaning of the PLRA.  \n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3), (g)(4).  Specifically, the agreement does not have “the \npurpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population,” nor does it “direct[] \nthe release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4).  \nAt the February 3, 2020 hearing, Defendants confirmed that they will be able to \nprovide class members with the required 50 square feet of combined living and \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 25 of 28\nsleeping space per inmate by means other than reducing or limiting the prison \npopulation or releasing prisoners before they are due to be released, including by \ntransferring prisoners from overcrowded facilities to underutilized ones.  The \nmodifications  to  certain  good-time  award  policies  bring  such  awards  into \ncompliance with Section 33-2-34 of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated and are \ndesigned to increase participation in the RDAP, which benefits not only the class \nbut also the communities to which class members will return when they are \nreleased.  Provisions regarding the retraining of records staff, the early submission \nof forms to the Parole Board, and medical and geriatric parole are designed to \nensure that class members receive the good-time awards and parole to which they \nare entitled and that their parole planning is timely accomplished.  Finally, the \ngood-time awards provided for in Paragraph 17 are expressly remedial in nature \nand designed to compensate class members for the unconstitutional conditions in \nwhich they have been housed.20  \nv)  Thus,  the  Second  Revised  Settlement  Agreement  is  fully  compliant  with  the \nrequirements of the PLRA.  18 U.S.C. § 3626. \n30.   The Court has scrupulously considered all of the objections to the proposed settlement filed \nin this case and finds that none of them are sufficient to undermine the settlement’s fairness, \nadequacy, and reasonableness.  The Court has already addressed:  (a) the loss of the provision \nproviding that certain overcrowding restrictions in the 1991 Consent Decree would remain in \nplace in perpetuity; (b) the reduction of the required dimensions for dormitories and multiple \n \n20 Other provisions, such as those addressing staff recruitment and bathroom facilities, obviously do not have the \npurpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, nor do they direct the release from or nonadmission of \nprisoners to a prison. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 26 of 28\noccupancy cells from 60 to 50 square feet per inmate; and, (c) the reduction in total good time \nawarded for completion of the RDAP.  For the reasons discussed above, these terms do not \nvitiate the fairness, reasonableness, or adequacy of the proposed settlement.  The bulk of the \nobjections regarding the adequacy of the proposed settlement’s remedial relief concern the \nexclusion of class members housed at OCPF from being eligible to receive a remedial good \ntime award.  However, as modified in the Second Revised Settlement Agreement, Paragraph \n17  strikes  a  proper  balance  between  preserving  public  safety  and  providing  reasonable \nremedial relief.  The proposed settlement is a compromise, as are all settlements.  The relief \nclass counsel successfully negotiated is fully adequate to protect the legitimate interests of \nclass members and inures to the benefit of the greatest number of class members impacted by \nthe unconstitutional conditions at issue without compromising public safety or imposing \nimpracticable or impossible burdens on NMCD.  And, the Court specifically finds that class \ncounsel in no way colluded with Defendants or defense counsel in reaching the proposed \nsettlement and that challenges to the adequacy of their representation are entirely without \nmerit.  None of the objections warrant disapproval of the proposed settlement and the Court \nwill therefore overrule them. \n31. The Court has determined that it is in the parties’ best interests and furthers the ends of justice \nfor this Court to approve the Second Revised Settlement Agreement. \nFor these reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows: \nA.  The Court APPROVES the Second Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. 3200-1) as fair, \nadequate, reasonable, and meeting all of the requirements of Rule 23(e) and the PLRA; \nB.  The objections to the proposed settlement filed by members of the Plaintiff class are not well \ntaken and are hereby OVERRULED; \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3205   Filed 02/14/20   Page 27 of 28\nC.  The Second Revised Settlement Agreement is ADOPTED as an Order of this Court and \nSUPERSEDES all consent decrees previously entered in this case, (see Doc. 3200-1 at 14 ¶ \n29); \nD.  The parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of the Second Revised Settlement Agreement \n(Doc. 3200) is GRANTED; \nE.  The Parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. 3184) \nand Joint Motion and Memorandum of Law for Approval of a Modification to Paragraph 12 \nof the Revised Settlement Agreement (Doc. 3186) are DENIED AS MOOT; \nF.  In light of the fact that the Second Revised Settlement Agreement “constitutes the entire set \nof obligations and duties necessary for Defendants’ full release from this litigation and all \nattendant Court orders in both the Duran and Klatt lawsuits,” (Doc. 3200-1 at 14 ¶ 29), the \nfollowing motions are also DENIED AS MOOT: (1) Plaintiffs’ Motion for Declaratory, \nInjunctive, and Remedial Relief Regarding Violations of the Court’s Stipulated Orders (Doc. \n2837); (2) Plaintiffs’ Motion for Declaratory, Injunctive and Remedial Relief at Northwestern \nNew Mexico Correctional Facility (Doc. 2928); and, (3) Plaintiffs’ Motion for Declaratory, \nInjunctive, and Remedial Relief Regarding Violations of the 1991 Settlement Agreement at \nWestern New Mexico Correctional Facility (Doc. 2929);  \nG.  Counsel are to confer with one another regarding the most expeditious and effective way to \nprovide objectors with the Second Revised Settlement Agreement and this Order.

No. 77-0721-JB.\nUnited States District Court, D. New Mexico.\nJune 27, 1986.\n511 *511 Ray Twohig, Albuquerque, N.M., for plaintiffs.\nJohn Bigelow, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., Santa Fe, N.M., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nBURCIAGA, District Judge.\nINTRODUCTION\nOn May 22, 1986, plaintiffs filed their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction to Prevent Irreparable Harm by Halting\nLayoffs of Staff and Filling Staff Vacancies. Plaintiffs sought an order requiring defendants to\n(1) cancel the layoffs of all New Mexico Department of Corrections employees scheduled to take\neffect on July 1, 1986 and cease any additional layoffs;\n(2) fill all vacant positions (positions that are currently unfilled and those that become vacant in the\nfuture);\n(3) rescind the directive requiring an additional 2% cut in the New Mexico Department of\nCorrections budget for any institutions covered by this Court's previous orders, and cease and\ndesist from any further reductions in the budget, services, or sources provided to the institutions\ncovered by this Court's orders;\n(4) for each institution where defendants fail to comply with the directives contained in paragraphs\n1, 2 and 3 above, cease to confine prisoners in said prison no later than 30 days following the\nentry of this order; and\n(5) close the dormitories at the Penitentiary of New Mexico.\nFor the reasons set forth in this Memorandum Opinion, defendants will be enjoined from reducing the level of\nmedical and mental health staff below the number of such staff authorized or approved to be employed by the\nNew Mexico Corrections Department during Fiscal Year 74, and to refrain from reducing the authorized or\napproved complement of security staff at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, Central New Mexico Correctional\nFacility, Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility or Western New Mexico Correctional Facility unless the\nminimal staffing levels identified as being necessary to provide a constitutional level of safety and security for\nprisoners have been achieved at those institutions. The Court also will enjoin defendants to fill existing vacancies\nand thus to employ at least the number of medical and mental health staff as well as the number of security staff\n512 authorized to be employed by the New Mexico Corrections Department *512 during Fiscal Year 74, including\ntemporary positions approved during that year.\n\nThe Court will deny plaintiffs' motion for an order rescinding any directive requiring an additional 2% cut in the\nNew Mexico Department of Corrections budget and will not enjoin defendants to cease and desist from any\nfurther reductions in the budget, services or resources provided to the institutions covered by this Court's orders,\nso long as the levels of medical, mental health and security staff mandated by the preliminary injunction are met.\nLikewise, the Court will deny plaintiffs' motion to cease confining prisoners in any prison that is not appropriately\nstaffed and will deny plaintiffs' motion for an order enjoining defendants to close the dormitories at the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico.\nPlaintiffs' motion, which was opposed by defendants, does not exist in a vacuum. On December 2, 1985,\ndefendants filed a motion to vacate or modify the judgment in this cause. On that same date plaintiffs moved for\nmodification of certain of the remedial orders in this cause, and filed a motion for contempt. All motions were\nopposed.\nOn January 10, 1986, the Court entered an order that plaintiffs' motion for contempt be severed into its two\ncomponents, a motion for civil contempt and a motion for criminal contempt. The Court at that time denied\nplaintiffs' motion for criminal contempt. The Court simultaneously entered an order assigning to the Special\nMaster appointed in this litigation specific fact finding duties with respect to plaintiffs' pending motion for civil\ncontempt. Specifically, the Special Master was directed to prepare proposed findings of fact with respect to all\nallegations of contempt contained in plaintiffs' motion and to submit those proposed findings to the parties. The\nCourt announced that, at the time of that submission, plaintiffs would be required to amend their motion for\ncontempt to provide clear and concise statements of the basis of their claim for relief, as well as the identity of all\npersons against whom they seek a finding of contempt. On the basis of that pleading, and any response thereto\nby defendants, the Court indicated it would determine whether an order directing defendants or others to show\ncause why they should not be held in contempt should issue.\nIn early June 1986, the Special Master informed the Court that the proposed findings of fact required by the\nCourt's earlier order had been prepared and submitted to the parties. On June 6, 1986, the Court entered an\norder requiring the parties to submit any objections they might have to the Special Master's proposed findings no\nlater than July 18, 1986. On or before August 8, 1986, the Special Master is required to file with the Court all\nfindings of fact to which neither party has objected. Proposed findings to which one or both parties object may be\nthe subject of requests for admission to Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Finally, the Court's June\n6, 1986 order directed plaintiffs to file, no later than August 22, 1986, an amended motion providing clear and\nconcise statements of the basis of their claim for relief, as well as the identity of all persons against whom\nplaintiffs seek a finding of contempt.\nPlaintiffs' pending motion for contempt seeks a finding of contempt and sanctions for alleged non-compliance\nwith the Court's orders relating to medical care, mental health care, security staffing and the closure of\ndormitories at the Penitentiary of New Mexico. Defendants' motion to modify seeks vacation or substantial\nmodification of the provisions of the Court's order relating to medical care, mental health care, and security\nstaffing. Thus, the Court contemplates that a plenary hearing will be held on these matters as quickly as possible\nafter plaintiffs have filed their amended complaint, defendants have had an opportunity to respond to that\ncomplaint, and any necessary discovery has been completed.\nApart from the pending motions for contempt and modification, plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction\n513 implicates several of the 20 comprehensive compliance *513 reports that have been filed by the Special Master\nand confirmed by the Court since the Special Master's appointment in June 1983. On April 19, 1984, the Special\nMaster filed his fourth report, which related to system-wide medical care. That report was confirmed, without\nobjection by defendants, by order entered on June 4, 1984. The Special Master's fifth report, filed on April 18,\n1984, related to mental health care throughout the New Mexico Corrections Department. Neither party filed any\nobjection to the findings or recommendations contained in that report, which was confirmed by order entered on\nJune 4, 1984. The Special Master's sixteenth report, relating to medical care and mental health care throughout\nthe New Mexico Corrections Department, was filed on August 23, 1985. After sustaining defendants' objection to\na finding concerning the existence of mental health logs at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility, the Court\nconfirmed the Special Master's sixteenth report by order entered on June 6, 1986.\n\nThe Special Master's fourth, fifth and sixteenth reports contain factual observations indicating serious deficiencies\nin the state of defendants' compliance with the Court's orders on medical care and mental health care. These\nfactual observations were adopted as findings of fact by the Court and are part of the record of this case.\nThe Special Master's second report, filed on March 5, 1984, addressed security staffing issues at the Penitentiary\nof New Mexico, Central New Mexico Correctional Facility and Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility. No\nparty filed any objection to the findings or recommendations set forth in that report, which was confirmed by order\nentered on April 2, 1984.\nThe Special Master's second report established, through adoption of the recommendations of the Court's expert\nconsultant on security staffing, minimal levels of security staffing required to be implemented to provide\nreasonable safety and security at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, Central New Mexico Correctional Facility and\nSouthern New Mexico Correctional Facility. The Special Master's factual observations regarding the minimal\nlevels of security staffing required at these institutions were adopted as findings of fact by the Court and are part\nof the record in this case.\nSubsequently, on February 11, 1985, the Special Master filed his seventeenth report on defendants' state of\ncompliance at Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility. That report, to which neither party filed any objection,\nwas confirmed on February 11, 1985. The Special Master's seventeenth report contained a number of factual\nobservations relating to defendants compliance with the security staffing provisions of the Court's order in this\ncause, and those factual observations were adopted as findings of fact by the Court.\nOn March 29, 1985, the Special Master filed his eighteenth report relating to the state of defendants' compliance\nwith the Court's orders at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility. That report contained a number of factual\nobservations relating to defendants' state of compliance with the security staffing provisions of the Court's order\nat Central New Mexico Correctional Facility, to which no objection was made by either party. The Special\nMaster's eighteenth report was confirmed by order entered on May 14, 1985, and the Special Master's factual\nobservations were adopted as findings of fact by the Court.\nThe Special Master filed his nineteenth report relating to defendants' state of compliance at the Penitentiary of\nNew Mexico on June 3, 1985. The nineteenth report contained, inter alia, factual observations by the Special\nMaster concerning defendants' state of compliance with the security staffing provisions of the Court's order at the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico. By order of June 11, 1986, the Court adopted as findings of fact all factual\n514 observations of the Special Master relating to security *514 staffing, and these findings of fact became part of the\n[1]\nrecord in this case.\nFinally, on January 26, 1986, the Special Master submitted his twentieth report relating to defendants' state of\ncompliance at Western New Mexico Correctional Facility. That report contained the recommendations of the\nCourt's expert consultant on security staffing regarding the minimal level of security staff required to provide\nreasonable safety and security to prisoners at Western New Mexico Correctional Facility. The Special Master's\nrecommendations with respect to the minimal security staffing level required, as well as all factual observations\nrelating to security staffing contained in the twentieth report, were confirmed by order entered on June 12, 1986.\nThe foregoing reports of the Special Master relating to security staffing contain numerous factual observations\nrelating to defendants' compliance with the security staffing provisions of the Court's order in this cause. A\nnumber of those factual observations, it should be noted, indicate non-compliance by defendants with security\nstaffing requirements in general, and the level of security staffing in particular.\nIn summary, plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction seeks an order enjoining reductions in current\nauthorized levels of medical, mental health and security staff following significant findings of non-compliance\nrelating to these issues in reports filed by the Special Master and confirmed by the Court. Moreover, plaintiffs'\nmotion for preliminary injunction is filed while cross motions for modification, including defendants' motion to\nvacate or modify the medical, mental health and security staffing provisions of the Court's order, as well as\nplaintiffs' motion for contempt, are pending before the Court. It is in this context that the Court must evaluate\nrelevant factual evidence adduced by the parties and apply controlling principles of law to plaintiffs' motion.\n\nThe parties agreed to submit all evidence relating to plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction by way of\ndeposition or in documentary form. This evidence consisted of the deposition of George E. Sullivan, the Warden\nof the Penitentiary of New Mexico, together with several exhibits to that deposition; the deposition of Alan\nShuman, Deputy Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department, together with certain exhibits to that\ndeposition; the deposition of Michael Francke, Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department, together\nwith several exhibits to that deposition; the deposition of Henry Cellini, Ph.D., the former Director of Mental\nHealth Services for the New Mexico Corrections Department, together with exhibits to that deposition; the\ndeposition of John S. Kormanik, the Director of Administrative Services Division of the Corrections Department,\nand Mr. Stephen D. Olsen, the Budget Director for the New Mexico Corrections Department, together with an\nexhibit to that deposition; the deposition of Jeffrey L. Metzner, M.D., plaintiffs' psychiatric expert; the deposition of\nRonald M. Shansky, M.D., defendants' medical expert; the deposition of Dennis F. Koson, M.D., defendants'\npsychiatric expert; the deposition of Lloyd T. Baccus, Ph.D., the Court's expert consultant on mental health care;\nthe deposition of Lambert N. King, M.D., the Court's expert consultant on physical medical care; and the\n515 deposition of C.W. Beaver, the Court's expert consultant on *515 security staffing. In addition, the parties\nsubmitted a stipulation regarding the testimony to be given by George E. Sullivan, the Warden of the Penitentiary\nof New Mexico, Dareld Kirby, the Warden of Central New Mexico Correctional Facility, Eloy Mondragon, the\nWarden of Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility, and Tom Newton, the Warden of Western New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility. Finally, several exhibits to plaintiffs' memorandum in support of their motion for preliminary\ninjunction and plaintiffs' reply memorandum in support of their motion for preliminary injunction were admitted into\nevidence. All the evidence described above was admitted without objection. In addition to receiving written and\ndocumentary evidence, the Court heard oral arguments by counsel in an open hearing conducted on June 18,\n1986.\nThe Court has reviewed carefully the evidence submitted by the parties in support of their respective positions.\nOn the basis of that review the Court has found relevant facts to which controlling principles of law must be\napplied. These findings of fact and conclusions of law follow.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI. PHYSICAL MEDICAL CARE:\n1. The number of positions authorized for medical care during Fiscal Year 74 (July 1, 1985 through June 30,\n1986) is 95.7. The number of medical positions authorized for Fiscal Year 75 (July 1, 1986 through June 30,\n1987) is 56. In addition to these 56 positions, 19.6 positions will be filled by contract or temporary personnel. A\ntotal of 20.1 positions, or approximately 21% of the medical positions authorized for Fiscal Year 74, will not be\nfilled in Fiscal Year 75. (Stipulated finding no. 4)\n2. The proposed budget reductions will have a devastating effect on the quality of medical care throughout the\nNew Mexico Corrections Department. (King deposition, p. 9)\n3. Budget reductions proposed for the medical department of the New Mexico Corrections Department will initiate\na deadly cycle of deterioration in the provision of health care services, will make it virtually impossible for existing\ndeficiencies to be remedied and will compromise markedly the quality of care throughout the system. (King\ndeposition, p. 10)\n4. The effect of proposed reductions in the medical staff throughout the New Mexico Corrections Department will\nbe deterioration of the overall quality of routine medical care, significant delays in the diagnoses of illnesses that\nmay result in death and the inability to provide necessary emergency care, the need for which will arise with\ngreater frequency if the prison population continues to grow beyond its current level. (King deposition, pp. 19-20)\n5. Adequacy of basic medical services will no longer be assured and preventable morbidity and mortality will\nincrease significantly. (Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion, Exhibit D)\n\n6. Should the reductions occur as scheduled on July 1, 1986, an emergency situation will exist with respect to\nhealth services within New Mexico Corrections Department facilities. Much of the extraordinary progress which\nhas been made will be in immediate jeopardy. Within a few months of these reductions, a demonstrable increase\nin morbidity and mortality is extremely probable. (Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion, Exhibit D)\n7. Staff reductions in the medical care department of the New Mexico Corrections Department will have a\nsystem-wide impact because of the existence of a central reception facility, a central infirmary facility and the\ncentralization of a number of other important aspects of medical care delivery. (King deposition, pp. 10, 47)\n8. In the 1985-86 fiscal year, the Corrections Department was appropriated approximately $1,313,000 for\ncontractual medical and mental health services. Actual expenditures in this area for the same period are currently\nprojected to be between $1,258,000 and $1,408,000. In the 1986-1987 fiscal year, the Department was\n516 appropriated *516 $1,600,000 for such contract services. (Stipulated finding no. 12)\n9. The effort of the New Mexico Corrections Department to ameliorate the negative effect of reductions in medical\nstaff by converting 19.6 positions to contract status will be unsuccessful, as the reductions in staff will increase\nthe number of referrals to outside hospitals and sub-specialty consultants. These referrals will consume funds\navailable for contractual services, and the Fiscal Year 75 contractual services budget will not be sufficient to meet\nall projected needs. (King deposition pp. 11-12)\n10. Proposed staff reductions in the office of Health Services in the New Mexico Corrections Department will\nhave the following specific negative effects:\na. The medical records system, already deficient in some respects, will deteriorate, with a consequent significant\nincrease in the probability that important laboratory results or x-ray results will not be followed up properly. (King\ndeposition, p. 12)\nb. The ability of the health delivery system to respond appropriately to emergent medical needs during the\nevening, night and weekend hours will be compromised to an irreparable degree. (King deposition, p. 13)\nc. The ability of the Health Services system to recruit and retain the kind of professionals necessary to provide\nadequate medical care will be devastated. (King deposition, p. 13)\nd. Compliance with the provisions of the Court's order on medical care will become virtually impossible. (King\ndeposition, p. 15)\ne. If a substantial increase in population occurs at existing institutions, more prisoners will be at risk as a result of\nmedical staff reductions. Any such population increase will have deleterious effects in terms of increased risk of\ntransmission of infectious diseases, increased stress and increased demand on medical services. Any such\npopulation increase also will necessitate increased staffing for the provision of emergency care. (King deposition,\npp. 15-16)\nf. The reductions will interfere with needed in-service training and education for medical staff and will eliminate\nthe safety net that has existed in the past in the form of the ability of existing staff to adjust for temporary losses\nduring periods when a position is vacant. (King deposition, pp. 10-11)\n11. The proposed reduction in psychological services staff throughout the Corrections Department will result in a\nmarked increase in demands on physical medical staff, e.g., monitoring the side effects of anti-psychotic\nmedication that can have irreversible effects on the central nervous system in the form of retardation and\namnesia. (King deposition, pp. 17-18)\n12. The proposed reduction of five registered nurses scheduled for staffing the acute care psychiatric unit at the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico is extremely dangerous because of the close medical monitoring required by\npsychotic patients. Health Services (as opposed to psychological services) staff will not be able to adequately\nmonitor these patients. (King deposition, p. 31)\n\n13. The reduction of Health Services staff contemplated as a result of the reduced budget approved by the New\nMexico legislature will, in opinion of defendants' medical expert, create significant problems in the very near\nfuture. These problems include a medical records system breakdown, staffing shortages in terms of providing\nboth routine and emergency care and the inability to recruit and retain staff. (Shansky deposition, p. 22)\n14. Defendants' medical expert testified that three additional licensed practical nurse positions, two and one-half\nadditional clerical positions, and one-half additional dentist's position beyond the level of staffing projected for\nFiscal Year 75 are needed to prevent irreparable damage to the ability of the State to provide medical services,\n517 both emergent and routine. These additional staff are required to prevent a medical *517 catastrophe. (Shansky\ndeposition, pp. 7, 8) [With respect to LPN positions, see Shansky deposition, pp. 10, 13 and 14. With respect to\nclerical positions, see Shansky deposition, pp. 11, 13 and 14-15. With respect to dental positions, see Shansky\ndeposition, pp. 14, 17.]\n16. The Penitentiary of New Mexico, Western New Mexico Correctional Facility and Southern New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility have not had significant excess medical staff in their budgets. (King deposition, p. 48)\n17. The Health Services office of the New Mexico Corrections Department will almost certainly run far short of\nmonies that are necessary to continue to provide the most basic level of institutional care, as well as outside\ncare, well in advance of the end of Fiscal Year 75. (King deposition, p. 51)\n18. The system-wide total population on June 10, 1986 at Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility, Central\nNew Mexico Correctional Facility, Western New Mexico Correctional Facility and the Penitentiary of New Mexico\nwas 1,938. (Stipulated finding no. 10)\n19. The Corrections Department has averaged a net gain in inmate population system-wide of approximately 19\ninmates per month, and growth is expected to continue at the present rate for the next fiscal year. (Stipulated\nfinding no. 5)\n20. One hundred and thirty-six prisoners were housed in day rooms or common areas at Western New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility, Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility and Central New Mexico Correctional Facility on\nJune 10, 1986. (Stipulated finding no. 7)\n21. The Health Services Administrator employed by Defendants at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility has\nacknowledged that a substantially increased population at that institution will result in an increased spread of\ninfluenza, hepatitis, infectious gastroenteritis, venereal disease and AIDS. The Central New Mexico Correctional\nFacility Health Services Administrator also acknowledged that a substantial increase in population will increase\npsychological stress resulting in fist fights, overdoses, stabbings, suicide attempts, mental stress and trauma\nresulting in hospitalization and death. Finally, defendants Health Services Administrator for CNMCF\nacknowledged that a substantial increase in population at that institution will greatly increase demand for medical\nservices. (King deposition, appendix D)\n22. Five of the medical positions projected to be lost commencing July 1, 1986, have not been filled in the last\nyear; one medical position scheduled to be lost on July 1, 1986, was not filled for at least six months during last\nyear. (Stipulated finding no. 13)\n23. The Corrections Department sought an increase of three full time equivalent medical positions for the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico (North Facility) and a .5 full time equivalent medical position at Western New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility. The three full time equivalent medical positions at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (North\nFacility) were intended to provide on site medical service at the North Facility, and the .5 full time equivalent\nposition at Western New Mexico Correctional Facility was intended to provide a records clerk. (Francke\ndeposition, Exhibit 21 at p. 733; Francke deposition, p. 395-96)\n24. It is the opinion of Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department that it will be impossible to provide\nthe level of medical care mandated by the Court's orders in Duran v. Anaya within the restrictions imposed by the\nFiscal Year 75 budget for adult health services. (Francke deposition, p. 398)\n\n25. The vacancy rate among medical staff positions increased after the Legislative Finance Committee budget\nwas published, and the finalization of the Fiscal Year 75 budget created a desperate situation with regard to filling\nmedical vacancies for the remainder of Fiscal Year 74. As a result, the Corrections Department will be\n518 significantly impaired in its ability to deliver a wide range of medical services *518 into the foreseeable future.\n(Francke deposition, pp. 401-02)\n26. The adult health services division of the Corrections Department historically has been beset by problems in\nrecruiting and retaining qualified staff. (Francke, deposition, p. 402)\n27. If Health Services positions are eliminated and then restored, substantial difficulty and delay will be incurred\nin filling those positions. This difficulty and delay will result from the significant deterioration of the health care\nsystem, which will make it more difficult to recruit qualified professionals. (King deposition, pp. 18-19)\n28. On February 18, 1986, the Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department informed Governor Toney\nAnaya that the impact of proposed staffing reductions in the medical area \"will devastate our medical ... and\ndental system.\" The Secretary also stated that the effect of these reductions would be \"an increased likelihood of\nphysical suffering and loss of life in the institutions. This includes staff as well as inmates.\" The Secretary\ndescribed the effect of staffing reductions in the medical care area in the following terms:\nHowever, we have dismantled the medical system, leaving our Correctional Officers to struggle\nwith medical emergencies and insane-inmates. We have had three Officers in the hospital in the\nlast several weeks as the result of attacks by insane inmates even as our psychiatric nurses were\nquitting in response to the job security panic caused by the LFC budget cuts in medical. These\ncuts now are a reality. (Francke deposition, Exhibit 22, p. 3)\nThe Secretary of Corrections predicted that, if the staffing reductions contemplated by the Fiscal Year 75 budget\noccur, \"the toll of the inevitable disturbances [will] rise.\" (Francke deposition, Exhibit 22, p. 3) The Secretary's\ncomments were based on an assumption that 41 positions of 126 would be cut. In fact, primarily because of the\nemployment of contract and temporary personnel, 31.6 medical and mental health positions from a total of 127.7\nsuch positions authorized during Fiscal Year 74 will not be filled in Fiscal Year 75. (Francke deposition, Exhibit 22,\np. 2; Stipulated finding no. 4)\n29. On January 30, 1986, the Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department informed Governor Toney\nAnaya that the reduction in medical staff positions would jeopardize the provision of 24-hour nursing coverage.\nHe stated, \"The medium institutions have a steady stream of medical emergencies after normal work hours and\nloss of coverage after hours could jeopardize human life.\" (Francke deposition, Exhibit 25, p. 2)\n30. On January 24, 1986, the Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department made the following written\ncomment to New Mexico State Representative Jerry Sandel, Chairman of the Legislative Finance Committee:\nThere is no realistic way to meet our consent decree obligation of adequate medical and mental\nhealth care to provide for basic health needs with a reduction of 41 FTE and a difference of over a\nmillion and a half dollars from the executive recommendation. Such a severe cutback raises a\nquestion of our ability to comply with the minimal standards of the constitution in the medical and\nmental health care areas. ... If the legislature cuts our medical staff drastically, we will not be able\nto build back up to the required levels for a long time, perhaps measurable in years. This is due to\nour difficulty in recruiting medical personnel to work in a correctional setting at salaries the State\nprovides. We have an excellent health system now and my comments to the media were based\non a belief that the cuts proposed by the LFC in this are wrong. (Francke deposition, Exhibit 26, p.\n3)\n\nII. MENTAL HEALTH CARE:\n1. Thirty-two psychologists and mental health support personnel were authorized in the Fiscal Year 74 budget for\n519 the New Mexico Corrections Department. The Fiscal Year 75 budget will result in the elimination *519 of 11.5, or\n36%, of these positions. (Stipulated finding no. 1)\n2. Two psychologist positions at the Penitentiary of New Mexico and one psychologist position at Southern New\nMexico Correctional Facility were not filled for at least six months during Fiscal Year 74. (Stipulated finding no.\n13)\n3. There are significant deficiencies in the delivery of routine essential psychiatric services to prisoners in the\nNew Mexico Corrections Department. (Baccus deposition, pp. 6-8) The effect of proposed staffing reductions in\nthe mental health area will further compromise the Department's ability to provide routine, adequate mental\nhealth care, including emergent care. (Baccus deposition, pp. 10-11; Metzner deposition, pp. 12-13)\n4. There are prisoners throughout the New Mexico Corrections Department who are not receiving needed in-\npatient psychiatric services as well as necessary intermediate psychiatric care. Some of those individuals are at\nrisk to endanger themselves or others in the absence of the required care. (Baccus deposition, pp. 67-68;\nMetzner deposition, p. 9)\n5. Historically, the funding of the New Mexico Corrections Department has not been sufficient to meet the clinical\nneeds for psychiatric treatment of the inmate population. (Baccus deposition, pp. 69-70)\n6. There are prisoners in the New Mexico Corrections Department at this time who are suffering irreparable harm\nin the form of psychic distress for which adequate treatment is not being given. (Baccus deposition, p. 77) The\nnumber of prisoners who suffer such harm and the degree of that harm will increase if the staffing reductions\nrequired by the Fiscal Year 75 Corrections Department budget go into effect and existing vacancies are not filled.\n(Baccus deposition, p. 77)\n7. If staffing reductions occur, out-patient services will be reduced at Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility\nand Central New Mexico Correctional Facility, where mental health services necessarily will focus increasingly on\nproviding emergency evaluation and assessments, dispositional assessments, crisis intervention and short-term\ngroup therapy. (Baccus deposition, p. 12)\n8. The most severe impact of the mental health staffing reductions will be felt at the Penitentiary of New Mexico.\nResources will not be adequate to provide required intermediate or acute treatment. (Baccus deposition, p. 13)\n9. Filling current vacancies and halting proposed reductions of mental health staff will reduce the likelihood of\nunnecessary pain and suffering by prisoners in the New Mexico Corrections Department. (Baccus deposition, p.\n13; Metzner deposition, p. 14) The pain and suffering that will be avoided include self-mutilating behavior, suicidal\nbehavior, assaultive behavior and impairment of the capacity for self care. Symptoms that will be avoided include\nhallucinations, delusions, sense of fear, foreboding, helplessness and depression. (Baccus deposition, p. 14)\n10. If current vacancies are not filled and scheduled layoffs halted, a significant number of prisoners will\nexperience deterioration in their mental health, non-compliance with their medication regimen, a greater\nlikelihood of unprovoked, assaultive or self mutilating behavior or instances of impaired judgment resulting in\nincreased disciplinary actions and/or behaviors. These actions will place the affected prisoners, their peers and\ncorrectional and administrative staff at risk. (Baccus deposition, p. 15)\n11. Proposed reductions in mental health staff will reduce the capacity of the Department to identify prisoners\nwho require treatment for mental illness or mental retardation. (Baccus deposition, pp. 15-16)\n12. The projected reduction in mental health staff will render impossible or adversely affect compliance with\nnumerous provisions of the Court's order on mental health care. (Baccus deposition, pp. 16-20)\n520\n\n*520 13. The mental health programs of the Penitentiary of New Mexico and those in place at Southern New\nMexico Correctional Facility, Central New Mexico Correctional Facility and Western New Mexico Correctional\nFacility are interrelated. The proposed reduction in mental health staff at the Penitentiary of New Mexico will\nresult in attempts to retain at the satellite institutions prisoners who require acute and intermediate care that\nshould be offered at the Penitentiary of New Mexico. This in turn will result in increased self destructive behavior\nby prisoners at the medium security institutions and a consequent increase in the incidence of assaults and\nbehavioral management problems arising from increased mental health problems within the populations of those\ninstitutions. (Baccus deposition, pp. 21-22; Koson deposition, p. 36)\n14. The forensic unit at the State Hospital in Las Vegas, New Mexico has never provided an adequate response\nto the need of prisoners for acute psychiatric care. (Baccus deposition, p. 39)\n15. If the mental health staff authorized for Fiscal Year 74 are employed during Fiscal Year 75, it will be possible\nfor an acute care unit to be opened at the Penitentiary of New Mexico. (Baccus deposition, p. 72) Particularly in\nview of the limited usefulness of the forensic treatment unit at the New Mexico State Hospital, there is a pressing\nneed for the opening of an acute care unit to be operated by the Corrections Department. (Baccus deposition, pp.\n72, 39.)\n16. The staffing reductions projected for Fiscal Year 75 will make it impossible for the Corrections Department to\nopen an acute care mental health unit. (Francke deposition, p. 400)\n17. Increased reliance on the forensic treatment unit of the New Mexico State Hospital in Las Vegas is not a\nrealistic option for the provision of acute care to mentally ill prisoners. The State Hospital is reluctant to accept\nviolent, mentally ill felons who are predatory and assaultive. (Francke deposition, p. 399)\n18. The prospective termination of mental health staff on July 1, 1986 has increased and will continue to increase\ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining mental health personnel, and will have an adverse impact on the morale of\nthe remaining staff. (Baccus deposition, p. 70; Francke deposition, pp. 401-02)\n19. Other than crisis intervention, no mental health treatment is being afforded to female prisoners at Western\nNew Mexico Correctional Facility. (Baccus deposition, p. 72; Koson deposition, p. 28)\n20. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that the present level of mental health staffing at the Penitentiary of\nNew Mexico is insufficient to provide minimally adequate treatment because of the absence of an in-patient\nfacility for the provision of acute care. (Koson deposition, pp. 10-11)\n21. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that five support staff are necessary at the Penitentiary of New Mexico\nto provide minimally adequate psychiatric care to prisoners at that facility. Only two such staff are authorized for\nFiscal Year 75. (Koson deposition, p. 12; Stipulated finding no. 4)\n22. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that the current level of seven psychologists is required to provide\nminimally adequate psychiatric care to prisoners at the Penitentiary of New Mexico. Only six psychologist\npositions are authorized for Fiscal Year 75. (Koson deposition, pp. 8, 27; Stipulated finding no. 4)\n23. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that approximately ten prisoners at the Penitentiary of New Mexico\nrequire in-patient acute care that cannot be delivered under present circumstances. (Koson deposition, p. 15)\n24. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that the loss of one psychologist position at Western New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility would impair \"a system-wide case finding of diagnostic effort, but not to the extent that\nirreparable harm would be caused.\" (Koson deposition, p. 17)\n521 *521 25. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that any reduction in the number of psychologists at Central New\nMexico Correctional Facility would require the cessation of essential mental health services to a number of\nprisoners at that facility. One psychologist position has been eliminated in the Fiscal Year 75 budget. (Koson\ndeposition, p. 19; Stipulated finding no. 4)\n26. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that any reduction in secretarial personnel for the mental health\nprogram at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility would be unacceptable and would cut directly into\n\nprofessional staff time. One half position has been eliminated in the Fiscal Year 1975 budget. (Koson deposition,\np. 22; Stipulated finding no. 4)\n27. It is the opinion of the former and current mental health directors of the New Mexico Corrections Department\nthat 96 beds are needed to provide intermediate level psychiatric care. At the present time, only 48 beds are\navailable for that level of care. The expansion of the number of intermediate care beds will require additional\nmental health staff. (Metzner deposition, pp. 57-59)\n28. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that prisoners who are in need of intermediate psychiatric care, but\nwho are assigned to the general population at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, are suffering irreparable harm.\n(Koson deposition, p. 31)\n29. In the event of increased population and a decrease in other treatment programs such as educational\nprogramming, the need for mental health services will increase. (Koson deposition, p. 37)\n30. Defendants' psychiatric expert testified that the number of prisoners who suffer irreparable harm and the\ndegree of that irreparable harm will increase if the mental health staffing reductions presently proposed go into\neffect and existing vacancies are not filled. (Koson deposition, pp. 39-40)\n31. The Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department testified that budget reductions relating to mental\nhealth personnel will cause the Department to \"be unable to provide mental health care mandated by the decree\n[in Duran v. Anaya] to any significant respect.\" On February 18, 1986, the Secretary informed Governor Toney\nAnaya that the impact of proposed staffing reductions \"will devastate our ... mental health system.\" He stated that\nthe proposed staff reductions would result in \"an increased likelihood of physical suffering and loss of life in the\ninstitutions. This includes staff as well as inmates.\" (Francke deposition, p. 398; Exhibit 22, p. 2)\n32. The Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department testified that the most substantial problem resulting\nfrom proposed staffing reductions in the medical area \"involves the mental health requirements of the decree\nwhich deal with people who are suffering from mental illness, people who have an acute phase of a mental\nillness, people who have alcohol and drug problems. I don't see any way in the world we can begin to comply\nwith all those requirements with a reduced staffing level. We're hard pressed to do it now.\" (Francke deposition,\npp. 403-404)\nIII. SECURITY STAFFING:\n1. A substantial increase in institutional population will create a need for additional security staff. (Beaver\ndeposition, p. 12)\n2. The opening of additional modular housing units for female prisoners at Western New Mexico Correctional\nFacility will create a need for additional security staff at that institution. (Beaver deposition, pp. 13-14)\n3. Mr. C.W. Beaver, the Court's expert consultant on security staffing, determined that 145 correctional officers\nare required to provide minimally adequate security and safety for prisoners at Western New Mexico Correctional\nFacility. On December 31, 1985, only 128 correctional officers were employed at that institution. (Beaver\n[1]\ndeposition, pp. 26-30)\n522 *522 4. Mr. C.W. Beaver, the Court's expert consultant on security staffing, determined that 197.8 correctional\nofficers are required to provide minimally adequate security and safety for prisoners at Southern New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility. As of February 17, 1986, 200 correctional officers were employed at that institution. (Beaver\ndeposition, pp. 26-30)\n5. When Mr. C.W. Beaver's security staffing recommendations for Central New Mexico Correctional Facility are\nadjusted to take into account the transfer of the Reception and Diagnostic Center as well as all female prisoners\nto Western New Mexico Correctional Facility, approximately 198 correctional officers are required to provide\nminimally adequate security and safety for prisoners at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility. (Special\n\nMaster's Eighteenth Report, pp. 8-9) As of February 17, 1986, 202 correctional officers were employed at that\ninstitution. (Beaver deposition, p. 26)\n6. Mr. C.W. Beaver, the Court's expert consultant on security staffing, determined that approximately 329.46\ncorrectional officers are required to provide minimally adequate security and safety for prisoners at the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico00Main and the Penitentiary of New Mexico00North. On March 21, 1986, 302\n97 97\ncorrectional officers were employed in those facilities. (Beaver deposition, pp. 26, 31; Sullivan deposition, Exhibit\n6)\n7. As the result of the Fiscal Year 75 budget for the New Mexico Corrections Department, eight existing\ncorrectional officer positions will be eliminated at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (Main and North facilities),\nfourteen existing correctional officer positions will be eliminated at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility,\nfourteen existing correctional officer positions will be eliminated at Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility and\neight new correctional officer positions will be added to the complement at Western New Mexico Correctional\nFacility. (Stipulated finding no. 11)\n8. Following the reduction in correctional officer positions, the Penitentiary of New Mexico (Main and North\nfacilities) will be 35.46 correctional officer positions short of the minimal level of security staffing recommended by\nMr. Beaver. Following the reductions in security staffing, Central New Mexico Correctional Facility will be 10\ncorrectional officer positions short of the minimal level of security staffing recommended by Mr. Beaver, and\nSouthern New Mexico Correctional Facility will be 12 correctional officer positions short of the minimal level of\nsecurity staffing recommended by Mr. Beaver. Even with the increase of 8 correctional officer positions, Western\nNew Mexico Correctional Facility will be 9 correctional officer positions short of the minimal level of security\nstaffing recommended by Mr. Beaver. Moreover, the shortfall at Western New Mexico Correctional Facility fails to\ntake into account the opening of new modular housing units for female prisoners, which were not considered by\nMr. Beaver when he made his recommendation. (Beaver deposition, pp. 26, 30-31; Stipulated finding no. 11)\n9. Security staff will be adversely affected by excessive overtime work as a result of the understaffing of the\ninstitutions subject to the Court's orders in this litigation. (Beaver deposition, p. 32) In addition, prisoners will be\nrequired to remain in their housing units for longer periods of time, and inmate idleness will increase. (Beaver\ndeposition, pp. 32-33)\n10. Prisoner idleness at Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility will increase as a result of staff reductions at\nthat institution. (Francke deposition, p. 424)\n523 *523 11. The Court's expert consultant on security staffing testified that the security staff reductions that are\ncontemplated will result in a \"scenario at this time come July 1 (that) would be very similar to the scenario that\noccurred prior to the 1980 disturbance. ... I don't want to be a predictor of doom and tragedy, but I do think that\nit's a distinct possibility.\" (Beaver deposition, p. 33)\n12. The Court's expert consultant on security staffing testified that \"with the reduced staff, the likelihood of an\nemergency occurring is increased more than it is if they have adequate staff.\" (Beaver deposition, p. 49)\n13. There is a direct, inverse correlation between the incidence of acts and threats of violence by and between\ninmates, on the one hand, and the types and amounts of educational, recreational, work and other programs\navailable to inmates, on the other 00i.e., acts and threats of violence tend to decrease as program availability and\n97\nactivity increase. (Stipulated testimony of Warden George Sullivan, Warden Dareld Kirby, Warden Eloy\nMondragon and Warden Tom Newton)\n14. The reduction in staffing at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility and Southern New Mexico Correctional\nFacility, coupled with the probable addition of 50 to 100 inmates at each of those facilities, will exacerbate inmate\nactivity problems at those two institutions. (Francke deposition, p. 410)\n15. Reduction in security staff positions will prevent the Corrections Department from complying with staff training\nrequirements of the Court's order in Duran v. Anaya. (Francke deposition, p. 412)\n\n16. The Corrections Department requested an increase of 27 security positions at Western New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility for Fiscal Year 75. According to the Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department,\n\"We simply don't have enough people over there to reach all the posts that we feel are necessary for good\nsecurity.\" Certain priority security posts at Western New Mexico Correctional Facility are not covered at this time.\n(Francke deposition, p. 415; Exhibit 21 pp. 764, 767)\n17. On February 18, 1986, the Secretary of the New Mexico Corrections Department made the following written\nstatements to Governor Toney Anaya concerning proposed reductions in security staff:\nThe loss of security ... staff is compounded by the fact that our growth pattern for the next year will\nrequire us to use the day rooms for nearly 200 inmates by the end of FY75. The crowded\nconditions and increased tension will be dealt with by a reduced staff. (Exhibit 22, p. 3)\nIt seems that the only adequate lobbying component for corrections is a combination of blood and\nfire. To overcrowd Southern and Central on purpose with PNM-South standing vacant is\nunreasonable. To reduce the security staff and increase inmate idleness at the same time borders\non the irresponsible. There will probably be people hurt and some may be killed during the coming\nyear as these historically tranquil facilities react to these steps. (Exhibit 22, p. 3)\nWe do not have adequate staff at Western and PNM-North. The failure to add sufficient staff to\nthese activities will impair our effectiveness and make the facilities more dangerous for inmates\nand staff alike. (Exhibit 22, p. 3)\nSafety is going to take a significant drop as we lose security staff, idle more inmates and\novercrowd the prisons. (Exhibit 22, p. 3)\nJudge Burciaga will either act to restore the staffing cuts, order us to reduce population to match\nour resources or let the whole thing slide. If he does either of the first two we will be vindicated. If\nnot, we can at least be confident that the decree will not be a management headache in the future,\neven if our prisons do regress. If this is the case, I will not envy the Secretary of Corrections his\nability to discard the decree while he watches the toll of the inevitable disturbances rise. (Exhibit\n22, p. 3)\n524  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n*524\n1. The Eighth Amendment is intended to protect and safeguard a prison inmate from an environment where\ndegeneration is probable and self-improvement unlikely because of the conditions existing which inflict needless\nsuffering, whether physical or mental. Battle v. Anderson, 564 F.2d 388, 393 (10th Cir.1977).\n2. Personal safety and medical care are core areas in any Eighth Amendment claim. Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d\n559, 566 (10th Cir.1980).\n3. A prisoner has a right to be reasonably protected from constant threats of violence and sexual assaults from\nother inmates. The failure to provide an adequate level of security staffing, which may significantly reduce the risk\nof such violence and assaults, constitutes deliberate indifference to the legitimate safety needs of prisoners. \nRamos v. Lamm, supra, 639 F.2d at 572-73.\n4. Defendants have a constitutional obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by\nincarceration. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).\n5. Defendants have a constitutional obligation to make available to prisoners a level of medical care that is\nreasonably designed to meet the routine and emergency health care needs of prisoners. This includes medical\ntreatment for inmates' physical ills, dental care and psychological or psychiatric care. Ramos v. Lamm, supra, 639\nF.2d at 574.\n\n6. Only deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners violates the Eighth Amendment proscription\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment. Consequently, accidental or inadvertent failure to provide adequate\nmedical care, or negligent diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition do not constitute a medical wrong under\nthe Eighth Amendment. Estelle v. Gamble, supra, 429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. at 292.\n7. A medical need is \"serious\" if it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one\nthat is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention. Laaman v.\nHelgemoe, 437 F.Supp. 269, 311 (D.N.H.1977).\n8. Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs is shown when prison officials have prevented an inmate from\nreceiving recommended treatment or when an inmate is denied access to medical personnel capable of\nevaluating the need for treatment. Inmates of Allegheny Cty. Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754, 762 (3d Cir. 1979).\n9. Gross deficiencies in staffing establish deliberate indifference to prisoners' health needs. Ramos v. Lamm,\nsupra, 639 F.2d at 575.\n10. The function of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a final determination of the\nrights of the parties. Penn v. San Juan Hospital, Inc., 528 F.2d 1181, 1185 (10th Cir.1975); Continental Oil Co. v.\nFrontier Refining Co., 338 F.2d 780, 781 (10th Cir.1964).\n11. In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must establish (1) substantial likelihood that the\nmovant will eventually prevail on the merits; (2) a showing that the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the\ninjunction issues; (3) proof that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed\ninjunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) a showing that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to\nthe public interest. Lundgrin v. Claytor, 619 F.2d 61, 63 (10th Cir.1980). Plaintiffs have met this burden with\nrespect to proposed medical, mental health and security staffing reductions.\n12. A showing that the remedy at law is inadequate to correct constitutional violations is a prerequisite to\nequitable relief in the form of an injunction. Thus, plaintiffs must establish that coercive sanctions obtained\n525 through a civil contempt proceeding will be inadequate to protect their constitutional *525 rights. Newman v. State\nof Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir.1982). They have done so with respect to proposed medical, mental\nhealth and security staffing reductions.\n13. Lack of financing is not a defense to a failure to provide minimum constitutional standards. Jackson v. Bishop,\n404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir.1968).\n14. The fact that a court's equitable remedies implicate state funds is no bar to the court's exercise of its\nequitable powers. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2573, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); Milliken v.\nBradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2761, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 668,\n94 S.Ct. 1347, 1358, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).\n15. In the exercise of its equitable powers to protect constitutional rights a court may restrict the sources from\nwhich monies are to be paid or transferred in order to protect the legal rights of those who have been victims of\nunconstitutional conduct. United States v. Board of School Commissioners of City of Indianapolis, 677 F.2d 1185,\n1189-90 (7th Cir. 1982).\nDISCUSSION\nA careful review of the relevant facts and controlling principles of law, as set forth above, has convinced the Court\nthat a temporary injunction must issue granting some, but not all, the relief sought by plaintiffs in their motion. The\nareas affected by the proposed staffing reductions occasioned by the Corrections Department's Fiscal Year 75\nbudget constitute the core areas of any Eighth Amendment claim. Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 566 (10th\nCir.1980). Moreover, the proposed staffing reductions are substantial in nature. Even after retaining 19.6\nunauthorized medical positions on a temporary or contract basis, on July 1, 1986 the Corrections Department will\nlose one of every five medical positions authorized in Fiscal Year 74. The effects of reductions in mental health\n\nstaff are even more dramatic. More than one-third of the positions authorized in Fiscal Year 74 will be lost in\nFiscal Year 75. When 36 correctional security positions are subtracted from existing authorized complements at\nthe Penitentiary of New Mexico, Central New Mexico Correctional Facility and Southern New Mexico Correctional\nFacility, the minimal level of security staffing required to provide reasonable security and safety for prisoners and\nstaff will not be met at any of those institutions. The same will be true at Western New Mexico Correctional\nFacility in spite of the addition of eight correctional officer positions.\nAs a result of the reductions projected to occur on July 1, 1986, defendants will be unable to meet their\nconstitutional obligation to provide a level of medical care that is reasonably designed to meet the routine and\nemergency health care needs of prisoners. This will be true with respect to medical care, dental care and\npsychiatric care. By implementing drastic reductions in the number of medical and mental health professionals\navailable to treat prisoners, defendants will deny prisoners access to medical personnel capable of evaluating the\nneed for treatment and providing necessary medical care. Inmates of Allegheny Cty Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754,\n762 (3d Cir. 1979); Ramos v. Lamm, supra, 639 F.2d at 575. By reducing the level of security staffing below the\nminimal safety level recommended by the Court's expert consultant on security staffing, and below the level\nfound by the Special Master and approved as necessary by the Court without objection from either party,\ndefendants are significantly increasing the risk of violence and assaults and thus are evidencing deliberate\nindifference to the legitimate safety needs of prisoners. Ramos v. Lamm, supra, 639 F.2d at 572-73.\nIt is apparent that the medical and psychiatric needs of prisoners that will go unmet if proposed staffing\nreductions are implemented are serious ones. Unnecessary deaths, physical trauma, suicides and self-mutilation\n526 are virtually inevitable. Both *526 plaintiffs' and defendants' experts have testified that the impact of the proposed\nstaffing reductions will make the delivery of satisfactory routine and emergent medical care impossible. As a\nresult, prisoners will endure an unnecessary level of pain and suffering and will be the victims of irreparable\nphysical and mental injury. In summary, the proposed staffing reductions in the medical and mental health areas\nreflect deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners in the four institutions under the Court's\njurisdiction in this cause. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).\nThe evidence before the Court makes it abundantly clear that the Secretary of Corrections has attempted to\npersuade both the New Mexico Legislature and the Governor of New Mexico (the latter being a defendant in this\naction) to make sufficient funds available to avoid the dangerous and life threatening reductions in medical,\nmental health and security staff that are imminent. These efforts thus far have been to no avail. Nonetheless,\ndefendants' constitutional obligations may not be avoided for lack of financing. Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571,\n580 (8th Cir.1968). Moreover, this Court's exercise of its equitable powers is not limited by the fact that needed\nequitable remedies implicate state funds. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); \nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2761, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977).\nTurning to the criteria that must be met for the issuance of a preliminary injunction, the Court finds that there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that plaintiffs eventually will prevail on the merits in upcoming hearings on plaintiffs'\ncontempt motion and the parties' cross motions for modification insofar as those motions relate to medical,\nmental health and security staffing. There is no evidence before the Court that staffing reductions of the\nmagnitude contemplated in the medical and mental health areas will permit the maintenance of minimal\nconstitutional standards in these areas. Indeed, the Court's expert, plaintiffs' expert, defendants' expert and the\nNew Mexico Secretary of Corrections all have testified to the contrary. Particularly in view of the steady increase\nin the penal population that will occur in New Mexico's incarcerated population, deficiencies outlined in earlier\nreports of the Special Master and in testimony before the Court in connection with the pending motion for\npreliminary injunction no doubt will be exacerbated. Likewise, the consistent evidence before the Court is that the\nlevel of psychiatric care being provided at this time, particularly to prisoners in need of acute care, is\nunacceptable by any conceivable measure or standard. All expert testimony is in agreement that the magnitude\nof mental health staffing reductions contemplated will eliminate essential mental health services. On the subject\nof security staffing, there is no credible evidence to contradict the expert assessment that minimal security\nstaffing levels needed to provide a reasonably safe and secure environment for prisoners cannot be achieved if\nthe contemplated reductions in security staffing occur. Even the conclusory statements of the four New Mexico\nwardens in their stipulated testimony that reduced security staffing levels will provide inmates with reasonable\nprotection (assertions contradicted by the Secretary of Corrections) are conditioned on the continuation of current\n\nlevels of inmate program availability and activity. The Secretary of Corrections himself has testified that such\ncontinuation is inconsistent with reductions in security staffing. In summary, plaintiffs have established a\nsubstantial likelihood that they eventually will prevail on the merits on the issues of medical, mental health and\nsecurity staffing.\nThe Court is convinced beyond any doubt and finds that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury unless a preliminary\ninjunction issues at this time. The medical and mental health programs currently in place will deteriorate rapidly if\nprojected staffing cuts are implemented. The rebuilding of these programs, which are deficient even now in a\nnumber of important respects, is predicted by the Secretary of Corrections to require perhaps years of effort.\n527 Death, *527 extreme pain, self-mutilation and the other consequences of medical and mental health staffing\nreductions in evidence before the Court constitute irreparable injury in the most extreme sense of that term.\nLikewise, the prospect of increased rates of physical assault, rape and other forms of violence, testified to with\nalmost complete certainty by the Secretary of Corrections, cannot be regarded as causing less than irreparable\nharm. The issues of the adequacy of the levels of medical, mental health and security staffing are matters of life\n[1]\nand death, and not of mere trivial inconvenience, to prisoners within the New Mexico Corrections Department.\nA preliminary injunction prohibiting the implementation of staffing reductions on July 1, 1986 will create little if any\ndamage to defendants. The plenary hearing on plaintiffs' contempt motion and the parties' cross motions for\nmodification will provide a final resolution of the staffing issues before the Court at this time. In the unlikely event\ndefendants ultimately should prevail on the merits on these issues, additional expenditures incurred between now\nand the time of a final resolution are not likely to be so great that they cannot be recouped to a large extent\nbefore the end of Fiscal Year 75. In any event, the preservation of human life and the protection of prisoners from\nviolent assault and the agonies of acute physical or mental illness outweigh any monetary damage that\ndefendants may suffer as the result of the issuance of this preliminary injunction.\nParticularly in the State of New Mexico, which in 1980 suffered the bloodiest prison riot in the history of American\ncorrections, it should be obvious that the public interest is served by the issuance of a preliminary injunction\nprohibiting defendants from reducing medical, mental health and security staffing to such an extent that the\nminimal constitutional rights of prisoners in maximum security and medium security institutions cannot be met.\nRespect for law, particularly by officials responsible for the administration of the State's correctional system, is in\nitself a matter of the highest public interest. The public at large is not served by unnecessary deaths and serious\ninjuries, or by the willful or wanton infliction of pain and suffering on prisoners; nor is that interest served by the\ndeterioration and dismantling of medical and mental health systems, or by the resultant increase in tension and\nfrustration within institutions without adequate security staff to provide the most minimal level of safety and\nsecurity to prisoners and staff.\nIn summary, perhaps Secretary Francke was correct when he stated, \"It seems that the only adequate lobbying\ncomponent for corrections is a combination of blood and fire.\" An eruption of blood and fire is a danger in any\nprison. To the extent of its ability and power, however, this Court will not permit that deadly combination to result\nfrom flagrant and transparent violations of the constitutional rights of prisoners in New Mexico's correctional\n[2]\ninstitutions.\n528 *528 Although it is clear that plaintiffs are entitled to some relief at this time, they are not entitled to all elements of\nrelief sought in their motion. The Court declines to prohibit staff reductions other than those relating to medical\ncare, mental health care and security, as there is no evidence before the Court at this time that any such\nproposed reductions will adversely affect the minimal constitutional rights of prisoners. For the same reason, the\nCourt refuses to order the rescission of any directive requiring an additional 2% reduction in the budget of the\nNew Mexico Department of Corrections for Fiscal Year 75 or to enjoin any further reductions in the Department's\nbudget. Any such budget reductions as may occur, however, will not be permitted to result in the unconstitutional\nreduction of the levels of medical, mental health or security staffing. Furthermore, it is not necessary at this time\nfor the Court to order, in the alternative, the closing of any correctional institution in New Mexico. If necessary, a\ncoercive remedy obtained through a civil contempt proceeding may well be sufficient to enforce the Court's\npreliminary injunction. Thus, a closure order, even in the alternative, appears at this time to be premature. \n[3]\nNewman v. State of Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312 (11th Cir.1982).  Finally, the Court will not enjoin defendants to\nclose dormitories at the Penitentiary of New Mexico in accordance with the stipulation and order entered on April\n\n20, 1984. This matter is more properly addressed in the pending hearing on plaintiffs' contempt motion and will\nbe reserved until that time.\nAn appropriate order shall be entered herewith.\nORDER GRANTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nThe Court having entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in a Memorandum Opinion filed on this date,\nand upon careful review of the relevant facts and controlling principles of law relating to plaintiffs' motion for a\npreliminary injunction,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that defendants, their officers, agents, servants,\nemployees and attorneys, and those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual\nnotice of this order by personal service or otherwise, are hereby ENJOINED to\na. refrain from eliminating any medical, mental health or security staff position, and from laying off for budgetary\nreasons (as opposed to terminating for cause) any employee currently filling any such position, that was\nauthorized or temporarily approved for Fiscal Year 74 at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, Western New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility, Central New Mexico Correctional Facility and Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility;\nb. proceed forth to fill all vacant medical, mental health and security staff positions at the Penitentiary of New\nMexico, Western New Mexico Correctional Facility, Central New Mexico Correctional Facility and Southern New\nMexico Correctional Facility in order to bring the staff complements in these areas at these institutions to the\nlevels authorized or temporarily approved during Fiscal Year 74; in addition to filling all such vacant positions at\nWestern New Mexico Correctional Facility, proceed promptly after July 1, 1986 to employ the eight additional\ncorrectional officers authorized for that institution by the New Mexico Legislature for Fiscal Year 75;\nc. to refrain, in the course of effecting compliance with subparagraphs A and B above, from transferring funds\n529 from other areas of the Corrections Department's budget in such a manner or to such an extent *529 that\nmembers of the plaintiff class will be deprived of any right to which they are entitled under the provisions of the\nconsent decree or any other remedial order in this cause.\nAll other relief sought by plaintiffs in their motion for a preliminary injunction should be, and hereby is DENIED.\n[1] Subsequent to the filing of the Special Master's nineteenth report, the Court's expert consultant on security\nstaffing reassessed security staffing levels at the Penitentiary of New Mexico. This reassessment was occasioned\nby the imminent opening of the North Facility and the closure or reallocation of certain housing units in the Main\nFacility at PNM. The expert consultant, Mr. C.W. Beaver, submitted a report of his findings and recommendations\non September 5, 1985. That report contains the consultant's recommendations regarding minimal security\nstaffing levels required at the Penitentiary of New Mexico00Main Facility and the Penitentiary of New\n97\nMexico00North Facility to provide a reasonably safe and secure environment for prisoners confined in those\n97\nfacilities. Mr. Beaver's recommendations, which amend those relating to the Penitentiary of New Mexico\ncontained in the Special Master's second report, were filed by plaintiffs in connection with their motion for\npreliminary injunction as Exhibit 6 to the February 1986 deposition of PNM Warden George Sullivan.\n[1] Mr. Beaver's testimony concerning the number of correctional officers employed is consistent with the\nunobjected to finding in the Special Master's twentieth report that the authorized correctional complement at\nWNMCF was 127 during Fiscal Year 74. See Twentieth Report, pp. 6-7 and fn. 5. It is inconsistent however, with\nthe number (175) set forth in Exhibit B to Stipulated Finding No. 11. Exhibit B appears to reflect an error and is\nnot credited by the Court. See also Finding 16, infra, which provides additional support to the Court's resolution of\nthe factual conflict in the evidence concerning the authorized complement of security staff at Western New\nMexico Correctional Facility during Fiscal Year 74.\n[1] It is clear that plaintiffs' remedy at law, coercive sanctions obtained through a civil contempt proceeding, will\nbe inadequate to protect their constitutional rights. Newman v. State of Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312 (11th Cir.1982).\n\nAlthough plaintiffs' motion for contempt is pending, it will not be heard by the Court for several months. In the\nmeantime, New Mexico prisoners would suffer irreparable harm if the staffing reductions were implemented\ncommencing July 1, 1986. Moreover, the Court finds that the medical and mental health systems in place at this\ntime would be seriously deteriorated and effectively dismantled by the time a final ruling on the merits could be\nmade.\n[2] In this connection, the Court notes the opinion of the Corrections Department's Director of Administrative\nServices that the reduction in the Department's budget was a punitive response to the consent decree entered in\nthis case. John Kormanik testified, \"My opinion is that the Legislature basically did not agree and has not agreed\nwith the notion of a negotiated Consent Decree, and that they believe that the best way to make a point with the\nexecutive department, and specifically with the Department of Corrections as well as the federal courts, was to\nappropriate funds at a level that it would be very difficult, if possible00if not impossible, to meet those negotiated\n97\nelements of the Consent Decree.\" (Kormanik deposition, p. 24) One legislator is reported to have remarked that\n\"perhaps this appropriation would send a message to the federal judge that one appointed federal judge could\nnot tell the Legislature of New Mexico how to run its business.\" (Kormanik deposition, p. 25) If Mr. Kormanik's\ntestimony captures the level of the Legislature's sense of responsibility toward the State's correctional system,\nprisoners and free citizens, the lessons of 1980 indeed appear to have been short lived.\n[3] Of course, defendants, if they wish to do so, are free to close one or more institutions to reduce the levels of\nmedical, mental health and security staffing needed on a system-wide basis.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Apodaca  ,, -'.,_. ! .  - ^T c\nl l l l l i ni  n c r\nPC-NM-001-024\n/•.-..  .->c ;••' •?•;\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,  )\nv.  •  )  Civil No. 77-0721-JB\nBRUCE KING, et al.,  )\nDefendants.  )\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nWhereas on August 8, 1990 and October 3, 1990,\nthe Court ordered the parties to enter into negotiations\nin an effort to resolve plaintiffs' pending contempt\nmotions and any other pending motions by either party, to\naddress any proposals that defendants might have for\nmodification of existing orders, and to address the\nultimate termination of auditing and reporting by the\nSpecial Master and of the Court's active supervision of\nits remedial orders in this cause, the parties hereby\nenter into this Settlement Agreement on this l®~ day of\nJune 1991.\n\nI.  DEFINITIONS\nA.  \"Existing Facility\" shall mean any facility which\nis in existence on the Effective Date of this Settlement\nAgreement.\nB.  \"Newly Constructed Facility\" shall mean any\nfacility which is completed after the effective date of\nthis Settlement Agreement and shall include additions to\nan Existing Facility.\nC.  \"Effective Date of this Settlement Agreement\"\nshall mean the date upon which the Court enters an order\napproving this Settlement Agreement.\nD.  \"Decree\" shall mean the the Order of the Court\nentered on July 14, 1980, the Agreement of the parties\napproved by that Order, the policy statements attached\nthereto and the partial consent decrees and agreements\nreferenced therein, as modified by order of the Court\nprior to the Effective Date of this Settlement Agreement.\nE.  \"Modified Decree\" shall mean the Decree, as\nmodified by this Settlement Agreement and by Exhibits B\nand C attached to this Settlement Agreement.\nII. RESTRICTIONS ON OVERCROWDING\nA.  i.  Areas, including dayrooms, not designed for\nhousing prisoners may be utilized for the housing of\nprisoners only as provided in this Settlement Agreement.\n-2-\n\nJUN 17 '91 15=20 NATHh  ROBERTS\nii.  The parties agree that housing prisoners in\ndayrooms that were not originally designed as housing\nareas does not constitute an appropriate long-term\nsolution to overcrowding.  However, from time to time,\ndefendants may need to place prisoners in dayrooms on a\ntemporary basis to accommodate increasing population\nlevels while other alternatives are developed.  In those\ncircumstances, defendants may house prisoners in dayroom\nareas in Existing Facilities, except that no prisoner may\nbe assigned to dayrooms in the S-Unit and the B and C\nBuildings at Western New Mexico Correctional Facility\n(WNMCF).  Any use of dayrooms in Existing Facilities shall\nbe subject to the provisions of Section IIB.l-6.\nB.  Defendants may house no more than 300 prisoners\nin dayrooms in Existing Facilities, including the\nReception and Diagnostic Center and the New Mexico Women's\nCorrectional Facility (NWWCF), if the following conditions\nare ntti\n1.  When a need arises for prisoners to be\nhoused in any dayroom, if vacancies exist at any minimum\nor medium security facility, defendants shall make\nconscientious tfforti through tht application of existing\nclassification procedures to identify medium security\nprisoners eligible for reolassification and reassignment\n-3-\n\nto minimum security facilities or reassignment to other\nmedium security facilities where non-dayroom beds are\navailable.  In order to accomplish this objective,\ndefendants shall notify caseworkers in all medium security\nfacilities of the need to evaluate likely candidates for\nreclassification and reassignment as promptly as possible,\nconsistent with the normal and efficient operation of the\nclassification process.\n2.  Only dayrooms in general population medium\nsecurity housing units are utilized to house prisoners;\nprovided, however, that dayrooms in the Reception and\nDiagnostic Center may be used to house prisoners whose\npreliminary classification review by someone trained in\nclassification procedures indicates that those prisoners\ncan be housed appropriately in a dayroom setting.  The\nreview referred to immediately above shall consist, at a\nminimum, of (a) the assignment of the prisoner to a cell\nfor a period of at least three days prior to the\nprisoner's assignment to a dayroom, (b) an opportunity for\nthe prisoner to meet privately with the classification\nperson to discuss any concerns the prisoner may have\nconcerning the prisoner's possible assignment to a\ndayroom, and (c) a documented preliminary determination\nthat the prisoner can be housed appropriately in a dayroom.\n-4-\n\n3.  No more than five prisoners per dayroom are\nassigned to dayrooms; provided, however, that no more than\neight prisoners per dayroom are assigned to dayrooms at\nNMWCF.\n4.  One cell in any pod in which prisoners are\nplaced in the dayroom is vacated so that the hygiene\nfacilities in that cell are available for use by prisoners\nassigned to the dayroom.  This provision shall not apply\nif the prisoners in the dayroom have direct access without\nassistance from a staff member to suitable hygiene\nfacilities at all times.\n5.  No individual prisoner is housed in a\ndayroom for more than 120 consecutive days.\n6.  No general population prisoner classified as\nmaximum or close custody is assigned to a dayroom.\nC.  Defendants may house prisoners in dayrooms in any\nNewly Constructed Facility provided the following\nconditions are met:\n1.  The defendants may not seek to house more\nthan 120% of design capacity at a particular facility or a\ntotal of more than 500 prisoners for the entire system\n(including Existing Facilities) in dayrooms, whichever\nnumber is smaller.\n-5-\n\n2.  The resulting dayroom housing must provide a\nminimum of sixty square feet of combined living and\nsleeping space for each prisoner housed in the dayroom, as\nwell as a reasonable amount of activity space for the\nother prisoners assigned to that housing unit.\n3.  Except for Section IIB.3, the conditions in\nSection II.B are applicable to the use of any dayroom in a\nNewly Constructed Facility.\nD.  It is the parties' intention that any use of\ndayrooms extend for no longer than is reasonably\nnecessary.  Whenever defendants house prisoners in\ndayrooms pursuant to this Settlement Agreement, defendants\nshall prepare a written plan to periodically eliminate the\nuse of dayrooms and shall share that plan with plaintiffs'\ncounsel.\nE.  Plaintiffs agree not to move the Court to modify\nthe provisions of this Settlement Agreement pertaining to\ndayroom use for five years from the Effective Date of this\nSettlement Agreement, and also agree that they will not,\nat any time, request the Court to entirely prohibit\ndayroom use for housing prisoners.  Defendants agree not\nto move the Court to modify the provisions of this\nSettlement Agreement pertaining to dayroom use for five\nyears from the Effective Date of this Settlement Agreement.\n-6-\n\nF.  i.  Except as provided in Paragraph G of this\nSection II, defendants agree that they will not assign\nmore than one prisoner to a cell in Existing Facilities.\nDefendants may assign two prisoners to a cell in Newly\nConstructed Facilities if that cell contains at least\nsixty square feet per prisoner, and such cells must allow\nprisoners direct access to hygiene facilities without\nassistance from a staff member.\nii.  Except as provided in Paragraph F.iii,\ndefendants shall not move any court to modify paragraph\nF.i.  Defendants shall assert no change of law or change\nof conditions, anticipated or unanticipated, or any other\ngrounds as a basis for modification and declare their\nintention to bind themselves in perpetuity to this\npromise.  Paragraph F.i shall be enforceable in any\nfederal or state court of competent jurisdiction.  In\naddition, Paragraph F.i shall be specifically enforceable\nunder New Mexico law in the courts of the State of New\nMexico as a binding contractual agreement.\niii. Prior to the time when the Modified Decree\nis vacated, if delays in achieving the goal of vacating\nthe Modified Decree in a timely manner are caused\nprimarily by the bad faith action of plaintiffs' counsel,\ndefendants may move the court to modify the provisions of\nParagraph F.i.\n-7-\n\niv.  Defendants also agree that any multiple\noccupancy rooms or dormitories used for the housing of\nprisoners shall provide each occupant at least sixty\nsquare feet of combined living and sleeping space.\nG.  Pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph G,\nrooms located in the S-Unit at WNMCF may be used for  12-0 sf- re-\ndouble occupancy housing.  Because these rooms do not\ncontain toilets or lavatories, however, doors to these\nrooms must remain unlocked by security staff at all times\nunless (1) a bona fide emergency exists requiring that one\nor more doors be locked or (2) an occupant requests that\nhis door be locked.  In the latter event, special care\nshall be taken to unlock the door promptly whenever the\noccupant of a locked room requests that the door to his\nroom be unlocked.\nH.  The definition of substantial compliance in the\nModified Decree, as set forth in Exhibit C attached\nhereto, shall apply to defendants' compliance with\nSection II of this Settlement Agreement, except as\notherwise provided in this Paragraph H.  One or more\nprovisions of Section II of this Settlement Agreement may\nbe suspended, but only as follows:\n1.  Any provision establishing population limits\nmay be suspended, even in the absence of an emergency, if\n-8-\n\nthe suspension is temporarily necessary because of actions\nby members of the plaintiff class or if suspensions are\nsporadic or isolated in nature.  In no event shall this\nparagraph authorize suspension of any provision\nestablishing population limits for more than 72\nconsecutive hours.  Any such suspension, including the\nreason therefor, shall be reported to counsel for\nplaintiffs as promptly as is reasonably possible following\nthe commencement of the suspension.\n2.  i. In the event of an emergency that makes\ncompliance with any of the terms of this Settlement\nAgreement impossible, extraordinarily difficult or\ninfeasible, it may be necessary to suspend temporarily,\neven beyond 72 consecutive hours, any provision that\nestablishes population limits of this Settlement\nAgreement.  In such event, the defendants shall formally\ndeclare a state of emergency, and, as soon as practical,\nbut no later than five days after such declaration, notify\ncounsel for plaintiffs of the reasons that justified the\nsuspension of any provision that establishes population\nlimits of this Settlement Agreement.  The defendants shall\nalso notify counsel for plaintiffs of the expected\nduration of the suspension and the plan of the defendants\nto restore full operation of the Settlement Agreement.\n-9-\n\nii. For purposes of this Settlement\nAgreement, an emergency is defined as a circumstance\ncaused by a riot, fire, or similar event not caused\nintentionally by the defendants, their agents, or\nemployees, that makes compliance with the provisions that\nestablish population limits of this Settlement Agreement\ntemporarily impossible, extraordinarily difficult or\ninfeasible.  Construction delays or labor disputes not\ncaused intentionally or reasonably anticipated by the\ndefendants may constitute an emergency, but legislative,\nexecutive, or administrative policy decisions not to\nappropriate funds or allocate resources to the housing of\nprisoners shall not justify the declaration of an\nemergency.  In addition, legislative or judicial decisions\nregarding sentencing shall not justify the declaration of\nan emergency.\niii. In the event that the defendants seek\nto continue suspension of any provision that establishes\npopulation limits of this Settlement Agreement for a\nperiod of time greater than sixty days without the\nagreement of plaintiffs, the defendants may seek the\nCourt's permission to suspend any provision that\nestablishes population limits of this Settlement\nAgreement.  In any such motion, the defendants bear the\nburden of persuasion.\n-10-\n\n3.  If the plaintiffs believe that any\nsuspension of any provision that establishes population\nlimits of this Settlement Agreement or the duration of the\nsuspension is unjustified, unreasonable, or taken in bad\nfaith, they may request appropriate relief from the\nCourt.  In such event, the plaintiffs bear the burden of\npersuasion.\n4.  In no case shall defendants be required to\nrelease any prisoner before the prisoner's sentence is\ncompleted in accordance with applicable law, except upon\norder of the Court.  Defendants shall not be required by\nthe Court to release any prisoner incarcerated for a\nviolent offense before the prisoner's sentence is\ncompleted in accordance with applicable law.\nIII. MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION PROVISIONS\nA.  Certain modifications of the Decree and the Order\nof Reference, upon which the parties have agreed, attached\nhereto as Exhibits A, B and C, shall be submitted to the\nCourt immediately for approval pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 23.\nThe definition of substantial compliance set forth in the\nmodification to the Order of Reference, attached hereto as\nExhibit A, shall apply to all provisions of this\nSection III relating to findings of substantial\ncompliance, the termination of auditing by the Special\nMaster, and the vacation of extant orders.\n-11-\n\nB.  All pending motions by either party shall be\ndismissed.  The plaintiffs' pending contempt motions shall\nbe dismissed.  Any future contempt motions must be based\non conditions claimed to exist at the time the contempt\nmotion is filed.\nC.  The Modified Decree shall be vacated, with the\nexception of the provisions in Sections I, II and IV of\nthis Settlement Agreement, after defendants have\ndemonstrated substantial compliance for each Existing\nFacility and each systemwide issue specified in this\nSettlement Agreement for a reasonable period of time in\nthe manner set forth in this Section III with regard to\nthat facility or issue.  With the exception of Sections I,\nII and. IV of this Settlement Agreement, the Modified\nDecree may be vacated with respect to an Existing Facility\nor systemwide issue when defendants demonstrate\nsubstantial compliance for a reasonable period of time in\nthe manner set forth in this Section III with regard to\nthat facility or issue.\nD.  i.  The Special Master shall recommend a\nschedule for auditing all Existing Facilities.  The\nschedule may provide for abbreviated auditing at Central\nNew Mexico Correctional Facility, Southern New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility, and WNMCF.  These abbreviated\n-12-\n\naudits shall be completed by October 1, 1991.  In the\nevent that the Special Master makes a recommended finding\nthat any of these facilities has achieved substantial\ncompliance with the Modified Decree, the Special Master\nshall recommend a period of self-monitoring and\nself-reporting for that facility.  In no event shall such\nperiod be shorter than six months or longer than one\nyear.  If during such period of self-monitoring and\nself-reporting the facility remains in substantial\ncompliance, at the end of the period of self-monitoring\nand self-reporting, the Modified Decree shall be vacated\nwith respect to that facility, except that such facility\nshall remain subject to the provisions of Sections I, II\nand IV of this Settlement Agreement.\nii. The Special Master shall also complete a\nfull audit of NMWCF by December 31, 1991 and shall conduct\nperiodic audits of the Penitentiary of New Mexico (PNM)\n(including PNM-Main, PNM-North, and PNM-South) commencing\nJanuary 1, 1992.  In the event that the Special Master\nmakes a recommendation that any of these facilities has\nachieved substantial compliance with the Decree —  and in\nthe case of NMWCF, the order in Klatt v. King, Cause No.\nCiv. 80-871 (JB) —  the Special Master shall recommend a\nperiod of self-monitoring and self-reporting for the\n-13-\n\nfacility.  The period of self-monitoring and\nself-reporting shall not exceed one year for NMWCF and two\nyears for PNM-Main, PNM-North, or PNM-South.  If during\nthe period of self-monitoring and self-reporting, the\nfacility remains in substantial compliance, at the end of\nthe period, the Modified Decree —  and in the case of\nNMWCF, the order in Klatt —  shall be vacated with respect\nto that facility, except that the facility shall remain\nsubject to the provisions of Sections I, II and IV of this\nSettlement Agreement.\niii. Notwithstanding the above schedule with\nreference to PNM, if the defendants obtain American\nCorrectional Association accreditation for PNM prior to\nthe time that the Special Master makes a recommendation\nthat PNM has achieved substantial compliance, the Special\nMaster shall schedule an audit of PNM as expeditiously as\npossible to determine whether the defendants have achieved\nsubstantial compliance.\nE.  i.  Several areas to be monitored by the Special\nMaster are deemed to be systemwide issues.  These include\ndisciplinary and classification appeals and issues\nrelating to access to courts, medical care, and mental\nhealth care.\n-14-\n\nii.  As quickly as possible following the\nEffective Date of this Settlement Agreement, the Special\nMaster shall finalize the pending report on medical care\nthroughout the New Mexico Corrections Department prepared\nby Lambert King, M.D., on February 20, 1991.  Within\nninety days following the Effective Date of this\nSettlement Agreement, defendants shall provide to the\nSpecial Master and plaintiffs' counsel a written plan for\nproviding access to the courts by prisoners in\nadministrative segregation on total lockdown status.\nWithin six months following the Effective Date of this\nSettlement Agreement, the Special Master shall audit\naccess to courts by prisoners in administrative\nsegregation on total lockdown status.  As quickly as\npossible after January 1, 1992, the Special Master shall\naudit defendants' compliance with orders governing\ndisciplinary and classification appeals.  According to a\nschedule to be developed in consultation with counsel for\nall parties, the Special Master shall audit defendants'\ncompliance with the mental health provisions of the\nModified Decree.  This audit shall be limited to the\nfollowing issues:  the appropriate assessment, evaluation,\nand treatment of prisoners requiring acute mental health\ncare; the provision of intermediate level mental health\n-15-\n\ncare to all prisoners requiring such care; the evaluation\nand treatment of prisoners suspected of having an organic\nimpairment or a developmental disability; the provision of\nsex offender treatment to prisoners whose eligibility for\nparole is adversely affected by the unavailability of such\ntreatment or the removal of such requirement from parole\neligibility; the implementation of Vitek procedures when\nthose procedures are required; the defendants' policies\nand practices with respect to minimum custody placement of\nprisoners with mental disorders; the implementation of\nappropriate quality assurance mechanisms; and defendants'\nplanning for the provision of mental health services to\nprisoners as the population within the New Mexico\nDepartment of Corrections increases.  In auditing these\nissues, the Special Master shall not apply any standards\nother than those required by the Modified Decree (that is,\nthose currently required by the Decee, as modified by\nExhibit C attached hereto).\niii. When the Special Master finds substantial\ncompliance as to one or more of the systemwide issues\naddressed in this Paragraph E, he shall recommend a period\nof self-monitoring and self-reporting by defendants with\nrespect to the systemwide issue or issues found to be in\nsubstantial compliance.  This period shall not be shorter\n-16-\n\nthan six months or longer than two years.  If defendants\nremain in substantial compliance during the period of\nself-monitoring and self-reporting, the provisions of the\nModified Decree governing the relevant systemwide issue\nshall be vacated.\nF.  The Special Master shall develop a recommended\nscope and format for self-reporting.  All resulting\nreports shall be filed with the parties and the Court,\nunless the Court approves filing under seal, in which case\nthe reports shall be filed with the Court and provided to\ncounsel for plaintiffs.  The Special Master shall also\nestablish a schedule for re-auditing if any audits\ncontemplated in this Section III do not result in a\nfinding of substantial compliance.\nG.  Any finding or recommendation of the Special\nMaster made pursuant to this Settlement Agreement may be\nchallenged in the manner specified in Section C of the\nOrder of Reference dated June 3, 1983.\nIV. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\nA.  Nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall be\nconstrued to extend the application of the Modified Decree\nto any prisoner other than a prisoner assigned to a\nmedium, close, or maximum security facility.\n-17-\n\nB.  This Settlement Agreement shall not be admissible\nin evidence in any proceeding or trial other than for the\nsole and limited purpose of enforcement of the Modified\nDecree.  Specifically, it is understood and agreed that\nRules 407 and 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence are\napplicable to this Settlement Agreement.\nC.  This Settlement Agreement shall be submitted to\nthe Court for its review and approval pursuant to Rule 23\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nD.  If this Settlement Agreement is approved in its\nentirety by the Court, then:\n1.  This Settlement Agreement and the\nModified Decree constitute the entire agreement of the\nplaintiffs and defendants;\n2.  In the event of any inconsistency or\nambiguity among this Settlement Agreement and the Modified\nDecree, the provisions of this Settlement Agreement shall\ncontrol;\n3.  Only the provisions of Sections I, II\nand IV of this Settlement Agreement shall apply to Newly\nConstructed Facilities; provided, however, that\nSection III shall apply to the extent necessary to enable\nthe Special Master to address systemwide issues; and\n-18-\n\n4.  After the Modified Decree has been\nvacated in its entirety, except for the provisions of\nSections I, II and IV of this Settlement Agreement, as\nprovided in Section III of this Settlement Agreement, then\nSections I, II and IV of this Settlement Agreement shall\nconstitute the entire agreement of the plaintiffs and\ndefendants.\nE.  If this Settlement Agreement is not approved in\nits entirety by the Court, then this Settlement Agreement\nshall be null and void.\nF.  This Settlement Agreement is a document which all\nparties have negotiated and drafted.  Since all parties\nparticipated equally in drafting its terms, the general\nrule of construction interpreting a document against the\ndrafter shall not be applied in future interpretation of\nthis Settlement Agreement.\nAlvin J.

The Special Master shall, at such times as determined\nappropriate, issue reports in accordance with the procedures set\nforth in this Order of Reference, which shall indicate for each of\nthe substantive areas of the Order  (e.g., Classification, Food\nServices, etc.) whether that area  is or is not  in substantial\ncompliance with the Court Order and the basis and reasons for such\nfinding in each area.  If an area is not found to be in substantial\ncompliance it shall be assigned to \"Level 1\".  If an area is found\nto be in substantial compliance it will be assigned to \"Level 2\".\n2.  For purposes  of this Order,  \"substantial  compliance\"\nmeans that defendants generally are in compliance with the terms of\nthe  Court's  remedial  order  as  it  affects  a  particular  area.\nIncidents of non-compliance do not necessarily prevent a finding of\nsubstantial  compliance.  The  determination  of  substantial\ncompliance shall take into account the extent to which exceptions\nto  compliance  are  sporadic  or  isolated  in  nature,  are\nunintentional, are the temporary result of actions by the members\nof the plaintiff class and are promptly and properly addressed by\ncorrective  action  and,  where  appropriate,  disciplinary  action\nagainst staff members responsible for the exception to compliance.\nIn no event shall a determination of substantial compliance be made\n\nif exceptions to compliance are the result of wilful or intentional\nactions by defendants.\n\nEXHIBIT B\nTHE COURT'S REMEDIAL ORDERS\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nRevise  Section 9  of  the  Policy  Statement  regarding\nCorrespondence Regulations (pages 2-3) to read:\n9.  PRIVILEGED CORRESPONDENCE:\nOutgoing  letters  to  attorneys,  recognized  agencies  that\nprovide  legal  assistance,  the  courts,  elected  and  appointed\ngovernmental  officials,  the  news  media,  grand  juries,  law\nenforcement  agents  or  agencies, the  Secretary  of  Corrections,\nCorrections  Commissioners, and the Parole Board  are  considered\nprivileged correspondence and shall not be opened for inspections.\nLetters in this category should be sealed by the inmate and\ndropped in the special box provided for such letters.\nIncoming letters from privileged communicants may be opened,\nbut not read, in the presence of the inmate in an appropriate,\nsecure area  of the institution  by  the warden  or  the warden's\ndesignee to determine if the letters are counterfeit or contain\ncontraband.  A  written  notice  shall  be  prepared  and  the\ncorrespondent  shall be notified by  the warden  or the warden's\ndesignee that the mail was opened and the reason for the opening.\nThe notification to the correspondent shall be signed by the warden\nor the warden's designee.\n\nLIVING CONDITIONS.\nExcept as modified by the Settlement Agreement to which this\nExhibit B is attached, the Policy Statement on Living  Conditions\nremains unchanged.\nCLASSIFICATION.\nRevise  Paragraphs 1-15  of  the  Policy  Statement  on\nClassification as follows:\nA.  Pages 1-2:  Revise Sections 1-4 to read:\n1.  The New Mexico  Corrections  Department  has  the  overall\nresponsibility to receive and classify all inmates committed to its\ncustody.  Following initial classification, further classification\nand  monitoring  of  an  inmate's  progress  shall  be  conducted  as\nappropriate.  Monitoring of the departmental classification system\nshall  be  ongoing  and  shall  be  conducted  by  the  Office  of  the\nDirector of Classification.  As part of this monitoring, defendants\nshall  collect  and  maintain  information  on  the  classification\nprofile of the population of the Department, including information\nrelating to the special needs of inmates.\n2.  A written classification manual shall be maintained, in\nEnglish  and  Spanish,  that  contains  the  policies  which  govern\nclassification and the procedures for implementing those policies.\nThe manual shall be reviewed and revised as needed, but at least\nannually.  Copies of the manual, in English and Spanish, shall be\nmade available to inmates in the law library at each institution,\nand  shall  be  available  to  all  staff.  A  summary  of  the\n\nclassification process shall be included in materials provided to\nthe inmate during the initial classification process.\n3.  Custody classification shall be guided by rational and\nobjective standards derived from specific or general behavioral\ncriteria.  All classification decisions shall be made through the\nclassification process.\n4.  No inmate shall be classified under a more restrictive\ndesignation  than  is  required  by  security  and  custody\nconsiderations.  If an inmate is housed for more than thirty days\nin an institution more secure than indicated by the classification\nsystem  the  inmate  shall  be  afforded,  to  the  maximum  extent\npossible, conditions of confinement similar to those that would\nexist at the indicated institution.  The defendants shall maintain\na record of the reasons for any override of an inmate's custody\ndesignation which  leads to an  increase  in custody  or security\nlevel.\nB.

All classification decisions involving  an increase in\ncustody or security designation, or removal  from a programming\nassignment, shall be made by a committee consisting of at least one\nmember of the program staff and one member of the security staff.\nThe committee  shall solicit information  from the mental health\nstaff when making any decision involving an inmate who is under\ntreatment of that staff.  Notwithstanding this section, the Warden\nat each institution shall have full authority with respect to all\ninstitutional  classification  decisions  relating  to  an  inmate's\nsecurity and custody designation and placement; provided that the\nWarden's decisions shall be in conformity with the provisions of\nthe classification manual; that the Warden shall record in writing\nthe reasons for the decisions; and that the Warden shall have no\nauthority over classification decisions involving assignment to\nmental  health,  medical  or  educational  programs,  except  school\nrelease.

When the inmate is excluded, the reasons for this\n\naction will be stated on the record.  A summary of information\nintroduced in the inmate's absence, excluding any reference that\nwould  identify  confidential  sources, will  be  provided  to  the\ninmate.  During  the  hearing,  the  inmate  shall  be  given  an\nopportunity to respond and shall be provided with reasons for any\nclassification decision affecting the inmate.  Inmates shall be\ncarefully screened upon their commitment to the Department and\nshall be regularly evaluated thereafter.  Inmates may be permitted\nto participate in assessing their needs and in selecting programs\nto meet those needs.  If the classification decision is based, in\nwhole or in part, on consideration of confidential information, the\ninmate shall be given a summary of that information sufficient to\npermit the inmate to challenge the truthfulness of the information\nand its relevance to the classification decision unless the summary\nwould inherently identify the confidential source or pose a threat\nto the security of the institution.\nIf  the  classification  committee  relies  on  confidential\ninformation in making its decision, it shall record at least four\nof the following items so that the reliability of the confidential\ninformation may be reviewed on appeal as necessary:\na.  The  identity  of  the  staff  member  receiving  the\nconfidential information;\nb.  Specific details of any conduct attributed to the inmate;\nc.

Apodaca. means\nany behavior which causes or is reasonably likely to cause acts of\nviolence,  escape,  injury  or death,  substantial  destruction  of\nproperty or a state of emergency as defined in Paragraph 5 of the\nAgreement of the parties.  When  action  is taken based  upon a\nfinding  of  a  threat  to  the  security  of  the  institution,  the\nspecific reason(s) comprising the threat shall be documented.\nB.  Pages 1-3:  Revise Section 3 to read:\n3.  An inmate may be placed involuntarily in administrative\nsegregation through the classification  process pursuant to the\ncriteria stated in one or both of the following two subsections;\nprovided, however, that this provision shall not be used as a basis\nfor  placement  in  administrative  segregation  of  an  inmate  who\ndepartmental mental health professionals have recommended be housed\nother than in administrative segregation:\n10\n\n(a)  According  to  information  reviewed  during  the\nclassification process, the inmate represents a threat to\nthe security of the institution.\n(b)  The  inmate  is  in danger  of bodily  harm  or  other\nviolent acts from himself, herself or other inmates if\nthe  inmate  remains  in  the  general  population,  if  the\ndanger cannot otherwise be eliminated by transfers within\nthe state.\n4.  The ranking shift officer may immediately place an inmate\nin involuntary administrative segregation based upon recent overt\nacts or reliable information which reasonably leads the officer in\ngood  faith  to  believe  that  an  inmate  presents  a threat  to  the\nsecurity  of  the  institution  or  that  the  inmate's  safety  is\njeopardized.  The ranking  shift officer who places an  inmate  in\ninvoluntary  administrative  segregation  under  this  section  shall\ndocument the reasons for the action and shall give a copy of the\ndocument  to  the  inmate  within  one  working  day,  weekends  and\nholidays excluded.  After the initial placement in administrative\nsegregation,  the  action  of  the  ranking  shift  officer  shall  be\nreviewed  for continuation within five working days, weekends  and\nholidays excluded, by the institutional classification committee,\nsubject to approval of the Warden, to determine whether the inmate\nshould remain in administrative segregation.\nC.  Pages 3-5:  Redesignate Sections 4-7 as Sections 5-8 and\nrevise them to read:\n11\n\n5.  The defendants may place an  inmate  in  administrative\nsegregation if the inmate states his or her belief that housing in\nthe general population places the inmate in jeopardy of serious\nbodily harm and requests placement in administrative segregation.\nThe  department  may  immediately  place  an  inmate  in  voluntary\nadministrative segregation pending a hearing in accordance with the\nclassification process, and may accept or reject the request after\nthe hearing.  Pending such a hearing, an inmate housed in voluntary\nadministrative segregation may be denied all congregate activity.\nAn inmate who requests assignment to administrative  segregation\nshall  be  required  to  sign a written  request  slip  stating  the\ninmate's desire for assignment to administrative segregation.\nAny  inmate housed  in voluntary  administrative  segregation\nshall be reclassified from that status within 5 working days-of a\nrequest for reclassification.  However, an inmate who  requests\nreclassification from voluntary administrative segregation may be\nreclassified into involuntary administrative segregation status if\nany of the conditions of Section 3 above is met.\n6.  Except  as  provided  in  Section 4  above,  a  statement\ndetailing  the alleged  specific  facts  and  specific  reasons  for\nclassifying  an inmate  into administrative  segregation  shall be\ngiven to the inmate at least 24 hours prior to the classification\nhearing, including, in the case of an inmate already housed in\nadministrative segregation, the basis for continued placement.  If\nthe basis for placing the inmate into administrative segregation\ninvolves information from a confidential informant, the disclosure\n12\n\nof which would place such informant in jeopardy of serious bodily-\nharm or threaten the security of the institution, the inmate shall\nbe  given  a  summary  of  the  facts  upon  which  administrative\nsegregation classification is being requested sufficient to allow\nthe inmate to challenge the truthfulness of the facts and/or the\nneed for administrative segregation status unless the summary would\ninherently identify the confidential informant or pose a threat to\nthe security of the institution.\nIf the administrative  segregation  classification  committee\nrelies on confidential information in making its decision, it shall\nrecord at least four of the following items so that the reliability\nof the  confidential  information  may  be  reviewed  on  appeal  as\nnecessary:\na.  The  identity  of  the  staff  member  receiving  the\nconfidential information;\nb.  Specific details of any conduct attributed to the inmate;\nc.

The date the information was received;\nh.  What efforts were- made to corroborate the information.\n13\n\n7.  Except as provided in Section 4 above, prior to placing an\ninmate in administrative segregation, a finding must be made under\nthe classification process that the requirements of Section 3 above\nhave been met.  Prior to initial classification of an inmate as\nadministrative  segregation,  the  classification  process  shall\ninclude an assessment of whether other alternatives are available\nand such alternatives and the reasons for rejecting each of them\nshall be documented.  If an inmate is placed in administrative\nsegregation  housing,  the  inmate  shall  be  housed  in  a  single\noccupancy  cell  that  provides  safety  and  comfort  and  shall  be\nallowed to participate in institutional programs as set forth in\nthis section; however, if there is an emergency caused by riot,\nfire or other disaster making living units unusable, two people may\nbe housed  in said  cells  for a period  of short duration while\narrangements are made for alternate housing.\n8.  The classification process shall include a review of the\nstatus of each inmate with reasonable frequency, but at least every\n30 days.  More frequent reviews may be scheduled based  on the\nrequest of the inmate.  At each review, the classification process\nshall  include  determinations  of  the  circumstances  justifying\ncontinued placement in administrative segregation and whether there\nis a substantial basis to indicate that placement in administrative\nsegregation  is warranted  under the criteria  set  forth  in this\norder.  If  not,  the  inmate  shall  be  reclassified  out  of\nadministrative  segregation  status.  The  inmate  shall  be  given\nwritten  notice  of  the  basis  for  continued  placement  in\n14\n\nadministrative  segregation.  The  inmate  shall  be  given  an\nopportunity  to  present  his  or  her  case  regarding  such\nreclassification.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent making\nadditional findings pursuant to the standards and procedures set\nforth above, to the effect that an inmate should continue to be\nclassified in administrative segregation status.\nD.

The defendants shall develop, within 3 0 days of the date\nof this order, criteria for the classification of inmates within\nadministrative  segregation.  The  defendants  shall  develop  and\nmaintain at least two classes of inmates within  administrative\nsegregation.\nClass A  administrative  segregation  inmates  shall  have  an\nopportunity  for group  recreation, group work,  group meals  and\ncontact visiting.  They shall not have group visiting.  Class A\ninmates shall receive educational instruction in their cells.\nClass B administrative segregation inmates shall be considered\nfor group recreation, but shall have no other group privileges.\nGroup recreation for class B inmates may be confined to recreation\nwith selected  inmates from class B.  Class B inmates shall be\nconsidered for contact visits on a case-by-case basis.  If a class\nB inmate is denied contact visiting, the reasons for the denial\nshall be documented.\nAll inmates assigned to administrative segregation, including\npre-trial detainees and death-sentenced inmates, shall be evaluated\n15\n\nfor a period not to exceed thirty days to determine the class to\nwhich the inmate is to be assigned.\nAt the conclusion of the thirty day evaluation process, the\ndefendants  shall  prepare  for  each  inmate  an  Individualized\nTreatment  Plan  (ITP).  The  ITP  shall  provide  for  programming\ndesigned specifically for the inmate.  The total hours of daily\nprogrammed activity for each inmate may be more or less than five\nhours depending on the needs and interests of the inmate; provided,\nhowever, that unless specific circumstances of an inmate require\nless activity, the ITP shall provide the inmate with access to one\nor more of programs, jobs, activities or privileges so that the\ninmate shall be provided the opportunity for at least five hours of\nactivity,  five  days  per week,  exclusive  of  recreation.  Each\ninmate's ITP will be evaluated at least every thirty days.\nThe ITP shall  include a schedule of personal  and  program\nobjectives that shall lead to advancement within the classes of\nadministrative segregation and, ultimately, to reintegration into\nthe general population if the inmate successfully completes those\nobjectives.  However,  if  the  classification  process  includes\ndocumentation  of  reasons  justifying  a  good  faith  belief  that\nreintegration into the general population may expose the inmate to\nbodily harm or other violent acts or may present a threat to the\nsecurity  of  the  institution,  then  reclassification  and\nreintegration are not required.\nFor inmates who have been housed in administrative segregation\nfor more than one year, the Central Classification  Board shall\n16\n\nreview the placement to ensure it is appropriate.  Such  reviews\nshall  be  held  semi-annually.  Moreover,  for  all  such  inmates,\nprogramming  personnel  shall  review  the  inmate's  programming  to\nensure  that  the  inmate  is  provided  the  maximum  degree . of\nprogramming consistent with administrative segregation.\n10.  Every inmate in administrative segregation status shall\nreceive an opportunity seven days a week for a minimum of one hour\nof exercise outside the inmate's cell.  Exercise shall be outdoors\nwhenever weather permits.\n11.  Inmates  who  have  been  classified  as  administrative\nsegregation shall be provided with the following:\n(a)  Clothing  and  linen  issue  and  exchange\nsimilar  to  that  provided  to  the  general\npopulation;\n(b)  Meals provided to the general population;\n(c)  Correspondence  privileges  similar  to\nthose provided to the general population;\n(d)  Showers and shaving five days a week;\n(e)  Hair grooming and barbering;\n(f)  A minimum of two hours visitation per week.\nF.

Inmates in administrative segregation status may retain\ntheir personal property, as permitted in general population as long\nas appropriate  fire, safety, health or sanitation  rules are  not\nviolated,  unless  the  removal  of  specific  designated  items  of\npersonal property is essential to protect the safety of the inmate\n17\n\nor others.  If any of an inmate's personal property is removed\nfrom the inmate's cell to comply with  fire, safety, health  or\nsanitation  rules, defendants  shall  document  the  basis  for  the\nremoval of those papers.  Defendants shall keep an inventory of all\nsuch removed property and the property shall be maintained  in a\nsecure manner that preserves the confidentiality of the papers, or\nthe inmate shall be given the option of sending those papers to a\nperson designated by the inmate, until the problem of compliance\nwith rules has been remedied.\n15.  Inmates in administrative segregation status shall be\nhoused in single occupancy cells or rooms; however, if an emergency\nmakes living units unusable, two people may be housed in said cells\nor rooms for a period of short duration while arrangements are made\nfor alternate housing.  All inmates in administrative segregation\nstatus may have basic items needed for personal hygiene, as well as\nitems such as eyeglasses, dentures and writing material.\n16.  A case manager shall visit at least weekly all areas in\nwhich administrative segregation inmates are housed and shall be\navailable, no less frequently than once per week, to help each\ninmate who desires assistance or information.  A qualified medical\nprofessional shall conduct sick call daily in each administrative\nsegregation living area and shall examine  every  inmate who  so\nrequests to determine what medical care, if any, is required.  A\nlog of all sick call visits shall be maintained.\n17.  A qualified clinical psychologist or psychiatrist shall\nassess  the  status  of each person  classified  as  administrative\n18\n\nsegregation within 3 0 days after placement and at least once every\n90  days  thereafter  to  ensure  that  no  inmate  is  housed  in\nadministrative  segregation  for whom mental health  considerations\nindicate  such  housing  is  inappropriate.  Said  assessment  shall\ninclude a personal interview with the inmate.\n18.  Visitation by religious personnel to inmates classified\nas administrative segregation shall be governed by the terms of the\nvisitation  consent  order  in  Duran v.  Apodaca.  Inmates  in  the\nadministrative  segregation  living  areas  shall  be  provided  with\naccess to appropriate religious services.\n19.

MINOR REPORT DISPOSITION.  Disciplinary authority for\nminor report disposition is delegated to the Disciplinary Officer\nor  the  Disciplinary  Officer's  designee.  When  the  Disciplinary\nOfficer or the Disciplinary Officer's designee receives a report of\ninmate misconduct, the Disciplinary Officer has the authority  to\nimpose minor sanctions, but only in accordance with the procedures\nset  forth  in  paragraph  10  of  this  Policy  Statement  on  Inmate\nDiscipline.  Within  15 days  after  the  decision,  the  inmate  may\nappeal the decision to the warden.  The warden may approve, reduce,\nrefer for further investigation or dismiss.^  The bases for such\nan appeal are as follows:\n(1)  the disciplinary policies were not followed;\n(2)  the  decision  of  the  Disciplinary  Officer  was  not\nbased on evidence;\n(3)  the punishment was excessive; or\n(4)  new evidence or witnesses exist.\n8.  MISCONDUCT  REPORTS.  Informal  resolution  of  minor\nincidents is encouraged.  However, when any employee witnesses any\nact  which  would  constitute  a  major  or  minor  offense,  or  has\nreasonable  belief  that  a  serious  violation  has  occurred,  the\nemployee has a responsibility to prepare a misconduct report.\n-' Material formerly contained  in Sections 6 and 7 of this Policy\nStatement has been modified and incorporated in Exhibit I to this\nPolicy Statement.\n-' The sanctions for minor reports have been moved to Exhibit I.\n22\n\nThe initial misconduct report shall contain the date and\ntime of the violation, the date and time the report was written and\nthe date and time the report was submitted to the shift supervisor\nfor review.  The report shall include the specific rules violated;\na formal statement of the charge; any unusual inmate behavior; any\nstaff  witnesses;  disposition  of  any  physical  evidence;  any\nimmediate  action  taken,  including  the  use  of  force;  and  the\nreporting officer's signature.\nFollowing  the  initial  investigation  by  the  reporting\nemployee, the misconduct report must be submitted for supervisory\nreview and a copy given to the inmate within two working days,\nweekends and holidays excluded, from the date of the incident, or\nthe date when the reporting employee obtains sufficient facts to\njustify  issuing  a  misconduct  report.  Where  additional\ninvestigation time is required by the reporting employee, written\napproval can be obtained from the warden or the warden's designee.\nThe written approval must be obtained in advance of the filing of\nthe report and attached to the report.  The warden, or in the\nwarden's absence the acting warden, may grant extensions for good\ncause  shown,  e.g.,  where  there  is  a  showing  of  extenuating\ncircumstances  such  as  a  perpetrator  is  not  identified;  co-\nconspirators are unidentified; there is a criminal investigation\ncontrolled by other agencies; or in which the inmate requests a\ndelay in order to protect the inmate's right to remain silent; or\nthere  is  a work  stoppage  or group  disturbance  preventing  the\nreview.  In all cases, however, the report shall be provided to the\n23\n\ninmate within two working days, weekends and holidays excluded,\nfrom the date the report is issued.  A dismissal shall be entered\nin cases where  these  time  requirements,  including  appropriate\nextensions, are not met unless the unexcused delay was unavoidable.\nHowever, in the event of a continuing emergency, such as\na riot, which prevents notice and hearing as required, said notice\nand hearing shall be provided as soon as is practical.\nWhenever an incident and/or inmate poses an  immediate\nthreat to employees, inmates or the security of the institution,\nthe shift supervisor and/or other appropriate supervisor must be\nnotified  immediately  by the reporting employee  so that prompt,\nappropriate steps may be taken to control the situation.\nAn inmate may not be placed in disciplinary segregation\nprior to a hearing.  However, if the inmate poses a threat to the\nsecurity of the institution, the inmate may be placed in prehearing\ndetention pending  a disciplinary  hearing  as  if he or she were\nclassified administrative segregation. When such circumstances are\nfound to exist, the officer placing the inmate(s) in prehearing\ndetention  shall document  the reasons and  submit them with  the\nofficer's report to the shift supervisor.  The shift supervisor\nshall  immediately  review  the  report  and  the  circumstances\nsurrounding the incident and determine whether such confinement is\nnecessary.  The shift supervisor who approves placing an inmate in\nprehearing detention under this section shall document the reasons\nfor the action and shall give a copy of the document to the inmate\nwithin one working day, weekends and holidays excluded, after the\n24\n\ndate of lock-down.  The action of the shift supervisor shall be\nreviewed for continuation within three working days, weekends and\nholidays excluded, by the Chief of Security  or in the Chief's\nabsence the acting  Chief of Security  to determine whether  the\ninmate  should  remain  in  prehearing  detention  prior  to  a\ndisciplinary hearing.  The review shall include an interview with\nthe inmate to make certain the inmate has received notice of the\ncharges against him or her-and to provide the inmate an opportunity\nto present his or her views regarding whether the inmate should\nremain in prehearing detention until a disciplinary hearing is\nheld.

Inmates  shall\nreceive a hearing at the first available date, but not\nmore  than  10  working  days,  weekends  and  holidays\nexcluded, after the  Disciplinary  Officer  completes  the\ninvestigation.  A  continuance  may  be  granted  by  the\n29\n\nHearing Officer to either the inmate or the institution\nin  order  to  prepare  their  case  or  where  additional\nevidence is necessary.  An inmate may waive in writing\nhis or her right to 72 hour notice of the disciplinary\nhearing.\n(d) The  inmate may  request the  assistance  of  another\ninmate  or  staff  member  to  assist  in  the  preparation\nand/or presentation of the case.

Inmates are\nnot  entitled  to  be  represented  by  legal  counsel  at\nhearings before the Hearing Officer.  If the inmate being\ncharged  cannot  read  and  write  English  adequately  to\ncomprehend  and defend  the charge, assistance  shall be\nprovided by a person capable of communicating with the\ninmate and the Hearing Officer. Employee representation\nmay not include the Hearing Officer.

When the inmate is excluded, the reasons  for\nthis action shall be stated on the record.  A summary of\nthe  evidence  introduced  in the  absence  of  the  inmate,\nexcluding any reference to confidential sources, shall be\nprovided to the inmate.\n(f) An inmate shall be permitted to make his or her own\nstatement,  to  request  that  the  Hearing  Officer  call\nwitnesses, and to present documents in his or her behalf,\nprovided  that  the  calling  of  witnesses  and/or  the\ndisclosure  of  documentary  evidence  does  not  jeopardize\nthe physical  safety of staff and  inmates.  The  Hearing\nOfficer  shall  call  those  witnesses  requested  by  the\ninmate unless calling  the witness would  interfere  with\nthe  necessary  operations  of  the  institution  or  would\nproduce  only  duplicative  evidence.  The  Hearing  Officer\nmay  accept written  statements  from  those witnesses  not\ncalled  and  may  exclude  witnesses  whose  testimony  is\nirrelevant  or  cumulative.  The  Hearing  Officer  shall\nstate for the record the reasons for excluding witnesses.\nInmate witnesses may be questioned by the Hearing Officer\n31\n\nand, if the Hearing Officer permits, by the inmate or the\ninmate's representative.

Employee  witnesses  shall  not  be\ninterrogated or cross-examined by the inmate.  The inmate\nmay submit to the Hearing Officer written questions to be\nasked of employee witnesses.  The Hearing Officer shall\nask those questions  if the Hearing Officer  determines\nthat doing so may produce relevant evidence, unless the\nHearing Officer concludes that the questions are unduly\nconfrontational, cumulative  or argumentative.  If the\nHearing  Officer  declines  to  ask  employee  witnesses\nquestions submitted by the inmate, the Hearing Officer\nshall state on the record the reason for declining,\n(g)  Where  information  obtained  from  a  confidential,\nreliable  informant is used, the Hearing Officer  shall\nevaluate the reliability of the informant and state on\nthe  record  the  grounds  for  finding  the  informant\nreliable.  The reliability  of the  informant  shall  be\nbased  on:  the  informant  having  provided  reliable\ninformation in the past, the information being offered is\nbased  on  first  hand  observations,  or  there  is\ncorroboration either from another source or through other\nevidence supporting the reliability of the informant's\ninformation.  No inmate shall be found to have committed\n32\n\nthe offense solely on the testimony of a confidential\ninformant.  A  summary  of  confidential  information\nobtained by the Hearing Officer, excluding  identifying\ninformation, shall be given orally to the inmate unless\nthe summary would inherently identify the confidential\nsource  or  pose  a  threat  to  the  security  of  the\ninstitution.\n(h) The Hearing Officer shall prepare a written report of\nthe  evidence,  including  documents,  statements,  and\nphysical evidence which were used as a basis for filing\nthe misconduct report and all the evidence on which the\nHearing Officer based the decision and reasons for the\naction taken.

No. 77-721 KG/KK \n \nSUSANA MARTINEZ, Governor, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \n  This matter comes before the Court upon Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce Settlement \nAgreement and for Order Awarding Attorneys’ Fees and Litigation Expenses (Motion to \nEnforce), filed on January 20, 2017.  (Doc. 2806).  Defendants filed a response on February 3, \n2017, and Plaintiffs filed a reply on February 8, 2017.  (Docs. 2808 and 2810).  Having reviewed \nthe Motion to Enforce and the accompanying briefs, the Court grants the Motion to Enforce, in \npart, and denies it, in part. \nA.  Background \n  In February 2016, Plaintiffs filed Plaintiffs’ Motion for Emergency Declaratory and \nInjunctive Relief, for a Finding of Contempt and for Orders Imposing Coercive and \nCompensatory Remedial Relief (Emergency Motion) regarding the permanent injunction \nprohibiting double-celling.  (Doc. 2727).  In May 2016, the parties settled, in principle, the \ndispute raised in the Emergency Motion.  (Doc. 2760).  On August 31, 2016, the Court granted \nthe parties’ Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement Agreement (Doc. 2766).  (Doc. 2768).  The \nSettlement Agreement provided that “Plaintiffs do not waive any claim for attorneys’ fees \nincurred in connection with the [Emergency Motion]….”  (Doc. 2766-1) at 5, ¶ E. \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2819   Filed 03/17/17   Page 2 of 6\n  Also, on August 31, 2016, Plaintiffs sent to defense counsel a request for payment of \nattorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in prosecuting the Emergency Motion.  (Doc. 2806) at ¶ 5.  \nPlaintiffs state that  \n  [a]fter repeated inquiries about a response to the request for payment, defense counsel \nfinally responded nearly six weeks later, on October 11, 2016, the date they had been \ngiven by [plaintiffs’ counsel] on October 3, 2106 [sic] as the deadline for a response from \nthem before plaintiffs’ counsel would file a motion for attorneys’ fees and expenses \nabsent any response to the request for payment. \n \nId.  Following negotiations, the parties agreed on November 8, 2016, that Defendants would pay \n$29,838.01 in attorneys’ fees and expenses.  Id.; Email exchanges (Doc. 2810-1) at 5-6; Email \nexchanges (Doc. 2810-2).   \n  On November 16, 2016, Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote defense counsel regarding when \nPlaintiffs could expect payment of the attorneys’ fees and expenses.  Email exchanges (Doc. \n2810-1) at 5.  That same day, defense counsel responded that she sent the bill to Jim Brewster \nand Brian Fitzgerald and that she would get back to Plaintiffs’ counsel as soon as she could.  Id. \n  Having heard nothing further from defense counsel Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote defense \ncounsel on November 23, 2016 about the status of the payment.  Id.  Later in the day, defense \ncounsel responded that Brewster was trying to determine if the New Mexico Corrections \nDepartment (NMCD) would the pay the bill or the Risk Management Division (RMD).  Id. at 4.  \nDefense counsel also stated that she would get back to Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Id. \n  Again, not having heard back from defense counsel, Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote defense \ncounsel on December 7, 2016, that if a dispute remains between NMCD and RMD, one of them \nshould pay the bill and then they can later resolve their dispute.  Id.  Plaintiffs’ counsel also \ninformed defense counsel that he would file a motion for enforcement of their agreement “if that \nis what it takes.”  Id.  Later that morning, defense counsel stated that the invoice was submitted \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2819   Filed 03/17/17   Page 3 of 6\nto the “DOC pay master” and that, as soon as she found out, she would let Plaintiffs’ counsel \nknow when to expect the invoice to be processed.  Id. at 3-4.  A week later, defense counsel \nasked for W-9 forms for two of Plaintiffs’ counsel, which they provided that same day.  Id. at 2. \n  On December 19, 2016, Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote defense counsel that it had been almost \ntwo weeks since defense counsel indicated that the invoice was submitted and that he had not \nheard back from her about when to expect the invoice to be processed.  Id. at 3.  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel asked when Plaintiffs could expect a check.  Id.  That day, Defense counsel responded \nshe would inquire with Fitzgerald the next day about the status of the check and let Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel know what the status was.  Id.   \n  Once more, not having heard anything from defense counsel, Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote on \nJanuary 3, 2017, to defense counsel that he would “file a motion to enforce and seek fees and \ncosts including the fees incurred in the efforts” to get “paid over the last several months,” if \npayment was not made by January 12, 2017.  Id. at 2-3.  Defense counsel responded in the \nafternoon that the bill would “be sent to DFA [Department of Finance and Administration] in a \nday or so” along with a justification for payment so that the bill would finally be processed for \npayment.  Id. at 2.  Defense counsel stated that she did not know how long DFA would take to \nreview and pay the bill.  Id.  She further stated, again, that she would keep Plaintiffs’ counsel \nadvised.  Id.   \n  On January 16, 2017, Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote defense counsel that he did not file the \nmotion to enforce and seek attorneys’ fees and expenses on January 12, 2017, based on her \nrepresentation that the bill was being sent to DFA.  Id. at 1.  He also noted that he had not heard \nback from defense counsel regarding whether the bill was, in fact, sent to DFA, when the bill \nwas sent to DFA, or what the processing “turnaround time” would be.  Id. That afternoon, \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2819   Filed 03/17/17   Page 4 of 6\ndefense counsel responded that she was forwarding Plaintiffs’ counsel’s email to Brewster and \nFitzgerald at the Department of Corrections.  Id. \n  Plaintiffs’ counsel, having received no further communications on the status of the bill, \nfiled the Motion to Enforce on January 20, 2017.  (Doc. 2806).  In doing so, Plaintiffs did not \nformally seek Defendants’ concurrence in the Motion to Enforce, but stated that “Plaintiffs \nreasonably believe that due to the nature of this motion, defendants do not concur in it.”  Id. at ¶ \n1.  In their Motion to Enforce, Plaintiffs seek (1) the $29,838.01 for attorneys’ fees and expenses \nincurred in the successful prosecution of the Emergency Motion, and (2) reasonable attorneys’ \nfees incurred in filing the Motion to Enforce.  On February 2, 2017, a day before Defendants \nfiled their response to the Motion to Enforce, DFA approved the payment of the bill and \nPlaintiffs’ counsel were paid $29,838.01.  (Doc. 2808) at ¶¶ 9-12.   \nB.  Discussion \n  Defendants argue first that the Court should summarily deny the Motion to Enforce \nbecause Plaintiff violated D.N.M. LR-Cv 7.1(a).  Local Rule 7.1(a) states that a “[m]ovant must \ndetermine whether a motion is opposed, and a motion that omits recitation of a good-faith \nrequest for concurrence may be summarily denied.”  The purpose of this Local Rule is to prevent \nthe filing of motions which the parties could otherwise resolve without the Court’s intervention. \n  Defendants note, and the Court agrees, that Plaintiffs did not formally request \nDefendants’ concurrence in the Motion to Enforce prior to filing it.  On the other hand, Plaintiffs \ninformed Defendants twice that they intended to file a motion to enforce should Defendants \ndecline to pay the attorneys’ fees and expenses the parties had agreed to.  Despite Plaintiffs’ \nprodding, Defendants did not pay the attorneys’ fees and expenses until after Plaintiffs filed the \nMotion to Enforce.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ communications with defense counsel \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2819   Filed 03/17/17   Page 5 of 6\nsufficiently fulfilled the purpose of Local Rule 7.1(a) by informing Defendants of Plaintiffs’ \nintent to file a motion to enforce and providing Defendants an opportunity to prevent its filing.  \nThe Court will, therefore, not summarily deny the Motion to Enforce on the basis of Local Rule \n7.1(a). \n  Defendants also argue that the Motion to Enforce should be denied as now moot.  The \nCourt agrees that the portion of the Motion to Enforce seeking payment of $29,838.01 for \nattorneys’ fees and expenses associated with successfully prosecuting the Emergency Motion is \nnow moot.  \n  Defendants further contend that they should not pay reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred \nin filing the Motion to Enforce.  First, Defendants argue that they processed the bill in a \nreasonable amount of time considering the DFA process.  Second, Defendants state that “[t]he \ntime between Plaintiffs’ counsels’ last submission of paperwork [i.e., the W-9 forms] and the \ntime of processing payment was weeks not months.”  (Doc. 2808) at ¶ 15.  And third, Defendants \nnote that Plaintiffs set unilateral deadlines for payment which Defendants had not agreed to.  In \nsum, Defendants argue that the Motion to Enforce was unnecessary. \n  A review of the communications between counsel shows the following:  (1)  Plaintiffs \nfirst requested payment of the attorneys’ fees and expenses in August 2016, (2) about three \nmonths later, in early November 2016, the parties agreed to the amount of attorneys’ fees and \nexpenses owed to Plaintiffs, (3) a month later, Defendants submitted the bill to DFA in early \nDecember 2016, (4) Plaintiffs actually received payment of the attorneys’ fees and expenses six \nmonths after they first requested payment of attorneys’ fees and expenses and about three months \nafter the parties settled on the amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses Defendants would pay, (5) \ndefense counsel did not keep Plaintiffs’ counsel apprised of the status of the processing of the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2819   Filed 03/17/17   Page 6 of 6\npayment of the bill, as she repeatedly promised she would, and (6) interestingly, Plaintiffs did \nnot receive payment of the attorneys’ fees and expenses until after they filed the Motion to \nEnforce and just before Defendants filed their response to the Motion to Enforce.  The Motion to \nEnforce is more than justified, based on the lengthy time frames, Defendants’ failure to keep \ntheir promises to inform Plaintiffs of the payment process, and the curious timing of the payment \nof the attorneys’ fees and expenses until after Plaintiffs filed the Motion to Enforce and just \nbefore Defendants filed their response.  Consequently, the Court will award Plaintiffs reasonable \nattorneys’ fees incurred in preparing and filing the Motion to Enforce and the reply to the Motion \nto Enforce.  The Court encourages the parties to settle the issue of these attorneys’ fees promptly, \nbut, if necessary, Plaintiffs can file a motion for an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees no later \nthan 30 days from the date of the entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. \n  IT IS ORDERED that  \n  1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and for Order Awarding \nAttorneys’ Fees and Litigation Expenses (Doc. 2806) is granted in part in that Plaintiffs are \nentitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees for bringing this Motion to Enforce;  \n  2.  if necessary, Plaintiffs have 30 days from the date of the entry of this Memorandum \nOpinion and Order to file a motion for an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in \nbringing this Motion to Enforce;  \n  3.  the parties will follow the Local Rules and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \nbriefing the motion for an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees; and \n  4.  Plaintiffs’ request for $29,838.01 in attorneys’ fees and expenses is denied as moot. \n \n   \n              _______________________________ \n              UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n6 \n ",

Gibson, Plaintiffs,\nv.\nGarrey CARRUTHERS, Governor; Hal Stratton, Attorney General; O. Lane McCotter,\nSecretary of Corrections; Robert Tansey, Warden, PNM; Defendants.\nCiv. No. 77-0721-JB.\nUnited States District Court, D. New Mexico.\nFebruary 11, 1988.\n840 *840 National Prison Project of the ACLU Foundation, Inc. (Elizabeth Alexander, Mark J. Lopez, Alvin J.\nBronstein, on the brief), R. Raymond Twohig, Jr., Albuquerque, N.M., Mark H. Donatelli, Rothstein Law Firm,\nSanta Fe, N.M., for plaintiffs.\nNorman S. Thayer, Sutin, Thayer & Browne, Albuquerque, N.M., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBURCIAGA, District Judge.\nThe defendants in the above-captioned civil action have filed a motion seeking to vacate portions of the consent\n[1]\ndecree approved and entered by this Court in 1980.  As stated in their brief in support of the motion to vacate,\n\"[d]efendants' fundamental contention is that portions of the 1980 decree create rights that are not grounded in\nfederal law and thus cannot be enforced by a federal court.\" Defendants' brief, p. 2. The defendants' motion relies\non the eleventh amendment, and related considerations of comity. The motion has been extensively briefed by\nthe parties, and has been given prolonged and careful attention by the Court. Ultimately, as demonstrated in this\nMemorandum Opinion, the motion rests on the incorrect and unsupported conception of the nature of the\neleventh amendment immunity, and a misapplication of the principle of comity. Although this memorandum may\nseem prosaic and somewhat pedantic, for which the Court apologizes, it is necessary in order to meet the\nextravagant contentions of defendants.\nI. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint.\nOn July 6, 1978, the plaintiff class, through counsel, filed its first amended complaint. The complaint alleges that\n\"the totality of the overcrowding and other conditions at PNM fall beneath standards of human decency, inflict\nneedless suffering on prisoners and create an environment which threatens prisoners' mental and physical well-\n841 being, and results in the physical *841 and mental deterioration and debilitation of the persons confined therein\n[2]\nwhich is both unnecessary and penologically unjustifiable.\" First Amended Complaint, ¶ 1.  This general\nallegation is elaborated upon by extensive factual allegations dealing with a wide range of conditions and\npractices alleged to be in place at the Penitentiary of New Mexico. First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 15-32.\nFollowing this elaboration, the first amended complaint sets forth four claims for relief: first, a claim that the\ntotality of the conditions, alleged in the complaint, violates the federal constitutional rights of the plaintiff class\nsecured by the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution;\n[3]\nthe second and third claims for relief are based on state constitutional and statutory law;  the fourth claim for\nrelief is predicated on the assertion that the plaintiff class is a third-party beneficiary of a contractual arrangement\nbetween the defendants and the United States Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, pursuant to 49\nU.S.C. § 3750.\n\nII. The 1980 Consent Decree and Order.\nAfter extensive pretrial proceedings and negotiations, the parties presented to the Court a comprehensive\nsettlement document entitled Agreement, to which was attached a series of documents labeled policy statements\nrelating to various substantive areas of prison operations. This voluminous document contains mandatory and\nprohibitive injunctions, often of great specificity, relating to a broad range of conditions and practices at the\n[4]\nPenitentiary of New Mexico.\nBy an order dated July 14, 1980, the Court, finding that the agreement represented a compromised settlement of\nthe disputes between the parties, provisionally approved the comprehensive consent judgment. The July 14\norder, which itself was entered by consent, includes standard prefatory language by which the Court\nacknowledged that the defendants disavowed liability and that the parties agreed to limit the admissibility of the\ndocument.\nParagraph 2 of the July 14 order states that the consent decree \"may include specific requirements and\nprocedures beyond what is required by the Constitution of the United States.\" The order provides further for\nredefinition of the plaintiff class \"to include all those inmates who are now, or in the future may be, incarcerated in\nthe Penitentiary of New Mexico at Santa Fe or at any maximum, close or medium security facility opened for\noperation by the state of New Mexico after June 12, 1980.\"\nFinally, the July 14 order directed that notice of the order and settlement be provided to all members of the class,\npursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The July 14 order stated that the Court had\nexamined the agreement and found that it represented a compromise settlement of the disputes of the parties.\n842 Following that review, under Rule 23, the *842 Court gave tentative approval of the decree, stating that its\napproval was \"provisional until fifteen (15) days after said notice.\" The order was to \"become final if not rejected\n[by the Court] or modified by agreement of the parties based upon said objections [from the plaintiff class] within\nthirty (30) days.\"\nPursuant to that provision, the objection process commenced. Two objections from the plaintiff class were\nsubmitted to the Clerk, as mandated by the class notice, but neither objection was sufficient to provoke the\nCourt's rejection of the consent judgment. In the absence of a motion from the parties to modify the judgment, the\nJuly 14 order, approving the consent decree and adopting it as an order of the Court, became final.\nIII. Proceedings Since Entry of the Consent Decree.\nThe litigation did not terminate with entry of the consent judgment and order. Since 1980, extensive activity has\ntaken place within the litigation, including recurrent allegations by the plaintiff class of contumacious conduct on\nthe part of the defendants. In 1983, with the agreement of the parties, the Court appointed a special master and a\ndeputy special master, pursuant to Rule 53, Fed.R.Civ.P., to monitor the state of the defendants' compliance with\nall remedial orders entered in this cause. Order of Reference, June 3, 1983. Since that time, the special master\nhas filed twenty reports on defendants' state of compliance, totaling more than 2,000 pages setting forth findings\nof fact as to the state of defendants' compliance, as well as a volume of over 700 separate findings of fact\nrelating to the state of defendants' compliance as of early 1986. Those reports have provided a factual basis for\nthe entry of numerous orders by the Court approving the special master's findings. Additionally, the parties have\nentered into several stipulations provoked by the findings of the special master and the orders of the Court.\nBecause of the fundamental jurisdictional claim raised in defendants' motion to vacate, this history is not relevant\nto the Court's consideration of that motion. It serves to show, however, that it has provided the Court with a vast\nfactual record in this case which has informed the Court's evaluation of the consent decree in determining the\nfederal constitutional rights of the plaintiff class and the scope of equitable relief required to redress deprivation of\nthose rights.\n\nIV. Defendants' Motion to Vacate.\nA. Prior Motions\nOn June 12, 1987, the defendants filed their motion to vacate portions of the 1980 decree. At the time this motion\nwas filed, defendants' motion to modify the decree, and plaintiffs' motion seeking a finding of contempt against\ndefendants, both of which were filed in December 1985, were pending before the Court. For the purpose of those\npending motions, the Court had compiled, through the efforts of the special master, an extensive factual record\n[5]\ndescribing defendants' state of compliance, as of 1986, with the outstanding remedial orders.  Additionally, in\nDecember 1986, the Court heard extensive testimony relating to the parties' December 1985 motions.\nWhile the 1985 motions were pending decision, defendants filed, on February 6, 1987, a motion seeking to\nmodify a single provision of the consent decree requiring single-celling at all institutions subject to the orders in\nthis case. Then, while it was pending, defendants gave notice of their intent to withdraw, without prejudice, the\nFebruary 6, 1987, motion to modify. Withdrawal of that motion was granted in the Court's order of June 4, 1987.\nThe defendants, by letter to the Court, suggested that the Court withhold ruling on the pending motions to modify\nthe remedial decree until the defendants could file a different, broader motion. Presumably, the instant motion to\nvacate, filed June 12, is that motion.\n843  B. The June 12, 1987 Motion to Vacate\n*843\nThe defendants' motion to vacate seeks to modify the 1980 decree by eliminating from it all provisions that, in the\nview of the defendants, are not based on federal law, or which cannot be construed plausibly as remedial\nmeasures designed to correct federal constitutional violations. The defendants contend that the eleventh\namendment to the United States Constitution and derivative considerations of comity require elimination from the\ndecree of any provisions that do not enforce federal rights.\nThe defendants essentially contend that \"portions of the 1980 consent decree create rights that are not grounded\nin federal law and thus cannot be enforced by a federal court.\" This argument has two essential threads: first, that\nfederal courts do not have authority to enter orders against states, or against state officials acting in their official\ncapacity, except to vindicate federal rights; and second, that in entering orders designed to vindicate federal\nrights, federal courts are constrained to limit those orders to measures required to protect those federal rights.\nThe first is based on the principle of sovereign immunity embodied in the eleventh amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. The second is based on judicially created considerations of federalism and comity which, in\ndefendants' view, are implicit in, or at least derivative from, the eleventh amendment principle.\nDefendants' motion to vacate ultimately raises questions regarding the nature of the eleventh amendment\nimmunity afforded to states and state officials and the relationship of that immunity to causes of action and\nremedial relief. Additionally, defendants' motion asserts that the judicially created doctrine of comity is rooted in\nthe eleventh amendment and embodies constraints on the exercise of jurisdiction over causes of action.\nFull and fair assessment of these complex, detailed arguments requires a careful analysis of the eleventh\namendment, sovereign immunity, the nature of federal constitutional rights, the jurisdiction of federal courts over\ncauses of action based on state rights, the nature of comity as a restraint on jurisdiction and/or relief, and the\neffect of these considerations when the Court enters a judgment by consent rather than a judgment following an\nadversary adjudication.\nV. The Eleventh Amendment, Sovereign Immunity, and Federal\nJurisdiction.\n\nA. The Eleventh Amendment, Sovereign Immunity00Federal Rights\n97\nThe eleventh amendment to the United States Constitution provides:\nThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or\nequity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of Another State,\nor by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\nAlthough its language is to the contrary, the amendment has been construed to prohibit suits against a state\nbrought by its own citizens as well as those brought by citizens of another state. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1,\n844 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890).[6] It is established, then, that the eleventh amendment shields the states *844\nfrom suit even when state actions are alleged to be in violation of the United States Constitution.\nThat doctrine, by its terms, undermines the supremacy of federal law and is therefore in derogation of the\nsupremacy clause of the United States Constitution. Art. VI, § 2. The Supreme Court avoided this unacceptable\nresult by its essential ruling in Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). In Young, the\nCourt held that the eleventh amendment does not bar an action against a state official alleging that the official's\nconduct violated the United States Constitution. In order to redeem the holding in Young, and thereby secure the\nsupremacy of federal law, the Supreme Court developed a now-famous analytical form: when the official actions\nof a state official come into conflict with the superior authority of the United States Constitution, the officer \"is in\nthat case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of\nhis individual conduct. The state has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme\n[7]\nauthority of the United States.\" Ex Parte Young, supra at 159-60.\nThe legal precept of Ex Parte Young is this: a state inherently lacks the authority to authorize one of its officers to\nact in a manner that violates the United States Constitution. Therefore, any officer acting in violation of the United\nStates Constitution is acting ultra vires. In so acting, the state official forfeits his representative character, and\nloses the sovereign immunity that, under the eleventh amendment, shields official state action from challenge in\nfederal court. In other words, Ex Parte Young approves equitable actions against state officials in their individual\ncapacities for violations of constitutional rights, the eleventh amendment notwithstanding. Thus, Ex Parte Young\nenables plaintiffs to allege \"state action\" sufficient to trigger the fourteenth amendment without automatically\n[8]\nraising the bar of the eleventh amendment.\nIt is not always easy to determine when an action in federal court is against the state, and therefore barred by the\neleventh amendment, and when it is against state officials acting in contravention of federal rights and therefore\noutside the shield of the eleventh amendment. But, the Court need not explore the nuances of that inquiry for\npurposes of addressing the present issue. It is sufficient to observe that equitable actions against state officials,\n[9]\nseeking prospective injunctive relief to correct federal constitutional deprivations, are permissible.\nB. The Eleventh Amendment and Sovereign Immunity 00 State Rights\n97\nin Federal Court\nThe rationale that supports Ex Parte Young 00 vindication of the supremacy of federal rights 00 does not apply to\n97 97\nactions in federal court in which plaintiffs seek vindication of rights based on state law. Pennhurst State School &\nHospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), presented the question of \"whether a\n845 federal court may award injunctive relief against state officials on the basis of state law.\" 465 U.S. at 91, 104 *845\n[10]\nS.Ct. at 903.  The Court answered the question in the negative, noting that\n[i]n such a case the entire basis for the doctrine of Young and Edelman disappears. A federal\ncourt's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or\nretroactive, does not vindicate the supreme authority of federal law. We conclude that Young and \nEdelman are inapplicable in a suit against state officials on the basis of state law.\n\n465 U.S. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.\nThe holding in Pennhurst is simply stated: the eleventh amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding\n[11]\ninjunctive relief against state officials on the basis of state law.\nVI. The Scope of Remedial Power 00 Comity and Equitable Discretion.\n97\nThe preceding section discussed limitations arising from the eleventh amendment on the power of federal courts\nto assume jurisdiction over suits involving causes of action based on (a) federal or (b) state law. The\nconstitutional constraints operate at the most fundamental level to deprive federal courts of authority, ab initio, to\ntake cognizance of legal claims. Apart from these doctrines, other considerations, arguably implicit in the\nconstitutional scheme but ultimately creations of wise judicial policy, restrain federal judicial action in the\ndetermination of remedies. These principles operate after the threshold question of federal jurisdiction has been\nanswered in the affirmative and a deprivation of federal rights has been found to exist. The most common term\nfor this principle of restraint is comity.\nOne is hard-pressed to define comity, although the concept pervades contemporary jurisprudence, particularly in\nthe area of institutional reform litigation. The essence of comity is restraint, both in adjudicating matters and in\nimposing remedies. First, comity requires that federal courts be reluctant to scrutinize the operations of state\ninstitutions in search of federal constitutional infirmities. Second, faced with proof of a violation of federal rights,\nfederal courts should intervene only to the extent required to vindicate those rights. In doing so, federal courts\nshould not \"impose upon [governmental agencies] their views of what constitutes wise economic or social policy.\"\n[12]\nDandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1971).\n846 *846 These considerations of restraint in no way vitiate the fundamental constitutional tenet that federal courts\nare empowered to vindicate federal rights, notwithstanding sovereign immunity or judicial restraint. Defendants'\nignore the distinction in the comity principle between restraint in adjudicating claims and restraint in formulating\nremedies, a critical distinction explicitly acknowledged in the authorities relied upon by the defendants. For\nexample, in their brief, the defendants cite Smith v. Sullivan, 611 F.2d 1039, 1045 (5th Cir.1980), for the\nproposition that \"courts ... may not become enmeshed in the minutiae of prison operations\" (internal citations\nomitted). In Smith, however, the quoted passage is immediately preceded by the obvious qualification, \"unless\nacting to remedy federal constitutional violations as part of a totality approach.\" Id.\nDefendants also rely on Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983),cert. dismissed, Meachum v. Battle,\n465 U.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79 L.Ed.2d 248 (1984), as authority for the related but separate strands of their\n[13]\ncomity argument 00 separation of powers and pragmatic restraint. See Defendants' brief, p. 6.  In Battle,\n97\nhowever, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit analyzed comity principles precisely as the Court does here.\nRecognizing the \"reluctance of federal courts to intervene in matters of prison administration,\" the court of\nappeals nonetheless approved the district court's conclusion that the principle of comity \"was not a justifiable\nbasis for failure to take cognizance of valid federal constitutional claims relating to rights secured to inmates by\nthe federal Constitution and the laws of the United States.\" 564 F.2d at 392, citing Procunier v. Martinez, supra at\n817, Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972), and Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89\nS.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969).\nDefendants also rely on a subsequent opinion in Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1523, and quote from that\nopinion an article from the Harvard Law Review by Professor Owen Fiss. Again, the matter is taken out of\ncontext, and ignores the holding of the court. In fact, the 1983 Battle opinion sets out simply and explicitly a\ndoctrine of equitable judicial power that serves to counterbalance, and ultimately overcome, whatever limitations\nmight be generated by the principle of comity. The court observes that \"the court, in exercising continuing\njurisdiction to achieve structural reform, cannot terminate its jurisdiction until it has eliminated the constitutional\nviolation `root and branch'.\" 708 F.2d at 1538, citing Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 438, 88 S.Ct.\n1689, 1694, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). Thus, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has directly applied to\ninstitutional reform litigation the vital principle that a federal court's equitable powers are inherently sufficiently\n\nbroad to allow federal courts to fashion effective injunctive relief to cure federal constitutional violations. The\nnature of the remedy for deprivation of federal constitutional rights is determined by the nature and scope of the\nconstitutional violation. Swann v. Charlotte Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267,\n847 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 *847 (1971). Once a constitutional violation is established, remedial decrees may require\nactions not independently required by the Constitution if those actions are, in the judgment of the court,\nnecessary to correct the constitutional deficiencies. Green v. County School Board, supra; Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977) (Milliken II); Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, 417 U.S. 556, 94\n[14]\nS.Ct. 2416, 41 L.Ed.2d 304 (1974).\nThe principles of equitable breadth and flexibility are at some tension with the doctrine of comity. This tension,\nhowever, is superficial; ultimately the doctrines are consistent. The preservation of the supremacy of federal law\nthat animated Ex Parte Young serves as well to reconcile the facial inconsistency of these doctrines. First, Ex\nParte Young makes clear that federal courts are authorized to vindicate federal rights, the principle of sovereign\nimmunity notwithstanding. Second, where federal constitutional rights have been traduced, principles of restraint,\nincluding comity, separation of powers and pragmatic caution, dissolve; federal courts are empowered and\nrequired to design equitable remedies that are effective to cure constitutional violations. In this tailoring of\nremedies, of course, the preferred course is to preserve as much discretion for state administrators as possible.\nYet, where constitutional rights have been violated, comity does not require, or even permit, a federal court to\ncountenance those violations. It thus is clear that in entering remedial decrees, such decrees should be (a)\ndesigned to be effective, (b) tailored to the constitutional violations, and (c) fashioned to restore victims to their\npositions before the constitutional violations. See n. 14, above. In guaranteeing that federal injunctions will be\neffective within these parameters, however, federal courts should be mindful of state sovereignty and should\nintrude as little as necessary on state prerogatives.\nThus, it is apparent that, whatever restraints are imposed by comity considerations, these limitations are not\njurisdictional. Since there is no jurisdictional bar to a court's evaluating claims of federal constitutional violation,\neven in a setting as delicate as that involving the operations of a state institution, the consequent limitations on a\ncourt's assessment of a consent decree presented to the court by the parties, are not jurisdictional. Indeed, when\na remedy has been fashioned with the participation and consent of the state, and that remedy is presented to the\ncourt, the role of judicial restraint is problematic. In such a situation, it is the prison administrators themselves\nwho are proposing the remedy. Absent a limitation on assuming jurisdiction over the proposed remedy, the court\nmust make two inquiries: first, is the remedy sufficient to protect the interests of the plaintiff class? (This inquiry is\nmandated by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.) Second, is the relief illegal? Local No. 93\n(Firefighters) v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986) (a federal court may\nenter a consent decree that provides relief greater than the court might have awarded after trial, unless the relief\nis illegal).\nVII. Preliminary Conclusions of Law.\nBefore undertaking a discussion of the weaknesses in defendants' jurisdictional argument, certain fundamental\nprinciples, derived from the foregoing discussion, should be set out.\n848 *848 1. The eleventh amendment bars a suit of any kind against a state in its own name. Hans v. Louisiana,\nsupra.\n2. The eleventh amendment bars a suit against a state official when the suit, in essence, is one that would\noperate against the state. Edelman v. Jordan, supra.\n3. The eleventh amendment bars a suit against the state official seeking injunctive relief based on state law. \nPennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, supra.\n4. The eleventh amendment does not bar a suit against a state official seeking injunctive relief, alleging that the\nstate official has violated federal law and seeking only prospective relief. Ex Parte Young, supra.\n\n5. In fashioning a remedy for constitutional violations, the court should tailor its remedy to constitutional\nviolations, yet insure that the remedy effectively cures the constitutional violations and restores the victims to their\npositions before the constitutional violation. Swann v. Charlotte Mecklenberg, supra; Green v. County School\nBoard, supra; Battle v. Anderson, supra.\nVIII. Discussion.\nDefendants' argument rests on a fundamental confusion and misapplication of two principles: the jurisdictional\nlimitations derived from the eleventh amendment, and the equitable considerations derived from the principle of\ncomity.\nPlaintiffs' first amended complaint, as observed previously, set forth extensive factual allegations, relating to\nvirtually every facet of the operation of the Penitentiary of New Mexico. Plaintiffs' first claim for relief alleged that,\non whole, the factual conditions at the Penitentiary of New Mexico deprived the plaintiff class of rights secured by\nthe United States Constitution. As a threshold matter, then, federal jurisdiction over the civil action existed by\nvirtue of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(3).\nAs a matter of fundamental due process, the defendants had the right to challenge the factual allegations set out\nin the complaint and thereby put the plaintiffs to their proof. Through the adjudicative process, defendants had the\nright to challenge the conclusion of law that the conditions alleged and proved by the plaintiffs, viewed in their\ntotality, violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff class. By agreeing to the entry of a consent judgment,\nhowever, the defendants waived their right to trial on the factual allegations and adjudication of the legal\nconclusion. See generally Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 316, 48 S.Ct. 311, 312, 72 L.Ed. 587\n(1928); Local No. 93 (Firefighters) v. City of Cleveland, supra.\nFollowing the waiver of the right to proof of violation, the next step in the process of adjudication became the\nfashioning of appropriate remedies. The parties presented to the Court an agreed remedial order. In doing so, the\n[15]\ndefendants waived their rights to the restraints of comity in the selection of equitable remedies.  Indeed,\njudicial application of such restraints in the face of a remedy proposed by the defendants would be anomalous.\nFaced with a proposed consent decree, setting out relief that is the product of agreement of the parties, the Court\nis under an obligation to address only three issues:\nFirst, is the complaint, which serves as the sole judicial cognizable basis for jurisdiction, sufficient to invoke\nfederal jurisdiction? That inquiry is easily satisfied, as set out above.\nSecond, is the relief illegal? Nothing in the consent decree requires action, or refraining from action, on the part of\nstate officials in a manner that would violate the law. Thus, the consent decree does not violate the principle\nestablished by the United States Supreme Court in Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland, supra.\nThird, is the relief adequate to protect the interest of the plaintiff class? As discussed in section II, above, this\n849 inquiry, *849 governed by Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P., was conducted and the Court's conclusion is supported. Thus,\nthe Court, in exercising power over a civil action that properly invoked federal jurisdiction, approved a remedial\norder the content of which was the product of free, unhindered, plenary negotiations between the parties.\nThe defendants' motion to vacate portions of the order is based on the assertion that, notwithstanding the\nexistence of a complaint properly invoking federal jurisdiction and the proper entry of a lawful consent decree,\nany portions of the consent judgment that are not grounded in federal law, or that cannot plausibly be viewed as\nremedies for federal violations, are void as a matter of jurisdiction. This legal position involves two distinct errors.\n[16]\nDefendants construe Pennhurst as holding that \"the Eleventh Amendment deprives a federal court of the power\nto award any relief, injunctive or otherwise, against state officials sued in their official capacity, except where that\nrelief is premised on federal law. Defendants' brief, p. 11. This construction of Pennhurst is entirely accurate.\nDefendants' argument from Pennhurst, however, transmutes the pronounced principle into a limitation on remedy.\nThis distortion is a fundamental error which undermines defendants' argument. Careful analysis of Pennhurst\n\ndemonstrates that the eleventh amendment immunity identified and applied in that case is a product of the cause\nof action alleged by the Pennhurst plaintiffs and relied upon by the Court as a predicate for relief. This critical fact,\nwhich is ignored by defendants, is demonstrated unequivocally at several places in the opinion. The Court stated\nthe question before it to be \"whether the claim that petitioners violated state law in carrying out their official duties\nat Pennhurst is one against the state and therefore barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\" 465 U.S. at 103, 104\nS.Ct. at 909 (emphasis in original). The Pennhurst Court concluded \"that Young and Edelman are inapplicable in\na suit against state officials on the basis of state law.\" Id. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911. Finally, the Court described its\nholding to be that \"federal courts lack jurisdiction to enjoin state institutions and state officials on the basis of this\nstate law.\" Id. at 124-25, 104 S.Ct. at 921. The clear implication of Pennhurst, however, is that entry of relief\nwould be appropriate if necessary to vindicate the supremacy of federal law.\nDefendants also ignore the connection of the holding in Pennhurst to the cause of action upon which the district\ncourt predicated its award of injunctive relief. Moreover, their characterization of Pennhurst as a limitation on the\nscope of relief in the face of federal violation is unsupported. Indeed, since Pennhurst involved no proof of federal\nviolation, any interpretation of Pennhurst as a limitation on relief for violations of federal law is unwarranted.\nThe mischaracterization of Pennhurst is most clearly revealed on page 12 of defendants' brief, where they assert\nthat \"Pennhurst recognized a specific constitutional basis for the comity principle, with attendant limitations on the\nsituations in which a consent decree can be treated as a waiver by the state of its immunity from excessive\nfederal decrees.\" This assertion is puzzling, for at least two reasons. First, the Supreme Court specifically\nannounced that it did not need to reach the issue of comity, because it found \"the Eleventh Amendment challenge\n850 dispositive.\" 465 U.S. at *850 97, 104 S.Ct. at 906. Second, Pennhurst had nothing to do with a consent decree,\nand contains no statement whatever as to the limitation on remedies agreed to by consent. This critical\ncomponent of defendants' argument from Pennhurst is, in fact, unsupported by that case.\nLelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243,reh'g denied,815 F.2d 1034 (5th Cir.1987), similarly does not support\ndefendants' argument. In Lelsz, the court of appeals reviewed an order entered to enforce provisions of a\nconsent decree that had been entered two years earlier. The underlying action raised federal constitutional and\nstate law claims relating to treatment of the plaintiff class which was comprised of mentally retarded patients\nhoused in state schools. The consent decree approved by the court consisted of numerous provisions relating to\ntreatment of the mentally retarded. Slightly more than one and onehalf years after entry of the consent decree,\nthe plaintiffs filed a motion for community placement, alleging that the transfer of members of the plaintiff class to\ncommunity facilities was necessary to achieve compliance with the consent decree. Following a hearing on the\nmotion, the court entered an order directing transfer to community centers. That order was appealed and is the\nsubject of the opinion in Lelsz.\nThe court of appeals vacated the enforcement order. The court noted first that the order approving the underlying\nconsent decree \"painstakingly illicits the constitutional or statutory basis for relief afforded in every significant\nparagraph of the [consent decree]. That order readily demonstrates that any rights the class members may have\nwith regard to community placement were understood by the district court to originate in, and do in fact exist in,\n[17]\nstate law.\" 807 F.2d at 1247.  This conclusion required the court of appeals, pursuant to Pennhurst, to\n[18]\nconclude that the relief granted was grounded solely on state law.\nLelsz has been interpreted in Ibarra v. Texas Employment Commission, 823 F.2d 873 (5th Cir.1987). Ibarra\nconstrued Lelsz as applying Pennhurst to vacate a portion of the district court order enforcing the consent decree\nwhen the relief provided by that part of the decree was grounded solely on state law. 823 F.2d at 877, citing \nLelsz, 815 F.2d at 1034. The Ibarra court held:\nAssuming without deciding that Pennhurst would extend to a federal court order approving a\nconsent decree, we conclude that Pennhurst does not apply to the present case because the\nconsent decree is not based on state law. ... The concerns about state sovereignty and the lack of\nany federal interests that were critical to Pennhurst are not appropriate when, as in this case, the\nissue is one of interpreting federal law.\n\nThus, any implication that the Lelsz holding went beyond an application of Pennhurst to a consent decree based\n851 solely on state law is eliminated dispositively by *851Ibarra.[19]\nLelsz, as clarified in Ibarra, then, reads Pennhurst to hold that a federal court does not, under Pennhurst, have\njurisdiction to approve a consent decree predicated solely on state law violations since to do so would offend the\n[20]\neleventh amendment.  This doctrine has no bearing, however, on the present case. Here, the plaintiffs' first\namended complaint alleged violations of federal law. In response to that complaint, the parties agreed to entry of\ncomprehensive relief. It is literally true that every substantive section of the consent decree is tied to factual\nallegations in the first amended complaint, which form the factual predicate for plaintiffs' claim that the totality of\n[21]\nconditions at the Penitentiary of New Mexico offends the United States Constitution.\nThe foregoing discussion produces two clear conclusions, each of which mandates rejection of each separate\nstrand of defendants' argument.\nFirst, because the complaint named state officials in their official capacity as defendants in a suit seeking purely\ninjunctive relief for federal constitutional violations, the eleventh amendment did not afford defendants sovereign\nimmunity. Accordingly, the Court had, and has, jurisdiction over the civil action. See Welsch v. Gardebring, 667\n[22]\nF.Supp. at 1288-89.\nSecond, because each element of the relief afforded in the consent decree is tied to a factual allegation in the\ncomplaint asserting federal constitutional violations based on the totality of the circumstances, the Court had\n852 jurisdiction to enter the consent decree.[23] Thus, defendants' argument that *852 the consent decree approved\nby the Court in this case is void because it abrogates the state's eleventh amendment immunity, is unavailing.\nThe second major premise of defendants' argument is that even when federal jurisdiction exists, the principle of\ncomity prohibits the entry of relief, even by consent, that extends beyond the measures the Court could have\nimposed following trial. There is no authority cited by the defendants or discovered by the Court that supports this\nnovel proposition. Indeed, the same proposition was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in Local No.\n[24]\n93 (Firefighters) v. City of Cleveland, supra.\nIn Firefighters, the Supreme Court reviewed a consent decree that indisputably granted to plaintiffs substantive\nrelief that went beyond what could have been granted following a trial on the merits. Faced with a challenge that\nsuch relief was unauthorized for that the reason, the Supreme Court rejected the contention. As made clear by a\nlengthy discussion of the nature of consent decrees, the Court concluded that \"a federal court is not necessarily\nbarred from entering a consent decree merely because the decree provides broader relief than the court could\nhave awarded after a trial.\" 478 U.S. at ___, 106 S.Ct. at 3077, 92 L.Ed.2d at 425. In fact, the Supreme Court\nheld that relief in the form of a consent judgment is constrained only by principles of illegality in that a federal\ncourt cannot approve relief that would require a violation of substantive law. There is, of course, nothing in the\nconsent decree in this case which requires the defendants to violate any law.\nDefendants' attempt to apply the principles of comity and restraint to the Court's review of a consent decree also\nsuggests a peculiar paradox. Were the Court to reject a consent judgment, agreed to by the defendants, on the\nbasis of comity considerations, it would thereby be arrogating the authority of duly empowered state officials to\ndetermine the proper operation of state institutions 00 precisely the judicial act that most offends the defendants.\n97\nThe essence of the consent decree00its animation, in the words of the Supreme Court (see Firefighters, supra\n97\n478 U.S. at ___, 106 S.Ct. at 3077, 92 L.Ed.2d at 425) 00 is the consent of the party. Here, the properly named\n97\nstate officials, following negotiations, freely agreed to provisions that would govern the operation of the state's\nprisons. It would be a bizarre perversion of the principle of comity to suggest that a federal court is required, in\norder to preserve state autonomy, to override the decisions of state officials and substitute its own judgments.\nSeveral references to defendants' brief will suffice to demonstrate the internal contradiction of defendants'\nargument. In footnote 1, page 2, the defendants contend that \"a federal court ordinarily should accept any\nreasonable remedial proposal made by ... defendants,\" citing New York State Association for Retarded Children,\nInc. v. Carey, 706 F.2d 956, 971 (2d Cir. 1983),cert. denied,464 U.S. 915, 104 S.Ct. 277, 78 L.Ed.2d 257 (1983).\n\n\"A federal court is not empowered to `impose upon [governmental agencies] their views of what constitutes wise\neconomic or social policy.'\" Defendants' brief at p. 4, citing Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486, 90 S.Ct.\n1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). Federal courts should exercise \"scrupulous regard for the rightful\nindependence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts.\" Fair Assessment in\n[25]\nReal Estate Association v. McNary, 454 U.S. 100, 111, 102 S.Ct. 177, 183, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981).\n853 *853 This Court had no cognizable basis on which to alter the structure or detail of the negotiated consent\n[26]\njudgment presented to it for review and approval by the parties.  Given that the civil action was properly before\nthe Court, its review of that judgment was limited to a determination of whether any of the relief contained in the\ndecree was illegal and whether the relief was sufficient to protect the interests of the plaintiffs' class. The Court\nconducted the appropriate review and consequently approved the consent decree. There is no basis for the\nCourt's independent application of its judgment as to the propriety of the specific relief agreed to by the parties in\nview of the appropriate presumption that the parties have negotiated at arms length and have agreed that the\nstructure of remedies in the consent decree is a fair resolution of their competing claims.\nIX. Modification.\nDefendants' motion also seeks to vacate portions of the 1980 decree. Although the rule under which this relief is\nsought is not explicated, the structure of the argument makes clear defendants seek relief under Rule 60(b)(4),\nFed.R.Civ.P., which provides that relief from final judgment should be granted when \"the judgment is void.\" See\nDefendants' brief, p. 13. As noted earlier, footnote 1 of defendants' brief suggests that if their comity-based\narguments are rejected at the jurisdictional level, they should inform the Court's assessment of the propriety of\nmodification. As is made clear in this order, defendants' jurisdictional arguments seeking vacation of the decree\nare rejected in that they are unsupported by existing law. The Court is mindful, however, that under certain\ncircumstances, a judgment may be modified or altered in its prospective application. The potential legal bases for\naction of this kind need not be set out here, although the Court has addressed the issue as a general matter\npreviously. See Order of October 3, 1986. That order evidences the Court's awareness of United States v. Swift,\n286 U.S. 106, 52 S.Ct. 460, 76 L.Ed.2d 999 (1932); New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey\n(Willowbrook), supra; Newman v. Graddick, 740 F.2d 1513 (11th Cir.1984), and related cases.\nThe \"flexible\" approach to modification set out in Carey and related cases permits the Court to assess requests\nfor modification that promote the interest of comity by preserving state administrative discretion as to the means\nof accomplishing the particular objectives set forth in a decree. That process, however, involves careful\nassessment not only of the structure of the order and its relationship to administrative discretion, but of other\nfactual considerations including, but not limited to, the state of compliance with existing orders, the degree to\nwhich any federal constitutional violations have been cured \"root and branch,\" and the existence of safeguards to\nprevent future violations. That complex inquiry is one the Court will not undertake in the absence of an\nappropriate, comprehensive evidentiary record and a thorough briefing on the appropriate standards for\n[27]\nmodification, to include the equitable bases for modification and the particular modification sought.\nX. Conclusion.\n854 The eleventh amendment does not provide immunity to state officials from equitable *854 actions based on\nfederal constitutional rights. The comity limitations urged by the defendants do not require the Court to interfere\nwith the considered judgments of parties in the fashioning of the consent judgment. The defendants' motion to\nvacate will be denied.\nWherefore,\nIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that defendants' motion to vacate be, and the same hereby is,\ndenied.\n\n[1] The entire consent decree was approved and entered on July 14, 1980. Certain portions of the decree,\nrelating to correspondence, public and attorney visitation, food service, legal access, and visiting, were submitted\nto the Court in 1979, and were approved at various times during that year.\n[2] At the time the first amended complaint was filed, the class definition was limited to all prisoners who are or\nwill be confined in the Penitentiary of New Mexico, the only prison in the state other than those confined in\nminimum security facilities, who are not part of the class. The Court's July 14, 1980, order approving the\ncomprehensive consent decree expanded the class, \"by agreement of the parties ... to include all those inmates\nwho are now, or in the future may be, incarcerated in the Penitentiary of New Mexico at Santa Fe or at any\nmaximum, close, or medium security facility open for operation by the State of New Mexico after June 12, 1980.\"\n[3] The Court's jurisdiction over the state constitutional and statutory law claims was posited on principles of\npendent jurisdiction.\n[4] The subjects of the consent decree are correspondence, public and attorney visitation, food service, legal\naccess, visitation, classification, living conditions, inmate activity, medical care, mental health care, staffing and\ntraining maximum security and inmate discipline. Critically, each of these areas relates to one or more of the\nfactual allegations set out in the first amended complaint, and incorporated into the first claim for relief, predicated\non rights secured by the United States Constitution. First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 15-32 (factual allegations) and\n¶¶ 33-34 (First Claim for Relief). The precise correlation of the portions of the consent decree and the paragraphs\nof the first amended complaint is analyzed in n. 21, below.\n[5] The process by which that record was described is set out in the Court's order of January 10, 1986.\n[6] There is considerable disharmony among the current members of the United States Supreme Court as to the\nvalidity of the holding in Hans. Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens have expressed their opinion\nthat Hans v. Louisiana, and the derivative holding in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d\n662 (1974), \"cannot be reconciled with the federal system envisioned by [the Constitution].\" Atascadero State\nHosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 303, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3179, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985) (Justice Blackmun, joined by\nJustices Marshall, Brennan and Stevens, dissenting). \nJustice Scalia has expressed his view that \"the correctness of Hans as an original matter, and the feasibility, if it\nwas wrong, of correcting it without distorting what we have done in tacit reliance upon it, [are] complex enough\nquestions that I am unwilling to address them in a case whose presentation focused on other matters.\" Welch v.\nTexas Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp., 483 U.S. ___, ___, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2958, 97 L.Ed.2d 389, 411 (1987)\n(Justice Scalia concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).\nNotwithstanding the possible infirmity of Hans, its holding must be, and is, fully accepted for purposes of the\npresent discussion.\n[7] The obvious paradox of this construct 00 that such actions by state officials are \"state action\" for purposes of\n97\nthe fourteenth amendment but not for purposes of the eleventh amendment 00 has been recognized by the Court,\n97\nbut has not undermined the vitality of the principle. See Florida Dep't of State v. Treasurer Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S.\n670, 685, 102 S.Ct. 3304, 3314-15, 73 L.Ed.2d 1057 (1982).\n[8] This principle is further elucidated in Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 227 U.S. 278,\n33 S.Ct. 312, 57 L.Ed. 510 (1913) which establishes the fourteenth amendment as a substantive rule of conduct\nbinding on state officials individually regardless of whether or not the state has officially sanctioned their actions.\n[9] Actions of this kind are not barred by the eleventh amendment even if they will have a significant effect on the\nstate treasury. Edelman v. Jordan, supra 415 U.S. at 660-73, 94 S.Ct. at 1354-61. \"Such an ancillary effect on\notherwise sovereign affairs of the state is a permissible and often inevitable consequence of the principle\nannounced in Ex Parte Young.\" Id. at 668, 94 S.Ct. at 1358.\n[10] The state law claims in Pennhurst were pendant to federal constitutional and statutory claims. After holding\nthat the eleventh amendment prohibits injunctive relief against state officials based on state law, the Court in \nPennhurst assessed the effect of the principle on federal court pendant jurisdiction. The Court held that pendent\n\njurisdiction does not overcome the bar of the eleventh amendment, noting that \"a claim that state officials violated\nstate law in carrying out their official responsibilities is a claim against the state that is protected by the Eleventh\nAmendment. We now hold that this principle applies as well to state law claims brought into federal court under\npendent jurisdiction.\" 465 U.S. at 121.\n[11] Defendants extrapolate from Pennhurst three significant principles: \n1. An extension of federal judicial power cannot be predicated on violation of state law. (This formulation is, of\ncourse, overly broad. The holding in Pennhurst is that the eleventh amendment proscribes the exercise of federal\njudicial power against states on the basis of a state's own law. There is nothing in Pennhurst to suggest that other\nforms of pendent jurisdiction are unconstitutional.)\n2. There is a specific constitutional basis for the comity principle, with attendant limitations on the situations in\nwhich a consent decree can be treated as a waiver by a state of its immunity from excessive federal decrees.\n(This is an unsupported conclusion; the error, which is at the heart of defendants' argument, is discussed at\nlength in Section VIII, below.) 3. The eleventh amendment creates a jurisdictional limitation on federal judicial\npower, thereby rendering decrees entered in violation of that limitation void. (This principle as stated is correct,\nbut is inapplicable to the present case for reasons discussed at length in this memorandum.)\nSee Defendant's brief, p. 12.\n[12] Defendants correctly point out that the \"principle of restraint is derived from several interrelated concerns.\"\nDefendants' brief p. 4. First, the principle of separation of powers cautions against the usurpation, by the judiciary,\nof functions properly charged to the legislative and executive branches of the government. Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 548, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878-79, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404-05, 94\nS.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). Apart from this general principle, practical restraints dictate that the\njudiciary should be loath to assume the task of restructuring the operations of state government. Particularly\nwhere the daily operation of a corrections facility is in question, the judiciary should not lightly assume\nresponsibility for making the day-to-day decisions that require a closer familiarity with the institution than is\npossessed by the court. See generally Bell v. Wolfish, supra at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878; Procunier v. Martinez,\nsupra 416 U.S. at 405, 94 S.Ct. at 1807.\n[13] Throughout their brief, defendants entwine the concept of comity with that of separation of powers. For\nexample, defendants quote the Supreme Court's opinion in Bell v. Wolfish, noting that intrusive judicial decrees\nusurp the role preserved under our constitutional system for the \"legislative and executive branches of our\ngovernment, not the judicial.\" 441 U.S. at 548, 99 S.Ct. at 1879. Separation of powers arguments have no role,\nhowever, where properly named defendants are charged with violations of federal rights and are held\naccountable for those violations by injunctions that mandate specific measures designed to reinstate and protect\nconstitutional rights.\n[14] It is worth noting that the holding in Milliken II followed the Supreme Court's holding in Milliken v. Bradley (\nMilliken I), 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974), where the Court noted that the Court's\nequitable remedy must be related to \"the condition that offends the Constitution.\" 418 U.S. at 738, 94 S.Ct. at\n3124. Milliken I and Milliken II therefore establish the fundamental principle that a remedial decree entered to\ncorrect constitutional violations must be designed as nearly as possible to correct the constitutional violation and\nto restore the victims of unconstitutional conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such\nconduct. This formulation is merely a more elaborate restatement of the principle embraced by the court of\nappeals in Battle v. Anderson that constitutional violations must be eliminated \"root and branch.\" 708 F.2d at 1538\n.\n[15] This is not to suggest that the defendants waived eleventh amendment limitations. As set out in this order,\nbecause of the federal basis for the plaintiffs' claims for relief, those limitations were not at issue in this action.\n[16] Another fundamental error 00 the discussion of waiver 00 is also at the heart of defendants' position. Because\n97 97\nthis issue is irrelevant, it will not be treated in the text. The discussion of waiver in defendants' brief contends that\nany waiver of the state's sovereign immunity was unauthorized as a matter of law, and therefore is ineffective, at\nleast as a constraint on the conduct of successor officials. As demonstrated in the text, the state defendants\n\nnamed in the first amended complaint were not protected from the allegations of that complaint by virtue of\nsovereign immunity. The complaint alleges federal constitutional violations and seeks injunctive relief to correct\nthose violations. In the face of such allegations, and a federal cause of action structured in the manner of the first\namended complaint, state officials, properly named, do not enjoy sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the question of\nwaiver of sovereign immunity did not arise in this proceeding. Rather, the relevant waivers were of proof of\nconstitutional violation and of comity-based constraints in the form of equitable relief.\n[17] The court concluded on the basis of a clear record, that the relief in the consent decree was predicated \nsolely on state law. This conclusion left the question for the Lelsz court as to \"whether the district court may\nenforce the consent decree beyond the guarantees contained in the federal Constitution and laws simply\nbecause it is a consent decree.\" The court held ultimately that such enforcement violated the eleventh\namendment. That question is inartfully formed, however, since the precise question was whether a district court\ncan enforce a consent decree based solely on state law. The Lelsz court held that such enforcement violated \nPennhurst. To the extent the Lelsz court answered a broader question, that answer is dicta. See discussion of \nIbarra v. Texas Employment Comm'n, below.\n[18] This conclusion was strongly attacked by Judge Reavley in an opinion dissenting from the denial of a petition\nfor rehearing en banc. See815 F.2d at 1035-37. Seven of the fourteen judges voting dissented from the denial of\nthe motion for rehearing. Of particular note is the following portion of Judge Reavley's dissent: \nIn a contested case, in which a pendent statelaw claim is asserted, Pennhurst, requires the federal court to look\nat the source of the claim, but where the parties have not separated their claims and remedies and agree on\nremedies for both, Pennhurst itself places no jurisdictional limitation upon the federal court in enforcing the\nagreement\nLelsz, 815 F.2d at 1036.\n[19]Cf. Welsch v. Gardebring, 667 F.Supp. 1284, 1289 (D.Minn.1987), which is discussed below in note 22.\n[20] Again, Judge Reavley's distinction between a pure state law claim, and mixed claims, is critical but ignored in\nLelsz.\n[21] The following chart demonstrates the relationship between paragraphs in the first amended complaint and\nportions of the consent decree. \nCorrespondence -               ¶ 28\nPublic/Attorney Visitation -   ¶ 27\nFood Service -                 ¶ 21\nLegal Access -                 ¶¶ 30, 31\nVisitation -                   ¶ 27\nClassification -               ¶ 24\nLiving Conditions -            ¶¶ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\nInmate Activity -              ¶¶ 19, 24, 25, 26\nMedical Care -                 ¶ 29\nMental Health Care -           ¶ 29\nStaffing and Staff Training -  ¶¶ 22, 23\nMaximum Security -             ¶ 23\nInmate Discipline -            ¶ 32\n[22] In Welsch v. Gardebring, the defendants, in challenging the court's jurisdiction to approve a consent decree,\nmade essentially the same argument which is presented here in defendants' motion. The district court's rejection\nof that argument is predicated on analysis of Pennhurst, Ex Parte Young, and Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland,\nas is done in this opinion.\n[23] Defendants' reliance on Washington v. Penwell, 700 F.2d 570 (9th Cir.1983), is also misplaced. In Penwell,\nthe defendants sought to vacate a provision of the consent decree that required the state to fund a prisoners'\n\nlegal services organization at a defined level. That provision had been entered by consent in response to a claim\nthat indigent Oregon prisoners were provided with inadequate legal facilities. The court of appeals affirmed the\ndistrict court's decision vacating the challenged portion. In doing so, the court noted that the provision on its face\nran against the State of Oregon and did not limit the decree to the defendants' best efforts to obtain state funding.\n700 F.2d at 574. As such, the provision ran afoul of the eleventh amendment. It has long been established that a\ncourt order running directly against the state treasury violates the eleventh amendment. See, e.g., Edelman v.\nJordan, supra.\nCertain language in Penwell suggests that the funding provision is unenforceable not only because it runs directly\nagainst the state but also because it is more than is required to alleviate violations of federal law. This language,\nhowever, must be viewed in context of the full discussion of the case, which notes that \"if general legal services\nfor prisoners were required by the Constitution, we might be able to enforce this provision, notwithstanding the\nstate's protest.\" 700 F.2d at 574. That language follows immediately the court's discussion of Edelman and \nYoung. In this context, then, the Penwell holding must be stated as follows: Where a provision in a federal court\norder explicitly runs directly against the state treasury, and cannot be construed as a provision enforcing federal\nlaw which will have an ancillary effect on the state treasury (thereby bringing the injunction within the scope\napproved by Edelman), the provision is unenforceable. So construed, Penwell does not apply to the present\ncircumstance. First, there is no provision in the consent decree in this case that specifically requires funding by\nthe State of New Mexico. Second, every section of the consent decree in this case is tied to an allegation of\nfederal constitutional deprivation.\n[24] Defendants' citation to Nelson v. Collins, 659 F.2d 420, 429 (4th Cir.1981) (en banc), is inappropriate. In \nNelson v. Collins, no constitutional violation was established. Understandably, when there is no violation, equity\nhas no standing to provide a remedy. Nelson does not support any other principle.\n[25]McNary is the only case this Court has discovered that discussed comity as a jurisdictional constraint. Of\ncourse, McNary arose in the peculiar and unique context of a challenge to a state taxing scheme. The restraint\non the federal court in such an action derives from the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, which prohibits\ndistrict courts from enjoining state tax activities where there is a plain, speedy and efficient remedy in the courts\nof that state. See454 U.S. at 103, 102 S.Ct. at 179-80. See also Tully v. Griffin, 429 U.S. 68, 73, 97 S.Ct. 219,\n222-23, 50 L.Ed.2d 227 (1976),quoted in Rosewell v. Lasalle National Bank, 450 U.S. 503, 522, 101 S.Ct. 1221,\n1233-34, 67 L.Ed.2d 464 (1981).\n[26] Indeed, when presented with a consent decree compromising a class action, the Court is limited to one of\ntwo actions: approving the decree, or rejecting it. It is elemental that in conducting a Rule 23 review of a\nproposed class action compromise, the Court may not substitute its judgments of fairness for those of the\nlitigants. Plainly, the Court would be without authority to enter a consent judgment other than that agreed to by\nthe parties, since the consent of the parties would no longer animate the decree.\n[27] The Court is mindful that some endeavor to this end has been undertaken previously. The defendants,\nhowever, terminated that process by filing the motion that is the subject of this order.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

As a result of the settlement conferences, the parties \nreached an agreement which they reduced to writing and executed on the 14th day of May, 2019. \nFollowing a hearing with United States Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa on June 11, 2019, the \nparties  agreed  to  clarify  certain  terms  of their  agreement.  The  parties  incorporated  those \nclarifications into a Revised Settlement Agreement and they, through their undersigned counsel, \nexecuted  the  Revised  Settlement  Agreement  on  August  14,  2019.  Following  the  Court's \npreliminary approval of the Revised Settlement Agreement on September 5, 2019, the parties \nagreed  to  certain  modifications  to  the  Revised  Settlement  Agreement,  which  have  been \nincorporated into this Second Revised Settlement Agreement. This Second Revised Settlement \nAgreement (referred to herein as the \"Revised Settlement Agreement\") is now the operative \nversion of the Settlement Agreement and it supersedes the May 14, 2019, and August 14, 2019, \nversions of the Agreement. \nEXHIBIT A\n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 2 of 15\n1.  The  New Mexico  Corrections  Department  (\"NMCD\")  agrees  to  take  the  following \nmeasures to reduce overcrowding and prevent further overcrowding in the future: \na.  NMCD will ensure that each inmate housed in a dormitory or multiple occupancy \nroom will have no less than 50 square feet of combined living and sleeping space, \nexcluding dayrooms and bathrooms. \nb.  NMCD will take the following steps  to  reduce  the  number of inmates in the \nfollowing facilities: \n1.  Northwest New Mexico Correctional Facility (NWNMCF) - Within  18 \nmonths from entry of this Court's preliminary approval order, NMCD will \nreduce NWNMCF's rated capacity from 748 inmates to 673 inmates and \nwill not exceed the new rated capacity except as provided in this Revised \nSettlement Agreement. NMCD will accomplish this change by transferring \nat least 75 inmates from the dormitories to other New Mexico facilities with \nadequate space. Plaintiffs agree that by complying with this subparagraph \n(1 )(b )(i), NMCD will have established at least 50 square feet of combined \nliving and sleeping space, excluding dayrooms and bathrooms. \nn.  Springer Con-ectional Center (SCC)- Within 18 months from the entry of \nthis Court's preliminary approval order, NMCD will reduce SCC's rated \ncapacity from 437 inmates to 308 inmates and will not exceed the new rated \ncapacity except as provided in this Revised Settlement Agreement. NMCD \nwill accomplish this change by transferring at least 129 inmates from the \ndormitories to other New Mexico facilities with adequate space. Plaintiffs \nagree that by complying with this subparagraph (l)(b)(ii), NMCD will have \n2 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 3 of 15\nestablished at least 50 square feet of combined living and sleeping space, \nexcluding dayrooms and bathrooms. \n111.  Western New Mexico Correctional Facility (WNMCF)- Within 18 months \nfrom entry of this Court's preliminary approval order, NMCD will reduce \nWNMCF's rated capacity from 393 inmates to 353 inmates and will not \nexceed the new rated capacity except as provided in this Revised Settlement \nAgreement. NMCD will accomplish this change by transferring at least 40 \ninmates from the dormitories and multiple occupancy rooms at WNMCF to \nother New Mexico facilities with adequate space. Plaintiffs agree that by \ncomplying with this subparagraph (l)(b)(iii), NMCD will have established \nat least 50 square feet of combined living and sleeping space, excluding \ndayrooms and bathrooms. \nIV.  Otero County Prison Facility (OCPF)-Within 18 months from entry of this \nCourt's preliminary  approval order,  NMCD will reduce OCPF's rated \ncapacity from 64 7 inmates to 607 inmates and will not exceed the new rated \ncapacity except as provided in this Revised Settlement Agreement. NMCD \nwill accomplish this change by transferring as least 40 inmates from the \ndormitories to other New Mexico facilities with adequate space. Plaintiffs \nagree that by complying with this subparagraph (1 )(b )(iv), NMCD will have \nestablished at least 50 square feet of combined living and sleeping space, \nexcluding dayrooms and bathrooms. \nv.  Once NMCD has reduced the number of inmates in dormitories as provided \nil). subparagraphs (1 )(b )(i)-(iv) above, for purposes of disengagement, it will \n3 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 4 of 15\nmaintain the reduced number of inmates resulting from those moves for a \nperiod of at least six months.  Defendants shall not make a motion for \nsubstantial compliance with this provision until the end of that six month \nperiod. \nc.  NMCD will not house more than one inmate in a cell unless that cell contains at \nleast 120 square feet, and such cells must allow prisoners direct access to hygiene \nfacilities without assistance from a staff member. \nException to subparagraph (l)(c): The S-Unit (now HU3) at WNMCF may \n1. \nbe used for double occupancy housing, but because these rooms do not \ncontain toilets, sinks, or any running water, the doors to these rooms must \nremain  open at all  times  unless there  is a  bona fide  emergency  or an \noccupant requests that his or her door be locked. In these events, care must \nbe taken to unlock the door promptly whenever any occupant of a locked \nroom requests that the door be unlocked. An emergency is defined as a \ncircumstance caused by a riot, fire, or similar event not caused intentionally \nby Defendants, their agents, or employees. \nd.  Areas, including dayrooms, not designed for housing prisoners may be utilized for \nthe housing of prisoners only as provided in this Revised Settlement Agreement. \nFrom time to time, NMCD may need to place prisoners in dayrooms on a \n1. \ntemporary basis to accommodate increasing population levels while other \nalternatives are developed. \nn.  NMCD may house prisoners in dayrooms only if the following conditions \nare met: \n4 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 5 of 15\n1.  When a need arises for prisoners to be housed in any dayroom, if \nvacancies exist at any minimum or medium security facility, NMCD \nshall  make  conscientious  efforts  through  the  application  of its \nclassification  procedures  in  operation  at  that  time  to  identify \nmedium  security  prisoners  eligible  for  reclassification  and \nreassignment to minimum security facilities or reassignment to other \nmedium security facilities where non-dayroom beds are available. \nIn  order  to  accomplish  this  objective,  NMCD  shall  notify \ncaseworkers in all medium security facilities of the need to evaluate \nlikely candidates for reclassification and reassignment as promptly \nas possible, consistent with the normal and efficient operation of the \nclassification process. \n2.  Only dayrooms in general population medium or minimum security \nhousing units are utilized to house prisoners; provided, however, \nthat dayrooms in the Reception and Diagnostic Centers for male and \nfemale inmates may be used to house prisoners whose preliminary \nclassification  review  by  someone  trained  in  classification \nprocedures  indicates  that  those  prisoners  can  be  housed \nappropriately in a dayroom setting. This review shall consist, at a \nminimum, of (a) the assignment of the prisoner to a cell for a period \nof at least three days prior to the prisoner's assignment to a dayroom, \n(b)  an opportunity  for  the  prisoner  to  meet privately  with  the \nclassification person to discuss any concerns the prisoner may have \n5 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 6 of 15\nconcerning the prisoner's possible assignment to a dayroom, and (c) \na documented preliminary determination that the prisoner can be \nhoused appropriately in a dayroom. \n3.  No more than five prisoners per dayroom  shall be assigned to \ndayrooms in any facility and the dayroom housing must provide a \nminimum of 50 square feet of combined living and sleeping space \nper inmate (excluding the cell left open for hygiene, as set forth \nbelow). \n4.  One cell in any pod in which prisoners are housed in the dayroom \nmust be vacated so that the hygiene facilities in that cell are available \nfor use by prisoners housed in the dayroom. This provision shall not \napply if the prisoners housed in the dayroom have direct access \nwithout assistance from a staff member to suitable hygiene facilities \nat all times. \n5.  No individual prisoner is housed in a dayroom for more than 120 \nconsecutive days. \n6.  No general  population  prisoner classified as maximum or close \ncustody is housed in a dayroom. \n111.  NMCD may not house more than 120% of the design capacity at a particular \nfacility. NMCD may not house a total of more than 500 prisoners for the \nentire prison system in dayrooms. \ntv.  Whenever NMCD houses inmates in dayrooms pursuant to this Revised \nSettlement Agreement, NMCD shall notify Plaintiffs'  counsel in writing \n6 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 7 of 15\nprior to doing so if reasonably possible and in no event later than the 10 1\nh \nday of the month following the housing of inmates in dayrooms. \ne.  Notwithstanding any  other provisions in this  Revised  Settlement Agreement, \nDefendants shall not make a motion for substantial compliance with subparagraphs \n(l)(a),  (c)  or (d)  unless  and  until  they  have  been  found  to  be in substantial \ncompliance with respect to all provisions of subparagraph ( 1) (b). \n2.  NMCD has initiated a study, which is being performed by the Institute for Social Research \n(\"ISR\"). The ISR study is assessing the potential benefits of revising the classification \nprocess,  including  establishing  separate  classification  systems  for  male  and  female \ninmates. NMCD will ensure that the ISR study is completed and implemented and will pay \nDr. James Austin his hourly rate of $175 per hour, up to $20,000, to provide input to ISR \non these matters. Compliance with this provision is established upon the completion and \nsubstantial implementation of the ISR study. Plaintiffs and Defendants may agree that \nNMCD has complied with this provision and submit a stipulated order to that effect.  In \nthe event that Defendants have been found to be in sustained compliance with all other \nprovisions of this Revised Settlement Agreement except this paragraph 2, then Plaintiffs' \ncounsel will limit their monitoring relating to this Revised Settlement Agreement to matters \ndirectly related to the completion and implementation of the ISR study. \n3.  NMCD will conduct at least two hiring fairs and host at least one satellite academy, which \nshall be undertaken in different locations around the state,  in each of the two  years \nfollowing the date of the Court's final approval of this Revised Settlement Agreement. \n4.  To decrease staff vacancies, within three months of the entry of this Court's final approval \norder, NMCD will adopt new hiring policies that reevaluate the physical fitness needs for \n7 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 8 of 15\nvarious positions with a goal towards enlarging the applicant pool. These new policies will \nbe provided to the Plaintiffs and to the Court. \n5.  Within three months of the entry ofthis Court's final approval order, and consistent with \nthe limitations provided in NMSA 1978, §§ 33-2-34 (E) and (F), NMCD will allow inmates \nto receive one month good time lump sum awards (\"LSAs\") for each individual stage of \nthe Residential Drug Abuse Program. The stages of this program currently include: (1) \nOrientation and Rational Thinking; (2) Criminal Lifestyle-Living With Others; and (3) \nRecovery, Maintenance, and Transition Living. \n6.  Within three months of the entry of this Court's final approval order, NMCD will modify \nits LSA policy prohibiting inmates who are within 90 days of their release date from being \nawarded LSAs. Inmates who are 45 days or more from their release date shall be eligible \nfor LSAs. \n7.  NMCD will meet American Correctional Association (\"ACA\") standards regarding toilet \nto-inmate ratios, and will ensure toilets are working within 48 hours of a verbal or written \ninmate complaint regarding plumbing problems. NMCD shall not seek a waiver of these \nrequirements from the ACA. \n8.  NMCD will meet ACA standards regarding shower-to-inmate ratios. NMCD shall not seek \na waiver of these requirements from the ACA. \n9.  NMCD will ensure there is an adequate supply of safe drinking water at the Springer \nCorrectional Center. This provision is intended to address those situations in which the \nlocal municipality has raised concerns regarding the quality ofthe municipal water supply. \nIf the municipal water supply is unsafe or inadequate, NMCD will provide inmates with \nbottled water. \n8 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 9 of 15\n10.  NMCD will retain professionally licensed exterminators to be deployed at least monthly \nfor the duration of this Revised Settlement Agreement at WNMCF and NWNMCF to \nmitigate concerns about rodents and vermin at the facilities. \n11.  Within eighteen months of the entry oft his Court's final approval order, NMCD will retrain \nrecords staff regarding file audit reviews and good time calculations to  improve the \naccuracy of those reviews and calculations. NMCD will provide a copy of the training \nmaterials to Plaintiffs' counsel and provide regular updates to Plaintiffs' counsel regarding \nthe progress of this training until it is completed. Plaintiffs may not approve or disapprove \nof these training materials. This provision is satisfied once all records staff have been \nretrained. \n12.  The Classification Supervisor will ensure that the Parole Board Docket Form is accurate \nand that it, along with the Parole Plan, is submitted to the Adult Parole Board (\"Board\") \nvia e-mail no later than 90 days prior to a class member's projected release date for class \nmembers that will serve parole in New Mexico and no later than 120 days prior to the class \nmember's projected release date ifthe class member will serve parole out of state. NMCD \nwill ensure that class members are timely released on their certified release date following \nreceipt of parole board certificate and, where applicable, when there is available space at a \nhalfway  house,  transitional  living  center,  or  long-term  residential  treatment center. \nSubstantial compliance with this provision means that NMCD complies with the provisions \nof this section at least 85% of the time. Beginning no later than thirty days after the entry \nof this Court's final approval order, NMCD will provide Plaintiffs' counsel with monthly \nreports documenting production oft he Parole Board Docket Form, Parole Plan, and release \ndate for all class members. \n9 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 10 of 15\n13.  NMCD will not take away good time or otherwise discipline class members for reporting \nin good faith alleged PREA violations, as provided in PREA Standard 28 C.F.R.115.78(f). \nHowever, NMCD does not waive its rights under PREA Standard 28 C.F.R. 115.52(g). \n14.  All  men  confined  to  a  medium  or  higher  custody  facility  and  all  women  of any \nclassification level in NMCD custody will receive the benefits of this Revised Settlement \nAgreement. \n15.  Medical/Geriatric Parole-NMCD shall identify geriatric, permanently incapacitated, and \nterminally  ill class members  eligible  for  geriatric  or medical  parole  based  on rules \nestablished by the Board and give notice to those inmates no later than December 31, 2019 \nand on an annual basis thereafter. NMCD shall forward an application and documentation \nin support of parole eligibility to the Board within thirty days of receipt of an application \nfrom a class member. The documentation shall include information concerning the class \nmember's age, medical history and prognosis, institutional behavior and adjustment and \ncriminal history. The class member or his or her representative may submit an application \nto the Board. NMCD will adhere to these provisions for the duration of this Revised \nSettlement Agreement. \n16.  With respect to any parolee who is a class member at the time he or she is released, who \ncomes under the supervision of the probation and parole department, and serves one-half \nof his or her required parole time without a major violation, NMCD will provide a written \nrecommendation to the Board that such parolee's parole time be reduced by one-half. This \nprovision is not intended to expand the scope of the class and does not apply to: \na.  Sex offenders; \nb.  Serious violent offenders; and \n10 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 11 of 15\nc.  Offenders who are serving sentences for a DWI sixth or higher. \n17.  As remedial relief, NMCD agrees to award one month's worth of good time consistent with \nNMSA 1978, § 33-2-34(A) (2015) to the following inmates:  (1) any inmate who was \nhoused for at least 60 days in dormitories at NWNMCF from March 1, 20 14 until the date \nthe Court :finds that Defendants are in substantial compliance with subparagraph (1 )(b) (i) \nof this Revised Settlement Agreement; (2) any inmate who was housed for at least 60 days \nat SCC from  October  1, 2016 until the date the  Court fmds  that Defendants are in \nsubstantial compliance with subparagraph (l)(b)(ii) ofthis Revised Settlement Agreement; \n(3) any inmate housed for at least 60 days in dormitories at WNMCF from October 1, 2016 \nuntil the date the Court :finds Defendants are in substantial compliance with subparagraph \n(l)(b)(iii) of this Revised Settlement Agreement; and (4) any inmate housed for at least 60 \ndays in dormitories at OCPF from October 1, 2016 until the date the Court :finds Defendants \nare in substantial compliance with subparagraph  (1)(b)(iv) of this Revised Settlement \nAgreement.

The parties agree to collaborate in the exchange of information necessary to ensure the \nDefendants' compliance with and the expeditious resolution of this Revised Settlement \nAgreement.  Where  absolutely  necessary,  and  only  after  conferring with  Defendants, \nPlaintiffs may seek formal discovery through specific requests that address the terms of \nthis Revised Settlement Agreement. The Defendants do not relinquish their right to object \nor otherwise seek limitations to the proffered discovery. Any dispute regarding discovery \nwill be resolved by the Court. \n21.  When the Defendants believe they have substantially complied with any of the items set \nforth in this Revised Settlement Agreement, they will notify the Plaintiffs in writing. The \nnotice will state the basis for asserting substantial compliance. At any time after thirty days \nfrom this notice, the Defendants may file a motion for a finding of substantial compliance \nas to the item(s) addressed in the notice. If the motion is contested, the parties will request \nthat the Court hold a hearing and enter its findings and conclusions. If the Court determines \nthat the Defendants have substantially complied with the item(s) ofthis Revised Settlement \nAgreement  to  which  the  motion  pertains,  it will  enter  an  order  finding  substantial \ncompliance as to the item(s) to which the motion pertains. IfDefendants maintain sustained \ncompliance for 6 months from the date of the Court's order finding substantial compliance, \nand the Defendants' sustained compliance is unchallenged, the Court's will enter an order \n12 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 13 of 15\nterminating  its  oversight of and disengaging  such item(s). If the Plaintiffs challenge \nDefendants' proffer of sustained compliance, the Court will resolve the dispute after a \nhearing. Upon a determination of sustained compliance as to an item and the Court's \nresulting  termination  of the  oversight of and  disengagement  of that  item,  either  by \nagreement of the parties or as a result of the Court's determination, the Defendants will no \nlonger be required to report on that item or compensate the Plaintiffs for attorney, paralegal, \nor investigator time spent monitoring that item. \n22.  Upon the Court's termination of its oversight of and the disengagement of all of the items \nin this Revised Settlement Agreement, Defendants will be deemed to have complied with \nthe  terms  of this  Revised  Settlement Agreement and  all  provisions  of the  Revised \nSettlement Agreement and all prior consent decrees will be vacated. \n23.  Defendants agree not to file a motion to terminate pursuant to the PLRA until they have \nachieved sustained compliance with the provisions of this Revised Settlement Agreement, \nas provided in Section 21. Plaintiffs agree not to seek expansion of this Revised Settlement \nAgreement or to monitor facilities beyond the scope of this Revised Settlement Agreement. \n24.  Plaintiffs agree that NMCD has no authority over the Adult Parole Board and do not now, \nand will not in the future, make any claims that this Revised Settlement Agreement is being \nviolated due to the conduct, actions, or decisions of the Board. \n25.  The parties agree not to move to modify this Revised Settlement Agreement. \n26.  Plaintiffs' counsel reserve the right to argue for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses \nincurred for their reasonable and necessary work in negotiating and securing this Revised \nSettlement Agreement, as well as any attorneys' fees and expenses for prior work in this \nlitigation, and Defendants reserve the right to object to those attorneys' fees and expenses. \n13 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 14 of 15\n27.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction over any dispute that may arise with respect to the \ninterpretation or enforcement of this Revised Settlement Agreement. The parties agree that \nif a dispute arises regarding interpretation or enforcement of this Revised  Settlement \nAgreement, they must first confer prior to filing any motion. Except, in the case of an \nemergency, a party may file an emergency motion. \n28.  Based upon the entire record, the parties stipulate and jointly request that the Court find \nthat the relief set forth in this Revised Settlement Agreement is narrowly drawn, extends \nno further than necessary to correct the violation of Plaintiffs' federal rights, and is the least \nintrusive means necessary to correct the violation of Plaintiffs' federal rights. \n29.  Plaintiffs  agree that this  Revised  Settlement Agreement  constitutes the  entire  set of \nobligations and duties necessary for Defendants' full release from this litigation and all \nattendant Court orders in both the Duran and Klatt lawsuits. \n30.  The intention of this Revised Settlement Agreement is to allow for final resolution of this \nlitigation and to allow Defendants to dissolve the consent decree in this litigation. \n14 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200-1   Filed 02/10/20   Page 15 of 15\nExecuted: Februaty I 0, 2020 \n:=&\\. \nh  };;;A \n(\\'o  t \n1 \n~a \nFreedman Smith \nLAW OFFICE OF ALEXANDRA \nFREEDMAN SMITH, LLC \n11¢L  -_ \na  enne  oewe \nLAW OFFICE OF RYAN J.

No later than October 1, 2016, the Defendants will remove from all cells \nat WNMCF all additional bunks that were bolted onto the walls in any cell at \nWNMCF after the entry of the 1991 settlement agreement. \nII.  PROCESS  FOR  REVIEWING  LOSS/RESTORATION  OF  GOOD-TIME \nCREDITS FOR DOUBLE-CELLED INMATES \nA.  Within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  complete  execution  of  this  settlement \nagreement, Defendants shall retrieve and review their records and determine \nwhich inmates (1) were double-celled in a single occupancy cell at WNMCF \nand (2) remain in Defendants' custody. \nB.  For  each  inmate  meeting  both  of the  criteria  identified  in  II(A)  above, \nDefendants shall within an additional thirty (30) days review that inmate's \nclassification file to determine whether the inmate lost any good-time credits \nthat had previously been awarded to the inmate. For any inmate who meets \nboth of the criteria identified in II( A) and who lost any good-time credits for \nactions that occurred during the time he was double-celled, Defendants shall \nthen determine whether that loss of good time was reasonably related to that \ninmate being placed in double-cell housing in a single occupancy cell.  If there \n2 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2769   Filed 08/31/16   Page 3 of 5\nis a reasonable relation between an inmate's loss of good time and that inmate \nhaving been assigned to  a double cell, Defendants agree to restore all such \ngood time to that individual inmate, within thirty (30) days of completing the \nabove-described file review. \nC.  If Defendants determine that an inmate (1) was double-celled, (2) remains in \nDefendants'  custody and (3)  lost good-time credit for actions that occurred \nduring  the  time  he  was  double-celled  in  a  single  occupancy  cell,  but \nDefendants nonetheless determine that there is not a reasonable relationship \nbetween that inmate's loss of good-time credit and having been assigned to \ndouble-cell housing, Defendants agree to inform Plaintiffs' counsel within ten \n(1 0) days of each such determination and to provide Plaintiffs' counsel with \nall relevant file materials relating to that determination. \nD.  Plaintiffs  and  Defendants,  through  their respective  counsel,  will  meet and \nconfer in good faith about any inmates whose entitlement to restoration of \ngood-time credits under this  Settlement Agreement remains in dispute.  If \nafter this conferral the parties remain in disagreement about whether there is a \nreasonable relation between the loss of an eligible inmate's good-time credit \nand that inmate having been assigned to  a double cell, the parties agree to \nsubmit the issue to the Court for determination. \nIII. GENERAL PROVISIONS \nA.  Upon execution by all parties, the parties will file this Settlement Agreement \nwith the Court for the Court's review and approval. \n3 \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2769   Filed 08/31/16   Page 4 of 5\nB.  Plaintiffs will withdraw their Motion for Emergency Relief within ten (1 0) \ndays from the Court's entry of an order approving this Settlement Agreement. \nPlaintiffs  agree  that  Sections  I and  II  of this  Settlement Agreement  fully \nresolve any claims for remedial relief that were raised in Plaintiffs' Motion for \nEmergency Relief. \nC.  This  Settlement Agreement was  voluntarily and  mutually agreed upon  by \nPlaintiffs and Defendants as a compromised settlement of a dispute between \nthe parties.  This Settlement Agreement does not constitute an admission that \nany previous or existing condition, policy, procedure, act or omission of the \nDefendants or of any official,  employee or agent of Defendants was  or is \nimproper, negligent, unconstitutional, or otherwise in violation of any right of \nPlaintiffs. \nD.  This  Settlement  Agreement  was  the  product  of negotiations  between  the \nparties  and  their  counsel  and  reflects  input  from  both  parties.  Neither \nPlaintiffs nor Defendants shall be deemed to be the drafter of this Settlement \nAgreement for purposes of construction and interpretation. \nE.  By entering into this Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs do not waive any claim \nfor  attorneys'  fees  incurred  in  connection with the Motion for  Emergency \nRelief, and Defendants do not waive any objection or opposition to any such \nclaim for attorneys' fees. \nF.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction over any dispute that may arise with respect \nto the interpretation or enforcement of this Settlement Agreement. \n4 \n\n,,  . \nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KG-KK   Document 2769   Filed 08/31/16   Page 5 of 5\nSignature Page--Settlement Agreement-Duran v.

Our study of the matter convinces us that the\ndistrict court did not err in denying defendants' motion to vacate. Accordingly, we affirm.\nBy a first amended complaint filed July 6, 1978, Dwight Duran, and others, all inmates of the Penitentiary of New\nMexico (\"PNM\"), instituted a class action charging that conditions in the penitentiary violated rights guaranteed\n[2]\nthem by the United States Constitution and by federal statutes.  Jurisdiction was based on 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\nNamed as defendants were the following:\n1. Hon. Jerry Apodaca, Governor of the State of New Mexico;\n[3]\n2. Charles Becknell, Secretary of Criminal Justice for the State of New Mexico;\n3. Edwin Mahr, Director of the Corrections Division for the State of New Mexico;\n\n4. Levi Romero, Warden of the Penitentiary of New Mexico;\n5. Robert Montoya, a Deputy Warden of the Penitentiary of New Mexico; and\n[4]\n6. Joseph Lujan, a Deputy Warden of the Penitentiary of New Mexico.\nPartial consent agreements, covering visitation, access to legal services, and food services, were signed by the\nparties in 1979, and orders reflecting the agreements were entered by the court. Those partial consent decrees\nare not the subject of this appeal. In February, 1980, a bloody riot occurred in the Penitentiary of New Mexico in\nwhich twelve correctional officers were taken hostage, thirty-three inmates were killed, at least ninety were\nseriously injured, and damage to the prison facilities measured in the millions of dollars.\nIn this general setting the parties entered into a consent decree which was approved by the district court on July\n14, 1980. This negotiated decree was elaborate, extending well over 100 printed pages, and by its provisions\nregulated many aspects of the prison operation. In provisions not challenged in the present proceeding, the\ndecree comprehensively regulates the defendants' conduct in the penitentiary in the area of (1) food services, (2)\nphysical facilities, including clothing and personal hygiene items provided to inmates, (3) medical care, (4) mental\nhealth care, (5) correspondence between inmates and outsiders, (6) access to legal resources, and (7) attorney-\nclient visitations.\nOn June 12, 1987, the Attorney General for the State of New Mexico filed a motion to vacate seven parts of the\n[5]\n1980 consent decree.  The motion was filed on behalf of the Hon. Garrey Carruthers, who was then the\n1487 Governor of New Mexico, and on behalf *1487 of the other individuals named as defendants in the amended\ncomplaint, or their successors. The motion to vacate was signed not only by the state's Attorney General, but also\nby private counsel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Washington, D.C.\nSpecifically, the defendants moved to vacate the following portions of the 1980 consent decree:\n[6]\n1. Paragraph 6 in the July 14, 1980 Agreement, except for the first sentence.\n2. Paragraphs 1 through 15 in the \"Classification\" section of the consent decree.\n3. Paragraphs 1 through 10, except for the first sentence of paragraph 7 and the second sentence of paragraph\n10 and paragraph 11(f) in the \"Maximum Security\" section of the decree.\n4. Paragraphs 1 through 11 and 14 through 18 of the \"Inmate Discipline\" section of the decree.\n5. Paragraphs 1 through 7, 9 through 12, 14 through 18 and the prologue of the \"Inmate Activity\" section of the\ndecree.\n6. Paragraphs 1, 2, 4(A) and 4(M), except as they apply to inmates housed in the PNM-Main, or facilities\noperated for specialized mental-health care, maximum security or disciplinary segregation, paragraph 8, as it\napplies to provision of cigarettes and tobacco, and paragraph 11 as such appears in the \"Living Conditions\"\nsection of the decree.\n7. Paragraphs 1 through 10, 11(E), 13 through 15, plus the probable cause provision in paragraph 11(D) and the\nprobable cause and reasonable suspicion requirements in paragraph 12 in the \"Visitation\" section of the decree.\n[7]\nDefendants' basic position is that the portions of the consent decree which they seek to vacate are not directly\nrelated to federally created rights nor do they tend to vindicate federal rights. Rather, the defendants argue that at\nbest they may relate to, and vindicate, rights created by the State of New Mexico, and that some others relate\nonly to better penological practices. Such remedies, according to the defendants, are beyond the reach of a\nfederal district court, and should therefore be removed from the consent decree. In this argument, defendants\nplace considerable reliance on Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900,\n79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), where the Supreme Court held that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited a federal district\ncourt from ordering state officials to conform their conduct to state law.\n\nAt the outset it should be remembered that in the instant case there was no trial. We have a first amended\n1488 complaint filed *1488 July 6, 1978, followed by several partial consent decrees in 1979, culminating in an\nelaborate and all-encompassing final consent decree on July 14, 1980. Consequently, the first amended\ncomplaint should be our starting point.\nIn a \"preliminary statement\" to the first amended complaint the plaintiffs contend that \"the totality of the\novercrowding and other conditions at PNM fall beneath standards of human decency, inflict needless suffering on\nprisoners and create an environment which threatens prisoners' mental and physical well-being and results in\nphysical and mental deterioration and dehabilitation of the prisoners confined therein, which is both unnecessary\nand penologically unjustifiable.\" By further prefatory statement, the plaintiffs asked the district court, after hearing,\nto declare that the totality of prison conditions are unconstitutional under the Constitutions of the United States\nand New Mexico and in violation of the statutes of the United States and New Mexico.\nThe plaintiffs' first claim for relief was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress injuries suffered by the plaintiffs,\nand the class they sought to represent, for deprivation by the defendants of rights secured the plaintiffs by the\nfirst, sixth, eighth, ninth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. Specific constitutional\nrights allegedly violated by the defendant were the rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, to due\nprocess, to religious freedom, to freedom of expression and association, to have access to courts, to privacy, and\nto equal protection.\nA second claim for relief was based on Article II, section 13 of the New Mexico Constitution prohibiting cruel and\nunusual punishment. It was also alleged in the second claim for relief that the conditions at the penitentiary\nviolated plaintiffs' rights to freedom of speech, religion, equal protection, due process, and other rights\nguaranteed by Article II, sections 11, 17, and 18 of the New Mexico Constitution.\nIn their third claim for relief, the plaintiffs alleged that the several defendants had failed to exercise their duties to\noperate the penitentiary in accord with Article II, section 4 of the New Mexico Constitution and N.M.Stat.Ann. §§\n44-1-38, 42-1-1.1, 42-1-31.2, 42-9-6(G), and 42-9-6(H).\nThe fourth claim for relief was based on provisions of the United States Law Enforcement Assistance\nAdministration, 42 U.S.C. § 3750b, with the plaintiffs claiming that they were third party beneficiaries under\ncontractual arrangements between the Administration and the defendants.\nUnder the section heading \"Factual Allegations,\" the plaintiffs set forth in the first amended complaint the facts\nunderlying all of their several claims for relief. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the penitentiary was \"grossly and\ninhumanely overcrowded.\" According to the first amended complaint, some of the prisoners were forced to live in\ncells which were approximately 6' x 9' in size, with two or more persons being housed in one cell, and that the\nmajority of the prisoners were housed in dormitories which were overcrowded, filthy and impossible to keep\nclean. Such overcrowding, plaintiffs alleged, destroyed any possibility of privacy and rendered the quarters unfit\nfor human habitation because of mice, roaches, vermin, clogged toilets, and the like.\nThe plaintiffs also complained about food service, physical and sexual assaults by other prisoners, understaffed\nprofessional, educational and security personnel, improper classification of inmates according to their\neducational, vocational and health needs, lack of meaningful industrial or institutional employment, inadequate\nrecreational activities, unduly restrictive visitation rights and correspondence policies, inadequate medical and\ndental care, lack of access to legal books and resources, and disciplinary proceedings that were devoid of due\nprocess.\nBased upon the factual allegations, the plaintiffs sought class action certification, a declaratory judgment that the\n\"totality of the conditions\" at the penitentiary violated the rights of the plaintiffs established by the constitutions of\nthe United States and of New Mexico and by both federal and local state statutes, and a preliminary and\n1489 permanent injunction directing the defendants *1489 to comply with the various constitutional and statutory\nmandates. The plaintiffs also sought to require the defendants to pay the costs of the action, including attorneys'\nfees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\nAs above stated, the parties submitted several partial consent decrees to the district court in 1979, and orders\nwere entered in accord with the matters agreed to by the parties. And on July 14, 1980, a final consent decree\nwas entered by the court reflecting the agreements between the parties. These orders covered such items as\ncorrespondence policies and practices, attorney-prisoner visitations, food service, inmate legal access, visitation\nrights, classification of inmates, living conditions, inmate activity, medical care, mental health care, staffing and\ntraining of prison personnel, maximum security classification, and inmate discipline procedure.\nA prefatory statement in the final consent decree stated that the agreement was voluntarily and mutually agreed\nupon as a compromise settlement of the dispute between the parties. Another statement in the final agreement\nbetween the parties read as follows:\nThose policy statements and the partial consent decrees on file herein may include specific\nrequirements and procedures beyond what is required by the Constitution of the United States,\nthe Constitution of the State of New Mexico, the federal Civil Rights Act, the New Mexico Torts\nClaim Act, or any other constitutional, statutory or common law requirement.\n[8]\nArticle XI of the United States Constitution  provides as follows:\nThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or in\nequity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another state or\nby Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\nA literal reading of the eleventh amendment would appear to bar only suits against a state by a citizen of another\nstate. However, it has been interpreted to also bar suits against a state brought by its own citizens. Hans v.\nLouisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890). In the instant case, the plaintiffs are citizens of New\nMexico, and the State of New Mexico, as such, is not named as a defendant. The defendants are, however,\nvarious state officials, and the immunity granted in the eleventh amendment to the state bars a suit against a\nstate official when the suit is one which, in essence, would operate against the state. Edelman v. Jordan, 415\nU.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). However the eleventh amendment does not bar a suit in federal\ndistrict court against a state official seeking injunctive relief where the state official has allegedly violated federal\nlaw. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). The Eleventh Amendment does, however,\nprohibit a federal district court from granting injunctive relief against a state official who has allegedly violated only\nstate law, as opposed to federal law. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct.\n900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).\nIn the instant case, the plaintiffs instituted a suit against state officials alleging that they violated, inter alia, the\nfederal constitution and federal statutes. Under Ex parte Young, supra, the defendants under the eleventh\namendment are not immune from such a suit. Counsel agrees that those parts of the consent decree setting forth\nrules and regulations for prison conduct which are directly related to federally protected rights, or tend to\nvindicate those rights, are proper, and are not here challenged. However, it is counsel's further position that those\nparts of the consent decrees which defendants seek to have vacated represent remedies that are not directly\nrelated to federally protected rights, nor do they tend to vindicate such rights. With the latter proposition, we\ndisagree.\n1490 Arguably, the provisions which the defendants seek to vacate do relate to, or *1490 to vindicate, federally\nprotected rights. In addition, the defendants, by the consent decrees, waived their right to make plaintiffs\nestablish at trial that they were entitled to all the relief afforded them by the consent decrees. In this latter\nconnection, the Supreme Court, in Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 329, 48 S.Ct. 311, 316, 72 L.Ed.\n587 (1928), commented as follows:\nHere again, the defendants ignore the fact that by consenting to the entry of the decree, \"without\nany findings of fact,\" they left to the Court the power to construe the pleadings, and in so doing, to\nfind in them the existence of circumstances of danger which justified compelling the defendants to\nabandon all participation in these businesses, and to abstain from acquiring any interest hereafter.\n\nThe defendants' first request in their motion to vacate was that paragraph six in the 1980 consent decree be\nvacated, except for the first sentence thereof. See n. 3 supra. We regard paragraph six to concern procedure,\nrather than substance. It provides that no change which will lessen the benefits provided by the agreement and\ndecree may be made, and then goes on to outline the procedure to be followed when the defendants proposed to\n\"implement\" the decree, namely, 30 days notice to plaintiffs prior to any implementation, granting plaintiffs 15\ndays to file any objection to a proposed change, requiring the parties to attempt to informally resolve any dispute,\nand providing for unresolved matters to be resolved by the district court after a hearing wherein the defendants\nhave the burden of showing that the proposed change is just and will not lessen the benefits provided by the\ndecree. These procedural safeguards for the plaintiffs, which the defendants in the consent decree saw fit to\ngrant, attach to all the remedies provided in the decree, many of which defendants concede have a direct\nrelationship to federal rights and which are not challenged in this case. Such being the case, the district court, in\nour view, did not err in refusing to vacate paragraph six, as requested by the defendants.\nThe other parts of the consent decree which the defendants seek to have vacated relate to classification of\ninmates, maximum security, inmate discipline, inmate activity, living conditions, and inmate visitation rights. As\nindicated, it was, and is, the plaintiffs' position that it was the \"totality\" of the prison conditions, not necessarily any\none condition, which violated their federally protected rights. In our view, each of the matters which form the basis\nof this case is a part of that \"totality\" and does bear on, or tend to vindicate, federal rights. Further, by the 1980\nagreement and the consent decree based thereon, the defendants waived their right to trial. Quite conceivably, if\nthe case had gone to trial plaintiffs' evidence might well have established that the remedies now complained\n[9]\nabout are indeed tied to federal rights, or at least tend to vindicate such rights.  But the defendants voluntarily\nwaived their right to insist that the plaintiffs prove their case in open court.\nWe reject the defendants' argument that the Eleventh Amendment dictates the granting of their motion to vacate.\nAs indicated, counsel concedes that the district court had the jurisdiction and authority to grant relief to these\nplaintiffs against these defendants where prison conditions violated federal rights, be they constitutional or\n[10]\nstatutory. That concession wipes out much of the defendants' Eleventh Amendment argument.  In Local No.\n1491 93*1491v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986), the Supreme Court in a Title\nVII case, where a consent decree was entered, spoke as follows:\nAccordingly, a consent decree must spring from and serve to resolve a dispute within the court's\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, consistent with this requirement, the consent decree must\n\"com[e] within the general scope of the case made by the plaintiff ... and must further the\nobjectives of the law upon which the complaint was based.... However, in addition to the law which\nforms the basis for the claim, the parties' consent animates the legal force of a consent decree....\"\nTherefore, a federal court is not necessarily barred from entering a consent decree merely\nbecause the decree provides broader relief than the court could have awarded after trial (citations\nomitted).\nAs stated, central to defendants' argument is Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). Such reliance is in our view misplaced. The Supreme Court in Pennhurst\nheld that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited a federal district court from ordering state officials to conform their\n[11]\nconduct to state law.  That is not our case. Here, the district court ordered state officials to conform their\nconduct to federal law, and the provisions of the decree which the defendants seek to vacate tend to vindicate\nthose rights. And even if they didn't bear directly on federal rights, the provisions sought to be vacated come\nwithin the rule of Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland, supra, i.e., (1) the consent decree springs from and serves to\nresolve a dispute within the district court's subject matter jurisdiction; (2) the consent decree comes within the\n\"general scope\" of the case made by plaintiffs in the first amended complaint; and (3) furthers the objectives upon\nwhich the complaint is based, in which event \"the parties' consent animates the legal force of a consent decree\"\nand a district court is not barred from entering a consent decree providing broader relief than the court might\npossibly have been empowered to enter after trial.\nKozlowski v. Coughlin, 871 F.2d 241 (2d Cir.1989), resembles our case. In that case state officials appealed from\na consent decree which established procedures and sanctions governing the suspension and termination of\n\nprison visitation rights, arguing that the sanctions, unlike the procedures, in the decree were unrelated to the\nunderlying due process violation, and that accordingly the Eleventh Amendment barred subject matter\njurisdiction. A divided panel of the Second Circuit rejected that argument and spoke as follows:\nBefore entering a consent judgment, the district court must be certain that the decree 1) \"spring[s]\nfrom and serve[s] to resolve a dispute within the court's subject matter jurisdiction,\" 2) \"come[s]\nwithin the general scope of the case made by the pleading,\" and 3) \"further[s] the objectives of the\nlaw upon which the complaint was based.\" Firefighters,478 U.S. at 525 [106 S.Ct. at 3077] (other\ncitations omitted). These three conditions are sufficient even if the decree contains broader relief\n1492 than the court could have awarded after trial. *1492 Judgment affirmed.[12]\n[1] The district court's Memorandum Opinion and Order was published and appears as Duran v. Carruthers, 678\nF.Supp. 839 (D.N.M.1988). The background chronology is fully set forth therein and will not be repeated in great\ndetail here.\n[2] The first amended complaint also set forth in a second and third claim violations of the New Mexico state\nconstitution, and New Mexico state statute. A fourth claim for relief alleged violations of the United States Law\nEnforcement Assistance Administration, 42 U.S.C. § 3750b. However, none of these claims plays any role in the\npresent proceeding.\n[3] The Secretary of Criminal Justice is appointed by the Governor.\n[4] All defendants were represented in the district court by the Attorney General for New Mexico.\n[5] An earlier motion to vacate the 1980 consent decree in its entirety was withdrawn.\n[6] 6. Other than in times of emergency, changed circumstances may, in the future, justify some changes in this\nagreement and the policies attached hereto and the partial consent decrees on file herein. No change or changes\nmay be made which will lessen the benefits provided by the agreement and the policies attached hereto and the\npartial consent decrees on file herein. Notice will be given to the lawyers for the Plaintiffs at least thirty (30) days\nprior to the proposed implementation date. Said notice will contain the proposed change or changes and the\nreasons therefore. Counsel for the Plaintiffs will ascertain whether, in their opinion, the proposed change or\nchanges in any way lessen the benefits provided by this agreement or the policies attached hereto and the partial\nconsent decrees on file herein. If so, they will notify Defendants of their objections and the reasons therefore\nwithin fifteen (15) days. Efforts will be made to informally resolve the matter. If the dispute cannot be resolved, it\nwill be submitted to the court. The burden will then be on the Defendants to justify that the change or changes\nshould be made and will not lessen the benefits provided by the agreement and the policies attached hereto and\nthe partial consent decrees on file herein before the change or changes will be allowed.\n[7] In greater detail, the contested provisions (1) requires appellants to follow specified procedures and criteria in\nclassifying inmates to different security levels, and severely restricts both the amount of time and the\ncircumstances in which they may use the \"maximum security\" classification; (2) sets out the exclusive list of\nactions that may form the basis for inmate discipline, as well as the maximum penalties; (3) mandates that eight\nhours of vocational or educational activity per day be made available to each inmate; (4) prohibits, in all prisons\nand under all circumstances, the housing of two inmates in the same cell; and (5) comprehensively regulates the\nprison policies on visitations, including the types of searches that may be made in relation to such visits.\n[8] The eleventh amendment was adopted in response to Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 4A (1793) which allowed a\nsuit by two South Carolinians, on behalf of a British subject, against the State of Georgia.\n[9] Such a \"totality of the circumstances\" approach was approved by the Supreme Court in Hutto v. Finney, 437\nU.S. 678, 685-89, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2570-73, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978).\n[10] Indeed, there is ample authority for finding that each of the contested sections vindicates a federal right. In \nRamos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559 (10th Cir.1980),cert. denied,450 U.S. 1041, 101 S.Ct. 1759, 68 L.Ed.2d 239\n(1981), this court reaffirmed that there is a constitutional right to be reasonably protected from constant threats of\n\nviolence and sexual assaults from other prisoners. More specifically, this court indicated that, although such a\nremedy was not warranted under the facts in Ramos, there may be a point where motility, classification, and\nidleness could constitute an actual violation of the eighth amendment. Id. at 566-67. \nSimilarly, the provisions regarding inmate visitation do not go beyond what could be ordered by a court. See Pell\nv. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974). Indeed, in 1984 the Department of Corrections'\nown analysis of the visitation provisions reached the conclusion that the decree did not go beyond those visitation\nrights that could be constitutionally imposed in its absence. Attachment A to Plaintiff's Supplemental Response to\nDefendant's Motion to Vacate or Modify the Judgment, filed 1/6/86.\nAll of the other contested provisions may be similarly justified. See Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 101 S.Ct.\n2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (overcrowding may be a constitutional violation); Ruiz v. Estelle, 679 F.2d 1115 (5th\nCir.1952) (court may impose prophylactic rules to prevent repetition of constitutional violations).\nHowever, it must be noted that the contested provisions should not be viewed in isolation, but rather as part of\nthe \"totality of the circumstances\" existing at PNM. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522\n(1978).\n[11] In Pennhurst, judgment was entered after a \"lengthy trial\" and did not, as here, involve a consent decree.\n[12] The present appeal concerns only the propriety of the district court's order denying defendants' motion to\nvacate parts of the 1980 consent decree. We are not here concerned with defendants' right, if any, to have\n\"equitable modification\" of that decree.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

In providing that\ni¡  :\n\\¦ assessment, the Special Master will set out all of the facts that\n11 lead to his conclusion, including facts relating to the\ni  '\n¦i following:  achievement  of  the  targets  in  Exhibit  \"A\";  attainment\n¡¡\n¦! of the provisions of the Defendants' Inmate Activity Plan,\nI ¦\ni i\n! including the temporal reference points established by that plan;\n¡¡ the establishment of staffing patterns and plans for hiring of\nij\n¦¡ additional staff; analysis of physical plant improvement projects\n¡¡\n¦¦ and establishment of meaningful activities, including work,\n\neducation, recreation, and other programs to accommodate the\n¦` requirements of at least eight (8) hours a day of meaningful\n!!

Plaintiffs i\n, agree that they will file no motion or response to any Special\n:\nMaster's report that establishes that Defendants have achieved\nsubstantial compliance or are making satisfactory progress toward ;\nachieving substantial compliance by July 1, 1995.\nIf the Special Master finds in the preliminary version\nof any quarterly report that the Defendants are not making  ¦\nsatisfactory progress toward achieving substantial compliance by |\n¡\nJuly 1, 1995, he will consult with the parties about the specific\ni\ntasks that Defendants must undertake to achieve satisfactory  ;\nprogress, and he will identify those tasks in the final version  \\\n¡\nof his report.  The Special Master also will describe in the  ¦\nfinal version of any such report the steps Defendants have taken '\nor have agreed to take to attain an appropriate level of\nprogress.  He will append to the final version of any such report |\n¡\nany plans prepared by Defendants that address the tasks to be  ¡\ni\naccomplished and describe the actions Defendants intend to take  i\nto complete those tasks.  ¡\nIf the final version of any quarterly report  j\nestablishes that Defendants have not achieved satisfactory\nprogress, and reflects that Defendants have failed to take all\n\nnecessary steps to achieve timely substantial compliance,\nPlaintiffs will be free to take whatever legal action, including\nI\nfiling any motion, they deem appropriate.  The parties agree that,\nany report of the Special Master may be used by either party as  ¦\nevidence in any proceeding brought under this paragraph, but they\nfurther agree that the Special Master's reports will not be\ndeemed conclusive evidence of Defendants' violation of this\nStipulation or the Modified Decree.  The final version of any\nquarterly- report shall be filed no later than thirty  (30) days\nfrom the end of the quarter.\n2.  The First Stipulation on Inmate Activity, filed\nFebruary 24, 1994, provides that the parties will jointly develop!\nan Inmate Activity Plan (\"Plan\") to facilitate the Defendants'\ncompliance with the inmate activity provisions of the Modified\nDecree.  The Plan provides, in part, for the institution of\ninmate work details.  See, Inmate Activity Plan filed April 22,\n1994.  Work details, including those already in existence, must\nprovide meaningful activity in accordance with the provisions of j\nthe Modified Decree.  In the quarterly audits described in\nparagraph 1, the Special Master shall periodically monitor a  ;\nsufficient number of work details to determine whether they  ,\nprovide meaningful activity in accordance with the Modified\nDecree.  The Special Master shall document his findings  I\nconcerning the work details in his quarterly reports.  The  \\\n¡i monitoring and reporting concerning work details shall continue\nii\n  :\n11 until July 1, 1995.\ni!\n\n3.  To the extent that intentional actions of class members\nimpede or are intended to impede or prohibit compliance with this I\ni  ¡\ni¡ Stipulation, Defendants shall not be in non-compliance with this ¡\n!¡ Stipulation.  i\n4.  The Defendants warrant that, based on the Inmate  !\nActivity Plan filed April 22, 1994, barring construction delays, ¡\nf\nlabor disputes,  riot, fire or similar event, they have the\nfinancial resources available with monies appropriated for the  ¡\nÐuran case in the 1994 legislative session to achieve substantial ``\ncompliance with the policy statement on inmate activity of the  ,\ni\nModified Decree by July 1, 1995.  j\n5.  Beginning no later than May 1, 1994, all inmates newly j\nI\nassigned to the Penitentiary of New Mexico will be given the\nopportunity to be assessed by appropriate staff, using\nappropriate instruments, techniques, a review of existing RDC\ndata and the inmate's interest, in order to determine their\neducational, vocational education and work-related needs,\ninterests and goals in connection with the development and\nimplementation of the Inmate Activity Plan as outlined below:\n(a)  All inmates newly assigned to the Penitentiary of\nNew Mexico will have been given the opportunity to take the TABE\nLocator at RDC and the TABE at the Penitentiary.\n(b)  Newly assigned inmates will be given a\npresentation concerning educational, vocational education and\nwork offerings and processes during the intake orientation at\nPNM.\n\n(c)  All Inmate Literacy Program  (ILP) eligible inmates\nwill be interviewed and given interest surveys; the educational\nfile will be reviewed.  Further testing will be conducted if\nthere is a referral or functional need demonstrated.\n(d)  Non-ILP inmates who express an interest in\neducational programming will be interviewed and given interest\nsurveys; the educational file will be reviewed.  Further testing I\nwill be conducted if there is a referral or functional need  ·\ndemonstrated.\ni\n(e)  Inmates will not be required to participate in ILP j\nif they are exempt due to a medical, developmental or learning\n¦\n| disability as determined pursuant to- Correction Department\npolicies CD-102000 and CD-102001 and §33-11-1 et seq. NMSA.  ¡\n6.  By September 15, 1994, a sample of the current  j\npopulation necessary to determine appropriate activity  ;\nassessments for all inmates as required by the Modified Decree  j\nwill be assessed using the same model as that for newly assigned ¦\ni\ninmates.\n7.  Inmates who are. assigned to the ILP in conjunction with¡\nj\nimplementation of the Plan will not be required to relinquish  ¡\ntheir job assignments as a result of assignment to the ILP, but  ¦\ni\ninstead will be assigned to an ILP class during non-working hours j\ni\nwith the following exceptions:  j\n(a)  Any inmate who has been assigned to a job for less;\nthan six (6) months.  ;\n(b)  Any inmate who has voluntarily left a job  ¡\nassignment.  ¦\n\n¦  (c)  Any inmate who has been removed for misconduct or ¡\n|  j\n! failure to perform a job satisfactorily.  ¡\ni  ¦\n¦j  (d)  Any inmate who has been transferred from one  .\n¡I!I facility to another so long as the transfer is not for the  !\npurposes of placement in ILP.  j\ni\n(e)  Any inmate who has been placed in disciplinary  ¦\ní\nsegregation.  ¡\nAn inmate previously removed from work assignment for  ¡\nplacement in ILP will be given an opportunity to be reinstated in ``\ni\nsuch work positions or a job with comparable pay, as well as an  ¦\nopportunity to complete ILP requirements at a time that does not\n|j interfere with the work assignment subject to the above listed  ¦\n!'

Compliance with the Plan and this Stipulation will be  ¦\n, i  -\nachieved without any substantial deprivation of existing rights\n¦i  ¦\n¡¦ to which members of the Plaintiff class are entitled under the  ;\ni¦  !\n| Modified Decree at the PNM complex.  |\n¡|  j\n;!  9.  Neither this Stipulation nor the Inmate Activity Plan  \\\n\\`¦ filed April 22, 1994, are to be construed as modifications of the ¡\n\\¦ Modified Decree.\n11  10.

The\nCourt has considered the said Joint Request and the terms\nof the proposed settlement and has determined that the pro-\nposed Partial Consent Decree would be in the interest of\njustice to the parties and should be entered.\nWherefore, premises considered, the defendants, individually\nand in their official capacities, their agents, employees,\nsuccessors in office and any others acting in concert with\nthem, are hereby .enjoined from failing to implement fully and\nwithin the times prescribed each of the following requirements:\n1.  Policy Statement PNM-77-IM-60001.1, 07-27-77, Subject:\nCorrespondence Regulations, will be replaced by the Policy\nStatement attached to this order as Exhibit A.  The new\npolicy statement will be provided to all prisoners and will\nbe operational as soon as is practical after this order is\nentered but in no event later than 21 days after the entry of\nsaid order.\n2.  There will be no requirement that prisoners sign a\nwaiver of their right to object ot the opening of their mail or\nto take legal action to assure continuing adherence to concti-,\ntutional standards in correspondence policies and practices.\n\n3.

The described records and documents will be\nmade available to counsel for the plaintiffs for examination\nand copying at any tine upon reasonable notice.  In the event\ncounsel for the plaintiffs subsequently determine that the\npolicy statement is being executed in such a manner as to\napparently violate constitutional rights of prisoners, they may\nby appropriate notion with the Court raise the issues presented\nfor a determination by the Court as to what relief, if any,\nshould be granted.\n4.

Apo1daca\nDefendants.\nPC-NM-001-012\nORDER\nThe parties to the above-captioned civil action have entered into a\nStipulation concerning the closing of dormitory housing units at the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico.  In the Stipulation, the parties acknowledge\nthat correctional officers presently are deployed in the dormitory housing\nunits in a manner that does not provide to inmates a reasonable degree of\nsafety.  The parties further acknowledge that it is not possible to deploy\nofficers in a manner that will provide such safety consistent with sound\ncorrectional policy.  The parties therefore have stipulated that the\nutilization of the dormitory housing units at the Penitentiary of New\nMexico creates an unjustifiable risk of harm to inmates and therefore is\ncontrary to sound correctional  policy and violates the Court's orders in\nthis action.\nThe parties have agreed that present circumstances require the continued\nshort-term use of the dormitories to house inmates.  The completion of\n\nconstruction of new facilities and the opening of those facilities for\noccupancy, however, will eliminate the need for the dormitory housing\n'lunits.  Upon the opening of the Penitentiary of New Mexico—North  facility,\nthe parties have agreed the inmates housed at that time in the dormitory  .\nhousing units will be reassigned to other general population housing units\nand the dormitories at the Penitentiary of New Mexico will be closed\npermanently.\nThe Court has reviewed the Stipulation of the parties and finds it\nconsistent with the orders entered in this action and necessary to achieve\ncompliance with those orders.\nWherefore, premises considered, it is\nORDERED that the Stipulation Concerning Closing of Dormitories at the\nPenitentiary of New Mexico, entered into by the parties to this action,\nis APPROVED.  It is further\nORDERED that defendaats implement forthwith the provisions of the\nStipulation.\nSIGNED and ENTERED this3&  day of April, 1984.\n/JUAN G.

BURCIAGA\nvs.  )\nTONEY ANAYA, et al.,  )\nDefendants.  )\n)\nSTIPULATION CONCERNING CLOSING OF\nDORMITORIES AT THE PENITENTIARY OF NEW MEXICO\nThe parties to the above-captioned civil action met on March\n5 and 6, 1984 to discuss issues raised by the first and second\nreports of the Special Master on the defendants' state of compli-\nance  with  the  Court's  orders  in  this  litigation.  Among  the\nmatters  discussed  in  these meetings were  the  findings  of the\nSpecial Master set forth in his second report on compliance with\nthe Court's orders relating to staffing.  As a result of those\nmeetings, and subsequent developments, the parties have reached\nagreement on certain issues relating to the secure operation of\nthe Penitentiary of New Mexico in compliance with the orders of\nthe Court, and they hereby enter into the following stipulation.\n1.  The Special Master found, in his Second Report on the\nDefendants'  State  of Compliance  (Staffing),  that  \"although  at\nleast one correctional officer is scheduled to be stationed in\nthe sally port adjoining each dormitory at the Penitentiary of\nNew Mexico at all times, these officers are not deployed in such\na  manner  as  to  assure  visual  observation  of  inmates  at  all\n\ntimes.\"  Neither  party  to  this  litigation  objected  to  that\nfinding and it has been confirmed by the Court.\n2.  It is not possible to deploy  correctional officers  in\nthe  dormitory  housing  units  at  PNM  in  a  manner  that  assures\nvisual observation of inmates at all times.  Any such deployment\nis contrary to sound correctional practice.\n3.  In  the  absence  of  continuous  visual  observation  of\ninmates assigned to dormitory housing units at PNM, those dormi-\ntories  cannot be operated  in a manner  that provides  to  inmates\nassigned  to them a reasonable degree of  safety.  Utilization of\nthe dormitory housing units at PNM for housing inmates under such\ncircumstances  creates  an  unjustifiable  risk  of harm  to  inmates\nand  therefore  is  contrary  to  sound  correctional  policy  and\nviolates the Court's order in this cause.\n4.  The  present  inmate  population  in New  Mexico  and  the\ncapacity of available medium and maximum security facilities for\nadult  inmates  requires  the  continued  short-term  use . of  the\ndormitories  at  PNM  to  house  inmates.  This  necessity  will  be\neliminated  by  the  completion  of  construction  of  additional\ncorrectional facilities at Santa Fe.\n5.  Upon the opening of the Penitentiary of New Mexico  —\nNorth  Facility,  all  inmates  housed  at  that  time  in  dormitory\nhousing  units  at  PNM  will  be  reassigned  to  general  population\nhousing.  The reassignment and relocation of inmates from dormi-\ntories at PNM will be accomplished as quickly as possible and in\n\nno event shall it take more than thirty working days after the North\nfacility is open for occupancy.\n6.  After all inmates have been reassigned from dormitory housing\nunits at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, those dormitories shall be closed\npermanently and at no time in the future shall they be used to house inmates.\n7.  The parties enter into this stipulation in full awareness of existing\nprojections of increases in the New Mexico inmate population in the future\nand of the fact that these projections may be exceeded.\nSigned:\nMichael  Francke JonVBigelow\nSecretary\nCounsel for Defendants\nWilliam W.

Anaya\nDear Mr. Deaton:\nThis is to notify you, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the\nagreement of the Consent Decree, that effective July 7, 1985,\nDefendants intend to treat possession of a contraband\ninstrument capable of causing death or serious bodily harm as\ngrounds for involuntary placement in maximum security status.\nFor purposes of this procedure, Defendants intend to change and\nnow propose changes in the Maximum Security policy statement of\nthe Consent Decrees.\nThe first change would be in.paragraph 3(a)(i) and the\nnew proposed language of that section would be:\n(i)  The disciplinary committee has recently\nfound that the inmate has committed an act of\nviolence, substantial destruction of state\nproperty, escape or attempted escape, rioting\nor inciting a riot, taking hostages, or\npossession, introduction or manufacture of a\ncontraband instrument capable of causing death\nor serious bodily harm, and as a result of such\nfinding has been sentenced to disciplinary\nsegregation; and\nDefendants also propose to amend paragraph 9 of the\nmaximum security policy statement, by adding a new section (f),\nas follows:\n(f)  Possession, introduction or manufacture of\na contraband instrument capable of causing\ndeath or serious bodily harm.\nThe reasons for the proposed changes include:\nEXHIBIT \"A\" TO DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO MDDIFY THE MAXIMUM\nSECURITY POLICY STATEMENT OF THE CONSENT DECREE - Pase 1 of 2\n\nWilliam W.

Increasing the physical safety of persons who work\nwith the inmate population.\nAs you are aware, weapons have been a constant and\nlong-standing problem throughout the institution.  By increas-\ning the potential sanctions for contraband instruments capable\nof causing death or serious bodily harm, Defendants anticipate\nthat the possession and use of weapons in the institutions will\ndramatically decrease.  This decrease will result in increased\nbenefits to the vast and overwhelming majority of persons in\nthe Plaintiff class.  The only persons who could be conceivably\ndisadvantaced would be those persons who were illegally posses-\nsing or using contraband weapons of any kind in the institu-\ntions .\nDefendants are following the procedures set forth in\nparagraph 6 of the agreement, to insure that Plaintiffs are\ngiven every possible opportunity to object to the proposed\nchanges as contemplated by the paragraph 6 procedure.  Defen-\ndants are following this procedure notwithstanding the fact\nthat Plaintiffs have been on notice as to the intentions of\nDefendants in attempting to increase potential sanctions for\ncontraband instruments over the past several months.  Because\nof the Plaintiffs' lack of willingness to consider  increased\nsanctions, Defendants will assume that unless they hear to the\ncontrary from Plaintiffs, informal efforts to resolve this\nmatter would be futile.  However, should Plaintiffs decide at\nany time that informal efforts to resolve the matter would be\nhelpful, Defendants would consult with them.\nSincerely,\nSCHEUER & ENGET), P.C.\nJohn-;B•   ig,  e low •/\nSpecial Assistant\nAttorney General\nJB:blm\ncc:  Michael Francke\nKay Monaco\nCarol Leach de Montoya\nGeorge Sullivan\nVincent Nathan",

Civil  Mo.  77-0721-JB\nTONEY  ANAYA,  et  a l. ,  ENTSrFr r-  rc^$J\nDefendants.  .  —\nO R D ER\nOn September 2, 1986, plaintiffs filed their Amended Motion\nfor an Order to Show Cause and for Further Relief.  The plain-\ntiffs' Motion seeks an order of this Court requiring defendants\nto show cause why they  should not be found in contempt of the\norders in this  cause and why further  relief in favor of the\nplaintiff  class  should  not be granted.  The plaintiffs  also\nrequest an order establishing a discovery schedule.  Defendants\nfiled their response to the plaintiffs' Motion.on September 12.\nAlso  pending  before  the Court are motions  filed by both\nparties  seeking to modify the Court's orders.  The plaintiffs'\nMotion  for Modification  seeks  additional  relief  designed to\nprotect the rights of their  clients or to extend .remedies for\n1  The plaintiffs' original pleading in this fashion, styled a\nMotion for Contempt, was filed on December 2, 1985.  The Court\nsubsequently ordered that an amended Motion be filed following a\nlengthy  fact-finding  process  conducted by the Special  Master.\nOrder of January 10, 1986.\n2  The plaintiffs have also filed a Motion seeking the initia-\ntion of criminal contempt proceedings against a named individual.\nThis Motion is treated in a separate order.\n\npast deprivations.  Defendants' Motion prays, in the alternative,\nfor various  forms  of relief, including  vacation  or  modification\nof the Court's orders, limitation of the definition of the plain-\ntiff  class,  or  dissolution  or  reduction  in  scope  of  the\nmastership.  For the sake of convenience, this pleading hereafter\nwill  be  referred  to  as  defendants'  Motion  for  Modification.\nNotwithstanding  the  various  titles  defendants  assign  to  their\npleas for relief, they appear to evolve from a central conception\nexpressed  in  their  Motion  and  in  subsequent  pleadings  that,  to\nthe extent the Court's equitable orders afford relief beyond- what\nthe Constitution  mandates, they  are  invalid.  Without  prejudice\nto  defendant's  motion,  this  particular  contention  warrants\ncomment to ensure  the parties understand  the applicable  standard\nfor modification and thus are aware of the legal standards  under\nwhich the Court's conclusions will be made.\nFirst,  it  is  settled  beyond  question  that  a  court's\nequitable  powers  are  broad  and  a  court  has  considerable\nflexibility  in  tailoring  injunctive  relief  to  remedy\nconstitutional  deficiencies.  Such  relief  can  be  broader  than\ndirectly  compelled  by  the  Constitution  if  the  court  concludes\nthat such measures are necessary to redress the wrong.  Swann v_^\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  Board  of Education, 402 U.S. 1,  15  (1971)\n(\"Once a right  and  a violation  have been  shown, the  scope  of a\ndistrict court's equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad,\nfor breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\")\nThus,  the  legal  proposition  advanced  by  the  defendants  to  the\n\neffect  that  this Court may not enter an injunction  that compels\nmore than the Constitution is simply in error.\nSecond, the principle advanced by defendants is particularly\ninapplicable where the Court's remedial orders have been entered\nby consent.  In 1938, the United  States Supreme Court set forth\nthe  stringent  standard  for  modification  of  consent  decrees,\nmaking  clear  that  the  party  seeking  modification  bears  a\nparticularly  heavy burden.  In United  States y. Swift, 286 U.S.\n106  (1938),  the Supreme Court announced  the standards  applicable\nto  motions  for  modification  of  consent  decrees  and  those\nstandards have remained the governing law in the area.  The Court\ndistinguished  between  \"restraints  that give protection to rights\nfully  accrued  upon  facts  so  nearly  permanent  as  to  be\nsubstantially  impervious  to  change,  and  those  that  involve  the\nsupervision  of  changing  conduct  or  conditions  and  are  thus\nprovisional or tentative.\"  286 U.S. at 114-15.\nAs  several  courts  have  observed,  this  distinction  is\nparticularly  important  in  cases  involving  institutional  reform,\nwhere  conduct  and  conditions  change  over  time.  See, e.g.,  New\nYork  Association  for  Retarded  Children,  Inc.  v.  Carey\n(Willowbrook),  706  F.2d  956,  969  (2d  Cir.  1983);  Newman  v^\nGraddick,  740  F.2d  1513, 1520  (11th Cir. 1S84).  To  the  extent\ndefendants assert that these cases alter and diminish the Kolding\nin  Swift,  however,  that  assertion  has  been  confuted  by  the\nSupreme  Court's  recent  holding  in  Local  93,  International\nAssociation  of Firefighters  Vj_ City  o_f Cleveland, 478 U.S.  ,\n92 L.Ed.2d  405  (1986).\n\nBefore discussing the pending pleadings and establishing the\nprocedure  by  which  they  will  be\" adjudicated,  the  procedural\nhistory of the pending matters should be outlined.  In its August\n9, 1985 order, the Court expressed its intention that all issues\nrelating to violation of the Court's injunction and the parties'\ndesires to modify that injunction would be considered together,\nrather  than  in  piecemeal  fashion.  Accordingly,  the  Court\ndirected the parties to attempt to resolve those issues through\nconcerted negotiations convened and guided by the Special Master;\nthat failing  such resolution, the parties were directed by the\nCourt  to  present  all  outstanding  issues  for  the  Court's\nconsideration and resolution in comprehensive pleadings.\nThe process  of presenting  the issues  for resolution began\nwith the filing on December 2, 1985 of the plaintiffs' Motion for\nContempt and Motion for Modification, and the defendants' Motion\nfor Modification.  On January  10, 1386, the Court directed the\nSpecial Master to prepare comprehensive findings of fact relating\nto  the  defendants'  state  of  compliance  with  the  outstanding\nremedial orders.  On February 18, that directive was narrowed to\nrequire  reporting  on only  those portions  of  the  Court's  order\nimplicated in a document entitled Compendium of Violations which\nwas appended by  the plaintiffs  to their  December  2 Motion  for\nContempt.\nUpon  completion  of  the  Special  Master's  fact-finding\nprocess, the proposed findings were distributed to the parties in\ndraft form.  In its order of June 5, 1986, the Court established\nthe  process  for  review  of  and  objection  to  those  findings.\n\n\"\\\nSpecifically, the Court decreed that the failure of either party\nto object to a finding of  fact proposed  by  the Special Master\nwould  constitute  an admission by that party to the accuracy of\nthe finding, and  the party would be foreclosed  from contesting\nits  accuracy  in  subsequent proceedings.  On  September  19, the\nSpecial  Master  filed  his  findings  of  fact  with  the  Court,\ncontaining approximately 650 findings to which both parties have\nagreed.\nThe  plaintiffs' Motion  for an Order  to Show Cause relies\nheavily  on  the  Special  Master's  findings  of  fact  and  on  the\ntwenty reports he has filed with the Court.  It is 74 pages long\nand contains 13 sections, each of which has numerous sub-sections\ncontaining  individual  allegations of contumacious conduct.  The\nsections of the plaintiffs' Motion are the following:  Staffing\n(10  subsections),  Training  (11  subsections),  Medical  Care  (31\nsubsections),  Mental  Health  Care  (32  subsections),  Inmate\nActivity  (15 subsections), Food Service  (7 subsections)', Failure\nto File Plans, Classification (25 subsections), Inmate Discipline\n(92  subsections),  Living  Conditions  (IS  subsections),  Maximum\nSecurity  (19  subsections),  Equitable  Treatment  of  Women  (15\nsubsections) and Unilateral Modifications (26 subsections).\nRather than respond to each of the 302 separate allegations\nof contempt set forth in the plaintiffs' motion, the defendants'\nresponse to the Motion raises a series of issues relating to the\nadjudication  of  the pending  matters.  The defendants' response\naddresses  several  general  issues  before  asserting  affirmative\ndefenses to the allegations of contempt.  First, the defendants\n\nassert that their motion for modification should have precedence\nover the motion for contempt because findings of contempt should\nbe limited to those conditions existing in the New Mexico prisons\nwhich  are  constitutionally  deficient,  without  regard  to  the\nparticular  standards  set  forth  in  the  orders.3  Second,  and\nalternatively, defendants contend that among the omnibus defenses\nto  plaintiffs'  contempt  motion  is  that  of  \"substantial\ncompliance\" with  the Court's  directives; that  viewed  in their\nentirety,  if  the  conditions  in  the  New  Mexico  prisons  are\nsubstantially in conformity with the Court's orders, the issue of\nparticularized  contempts, as alleged  in the plaintiffs' motion,\nshould not be reached.4\nThird, using the doctrine of civil contempt as a departure\npoint,  the  defendants  argue  that  the  Court's  inquiry  into\n3  This contention is difficult to fathom, since the concept of\ncontempt  relates  to violation  of extant  Court  orders, not  the\nlegally separate issue of constitutionality of conditions.  This\nconfusion appears to be the result of erroneous blending of two\nrelated but separate assertions:  first, that the defendants are\nentitled  to  modification  of  the  Court's  orders  so  that  they\nembody nothing more than constitutional imperatives, and second,\nthat if the orders are so modified, the defendants cannot be held\nin  contempt  for  violating  orders  that  subsequently  have  been\nmodified.  The former contention has been dealt with above; the\nlatter  simply  is a misstatement of applicable law.  See, e.g.,\nGompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418 (1911).\n4  This statement of position is overbroad.  If, for example,\nthe defendants have complied with numerous substantive' provisions\nof  the  Court's  orders,  but  are  found  to  be  in  significant\nnoncompliance with the provisions relating to medical care, they\nscarcely  can  claim  immunity  from  contempt.  If, on  the ether\nhand, in the area of medical care defendants are proven to be in\nsubstantial  compliance  with  the various mandates  in the order,\nand their failings in that regard are minor and  inconsequential\nin that they do not abridge  fundamental rights or threaten the\nhealth  and  safety of the plaintiffs, then that situation would\nmitigate strongly against a finding of contempt.\n\ncompliance  should  focus  on the  state  of  affairs  at the  time of\nthe hearing.  Only if that inquiry reflects a lack of substantial\ncompliance  can  the  Court  impose  civil  contempt  sanctions.^\nFinally,  defendants  request  that  any  contempt  proceeding  be\ncarefully  regulated  to ensure that all potential contemnors have\nbeen  afforded  adequate  notice  and  opportunity  for  defense.  in\nsupport  of  this  'request,  defendants  observe  that  plaintiffs'\nAmended  Motion  names  four  respondents:  Governor  Toney  Anaya,\nSecretary  of  Corrections  Michael  Francke, Deputy  Secretary  Alan\nShuman and George Sullivan, the Warden of the Penitentiary of New\nMexico.  The  defendants  observe  that  a  large  number  of  the\nindividual allegations in the Amended Motion fail to identify the\nperson or persons responsible  for the claimed violation and that\nanalysis  of  those .allegations  suggests  that  none  of  the  four\nnamed respondents is the person most probably responsible for the\nalleged condition.6\nThis  discussion  of  the  Amended  Motion  and  the defendants'\nResponse should make it clear that the matters pending before the\nCourt are complex and vast in scope.  Past the threshold issue of\nwhether  an Order  to  Show  Cause  should  issue,  the  scope  of  the\nplaintiffs'  Amended  Motion  and  its  temporal  breadth,  -the\n5  As  an  ancillary  point,  the  defendants  argue  that  the\npotential civil contempt remedy of compensatory damage awards to\nindividual  class  members  necessarily  entails  such  an  elaborate\nand protracted proceeding as to be unworthy of consideration.\n6  Defendants'  response  also  requests  that  the  plaintiffs'\nrequest to take the deposition of Governor Toney Anaya be denied.\nAs discussed in Section IV.A of this order, discovery issues will\nbe addressed by the Court on proper motion.\n\nintricacy of defendants' legal contentions in their Response ~and\nthe  complexity  of  the  factual  record  relevant  to  the  pending\nmotions  for  contempt  and  modification  present  a range of issues\nthat demand clarification.\nBeyond their specific points, the pending pleadings have led\nthe Court to reflect  on essential  issues of  judicial  management\nsuch  as  the  order  and  nature  of  proof  and  the  evidentiary\npresumptions  raised  by  the  fact  finding  process  the  Court\nestablished  in  its  January  10  order.  The  instant  order  is\ndesigned to address these issues with care and to provide clarity\nto  the  parties  as  to  the  proceedings  to  be  conducted  in  the\nadjudication of all matters currently pending in this cause.\nI.  Show Cause Order\nThe Court has reviewed the plaintiffs' Amended Motion for an\nOrder to Show Cause with great care.  As part of this review, the\nCourt has revisited a number of the reports of the Special Master\nthat have been filed and has reviewed  the Findings of Fact filed\non  September  19.  This  assessment  convinces  the Court  that  the\nplaintiffs' allegations of contumacious  conduct are supported  by\nsufficient  evidence  to warrant  the issuance of an Order to Show\nCause directing  that Anaya, Francke, Shuman  and  Sullivan  appear\nbefore this Court and show cause whey they should not be held in\ncontempt of its orders.  The plaintiffs' Amended  Motion  contains\nnumerous  specific  allegations  of noncompliance  with  the  Court's\norders,  and  the  named  respondents  must  be  prepared  to  defend\nthemselves  against  these  charges/  assuming  that  the  plaintiffs\nadduce competent evidence probative of the charges.  The Court is\n\nsympathetic to the defendants' plea that the allegations in the\nAmended Motion are vast and cover an enormous range of acts and\nomissions  by  persons  at  all  levels  of  responsibility  in  the\nCorrections Department.  Nonetheless, the Court is satisfied that\nthe  plaintiffs  have  attempted  in  good  faith  to  specify  the\nfactual  bases  for  their  Motion  and  to provide  to  the alleged\ncontemnors  notice of the conduct alleged  to be in violation of\nthe Court's orders.\nAs discussed  below, the nature of civil contempt requires\nthe  Court  to  assess  the  state  of  affairs  at  the  time  of  the\nproceeding  in  order  to  assess  the  duration  and  magnitude  of\nalleged  violations  and  determine  the  nature  of  the  relief\nrequired to ensure future compliance.  Thus, the plaintiffs will\nbe  given  the  opportunity  to  present  evidence  of  conduct  or\nomissions  arising  after  the  date  of  the Amended  Motion.  The\nplaintiffs must limit that proof, however, to the subject matters\naddressed  in  their  Amended  Motion.  Attempts  to  prove\nnoncompliance with provisions of the Court's order that are not\nimplicated  in the Amended Motion or in a related pleading filed\nin advance of- the proceeding will not be countenanced  absent a\nshowing of excusable neglect.\nShould  the plaintiffs  seek  contempt  sanctions  against any\nindividuals other than those named in their Amended Motion, they\nmust  identify  those  persons  at the  earliest possible  time and\nprovide to them notice of the conduct alleged to be contumacious.\nThe Court will ensure that any such additional respondents will\nhave adequate time to prepare a defense against the charges.  Any\n\nfailure  on  the  part  of  the  plaintiffs  in  this  regard  will\nforeclose  them  from  pursuing  conteir.pt  sanctions  against  any\npersons other than the four identified above.\nII#  Nature of Proceeding\nThe pleadings pending before the Court raise two issues that\nare inextricably related, although in legal analysis they must be\nseparated:  the state of defendants' compliance with the Court's\norders  and  the  question  of  whether  those  orders  should  be\nmodified.  The  parties  have  briefed  these  issues  with  close\nattention to the relationship of one to the other.  Specifically,\nthe parties have argued different positions on the order in which\nthe  Court  should  analyze  the  proof  offered  at  trial  as  to\ncompliance and  the merits of modification.  That question is one\nof acute concern- to the Court.  At an appropriate time, the Court\nwill  direct  the  parties  to  condense  their  arguments  in  briefs\ndirected solely at that critical issue.  At present, however, the\nlegal  question  need  not  be  addressed.  The  Court  currently  is\nconcerned with the limited issue of the nature of the proceedings\nit will conduct in order to receive evidence from the parties in\nsupport of their motions.\nAs to this issue, it is clear that the interest of judicial\neconomy  will be  served  if  all  evidence  relevant  to  the  pending\nmotions  is  heard  in  one  proceeding.  Irrespective  of  whether\nmodification  or  contempt  has  priority  in  the  Court's\ndeliberations,  the  substantial  overlap  in  evidence  relevant  to\nsupport of  either  Motion  suggests  that one proceeding,  offering\n\nthe  parties  plenary  opportunity  to  make  their  cases,  will\nsuffice.\nBy way of example, the plaintiffs' Amended Motion presumably\nwill be  supported by evidence  of  significant  noncompliance; to\nrefute  the plaintiffs' case, the defendants may offer rebuttal\nevidence as well as evidence supporting affirmative defenses of\nsubstantial  compliance, reasonable  diligence, impossibility and\nrelated issues.  At the same time, precisely that same evidence\nis, by the defendants' own argument, supporting of their Motion\nfor  Modification.  Finally,  in  rebutting  the  defendants'\nevidence, the plaintiffs might present evidence of ill intention,\npoor  administration  and  similar  considerations.  The  limited\nbriefing  of  the  parties  on  the  issues  of  contempt  and\nmodification  makes  clear  that  this  broad  body  of  evidence  is\nrelevant  to  all  issues  before  the  Court  and must  be  received\nbefore  the  Court  adjudicates  any  of  those  issues.  Thus,  the\nhearing the Court convenes for purposes of the Show Cause Order\nissues  herein  will  also  serve  as  a hearing  on  the  issues  of\nmodification raised in the parties' pleadings.\nIII.  Order of Proof\nSince  the  hearing  on  the  pending  pleadings  will  be  an\nomnibus  proceeding,  the  order  of  proof  must  be  addressed.\nDiscussion of that question requires consideration of evidentiary\nissues  including  the  temporal  limits  on  evidence  relevant  to\ncontempt,  evidence  supporting  various  forms  of  relief  for\ncontempt, should it be established, and the presumptions arising\nfrom the Special Master's reports and findings of fact.\n\nA.  The Plaintiffs' Case in Chief  -\nAt the outset of the hearing, the plaintiffs  will have  the\nburden  of  going  forward  with  evidence  supporting  their  Amended\nMotion.  Although  the  Motion  sought  issuance  of  a  show  cause\norder, ultimately  the plaintiffs  case  rests  on their ability  to\nestablish  a  failure  of  defendants  to  comply  with  the  Court's\nremedial  orders.  Accordingly,  the hearing  will begin with  that\nevidence.\nThe  Special  Master  has  filed  twenty  reports  containing\nfindings  of  fact  concerning  compliance.  Each  of  those  reports\nhas  been  confirmed  and  the  findings  contained  in  them  are\nfindings of the Court, and  are appropriate  subjects  of  judicial\nnotice  under  Rule  201(b)(2).  Should  either  party  seek  the\nintroduction -into evidence  of  findings  contained  in the -Special\nMaster's  reports,  the  Court  will  take  judicial  notice  of  those\nfindings  upon  appropriate  motion  citing  the  facts  sought  to be\nadduced.\nIn  addition  to  the  twenty  compliance  reports,  the  Special\nMaster  has  prepared  a  volume  entitled  \"Findings  of  Fact\" which\ncontains  approximately  650  findings  to which  neither  party  has\nobjected.  Under the terms of the Court's orders, the failure to\nobject  constitutes  an  admission  of  the accuracy of the  finding.\nThus, the parties are foreclosed  from challenging the accuracy of\nthe  findings, a result the Court announced  clearly in its June 5\norder.  The findings of fact have not been confirmed by the Court\nand  so  are  not  findings  of  the  Court  of which  judicial  notice\nshould  be  taken.  The  findings  plainly  are  admissible  upon\n\nappropriate motion, however, and neither party will be heard to\nobject  to  their  accuracy.  Other  objections  (e.g.,  relevancy)\nwill be evaluated as necessary.\nThese  findings, of course, are not conclusive  evidence of\nthe  state  of  affairs  at  the  time  of  the  hearing.  The\nintroduction  to  the  Special  Master's  findings  indicates  they\nreflect the situation at institutions between February and April\nof this year.  Thus, by the time of the hearing, they will be\nsomewhat dated.  This time lag of course was contemplated by the\nCourt when it initiated the fact-finding process, and it did not\nintend to require the doing of a vain act.  The Special Master's\nfindings, limited as they were to\"allegations in the plaintiffs'\nCompendium of Violations, were designed to establish a bench mark\nfor  the  parties  and  the  Court  as  to  the  areas  of  the  order\nimplicated in plaintiffs' Motion and the state of compliance in\nthose  areas.  As  such, and  in view  of the concessions  of the\nparties as to  the  accuracy  of the  findings, it is appropriate\nthat  the Court  establish  a rebuttable presumption  arising  from\nthose findings.  Specifically,  the Court will presume  that the\nstate of affairs described, in the Findings of Fact filed by the\nSpecial Master has continued to the date of the hearing.  A party\nalleging  a  change  of  conditions  since  the  Special  Master's\nfindings will have the burden of presenting  evidence sufficient\nto rebut the presumption.\nBy suggesting  that the state of affairs at the time of the\nhearing is a point of central concern, the Court does not intend\nto imply that evidence of past noncompliance is not relevant.  To\n\nthe contrary, such evidence is highly relevant to certain issues\nbefore the Court.  In this regard, a limited  discussion of the\nlaw of contempt with concentration on its temporal limits and the\nappropriate remedies is warranted.  First, proof of noncompliance\nat trial may relate to present noncompliance, past noncompliance\nor  both.  Were  the  evidence  at  trial  to  demonstrate  current\nnoncompliance,  evidence  that  this  noncompliance  is  of\nlongstanding  duration  would  be  relevant  to  issues  of  notice,\nreasonable  diligence,  and  the  need  for  supplemental  relief.\nAdditionally,  the Court would  assess the proper  form of relief\nfor civil contempt, including the need for sanctions designed to\ncoerce compliance in the future and the propriety of compensatory\nrelief for class members, in light of the scope and duration of\nnoncompliance.\nSecond,  although  the  assertion  that  civil  contempt  is\nconcerned only with current compliance has facial appeal, it is\ntoo  simplistic  in  the  context  of  this  action  it  is  too\nsimplistic.  The  plaintiffs'  Motion  for  Contempt  was  filed\napproximately  ten months ago.  The intervening period has been\nconsumed by inteasive fact-finding efforts by the Special Master\nwhich, although lengthy, have been more expeditious that formal\ndiscovery would have been by the parties pursuant to the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.  The protracted process is the direct\nproduct of the scope of the Court's remedial orders.  The mere\nfact  that  the orders  in this case are  extensive  and therefore\nrequire  lengthy  fact-finding  to determine  compliance  cannot be\npermitted to impair the plaintiffs' abilities to allege and prove\n\ncivil contempt, nor can it defeat the Court's legitimate interest\nin compelling  compliance with  its orders.  Even if the  state of\naffairs at the tie of the hearing reveals the defendants to be in\ncompliance  with  the  Court's  orders,  evidence  of  past\nnoncompliance  eight  convince  the Court  of  the need  for  imposing\nsanctions  specifically  to  discourage  future  noncompliance  or\nannouncing  contingent  sanctions  to  be  imposed  in  the  event  of\nfuture noncompliance.  Similarly, evidence of past noncompliance,\neven if cured at the time of hearing, would still be relevant to\nthe issue of compensatory relief for class members.\nAccordingly,  evidence  of  past  noncompliance  at  any  time\nsince entry of the Court's remedial orders will be admissible  if\nit is relevant to the issues of a) duration of noncompliance, b)\nknowledge by defendants, c) the need  for coercive  sanctions, d)\ni\nindividual responsibility, e) the appropriateness of compensatory\ndamage  awards  to  the  class  as  a  whole  or  to  individual  class\nmembers,  or  f)  refutation  of  affirmative  defenses  offered  by\ndefendants.  No  such  evidence  will  be  admitted,  however,  if  it\nfalls within any one of the three following categories:\na)  the evidence  relates  to  events  prior  to  December  1985\nwhen the plaintiffs  filed their Conpendium of Violations and the\nissue is not raised in that document; or\nb)  the evidence relates to events between December 1985 and\nSeptember  1986 when the plaintiffs filed their Amended Motion and\nthe issue is not raised in that pleading; or\n\nc)  the evidence relates to events since September 1986 and\nthe  plaintiffs  have  not  provided  notice  of  the  issue  to  the\ndefendants in a formal pleading.\nFinally,  with  respect  to  the  plaintiffs'  case  in chief,\nevidence  of  individual  instances  of  noncompliance  will  be\nadmitted, but not for the purpose of establishing an individual\nclass member's entitlement to compensatory damages.  Should the\nCourt conclude at the end. of the hearing that contempt has been\nestablished  and  that  individual  compensatory  damages  are  an\nappropriate form of relief, it will issue an order establishing a\nprocedure by which evidence necessary to make those calculations\nwill be adduced.\nB.  Defendants' Case\nAfter the plaintiffs have concluded their case in chief, the\ndefendants will have  the opportunity  to present  their evidence\nrelating  to  the  state  of  compliance  within  the  time  periods\nencompassed  by  plaintiffs' proof.  Evidence  supporting  legally\ncognizable  affirmative  defenses  raised  in  their  pleadings  and\nevidence  relating  solely  to  the  defendants'  Motion  for\nModification  will  not  be  considered  during  this  phase  of  the\nproceeding.\nC.  Plaintiffs' Rebuttal\nThe  plaintiffs  will  have  the  opportunity  to  rebut  any\nevidence offered by the defendants relating to compliance.\nD.  Defendants' Case in Chief\nThe defendants will have the burden of going  forward with\nevidence  supporting  legally  cognizable  affirmative  defenses\n\nraised  in  their  pleadings,  and  with  evidence  not  previously\nadduced that is relevant to their Motion for Modification.  \"\nE.  Plaintiffs' Response and Case for Modification\nThe  plaintiffs  will  present  evidence  relating  to  the\ndefendants' affirmative defenses and their case for modification,\nand evidence supporting their own Motion for Modification.\nF.  Defendants' Rebuttal\nThe  defendants  will  present  rebuttal  evidence  on  their\naffirmative  defenses  and  their  Motion  for  Modification,  and\nevidence relating to plaintiffs' case for modification.\nG.  Plaintiffs' Rebuttal\nThe  plaintiffs  will  present  rebuttal  evidence  supporting\ntheir Motion for Modification.\nIV.  PARTIAL REFERENCE TO THE SPECIAL MASTER\nAs demonstrated by the foregoing discussion of the pleadings\npending  before  the  Court  and  the  evidentiary  issues  raised by\nthem, the factual record that must be developed to permit plenary\nconsideration  and  adjudication  of  the  pending  matters  is\nextensive  and  complex.  It  is  also  apparent  that  the  vast\nmajority  of  relevant  facts have been  developed  by  the Special\nMaster  through  the formal reporting  process  established  by  the\nOrder  of  Reference  entered  June  3, 1983  and  through the fact-\nfinding process set up in the Court's orders of January  10 and\nFebruary  18, 1986.  The Court's careful review of the findings\nsubmitted by the Special Master throughout his tenure makes clear\nthat  the  objective  of  the  original  Order  of  Reference\nthorough,  accurate  and  efficient  fact-finding  —  has  been\n17\n\naccomplished  and  that the Mastership has been of service  to the\nCourt  and  the  parties  in  avoiding  protracted,  complicated  and\nexpensive  hearings  on  recurring  issues.  Particularly,  the most\nrecent efforts of the Special Master  in developing  approximately\n650 findings of fact that can be introduced into evidence without\nobjection have been instrumental  in paring down the scope of the\nevidentiary  hearing  that  will  be  conducted  in  this  case  —  a\nresult\" that  benefits  the  Court  and  the  parties  by  preserving\nlitigation  and  judicial  resources  for  matters  truly  in\ncontroversy.\nThe  value  of  the  Special Master  in making  findings of  fact\nas to compliance suggests that he may serve further to assist the\nCourt  and  the  parties  in  completing  the  factual  record  on  this\nlimited  subject  as  required  by  the  pending  pleadings.  As\ndiscussed  above,  the  record  the  Special  Master  has  developed\ncontains extensive findings as to the state of compliance between\nSeptember  1983  and  April  1986,  the  period  encompassed  by  the\ntwenty  compliance  reports  and  the  finding  of  fact  filed  on\nSeptember  19,  1986.  Section  III.A  of  this  order  provides\ndirection  as  to  the  extent  and  nature  of  relevance  of  these\nfindings.  Missing from the current record, however, are findings\nas  to  the  current  state  of  compliance,  a  portrait  that  is\nessential  to  the  Court's  consideration  of  the  motions  for\ncontempt and modification.\nThe  Court has  announced  above  its view of the presumptions\nthat  arise  from  the  Special  Master's  findings  of  fact.  The\nparties thus have given direction as to the state of affairs that\n\nis  defined  by  the  existing  record  and  so  can  assess  what\nadditional facts must be developed and proved at trial in order\nto  carry  the  applicable  burdens  of  proof.  In  view  of  the\nparticular  familiarity  of  the  Special  Master  with  the  factual\nrecord  compiled  to  date  and  the  nature  and  quality  of  proof\nrelevant to particular factual issues, he is well positioned to\nserve  as  a  Hearing  Officer  for  purposes  of  taking  evidence\nrelating to the state of compliance on issues not addressed, for\nwhatever  reason, by  extant  findings.  The evidence  adduced  at\nthis  hearing  will  complete  the  factual  record  relating  to\ncompliance  and  will  permit  the  Special  Master  to  prepare\ncomprehensive  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  on  the\nissue of compliance with the Court's remedial orders. .\nThe appointment of the Special Master to-serve as a Hearing\nOfficer  is consistent with  the June  3, 19S3 Order of Reference\nagreed  to by the parties  and  is in accordance  with  the tenets\nunderlying  Rule  53  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.\nSection A. 7 of the Order of Reference delegated  to the Special\nMaster the \"full power to order and conduct hearings with respect\nto  the  defendants'  compliance  with  this  Court's  orders\",  a\nprovision  explicitly  and  legitimately  based  on  Rule  53(c),\nF.R.Civ.P.  The particular circumstances  underlying  the present\npleadings and the character of the factual evidence to be adduced\nat the hearing warrant the reference to the Special Master of the\nfactual issues concerning the current state of compliance.\nIt must be noted that the Special Master's charter in this\nregard is narrow and consists only of the evidence described in\n\nSections  III. A,  B,  and  C  of  this  order.  This  evidence  will\nconsist of that offered by the plaintiffs in their case in chief\nto  establish  the  defendants  failure  to  comply with  the  Court's\nremedial orders, that offered by the defendants on their state of\ncompliance, and the plaintiffs' rebuttal evidence relating to the\ndefendants-'  compliance.  \"This  evidence  related  to  only  a\nfragment  of  the  factual  issues  that  are  before  the  Court  by\nvirtue. of  the  pending  pleadings.  As  outlined  in  Section -III,\nabove, the state of compliance  is a central issue in the pending\nmotions  for  contempt  and  modification  but  it  is  only  one  of\nseveral  such  issues.  Of parallel importance are the affirmative\ndefenses  raised  in  the  defendants'  response  to  the  plaintiffs'\nAmended  Motion  and  the  various  claims the parties have  advanced\nin support of their motions  for modification.  To the extent the\nevidence, the parties  adduce  in support  of these matters  extends\nbeyond  the  limited question of the state of compliance  with  the\nCourt's  orders,  that  evidence  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this\nreference and will be heard by the Court.\nReference  of  the  portion  of  the  proceedings  described  in\nSections  III.A,  B  and  C  to  the  Special  Master  is,  as  noted,\nconsistent  with  the _ Order  of  Reference.  That  decree  will  be\nmodified,  however,  to  the  limited  extent  of  extending  to  the\nDeputy Special Master the powers described  in Section A.7 of the\nOrder  of  Reference  and  in  Rule  53(c),  F.R.Civ.P.  Thus,  for\npurposes  of  the present  reference  the Court's order of June 22,\n1983  which,  inter  alia,  appointed  Frederick  Byers  to  serve  as\nDeputy Special Master,  is modified  to the  extent  it  limited  the\n\nDeputy Special Master's powers to those set forth in sections A.I\nthrough A.6 of the Order of Reference.  For the purposes of the\ncurrent  reference,  the  Deputy  Special  Master  shall  have  co-\nextensive with  the  Special  Master,  the  full  power  to  order  and\nconduct  hearings  with  respect  to  the  defendants'  state  of\ncompliance.  To that end, he shall exercise the powers  described\nin Rule 53(c),  F.R.Civ.p.\nThe Special Master and Deputy Special Master shall exercise\ntheir  powers  \"to  regulate  all  proceedings\"  in  conjunction  with\nthe  Court  to  ensure  that  the  factual  record  they  compile  as a\nresult of  this  reference  is  thorough  within  the  limits  of  this\nreference.  To the extent discovery  issues that arise during the\nparties' pretrial preparations relate solely to compliance, those\nissues  are  to  be  presented  to  the  Special  Master  or  Deputy\nSpecial  Master  for  resolution.  At  their  discretion,  they  may\nconsult with  the Court  for guidance on these issues, and may in\ntheir discretion  and  upon  notice  to  the parties  refer  any  such\nissues to the Court for resolution.\nAlthough  the incorporation  in this reference of the express\npowers of Rule 53(c) plainly comprehends such matters, the Court\nwishes  to  make  clear  that  this  reference  empowers  the  Special\nMaster  and  Deputy  Special  Master  to issue directives  concerning\nthe form in which evidence will be received.  In this regard, the\nCourt  observes  that  the  entire  factual  record  submitted  to  the\nCourt  relevant  to  the  plaintiffs'  Motion  for  a  Preliminary\nInjunction  in June  1983 was  submitted  in the  form of  deposition\ntestimony  and  documentary  evidence.  The  Court  found  this\n21\n\nprocedure to be of considerable value and economy and encourages\nits  use,, to  the  extent  feasible,  in  the  proceedings  to  be\nconducted by the Special Master and Deputy Special Master.\nUpon the conclusion of the hearing on the defendants'- state\nof  compliance,  and  pursuant  to  Rule  53(e),  F.R.Civ.P.,  the\nSpecial Master and the Deputy Special Master shall file a report\ncontaining  proposed  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law\nrelating to the defendants' past and present state of compliance\nin accordance with  this order.  Either party may object to the\nreport as provided in Rule 53(e)(2), F.R.Civ.P.\nV.  TRIAL SCHEDULE\nThe  hearing  by  the  Special  Master  and  the Deputy  Special\nMaster will be convened on December 1, 1986 at 9:00 a.m. in the\nUnited States Courthouse in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The hearing\nbefore the Court, on the defendants' affirmative defenses and the\nparties' motions for modification will commence at 9:30 a.m. on\nDecember 15, 1986 in the United States Courthouse in Albuquerque,\nNew  Mexico.  For  the  purpose  of guiding  the parties  in their\ntrial  preparations,  the  Court  will  establish  the  following\npretrial schedule.\nA.  Discovery\nDiscovery  is to be reopened as of the date of this order.\nThe  discovery  period  shall  run  without  interruption  until\nNovember  14,  1986.  The  parties  shall  attempt  to  establish\nbetween  themselves  reasonable  time  limits  for  discovery,\nincluding periods for answering interrogatories and requests for\nadmission.  If they are unable to do so by October 17, they shall\n22\n\napproach the Court for guidance.  In the event issues relating r. to\ndiscovery  arise  between  the  parties  that  they  are  unable  to\nresolve,  those  issues,  if  they  relate  solely  to  the  state  of\ncompliance,  should  be  presented  to  the  Special  Master  and  the\nDeputy  Special  Master.  All  other  issues  concerning  discovery\nshould be presented to the Court.\nB. . Pretrial Order\nNo  later  than  November  21, 1986, the parties  shall  file a\njointly prepared  form of proposed pretrial order.  That document\nshall include:  a) agreed statements of law; b) agreed  statements\nof fact (the findings of fact filed by the Special Master may be\nincorporated by reference); c) separate statements by the parties\nas  to  contested  issues  of  law.; d)  narrative  statements  of  any\ntestimony  to  be  adduced  from  live  witnesses;  e)  narrative\nsummaries of all evidence  to be  introduced  in documentary  form,\nincluding deposition testimony and exhibit evidence; f) a list of\nall  exhibits  intended  to  be  offered  by  the  parties  and  a\nstatement of whether the other party objects to that exhibit; g)\nthe names of any expert witnesses either party wishes to call; h)\nfor  each  such  witness, a  narrative  of  the  expert's  credentials\nsuitable  for  introduction  into  evidence;  and  i)  for  each  such\nwitness,  a  statement  of  whether  the  party  on  the  other  side\nintends  to  object  to  the  individual's  qualifications  as  an\nexpert.  Together with the joint pretrial order, each party shall\nfile  proposed  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  for  the\nCourt's consideration.\n\n3 <\nday  of  October,  1986\nI United  Sites\n24",

AIpodaIca ll\nIN  THE  UNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT  \"NrTED STATES DISTRO COURT\nALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nMAY - 2 1994\nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.,  _\nP inti«s,  ^\nla\nVS.  Civ. NO. 77-0721-JB\nBRUCE KING, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER\nOn March  18, 1994  the  special  master  filed  his Report  on\nMental Health Services. That special master's report incorporated\na report (denominated Mental Health Services. New Mexico Department\nof Corrections. March 1994^ prepared by two experts retained by the\nspecial master, Henry Dlugacz, CSW, JD, and Melissa Warren, Ph.D.\nThe special master recommended that the Court confirm the factual\nfindings of the experts' report and order the defendants to address\npromptly the six key topics noted in the conclusion to the report\nas requiring immediate attention. Those issues are the following:\n(1) screening  and  assessment  at  Reception  &  Diagnostic  Center\n(RDC); (2) proper treatment of impaired inmates who are assigned to\nadministrative segregation; (3) organization and strengthening of\nthe Central Office; (4) improvement of recruitment and retention;\n(5) an acceptable plan for housing women who require intermediate\ncare; and  (6) improvement of the qualifications and training of\nstaff to acceptable professional standards.\nNo party filed any objections to the report. The plaintiffs\nfiled a response urging the Court to confirm the report. Plaintiffs\npointed out that new mental health leadership in the Department of\n\nCorrections already is using the findings and recommendations of\nthe report to address  deficiencies. Plaintiffs  also noted  that\ndefendants' corrective action plan must be completed promptly and\nimplemented expeditiously  if defendants are to have any hope of\nachieving substantial compliance by the end of 1994.\nDefendants  also  filed  a  response  to  the  report.  Although\ndefendants specifically stated that they were not objecting to the\nreport, they  asserted  that the report contains certain  factual\nerrors, and is an incomplete picture of the status of mental health\ncare  in the  Department  of  Corrections. Accordingly,  defendants\nurged the Court not to confirm the factual findings of the report.\nDefendants, however, noted their agreement with the experts and the\nspecial master that the six enumerated topics listed above require\n\"immediate and sustained attention\" (Defendants' Response, p. 4),\nand they assured the Court that these six areas of concern will be\nthe focus of defendants' primary  efforts  in the area of mental\nhealth care during 1994.\nDefendants pointed out in their response that the report does\nnot cover all aspects of mental health care in the Department of\nCorrections.  As  the  special  master  noted  at  page  two  of  his\ncovering report, the experts' report does not purport to address\nall aspects of mental health care delivery. The Court notes with\napproval and accepts as highly informative the December 23, 1993\nmemorandum on compliance in four areas of mental health care as\nrequired  by  the  decree, which  is  attached  to  the  defendants'\nresponse. The  Court, however, does not view the  fact  that  the\n\nreport does not cover all possible topics within the broad range of\nmental health care issues addressed by the decree as requiring the\nCourt to refrain from confirming the report.\nDefendants also state that the report's factual findings are\ndeficient. With respect to the two specific examples defendants put\nforward for this proposition, however, the defendants' position can\nmore accurately be characterized as disagreement with the degree of\nthe problem discussed  in the report, rather than denial of the\nproblem's  existence.  In  connection  with  concerns  the  experts\nexpressed about mental health care delivery to segregated inmates\nhoused at the PNM North facility, for example, defendants assert\nthat, while problems exist, the report overstates them. Similarly\nwith respect to the delivery of mental health care to women at\nNMWCF,  defendants  do  not  deny  the  existence  of  the  specific\ndeficiencies  identified by the experts, but instead assert that\ndespite those deficiencies, the majority of the women assigned to\nNMWCF who require mental health care are receiving it.\nLike plaintiffs, defendants discuss in their response the new\nleadership in the Department of Corrections in the mental health\narea,  and  the  fact  that  this  new  leadership  is  hard  at  work\ndeveloping a corrective action plan that reflects the findings and\nrecommendations of the report. The Court agrees with the parties\nthat these are positive developments. The Court, however, also\nagrees  with  plaintiffs  that  it  is  imperative  that  defendants\nimmediately complete the plan and begin its implementation.\nThe  Court  accepts  the  special  master's  observations  and\n\nrecommendations concerning the report. The report appears to be\nthorough,  thoughtful,  and  accurate.  The  Court  understands  and\naccepts  that  the  report  is  not  a  comprehensive  review  of  all\naspects of mental health care in the Department of Corrections, but\nit  is  worthy  of  confirmation  as  to  the  areas  it  does  cover.\nAlthough  defendants  have  noted  their  disagreement  with  certain\nfindings in the report, their reservations relate more to matters\nof degree than questions of fact.\nAccordingly, the Court being fully advised in the premises and\nfor good cause shown,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the factual findings of the experts'\nreport entitled Mental Health Services  New Mexico Department of\n r\nCorrections, March 1994, prepared for the special master by Henry\nDlugacz, CSW, JD, and Melissa Warren, Ph.D., shall be and hereby\nare confirmed.\nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  defendants  shall  address\nimmediately  the  following  six  topics  and  provide  sustained\nattention  to them until  they  achieve  substantial  compliance  in\nthese areas: (1) screening and assessment at the RDC; (2) proper\ntreatment of impaired inmates who are assigned to administrative\nsegregation;  (3) organization  and  strengthening  of  the  Central\nOffice;  (4)  improvement  of  recruitment  and  retention;  (5)  an\nacceptable plan for housing women who require intermediate care;\nand (6) improvement of the qualifications and training of staff to\nacceptable professional standards.\nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  defendants  immediately  shall\n\npromulgate  a ' corrective  action  plan  in  connection  with  the\ndeficiencies noted in the report, and all other aspects of mental\nhealth care required to be addressed by the decree in this case,\nand shall provide plaintiffs' counsel and the special master with\na copy of that plan. That plan shall provide for defendants to\nachieve substantial compliance with this Court's decree on mental\nhealth no later than December 31, 1994.\nJuan G. Burciaga\n(Cklef Judge",

Apodaca\nFILED\nUNFTED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nPC-NM-001-026\nALBUQUERQUE, NEW MSCCO.\nIN THE UNTIED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nDWIGHT DURAN, et aL, CLERK\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civil No. 77--0721-JB\nBRUCE KING, etal.,\nENTERED ON DOCKET\nDefendants. 9\nO R D ER\nIntroduction\nOn June 10, 1991, the parties filed a proposed Settlement Agreement in this cause.  The\nagreement is the result of negotiations that commenced following the Court's directions set forth\noriginally in its order of August 8, 1990, and iterated in its order of October 3, 1990.  The\nparties were directed in those to attempt to reach agreement on (1) all issues that were then the\nsubject of Plaintiffs' pending contempt motion, (2) all modifications of the Consent Decree in\nthis case Defendants  intended to seek, and  (3) a timetable for the termination  of external\nmonitoring and reporting by the Special Master and the orderly vacation of the remedial orders\nin mis cause following a finding of compliance with the terms of those orders.\nBy order of June 18, 1991, the Court provisionally approved the Settlement Agreement,\nfinding that it appeared to be fair and reasonable and to operate in the best interests of the\nPlaintiff Class. Because the agreement constitutes a compromise of a class action, however, the\nprovisions of Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that members of the\nclass be given appropriate notice of the terms of the settlement.\n\nProvision of Adequate Notice\nTo meet the requirements of Rule 23(e), the Court directed counsel to prepare a joint\nform of notice. That notice, as well as an Amended Joint Statement Regarding Rule 23 Process,\nwas presented by counsel and approved by the Court on July 2, 1991.  The form of notice set\nforth a brief but accurate description of the salient provisions of the Settlement Agreement and\nidentified inmates at each affected  institution to serve as members of Plaintiffs'  Attorneys'\nCommittees from whom class members could obtain additional information about the terms of\nthe agreement  The notice also identified one attorney for the class and a former named Plaintiff\nto whom inquiries could be directed.  The notice provided that written objections could be tiled\nwith the Clerk of the Court on or before August 21, 1991, and informed members of the class\nthat a formal hearing on the terms of the agreement would be held on August 30, 1991.\nThe Amended Joint Statement provided for the posting of the approved notice in the law\nlibrary, general library, dining facilities, recreational facilities, and other bulletin boards in areas\nof each affected institution.  Moreover, both the notice and the entire text of the Settlement\nAgreement,  including  attachments,  were required  to  be provided  to  each  inmate  in  any\nsegregated housing unit  Copies of the entire Settlement Agreement were required to be made\navailable to general population inmates in the general library  and the law library  of each\ninstitution.\nBy the terms of the Amended Joint Statement, i*m****  serving as members of the\nPlaintiffs' Attorneys' Committees were permitted access to all housing units to meet with class\nmembers, explain the provisions of the Settlement Agreement, and accept inquiries about the\ndocument  At each institution, a location was to be set aside for meetings among committee\n\nmembers and other members of the class.  The Amended Joint Statement further provided for\nwritten communication and telephone contact between committee members and Plaintiffs' counsel\nand their paralegal.\nThe Amended Joint Statement scheduled two meetings among Plaintiffs' counsel and the\nPTafntiflV Attorneys' Committee members representing each institution.  One of these meetings\nwas attended by Mr. Alvin Bronstein; the Director of the National Prison Project, who served\nas lead counsel during the negotiations leading to the Settlement Agreement, and both meetings\nwere attended by local counsel.\nPlaintiffs' counsel were required by the Amended Joint Statement to provide the Court\nwith a summary of objections, by category, no later than August 28.  The statement concluded\nwith a provision permitting one ^mat* from each affected institution to attend the August 30\nmeeting.\nEvidence presented at that hearing disclosed that the comprehensive notice provisions\nrequired  by  the  Amended  Joint  Statement  were  fulfilled  in  all  but  immaterial  respects.\nApparently, for a brief period of time, incoming inmates at the Reception and Diagnostic Center\nat Western New Mexico Correctional Facility received copies of the Amended Joint Statement\nrather than the notice itself.  This discrepancy was discovered by a member of the Plaintiffs'\nAttorneys* Committee at that institution and was remedied immediately by institutional officials.\nThe committee member at Central New Mexico Correctional Facility was denied access to\ninmates transferred to the acute mental health care unit at that institution on July 29, 1991.\nPrior to the transfer of these inmates, however, they were avrisfrri by a committee member at\ndie Penitentiary of New Mexico - North Facility.  Finally, a number of written objections\n\nsubmitted by inmate* at me New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility inadvertently were\naddressed directly to the Court, rather than to the Clerk, and did not reach Plaintiffs' counsel\nuntil shortly before August 28. Counsel had an opportunity to review these objections, however,\nand  they  are  addressed  in  Plaintiffs'  Memorandum  in  Support  of  Proposed  Settlement\nAgreement, filed on that date.\nIn summary, the Court finds that exceptionally careful and effective efforts were made\nby Plaintiffs'  counsel,  members of the Plaintiff?;'  Attorneys'  Committees, and institutional\nofficials to apprise all members of the class of the terms of the Settlement Agreement  These\nefforts  succeeded  in providing  all members of  the class with  an opportunity  to read  and\nunderstand the agreement and to object to any provision to which they took exception.\nObjections to the Settlement Agreement\nPlaintiffs' counsel filed a detailed memorandum in support of the Settlement Agreement.\nThe  memorandum  sets  form, the background  of  this  litigation  leading  to  the  agreement,\nsummarizes all of its significant provisions, and describes me steps that were taken to ensure\nadequate notice to all class members.  Although the description of the history of the litigation\nmay faMy be described as reflecting only the perspective of Plaintiffs' counsel, it nonetheless\nis helpful in explaining the willingness of Plaintiffs' counsel to accept compromise in certain\nareas that drew objections from class members.\nThe final section of the memorandum identifies numerous objections that were made by\nclass members from each institution.  These included individual objections as well as those set\nforth on wigte petitions signed by many inmates.\n\nOne recurring objection to the Settlement Agreement is that the earlier decision of this\nCourt denying Defendants'  motion to vacate most of the provisions of the Consent Decree\nprecludes modification of that decree. Duron v. Carruihers  678 F. Supp. 839 (D.N.M.), affd.\nr\n885 F.2d  1485 (10th Cir.  1989), CJIL denied.  U.S.  ,  110 S. CL 865 (1990).  As\nPlaintiffs'  counsel point out, this objection reflects a misunderstanding of the import of the\nearlier decision.  Indeed, the Court made it clear in denying Defendants'  motion that, at an\nappropriate time, it would consider any modifications Defendants chose to seek.  678 F. Supp.\nat 853.\nAccording to the memorandum, the \"vast majority\" of objections took exception to the\nfact that members of the Plaintiff rta*s were not at the bargaining table during negotiations\nleading to the Settlement Agreement  Although Plaintiffs'  counsel strongly urged that class\nmembers be present, Defendants would not agree to inmates' participation in this form.  As the\nCourt has noted, the negotiations leading to agreement commenced shortly after August 8,1990,\nand extended until early June 1991. The Court concludes mat it would not have been practicable\nto include inmata representatives in the numerous meetings foat were held during his period and\nfinds that the rights of the class were fully protected by the complete notice class members\nreceived commencing July 8,1991.\nOther objections were addressed to the provisions of the Settlement Agreement permitting\nMmi^ use of day rooms to bouse inmates.  In exchange for this concession, Plaintiffs obtained\na non-modifiable agreement that existing institutions, all but one of which are modem, air-\nconditioned, state of the art facilities, will not be double-celled.  The provision of double-\noccupancy cells in  new  construction  is carefully  limited.  In view  of  the change of law\n\nestablished in Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 (1981), and its progeny, the likelihood that\nDefendants would have prevailed on any motion to modify (he single-celling provision in the\nexisting Consent Decree is high, and tie compromise struck in the Settlement Agreement on this\nissue is one that favors the interests of the class.\nSome TPTPg»re objected to the ultimate termination of the role of the Special Master and\nthe phased vacation of the remedial orders that comprise the Consent Decree.  The agreement\nrequires a finding of substantial performance in advances of termination of monitoring by the\nSpecial Master and provides for a period of reporting and self-monitoring by Defendants before\nvacation of the Consent Decree at any institution.  The population control provisions of the\nSettlement Agreement are permanent in nature.\nAlthough it is understandable that class members would prefer external monitoring in\nperpetuity, the Court's role in this litigation is limited.  When the Consent Decree has achieved\nits intended effect through Defendants' sustained compliance with that decree, the role of the\nCourt as external  monitor must come to an  end.  Thus, in  these respects  the Settlement\nAgreement simply reflects the proper limits of judicial intervention into the operation of New\nMexico's correctional facilities.\nOther objections took issue with the definition of \"substantial compliance\" set forth in\nthe Settlement Agreement. This definition, which appears in the Agreement of the Parties, reads\nas follows:\nFox purposes of this Agreement, \"substantial compliance\" means\nthat defendants generally are in compliance with the terms of the\nCourt's remedial order as it affects a particular area.  Incidents of\nnon-compliance do not necessarily prevent a finding of substantial\ncompliance.  The determination of substantial compliance «fraH\ntake into account the extent to which exceptions to compliance are\n\nsporadic or isolated in nature, are unintentional, are the temporary\nresult of actions by the members of the plaintiff  class and are\npromptly and properly addressed by corrective action and, where\nappropriate, disciplinary action against staff members responsible\nfor the exception to compliance. In no event shall a determination\nof substantial compliance be made if exceptions to compliance are\nthe result of willful or intentional actions by defendants.\nCompliance of Modified Decree, pp. 49-50.  This definition provides reasonable guidelines to\nthe parties as  well as to  the Special Master,  who is responsible for  mairing findings and\nrecommendations that substantial compliance has or has not been achieved. The Court finds that\nthis definition is an appropriate one that provides a fair measure of Defendants' entitlement to\nrelief from continued external monitoring by the Special Master.\nInmates objected to a number of specific modifications of substantive provisions of the\nConsent Decree in the areas of correspondence, classification, administrative segregation, and\ninmate discipline.  The Court has reviewed these objections and the challenged provisions with\ncare and finds that, with one exception, they are without merit.\nNo legitimate interest of inmates is disserved by the modification that permits incoming\nlegal mail to be opened and inspected for contraband in the presence of the addressee.  Indeed,\nas counsel point out in the memorandum, this provision potentially protects inmates from charges\nthat  they  received  contraband  correspondence  from  unintended  correspondents  posing  as\nattorneys.\nThe Court also agrees with Plaintiffs' counsel mat the amended provisions relating to\nclassification to which objections were made are not significant modifications of the Consent\nDecree.  The reduction of the composition of classification committees from, three members to\ntwo and  the ltTnftatTnn  of  input by mental health professionals  to  classification  decisions\n\nregarding inmates receiving mental health treatment are entirely reasonable.  Likewise, potential\ntransfers  of class members to minimum security facilities, which are not the subject of the\nConsent Decree, can hardly be disadvantageous to members of the Duron class housed in higher\nsecurity facflfa'** requiring a greater degree of restriction and surveillance.\nThe carefully crafted changes in the policies and procedures controlling administrative\nsegregation protect inmates' interests while streamlining inefficient and unworkable procedures\ncontained in the Consent Decree.  Moreover,  Defendants' •commitment to a transition unit\ndesigned to reintegrate inmates in this status into the general population, a new provision to\nwhich no inmate objected, is a gain of singular importance to the class.  In summary, the Court\nfinds that the amendments in this area strike a fair balance between the need of Defendants to\nseparate, sometimes for lengthy periods of time, certain inmates from the general population for\nlegitimate reasons of safety and security and the interest of the class in fair procedures that win\nprevent abuse of administrative authority in this area.\nNumerous  objections  were  made  to  changes  in  the  inmate discipline policies  and\nprocedures.  Most of these changes are designed to improve the workability of me system and\nto exercise greater control over misconduct that endangers the security of institutions, inmates,\nand staff.  The Court finds these objections to be without merit, although undoubtedly the\nrevised regulations will discourage certain forms of conduct on the part of some members of the\nclass.  The same is generally true of increased penalties reflected in the Settlement Agreement\nUpon its initial review of the proposed agreement, however, the Court was concerned\nby the extension of disciplinary segregation from 30 days, as prescribed in the Consent Decree,\nto as many as  120 days under the terms of the Settlement Agreement-  This concern was\n8\n\nconfirmed during the course of inspections of all institutions conducted by the Court on August\n8, 9, and 12.  Several wardens stated that the 120-day provision was unnecessary and unlikely\nto be used, particularly at medium custody institutions that have the option to transfer a seriously\ndelinquent iran»tw to the Penitentiary of New Mexico.  Even at that institution, the option of\nlong-term administrative segregation is available as a response to intractable behavior.\nThe Court was pleased, however, to learn at the August 30 hearing that the parties have\nagreed to farther refinement of the Settlement Agreement that will limit sentences to disciplinary\nsegregation to no more than 60 days and any sentence in excess of 30 days must be specifically\napproved by the warden of the institution.  This amendment is tied to certain proposed changes\nhi provisions relating to activity time to be offered to inmates in administrative segregation.  As\na result, these proposed modifications of the Settlement Agreement will be submitted to the\nCourt in the near future and will be the subject of another notice to the class.  Because counsel\nhave assured the Court that the maTi'mum sentence to disciplinary segregation will be reduced\nin accordance with their representations in open court, the Court finds that class members'\nobjections on this subject are moot and should not prevent final approval of the Settlement\nAgreement.\nThe Aqgysti 3ft\nAt the August 30 hearing, counsel for the Defendants and counsel for the Plaintiffs\nstrongly urged the Court to approve the Settlement Agreement  Dwight Duran, former named\nPlaintiff in this case, testified  that the agreement is a fair and balanced resolution of the\ncompeting interests of the parties.  Testimony also was heard from Lawrence Hurd, Reilly\n\nJohnson, Donald Duncan, Jeff Johnson, Evelyn Sandoval, Phillip Cristo, Thaylan Couitwright,\nand Patricio Esquivel, who served as members of the Plaintiffs' Attorneys' Committees at the\ninstitutions.  Most of these inmates testified that they recommended approval of the Settlement\nAgreement, although they acknowledged that, from their perspective as inmates, the agreement\nwas a \"mixed bag.\"  Ms Sandoval declined to express an opinion on the question, and Mr.\nEsquivel, who is confined in administrative segregation at the Penitentiary of New Mexico -\nNorth Facility, argued against confirmation.\nThe Court called Vincent M. Nathan, the Special Master in this case since 1983, to\ntestify.  Mr. Nathan urged the Court to approve the Settlement Agreement, emphasizing the\npermanent gains achieved by the class with respect to avoidance of double-celling.  He opined\nthat permanent achievement of the objectives of the Consent Decree, as modified, would be\nthreatened — indeed, made near impossible -  by overcrowding occasioned by double-celling.\nAs has been noted, the Court toured the facilities on August 8, 9, and 12. During these\ntours, the Court saw firsthand the substantial improvements in conditions that, have been effected\nas a result of this litigation.  The Court was impressed by the evident sincerity and commitment\nof central office and institutional staff to maintain decent and humane facilities in compliance\nwith constitutional standards.\nApproval of the Settlement Agreement\nIn reaching its decision on the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement\nAgreement, see. Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: GvU 2d § 1797.1\n(1986), the Court has been assigned, by an unusually effective notice process that produced\n10\n\nnumerous general and specific objections to the agreement, a thorough and cogent analysis of\nthose  objections  by  Plaintiffs'  counsel,  the  hard  work  and  sincere  testimony  of  inmate\nrepresentatives, the advice of a Special Master with more than nine years of experience in\nmonitoring the detailed provisions of the Consent Decree, the advice of counsel representing\nDefendants and Plaintiffs, and the Court's firsthand observations of the institutions to which the\nSettlement Agreement and  the modified  decree will apply.  That this process has been a\nmeaningful one is attested to by the effect of Inmates' objections to the unnecessary lengthening\nof  sentences  to  disciplinary  segregation  and  by  the  compelling  balance  on  the  part  of\nrepresentatives of the inn^t* class who expressed their views in testimony.\nFor  all  of these reasons,  the Court finds  that the Settlement Agreement is a  fair,\nreasonable, and adequate one, which operates in the best interests of all who ate affected by it.\nAccordingly, it will be approved.\nof the Class\nHaving determined to approve the Settlement Agreement, the Court turns to the last\nmatter before it  A number of inmates raised, in one form or another, a challenge to the\nadequacy of representation afforded the class.  In general, these objections took exception to\ncounsel's decision to abandon pending contempt motions in favor of a negotiated settlement and\nstressed the absence of inmate representatives from the bargaining table.  For reasons that are\ninexplicable to the Court, a number of objecting inmates relied upon expressions of support for\nthe agreement by Dwight Duran,  a fonner  named Plaintiff  in this action,  as evidence of\ninadequacy of representation.\n11\n\nOver the course of more than nine years, the Court has observed the resolute efforts of\nPlaintiffs' counsel and the dedication of Mr. Duran on behalf of the interests of class members\nthroughout New Mexico.  Those efforts produced substantial improvement in conditions over\nthose in existence in 1980, when the tragic riot at the Penitentiary of New Mexico occurred.\nThese improvements occurred largely during the administration of former Secretary Michael\nFrancke between 1982 and 1986. litigation ensued shortly after Secretary Francke was-replaced\nin 1987, and a new administration devoted its efforts to attempting to upset the Consent Decree\nrather than to comply with it.  During the course of that lengthy litigation, there was little the\nCourt, the Special Master, or Plaintiffs' counsel could do to bring about compliance with the\nConsent Decree until the legitimacy of that order was established through lengthy proceedings\nat the trial court and at the appellate stage.  In due course, that vindication was achieved, to no\nsmall extent, through the efforts of Plaintiffs' counsel.\nDuring the nearly four years that were lost in this process, necessary modifications could\nhave been  negotiated  or,  failing  agreement,  could  have been presented  to  the  Court  for\nresolution.  Valuable time could have been devoted to achieving compliance with the decree, as\nmodified, and the likelihood is that by today the Court1 s involvement in mis litigation could have\nbeen ended. The delay occasioned by Defendants1 resistance, however, cannot be laid at the feet\nof Plaintiffs' counsel, whose efforts always have been to protect to the maximum extent possible\nthe constitutional rights of their clients as reflected in the Consent Decree.\nAlthough the vindication of the Court's power to enforce the Consent Decree ultimately\noccurred and a change of administration in 1991 resulted in renewed commitment to compliance\non the part of State officials, modification of that decree has long been inevitable.  This is true\n12\n\nboth because certain of its provisions have proved over the years to be unworkable and because\nchanges in the substantive law relating to institutional reform have narrowed the scope of\nrecognteed rights of inmates and cast doubt on the continuing effect  of remedial decrees in\ninstitutional reform litigation.  Plaintiffs' counsel cannot be faulted for recognizing these factors\nand for their commitment to engage in good faith negotiations to protect their clients from\nwholesale modification of a decree that, in the main, has been demonstrated to be workable and\nfair.  Counsel's conscientious efforts to this end are to be applauded and surely provide no basis\nfor criticism of the quality of representation the Duron class has enjoyed since the inception of\nthis litigation.  This is particularly true in view of the end result of those efforts:  a modified\ndecree that protects the legitimate interests of the Plaintiff Gass and ensures mat inmates in New\nMexico, unlit? those in most other jurisdictions, will never suffer the disastrous effects of gross\novercrowding.\nAccordingly, the Court finds that objections to the adequacy of representation of the class\nare  spurious.  In particular,  the efforts  of counsel that resulted  in the  submission  of the\nSettlement Agreement reflect the highest standards of professional  conduct and of  effective\nrepresentation of the diverse interests of New Mexico's several thousand inmates.\nWherefore, for the reasons set forth above,\nIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED as follows:\n1.  All objections to the aforementioned Settlement Agreement are overruled;\n2.  AIL objections to the adequacy of representation of the class are overruled; and\n13\n\n3.  The Settlement Agreement and the modified remedial decrees resulting from that\nagreement are finally approved in all respects.  The effective date of the Settlement Agreement\nshall be the date of this order.\nDATED at Albuquerque this 19th day of September, 1991.\nrrjXJAN G. BURCIAGA\n1/  Chief Judge\n14",

Suite 223\nP.O. Drawrrv>570\n*ama Ft. N.M. 87504\n\nresolve disputes or matters  such as this one informally.  In\ntheir June  4, 1985  letter to Plaintiffs' counsel, Defendants\nstated  that  because  of  recent  developments  concerning  this\nissue, they would assume that informal efforts to resolve this\nmatter would be futile, unless Plaintiffs were to notify them\nto the contrary.  Plaintiffs have not  so notified  Defendants\nand  Defendants  therefore  are  submitting  this  matter  to  the\nCourt.\nThe Consent Decree, agreed to by the parties, provides\nprocedures,  standards  and  burdens  for  changing  its  terms.\nAccording to paragraph 6 of the general Agreement, Defendants\nmust now justify to the Court that the \". . .change or changes\nshould be made and will not lessen the benefits provided by the\nagreement  and  the  policies  attached  hereto  and  the  partial\nconsent  decrees  on  file herein  before  the  change or  changes\nwill be allowed.\"\nII.\nTHE CHANGES DEFENDANTS SEEK SHOULD BE MADE\nDefendants are concerned with providing as much phys-\nical safety as possible to all inmates and  staff in the New\nMexico correctional  system.  Notwithstanding  efforts to date,\nhowever, violence has often existed in New Mexico institutions.\nInmates  have  been  killed,  maimed,  otherwise  seriously\nphysically injured and subjected to various forms of extortion.\nCorrections  Department  staff have been the targets of  inmate\nJCHEUER & E.NTGEL. P.C.\nAttorneys ai Uw\n125 Lincoln Avc. Suite 223 - 2 -\nP.O. Drawer 9570\nSintiFe. N.M. S75O4\n(505)982-9911\n\nviolence,  resulting  in  staff  deaths  and  serious  injuries.\nDefendants are asking  this Court to give them the tools and\nprocedures to drastically  reduce and, if possible, completely\neliminate this climate of violence and its tragic consequences.\nIt would  be naive to posit  that  violence  could not\nexist in the absence of weapons.  It would be equally naive to\nassume that weapons do not contribute to the degree, intensity\nand frequency of violence in an environment which assumes and\naccepts  weapons  as  instrumentalities  of  manipulation  and\nintimidation.  The fact is that \". . .instruments  capable of\ncausing death or serious physical  injury. . .\", when used in\nthe \"proper\" circumstances, can cause death or serious physical\ninjury.  It is not necessarily the skill of the possessor or\nuser of the weapon which makes death or serious physical injury\npossible,  it is  instead  the nature  of the weapon  itself.\nPersons will, if possible, arm themselves with instruments and\nweapons capable of helping them achieve the desired result.  In\na prison setting, since there is no possible legitimate use for\ncontraband weapons, their mere existence will inevitably lead\nto  their use and that use will  inevitably  lead to death or\nserious physical injury to inmates or staff.\nEliminating dangerous, contraband weapons is therefore\nonly  a  logical, basic  and sensible  step  toward  eliminating\nkillings,  maimings,  stabbings,  threats  and  other  forms of\nextortion.  The metaphysical argument \"guns do not kill people,\npeople kill people\", is only that.  In the real world, it is\nSCHEUER & ENGEL. P.C.\nAftornev* ir Liw\n125 Lincoln Avc. Suite 12) - 3 -\nP.O. Dtawcr\\>5\"0\nSanta Fe. N M. 3\"504\n\nimpossible  for people  to kill people  with  guns, unless  they\nhave guns.  In a prison setting, as in the real world, it is\nimpossible for persons to cause other persons death or serious\nphysical  injury  with  dangerous  weapons,  if  they  are  not\navailable.\nPlaintiffs  may  argue  that  if weapons  are  taken  away\nfrom  the  inmate  population  at  large, a  result  will  be  that\nstronger  inmates will be able  to prey  on weaker  inmates and\nweaker  inmates  will  have  lost  their  protection  and  defense\nbecause  of  their  loss  of weapons.  This  would  be  sophistry\nreduced to dangerous rhetoric.  If such a proposition were to\nbe given even passing consideration, a logical corollary would\nbe that weaker inmates should be armed with dangerous weapons,\nin order to  equalize  their  status with  stronger  inmates who\nwould not be armed.  Some form of status quo would then have to\nbe  presumed,  accepting  the  notion  that  the  weaker,  armed\ninmates  would  never  use  them  against  the  stronger,  unarmed\ninmates or against the staff of institutions in which they are\nconfined.  As a footnote, it is common correctional practice to\nforbid the possession of any weapons by correctional officers\nand staff while working in prisons.  The reason, of course, is\nthat it is too dangerous to allow \"legitimate\" weapons inside\nthe institutions.  To presume that weaker inmates who have been\nallowed  to  possess  dangerous  weapons  would  never  use  them\nagainst  arguably  stronger  inmates or staff would be at best\nirresponsible.\n;CHEUER & E.N'GEL.

If weapons are eliminated, the potential\nfor violence against inmates and staff is dramatically reduced\nand, in many cases, eliminated.  Defendants have been unable,\ngiven the sanctions available, to completely prevent the intro-\nduction, possession, manufacture and use of weapons within New\nMexico prisons.  In order to further the process of completely\neliminating weapons, Defendants seek the Court's assistance in\nproviding  them  with  the  essential  and  necessary  tools  to\naccomplish that end.\nUntil-  recently,  \".  .  .possession,  introduction,  or\nmanufacture of a sharpened instrument, tool, or knife. . .\" was\npunishable by confinement in disciplinary segregation for only\n20  days  and  loss  of  good  time  not  exceeding  120  days.  A\ndisciplinary  violation  of  this  nature  was  a  minor  offense.\nRecently, Defendants  filed a motion, unopposed by Plaintiffs'\ncounsel,  seeking  a  new  category  \"A\"  major  offense  for  the\n\". . .possession,  introduction,  or  manufacture  of  any\ncontraband  instrument  which  is  capable  of  causing  death  or\nserious physical injury.\"  By this Court's order, such a change\nwas approved and this disciplinary violation is now punishable\nby segregation for up to 30 days and/or loss of good time not\nto exceed 180 days.\nThe new category \"A\" major offense, although a step in\nthe  right  direction,  is  clearly  insufficient  to  alter  the\nlong-standing climate of violence and the habits and attitudes\n3CHEUER & ENGEL, P.C.\nAttorney at Li*\ni:i Lincoln Avc.

An  additional  10  days  in\ndisciplinary  segregation  and  an additional  60 days  potential\nloss of good time will not provide much greater disincentives\nthan those which existed before the change.\nBy  this  Motion,  Defendants  seek  the  Court's  order\nchanging the Maximum Security Policy Statement of the Consent\nDecree to allow them to place in maximum security, inmates who\nhave  been  found  guilty  in  the  disciplinary  process  of\npossession,  introduction  or  manufacture  of  a  contraband\ninstrument capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\nThe  Consent  Decree,  as  it  is  now  drafted,  does  not  allow\nDefendants to take such action.\nDefendants'  theory  that  curtailing  or  eliminating\ndangerous weapons  is directly  related  to reduction  in inmate\nviolence is not conceived in a vacuum and is not unsupported in\nfact.  Sound, modern correctional practices support the conclu-\nsion that the only  important variable  in controlling  weapons\nwithin  prison  environments  is  strong  and  sufficient\ndisciplinary  sanctions  against  such  practices.  Defendants\nrespectfully  refer  the Court  to  the Affidavits  of George E.\nSullivan,  Dareld  Kerby  and  Eloy  Mondragon,  attached  to  the\ninstant Motion as Exhibits \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\".\nGeorge Sullivan, a respected corrections professional,\ncurrently  Warden  of  the  Penitentiary  of  New  Mexico,  and  an\nexpert  in  the  field  of  corrections,  has  concluded  that\nCHEUER & E.N'GEL, P.C.\nAttorney* n Uw\n125 Lincoln Avc Suite 223 - 6 -\nP.O. Drawer9570\nSanta Fe. N'.M. 37504\n\nweapons-free  or relatively  weapons-free  institutions  are the\nresult  of one factor and one factor  only,  strong  sanctions\nenforced  against the possession  and use of weapons.  Warden\nSullivan has also concluded, after familiarizing  himself with\nthe operations and the situation at the Penitentiary  of New\nMexico and after becoming acquainted with wardens in other New\nMexico prisons, that the problem of weapons in prisons and the\nviolence  attendant  thereto  can be virtually  eliminated, if\nprison administrators are given the sanctions which Defendants\nseek.\nAt this time, Defendants are unable to take sufficient\naction  to  adequately  discourage  the possession  and use of\ncontraband weapons within their institutions.  In effect, their\nhands are tied by the terms of the Consent Decree.\nIII.\nTHE DEFENDANTS1 PROPOSED CHANGES\nWILL NOT LESSEN, AND WILL INCREASE,\nTHE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE CONSENT\nDECREE AND RELATED POLICIES AND ORDERS\nThe parties to this litigation agreed to the entry of\nthe Consent Decree, in order to provide the benefits contained\nin it to all members of the Plaintiff class, not to a favored\nfew.  In fact, however, much of Plaintiffs1  counsel's efforts\nin the last two years, since the Order of Reference was entered\nby this Court, have been directed to redressing grievances of\nindividuals  within the class, rather  than  grievances  of the\nPlaintiff  class  as  a  whole.  What  Defendants  intend  to\nSCHEUER & EXGEL, PC.\n125 Lincoln Ave.. Suite 223 - 7 -\nP.O. Drawer 0570\nSanta Fc. N M. 8\"504\n\naccomplish  if  this  Court  grants  this  Motion  is  to  more\ncompletely enable all members of the Plaintiff class to receive\nand enjoy the benefits which the Consent Decree guarantees.\nProtective custody status in a penal institution is the\ndirect  result of any individual  inmate's need for protection\nfrom other inmates.  Any inmate in protective custody, simply\nby the nature of the assignment itself, is in seme way deprived\nof benefits of the Consent Decree which other inmates not so\nclassified are able to enjoy.\nWarden Sullivan's Affidavit, supported by the Affida-\nvits of Wardens Mondragon and Kerby, clearly demonstrates that\nprotective  custody  status is directly  related to inmate vio-\nlence, which is in turn directly related to the possession and\nuse of dangerous weapons by inmates in an institution.  As set\nforth in the Affidavits, New Mexico has had and does have a\ncontinuing  problem of a large protective  custody  population.\nFurthermore, as Warden Sullivan's Affidavit demonstrates, there\nare many persons in the general population of the Penitentiary\nof New Mexico who, for reasons generally involving the fear of\nretribution for requesting protective custody, are in essence\n\"captives\" within the general population of stronger, and often\narmed, inmates.\nDefendants are responsible for providing the benefits\nand guarantees of the Consent Decree to the entire  Plaintiff\nclass.  In  order  for them  to do so, the administrative,\n:CHEUER & ENGEL. P.C.\n.Z\") Lincoln Avc. Suice 223 - 8 -\nP.O. Drawer';5\"0\nSanta Fe. N.M. 3\"504\n\ndisciplinary sanctions sought by way of the instant Motion are\nan absolute necessity.\nIf there are members of the Plaintiff class who would\nseek to deprive other members, through their use or possession\nof  dangerous  weapons, of  the  benefits  to  which  those  other\nmembers may be entitled by the Consent Decree, their arguments\nmust  be  disregarded.  In the  event  that  such  a  division  of\ninterest  exists, the Plaintiff  class  should perhaps be  split\ninto subclasses, with these inmates who wish to argue against\nthe Motion at hand represented by one set of counsel and those\nwhose  benefits  will  be  increased  by  the  changes  which\nDefendants  seek  represented  by  other  counsel.  Defendants\ncontend, however, that this is unnecessary in that the changes\nsought by this Motion will be of benefit to all members of the\nPlaintiff class, if the procedures requested are allowed by the\nCourt to be implemented.\nThis Consent Decree involves the totality of conditions\nin the  New Mexico  correctional  system.  In  its negotiation,\nwithout doubt concessions were sought and given by both sides\nand  errors were made.  If  the  failure  to negotiate  stronger\ndisciplinary  sanctions  for  possession  and  use  of  dangerous\nweapons  was  an  error,  Defendants  now  seek  to  correct  that\nerror.  If it was instead and more likely the result of lack of\ninformation and knowledge, this Court's continuing jurisdiction\nand the Decree itself allow changes, now that there is a clear\nawareness of the need to control weapons and predators and a\n5CHEUER 3c E.NGEL.

I  make  this  Affidavit  in  support  of  Defendants'\nMotion to Modify  the Maximum Security  Policy  Statement  of  the\nConsent Decree herein.\n3.  I became Warden of the Penitentiary  of New Mexico\nat Santa Fe, New Mexico  on January  7, 19 85 and have held  the\nposition of Warden since that date.\n4.  I have attached as Exhibit \"A\" to this Affidavit my\npersonal history resume consisting of 21 pages, which provides\na reasonably comprehensive outline of my personal, educational\nand employment background.\n5.  I have appeared and qualified as an expert witness\nin the field of corrections in the following:\nEXHIBIT \"A\" TO MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS1\nMOTION TO MODIFY THE MAXIMUM SECURITY POLICY STATEMENT\nOF THE CONSENT. DECREE - Page 1 of 9 pages\n\na.  On behalf of the Attorney General of the State\nof California, in the Superior Court, Marin County.\nb.  On behalf of the Attorney General of the State\nof Arizona, in the Superior Court, Maricopa County.\nc.  On behalf of inmate plaintiffs in United States\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York.\nd.  On numerous occasions, as a party defendant in\nUnited States District Court, District of Oregon, where I gave\ntestimony in the nature of expert testimony.\n6.  During  my  12  years  and  three  months  corrections\ncareer and employment at the Oregon State Penitentiary  (inmate\npopulation:  1,750) and 17J years at the Oregon State Correc-\ntional  Institution  (inmate  population:  1,030),  those  two\ninstitutions were regarded as among the finest in the nation in\nthe  area  of  security  control.  The  wardens  of  those  insti-\ntutions received many letters from national corrections leaders\nand  authorities  who  had  visited  the  institutions  and  which\nsupported  the  high  quality  of  security  control  at  the\ninstitutions.  In addition, approximately  five years ago, the\nUnited States Bureau of Prisons sponsored a team of 15 federal\nwardens, headed by Sherman Day, then Director of the National\nInstitute  of Corrections, who  inspected  the  institutions  and\nsimilarly had high praise for the quality of security control\nat. the institutions.\n7.  The  Oregon  institutions  also  received  very  KTglr\nmarks in the areas of maintenance, sanitation  and quality of\n- 2 -\n\nlife  for  both  inmates  and  staff.  In  my  opinion,  the  high\nquality  level  of  security  control  is  directly  and\nproportionately related to the higher quality of life that was\nand can be provided  for inmates and  staff  in Oregon and any\nother institution.  Without a high level of security control,\nit is impossible to provide a good quality of life for inmates\nand staff within a correctional institution.\n8.  In  Oregon,  both  institutions  were  essentially\nweapons  free.  It  was  an  extremely  rare  occurrence  for  an\ninmate to be found in possession of a weapon or for an inmate\nweapon to be found within either of the institutions.\n9.  As a result of the weapons-free environment in the\ninstitutions, it was possible to control predatory inmates and,\nexcept  for  very  short  term  classification  and  counseling\nprocesses, neither institution was required to assign inmates\nto \"protective custody\".\n10.  In my  opinion,  any  form  of  \"protective  custody\"\nrepresents  the  end  result  of  poor  correctional  practice.  I\nco-authored the drafting of a paper supporting this proposition\nentitled  Challenge:  Abort  Protective  Custody,  and  have\nattached a draft copy of it to this Affidavit as Exhibit \"B\".\n11.  In the Oregon correctional system, any inmate found\nin possession of a weapon was subject to severe disciplinary\nsanctions, including up to six months  in disciplinary  segre-\ngation and potentially unlimited  assignment to administrative\nsegregation.  I  have  attached  copies  of  the  reiei\n- 3 -\n\ndisciplinary code and administrative segregation regulations of\nthe State of Oregon to this Affidavit as Exhibits \"C\" and \"D\".\n12.  The State of Oregon rules governing procedures for\nprocessing disciplinary actions and administrative  segregation\nof  inmates  resulted  from  the  directed  mediation  of  those\npolicies  by  the  Honorable  James  Burns, Chief  Judge,  United\nStates District Court, District of Oregon, Portland, Oregon, in\na  prison  conditions  lawsuit  in his  court.  The  negotiations\nbetween the parties were mediated by Allen Breed, then Director\nof  the  National  Institute  of  Corrections,  and  the  mediated\nresult was presented to Judge Burns and accepted by him.\n13.  Additionally, Oregon criminal statutes provided for\npotential prosecution of an inmate in possession of a weapon,\nas a felony, with a sentence possibility of up to 20 years in\nprison.\n14.  During my career as a corrections professional, I\nhave  traveled  extensively  throughout  the  United  States  and\nBritish Columbia, visiting and inspecting numerous correctional\ninstitutions, both state and federal, as chairman of the audit\nteams  auditing  the  institutions'  compliance  with  national\nstandards promulgated by the American Correctional Association\n(ACA)  and  Commission  on  Accreditation  for  Corrections\nCompliance  to  determine  whether  or  not  the  institution  was\naccreditable under the national standards.\n15.  In my  opinion, at the Oregon  correctional insti-\ntutions and at other state and federal institutions which are\n- 4 -\n\nweapons-free  or  relatively  weapons-free,  the  common  factor\nwhich contributes to that weapons-free environment is a strong\nprogram of potential sanctions, administrative and statutory,\nwhich provide a major deterrent to inmates possessing weapons.\nPotential sanctions are the only important variable for control\nof weapons in an institution.  In the absence of sufficient and\nstrong sanctions, inmates lack strong disincentives to possess\nor use weapons in an institution.\n16.  In my  opinion, a weapons-free  institution  is the\nonly  variable  which  can  influence  the  possibility  of  an\ninstitution  eliminating  the  category  of  \"protective  custody\"\nfor inmates.  Although weapons  themselves may not hurt, maim\nand  kill  people,  they  are  the  main  factor  in  corrections\ninstitutions which allow inmates to hurt, maim and kill other\ninmates and staff.\n17.  In  addition  to  the  potential  for  physical  harm,\nweapons  allow  predatory  inmates  an  extra  and  unacceptable\nadvantage  over  reasonable  and  weak  inmates.  Elimination  of\nweapons  in  an  institution  substantially  and  in  some  cases\ncompletely eliminates the potential for forced homosexual rape\nand other forms of extortion.\n18.  It is necessary to have both administrative sanc-\ntions available within an institution and statutory  sanctions\navailable in the criminal statutes.  Because the prosecution of\ncrimes  in  the  criminal  justice  system  tends  to  take  a\nsubstantial period of time, it does not provide as immediate a\n- 5 -\n\ndisincentive to inmates to possess or use weapons as a strong\ninstitutional  or  system-wide  disciplinary  code.  That  is why\nthe potential three-year prison sentence in New Mexico alone is\nnot effective  as a disciplinary  tool.  Institution  officials\nmust have the latitude and flexibility to take immediate action\nwithin  an  institution  to  control  predators  and  use  and\npossession of weapons.\n19.  There  is no  alternative  to  stronger\nsanctions  against  inmates  who  possess  or  use  weapons  in  an\ninstitution.  As long as there are no strong sanctions against\nuse or possession of weapons, inmates will take the chance of\npossessing them and even constant searches or shakedowns of an\ninstitution would never rid the institution of those weapons.\nFurthermore, constant searches or shakedowns of an institution\nare  highly  disruptive  to  the  staff  and  inmate  population  -\nespecially  those who  are not  in possession  of weapons  - and\nwould mean incurring an enormous administrative cost, given the\nlimited resources in any corrections system.\n20.  On January 11, 1985, five days after I assumed my\nposition  as Warden  of  the  Penitentiary  of  the  State  of New\nMexico, my  staff convinced me that a major  confrontation was\npotentially  about to occur in the inmate dining room between\ngroups of inmates, on an ethnically divided basis.  1 therefore\nordered a complete lockdown of the institution and a thorough\nsearch  followed.  Approximately  40  inmate weapons were  found\nand  delivered  to  my  office.  These  were  all  stabbing  type\n- 6 -\n\nweapons  fabricated  from a variety of metal and rigid plastic\nmaterial, any one of which was fully capable of causing bodily\nharm  and  death.  During  the past  five months, the  staff has\nfound approximately 80 such weapons during routine searches of\nthe institution and it is only reasonable to assume that these\nrepresent only a small percentage of the total inmate weapons\nwhich continue to exist within the institution.\n21.  The  Penitentiary  of New Mexico  continues  to  have\nneariyv__200 inmates in actual or effective protective custcdyT)\nwho, as a result of institution and administration  failure to\nprovide  a  totally  protective  environment  for  them,  are\neffectively  denied  the  many  institution  program  benefits\navailable.  These  protective  custody  inmates  are  forced  into\ntheir  situation  as a  result of  inmate predators, gangs, and\nmarauding  behavior, all of which are in direct proportion to\nthe  availability  of  weapons  to  predator  inmates.  At  the\nthese  inmates  cannot  feel  safe  within  their\nenvironment;  they  must  either  go  into  a  protective  custody\nsetting, join a gang  for protection, or pay  stronger  inmates\nfor protection with money, other items of value or homosexual\nfavors.\n22.  The  Penitentiary  of  New  Mexico  is  burdened  with\ninmates  in possession of weapons and has a tragic history of\ninmate violence.  It is my professional opinion that  for the\nPenitentiary  to have  200  inmates  in need  of protection  is a\ndisgrace.  Homosexual  rape, head  bludgeonings  and  stabbings\n- 7 -\n\nwithin the Penitentiary are situations which can be practically\neliminated  to  the degree  that  the  Penitentiary  administration\ncan control inmate predators and gangs, again directly  related\nand proportionate to the availability of inmate weapons within\nthe institution.\n23.  As Warden of the Penitentiary of New Mexico, my top\npriority  is to provide  a safe environment  for inmates  to  live\nwithin and  for  staff to work within.  The Penitentiary  of New\nMe::ico has the necessary^ security  physical planf, stafif, staff\ntraining  )and  in  general  the  ability  to  conts&3r weapons.\n—  ~\"\nHowever, such resources and ability are essentially nullifed in\nthe absence  of adequate  sanctions  for inmates who  possess  and\nuse weapons.  There  is no current  sufficient  and  identifiable\ndeterrent  to  inmates  who  are  engaging  in  weapons  use  and\npossession.\n'\n24.  I  am  confident  that  with  adequate  administrative\nsanctions and prosecution, I can direct the eventual  cleansing\nof the Penitentiary  of New Mexico of  inmate weapons.  As  that\nhighest  priority  is  achieved,  it  will  be  possible  to  move\ntoward  eliminating  the  need  for  protective  custody.  As  the\nadministration and staff of the Penitentiary gain control over\ninmate weapons, it will be possible to eliminate the existence\nof gangs and to more responsibly  insure a safe environment  for\ninmates and staff.\n25.  The elimination  of weapons will  not only  decrease\nthe power of predatory  inmates within  the  institution, but  it\n—  8 —\n\nwill  also  significantly  enhance  the  access  to  the  benefits\nguaranteed  by  this  Consent  Decree  to  persons  in  protective\ncustody and those in the general population whose benefits are\nbeing  curtailed  by  predatory  inmates.  The  only  persons  who\ncould conceivably be disadvantaged  by increased  administrative\nsanctions  and  increased  control  and  elimination  of  weapons\nwould be predatory inmates who are not legitimately entitled to\nthe benefits which they receive as the result of their posses-\nsion and use of weapons.\n26.  In  my  opinion,  any  corrections  professional  with\nrespected credentials in the United States would agree with the\npolicies and opinions which I have set forth in this Affidavit.\n27.  In  my  opinion,  the  relief  sought  in  Defendants'\nMotion to Modify  the Maximum  Security  Policy  Statement  is the\nonly  reasonable, effective way  to accomplish  these goals, for\nthe Penitentiary and all other correctional institutions in New\nMexico.\nSUBSCRIBED  AND  SWORN  TO  BEFORE  ME  this  /0j6«,day of\nJuly, 1985.\nW\nNotary Public  /\nMy Commission Expires:  /6//& I\n- 9 -\n\nPERSONAL HISTORY RESUME\nof\nGEORGE EARL SULLIVAN\nPERSONAL:\nBorn:  June 17, 1932, Kansas City, Kansas.

ONLY\n\nCHALLENGE:  ABORT PROTECTIVE CUSTODY\nWithin the data of the first section of this publication we have evidence of\nthe increasing numbers and testimony of the growing acceptability of Protec-\ntive Custody in our nation's prisons today.  This section is presented in\nobjection to and rejective of such acceptability; recommends such programs be\naborted; gives reasons and warnings on \"Why Abort?\"; and, suggests some\nthoughts and approaches on, \"How To\".\nStandard 2-4220 in the January, 1981 Second Edition of Standards for Adult\nCorrectional Institutions, /I/ reads:\n\"Written policy and procedure provide that admission to the segregation\nunit for purposes of protective custody is made only when there is docu-\nmentation that protective custody is warranted and no reasonable alter-\nnatives are available.  (Essential)\"\nAs this Standard is read again, more slowly and more deliberately, its intent\nbecomes very clear.  With highlighting, the Standard requires that assignment\nto Protective Custody is made \"only when documentation exists that protective\ncustody is warranted and no reasonable alternatives are available.\"  Regret-\ntably, this Standard can be read to as much recognize the growing accept-\nability of Protective Custody as to courageously require that Protective Cus-\ntody be absolutely limited to those very few high publicity cases wherein the\nindividual is clearly at risk by others who would wish to replace him/her on\n\"front page\".  Because the \"Quality of Life\" for inmates assigned to Protec-\ntive Custody is severely diminished, it is hoped in future update that 2-4220\nwill become more courageous and its value increase from (Essential) to\n(Mandatory).\n/!/  Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions, Second\nEdition, January, 1981; American Correctional Association\nin cooperation with the Commission on Accreditation for\nCorrections.\nEXHIBIT \"B\" TO AFFIDAVIT OF GEORGE E.\n\nIn ordering desegregation of publicly-supported  schools, the U.S. Supreme\nCourt held that \"separatism\" and \"'equality\" were mutually exclusive and that\nso-called \"separate-but-equal\" facilities were, in fact, unconstitutional.\nThe paraphrased opinion of our highest court was that, \"even if the physical\nfacilities, service-delivery, and service-support  systems were\niden'tical in every detail - segregated  individuals would be deprived of their\nright to associate freely and safely in the mainstream of community life.\"\nAre the conditions of segregated public schools and segregated categories of\ninmates analogous?  Many correctional  administrators would say, \"No\", and they\nwould be quick to add, \"Protective Custody inmates both need and want the\nspecial protection we provide and we are certainly not guilty of the same sort\nof discrimination identified as being practiced in some schools prior to the\nintervention of the courts - simply because we are responding to a manifest\nneed!\"\nThis fairly potent rejoinder seems to have prima facie validity and usually\nhas the effect of suppressing any further discussion or examination of the\n\"need\".  The \"need\" for a Protective Custody status must, however, be examined\nand correctional  administrators must be willing to consider the extent to\nwhich we ourselves create the \"need\".  Whether by omission or commission, if\nwe allow the quality of life (i.e., life, health and safety) in our institu-\ntions to deteriorate to the point where certain inmates cannot maintain  them-\nselves safely in the general population - are we not generating the \"need\" for\nspecial protection?  Also, to justify Protective Custody on the grounds that\n\"many inmates want or, even, demand such protection\" begs the issue of whether\nor not there is an intrinsic \"need\" for a Protective Custody status in our\ninstitutions.  We are simply stating the obvious when we conclude that p^ople^\nwho live in fear will seek safety.\ni  •  •  •  •  •  --•\nThe  important  question  is,  \"If  all  things  are  truly  equal,  will  substantial\nnumbers of  inmates  voluntarily  elect  to  be segregated  from the mainstream and\nbe housed  in  'separate-but-equaV  facilities?\"\nThis  paper  embodies  the  same constitutional  principles  expressed  by  the  U.S.\nSupreme Court  in  its  desegregation  rulings  and explores  some of  the  adminis-\ntrative  failures  creating  the  \"need\"  for  Protective  Custody  -  as well  as some\n-  3  -\n\nof the sound correctional practices which can help to obviate the \"need\".\nANATOMY OF TYPICAL PROTECTIVE CUSTODY PLACEMENTS\nCase 1\nJohn Smith, age 32, was received at the institution on June 1, 1982.  He\nwas convicted on charges of Rape and Sodomy in a highly publicized case\ninvolving a young mother in a local community.  He received a sentence of\n10 years.\nShortly after arriving at the institution, Smith had coffee spilled down\nhis back in the Dining Room.and has, on two occasions, had lighted ciga-\nrettes thrown through the bars of his cell onto his bedding.\nOn June 28, Smith approached the Watch Cornnander and complained of not\nbeing allowed a seat in the TV room, and added that his cell partner had\ntold him to \"get a cell change - or else.\"  After a conference between the\nWatch Commander and the Assistant Warden of Security, Smith signed a vol-\nuntary commitment form and, on July 2, was transferred to the Adminis-\ntrative Segregation Wing as a Protective Custody placement.\nCase 2\nRaymond Brown, age 27, was received at the institution on May 30, 1982.\nHe had been charged with Murder and Armed Robbery, but the Murder charge\nwas dismissed when he agreed to testify against his \"crime-partner\" - who\nwas received at the same institution two months prior to the arrival of\nBrown.\nThe Deputy who delivered Brown to the Institution told staff in Receiving\nand Release that there had been \"a lot of talk\" among inmates at the\nCounty Jail that Brown's co-defendent had put out a contract and that\nBrown \"wouldn't last a week in the joint.\"\n- .4 -\n\nBrown was placed  in  a one-man cell  on the  day  he arrived  and was  kept\nunder  close  staff  surveillance  during  the  ten-day  Inmate  Orientation\nperiod.  Upon completion  of  orientation,  he agreed with  the  Security Man-\nager  that  he \"had  better  lock  up\"  and was placed  in  Protective  Custody on\nJune  17, 1982.\nCase 3\nJoseph White had been in the institution for six months when he was\ngranted a request for a cell change on the grounds that he and his cell\npartner \"couldn't get along together.\"  Shortly after moving to a new\ncell, White's former cell partner was found to be in possession of dan-\ngerous contraband and was.placed in the Segregation Unit pending a Disci-\nplinary Hearing.\nAt the hearing it was revealed that the information regarding the dan-\ngerous contraband was received from a \"reliable informant\".\nWhite told his Work Supervisor that he had had a \"jacket put on him\" and\nwas being threatened by his former cell partner's friends.  After a dis-\ncussion between the Work Supervisor arid the Deputy Warden, White was\n\"voluntarily\" placed in Protective Custody.\nCase 4\nKeith Jones, age 19, was received at the Institution on August 4, 1982, .\nwith a 3 year sentence for Burglary.  Jones repeatedly complained to the\nPrison Chaplain that he was being subjected to lewd comments and homo-\nsexual advances.  After being contacted by Jones' mother, who insisted her\nson \"needed protection\", the Chaplain approached the Warden and it was\nagreed that Jones could \"sign himself\" into Protective Custody.\n\"These four cases certainly do not reflect the full spectrum of reasons why\ninmates end up on Protective Custody, and the administrative processes which\n- 5 -\n\nprecede placement in \"special protection\" will certainly differ markedly from\ninstitution to institution.  These four cases, however, have certain denomi-\nnators in common with the vast majority of all Protective Custody placements,\ni.e., inmates who perceive a threat to their personal safety and institution\nstaff who agree - and, with total agreement between the \"keepers\" and the\n\"kept\" regarding the nature of the problem, who can possibly question the\nnecessity of the placements?  In fact, many reasonable and prudent \"outsiders\"\nwould read file documents no more detailed than the skeletal case summaries\nlisted above and agree that the placements were administratively sound and\nlegally justified.\nThe same reasonable and prudent \"outside\" observers would not, in all prob-\nability,' suggest any parallel between the four hypothetical placements and the\nracially segregated schools of the pre-19601s era - and, in'response to such a\ncharge, might advance the argument, \"The four inmates perceived a threat to\ntheir safety and obviously preferred the security and community of interest\nafforded by Protective Custody.\"  We have, then, an unassailable raison d'etre\nfor Protective Segregation!\nOr, do we?\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of our public schools,\nthe proponents of continued separation of the races advanced a similar argu-\nment.  They said, \"The minorities would be subjected to racial slurs and other\nkinds of abuse in integrated schools, and we really have their best interests\nin mind in maintaining  separate-but-equal facilities.  Besides, they would\nrather be \"with their own kind.\"\nAs evidence of the validity of their argument, the segregationists displayed\nthe results of a number of informal polls conducted among minority students\nwhich showed, rather convincingly, that large numbers of affected  individuals\ndid, indeed, voice a desire to continue with the status quo!\nThe preceeding report on Protective Custody study reveals seventy-nine  (79)\n'percent of the PC inmates admitted to self-placement.  Nearly three-quarters\nof the inmate sample would be happy to stay in PC until their sentence was\n- 6 -\n\ncompleted.  When asked what would have to change before they would request to\nbe returned to general population, answers included the following:\n- Would not go - regardless,\n- Certain inmate(s) must be gone,\n- Better control of racial tensions,\n- Better control of gangs.\nThese \"reasons\" to continue status quo are readily translatable into identical\narguments/\"reasons\" of the Segregationists' minority study findings.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, however, was unimpressed with both the argument of the\nsegregationists and the informally collected supporting data.  The Court held\nthat it was reasonable that minority students would not relish the expection\nof racial slurs and physical abuse, but they also held that the resolution to\ntheir fears could not be continued isolation from the mainstream of American\nlife.  The Court ordered desegregation - with equal protection for all!\nIn order to lend greater definition to the analogous nature of \"separate-.but-\nequal\" educational facilities in the conmunity and \"separate-but-equal\" living\narrangements in correctional  institutions, it might be enlightening to make a\nnot-too-speculative examination of the environment within which our four hypo-\nthetical Protective Custody cases might have arisen.\nIn searching for a parallel between the concerns of the racial minorities that\nthey would be subjected to verbal abuse in integrated schools and the1concerns\nof inmates who seek asylum in Protective Custody, we might consider the pejor-\native labels that are used by staff in reference to \"special protection\"\ninmates.  How many institutional staff members, for example, would read the\nfour hypothetical cases of Protective Custody placement and automatically reg-\nister, mentally or verbally, that:  \"Smith is a rapo; Brown is a rat; White is\na snitch; Jones is a knick-knack\"?\nWhat substantive difference is there between these labels and racial or ethnic\n'slurs?  How many times does an individual hear these demeaning and dehuman-\nizing terms before deciding to seek a \"community of interest\" with \"his own\n- 7 -\n\nkind\".  More importantly, perhaps, is the question, \"How many times does a\nstaff member hear these terms before reaching the point of relating to a label\nrather than attempting to interact with the human being who has been so\nlabeled?\"\nWhile it may be rare that an institution staff member physically abuses an\ninmate because of his criminal history or institutional behavior patterns, how\noften do staff, wittingly or unwittingly, declare \"open season\" on particular\ninmates by announcements such as \"Rapo Smith had coffee thrown on him.\",\n\"White is in a world of hurt because he snitched-off his cell partner.\", \"No,\nI don't mean Joe Jones.  It was queer Jones.\"?\nTo what extent do we create the \"need\" for Protective Custody through the\nmedium-of the self-fulfilling prophecy?  How many times have we heard staff •\npredict, in the presence of inmates, that, \"We are going to have trouble with\nWebster's crime partner when he gets here.  He testified against Webster and\nwas able to cop a plea.  His name is Brown - and a lot of people are waiting\nfor him.\"?\nIn many more cases than we would ever admit, Protective Custody assignment is\nmade more as a result of attitudes, staff and inmates, than of actual fear of\ndanger or for physical safety.  Staff training mav well be thp key tn imme-\ndiate, significant reduction or abortion of Protective Custody.  There are\nample reasons to eliminate Protective Custody from staff perspective, as\nrevealed by the preceeding study data.  (Thirty-eight (38) percent of the Cor-\nrectional Officers consider duty in Protective Custody Units to be undesir-\nable.)  With more specific training to aid staff in appreciating their own\ncontribution to the problem they will surely modify attitudes and unthinking\n\"chatter-talk\".  Retraining should include instruction to staff to be \"very\naggressive\" in coming to the defense of those being harrassed or oppressed,\neven if only motivated by knowing to do so precludes Protective Custody.\nRather than dwell, however, on the overt and covert ways in which we make our\nown segregated beds, we may better serve our profession by examining the cost-\n•effectiveness of Protective Custody and, if we conclude that the costs exceed\nthe benefit, sketch some other affirmative steps we can all take in an effort\n- 8 -\n\nto desegregate our institutions.\nCOSTS OF PROTECTIVE CUSTODY\nIn these critical days of institution overcrowding, skyrocketing costs, and\nhuge budget deficits - both correctional  administrators and State Legislatures\nare carefully scrutinizing institution programs in an effort to determine\nwhere corners can be cut and dollar savings realized.  In fact, many cor-\nrectional systems are re-examining their basic mission and, because of the\nperceived high costs of rehabilitative programs, are beginning to look more\nfavorably at the so-called \"Just Desserts\" models of incarceration, i.e., feed\nthem, clothe them, and keep them busy for the length of their stay - but cut\nout all the educational and vocational frills.\nObviously, any shift to a \"punishment\" model from the rehabilitative model\nwould be antithetical to the fine professional standards we have adopted under\nthe auspices of ACA - but it is understandable that fiscal constraints might\ncause an erosion of humanistic principles in institution management.  Systems\nthroughout the United States are computing the man-hour and man-day costs of\nproviding academic and vocational training and are beginning to ask the ques-\ntion, \"Is it worth it?\"\nMissing, however, from the cost-benefit analyses being conducted on a nation-\nwide scale is a study of the varying costs of different levels of security\nsupervision in the same facility.  It simply is not true that \"securtUy opera-\ntions/manpower\" are so essential  as to be \"untouchable\".  Institution Adminis-\ntrators should as carefully scrutinize \"security operations/manpower\" as they\ndo other operations/manpower  budgets.  Were this done, the belt-tightening\nadministrators and legislators might conclude that our \"separate-but-equal\"\nfacilities constitute the most expensive programs we operate!\nConsider the following example of a maximum security penitentiary located on\nthe West Coast.  This 1000-bed facility operates a 48-bed Administrative Seg-\nregation Unit in addition to a 48-bed Disciplinary Detention Unit.  (While\nmost segregation units throughout the country function as both Administrative\n- 9 -\n\nSegregation and Disciplinary Segregation facilities - some have found it\ndesirable or necessary to separate the two categories of confinement.  Also,\nthose institutions which operate separate facilities for Administrative Seg-\nregation and Disciplinary Segregation have learned that the costs of super-\nvision in the two types of segregation are almost identical.)\nA.  Administrative Segregation (48 inmates)\n1.  Staffing =  (1) Sergeant @  $  1,800 per month\n(1)  Corporal  @  $  1,600  per  month\n(14)  Officers  @  $  1,450  each  per  rconth\nBase  salaries  =  S 23,700  per  T.onth\nOPE* @ 31%  =  $  7,347 per month\n' Total Supervision = $ 31,047 per month\n$372,564 per annum\n*0ther Personnel Expenses.\n2.  Per Capita Costs - Based on only staff costs, and assuming a\nfull complement of 48 inmates in Administrative Segregation, the\ncost per man year of inmate supervision is $7,762.\nB.  General Population Housing Unit (150 inmates)\n1.  Staffing = (1) Sergeant @  $  1,800 per month\n(6) Officers @  $  1,450 each per month\nBase salaries =  $ io,5OO per month\nOPE 9 31%  =  $  3,255 per month\nTotal Supervision = $ 13,755 per month\n$165,060 per annum\n2.  Per Capita Costs - Based on only staff costs, and assuming a\nfull complement of 150 inmates in the General Population Housing\nUnit, the cost per man year of inmate supervision is $1,100.\nThe above cost comparision is, admittedly, superficial - but, if it errs, it\nerrs on the side of conservatism.  Significantly higher staffing ratios in\n- 10 -\n\nAdministrative  Segregation,  including  Protective  Custody,  are  necessary  to  a\n\"full  service\"  lockup  as  practically  all  inmate  services  need  almost  to  be\nhand-carried  and  security  supervision  has  to  be  intensive.  Not  included  in\nthese  costs  of  supervising  inmates  in  Administrative  Segregation  are  the\nrather  substantial  overtime  costs  involved  in  providing  additional  hours  of\nspecialized  in-service  training  each  year  to  the  staff  assigned  to  the Admin-\nistrative  Segregation  Unit,  the  indirect  costs  of  providing  additional  super-\nvision  during  special  line  movements,  etc.\nAlso,  the  base-salary  levels  and  the  costs  of  Other  Personnel  Expenses  (e.g.,\nvacation,  sick  leave,  retirement  contributions,  employer-paid  insurance,  etc.)\nwill  differ  somewhat  from  correctional  system  to  correctional  system.  It  is\nfelt,  however,  that  the  ratio  of  costs  will  not  differ  radically  -  and  that\nratio-is  a dramatic  7 to  1!  For  every  dollar  spent  on the  day-to-day  super-\nvision  of  an  inmate  in  the  general  institution  population,  seven  dollars  would\nbe  spent  on the  same  inmate  in  Protective  Custody.  The cost  increase  per  man-\nyear  of  supervision  is  an  astronomical  $6,661 for  each  inmate  housed  in  the\n\"separate-but-equal\"  facility!\nPerhaps  some administrators  in  the  more  generously  endowed  systems  might\nobserve  that  it  is  academic  to  compute  cost  differences  in  the  two types  of\nsupervision,  since  the  budget  appropriation  is  based  on  the  average  cost  of\nsupervision  of  all  inmates  housed  in  the  institution.  Even  those  adminis-\ntrators  must,  however,  consider  the  enormous  \"opportunity  costs\"  involved  in\noperating  a Protective  Custody  program,  i.e.,  \"How might  these  dollar\nresources  be  applied  to  the  total  institution  environment,- if  they  were  not\nconsumed  in  the  operation  of  segregated  housing?  How much  staff  training,\neducation,  vocational  training,  psychological  counseling,  etc.,  would  the\ntotal  difference  of  $319,728  buy  in  a  1000-bed  institution  each  year?\"\nThis  dollar  cost  focus,  i.e..,  the  added monetary  costs  of  supervising  inmates\nin  Protective  Custody,  may be the  least  of  all  of  the  costs  which  result  from\nthe  operation  of  such  a program.  The truly  significant  costs  of  Protective\nCustody may well  be  the  social  and  emotional  debilitation  suffered  by  inmates\n•who  are  segregated  from  the  general  institution  population.  In  terms  of\nsocial  status,  the  incarcerated  felon  ranks  fairly  low  in  our  country  and,  in\n-  11  -\n\nthe institutional social hierarchy, the Protective Custody inmate is at the\nvery bottom!  Consider the impact on self-esteem and personal motivation of\nbeing unable to associate freely with a population of social outcasts!\nAll inmates are keenly aware of the fact that they have forfeited their free-\ndom as the result of a felony conviction, but most are able to come to terms\nwith, or rationalize, both the crimes and the fact of incarceration - and they\nquickly establish themselves much in the same manner in which they established\nthemselves in the free comnunity.  They cultivate friends, find jobs, partici-\npate in sports and other leisure-time activities, attend classes.  They are\nable to make choices and, eventually, find a reasonably acceptable niche.  In\na Maslovian sense, most of their physiological, security, and affiliation\nneeds are fairly well met and they are in a position to cultivate their self-\nesteem.\nNot so with Protective Custody inmates!\nIn accepting Protective Custody as a program option, both, institution staff\nand the inmate(s) are faced with a critical choice, and, once having made a\ndecision in favor of Protective Custody placement, most other possible options\nare forever negated.  The finality of Protective Custody recalls the cliched\nexpression, \"There is no such thing as being a little bit pregnant.\"  In a\nvery real sense, there is no such thing as 'partial' or 'short-term' Protec-\ntive Custody.  Like pregnancy, Protective Custody for an inmate ends only with\ndeliverance from the system, i.e., Parole or Discharge.  Even  institutional\ntransfer has proved to be unreliable in terminating the condition - Because\nthe \"PC Jacket\" will inevitably follow the inmate across jurisdictional  lines\nand, while some staff may not be aware of the \"jacket\", it is as obvious to\nother inmates as a maternity smock.\nIn the light of Maslow's thesis, however, one could contend that, once the\ninmate's safety needs are met through the medium of Protective Custody - the\npre-potency of that need is dissipated and the inmate is liberated to pursue\nego satisfaction in a protected environment.  This might be true if Protective\n'Custody did, in fact, erase the threat to safety.  Quite to the contrary, how-\never, Protective Custody formalizes, magnifies, and broadcasts the threat.\n-.12 -\n\nThe Protective Custody inmate is arrested on the safety-security rung of\nMasiow's ladder and will live out his period of incarceration in constant\nfear, supported by recent acts perpetrated on Protective Custody inmates\nduring a prison riot.  =\nThe Protective Custody inmate is bombarded daily with a constant series of\nreminders of where he is situated on the \"needs\" ladder.  Every meal served\nfrom a hotcart in the Protective Custody Unit, every visit in the Security\nVisiting Room, every staff escort to a call out, every special  line movement to\nCanteen or Clothing Exchange, every period of segregated recreation, serve to\nunderscore the pre-potency of his need for special protection.  Having elected\nto place himself in the Protective Custody of institution staff, the inmate\nhad re-entered a metaphorical womb and will, for the duration of his life in\nthe system, be dependent on staff for his survival.\nIt is precisely in the parent-child relationship engendered by Protective Cus-\ntody that we find the seeds of the management problems encountered by Protec-\ntive Custody staff.  Some of the Protective Custody placements relate to staff\nas passive children and are typically termed \"good inmates\".  Most, however,\nrecognize the extent of their self-induced dependency plus their inability to\nemancipate themselves, and their behavior is characteristic of angry, destruc-\ntive, demanding children. ^UnfortunateIj^jthese modes of behavior tend to\nreinforce among correctional  administrators  and institution staff the felt\n\"need\" for the very same protective segregation which generates the seeming\ninfantile response.  It certainly seems reasonable that we would segregate\ninmates who are not only \"snitches\" - but who also are volatile, nuisances,\nmanic-depressive, suicidal, destructive, etc.\nThe preceeding report on Protective Custody study reveals fully seventy-five\n(75) percent of the staff reported PC inmates presented problems not common to\nAdministrative Segregation or Disciplinary Detention inmates, such as:  \"Are\nusually more harrassing, demanding\",  \"Require inordinate amount of staff\ntime\", and \"Feeding, exercise, visits, etc., are more complicated\".  Staff\nlisted some of the worst things about working the PC unit as:  \"Excessive  com-\n'plaining/demanding\", \"verbal abuse from inmates\", \"must baby-sit inmates\", and\n\"low quality of inmates\".\n- 13 -\n\nWhile the human costs inherent  in Protective Custody defy the kinds of exact\nmeasurement we can apply to staff salaries, we cannot dismiss at least the\npotential for long term or, even, permanent, socio-psychological  impairment.\nAs one Protective Custody inmate remarked, \"If going to prison is like being\nsent to hell, being in Protective Custody is like living in the basement of\nhell.\"\nBack to Standard 2-4220; even the most elementary of research effort  in any\ninstitution will surely reveal significant financial savings in maintaining\nfull compliance with 2-4220, when compared to maintaining full compliance with\nthe other \"Essential\" and \"Mandatory\" Standards requiring  \"equal-if-separate\"\nprograms for Protective Custody inmates.  The costs in the human condition and\nhuman dignity are immeasurable and probably for life.\nPointing to the costs of Protective Custody, both dollar costs and human\ncosts, is much  like bemoaning the high cost of energy.  Unless we can prevent,\neliminate, or reduce the \"need\" - it costs what it costs!  We believe there\nare mechanisms which, if properly designed and implemented, can assist in the\neradication of the^ \"need\" - but these mechanisms will be effective only if\npredicated on total and sincere organizational  commitment.\nPREMISES\nBefore expecting any organization to commit  itself fully to a course of\naction, it is necessary that the members of the organization understand and\naccept the premises on which the course of action is based.  While the fol-\nlowing propositions are based largely on site visits and program audits con-\nducted throughout the United States, it would be dishonest to suggest that the\nprimary purpose of the aforementioned visits and audits was to collect data\nrelating specifically to the necessity and efficacy of Protective Custody pro-\ngrams.  It would be equally dishonest not to admit that part of what follows\nis based rather more on the intuitive interpretation of events, and profes-\nsional conclusions based on years of institutional experience, than on a sys-\ntematic analysjs-of data.—IMs_djsclaimer_ is not presented  as an apology for\ndeficiencies  in research methodology but as a lament!\n- 14 -\n\nThe fact  is  that  scant  attention  has  been given  to  this  burgeoning  and expen-\nsive  program  in  our  institutions.  While  dollar  costs  can be computed  easily,\nthere  has  not  been, to  our  knowledge,  a single  resr?nn<:ihip  fnTinq.iip  study  nf\nformer  Protective  Custody  inmates^ now released,  in  an attempt  to  game  the\npossible  long-range  effects  of  prolonged  stays  in  special  protection.  So,  in\nthe  absence of  any carefully  constructed  hypothesis  regarding  \"delayed  shock\nsyndrome\"  traceable  to  Protective  Custody  experience,  conjecture  and  inference\nmust  suffice  until  our  profession  is  able  to  conduct  a sound and  defensible\nexamination  of  this  particular  form  of  segregation  in  our  institutions.\nPremises\n1.  Both the number of institutions which operate Protective Custody pro-\ngrams and the percentage of inmates placed in Protective Custody are\nincreasing at a rate faster than the increase in total numbers of new\ncommitments.\n2.  Most institutions do not budget separately for the operation of Pro-\ntective Custody programs and, consequently, are not completely aware\nof the extremely high costs involved.\n3.  Few institutions consider the \"opportunity\" costs related to Pro-\ntective Custody or seriously examine the extent to which the\nresources so committed might be alternatively applied to an increase\nin general security or \"quality of life\" programs to reduce the per-\nceived need for special protection.\n4.  Many Protective Custody programs serve operationally as informal\nmechanisms for affecting racial-ethnic segregation, or escape hatches\nfor the weak, timid^emcitionally troubled and/or socially unskilled.\n5.  While \"treatment\" program staff are frequently involved in the review\nof recommendations for reduction in custody supervision, temporary\nleaves, work assignments, meritorious pay, etc., - decisions\nregarding Protective Custody are usually exclusively within the pur-\nview of security staff, usually without dear   formal policy\nT\nguidelines.\n- 15 -\n\n6.  Because of similarities in socio-economic backgrounds, security staff\noften share values in common with the general inmate population -\nrelative to types of crimes, sexual preference, interpersonal codes,\nracial equality, etc.\n7.  There is rarely any effort to involve the outside support systems of\ninmates when exploring the possible necessity of a Protective Custody\nplacement.\n8.  Through a claim of fear of possible legal liability as a consequence\nof not providing special protection, little effort is made to dis-\nsuade inmates from entering Protective Custody.\n9.  Few institutions have specific policies or procedures which govern\nthe screening and processing of requests for Protective Custody.\n10.  Many correctional administrators have never carefully assessed the\npros and cons of Protective Custody, but have come to simply accept\nit as a standard ingredient in institutional management.\nIf, after pondering the above premises, the correctional system concludes that\nat least some of them have even partial validity - the important question be-\ncomes, \"What, if anything, do we want to do about it?\"\nIn those cases where the response to the above question is a solid decision to\navoid, eliminate, or reduce the need for Protective Custody - it then becomes\nof paramount importance to generate total organizational commitment prior to\ndesigning and implementing an organization-wide_strategy to achjeye the\ndesired results.\nORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT\nThe first step in engendering broad-based support for avoiding, eliminating,\nor reducing the need for Protective Custody is to communicate the Executive\nManagement position that \"Protective Custody is costly, antithetical to sound\n- 16 -\n\ncorrectional practice, and poor stewardship over public funds - and that every\nreasonable means will be employed to engineer a total-institution-safe-envi-  >\nronment to preclude the perceived need for Protective Custody\".\nThis management position is best communicated via an official Policy which is\nwidely disseminated, and subsequently discussed during staff meetings involv-\ning all levels and categories of institution staff.  Meetings to discuss the\nPolicy should be conducted by individuals who subscribe to the Executive Man-\nagement position, and should include data relating to both direct dollar costs\nand \"opportunity\" costs.  While constructively critical feedback should be\naccepted at these meetings, care should be taken to avoid cornnunieating an\nunderstanding that the management position is tentative or subject to staff\nveto.  Also, it should be stressed that specific strategies and procedural\nsteps to translate management policy into operational reality have not been\nadopted and that all staff and selected groups of inmates will be given the\nopportunity to provide input into the design of the ultimate blueprint.\nDuring staff discussions of the Executive Management position in opposition to\nthe continued promiscuous use of Protective Custody as a quick and easy  .\nsolution to ad hoc problems, one can anticipate many of the same arguments\nwhich were mounted in opposition to the integration of public schools -\nincluding, finally, the position, \"If it's going to be forced on us, there's\nnot much we can do about it, but we should consider starting the new program\nwith people just coming into the system and let those who are already in Pro-\ntective Custody finish out their terms in Administrative Segregation.\"  This\ncompromise position represented a last-ditch effort on the part of earlier\nproponents of public school segregation to maintain at least a semblance of a\ntraditional separation of the races - but it fell on deaf ears with members of\nthe U.S. Supreme Court.  Rightly so!\nWhen presented as a viable strategy for the gradual reduction of the use of\nProtective Custody, however, it might be viewed as the \"light at the end of\nthe tunnel\" - and, in some institutions might constitute the only realistic\nbridge from entrenched Protective Segregation to an enhanced quality of life\n-which offers the maximum feasible protection for all inmates on an equal basis.\n- 17 -\n\nThese suggestions on steps a correctional system might take in generating a\nclimate of acceptance for a policy position which discourages Protective Cus-\ntody are certainly elementary and somewhat pedestrian, but they are repeated\nhere to lend emphasis to the necessity of \"campaigning for commitment\" in\nadvance of effecting a major change in the way we conduct our business.  The\nsuggestions also highlight, hopefully, the absolute necessity of a firm and\nunequivocal position on the part of Top Management, if the change is to mate-\nrialize in a planned and orderly manner.\nPLANNING FOR INTEGRATION\nHaving announced Executive Management's firm policy position on Protective\nCustody, and, having conducted an intensive campaign to gain sufficient accep-\ntance for the policy position, a rationally designed plan to achieve the\ndesired results must be developed.  To be effective, the plan must be compre-\nhensive and will, necessarily, involve a cross-section of planners drawn from\nall levels of all institutional programs.  Also, it must be recognized and\naccepted that the planning process will be time-consuming, expensive, and\nfraught with logistical problems, inmate and staff resistance.  There is no\nsubstitute, however, for a carefully engineered plan if the result is to be\ncost-effective, legally defensible, and compatible with sound rehabilitative\nprogramming.\nAs a minimum, the planning process should address the following critical ele-\nments:  \"  ~*\n1.  Standards;\n2.  Deviation Testing;\n3.  Constraints Assessment;\n4.  Resource Identification;\n5.  Objective Setting;\n6.  Selection of Preferred Strategy;\n7.  Organizing for Implementation;\n8.  Implementing, Coordinating;\n9.  Monitoring, Evaluating.\n- 18 -\n\nSince most of the above elements are fairly standard  ingredients in any plan-\nning process, they need no amplification here.  The application of Standards\nto the planning process, however, deserves special attention for at least four\nreasons:\n1.  Most correctional professionals in the U.S. are already attuned to\nthe nature and use of ACA Standards in the Accreditation process;\n2.  Positive transfer from the concepts of familiar ACA Standards to\noper- ational areas not addressed by ACA Standards can be effected\nwith relative harmony;\n3.  Broad ACA-type Standards which echo the management policy position\nregarding Protective Custody can easily be divided into specific sub-\nsidiary Standards to use as templates to measure the extent of cur-\nrent deviation from the ultimate condition envisioned by the Policy;\n4.  It is extremely difficult to assess the efficacy of program objec-\ntives without some index of the extent to which such objectives will\nsteer the organization  in the direction of a desired result, except\nas may be defined by nationally accepted Standards.\nA reasonable approach to the drafting of a mini \"Standards Manual\" to begin\nintegration planning might be to rewrite ACA Standard 2-4220 as an umbrella\nStandard from which all others will flow.  As adopted and published  in the\nSecond Edition of Standards for Adult Correctional  Institutions, 2-4220 stipu-\nlates that Protective Custody be used \"only when no reasonable  alternatives\nare availablej' - but the Standard sets forth no requirement that there be\nwritten plans for the management of potential Protective Custody inmates in\nthe general population.  Despite the fact that 2-4220 does not address the\nrunaway use of Protective Custody in an aggressive manner, it is the only\nStandard which even approaches a proscription.  So, by combining the likely\nintent of 2-4220 with the unequivocal  language of 2-4210, the system  seeking\nintegration could launch its planning effort with an all-encompassing  Standard\nsimilar to the following:\n- 19 -\n\nSTANDARD:\nThere are written plans which detail alternatives to Pro-\ntective Segregation and which include specific procedures\n/ for ensuring:  early identification of Inmates who may\n\\s  require enhanced protection; timely intervention in special\n.management situations and the development of individually\nv  tailored staff/ coirniunity/inmate support systems;\"qualified\nand professionally committed  staff supervision of vulner-\nable and/or threatened inmates; specialized new employe\norientation and ongoing in-service training focusing on the\nsupervision of special management inmates; appropriate\nremedial action and/or disciplinary action in those situ-\nations where inmates or staff aggravate the possible need\nfor special protection.  These plans are made available to\nall personnel, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n(Mandatory)\nDiscussion:  At a minimum, plans should reflect input by\nPersonnel and Staff Training Officers, Records Office,\nCounselors, Inmate Admission and Orientation staff, Assign-\nment Officer, Institution Security staff, Recreation staff,\nDisciplinary Hearings Officer, and Investigation staff.\nAlternatives should include a process for determining the\nfeasibility and cost-effectiveness of inter-institutional\n\\s  transfer.  Intervention strategies should include the effi-\ncacy of support systems for vulnerable inmates made up of\nsome combination of:  counseling staff; security staff;\ninmate clubs; unaffiliated  inmates; work supervisors;\nfamily members.  Staff selection criteria should include\nmechanisms for surfacing applicants' biases regarding\ncrime-types, aberrant behavior, and racial-ethnic groups.\nNew Employe Orientation and In-Service Training should\nspecifically address the essential supportive role of all\nstaff who interact with special management  inmates.  Col-\nlective Bargaining Agreements should include an \"adminis-\nytrative override\" which would allow management to challenge\nf'a  job bid by an individual who is known to be ineffective\nin working with special management  inmates.  Crew-kit  ~x\ncards, locator files, assignment rosters, and other\nrecords/files/identification  cards accessible to any\ninmates do not include information regarding crime of com-\nmitment or criminal history; inmritP'i fira nnt; atinijnnd to\nthe £exDxds_D£fice or to any tasks outside the Records\nOffice which would make them privy to information regarding\nother inmates; records show that remedial and/or disci-\nplinary action is taken whenever a staff member divulges\ninformation regarding an inmate's personal or criminal his-\ntory; records demonstrate effort to prosecute cases of\nfelonious and/or serious threats to the safety of special\nmanagement inmates.\nThe above Standard might suffice as a tentative umbrella Standard to enable\n- 20 -\n\nProgram Managers, Staff Assistants, and others involved  in the planning pro-\ncess to begin the critically important task of formulating operational  Stan-\ndards governing  \"equal protection\" for all inmates in every  institutional\narena.  A Standard similar to the foregoing could be incorporated  into the\nofficial Policy which sets forth Top Management's position vis-a-vis actual or\npotential special management inmates.\nDuring this important first step in the planning process, it is essential that\nthe Executive Management Team carefully review all operational  Standards for-\nmulated by subordinate managers and staff assistants to ensure that subsidiary\nStandards are vertically consistent with the primary (i.e., \"umbrella\") Stan-\ndard.\nA Standard proposed by the staff supervisor of Inmate Clubs which stipulates,\nfor example:  \"Club constitutions (charters, by-laws) contain a provision that\ninmates will not be barred from membership on the basis of race, ethnic back-\nground, criminal history, or sexual preference - except by a majority vote of\nthe club membership\" would be rejected because it violates the basic principle\nof \"equal opportunity - equal protection\" inherent in the umbrella  Standard.\nOn the other hand, a Standard which allows for the \"dissolution of any Club\nwhich is found to be discriminating  against inmate applicants on the basis of\nany of the above grounds\" - might be deemed acceptable.\nA fairly common tendency on the part of planners  is to generate an inadequate\nnumber of general Standards.  While there is no magical number of operational\nStandards relating the desired state of \"equal opportunity and equal protec-\ntion in an integrated environment\", there should be a sufficient number of\ndetailed Standards to allow the planners to conduct a responsible  self-audit\nand determine the precise degree of current deviation from the desired state.\nOnly in this way can constraints be realistically assessed and resources\naccurately forecasted preparatory to the important step of setting  objectives\n- the achievement of which would close, or narrow, the measured gap between\n\"what is\" and \"what should be\".  Also, a comprehensive compendium of explicit\noperational  Standards will later serve as an excellent blueprint for the on-\ngoing monitoring and subsequent evaluation of the integration  strategies.\n- 21 -\n\nFollowing  is a brief sample of operational Standards which might be developed\nby institution Program Managers and Staff Assistants.  As previously indi-\ncated, all such Standards would be reviewed by the Executive Managment Team\nfor both consistency with the umbrella Standard and acceptability in the par-\nticular institutional environment.  Additionally, the Standards should be\ncategorized  according to program applicability - in the same manner as the ACA\nManual of Standards for Adult Correctional  Institutions.\n1.  Except in cases of felonies or major threats to institution  security,\nlife, health, or safety - staff do not solicit, record, or officially\napply information supplied by inmate informants.\n2.  Out-of-character rules infractions which might indicate that the vio-\nlators are deliberately seeking the protection of Disciplinary Deten-\ntion are immediately referred to the Institution  Investigator.\n3.  Depredations against special management  inmates are reported to the\nState Police for investigation, and prosecuted  in all instances where\nthe Prosecuting Attorney deems the evidence to be sufficient.  (This\nmay well require firming-up working relationships with associates in\nPolice Agencies and Prosecutors Offices.)\n4.  Counselors know the identity-of actual and potential special manage-\nment inmates on their caseloads and interview each such inmate no\nless often than twice monthly.\n5.  Whenever the percentages of racial-ethnic minorities, mentally\nlimited, and/or inmates in vulnerable crime categories in Adminis-\ntrative Segregation or Disciplinary Detention exceed their distribu-\ntion in the general institution population, an investigation  is con-\nducted and a report of findings is submitted to the Executive Manage-\nment Team.\n6.  Staff recruiting announcements, selection examinations, Position\nDescriptions, Codes of Ethics, etc., speak specifically to the\n\"condition of employment\" of relating to special management  inmates -\n- 22 -\n\nand, also, the consequences of breaches of the confidentiality of\n\"protected\" information.\n7.  Employe Performance Appraisals and Promotional Merit Ratings contain\nan index of staff ability to interact effectively with, and provide\nprotective supervision over, special management inmates.\n8.  Actual and potential special management inmates are not assigned to\nwork crews which are not under constant supervision.\nA review of the above operational Standards should highlight the necessity of\ndeveloping a wide array of specific operational Standards as the critical\nfirst step in the process of total organizational planning to avoid, elimi-\nnate, or reduce the need for Protective Custody.\nLiability:  In numerous discussions over the past few years with correctional\nadministrators, the evident merit of doing away with Protective Custody units\nand programs has been readily accepted.  However, all such discussions have\nended with a lament over 1-i-a-b-i-l-i-t-y.  Statements of genuine concern\nover the perceived extremely high risk of agency and even personal liability,\nseem to be dictating management policy.\nAs such discussions concerning Protective Custody with correctional managers\nhave closed, so should this paper close - lamenting \"fear of 1-i-a-b-i-l-\ni-t-y\".  Are correctional facility managers really afraid of being sued?  Are\nthey really afraid of losing a suit?  Correctional administrators are* continu-\nously being sued by inmates for every conceivable reason; seme suits are lost\nand. the inmate wins a change and sometimes \"damages\".  Being sued now-a-days\nis as much a part of a correctional managers business as is providing clothes\nand toothpaste to inmates.  Thus, this writing argues that correctional man-\nagers are not truly fearful of being sued but, instead, provide expressions of\nsuch concerns more because of their acceptability.  No one likes being sued;\nmany fear it, and thus it is an endorseable rationale for Protective Custody.\nIt is very difficult to admit that Protective Custody mushroomed before our\n\"eyes before we realized it and that now we feel trapped by all it entails.\nRather than \"fear law suit and liability\", correctional administrators simply\n- 23 -\n\nneed to  grapple  with  the  issues.  Those who manage America's  prisons  face\nmajor  challenges  every  day;  they  have  \"more than  they  can  say Grace  over\".\nMajor  challenges  are  their  \"world  of  work\".  The challenge  to  Abort  Protective\nCustody  is  simply  another  they  need to  \"take  on\".\nA correctional  manager's  \"liability-risk\"  in  shooting  an escaping  inmate  is\njust  as real  and high  as  are  those  involved  in  \"failure  to  protect\".  The\nliability-risk  for  shooting  an escaping  inmate  has  been  confronted  by estab-\nlishing  defensibility  through  well-developed  laws,  rules,  policies,  pro-\ncedures,  post-orders  and staff  training  programs.  Going  to  Court  in  the\naftermath  of  a shooting  is  not  feared,  as professional,  responsible  defense  is\nwell  established.  Weapons  have  not  been removed from  gun-walks  or  towers\nbecause of  fear  of  being  sued,  yet  such suits  almost  invariably  follow  weapons\nuse.  How can correctional  managers  properly  justify  a major  management  policy\nas devastating  to  individual  inmates  as  is  Protective  Custody  status,  on the\nbasis  of  \"liability-risk  fear\"?  They  can't!\nAll  that  is  really  necessary  is  to  get  Protective  Custody  on the  Executive\nManagement  Team project  agenda.  Get  necessary  legislation,  Standards,  rules,\npolicies,  procedures,  post-orders,  and staff  training  programs  updated  to  deal\nwith  the  issues  and then  -  Abort  Protective  Custody.  Because  the  issues may\nbe legally  complex  and  liability-risk  is  a barrier  of  concern,  begin  accepting\nthe  challenge  by consulting  a counselor  -  legal  counselor.\nLegal  counsel  will,  in  all  likelihood,  advise  the  same concerning  Protective\n1 Custody  as would  be offered  in  any other  correctional  management  issue.  That\nis,  that  the  correctional  manager  is  not  negligent,  (i.e.,  liable)  if  reason- .\nable,  prudent  steps  are  taken  and sound correctional  practices  are  in  place,\nwithin  the  framework  of  law,  rules,  policies,  procedures,  post-orders  and im-\nplemented with  quality  staff  training  and good documentation.  Legal  counsel\nwill  likely  add:\n1.  A request  for  Protective  Custody  cannot  simply  be ignored;\n2.  The requesting  inmate  can be required  to  plejid  facts  and not  mere\nm  —  r -•  _  •\nconclusions that he/she is fearful of other inmates;\n- 24 -\n\n3.  If after careful examination of the facts the correctional manager\ncan make a reasonable, good faith determination that the inmate is\nnot in real danger, then liability is minimal to none;\n4.  Adequate protection effort, if danger is evident, does not need to\ninclude isolation of the inmate.\nEssentially, legal counsel will advise that if administrators and staff are\nperforming in a professional, responsible manner, have good policies and have\ntaken reasonable steps attentive to the inmate's expressed fears, it is not\nnecessary to isolate in separate quarters to overcome liability-risk.  With\ncompetent legal counsel on the issues, correctional managers should be imme-\ndiately reassured and can proceed accordingly to accept the challenge to Abort\nProtective Custody.  Total institution operations, staff and inmates will all\njLor tthe effort.  Money saved can be better spent on staff\ntraining  prograammss^^o  sustain  the  institution  as a Protective  Environment\nThroughout,  With  Equal  Opportunity  and Equal  Protection  For  All.  Nothing  less\ncan be viewed  as professionally  acceptable!!\nSUMMARY\nThis brief treatise on Protective Custody is a product of a firm belief that\n\"segregation by mutual consent\" is nonetheless segregation and that this par-\nticular form of non-disciplinary segregation is an admission of failure on the\npart of correctional administrators to provide equal opportunity, with equal\nprotection, for all inmates.  It is our professional opinions that Protective\nCustody treats one of the symptoms of an institutional social malady, but has\nthe net effect of feeding the disease itself.  The widespread practice of\nwarehousing separately those inmates who present special management challenges\nis a \"quick fix\" for an ad hoc problem, but leads to a growing addiction - the\nwithdrawal from which is both costly and painful.\nThis paper also seriously questions the legality of unbridled use of this form\n,.of separatism, and unabashedly chides our profession for both the lack of\nresponsible research and a very timid position which amounts to tacit approval\nof continued social segregation.\n- 25 -\n\nThese pages also call attention to the enormous costs involved  in the opera-\ntion of \"separate-but-equal\" institutions within institutions, and insists\nthat this is not the most efficient application of public funds.\nAll of. these questions and admonitions can, however, be viewed as naive criti-\ncism or idle indulgence in the game of \"Ain't It a Shame\" - unless they are\ncoupled with a valid conviction that we can, as a profession, reverse the\ntrend in the use of Protective Custody.  While we do not have a magic wand to\noffer, we are convinced that honest commitment, proper planning, and adequate\nresource allocation will substantially diminish the \"unacceptable to all\"\npractice of operating Leper Colonies in our institutions.  There is proof\navailable that it can be done - seek it - join the campaign - confront the\nchallenge:  Abort Protective Custody!\nIf, after careful study, the correctional manager has to conclude he/she can-\nnot at this time or for the forseeable future reduce or eliminate Protective\nCustody placements and programs, then we ask that they assure compliance with\nStandard 2-4220 and —  READ ON!\nPS:  Reference on pages 6 and 13 to final study report should be checked to\nassure accuracy.\n- 26 -\n\n\" STATE OF OREGON\nCORRECTION^ !nst/?.elease/\nDepartment  of  Human  Resources\nCorrections  Division\nRL'LE GOVERNING  INMATE  ?ROHI3IT\"D\nCONDUCT, AND PROCEDURE: FOR\nPROCESSING  DISCIPLINARY  ACTION\n251-1C5-OC5  I\nUr.dsr the authority de'iscatec to the Administrator by the Director of\nthe Departi-nent of Human Resources, and pursuant to ORS 179.040 and\n423.050, the Corrections  Division  shall make and adopt rules, nc: in-\nconsistent with law, for the guidance, government  and acminist-sticn cf\nits institutions; schools, programs, and services.\nII.

From 1974 through 1979, there\nwas a noticeable decrease in the number of sharpened instruments in the possession\nof inmates and no employees were killed.  In 1974, a more stringent sanction for\npossession of a sharpened instrument was instituted.  The sanction implemented was  J\nten (10) days in isolation followed by up to one-hundred and eighty (180) days adminis-\ntrative segregation with review every thirty (30) days thereafter, cancellation of\nthe inmate's honor contract and loss of good time to include all accumulated good time,\nEXHIBIT \"B\" TO MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO MODIFY THE MAXIMUM\nSECURITY POLICY STATEMENT OF THE CONSENT DECREE - Page 1 of 3 pages\n\nCNMCF - AFFIDAVIT\nPage 2\nwhich was not reinstated without the approval of the Director of Corrections, which\noccurred only in rare instances.  In addition, stringent sanctions are still  in place\nat the Penitentiary, the institution reserves the right to conduct a search of any\narea in the facility in which a weapon is found that may last up to three (3) working\ndays without the declaration of an emergency status.  Inmates are not paid for working\nduring this time and may be confined to their cells;\n(5)  That in the State of Nebraska, the presence of sharpened instruments in their\nfacilities was rare in 1979 and still reportedly remains rare at this time.  The sanc-\ntion for possession of a weapon or sharpened instrument in 1979 included fourteen  (14)\ndays to one (1) year of disciplinary segregation, potential  loss erf good time and\nclassifiction to administrative segregation following the completion of the discipli-\nnary sanction.  In 1973, the sanction was changed to include fourteen  (14) days to\nthree (3) years of disciplinary segregation, potential  loss of good time and possible\nclassification to administrative segregation following the completion of the discipli-\nnary sanction.  In 1985, the sanction included:  sixty (60) days disciplinary segrega-\ntion, potential  loss of good time and placement in Intensive Management Segregation\nin the Nebraska State Penitentiary.  The inmates placed in Intensive Management Segre-\ngation are reviewed every six (6) months;\n(6)  That in the State Arkansas in 1979, the inmates found in possession of\nsharpened instruments could receive up to thirty (30) days disciplinary segregation,  \\s\npotential  loss of good time, potential  loss of good time earning potential and classi-\nfication action, including assignment to administrative segregation status, which is\nreviewed every thirty (30) days;\n\nCNMC'F - AFFIDAVIT\nPage 3\n(7)  That at the Central New Mexico Correctional  Facility, there has been found\na total of forty-four (44) sharpened instruments that could have caused death or\nserious injury in the cells or on the person of inmates at this facility.  From July,\n1983, to January, 1984, eight (8) instruments were found in the possession of inmates.\nFrom January, 1984, to January, 1985, a total of twenty (20) sharpened instruments\nwere found in the possession of inmates.  From January, 1985, through June, 1985,\nseventeen (17) sharpened instruments were found in the possession of inmates.  This\nindicates an increase in the number of sharpened instruments found in the cells or on\nthe person of inmates at this facility.\n(8)  That from July, 1983, through June, 1985, a total of fifty-one (51) sharpened\ninstruments that could have caused serious bodily injury or death have been found in\nthe common areas of the housing units or within the compound, including work areas;\n(10)  That seventy-one (71) inmates have requested and been placed in protective\ncustody from June, 1983, through June, 1985;\n(11)  That it has been my experience that there is a direct correlation between the\nseverity of the sanctions for possession of sharpened instruments and in the reduction\nof the presence of those instruments in a correctional  facility.  In addition, the\nreduction of the presence of sharpened instruments within a correctional  facility in-\ncreases the safety of both inmates and staff.\nf-z-rr\nDATE  DARELD L.

Apodaca\nDefendants.\n;1  -• •NHHBMB V-MB0.B V0HIB1IVI -• • •• 0• •45\nSTIPULATION\niI  In order to resolve the issues placed in dispute by\nplaintiffs' January 29, 1996 Motion for Temporary  Restraining\nOrder and Motion For Injunctive and Other Remedial Relief, the\nundersigned parties, through their respective attorneys, hereby\nenter into this stipulation on this 29th day of March 1996.\n1.  Defendants, on a continuing and ongoing basis, will\n,;develop and implement all feasible means to maximize the\navailability and use of all medium security beds in cells within\nthe New Mexico Corrections Department  (\"NMCD\").  Defendants will\n, work closely with the special master-/ to accomplish  these\n•'objectives.  The special master will maintain  ongoing\ni\niicommunication with plaintiffs' counsel to apprise the latter of\n| jprogress on these matters and will keep plaintiffs' counsel fully\n! iinformed of all efforts defendants take or decline to take to\n!|A/  For  the  purposes  of  this  stipulation,  the  term  \"special\njjmaster\" includes Vincent M. Nathan, W. David Arnold, or both.\n\n.maximize the availability and use of all medium security cell\nbeds within the NMCD.\n2.  In order to provide housing for medium security\nprisoners-^ for whom no cell beds are available in spite of\n:measures taken by defendants pursuant to paragraph l of this\nstipulation, and only upon continued compliance with paragraph l\nof this stipulation, defendants will assign such prisoners to\nbeds in a dayroom (\"dayroom beds\") only at Central New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility (\"CNMCF\") and Southern New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility (\"SNMCF\").  Defendants may assign prisoners\n>to no more than 70 such beds at CNMCF and to no more than 70 such\nbeds at SNMCF, for a total of 140 dayroom beds.  In addition, if\nbeds in cells are not available at the Reception & Diagnostic\nCenter (\"RDC\"), defendants may continue to assign prisoners to no\nmore than 45 dayroom beds at the RDC at Western New Mexico\nCorrectional Facility (\"WNMCF\").\n3.  So long as defendants are complying with paragraph l of\nthis stipulation, have no available cells for housing medium\nsecurity prisoners, and have assigned no fewer than 12 0 but no\nmore than 140 medium security prisoners to dayroom beds at CNMCF\nand SNMCF pursuant to paragraph 2 of this stipulation, defendants\nmay assign no more than 350 medium security prisoners to the\nDallas County Jail or to another jail facility in Texas,\nhereinafter referred to collectively as \"Texas facility\" or\n-/  In the absence of specific  language to the contrary, all\nreferences  to  \"prisoner,\"  \"prisoners,\"  or  \"medium  security\nprisoners\" throughout this stipulation include anly male prisoners.\n\n:i\"Texas facilities\".  The following conditions will apply to the\n'assignment of prisoners to a Texas facility:\nA.  Defendants will ensure that officials at the Dallas\nCounty Jail expand or permit expansion of correspondence\n|!privileges (increased availability of writing materials,\nenvelopes, and stamps) and access to legal materials (expansion\nof the collection of New Mexico legal research materials), as\nrecommended to NMCD. officials by the special master.\nB. Any Texas jail to which prisoners are transferred,\nother than the Dallas County Jail, must be of at least comparable\n;|quality to the Dallas County Jail in terms of physical plant and\nthe provision of services to prisoners, including correspondence\nand legal access services described in subparagraph 3(A) of this\nstipulation.  Prior to the transfer of any prisoner to a Texas\njail other than the Dallas County Jail, the special master will\ninspect the proposed facility and certify its comparability to\nthe Dallas County Jail.\nC.  Defendants may only transfer newly received\nprisoners to Texas facilities directly from the RDC.  All such\nprisoners must be classified as medium security, and no such\nI prisoner can be under indictment or be in the process of pursuing\na direct appeal of his criminal conviction at the time of his\n; transfer.-^  Defendants may apply other criteria (e.g.,\n-1  The exclusion  of prisoners under  indictment  or pursuing a\n' direct appeal does not encompass prisoners who are in the process\nof  making  a  collateral  attack,  by  writ  of  habeas  corpus  or\notherwise, on their conviction, plea, or sentence.\n\nichronic medical or mental health condition, unusual hardship) to\n; i\n'exclude prisoners from eligibility for transfer to a Texas\nfacility, but the failure to identify a sufficient number of\nmedium security prisoners at the RDC who are eligible for\ntransfer to a Texas facility will not constitute an excuse for\nnoncompliance with any provision of this stipulation.\nD.  No prisoner assigned to a Texas facility will be\nassigned to such a facility a second time unless that person's\nconduct results in his readmission to the NMCD as a new admission\n. ito the RDC.  \"Readmission to the NMCD as a new admission\"\niiincludes persons returned as parole violators; persons returned\nas probation violators; violators of conditions of reintegration;\nand persons who were previously incarcerated, then released, then\nadmitted pursuant to a new or separate conviction.\nE.  All prisoners assigned to a Texas facility in the\nfuture will be returned to and physically housed in a New Mexico\npenal facility as quickly as possible and in no event\nlater than 120 calendar days from the date the prisoner leaves\nthe RDC.\n4.  As soon as possible, and in no event later than July l,\n1996, defendants will return to New Mexico penal facilities all\n;New Mexico prisoners presently incarcerated in the Dallas County\n•Jail or the Tarrant County Jail in the State of Texas.\nDefendants will first return all prisoners currently assigned to\n• i\nlithe Tarrant County Jail.  Defendants will make every reasonable\neffort to assign any such returning prisoner to a bed in a cell\n\n> j and will provide the special master with a written explanation of\nj!\n'a decision to assign any such prisoner to a dayroom bed.\n;;  5.  Upon their return to New Mexico, all prisoners currently\n'assigned to a Texas facility and all prisoners assigned to a\nTexas facility in the future will be transferred directly to an\nNMCD penal facility other than the RDC.\ni  6.  If defendants are in compliance with paragraph l of this\nstipulation, defendants may assign more than 140 prisoners to\ndayroom beds at CNMCF and SNMCF in order to accomplish in a\n. jtimely fashion the transfers required by paragraph 4 of this\nI i\nhstipulation.  If defendants assign more than 140 prisoners to\n'dayroom beds pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,\ndefendants shall reduce the number of prisoners assigned to such\ndayroom beds to 140 no later than September 30, 1996.\nThereafter, if defendants are in compliance with paragraphs l, 2,\nand 3 of this stipulation and the maximum number of prisoners\n(350) are assigned to Texas facilities, defendants may assign\nadditional medium security prisoners to dayroom beds at CNMCF and\nSNMCF in order to provide housing for medium security prisoners\n:ifor whom no cell is available.  In no event, however, will\n/defendants assign more than 300 medium security prisoners to\ni i\ni dayroom beds, including such beds at the RDC (wherever it is\n•ilocated) and the New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility.\n!i  7.  No provisions of the court's orders in this cause\n•i\nrelating to conditions of confinement, apart from the provisions\n\nI iof this stipulation, will apply to prisoners while they are\nI1\nhoused in a Texas facility.\n8.  Because of the lack of work and educational\nopportunities in Texas facilities, every prisoner currently\njI assigned to a Texas facility and every prisoner assigned to a\n:Texas facility in the future will earn day-for-day good time,\nregardless of the prisoner's employment or programmatic status in\na Texas facility, subject to the NMCD's current regulations\ngoverning termination and forfeiture of good time for misconduct\n.and consistent with the requirements of NMSA §33-2-34.  In\niI addition, every prisoner currently assigned to a Texas facility\nand every prisoner assigned to a Texas facility in the future,\nupon his return to a New Mexico penal institution, will be\nawarded six days of lump-sum good time for each month or portion\nthereof the prisoner spent in a Texas facility, subject to the\nNMCD's current regulations governing forfeiture of good time for\nmisconduct.\n9.  Any prisoner assigned to a Texas facility in the future\nmay file a classification appeal challenging his designation as\nmedium security or any other element of the classification, and\ni!\nany such appeal will be resolved in accordance with the\n^classification appeals policies of the NMCD.  Such an appeal,\ni\n.however, will not be subject to the special provisions and\nlimitations controlling an appeal of an out-of-state transfer.\n; iAny complaint concerning assignment to a Texas facility (as\nopposed to complaints about other facets of the classification\n\n'process) will be treated as a grievance and will be resolved\ni\nunder the grievance procedures of the NMCD.  If the filing of a\nclassification appeal would otherwise be timely, NMCD will accept\nclassification appeals from prisoners after their transfer to a\nTexas facility.  Moreover, defendants also will establish a\nprocedural mechanism by which prisoners assigned to a Texas\nfacility can submit grievances to NMCD officials.  Defendants\nwill provide the special master with a copy of any such\nclassification appeal or grievance by a prisoner selected for\n;transfer to a Texas facility, including prisoners currently\n'assigned to a Texas facility, and the special master will review\nthese appeals and grievances and communicate with NMCD officials\nto ensure that fair and timely decisions are rendered.\n10.  Plaintiffs hereby withdraw, without prejudice, their\nJanuary 29, 1996 Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and\nMotion For Injunctive and Other Remedial Relief.\n11.  As long as defendants comply with the provisions of\nthis stipulation and with paragraphs II.A, B, and C of the June\n10, 1991 Settlement Agreement, and until the opening of a new\nmedium security prison in Santa Rosa, New Mexico, plaintiffs will\nnot file any legal action challenging the assignment of prisoners\nto Texas facilities or the assignment of prisoners to dayroom\nbeds.  In the event plaintiffs' counsel believe defendants are in\nnoncompliance with a provision of this stipulation, they may file\na legal action, for contempt or otherwise, challenging the\nassignment of prisoners to Texas facilities or the assignment of\n\nI;prisoners to dayroom beds, but only following the exhaustion of\nall of the following steps:\nA.  Based upon information received from the special\n•master pursuant to paragraph 1 of this stipulation, or upon\njiinformation received from other sources, plaintiffs' counsel\nformally request an investigation and written report by the\nspecial master concerning defendants' alleged noncompliance with\nany provision of this stipulation.\nB.  The special master conducts an investigation, which\nhe has represented to the parties he will accomplish as promptly\nlas possible, and issues a written report containing a finding of\nnoncompliance with this stipulation.\nC.  The parties, within ten business days following the\nspecial master's issuance of a written report containing a\nfinding of such noncompliance, fail to reach agreement during the\ncourse of good faith negotiations regarding instances of\nnoncompliance found by the special master.\n12.  If plaintiffs file a legal action pursuant to paragraph\n11 of this stipulation, defendants will be free to raise all\navailable defenses in response to such action, including\nchallenging the special master's finding of non-compliance.\n8\n\nt  13. The parties will file this stipulation for the court's\nreview and approval.\nMark Doni\nRothstein, Donatelli, Hughes,\nDahlstrom, Cron & Schoenburg\nP.O.

      "text": "Case 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200   Filed 02/10/20   Page 1 of 7\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO \n \n   \nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.,   \n   \n     Plaintiffs,   \n   \nv.     1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY \n    \nMICHELLE LUJAN-GRISHAM, \nGovernor, et al., \n \n     Defendants. \n \n \n \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL  \nOF THE SECOND REVISED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \nThe  parties  jointly  move  for  this  Court  to  approve  the  Second  Revised  Settlement \nAgreement (“SRSA”), attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \nThe SRSA is identical to the Revised Settlement Agreement (“RSA”) that was filed on \nAugust 21, 2019 (ECF No. 3067-1), and which was preliminarily approved by the Court on \nSeptember 5, 2019 (ECF No. 3072), except it contains three substantive modifications that the \nparties agreed to after the Court’s preliminary approval order. A redline showing the changes \nbetween the RSA and the SRSA is attached as Exhibit B. \nThe parties have already explained why the RSA should be approved by the Court in their \nJoint Motion for Final Approval of Revised Settlement Agreement (ECF Docs. 3174, 3184), and \nat  the  February  3,  2020  hearing  on  final  approval.  This  Joint  Motion  explains  why  the \nmodifications in the SRSA should also be approved. This Joint Motion also explains why these \nmodifications benefit the Plaintiff class and thus do not require the class to be provided with \nanother round of notice and another opportunity to object. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200   Filed 02/10/20   Page 2 of 7\n \n1.  The Modifications in the SRSA \nThe SRSA contains three substantive modifications to the RSA, as shown in Exhibit B. \n(The SRSA also modifies the introductory paragraph to fully explain the procedural history of the \nagreement, but those modifications do not affect the substantive rights or obligations of the \nparties.) \nFirst, the SRSA corrects a typographical error in Paragraph 1(d)(ii)(3) of the RSA that was \nidentified by a class member. This paragraph is modified to add the following underlined words: \nNo more than five prisoners per dayroom shall be assigned to dayrooms in any \nfacility and the dayroom housing must provide a minimum of 50 square feet of \ncombined living and sleeping space per inmate (excluding the cell left open for \nhygiene, as set forth below). \nCounsel for Plaintiffs and Defendants agreed to this modification on the record at the hearing on \nfinal approval held on February 3, 2020. This modification should be approved because it clarifies \nthe meaning of this Paragraph as intended by the parties and ensures that there will be no confusion \nduring implementation of the SRSA. \nSecond, the SRSA modifies Paragraph 12 of the RSA in the manner described in the Joint \nMotion and Memorandum of Law for Approval of a Modification to Paragraph 12 of the Revised \nSettlement Agreement (the “Joint Motion to Modify Paragraph 12”), filed January 31, 2020 (ECF \nNo.  3186).  As  described  in  that  joint  motion,  this  modification  requires  the  New  Mexico \nCorrections Department (“NMCD”) to submit Parole Board Docket Forms and Parole Plans to the \nAdult Parole Board (the “Parole Board”) “90 days prior to a class member’s projected release date \nfor class members serving parole in New Mexico and no later than 120 days prior to the class \nmember’s projected release date if the class member will serve parole out of state.” Under the prior \nRSA, Paragraph 12 required these documents to be submitted to the Parole Board “no later than \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200   Filed 02/10/20   Page 3 of 7\n30 days prior to a class member’s hearing date,” but after the RSA was signed the parties \ndetermined that this timing requirement did not make sense because they learned that the parole \nhearing date was not scheduled until the Parole Board received the Parole Board Docket Form and \nParole Plan. The modification to Paragraph 12 in the SRSA thus corrects this error in the timing \nfor submission of these documents and effectuates the parties’ intent when the RSA was signed to \nensure that the process of parole planning for class members begins well in advance of their \nprojected release dates. This modification should be approved for all the reasons stated in the Joint \nMotion to Modify Paragraph 12 (ECF No. 3186). \nThird, the SRSA modifies Paragraph 17 of the RSA to add an additional group of class \nmembers from Otero County Prison Facility (“OCPF”), who will be eligible to receive the remedial \nrelief good time awards described in that paragraph. The category of class members who will be \nadded are inmates who were “housed for at least 60 in dormitories days at OCPF from October 1, \n2016 until the date the Court finds Defendants are in substantial compliance with subparagraph \n(1)(b)(iv) of the [SRSA].” The parties agreed to this modification on the record at the hearing for \nfinal approval on February 3, 2020.  \nUnder Paragraphs 1(b)(i)–(iv) of the RSA, Defendants are required to reduce the number \nof  class  members  housed  in  the  dormitories  at  four  facilities:  Northwestern  New  Mexico \nCorrectional  Facility  (“NWNMCF”),  Springer  Correctional  Center  (“SCC”),  Western  New \nMexico Correctional Facility (“WNMCF”), and OCPF. Under Paragraph 17 of the RSA, the class \nmembers who had been housed at these facilities prior to the Defendants’ substantial compliance \nwith the transfers were to receive an award of good time as “remedial relief,” except this relief was \nnot given to the class members who had been housed at OCPF. The exclusion of class members at \nOCPF was a contentious issue during the negotiations of the RSA. Although counsel for the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200   Filed 02/10/20   Page 4 of 7\nPlaintiff class worked hard to obtain this remedial relief for these class members, they were \nultimately forced to compromise on this issue in order to obtain a final agreement on the RSA. \nMany of the class members who filed objections to the RSA specifically objected to the exclusion \nof  class  members  housed  at  OCPF  from  the  remedial  relief  provided  under  Paragraph  17. \nApproximately 38 of the 92 objections specifically raised this issue as a ground for objecting to \nthe RSA. The modification to Paragraph 17 that was agreed to at the February 3, 2020 hearing \nsatisfies those objections. \nThis modification should be approved because it benefits members of the Plaintiff class \nand also treats all class members who were housed in dormitories equitably. This equitable \ntreatment supports approval of the SRSA because one of the factors the Court must consider when \napproving a class action settlement is whether “the proposal treats class members equitably relative \nto each other.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(D). As a general matter, good time awards are also an \nappropriate form of remedial relief for overcrowding and were awarded in the Court-approved \n2016 Settlement Agreement for violations of the 1991 Settlement Agreement at Western New \nMexico Correctional Facility (“WNMCF”) (ECF No. 2769). \nIn the Court’s Order granting preliminary approval to the RSA, the Court determined that \nthe RSA treated class members equitably relative to each other under Rule 23(e)(2)(D), and on the \nquestion of good time awards as remedial relief, the Court stated that “[c]ounsel have adequately \nexplained why some categories of inmates in the Plaintiff class will receive greater remedial relief \nthan others, and these differences in treatment are equitable and objectively reasonable in that they \navoid adverse impacts on public safety in accordance with the PLRA. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1), \n(c)(1).” (ECF No. 3072 at 6.) Defendants had previously explained that the inmates at OCPF were \nexcluded due to the nature of their crimes because that facility houses primarily sex offenders. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200   Filed 02/10/20   Page 5 of 7\n(OCPF also houses two dormitory units for prisoners who were formerly in law enforcement.) The \nmodification to Paragraph 17 provides even more equitable treatment to class members, and thus \nfurther supports the Court’s finding that approval is appropriate under Rule 23(e)(2)(D).  \nThis modification does not adversely impact public safety under the Prison Litigation \nReform Act (“PLRA”). 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1). Paragraph 17 expressly requires the good time \nawards to be consistent with NMSA 1978 § 33-2-34(A) (2015). That state statute provides that \nprisoners confined for nonviolent offenses can receive meritorious deductions up to a maximum \nof thirty days per month of time served, but prisoners confined for serious violent offenses can \nreceive meritorious deductions up to a maximum of four days per month of time served. See \nNMSA 1978 § 33-2-34(A) (2015). This statute reflects the State’s balancing of interests in \npermitting good time awards for prisoners but also preserving public safety. The majority of class \nmembers at OCPF who will receive a remedial relief good time award under the modification to \nParagraph 17 are imprisoned for serious violent offenses and thus will be entitled under this state \nstatute to receive no more than four days’ good time under that modification. The SRSA thus does \nnot conflict with the Court’s previous finding regarding public safety because it incorporates the \nState’s balancing of public safety interests under state law.  \nAdditionally, while the Court had previously found in its order granting preliminary \napproval that exclusion of some prisoners from the remedial relief provision was justified due to \npublic safety considerations, Defendants informed the Court at the February 3, 2020 hearing that \nthere are sex offenders in dormitories in New Mexico prisons other than the OCPF. Such prisoners \nwould have been eligible to receive the remedial relief under Paragraph 17 of the RSA. That fact \nfurther confirms that the modification to Paragraph 17 is appropriate because there is no public \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:77-cv-00721-KK-SCY   Document 3200   Filed 02/10/20   Page 6 of 7\nsafety justification for treating the inmates in dormitories at OCPF differently from the inmates in \ndormitories in other New Mexico prisons who have committed similar offenses. \n2.  Additional Notice and Opportunity to Object is Not Required \nAs explained in the parties’ Joint Motion to Modify Paragraph 12, courts have generally \nheld that when a class action settlement is modified, Rule 23(e) does not require a second notice \nif the modifications are not detrimental to the class. (ECF No. 3186 at 5–7.) Each of the above \nmodifications benefits the Plaintiff class and none of these modifications harms any member of \nthe Plaintiff class. Thus, the parties believe that an additional round of notice and objection is not \nrequired under Rule 23(e). Indeed, an additional round of notice and objections would potentially \ndelay approval and implementation of these modifications, which would not benefit of class \nmembers. \n3.  Conclusion \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Parties respectfully request that the Court approve the \nSRSA and decline to require an additional round of notice and objections. \n     \n                 Respectfully Submitted, \nHECTOR BALDERAS  LAW OFFICE OF ALEXANDRA \nNEW MEXICO ATTORNEY GENERAL  FREEDMAN SMITH \n/s/ Jennifer Saavedra  /s/ Alexandra Freedman Smith \nJennifer Saavedra  925 Luna Circle, NW \nOlga Serafimova  Albuquerque, NM 87102 \nAssistant Attorneys General  (505) 413-8884 \nPost Office Drawer 1508  asmith@smith-law.nm.com   \nSanta Fe, NM 87504-1508   \n(505) 490-4053  ROTHSTEIN DONATELLI LLP \n  Mark H.

Davis, Albuquerque, N.M., with him on the \nbrief), for plaintiffs-appellees. \n1493*1493 Before SEYMOUR, EBEL, and McWILLIAMS, Circuit Judges. \nMcWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge. \nIn 1977, Duran, and others, all inmates at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (\"PNM\"), brought \na class action against the Governor of New Mexico, and other state officials, including the \nWarden of the PNM, alleging that in their operation of the penitentiary the defendants, \nacting under the color of state law, violated the plaintiffs' federal rights, both constitutional \nand statutory, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In 1980, a consent decree agreed to by the \nparties was entered by the district court. This decree was comprehensive in nature and set \nforth in detail rules and regulations which would govern the defendants in their operation of \nthe prison. \nHowever, the 1980 decree did not end the matter. Subsequent thereto, both plaintiffs and \ndefendants monitored the compliance by the parties with the decree. Also, plaintiffs, on \noccasion, sought to hold the defendants in contempt for noncompliance. In turn, the \ndefendants, on occasion, sought modification or outright vacation of the consent decree. \nMany of these disputes were settled by agreement of the parties, although the consent \ndecree itself remained in force and effect. \nIn 1987, the defendants sought to vacate certain parts of the 1980 consent decree, \ncontending that portions of the decree were not tied to, nor did they tend to vindicate, \n\nfederal rights, and that under Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. \n89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), a federal district court was barred under the \neleventh amendment from thus enjoining state officials. The district court, after hearing, \ndenied the motion to vacate. Duran v. Carruthers, 678 F.Supp. 839 (D.N.M.1988). The \ndefendants appealed the district court's order denying their motion to vacate. We have this \ndate affirmed the district court's order. See Duran v. Carruthers, 885 F.2d 1485 (10th \nCir.1989). \nThe present appeal is from two orders of the district court awarding plaintiffs' attorneys' fees \nand costs. The first order was entered by the district court on October 25, 1988, and covers \nwork done by plaintiffs' counsel, and costs incurred, between October 3, 1985, and June 30, \n1986. The total amount of that award, including attorneys' fees and costs, was $77,611.38. \nThe second order appealed from was entered November 2, 1988, and covers work done by \nplaintiffs' counsel, and costs incurred, between July 1, 1986, through April 30, 1987. The \ntotal amount of that award, including attorneys' fees and costs, was $325,091.97. \nAs stated, the first of the two orders involved in the present appeal was entered on October \n25, 1988. There was no hearing held on the matter, and it was decided by the district court \non the basis of the plaintiffs' amended motion for attorneys' fees and costs, including \nitemized statements in support of the motion, and the defendants' response thereto. In that \norder the district court held that post-judgment services necessary to reasonable monitoring \nof the consent decree were compensable under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. However, the district \ncourt noted that in awarding fees and costs it was \"faced with ... [certain] difficulties.\" \nNamely, the plaintiffs in their amended motion stated that they were not seeking attorneys' \nfees in connection with a contempt citation, but their amended summary did not isolate \nthose fees and costs which were attributable to the contempt proceeding. In the same vein, \nthe district court also stated that there were other inconsistencies between the amounts \nclaimed in the amended motion and the amended summary. Because of these \"difficulties,\" \nthe district court \"invited\" both parties to request the district court to amend the order should \nthey believe that the district court erred in either awarding fees and costs that were \nimproper or in not awarding fees and costs which were proper. The district court went on to \nitemize hours expended, rejecting certain claims as duplicative or unnecessary, multiplying \nthe hours by a reasonable hourly rate, granting certain costs and rejecting others, and \neventually arrived at a total figure of $77,611.38. \nThe defendants filed a timely request to amend the district court's order of October \n1494*1494 25, 1988. They first asked that the district court amend its order to specifically \nprovide that the October 25 order was final and appealable and suggested several ways \nthis could be done. By their motion the defendants also sought amendment of the October \n25, 1988 order to delete post-judgment interest. The defendants also sought amendment of \nthe October 25 order so as to eliminate any award of attorneys' fees for plaintiffs' monitoring \nof the defendants' compliance with the consent decree. The request to amend did not \nchallenge the district court's computation or suggest any clerical errors. \nOn January 23, 1989, the district court granted, in part, defendants' motion to amend, \ngranting that part of defendants' motion which sought to make the October 25 order final \nand appealable by incorporating the language of Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). However, the district \n\ncourt denied the balance of the motion. In so doing, the district court indicated that the \nprovision in the October 25 order inviting counsel to file a motion to amend was for the \npurpose of correcting any \"clerical or computational error\" and that it did not propose to \n\"otherwise\" amend its earlier order. \nAs stated, the second order involved in this appeal was entered November 2, 1988. The \norder was based on plaintiffs' motion and application for attorneys' fees and costs for the \nperiod from July 1, 1986, through April 30, 1987, but also included attorneys' fees and costs \nincurred in connection with a contempt matter which dated back to 1985. The defendants \nfiled a response to plaintiffs' motion, to which response plaintiffs filed a reply. The district \ncourt determined that a hearing was unnecessary and based its order on the record. \nAgain, the district court held that plaintiffs were entitled to be reimbursed for their post-\njudgment services necessary for reasonable monitoring of defendants' compliance with the \nconsent decree. And again, the district court was concerned about the possibility of \n\"duplication\" and granted the parties 15 days to request amendment of the November 2 \norder. The district court proceeded to rule that certain of the hours claimed were \nunnecessary or duplicative, and, multiplying the allowable hours by a reasonable hourly \nrate, as well as identifying the allowable costs, arrived at a total figure of $325,091.97.[1] \nThe defendants filed a timely request for amendment of the November 2 order. The \ndefendants first asked the district court to amend the order to specifically state that the \norder was final and appealable and suggested alternative ways this could be done. The \ndefendants also asked that the award of post-judgment interest be deleted, arguing that \nsuch interest was improper regardless of whether the ruling was a final order or an interim \norder. Also, in line with their earlier request to amend the October 25 order, the defendants \nobjected to any award for plaintiffs' monitoring of defendants' compliance with the consent \ndecree. \nThe district court granted the defendants' request that the November 2 order be amended \nso that it would be final and appealable and added to its order the language of Fed.R.Civ.P. \n54(b). The balance of the defendants' request to amend was denied, the district court \nindicating that it did not propose to change its position on \"substantive\" matters, and that \ncounsel had not suggested that there were any \"clerical or computational errors\" in the \nNovember 2 order. \nIt is agreed that an appellate court plays a \"limited role\" in reviewing a district court's award \nof attorneys' fees and costs, and deference is given to a district court's judgment on the \nmatter, since the district court is in a better position to assess the course of litigation and \nquality of work. However, one who seeks attorneys' fees and costs bears the burden of first \nestablishing his, or her, entitlement thereto and 1495*1495 thereafter must also establish \nthe appropriate time expended and a reasonable hourly rate therefor. The amount of an \naward of attorneys' fees and costs will be upset on appeal only if it represents an abuse of \ndiscretion. See Mares v. Credit Bureau of Raton, 801 F.2d 1197 (10th Cir.1986) for an \nextended discussion of this matter. \"An abuse of discretion occurs when a judicial \ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious or whimsical.\" United States v. Wright, 826 F.2d 938, \n943 (10th Cir.1987). \n\nBoth in the district court, and on appeal, the defendants challenge plaintiffs' entitlement to \nfees and costs incurred by them in monitoring defendants' compliance, or lack of it, with the \nmyriad terms and provisions in the 1980 consent decree which govern the defendants in \ntheir operation of the penitentiary. In thus arguing, the defendants recognize that there are \ncases which have permitted an award of attorneys' fees for post-judgment monitoring. See \nNorthcross v. Board of Education of Memphis City Schools, 611 F.2d 624 (6th Cir.1979), \ncert. denied, 447 U.S. 911, 100 S.Ct. 2999, 64 L.Ed.2d 862 (1980); Miller v. Carson, 628 \nF.2d 346 (5th Cir.1980); and Garrity v. Sununu, 752 F.2d 727 (1st Cir.1984). Counsel \nargues that those cases should not be followed in the instant case for the reason that a \nSpecial Master, appointed in 1983 by agreement of the parties, has been monitoring \ndefendants' compliance, and also that the New Mexico Department of Corrections has put \nin place an \"internal monitoring structure.\" Such being the case, counsel describes plaintiffs' \nmonitoring as \"essentially gratuitous, self-initiated and redundant,\" as well as being \n\"unnecessary, duplicative and superfluous.\" \nPursuant to the 1980 consent decree, the New Mexico Department of Corrections created \nan internal monitoring body to check out defendants' compliance with the terms and \nprovisions of the agreement, an agreement which the defendants voluntarily entered into in \n1980. In 1981 the defendants' compliance monitor filed two reports which were quite critical \nof the defendants' efforts to comply. Shortly thereafter that monitor was discharged. In any \nevent, the internal monitoring scheme was not particularly effective, and in 1983, by \nagreement of the parties, the district court entered an Order of Reference which included \nthe appointment of a Special Master for the purpose of monitoring defendants' compliance. \nThe Special Master has since filed some 25 reports. Under the agreement, the parties have \n15 days after receipt of such report to file objections. If a particular matter cannot be \nresolved by the parties and the Special Master, a party may request a court hearing. \nAs indicated, counsel argues that because of the Special Master, and the defendants' own \nmonitoring of its degree of compliance, plaintiffs' monitoring is unnecessary and duplicative. \nWith this argument we do not agree. To so hold would mean that the plaintiffs must accept \nreports of the Special Master and the defendants' own compliance officer at face value and \nthey would be unable to make any real challenge, backed with facts established by \nmonitoring, to such reports. See, e.g., McDonald v. Armontrout, 860 F.2d 1456 (8th \nCir.1988) (\"perseverance and a watchful eye\" enabled plaintiffs to file a motion for \ncontempt, to secure a compliance monitor and to obtain an agreement supplementing \nconsent decree). Under the consent decree, the plaintiffs' counsel are charged with \ncontinuing duties and responsibilities. For example, the consent decree provides that \nportions thereof shall become inoperative in case of an \"emergency,\" but reserves to the \nplaintiffs the right to contest the existence of an emergency. Also, by way of example, \nparagraph six of the 1980 agreement requires the defendants to advise the plaintiffs of any \n\"implementation\" sought by defendants and grants the plaintiffs time to object if they believe \nthat the implementation lessens the benefits granted them by the 1980 consent decree. \nFurther, if the matter cannot be resolved by the parties, the consent decree provides for a \ncourt hearing. In short, the 1980 consent decree was only the beginning, and counsel for \nthe plaintiffs has a continuing duty and responsibility to make sure that the defendants \ncomply, and continue to comply, with the decree. \n\n1496*1496 Wuori v. Concannon, 551 F.Supp. 185 (D.Maine 1982) and Brewster v. Dukakis, \n544 F.Supp. 1069 (D.Mass.1982), modified on other grounds, 786 F.2d 16 (1st Cir.1986), \nboth involved consent decrees with a Special Master to monitor the parties' compliance \ntherewith. In each instance, the court awarded the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs \nincurred in their own monitoring activities. In Brewster, at page 1072, Judge Frank H. \nFreedman spoke as follows: \nPlaintiffs' counsel have played a vigorous and necessary role in implementation. They have \nassisted in the drafting of regulations, negotiated myriad administrative disputes with the \ndefendants without the necessity of court intervention, consulted with the court-appointed \nMonitor and participated in mediation with the Monitor regarding disputes not subject to \nadministrative resolution, evaluated the progress towards implementation of the Decree \nthrough frequent meetings with Department of Mental Health personnel, reported and \nvigorously pressed charges of client abuse or neglect both in the community and in the \nhospital, represented clients during hearings on the drafting of individual service plans \ncalled for in the Decree, negotiated several amendments to various paragraphs of the \nDecree and participated in final negotiations around issues left open by the Decree itself. \nSeveral evidentiary hearings on issues such as human resources, legal advocacy and \nbudgetary matters have taken place before this Court, particularly in the past two years. \nPlaintiffs' counsel have represented the class in three hearings before the First Circuit Court \nof Appeals. \nAs in other institutional reform litigation, the entry of the Court's judgment has not \nterminated the role of the plaintiffs' counsel. In important respects, entry of judgment has \nrepresented only a beginning. Without determined, competent and dedicated \nrepresentation, the provisions of this Consent Decree might have had little practical \nsignificance for the class members. \nJudge Freedman's comment concerning the role of plaintiffs' counsel in the case before him \naptly describes the role of plaintiffs' counsel in the present case. \nA portion of the November 2 award of attorneys' fees and costs was for legal services \nrendered in connection with a motion to hold the defendants in contempt for noncompliance \nwith the 1980 consent decree, which motion was later withdrawn as a result of a stipulated \nagreement between the parties. So far as we can tell from the record before us, defendants \ndid not raise this matter in their request to amend the November 2 order. Be that as it may, \ncounsel argues in this Court that since the motion to hold in contempt was withdrawn, the \nplaintiffs did not \"prevail\" on the matter, as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Not having urged \nthis particular matter in their post-order request to amend, it is doubtful that the matter can \nbe raised here on appeal. Regardless, the argument is without merit. \nAt or about the time when the motion to hold the defendants in contempt was pending, the \ndefendants had themselves filed motions to modify the 1980 consent decree with respect to \nliving conditions, mental health, education, and medical services, inmate activities, and \ndouble-celling. The parties then entered into an agreement whereby plaintiffs agreed to \nwithdraw their contempt motion and the defendants agreed to withdraw their requests for \nmodification. The fact that defendants reserved the right to file a similar motion sometime in \nthe future doesn't alter the fact that the plaintiffs, for the time being at least, caused the \ndefendants to withdraw their request for wholesale modification of the consent decree. To \n\n\"prevail\" does not mean that a plaintiff in a proceeding of this sort must obtain \"total victory\" \nafter a full trial. 42 U.S.C. § 1988 contemplates that there will be an award of attorneys' fees \nand costs if the plaintiff vindicates his or her rights through settlement.[2] Maher v. \n1497*1497 Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980); \nChicano Police Officers Ass'n v. Stover, 624 F.2d 127, 131 (10th Cir.1980). \nDefendants' remaining arguments for reversing the district court's two orders for attorneys' \nfees and costs are also without merit. Some, so far as we can tell, were not urged by \ndefendants in their post-order requests to amend. In their post-order requests to amend \nboth orders, the defendants did not challenge the district court's computation, nor did they \nsuggest that plaintiffs were being awarded attorneys' fees to resist motions of the \ndefendants which have not yet been heard. \nFinally, the fact that the defendants intended to appeal the district court's denial of the \nmotion to vacate did not preclude the district court from awarding attorneys' fees for \nservices rendered in resisting the motion to vacate. This argument is somewhat mooted \nsince we have this date affirmed the district court's order denying defendants' motion to \nvacate. The award of attorneys' fees in the instant case was not premature. \nIn sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion, but gave the matter careful \nconsideration. The district court did not give the plaintiffs' attorneys carte blanche, as is \nsuggested by counsel. The October 25 order reduced plaintiffs' request by $16,844.66, and \nthe November 2 order reduced plaintiffs' request by $59,431.27.[3] \nJudgments and Orders affirmed. \n[1] Both the October 25 and November 2 orders covered the same type of services and costs: ongoing consent \ndecree monitoring activities, including monitoring in connection with a contempt proceeding initiated by the plaintiffs; \nactivities connected with defendants' motion for vacation or modification of the consent decree; and a motion by \ndefendants for double-celling of inmates, which motion the defendants withdrew and later filed in a revised motion for \nvacation or modification of the consent decree. \n[2] We reject out of hand a suggestion that plaintiffs did not \"prevail\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1988 when the \n1980 consent decree was entered. A reading of the \"book-like\" decree would indicate almost \"total victory\" for the \nplaintiffs. \n[3] The plaintiffs in this court ask that they be awarded attorneys' fees and costs for services rendered in resisting in \nthis Court the present appeal of the defendants and in the companion appeal, Duran v. Carruthers, 885 F.2d 1485 \n(10th Cir.1989). This is a matter which should be handled initially in the district court. \n ",

The Court finds and orders as follows:\n1.  In this Court's order confirming the 29th Report of the Special Master\n(\"29th Report\"),  filed January 29, 1992, the Court approved the Special Master's\nfindings of substantial compliance in all areas of the Court's orders at Southern\nNew  Mexico  Correctional  Facility and Western New Mexico Correctional  Facility.\nIn  addition, the Court  approved the Special  Master's  findings of substantial\ncompliance in all areas, with the exception of inmate activity, at the Central\nNew Mexico Correctional Facility.\n2.  In its order  confirming  the 29th  Report, the Court  established a\nschedule  and procedures for self-monitoring  and self-reporting  by Defendants\nwhich  were to address all areas in which the Special  Master had made  findings\nof  substantial  compliance.  The periods of self-monitoring and self-reporting\nfor  each  facility  were not shorter  than six months nor longer  than one year\nin accordance with the Modified Decree.\n\n3.  The  Defendants  filed  comprehensive  compliance  reports,  as  ordered,\nin  a  timely  fashion.  Plaintiffs  had  an  opportunity  to  verify  the  accuracy\nand completeness of such reports and filed any objections they had.\n4.  The  Modified  Decree,  approved  by  this  Court  on  December  20,  1991,\nprovides  that,  if  the  Defendants  remain  in  substantial  compliance  during  the\nperiod  of  self-monitoring  and  self-reporting,  the  provisions  of  the  Modified\nDecree  which  pertain  to  a  particular  facility  shall  be  vacated  with  respect\nto that particular facility.\n5.

      "text": "IN THE UNTTED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nDWIGHT DURAN, et al.\nf\nPlaintiffs,\nvs.  Civil No. 77-0721-JC\nGARY JOHNSON, et al.,\nDefendants.\nTERIVnNATTON PLAN -  PART [\nThe undersigned parties hereby agree as follows:\nI.  The parties have developed the following \"road map\" ('Termination Plan\").  This\nPan I covers the system wide issues of medical care, mental health (including substance abuse\ntreatment), and special education, and die PNM issues of inmate activity, administrative\nsegregation, legal access, food service, and living conditions.  Part H addresses the remaining\nextant issues in this case.\n2.  The Termination Plan provides definitive, specific, aad measurable tasks to be\naccomplished in order to achieve substantial compliance.  The areas covered in Part I include\nmedical care, mental health, special education, substance abuse treatment, food service, and\nliving conditions.  For these areas. Part I of the Termination Plan is comprehensive with respect\nto actions needed to achieve substantial compliance, with the exception of fire safety in the area\nof living conditions, and with the further exception of outpatient ambulatory mental health care\nand subject to final discussion regarding the scope of auditing in mental health. Moreover, these\nexceptions will be addressed in Part II of the Termination plan.\n3.  Widi respect to inmate activity, administrative segregation, and legal access, this\nDuran v. Apodaca\n•1111III1\nPC-NM-001-046\n\nl  i  -7  i  I\nPart [ lists certain specific tasks that must be completed before a check out audit occurs.  Part H\nwill address the full scope of the obligations defendants must meet in these areas in connection\nwith substantial compliance and on which defendants will be audited in the check out audirs\ndescribed in Part II of this Termination Plan. For the areas of inmate activity,  administrative\nsegregation, and legal access, if defendants complete the obligations listed in this Part I and\nmaintain compliance with those obligations as well as chose described in Part n, they will have\nachieved and maintained substantial compliance.\n4.  Part H will describe with particularity defendants' obligations in all areas of the\ncase not addressed in Part I {e.g., inmate discipline).  It also will address the full scope of\ndefendants' obligations in areas as to which this Part 1 is noc comprehensive (inmate activity,\nlegal access, and administrative segregation).  Finally, Part II will set forth, area by area, the\nscope and methodology for check out audits and for self monitoring in all areas covered in the\nTermination Plan except medical care.v  If the check out audits rind that defendants have\nachieved and/or maintained substantial compliance, which is to say that defendants have\naccomplished the tasks required by the Termination Plan and that no back sliding (as that term is\ndefined below) has occurred in areas in which a finding of substantial compliance has been\nmade, the parties, subject to the terms of paragraph 8 of this preliminary statement, will file a\njoint motion to vacate.\n5.  Plaintiffs' purposes in this process are to ensure a fair and reasonable check out\naudit in each area of the case, to ensure that a finding of substantial compliance is meaningful,\nand to identify areas, if any, in which back sliding has occurred so that appropriate corrective\nThese matters with respect to medical care are fully addressed in Exhibit A to Part I.\n2\n\nU  V \"• A i.\naction can be taken (including corrective action that may require a request for the appropriation\nof additional resources by the 1993 legislature) prior to vacating the areas of the case covered by\nthe Termination Plan in 1998.\n6.  Defendants' purposes in this process are to know exactly what must be done to\nachieve substantial compliance, to understand what elements of their obligations will be audited\nand how those audits will be conducted, and to have their obligations described specifically and\nclearly enough to have their compliance accurately and objectively measured.\n7.  If a check out audit or a self monitoring report reflects that an area is not in\nsubstantial compliance (due to failure to accomplish the tasks described in the Tennination Plan\nor due to back sliding) defendants will have a period of thirty days to cure that deficiency.  If\ndefendants determine that more than thirty days are required to correct the denciency, they win\ninform the special master of the reasons for the need to take longer than tbiny days and the\namount of time needed to correct the deficiency.\n3.  Defendants intend to achieve subs-.zr.tial compliance during 1997. If the check\nou: audits reflect substantial compliance or no back sliding (as appropriate) and the •self-\nmonitoring in each area that occurs after the check out audit reflects continued compliance, no\nlater than November 1,1998 the parties will file a joint morion asking the court to enter an order\nby December 31,1998 vacating all orders covered ta the Terminatioa Plan; provided, however,\nthat defendants will conduct their normal self monitoring in November 1998 and will forward the\nreports of that self monitoring to the special master, provided further, that the order vacating all\norders covered in the Termination Plan will not be entered until the special master certifies to the\ncourt that the November 1998 self monitoring report reflects substantial compliance. The special\n\nMaster will confer with both parties prior to making that certification.\n9.  The parties agree and acknowledge that in some instances the provisions of the\nTermination Plan modify the modification and termination provisions of the Modified Decree,\nand that a Rule 23(e) process may be required.\n10.  Defendants will not file a motion pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act as\nto Termination Plan issues prior to December 31,1998 unless plaintiffs file a motion for\ncontempt as to, or object to a recommendation for vacation of, an issue covered by the\nTermination Plan, by its terms or with respect to which the special master specifically has\nrecommended vacation of the Decree, either generally or in a particular area. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, defendants may file a motion pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act if the\nspecial master makes a finding that defendants have failed to achieve substantial compliance in\nan area and that this failure was the direct result of circumstances caused by inmates that made\nsubstantial compliance impossible, extraordinarily difficult, or infeasible.\n11.  The following definitions apply in this Termination Plan:\ncheck out audit -  the audit to be conducted in each area, each of which is described in Part (I of the\nTermination Plan; if defendants have achieved substantial compliance or they have\nmaintained substantial compliance (it. no back sliding}, the audit report will note that\nfinding and will initiate the self-monitoring for that area, the scope and methodology of\nwhich are described in Part (I of the Termination Plan; provided, however, that the\nreport may amend the plan for self-monitoring found in Part U in light of specific\nfindings made during the check out audit\ninmate, person\nincarcerated in\nNMCD, prisoner «  any member of the Duron class\nNMCD.

If the check out audits find that defendants have achieved and/or maintained\nsubstantial compliance with the Modified Decree in all areas, which is to say thac defendants\nhave achieved substantial compliance with the Termination Plan and that no back sliding (as that\nterm is defined in Pan I) has occurred in areas in which a finding of substantial compliance has\nbeen made, the parties, subject to the terms of paragraph 8 of Part!, will file a joint motion to\nvacate.\n4.  The check out audits will be organized and conducted by the special master during\n1997. In each area, until the check ou: audit is conducted defendants will continue to prepare and\ndistribute the Awaiting Seif Monitoring (\"ASM\") reports on the current basis and timerabte.\nexcept that ASM reports that are prepared monthly will be distributed monthly.\n5.  Prior to the completion of ihe final check out audit in the case, the parties will\nmeet at least quarterly with or without the special master, by telephone or in person,  co discuss\nthe ASM reports sr.d. :c discuss progress ar.d ccr.ZTTZS.  Evidence of Signtftcr:: concerns may\naffect the substance of or timetable for the check out audits.\n6.  Following each check out audit, the special master informally will discuss his\nfindings with the parties. If the finding is other than substantial compliance, the provisions of\nparagraph 7 of Part I will govern.\n7.  Once an area is found in substantial compliance after a check out audit,\ndefendants will begin self monitoring in thac area, using the self monitoring protocols included as\nappendices to this Pan II. The self monitoring reports will be distributed monthly.  The parties\nwill continue to meet at least quarterly with or without the special master, by telephone or in\nperson,  during the self monitoring period to discuss the self monitoring reports and to work\n\nMOv'-i  1- fc. i.C MM  i ri  r-*«\ncollegially to ensure that the Termination Plan process continues to {unction properly.  At any\nsuch meeting plaintiffs may provide evidence of back sliding in an area and request that the\nspecial master investigate the status of that area and informally report his findings to the parties.\nIn such case the special master will evaluate the evidence presented by plaintiffs to determine if\nan investigation would be appropriate (e.g., if the evidence appears to present credible concerns\nabout systemic, as opposed to episodic, back sliding). If the result of the investigation, if any, is\na finding by the special master that the area is not likely to be in substantial compliance in the\nlast quarter of 1998, he will discuss those findings with the parties and suggest to defendants\nsteps that could be taken to correct the back sliding and ensure that the area is in substantial\ncompliance in the last quarter of 1998.\n8.  Effective with the execution of this agreement and continuing until the vacation of\nthe orders as provided herein, plaintiffs' counsel will have access to the NMCD facilities on the\nsame basis and under the same agreements as are presently in effecL\nMark H.
