    "summary": "<p>On June 18, 1991, an inmate at the Rikers Island Correctional Facility (RICF) in New York filed a pro se lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Warden of RICF in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiff, who was later represented by the Legal Aid Society Prisoners' Rights Project of New York, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated when correctional officers beat him unconscious while he was in the facility's Central Punitive Segregation Unit (CPSU).</p><p>On February 18, 1993, the plaintiff's complaint was amended, naming additional corrections officers as defendants and additional inmates as plaintiffs.  A plaintiff class was then certified in the case, and the class alleged a pattern of brutality and the use of gratuitous and excessive physical violence by corrections officers and supervisory personnel.   The class was certified in May 1993.  </p><p>In March 1996, the City of New York moved the CPSU to a newer facility, called the Otis Bantum Correctional Center, where they installed video cameras and made other renovations.  The City also declined to represent or indemnify many of the named individual correction officers and supervisory personnel that were defendants in the lawsuit.  In April 1996, the City of New York and each of the named plaintiffs agreed to monetary amounts in full settlement of all claims for damages, and plaintiffs' counsel waived any claims for attorneys fees and costs.  There then followed factual discovery relating to the nature of injunctive relief to be sought from the Court on behalf of members of the class.  </p><p>On May 26, 1998, the parties entered into a 48-page Stipulation of Settlement (the \"Stipulation\") and on June 9, 1998, this Court ordered that the notice to the class of the proposed settlement be provided in English and Spanish to the plaintiff class.  The Court approved the settlement on July 10, 1998.  Two groups of correctional officers sought to intervene, to object to the settlement, but the Court rejected that effort on July 16, 1998.  1998 WL 397846.</p><p>The agreement dealt with use of force, staff training procedures, mental health services, inmate management, creation of an operating manual for the CPSU, use of chemical agents, staff placement, record keeping, investigation procedures, disciplinary procedures, and video coverage of inmate areas.  </p><p>The parties continued to file status reports with the court until July 2002, when the parties stipulated to the court that all issues had been resolved.  On July 18, 2002, the district court (Judge Patterson) thanked all parties for their cooperation and issued a final dismissal of the case.  210 F.Supp.2d 450</p>",

Thomas\nCenter (\"JATC\") on Rikers Island.\nAn amended complaint was filed, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties and an\norder of the Court, on February  18, 1993 seeking compensatory and punitive damages for  fifteen\npresent and former CPSU inmates from numerous officers,  uniformed supervisors and the City\nof New York to redress defendants'  alleged  violations of their rights under the United  States\nConstitution and the laws of the State of New York by subjecting each of the named  plaintiffs\nto excessive and unnecessary force while confined  in the CPSU in JATC.\nPlaintiffs  Michael Streeter and John Scott, on their own behalf and on behalf of\na  class  of  other  current  and  future  inmates  confined  in  the  CPSU,  sought  i!;claratory  and\ninjunctive relief against defendants Phoenix, Bird, Abate, Viera, Hopkins and the City of New\nYork to end the pattern of abuse and other misconduct by uniformed  staff  in the unit.\nThe amended complaint alleged that, over a period of years,  CPSU inmates had\nbeen subjected to excessive and unnecessary force, often leading to serious injury, and misuses\nof force were covered up by the falsification  of documents and in some cases che withholding\nof medical care by officers  and supervisors; that supervisors tnrough the ranks o¿ Uie Department\nof Correction had failed to implement effective  measures to curb the pattern of misconduct; that\nthe  system  for  investigating  uses  of  force  in  the  unit  and  for  disciplining  staff  members\nimplicated in these incidents was inadequate and ineffective;  and that the misconduct and failures\nin  supervision  and  oversight  were  so  longstanding,  deeply  embedded  and  widespread  as  to\namount  to  an  informal  policy  by  which  Department  staff  were  able  to  use  excessive  and\nunnecessary force against inmates in the CPSU without meaningful  disciplinary consequence.\n\nAll defendants answered the first and second amended complaints, and denied the\nmaterial  allegations  set  forth  therein.  Defendants  Phoenix,  Bird,  Kozack,  Viera,  Mitchell,\nHopkins,  Sielaff,  Abate  and  the  City  of  New  York  (\"the  supervisory  defendants\")  filed  an\nanswer on May 28, 1993; defendants Mojica, Davis, Matos, Day, Sartor, Gibbs, Capurro, Rohr,\nFroehlich,  Hatcher,  Mickel,  Figueroa,  Delgado  Athanassaiou,  Boyce,  Evans,  Hamilton,\nScaramuzzo, Moore, Guadagno, Martinez, Bianchi, Schollmeyer, Bailey, Litchfield,  Jorgenson\nand  Garcia filed an answer  on November  19,  1993.  The remaining  defendants  — Ancrum,\nArusano,  Bastian,  Cesario,  Chavers,  Coard,  Coxson,  Cruz,  Gumusdere,  Herrera,  Kounas,\nRosado,  Rose,  Stinnie,  Vasquez  and  Williams  — who  were  not  represented  by  the  Law\nDepartment,  filed  an  answer  and  cross-complaint  against  the  City  on  February  2,  1994.\nPlaintiffs  filed  a  second  amended  complaint  on  March  10,  1994,  identifying  a  number  of\ndefendants  previously  sued  as  \"John  Does.\"  These  defendants  — Brophy,  Capurro,  Glen,\nRamsey,  Matos,  Olivieri,  Ferrer,  Castella,  Cosolito,  Ketterer,  Davenport,  Peele,  Sheffey,\nSpissinger,  Washington and Whitfield  -– filed answers on March 31 (those represented by the\nLaw Department) and April 5,  1994 (those represented by private counsel).\nPlaintiffs and those defendants against whom üeciaraïory and mjunctive relief wer^\nsought (Phoenix, Bird, Abate, Viera, Hopkins and the City of New York) stipulated to the entry\nof an order granting class certification,  pursuant to rule 23(a)(b)(l) and (2) Fed.

Thomas  Center  and  transferred  the  plaintiff  class  to  a  new  CPSU  in  the  Otis  Bantum\nCorrectional Center (\"OBCC\").  The new unit is staffed  with officers and supervisors who had\nnot been assigned to the  CPSU in JATC, and is supervised by a Deputy Warden who reports\ndhcwu/ to the Warden of OBCC.\nThe Department previously  implemented systems for controlling and investigating\nuse of force  incidents, and  for disciplining correction staff  who have applied  unnecessary  or\nexcessive  force,  pursuant  to  the  decisions  of  the  United  States  District  Court  in Fisher  v.\nKoehler, 692 F. Supp. 1519 (S.D.N.Y.  1988), injunction entered, 718 F. Supp.  1111 (S.D.N.Y.\n1989), aff'd.,  902 F.2d 2 (2d Cir.  1990) and the consent judgments in Jackson  v.

Ward, 81 Civ.  101 (PNL)  (S.D.N.Y.\n1990).\nThe parties agree that the Court has jurisdiction over this action and the parties,\nand that the Court has the authority to order the relief set forth in this Stipulation.\nThe parties stipulate, based on the entire record, that the remedies set forth in this\nStipulation and Proposed  Order are narrowly drawn, extend no further  than necessary to correct\nviolations of the federal rights of the plaintiff class, and are the least intrusive means necessary\nto  accomplish  redress.  The  entire  record  on  which  this  stipulation  is  based  includes  the\n\nfollowing materials regarding the factual basis for the relief the parties agree should be entered:\nthe  lists,  charts,  and spreadsheets  which  summarize  voluminous  Department  of  Correction\nrecords,  and  which  are denominated  as Exhibits  1-7;  the documentary  exhibits,  deposition\nexcerpts and videotapes, which are denominated  as Exhibits  10-572, 600-663, 680-690, 700-\n1101,  1110-1278,  1300-1417,  1500-1860, 2000-2054, 2100-2166, 2300-2352, 2401-2478, 2500-\n2580, and 2600-2674; and the Rule 26 reports and depositions of plaintiffs'  experts Steve J.\nMartin, Vincent M. Nathan, Charles Montgomery and Isidore Mihalakis, M.D (report only).\nIT IS HEREBY  STIPULATED  AND AGREED by the parties that  plaintiffs'\nclaims for injunctive relief in this action shall be resolved without further litigation by the entry\nof a Final Judgment incorporating the terms of this Stipulation, following  its approval by the\nCourt after notice of its terms is provided to the class.\nThe parties stipulate as follows:\nUSE OF FORCE POLICY\n1.  The parties acknowledge that in the CPSU, the use of force by staff may\nbe required, among other reasons, to protect and insure the safety of staff,  inmates, and others,\nto prevent serious property damage, and to insure institutional safety  and security.  Recognizing\nthat there are limited circumstances where alternatives to force are not feasible,  staff  will be\nexpected  to handle  inmate  encounters  by making  reasonable efforts  to resolve  the situation\nwithout force or, when force is necessary, using only that amount of force necessary to restrain\nan inmate or to bring a situation under control.  The Department will direct and train staff to\nrespond to inmate misconduct without force, or if force is necessary, to utilize control techniques\nintended to minimize injuries to both inmates and staff.  Except in highly unusual circumstances,\nstaff will be expected to utilize appropriate force that is designed to control and immobilize the\n\ninmate  without the use  of tactics that carry  a high  risk of  injury  to  staff  and  inmates,  e.g.,\npunches,  kicks, strikes to vital areas of the body.  \"Highly unusual circumstances\"  are those\nwhere the facts and circumstances known to the staff member would warrant a person,  using\nsound correctional judgment, to reasonably believe such force is necessary, as a last resort, to\nprevent or  terminate  an escape  from  a correctional  facility  or from  custody  while  in transit\noutside the facility,  or similarly serious breaches of security, serious physical injury,  or property\ndamage  which  would  immediately  endanger  the  safety  of  staff,  inmates,  or  others.  The\nDepartment guidelines and any use of force guidelines specifically developed for the CPSU shall\nexplicitly  prohibit  the  use  of  excessive  or  unnecessary  force.  Staff  use  of  excessive  or\nunnecessary force, as defined  therein, shall be prohibited in the CPSU.\n2.  Within 60 days after this Stipulation is entered as an order of this Court,\ndefendants  shall develop  with the joint  expert  consultants  a CPSU  training  curriculum,  and\nwritten standards and procedures governing the use of force by correction staff  in the CPSU\nconsistent with the policy statement in paragraph  \"1.\"  The topics covered will include:\n•  when force may be used;\n•  the nature of minimal force; the nature of alternatives to the use of force;\nthe prohibition againi>i eAücSàive or unncccasai¯y force,  and the means fcr\navoiding  the  unnecessary  use  of  force,  as  set  forth  in  Department\nguidelines and in any use of force guidelines specifically  developed for the\nCPSU;\n•  control techniques intended to minimize injury to staff and inmates;\n•  the policy prohibiting the use of tactics which carry a high risk of  injury\nto staff  or inmates;\n•  when and how gas, batons, shields and s'nin equipment may properly be\nused;\n•  the policy regarding appropriate movement of CPSü  inmates;\n\nMental Health Services\n4.  As  of  the  date  this  Stipulation  is  entered  as  an  Order  of  the  Court,\ndefendants  shall maintain a written plan for the provision of mental health services to CPSU\ninmates.  This plan shall require that, among other things: (1) Mental Health Services shall be\ninformed whenever an inmate in special housing for mental observation has been charged with\nan infraction and shall be permitted to participate in the infraction  hearing, and to review any\npunitive measures to be taken.  No inmate from a mental observation unit shall be transferred\nto the CPSU without the authorization of Mental Health Services; (2) any inmate to be placed\nin the CPSU who is known to Mental Health Services shall have his chart reviewed and be seen\nby Mental Health Services staff before being housed in the CPSU; (3) all inmates in the CPSU\nshall be seen at least once each day  in their housing areas by medical staff,  who shall make\nreferrals to mental health services when appropriate; (4) observation aides shall be assigned on\nall tours, subject to the availability of appropriately qualified inmates, to each housing areas in\nthe CPSU, their presence shall be noted in area log books, and the CPSU Deputy Warden shall\nmaintain a written record indicating whenever an observation aide was not present in a CPSU\nhousing area; (5) inmates deemed by mental health staff to present a risk of mental or emotionai\ndeterioration if placed or continued to be confined  in the CPSU shall be removed from the Unit\nand placed in a more appropriate location.\n5.  Pursuant to the plan described immediately above, DOC and Mental Health\nServices shall, by the date this Stipulation is entered as an Order of the Court,  formulate:  (1)\na protocol for identifying, on an ongoing basis, specific CPSU inmates who should be removed\nfrom the CPSU for appropriate mental health evaluation in order to determine their suitability\nfor continued housing in the CPSü,  or to identify  alternative housing where they wiil receive\n\nthe  policy  requiring  the  utilization  of  handheld  video  cameras,  as\nreferenced  in this stipulation; and\nDepartment and institutional policy regarding cell extractions.\nINMATE  MANAGEMENT\nCPSU Operating Manual\n3.  Within 90 days from the date this Stipulation is entered as an Order of the\nCourt,  defendants  and  the  joint  expert  consultants  shall  develop,  and  defendants  shall\npromulgate,  a  revised  CPSU  Operating  Manual.  Prior  to  promulgation  of  the  Manual,\ndefendants shall provide a draft to plaintiffs'  counsel for review and comment.  This Manual\nshall set out, among other things: (1)  an explanation of staffing  patterns in the CPSU; (2) a\ndescription of the availability of correction counselors or social services personnel to the Unit;\n(3) a Use of Force Statement, which describes when and how force -  including chemical agents\n— may be utilized in the Unit, and how it is to be monitored and reported; (4) a description of\nany  incentive,  or  progressive  privilege,  program,  if  and  when  implemented,  to  encourage\npositive inmate behavior;  (5) a description of how services, including medical and mental health\nservices,  are  provided  to  CPSU  inmates;  (6)  a  description  of  a  housing  stratification  or\nclassification  plan,  if  and  when  established,  for  the  CPSU;  and  (7)  a  description  of  the\nmechanical  restraint  policy  applicable  to  CPSU  inmates,  including  a  description  of  the\ncircumstances in which inmates may challenge a restraint order and medical staff  may request\nexceptions to that policy.\n\nappropriate mental health services; (2) explicit criteria for removal of CPSU inmates for mental\nhealth evaluation and, when appropriate, treatment; and (3) an outline of mental health treatment\nmodalities available to inmates in the CPSU.\nChemical Agents\n6.  Staff  shall  not  use  chemical  agents  on  any  inmate  who  has  not  been\nmedically cleared for the use of such agents (because,  for example,  they suffer  from  certain\ncardiac or respiratory ailments), absent emergency circumstances, as defined herein.  When an\ninmate is admitted to the CPSU, medical staff  shall review his chart to determine whether there\nis a medical reason why chemical agents should not be used against the inmate.  Inmates who\nmedical staff have determined should not be the subject of chemical agent use will have their\nnames recorded by medical staff in a manner readily available to such staff for the purposes of\nthis paragraph.  Prior to the use of chemical agents, the person responsible for such use shall\nnotify  facility health services staff to determine from such staff whether there is a medical reason\nwhy chemical agents should not be used; provided, however, that no such notification must be\nmade,  nor  medical  clearance  for  the  use  of  chemical  agents  obtained,  in  emergency\ncircumstances when a delay in the use of such agents would present an immediate threat of death\nor serious injury, or would severely threaten the safety or security of the facility.\nPLACEMENT AND RETENTION OF UNIFORMED STAFF IN THE CENTRAL PUNITIVE\nSEGREGATION UNIT\nAssignment of Stair to the CPSU\n7.  The  Department  of  Correction  shall  assign  to  the  CPSU  captains  and\nassistant deputy wardens who have completed their post-promotion probationary periods.  Fifty\nper;cnt  of  corr·.;·.¯.tu`n OÎÏICCÍ^  a>sigíicu  co ùic  CPSU  .viali be  i.e.uüit:<.1, nu  more  ihan 25%  of\n\ncorrection officers  assigned to the CPSU shall be probationary officers  with less than one year\nof experience.  No housing area in the Unit shall be staffed on any tour solely by probationary\ncorrection  officers.\n8.  (a)  No officer  or supervisor shall be assigned to the CPSU against whom\nDepartment disciplinary charges are pending (whether or not the employee is suspended) arising\nfrom  a use of force  incident, or arising out of a breach of security resulting in injury  to staff or\ninmates.  In addition,  the Deputy  Commissioner  for  Investigations  and Trials  shall  carefully\nreview the circumstances of any other pending charges to determine whether the officer(s)  or\nsupervisor(s) charged should be assigned to the CPSU.\n(b)  In addition, the Department shall not assign any officer  or „^ervisor to the\nCPSU  who,  for  any  incident  that  occurred  in  the  ten-year  period  immediately  preceding\nconsideration  for  such assignment,  was  found  guilty  or pleaded  guilty  or no contest  to any\nviolation  in satisfaction  of  the  following  charges:  excessive,  impermissible,  or  unnecessary\nforce;  failure  to  supervise  in an  incident  that  resulted  in serious  injury  to  an  inmate;  false\nreporting or false statements; or failure  to report a use of force.  When an officer  was found\nguilty or pleaded guilty or no contest to any violation in satisfaction of the charge of failure to\naccurately  report,  the Department  will  specifically  review  the  file  to determine  whether  the\nreport contained a materially false  statement,  in which case the officer  will not be assigned to\nthe CPSU.  The Deputy Commissioner of Investigations shall carefully  review the circumstances\nof any other convictions or pleas to determine whether the subject officer(s)  should be assigned\nto the CPSU.  When an officer  with a history of convictions or pleas is determined appropriate\nfor assignment to the CPSU, a brief note shall be made in the screening report explaining the\nreasons for the assignment.  No officer  or supervisor shall be assigned to the CPSU, ü¯ ihe ¿íaff\n\nmember was employed  in the CPSU at JATC between June  1,  1989 and March 9,  1996.  No\nmember of the Emergency Services Unit (\"ESU\")  (formerly the Emergency Response Unit, or\n\"ERU\")  who was in the CPSU at JATC between June  1,  1989 and March 9,  1996 shall be\ndeployed in the Unit unless their use of force histories have been thoroughly reviewed  and their\ndeployment approved by the Investigations Division and the Inspector General.\n9.  Prior  to  the  transfer  of  any  officer  or  supervisor  to  the  CPSU,  the\nemployee's use of force history, as detailed in the material collected pursuant to 5003 for the\nprevious five year period,  shall be provided  to the  Office  of the Deputy  Commissioner  for\nInvestigations, together with a current and complete (career history rather than 12 month period)\nEmployee Performance Service Report (Foim 22R).  The 22R form must note all instances of\nthe staff member being referred  for use of force retraining pursuant to Directive 5003.\n10.  The Deputy Commissioner  for Investigations, or his/her designee,  shall\nensure that, prior to any staff  member's assignment to the CPSU, a thorough investigation is\nconducted  by both the Investigations Division and the Trials and Litigation  Division of each\ncandidate's use of force history.  The investigation shall include a written report (\"the screening\nreport\") detailing the staff  member's record of Department discipline,  including the dispositions\nof any charges and the reasons for the dispositions.\n11.  In  addition,  the  screening  report  shall  include  a  review  of  the  written\nreports  and  other  materials  included  in the  facility  use  of  force  package,  and  any  relevant\nInvestigations Division and Trials and Litigation files, for use of force  incidents in which the\nstaff member was involved during the preceding five years up to a maximum of ten incidents,\nas reflected  in the Directive 5003 data available at the member's previous commands.  For the\n\npurposes of this paragraph,  incidents examined will, to the extent feasible,  span the five year\nperiod under review.\n12.  The screening report prepared for each staff member being considered  for\nassignment to the CPSU, shall list in chronological order each use of force  incident reviewed\nin  accordance  with  Paragraph  \"11.\"  The  screening  report  shall  include  the  following\ninformation for each such use of force incident: the date of incident, the use of force number,\nwhether  the  incident  was  an  \"A\"  or  \"B\"  incident,  the  inmate's  name;  inmate  injuries  (as\nidentified  in the  facility  and/or  Investigation  Division  file);  how  did  inmate  incur  injuries,\naccording to staff (e.g.,  whether they were attributed to his striking a part of his body on a wall\nor Tiuur, or to being struck by a staff member); whether the inmate received medical services\nat a hospital;  a description  of  the  types  of  force  used  in the incident  by  all  staff  members\ninvolved including the candidate for transfer  (e.g.,  body holds, punches, baton thrusts, chemical\nagents, poly-carbon shields); the officer's post at the time of the incident (e.g.,  escort, housing\nofficer,  probe team, ESU); the nature of the staff  member's involvement (e.g.,  whether as a\nparticipant in the incident who used force,  or as a witness); the number of inmates and  staff\ninvolved; location of the incident (e.g.  inmate's cell, yard, corridor); whether the inmate was\nin mechanical restraints when force was applied; whether a supervisor was present when force\nwas applied; any command disciplines or memoranda of complaint recommended in connection\nwith the incident, as indicated in the files.\n13.  The individual conducting the review and writing the screening report shall\nwrite  a  brief  narrative  concerning  any  issues  reflecting  on  the  staff  member's  fitness  for\nassignment to the CPSU, including, when appropriate, the extent to which the member's use of\nforce reports conform  to the Department's report-writing policies.  The screening repon shall\n\nalso  indicate  whether  a  supervisor  has  recommended  that  the  staff  member  be  referred  for\nretraining in use of force.\n14.  The screening report  shall  include,  based on the staff  member's use of\nforce history and the member's employment history with the Department,  a recommendation by\nthe  Deputy  Commissioner  for  Investigations  as to the appropriateness  of the staff  member's\nassignment to the CPSU.  A list of candidates recommended by the Investigations Division will\nbe  forwarded  to  the  Inspector  General  for  recommendations  or  comments  regarding  the\ncandidate's  fitness  for  assignment  in  the  CPSU.  If  either  the  Deputy  Commissioner  for\nInvestigations and Trials or the Inspector General recommends that the candidate is not fit  for\nassignment to the CPSU, the candidate's name shall be removed from further  consideration.\n15.  A list of those staff members who are recommended for assignment to the\nCPSU shall be forwarded to the Office of the Chief of Department/UMAC.  For each uniformed\nmember  on this list,  all Directive 5003 print-outs,  the 22R and any and  all  Trials  Division\ncomputer  print-outs  reflecting  charges  of  any  nature  (and  dispositions)  brought  against  the\nindividual shall be provided to UMAC.  The Office  of the Chief of Department/UMAC shall\nconsider the materials provided  by the Investigations  Division and the member's  Department\nhistory  in determining  a staff  member's  fitness  for  assignment to the CPSU.  For those staff\nmembers recommended by the Chief of Department/UMAC  for assignment to the CPSU, the\nCommanding Officer  of OBCC will be provided with Form 22R, Directive 5003 printouts and\nInvestigation and Trials and Litigation printouts regarding the staff member.  This information\nis to be placed in the staff members' OBCC personnel  file.\n\nStaff  Orientation\n16.  All correction officers  and supervisory  staff  assigned to the CPSU  shall\nreceive an orientation by the Deputy Warden in charge of the CPSU before beginning work in\nthat unit.  At this orientation, staff newly assigned to the unit shall be provided with both written\nand verbal instructions regarding the procedures governing the use of force by correctional  staff\nin the CPSU, its monitoring and reporting, together with the relevant Department, facility and\nUnit orders and procedures with respect to the care, custody and control of CPSU inmates.\nTransfer of Staff from the CPSU\n17.  Any  officer  or supervisor  assigned to the CPSU and against whom the\nfollowing  Department  disciplinary  charges  are  lodged  (whether  or  not  the  employee  is\nsuspended) arising from a use of force incident shall be transferred from the CPSU:  excessive,\nimpermissible,  or unnecessary  force,  false  reporting or false statements,  failure  to supervise,\nfailure to employ an alternative to  force, and failure to report a use of force.  In addition, the\nDeputy Commissioner for Investigations and Trials, in consultation with the Warden of CPSU,\nshall carefully  review the circumstances of any other charges arising out of a use of force or\nother misconduct to determine whether the officer(s) charged should remain in the CPSU.  When\na decision is made to retain the officers  in the CPSU, the basis for such decision shall be noted.\n18.  Nothing  in  the  foregoing  paragraphs  shall  preclude  the  Chief  of  the\nDepartment  from  transferring  a  member  of  the uniformed  staff  from  the CPSU  to  another\ncommand whenever such a transfer  is deemed to be in the best interests of the Department.\nRecords of Litigation\n19.  The  parties  agree  that  the  disposition  of  litigation  against  individual\ncorrection officers and supervisory officials, the Department of Correction and the City of iSew\n\nYork  alleging  misconduct  in  connection  with  the  use  of  force  and/or  its  reporting,  or  in\nconnection with the care, custody and control of inmates, may contain information of value to\nthe Department  in evaluating the fitness of individual  staff  members to perform  duties in the\nCPSU.  The  Office  of  the Corporation  Counsel  shall  provide  to the  Legal  Division  of  the\nDepartment  of  Correction  information  reflecting  the  resolution  of  federal  litigation  against\nindividual  correction  officers,  supervisory  employees  and/or  the  Department  of  Correction\nand/or the City of New  York alleging unnecessary  or excessive use of force by  Department\nemployees assigned to the CPSU, or other misconduct which is alleged to have caused  injury\nto an inmate.

If the staff member's use of force history indicates that he/she\nhas  engaged  in conduct  in  connection  with  the  use  of  force  which  suggests  that  remedial\nmeasures should be undertaken,  the OBCC Warden or CPSU Deputy Warden  shall make an\nappropriate  recommendation,  including  the  referral  of  the  staff  member  for  retraining,  or a\nrequest that he/she be transferred  from  the CPSU.  Copies of the reports of these  interviews\nshall be forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner of Investigations and Trials.\n24.  The document reviews,  interviews and remedial recommendations,  if any,\nshall be memorialized  in writing,  and shall be considered by Department  supervisors  in any\nsubsequent use of force reviews.\n25.  Nothing in this Stipulation prevents facility supervisors, prior to the close\nof use of force investigations by CPSU-UFU,  from taking remedial action with respect to a staff\nmember whenever information obtained through facility review of use of force packages, weekly\nmeetings with UFU, or any other sources, indicates such action is appropriate.\n26.  All probationary correction officers assigned to the CPSU shall as part of\ntheir regularly scheduled employee evaluations be assessed to determine their continuing fitness\nfor assignment to the CPSU.  Supervisory evaluations shall be based upon both departmental\nperformance  standards  regarding  the  effective  care,  custody  and  control  of  inmates  and\ninformation obtained from any three-month use of force reviews.\nTRAINING\n27  Defendants  shall  provide  training  to  all  staff  members  assigned  to  the\nCPSU in topics, including but not limited to those set forth in Paragraphs  \"1\"  and \"2,\" above,\nas follows:\n\na.

The  Department  of  Correction  shall  not assign  a  correction  officer  or\ncaptain to the CPSU unless the staff member has been trained in the utilization of control holds\nand other forms of self-defense,  and has demonstrated a working knowledge of and thorough\nfamiliarity with these techniques.  All uniformed  staff assigned to the CPSU shall be required\nto  demonstrate  on  an  annual  basis  that  the>  have  a  working  knowledge  of  and  thorough\nfamiliarity  with the utilization of control holds and other forms of self-defense  as a condition of\ncontinued assignment to the Unit.\n\nCPSU USE OF FORCE - FACILITY  RESPONSIBILITIES\nUse of Force Reporting\n30.  When a use of force  occurs,  all staff  witnessing or participating  in the\nincident will be expected to write their reports immediately, except when doing so would have\na  significant  impact  on  the  operation  or  security  of  the jail.  The  reports  will  detail  their\nparticipation in the incident and what they observed and/or heard.  The use of force report form\nwill  be  revised  to  require  the  writer  to  report  only  information  from  their  own  personal\nknowledge of the incident: his or her actions, and his or her observations about the actions of\nothers during the incident.\n31.  Staff shall write their reports independently.  Whenever practicable, staff\nwill be directed  by  a  supervisor  to  write  their reports  in separate areas.  When  this  is not\npossible, the tour commander or, if he or she is unavailable, a designated captain who is not a\nwitness or participant,  will insure that information  is not shared and that reports are prepared\nindependently.\n32.  Staff claiming injury will be offered  the opportunity to be examined in the\nfacility  clinic.  If the staff member refuses the examination, a supervisor will note the  refusal\nin writing, and the note will be included in the use of force package.\n33.  Inmates involved in use of force incidents shall be escorted to the clinic\nfor  medical  examination  immediately  after  an  incident,  consistent  with  any  separation  or\ndecontamination  requirements, by a staff  member who was not involved  in the incident as a\nparticipant or a witness.\n\n34.  Whenever staff or inmates arrive at the clinic an entry shall be made in a\nlog indicating the time of their arrival. Reports of medical examinations shall include the time\nwhen the individual was examined by medical personnel.\n35.  A CPSU  supervisor  of the rank of ADW or higher  who  was neither a\nwitness nor a participant, or a UFU investigator, shall be responsible for interviewing, as soon\nas medically practicable, any officers  who are injured and unable to write reports themselves.\nThis supervisor  shall reduce the substance of the interview  to writing,  acknowledged  by the\nofficer  in the presence of the supervisor who will subscribe a statement on the document giving\nthe reason(s) for the use of this method, and will sign, and note the date and time.  If an oral\nstatement is not ootained, the supervisor ¿hall provide a written explanation of the reason.\n36.  When a use of force occurs, the Tour Commander will assign a Captain\nwho was neither a witness nor a participant in the incident to assemble the use of force package,\nas described  in paragraph  \"42.\"  The Captain will review the reports promptly to ensure that\nthey have been submitted by all staff participants and witnesses. The package will be forwarded\nto the Tour Commander who will review the reports to insure that they are complete, and that\nmedical  treatment  was  provided  in  a  timely  fashion.  Where  clarification  or  additional\ninformation appears necessary, the Tour Commander will note those issues in writing.  At the\nTour Commander's option, the Tour Commander may call the staff  member for an interview\nregarding those specific issues and note the responses.  In addition, the Tour Commander will\nbe expected to identify  any issues that should be brought to the attention of the CPSU Deputy\nWarden,  including whether his review revealed any possible violations of any institutional or\nDepartmental rules, orders or policies.  The  Tour Commander will then forward  the package\nto the Deputy Warden for CPSU who will review the package together with any video tapes of\n\nthe  incident.  The Deputy Warden will note issues which should be brought  to the Warden's\nattention and forward the package to the Warden.  Reviews by the Tour Commander and Deputy\nWarden, together with any notes of their review, will be included in the use of force package.\nCompleted packages will be forwarded to CPSU-UFU within seven days of the incident.\n37.

When the Warden or his designee or the Investigation Division deems it\nappropriate the following steps will be taken:  After a use of force, the location or the incident\nwill be secured (cordoned off) until it can be examined and photographed, and any evidence can\nbe collected by the ICO or UFU staff.  If the area is not covered by the wall mounted cameras,\nan officer  shall be posted to guard the area until  the examination can occur.  The area  will\nremain secure until UFU staff indicates that all evidence has been collected.\n39.  A staff  member who was neither a witness nor a participant,  will take\nclear,  color,  close-up photographs  of  inmates  and staff  of all areas of  injury  as soon as the\ninjured party is escorted to the clinic.  (Failure to properly photograph will be investigated and,\nwhen appropriate, disciplinary action will be taken.)  A sufficient  number of working cameras\nand supply of film shall be maintained in the CPSU and main clinics.\n40.  The photographs of the area of the incident and of the participants will be\nmarked to include the name(s) of the subject(s), time, date, and location of the photograph and\nthe  name  of  the  photographer.

Defendants  shall  ensure  that  a  sufficient  number  of  hand-held  video\ncameras  are  provided  to  CPSU  staff  to perform  the  following:  record  all encounters  held\nbetween CPSU inmates and uniformed staff in which the use of force is reasonably anticipated,\nincluding but not limited to those situations in which an inmate refuses  to submit to a search, in\nhis cell or elsewhere in the unit, or refuses to enter or leave a cell, or refuses to comply with\nan order; to record all cell extractions, including those conducted by the ESU.  In addition, the\nDepartment shall continuously record non-routine movements of CPSU inmates from their cells\nto an area not covered  by the wall-mounted  cameras.  (For the purposes  of this paragraph,\n\"routine movement\"  is understood to mean movement of inmates to programs and services.)\nThe movement of any CPSU inmate to and from the OBCC Main Intake shall be videotaped by\na handheld camera.  Nothing in this paragraph shall require staff to wait for the provision of\na handheld  video camera  where  safety  or  security  concerns require  an  immediate  response.\nHowever,  as soon as circumstances permit,  a vi^eo camera shall be utilized  to film  inmate\nmovement as required by this paragraph.\n86.  Defendants will revise Command Level Order 61/96, subject to review and\napproval by the joint expert consultants, within 30 days of the date this Stipulation and Order\nis  signed  by  the  Court,  to  include  examples  of  anticipated  uses  of  force,  including  cell\nextractions, and to require that after an incident is terminated the hand-held camera be utilized\nto do a full  body  scan of the inmate to record his physical condition.  Order 61/96 will also\nrequire that when CPSU inmates are transferred to an area that is not covered by wall-mounted\n\nvideo cameras (e.g.,  the Main OBCC intake, the Main OBCC clinic), the entire transfer will be\nrecorded on a hand-held video camera.\n87.  Order 61/96 shall also require that video taping of an anticipated use of\nforce (including cell extractions) shall include:  pointing and focusing the camera in a manner\nthat records, to the greatest extent possible, a full picture of the inmate and officers, and taping\nprior to the initiation of the incident and continuing through the remainder of the incident;  e.g.\nutilization of gas orior to entrv, all in-cell activity beginning from  the time the cell is opened\nthrough the inmate's being escorted to the clinic or to intake.  If the assigned camera operator\nfails to record an anticipated use of force properly, this failure will be investigated and, when\nappropriate, disciplinary action taken.\nTHE PARTIES' JOINT EXPERT CONSULTANTS\n88.

Between 1990 and 1996, 346 CPSU inmates suffered severe facial and head \ninjuries in “use of force” incidents. \n \n \n5  The Stipulation requires the CPSU staff to be trained in control holds and other forms of self defense to permit them to carry out \nthe current policy contained in Department Directive # 5005. \n \n \n6  The Stipulation provides for medical staff to review an inmate’s medical record upon admission to the CPSU for cardiac or \nrespiratory illness so that there should be no delay in responding to inquiry by staff prior to the use of gas. \n \n \n7  Departmental records discovered in this litigation document that many inmates have been gassed while locked in their cells, or \nwhile  handcuffed  behind  their  backs,  and  oral  discovery  developed  that  supervisors  had  conflicting  perceptions  of  the \n \nDepartment’s policy. In 1996 alone, forty-six use of force incidents were reported in which chemical agents and no other force was \nused, including at least one incident involving an inmate returning from hospital treatment for asthma. \n \n8  With the exception of access to personnel files, the Department has over the years promulgated and revised various directives and \norders which address all of the above aspects of its operation. Specifically, the Department has promulgated written policies \n \nconcerning use of force (Directive # 5005), administration of chemical agents (Directive # 4510RR), investigation of use of force \n(Directives # 7001, # 7002), monitoring use of force (Directive # 5003), discipline of staff (Directive # 7502R) and disciplinary \npenalty schedules (# Directive 4257R). Operations Order 14/91 provides that “work performance” and “special skills” be \nconsidered, together with seniority and attendance, when filling job assignments in a jail. Operations Order 4/94 sets out a policy \nand procedure for screening candidates for assignment to the CPSU based on their use of force activity, and for monitoring their \nuse of force history after assignment. (Chasen Decl. ¶ 39). \n \n9  In Blackburne, a state employee was terminated when he ran for public office. The employee claimed that his termination was in \nviolation of the disciplinary procedures contained in his collective bargaining agreement and sought arbitration, which was the \n \ncontractual remedy for claimed violations of the agreement’s provisions. The Court of Appeals held that public policy precluded \narbitration because the state agency accepted federal funds and thus was subject to the provisions of the Hatch Act: \nThe Hatch Act’s mandate that the State employer either rid itself of politicians or lose Federal funds embodies an important \npublic policy that can only be effectuated by a sovereign determination.... As a matter of law, violations of the Hatch Act are \npunishable by either the employee’s removal from employment or the employer’s loss of Federal funds.... To permit an \narbitrator to elect between these two options would amount to an impermissible delegation of the sovereign authority to \nprocure, allocate and disburse Federal funds invested in the [State] Commissioner. \nId. at 163–64 (citations omitted). \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  7 \n ",

PATTERSON, JR., District Judge.\nOn May 7, 2002, plaintiffs' counsel agreed that the Stipulation herein constituting a consent decree be terminated\nby the Court and the action be dismissed. This opinion and order is being issued because of the Court's\nconclusion that a record should be made of the manner in which the parties to this action, and particularly their\ncounsel, cooperated to negotiate a detailed consent decree, and, then, to implement the terms of that decree with\nthe result that an institutional change benefitting both parties was effected in the Central Punitive Segregation\n[1]\nUnit (the \"CPSU\"), of the Department of Correction (\"DOC\") at Rikers Island.\nSteve J. Martin, an expert on penal institutions with many years of experience in the State of Texas correctional\nsystem, described the use of force on inmates housed in the CPSU in late 1996:\n[T]he sheer number of serious incidents (multiple and serious injuries to inmates) that are\ndisproportionate to the threat of harm to staff (because the inmates are either unarmed, restrained\nor locked securely in a cell) is un-precedented in my experience ... Multiple head injuries\nsustained by inmates in routine applications of force in the CPSU [are] so commonplace as to\nconstitute a clear pattern and practice of employing techniques intended to harm rather than\nrestrain and control inmates ... The evidence of a pattern of excessive and unnecessary force in\n\nthe CPSU from 1988 to 1996 represents the most uniform and prodigious body of evidence, from\nthe highest levels of the Department to the line level staff in the CPSU, I've encountered in my\ncareer.\n(Plaintiffs' Report to the Court on the Stipulation of Settlement dated March 21, 2002, p. 2.)\nBackground\nOver ten years ago, Ahmed Sheppard filed a pro se complaint against Andrew Phoenix, Warden of the James A.\nThomas Center at the Rikers Island Correctional Facility of the City of New York, charging that on July 30, 1990,\nwhile he was an inmate in the CPSU, correction officers had beaten him unconscious. In February 1993, the\nPrisoners' Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society by Jonathan S. Chasan, Esq., filed a notice of appearance in\nthe action on behalf of Mr. Sheppard, as well as a stipulated order permitting amendment of the complaint and\nadditional plaintiffs to be joined. An Amended Complaint was filed, naming additional plaintiffs and individual\ncorrection officers as defendants. By stipulation and order signed by Judge Leval, a class action was certified on\nbehalf of fifteen inmates of the CPSU, charging a pattern of brutality and the use of gratuitous and excessive\n[2]\nphysical violence by correction officers and supervisory personnel.\n452 *452 In March 1996, the City of New York moved the CPSU to a much newer facility, the Otis Bantum\nCorrectional Center, installed 337 wall mounted video cameras, and made other renovations. In 1996, the City\ndeclined to represent and to indemnify many of the named individual correction officers and supervisory\npersonnel. In April 1996, the City of New York and each of the named plaintiffs agreed to monetary amounts in\nfull settlement of all claims for damages, and plaintiffs' counsel waived any claims for attorneys fees and costs.\nThere then followed fact discovery relating to the nature of injunctive relief to be sought from the Court on behalf\nof members of the class. That discovery was referred to Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger.\nOn January 6, 1998, trial was set for May 4, 1998. On March 16, 1998, the City reported that settlement\nnegotiations were progressing and requested an extension of time to file the pretrial order in view of the\nsettlement negotiations relating to the notice of the equitable relief sought. Thereafter, several pretrial\nconferences were held in April, May and June 1998, as a result of which plaintiffs' counsel caused notices of the\nterms of settlement to be served on, and discussed with, each inmate of the CPSU. On July 10, 1998, a\nStipulation and Order of Settlement (the \"Stipulation\") was signed. On July 16, 1998, motions to intervene by the\nCorrection Officers Benevolent Association and Correction Captains Association were denied.\nThe Structure of the Stipulation\nUnder the terms of the Stipulation, joint expert consultants, Norman A. Carlson, former director for 17 years of the\nUnited States Bureau of Prisons, and Steve J. Martin, were appointed to assist the DOC in formulating written\nstandards and procedures governing the use of force, nature of training and operations manuals, and to conduct\nsite visits to assess compliance with the Stipulation.\nThe Stipulation, drawn by counsel for both plaintiffs and the City, was structured such that the role of the experts\nas consultants to the DOC was as important as their role as monitors of compliance. Thus, both the DOC and the\nconsultants were able to assess what policies and procedures furthered the goals of the Stipulation, not merely to\nassess what was required by each of its paragraphs. The Stipulation was drawn to comply with 18 U.S.C. § 362\n(a) and required the DOC to develop a use of force policy, under which CPSU staff were to be directed and\ntrained to respond to inmate misconduct without force or, if force was necessary, to utilize control techniques,\nincluding force and chemical agents, in ways that minimize injuries to both inmates and staff.\nAs described by the City's letter to the Court dated March 27, 2002, the Stipulation, having been the joint effort of\ncounsel for plaintiffs and defendants, was implemented to achieve its goals, not to restrict it to its exact terms.\nThe overall goal of the Stipulation was to create and maintain a safer CPSU by reducing injurious\nuses force through clear policies, effective training and supervision, and timely imposition of\n\nappropriate disciplinary sanctions. The Stipulation comprises 104 paragraphs covering most\naspects of the operation of the CPSU, as well as investigations into uses of force and discipline of\nstaff found guilty of misconduct. Not only have defendants fully implemented the provisions of the\nStipulation, but DOC personnel, on their own and in conjunction with the expert consultants, have\nimplemented policies and management structures that have furthered the goals of the Stipulation\n453 even though not specifically *453 required by its terms. Likewise, the IG has played an oversight\nrole beyond that specified in the Stipulation, consistent with his responsibilities under the City\nCharter. In short, the success in the operation of the CPSU is not merely a function of specific\nprovisions of the Stipulation, but is more fundamentally a function of the commitment of DOC\npersonnel and the IG, assisted by the experts, to undertake the difficult work of institutional\nreform. In one sense, the specific provisions of the Stipulation, as well as key DOC initiatives that\nhave contributed to the goals of the Stipulation, discussed below, tell an important part 00 but only\n97\na part 00 of the success story of the CPSU.\n97\n(a) The Expert Consultants\nA key provision of the Stipulation required that the parties retain two expert consultants (\"joint\nexpert consultants\" or \"experts\"), Steve J. Martin and Norman Carlson, to \"assist them and the\nCourt in the implementation of this Stipulation and Order.\" Stipulation ¶ 88. Among other things,\nthe experts were to \"assess the adequacy of defendants' use of force policy, staffing and\nsupervision practices, training programs and any other practices addressed by this Stipulation and\nOrder ... make such recommendations to the parties as may be appropriate to insure compliance\nwith this Stipulation and Order; ... [and] submit written reports to the Court and the parties\nassessing compliance and whether compliance has been maintained for a substantial period of\ntime.\" Stipulation ¶¶ 91-92\nMr. Carlson and Mr. Martin are both correction professionals with the highest credentials. Mr.\nCarlson was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons for some 17 years and Mr. Martin has\nextensive experience in the Texas Department of Corrections. Both men have had experience as\ncourt-appointed monitors in systemic prison reform cases.\nThe provisions of the Stipulation were structured such that the role of the experts as consultants to\nthe Department was as important as their role as monitors of compliance. In this way, both DOC\nand the consultants were able to assess what policies and procedures furthered the goals of the\nStipulation, not merely what was required by each paragraph.\n(Defendants' Response to the Court's December 2001 Order dated March 27, 2002, at 1-2.)\nThe Stipulation Provisions and Compliance Initiatives\nDuring the first year of the Stipulation, and after extensive discussions with the experts, defendants promulgated\na new use of force policy, Directive 5006, consistent with the requirements of the Stipulation. (Stipulation ¶¶ 1-2.)\nDefendants also revised their training curriculum, again after discussions with the consultants, to make it\nconsistent with the new use of force policy and the requirements of the Stipulation. (Id. ¶¶ 1-2, 28.) Defendants\nalso promulgated a number of other documents required by the Stipulation, with input from the experts, including:\n00 A new CPSU Operating Manual (Stipulation ¶ 3)\n95\n00 A protocol for evaluating inmates' mental fitness for housing in CPSU and identifying alternative\n95\nhousing where necessary (Id. at ¶¶ 4-5)\n00 An institutional order requiring medical screening of inmates prior to the use of chemical agents.\n95\n(Id. at ¶ 6)\n454 00 A revised institutional order setting forth the requirements for the use of *454 hand-held video\n95\ncameras. (Id. at ¶¶ 86-87)\n\nDefendants implemented a detailed screening procedure for new CPSU staff, including independent approval of\nproposed staff by the Inspector General (\"IG\") (Stipulation ¶¶ 7-15) and implemented procedures to review staff\nperformance in the CPSU (Stipulation ¶¶ 22-24). Detailed protocols were established for the preparation of use of\nforce reports and use of force packages. (Stipulation ¶¶ 30-37.)\nIn addition to the training mandated by the Stipulation, the facility has been conducting on-site training since\nDecember 1999. These training sessions emphasize the adherence to DOC policies and procedures, including\nthe importance of using interpersonal skills, whenever possible, to avoid the use of force.\nIn their First Report dated February 4, 1999, (\"Report 1\") the experts acknowledged defendants' progress in\nimplementing the requirements of the Stipulation but made a number of operational recommendations which they\nbelieved would reduce force in the CPSU. (Report 1 at 26-28.) The experts specifically recommended that DOC:\n00 Adopt a unit management model, establishing the CPSU as a semi-autonomous command with\n95\nthe Deputy Warden as the unit manager, reporting directly to the facility warden. (Report 1 at 27.)\nDOC implemented this recommendation in June 1999.\n00 Move the offices of the Deputy Warden for CPSU out of the administrative wing of the facility\n95\nand into the CPSU itself to provide a constant management presence. (Report 1 at 27.) DOC\nimplemented this recommendation in June 1999.\n00 Assign a dedicated correction counselor to CPSU to assist inmates in resolving social service\n95\nissues such as child custody, employment, personal property and telephone calls. (Report 1 at\n27.) DOC implemented this recommendation in June 1999. More recently, the warden of OBCC\nassigned a uniformed staff member, as well, to conduct daily rounds in CPSU to facilitate service\ndelivery. (See Report 5 at 2.)\n00 Assign additional tour commanders to the CPSU so that there would be a dedicated tour\n95\ncommander in CPSU 24 hours a day, seven days a week. DOC implemented this\nrecommendation in June 1999.\nThe experts also recommended for inclusion in the draft operating manual received by them on December 3,\n1998, a progressive incentive privilege program and a housing stratification program. (Transcript of Hearing\ndated March 9, 1999 (\"Tr.\") at 6-9.).\nIn June 1999, DOC implemented an incentive system for CPSU inmates called the progressive inmate\ndisciplinary system (\"PIDS\"). The PIDS program is designed to encourage and reward positive inmate behavior.\nA PIDS officer identifies eligible inmates 00 those who have shown a positive progressive behavior pattern 00 on a\n97 97\ndaily basis. Inmates who qualify for PIDS are housed in a separate wing of the CPSU where they have the\nopportunity to earn progressive privileges such as additional commissary items, telephone calls, the use of a\nradio and, for those who have progressed through the various levels of the program, the possibility of conditional\nrelease from CPSU. The PIDS program has been exceptionally successful and consistently praised by the\nexperts. (Report 5 at 2-3.) The frequency of use of force in the PIDS unit is extremely low.\n455 An active cell study program has also been initiated at the CPSU. New admissions *455 to CPSU are\nencouraged to take advantage of the cell study adult education program offered in conjunction with Horizon\nAcademy. Inmates communicate directly with the director of Horizon Academy by telephone.\nThe most problematic and assaultive inmates have been relocated to the 3 South housing area. By limiting the\nnumber of inmates in this area to 20 or 25, staff are able to manage this population on a one-on-one basis.\nCertain inmates in this housing area, who have exhibited particularly assaultive behavior, are videotaped by\nhand-held camera whenever they are moved.\nIn response to repeated uses of force during escorts of inmates to various services, the escort procedure was\nrevised to require two officers to escort known problematic inmates. In response to several incidents where\ninmates who refused to walk were dragged, a procedure was implemented requiring the use of a Gurney when\ninmates refuse to walk. In an attempt to reduce the introduction of contraband into the facility by non-CPSU\n\nsentenced inmates who work in the Unit, all such inmate workers in the CPSU are now housed in CPSU. (Report\n5 at 3.)\nIn the first months after the Stipulation was so-ordered, a number of uses of force occurred when inmates refused\nto close their food slots and were extracted from their cells. This problem was addressed in several ways. To the\nextent that failure to close a food slot may have been an attempt by inmates to get attention for some real or\nperceived problem, the importance of service delivery and interpersonal skills was emphasized with staff. In\naddition, a dedicated correction counselor was assigned to CPSU to address inmates' social service issues.\nThose inmates who continued to refuse to close their food slots were placed in cells equipped with specially\ndesigned food boxes that minimize contact between staff and inmates. In their Second Report, dated September\n28, 1999 (\"Report 2\"), the experts reported that uses of force due to food slot incidents had been all but\neliminated. (Report 2 at 37.)\nAs the experts have noted, now when violations of policy and procedure occur, the facility administration has\nbeen quick to respond. (Report 5 at 4.) In response to an inmate suicide in January, 2002 00 the first during the\n97\nlife of the Stipulation 00 disciplinary action was immediately taken as soon as it was learned that existing\n97\nprocedures were violated, even though the inmate apparently had no mental health history indicating that he was\na suicide risk. (Id.) In addition, the procedures were changed to require that tour commanders make two tours\ndaily of all housing areas.\nThese examples by DOC administrators demonstrate the defendants' commitment to furthering the goals of the\nStipulation and to ensuring, through intensive supervision and training, that these policies and procedures are\nimplemented.\nThe Inspector General (\"IG\") for DOC has two responsibilities under the provisions of the Stipulation; (1) he is to\nreview the list of candidates for assignment to CPSU and recommend or comment on their fitness for the\nassignment (¶ 14); and (2) he is to review all negotiated pleas on CPSU disciplinary charges. (¶ 73)\nWholly apart from any obligation imposed by the Stipulation, the IG has undertaken to provide independent\noversight of the CPSU, consistent with his authority under the New York City Charter. See New York City Charter,\nCh. 34, § 805. His personnel conduct tours of the CPSU twice daily, review all use of force investigations, and\n456 identify institutional and disciplinary issues that need *456 attention. (Report 5 at 3, 9.) The experts have\nrecommended that the IG assess whether staff interviews, in connection with the investigation of use of force\nincidents, are necessary and have been conducted and whether the staff reports are complete and accurate.\n(Report 5 at 9.) The IG has agreed to perform these additional tasks and has been given the budget staff lines to\nassure that he will be able to do so as part of his general oversight responsibilities.\nDOC use of force investigations in CPSU had already been transferred from the facility to a special group of\ndedicated investigators, the CPSU use of force unit (\"CPSU-UFU\") under the supervision of the Deputy Director\nof Investigation (\"DDI\") by the time of the Stipulation. The Stipulation provided for the continuation of the CPSU-\nUFU and set forth additional requirements for the conduct of investigations. (Stipulation ¶¶ 46-50, 58-66.)\nThe Stipulation required that DOC maintain the wall mounted cameras and specified additional locations to be\n[3]\ncovered. (Stipulation ¶¶ 74-77.)  Monitors in the offices of the Warden and the Integrity Control Officer (\"ICO\")\npermit continuous live viewing of the video cameras' output. The Stipulation also sets forth a protocol for the\nreview and preservation of tapes recording any use of force. (Stipulation ¶¶ 80-82.)\nThe Stipulation also calls for the use of hand held video cameras to \"record all encounters held between CPSU\ninmates and uniformed staff in which the use of force is reasonably anticipated ...\" (Stipulation ¶ 85) DOC must\nmaintain sufficient hand held cameras and train officers in their use. (Stipulation ¶¶ 83-85.)\nThe cameras have shown themselves to benefit staff and inmates alike. All use of force investigations must\ninclude a detailed analysis of any video recordings of the incident. Facility management have extended the use of\nthe hand held cameras beyond the requirements of the Stipulation to include coverage of all movement for the\nCPSU's most problematic inmates.\n\nCPSU-UFU was initially mired in a backlog of old cases and the Stipulation required that investigation be\ncompleted within 60 days. DOC moved promptly to comply with its obligation to reduce the backlog of old cases\nand has reduced the length of time to disposition of all disciplinary charges against its personnel satisfactorily.\n00 In 1997, before the Stipulation, 218 cases were investigated and the average time to case\n95\nclosure was 252 days.\n00 In 1998, 479 cases were investigated and the average time to case closure was 62 days.\n95\n00 In 1999, 623 cases were investigated and the average time to case closure was 34 days.\n95\n00 In 2000, 518 cases were investigated and the average time to case closure was 38 days.\n95\n00 In 2001, 527 cases were investigated and the average time to case closure was 32 days.\n95\nThe experts' Reports noted that CPSU-UFU has significantly improved the quality and timeliness of its\ninvestigations and has \"generally established a record of substantiating the actual application of impermissible\n457 force when the evidence is there to do so.\" (Report 3 at 19.) The final *457 Report notes that this \"established\nrecord, when coupled with the clear pattern over the life of the Stipulation of less serious violations, represents a\nsignificant diminishing of serious injury laden incidents of force\". (Id.) Some concern over the quality of staff\nreports of uses of force has been expressed by the experts, as well as the need for broader staff interviews.\nHowever, they have also indicated that they are confident that the IG and his staff can provide adequate\noversight to address those concerns. (Report 5 at 9.) As noted above, the IG is already authorized by the City\nCharter to perform this kind of oversight, and has received additional staff to do so.\nAt the beginning of the Stipulation, the DOC Trials Division, responsible for prosecuting staff misconduct cases\nafter CPSU-UFU determines that misconduct should be charged, was confronting a chronic backlog of cases,\nmany which had been pending for years. The Stipulation imposed time frames for cases once they reached the\nTrials Division, and mandated that DOC, in consultation with the experts, develop penalty guidelines for force-\nrelated misconduct. (Stipulation ¶¶ 71-72.) In addition, it provides for review of all negotiated pleas by the IG.\n(Stipulation ¶ 73.) At the inception of the Stipulation, the average case took over 14 months to close. In February\n2000 there were over 100 pending CPSU cases, 80 of them more than a year old. By October 2000, there were\n55 pending CPSU cases. As of the writing of the experts final Report in January 2002, the backlog had been\neliminated; there were eight outstanding CPSU cases with only one case pending for more than a year. (Report 5\nat 8.) The average time to close a case is now under three months.\nAfter extensive discussion with the experts, defendants promulgated the first draft of the Penalty Guidelines\napplicable to DOC personnel in December 1999. After these guidelines had been in use, the experts requested\ncertain revisions and a second draft was promulgated and distributed to the Trials attorneys. The final version,\nincorporating additional recommendations of the experts, was promulgated in January 2002. (Report 5 at 8.) Well\nbefore the promulgation of that version, DOC had established a record of imposing tough disciplinary sanctions.\nMisconduct that in the early days of the Stipulation would have resulted in the loss of vacation days, now often\nresults in suspensions. (Report 5 at 8.) Recommendations of the IG for stiffer penalties in individual cases\nreviewed by that Office have been accepted. In one case, the Commissioner took the extraordinary step of\nrejecting the penalty recommendation of the administrative law judge for a 30-day suspension and instead\nimposed a 60-day suspension. (Id.)\nThe experts expressed confidence that: \"[w]ith the reduction in the huge backlog of cases, a mounting record of\nimposing more meaningful sanctions and the promulgation of an adequate set of penalty guidelines, there is now\na reasonable expectancy that violations, once established by the Investigations Division will result in timely and\nappropriate employee sanctions.\" (Report 5 at 8-9.)\nThree major concerns raised at the May 7, 2002 hearing were satisfactorily resolved:\n1. The annual introduction of new staff into the CPSU was accompanied by spikes in use of force\nand serious injuries. At the conference, the City reported it was aware of the problem and reported\nsatisfactory additional steps taken to prevent a recurrence;\n\n2. The long delay, until January 2002 in the adoption of the final version of the penalty guidelines\n458 for violations of the *458 rules governing use of force was troubling; however, interim versions of\nthe penalty guidelines had been satisfactorily utilized;\n3. The quality of the use of force investigations has been a continuing source of concern. At the\nMay 7, 2002 conference, however, the Inspector General, Michael Caruso, who is outside the\nDepartment of Correction chain of command and is employed by the City Department of\nInvestigation, reported that the City has given him the authority and awarded him additional\nresources so that the CPSU group in his agency will become directly involved in improving the\nquality of these investigations from the time of the incident through the time the discipline is\nimposed.\nThe Goals of the Stipulation Have Been Met\nIn their Fifth and final Report the experts emphasize defendants' sustained progress in implementing the terms of\nthe Stipulation: \"the last two reports reflected that facility management had made substantial progress in\ninstitutionalizing these important remedial measures.\" (emphasis added)(Report 5 at 1.) They note that the\npositive trends of reduced incidents involving serious injury and head strikes, reduced acts of self mutilation\ntogether with unprecedented levels of command discipline and the institution of procedures to safely and\neffectively manage the inmate population have continued and \"have now been in place for a substantial period of\ntime.\" (Report 5 at 2.)\nUses of force have generally declined in the unit and, most importantly, the numbers of Category \"A\" uses of\nforce representing the more serious type have become consistently low. In 1997, there were 252 cases of force\nreported in the CPSU, of which 177 were classified as Category A, and 75 were classified as Category B. In\n1998, there were 458 reported uses of force, 103 of which were classified as Category A and 355 of which were\nclassified as Category B. In 1999, a total of 618 uses of force were reported, 16 of which were Category A. In\n2000 the number declined to 518, six of which were Category A. In 2001, 15 of the total of 529 reported incidents\nwere Category A uses of force. The monthly average of uses of force for the last quarter of 2001 was 36, and for\nthe period from December 23, 2001 to January 25, 2002, the average was 28. (Report 5 at 2.) The experts note\nthat the 30 day period from December 23, 2001 to January 25, 2002 the average was 28, the lowest since\nmonitoring began in July 1998. (Report 5 at 2.)\nIn addition, incidents of inmate self mutilation have declined. In calendar year 2000, there were 247 cases of self\ninflicted wounds and in 2001 that number declined to 139. Moreover, inmate grievances have also declined. In\n2000, 220 inmate grievances were filed and in 2001 the number declined to 108.\nThe inmates of the CPSU have also benefitted. Not only are they the objects of fewer acts of force, they now\nhave the benefits of greater access to medical and mental health care professionals and a full-time counselor.\nFurthermore, they can utilize the progressive incentive program to get rewards, including possible transfer to\ngeneral population, for good behavior. The population of the CPSU has also been reduced to far fewer inmates,\npartly through use of the housing stratification program.\nMost importantly, for continued funding considerations, the City has benefitted financially. Fewer injurious uses of\nforce have translated into fewer officers taking sick days, which means attendant overtime costs and fewer\n459 workmen's compensation *459 claims. On June 12, 2002, the City provided the Court with estimates of cost\nsavings to the DOC as a result of the implementation of the provisions of the Stipulation, stating:\nIn calendar year 1997 (before the Stipulation was signed) the annualized Line Of Duty Injury\n(\"LODI\") sick rate was 6.21 days. Be calendar year 2001, the annualized LODI sick rate was\nvirtually cut in half to 3.26 days. Because of the way attendance is tracked and the fact that certain\nstaff work both in the main building and in the CPSU, this number represents the LODI sick rate\nfor all of OBCC, the facility where the CPSU is housed. The estimated savings simply for calendar\nyear 2001 as compared to the base year of 1997 is $878,162. The estimated cumulative savings\n\nfor the calendar years 1998 through 2001 is $2,753,560. The Workers compensation claims,\ncalculated for CPSU only, were reduced from 341 in calendar year 1998 to 129 in calendar year\n2001. Fewer injurious uses of force also yield a cost saving in fewer hospital runs. In calendar\nyear 1997 there were 136 hospital runs from CPSU. In calendar year 2001 the number of hospital\nruns was 26. The estimated cost savings for calendar year 2001 as compared to the base year\n1997 is $74,076. The estimated cumulative savings for the years 1998 through 2001 is $258,493.\n(Defendants' Letter dated June 12, 2002, at 1-2.)\nAs the City reported by its letter dated March 27, 2002:\nAs noted by the expert consultants, over the course of the settlement period, the CPSU has\nachieved an extraordinary level of professionalism and order. The reduction in the need for force\n00 and the resulting diminution in both the frequency and the severity of force used 00 is now a\n97 97\nmatter of record. With the use of inmate incentives, and the segregation of the most troubled\nCPSU inmates to their own unit within the CPSU, the inmate population is far more manageable\nthan at any other time in the history of the CPSU.\n* * * * * *\nA safer CPSU has greatly boosted staff morale. Because the CPSU now represents the highest\nlevels of professionalism, and because DOC has recognized excellent performance in the CPSU\nby promoting CPSU line and supervisory staff, there has been a tremendous improvement in staff\nmorale in the Unit. Rather than requesting transfers out of the Unit at the earliest opportunity, DOC\nstaff now request steady tours in the Unit 00 an unprecedented development. As a result of the\n97\ndesirability of this assignment, it is easier for DOC to recruit and retain the best qualified staff for\nthe Unit.\n(Defendants' Response to the Court's December 2001 Order dated March 27, 2002, at 13-14.)\nIn addition to the two expert consultants, Messrs. Carlson and Martin, whose expertise, as reported earlier, was\n[4]\ncrucial to the success of this consent decree,  much of the credit must go to the attorneys for the parties\ninvolved. Their combined actions showed not only attention to detail in crafting the Stipulation, but also diligence\n460 in overseeing its implementation in the highest tradition of the *460 legal profession. Plaintiffs were represented\nby Jonathan Chasan, Sarah Kerr, and Dale Wilkerson, staff counsel of the Legal Aid Society's Prisoners' Rights\nProject. Defendants were represented by Assistant Corporation Counsel Martha Calhoun and Jonathan Pines in\nthe Office of Michael D. Hess, then Corporation Counsel of the City of New York. Former Corporation Counsel\nPaul A. Crotty and Michael D. Hess oversaw the settlement negotiations and involved themselves at several\ncritical junctures in the course of negotiations. DOC in-house counsel were also very much involved in the\nnegotiation process, specifically Elizabeth Loconsolo, DOC General Counsel, and George Axelrod, then DOC\nSpecial Counsel.\nCredit must also go to then Department of Correction Commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, and to Mayor Rudolf\nGiuliani for voluntarily agreeing to this invasion into their executive domain. Commissioner Kerik and present\nCommissioner, William J. Fraser, have been equally active in implementing the changes recommended by the\nexpert consultants.\nIn addition to all of the individuals cited above, the following individuals deserve tremendous credit for the\nsuccessful implementation of the Sheppard settlement: Chief Leroy Grant (who was also Deputy Warden of the\nCPSU and Warden of OBCC); Warden James Barry, who was Deputy Warden and CPSU Unit Manager; Deputy\nWarden Michelle Mack, the current CPSU Unit Manager; Warden Mark Farsi, the current Warden of OBCC; DOC\nDeputy Commissioner for Trials and Investigations, Elmer Toro; DOC Deputy Directors of Investigation, Andrew\nKaufman and Adrian Lauriello; Integrity Control Officer, Dennis Wall; Deputy Warden, George Okata, who\noversaw the Trials Division, and from the Department of Investigation, Inspector General for DOC, Michael\nCaruso.\n\nIt is evident that the goals of the Stipulation have been accomplished and institutionalized and that there is no\n\"current and ongoing violation of the plaintiff class' constitutional rights.\" Moreover, the control mechanisms,\nincluding departmental and independent oversight, are in place to ensure continued safe operation of the CPSU.\nSince this opinion is being issued for whatever use it may have to others in the future, the Court notes that\ninstitutional change is not an easy task. Indeed, one of the experts stated after a recent conference that the\nprogress in the transformation of CPSU has been much faster that he would ever have guessed. In this case, it\ntook almost four years before all the pieces of the institutional reform were in place, and until there was some\nassurance that there would not be backsliding into past habits and mind sets. Now that the benefits of the\ninstitutional reform for all parties are apparent, it is hoped that what was learned will be expanded within DOC\nand that other institutions will adopt similar policies with similar results.\nThe reason for the invocation of this Court's equitable powers no longer existing, the Stipulation is terminated and\nthis case is dismissed with a salute of gratitude to all those whose dedicated efforts contributed so much to its\nsuccessful outcome.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] The Central Punitive Segregation Unit is comprised of those prisoners whom the DOC has found to be major\ndisciplinary problems and most difficult to handle.\n[2] Upon Judge Leval's being sworn in as a Judge of the Second Circuit in December 1993, the case was\nreassigned to this Judge.\n[3] As noted above, when the CPSU was moved from the old James A Thomas Center (\"JATC\") to the more\nmodern Otis Bantum Correctional Center in March 1996, DOC installed wall mounted time-lapse video cameras\nto provide round-the-clock camera coverage throughout the CPSU.\n[4] It would be remiss of the Court not to mention that Messrs. Carlson and Martin stated that the source of many\nof the techniques they introduced to the CPSU were those of my friend, the late Austin H. MacCormick,\nCommissioner of Corrections under Mayor LaGuardia, who remained active in corrections administration until his\ndeath.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

R. CIV. P.\n23(e)]\nDefendants.\nX\nJonathan S. Chasan declares pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 as follows:\n1. I am an attorney with the Prisoners' Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society, and together with my\ncolleagues Sarah Kerr and Dale A. Wilker, represent the fifteen named plaintiffs and the plaintiff\nclass in this action. I execute this Declaration in support of the application to the Court that it\napprove and enter as an order the Stipulation of Settlement (\"the Stipulation\") agreed to by the\nparties, and specifically to provide the Court with an understanding of how and to what extent the\nStipulation successfully resolves plaintiffs' claims. First, I have provided the Court with an\nexplanation of how the resolution of this litigation complies with the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct, 18 U.S.C. § 3626 et seq. Second, I have described the factual basis for the Stipulation~the\nrecord designated by the parties. Third, I have set out an outline of the issues raised in the\nlitigation, a summary of the history of the litigation, and a recitation of the relief secured by the\nStipulation. I believe that after reviewing the Stipulation and this Declaration, the Court will be\nsatisfied that the interests of the plaintiff class have been protected and substantially advanced by\nthe relief negotiated on its behalf. Assuming defendants' compliance with the terms of the\nStipulation, the parties' agreement holds out the substantial likelihood that the culture of\nuniformed staff brutality and cover-up in the New York City Department of Correction's Central\nPunitive Segregation Unit (\"the CPSU\") will be rooted out, and that the Unit will be run consistent\nwith constitutional mandates.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act  3\nThe Designated Record  3\nThe Commencement and Prosecution of the Litigation: 1993-96  4\nThe Relocation of the CPSU; The Parties' Abortive Efforts to Settle the Litigation; and\nthe Resumption of Discovery and Scheduling of the Case for Trial  10\nThe Pattern of Misconduct in the CPSU and the Systemic Failings Which Caused It  17\nThe CPSU at JATC: 1988-1996  Shieppnard v.

The Stipulation is consistent with the terms of the \"Prison Litigation Reform Act,\" 18 U.S.C.\n§3626 et seq. First, defendants have acknowledged that the relief to which they have agreed is\nrequired to redress violations of the plaintiff class' federal rights. Stipulation, page 4. Second,\ndefendants have conceded, and plaintiffs have agreed,\nbased on the entire record, that the remedies set forth in this Stipulation and Proposed Order are\nnarrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct violations of the federal rights of the\nplaintiff class, and are the least intrusive means necessary to accomplish redress.\nStipulation, page 4. Third, the parties have agreed that the Stipulation, once approved and entered as an\nOrder of the Court, shall remain in effect for at least two years. After two years, defendants may move\nthe Court to terminate relief, but the motion shall not be granted if the Court makes written findings\nbased on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation\nof the plaintiff class' constitutional rights, extends no further than is necessary to correct the violation of\nthose rights, and the Order is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means necessary to correct the\nviolation. Stipulation, ¶ 103; and see, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a), (b) (1), (3).\nThe Designated Record\n1.  \"The record\" documenting violation of the plaintiff class1 constitutional rights, and providing the\nfactual basis for the relief the parties agree should be ordered by the Court, has been jointly\ndesignated by the parties. This record consists of:\n2.  excerpts of 72 depositions of: CPSU officers; jail supervisors, including Wardens, Deputy\nWardens, Assistant Deputy Wardens and captains; the present Commissioner and three of his\npredecessors; Deputy Commissioners; Integrity Control Officers; Investigation Division\ninvestigators and supervisors;\n3.  lists of hundreds of inmates injured in the CPSU by staff in use of force incidents between 1990\nand 1995;\n4.  voluminous documentary exhibits including:\n5.  numerous Department memoranda,\n6.  facility records of over 626 use of force incidents in the CPSU between 1988 and 1996;\n7. 402 investigative files (which include facility use of force files) prepared by the Department of\nCorrection's Investigation Division concerning use of force incidents in the CPSU, as well as 168\nrecords of the Investigation Division's Incident Review Team (\"IRT\");\n8.  67 files reflecting the records of Department discipline prepared in connection with use of force\nincidents in the CPSU;\n9. charts and spreadsheets which summarize voluminous Department of Correction use of force,\ninvestigation and disciplinary activity;\n10. Department of Correction rules, regulations, orders and directives;\n11.  videotapes of use of force incidents and photographs of inmates injured by uniformed staff;\n12. trial and interview transcripts prepared in connection with criminal investigations and\nprosecutions of CPSU staff;\n13. the Rule 26, F. R. Civ. P. reports prepared by plaintiffs' expert witnesses, Vincent Nathan, Steve J.\nMartin, Charles Montgomery and Isidore Mihilakis, M.D., which were submitted to defendants on\nDecember 1, 1997; and the transcripts of the depositions of Messrs. Nathan, Martin and\nMontgomery, which were conducted in December, 1997.\n3 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nThe Commencement and Prosecution of the Litigation: 1993—6\n1. The amended complaint in this case was filed in February, 1993, asserting damage claims on\nbehalf of fifteen present and former CPSU inmates who alleged that they had been brutally beaten\nby CPSU staff in separate incidents between June, 1990 and December, 1992. (The original pro se\ncomplaint in this case was filed by Ahmed Sheppard in 1991.) The amended complaint also\nasserted on behalf of the class of inmates then or in the future housed in the CPSU claims for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief \"to end a pattern of unconstitutional and excessive force.\"\nDefendants in the damage claims included a number of correction officers and captains identified\nby name (50 officers and 10 captains were identified by name in plaintiffs' second amended\ncomplaint, filed on March 10, 1994), as well as the Warden of the jail in which the CPSU was\nlocated--the James A. Thomas Center (\"JATC\" or \"HDM\")-¯ the Deputy Warden in charge of the\nCPSU, the facility's Deputy Warden for Security, who supervised the Unit manager, the\nCommissioner, the Chief of Department, several of their predecessors in office, and the City of\nNew York. The claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were directed at the supervisory\ndefendants—the Commissioner, Chief of Department, Warden, Deputy Warden for Security and\nDeputy Warden in charge of the CPSU—who \"either authorized the beatings or failed to supervise\nthe CPSU staff in the face of a well-documented history of inmate abuse in the CPSU.\" Second\nAmended Complaint, ¶ 1. Plaintiffs' prayer for relief sought an order requiring these defendants to\nformulate a remedy to \"include measures which address the continuing deficiencies in selection,\ntraining, evaluation, supervision and command of the uniformed staff in the CPSU, and the\nDepartment's investigatory and disciplinary failures.\"\n2.  Each of the named plaintiffs alleged that he had been subjected to separate brutal beatings by\ngroups of uniformed staff members, that each of the beatings had been covered up by the\npreparation of false reports, and that these beatings were manifestations of a pattern and practice\nof misconduct by uniformed staff in the CPSU. These beatings were examples of a long-standing,\ndeeply embedded and widespread culture of brutality and violence in the Unit which was\nperpetrated by line staff and supervisors, and sanctioned up the chain of command. Specifically,\nplaintiffs alleged that:\n1. Members of the CPSU uniformed force engaged in a calculated effort to terrorize inmates by\nmisuse of physical force, the infliction of summary punishment, and the withholding of rights and\nprivileges guaranteed by prior orders of the Court (see, Benjamin vs. Malcolm, 75 Civ. 3073), the\nNew York City Board of Correction and the Constitution, including the deprivation of running\nwater in cells, access to the telephone and recreation;\n2.  Members of the CPSU uniformed force used force without justification against inmates to punish\nthem for minor misconduct or perceived disrespect towards staff, often beating inmates hours or\ndays after the initial contact. Some CPSU captains ordered or participated themselves in beating\ninmates, some stood by while officers beat inmates; some captains covered up the illegal conduct\nof their subordinates;\n3.  Members of the CPSU uniformed force subjected inmates to sadistic initiation rites when they\nentered the Unit, known as \"greeting beatings.\" Inmates subjected to these beatings were often\nthose who had been sentenced to punitive segregation for having assaulted staff in other jails;\n4.  Inmates targeted for abuse by members of the CPSU uniformed force were routinely beaten in\ntheir cells, or removed from their cells to isolated areas, such as strip search areas or stairwells,\nand beaten by groups of officers where there were no civilian or inmate witnesses. Many inmates\nwere beaten while naked;\n5.  Inmates beaten in the CPSU were often severely injured, and many suffered facial and other\nfractures, perforated eardrums and/or internal injuries;\n6.  Members of the CPSU uniformed staff routinely falsified documents to cover up inmate beatings,\nand in some cases simply failed to report any use of force. Some officers injured each other to\nsupport false claims that inmates had assaulted staff, and some staff members carried \"throw\ndown\" weapons which they falsely claimed the inmate possessed in order to justify the use of\nforce. Inmates who were beaten or who witnessed beatings were solicited by staff members to\nmake false statements about incidents, or to refrain from reporting injuries. Some inmates were\n4 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\noffered access to medical care or discharge from the CPSU in exchange for their cooperation.\n7.  Line officers in the CPSU were drawn disproportionately from recruit classes at the Department's\nTraining Academy;\n8.  Supervisors in the jail in which the CPSU was located, as well as high-ranking Department\nsupervisors, knew for years from a number of sources—including their own documents,\ncommunications from oversight agencies, inmate representatives and the United States District\nCourt's Office of Compliance Consultants—that there was an on-going pattern of physical abuse in\nthe CPSU, but these supervisors failed to take measures to curb the abuse. These supervisors\nfailed to ensure that competent, un-biased investigations of use of force incidents were conducted\nat both the facility and central office, and they failed or refused to subject staff members whose\nmisconduct was brought to the Department's attention to any meaningful disciplinary measures;\n9. The pattern of brutality and cover-up in the CPSU, the Department of Correction's failure to\nconduct unbiased investigations and to engage in meaningful discipline of staff, and the\nlong-standing failure of the Department to properly supervise the Unit were so institutionalized as\nto demonstrate a policy or custom that implicitly authorized and permitted the abuse of inmates in\nthe CPSU.\n1. Between 1993 and July, 1995, plaintiffs conducted extensive documentary and deposition\ndiscovery concerning the damage claims of the fifteen named plaintiffs. Much of the information\ngathered in this phase of discovery was highly probative of the supervisory failures of the CPSU,\nJATC and Department managers, and of the systemic character of the staff violence in the Unit.\nFor example, depositions of 42 correction officers who worked, or who had worked in the CPSU,\nproduced evidence of: officers' involvement in substantial numbers of use of force incidents under\ncircumstances strikingly similar to those involving the named plaintiffs; incidents which had been\nreported falsely; reports officers had signed but which had been written by other staff members;\nhighly suspicious staff injuries; and staff use of \"throw down\" weapons. The deposition of the\nfacility's Integrity Control Officer, Assistant Deputy Warden Gloria Hunter, similarly yielded\nsignificant testimony concerning the long-standing unwillingness of Department supervisors to\nconfront the evidence she had gathered concerning misuse of force in the Unit, and the failure of\nfacility supervisors to monitor staff use of force consistent with Department requirements.\n2.  Depositions often investigators and supervisors in the Department's Investigations Division\nproduced substantial evidence of the Department's long-standing failure to conduct competent,\nunbiased investigations into use of force incidents. These depositions demonstrated how poorly\ntrained and inadequately supervised most of these investigators were; how the Department's\ncentral office had at times actively impeded the conduct of use of force investigations; and how\nthe Division's disorganization and lack of automated resources prevented it from  effectively\ngathering information in any meaningful fashion.\n3.  In June and September, 1995 defendants requested that the noticed depositions of CPSU and\nJATC supervisors be adjourned while the City Law Department determined which of these\nindividuals it would decline to represent pursuant to General Municipal Law § 50-k. The statute (§\n50-k(5)) requires the City to represent its employees in civil actions \"arising out of any alleged act\nor omission which the corporation counsel finds occurred while the employee was acting within\nthe scope of his public employment and in the discharge of his duties and was not in violation of\nany rule or regulation of his agency at the time the alleged act or omission occurred.\" (The City\nhad declined to represent 21 correction officers at the commencement of the litigation, and these\nindividuals had been represented by counsel retained by their union, the Correctional Officers\nBenevolent Association (\"COBA\").) At the Court's suggestion, plaintiffs agreed to defer\nadditional depositions until the representation issue was resolved. In November, plaintiffs moved\nto disqualify Dienst and Serrins, newly retained counsel to the Correctional Officers' Benevolent\nAssociation, which had filed notices of substitution of attorney on behalf of the 21 officers who\nuntil then had been represented by COBA's prior counsel. The motion was based on the fact that\nRichard Koehler, former Commissioner of Correction, was of counsel to the Dienst office, was to\nbe called by plaintiffs as a fact witness, and his testimony was likely to be adverse to that of a\nnumber of CPSU officers who were to be represented by the firm. See, Plaintiffs' Motion to\nDisqualify Counsel (November 28, 1995). Shortly after argument on the motion on January 24,\n1996, the Dienst firm withdrew as counsel to these officers.\n4.  On January 23, 1996 the Law Department advised the Court and plaintiffs' counsel that the City\n5 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nhad declined to represent 23 additional defendants in the case. Plaintiffs' counsel was advised that\nthese defendants included Warden Phoenix, Deputy Wardens Bird and Kozack, Assistant Deputy\nWarden/CPSU Unit Manager Viera, six captains and twelve correction officers. In their January\n23 letter, the Law Department informed the Court that, \"in an effort to address the historical\nproblems at the CPSÛ that are the focus of this lawsuit, the New York City Department of\nCorrection is in the process of implementing a plan to move the CPSU from JATC to the Otis\nBantum Correctional Center [\"OBCC\"]. OBCC is a considerably more modern facility than JATC\nand the new unit will be completely covered by video cameras. In addition, DOC intends to\nremove all Sheppard defendants from the CPSU and to screen all new staff to prevent officers\nwith extensive use of force histories from being placed in the unit.\" Letter, Martha Calhoun to\nHon. Robert P. Patterson, Jr., January 23, 1996.\n5.  In February, 1996 the fifteen named plaintiffs settled their damage claims against the individual\ndefendants and the City for sums totaling $1.6 million, and these claims were dismissed on\nstipulation. See, Stipulation and Order, April 18, 1996.\nThe Relocation of the CPSU; The Parties' Abortive Efforts to Settle the Litigation; and the Resumption\nof Discovery and Scheduling of the Case for Trial\n1. On March 9, 1996 the Department of Correction relocated the CPSU from JATC to OBCC. At a\nstatus conference later that month, the City advised the Court that it was \"actively pursuing\"\nplaintiffs' proposal to settle the remaining injunctive claims, a proposal which addressed the\nsystemic deficiencies with respect to the use of force policy, training, supervision, investigation\nand discipline of officers who misused force.\n2.  Plaintiffs' counsel continued to monitor closely staff use of force in the Unit. In late April,\nplaintiffs counsel advised the Court that, notwithstanding the relocation of the Unit and the\nreplacement of its staff, \"we expect to prove that there has been, and still is, a pattern of misuse of\nforce in the CPSU, that this pattern has led to the infliction of serious injuries on large numbers of\ninmates, and it has persisted through a number of Department of Correction and facility\nadministrations. We likewise expect to prove that the pervasiveness of staff violence in the CPSU\nis a consequence of systemic deficiencies in staff selection, assignment, training, supervision,\ninvestigation and discipline.\" Letter, Jonathan S. Chasan to Hon. Robert P. Patterson, Jr., April 30,\n1996. Plaintiffs' counsel wrote to the Court concerning OBCC again, on May 20, 1996, that there\nwas \"no doubt that the infliction of serious injuries on class members, including some who were\nreportedly beaten over the head while handcuffed and others who were sprayed with chemical\nagents while cuffed, results from a continuation of the same systemic deficiencies in supervision,\ntraining, investigation and discipline of uniformed staff which gave rise to this lawsuit in 1993.\"\nLetter, Jonathan S. Chasan to Hon. Robert P. Patterson, May 20, 1996.\n3.  On May 23 and July 31, 1996, plaintiffs' counsel advised defendants' counsel by letter that a\npattern had already emerged in the OBCC CPSU of staff misuse of force: inmates were being\nbeaten while in handcuffs and in areas outside the range of wall-mounted video cameras; a number\nof inmates had been struck in the head and face and required hospital treatment for their injuries.\nLine staff and captains, who had been authorized to apply tear gas to inmates in the CPSU shortly\nafter the OBCC Unit opened, were gassing inmates—including inmates being treated by medical\nstaff for asthma— in situations where the use of chemical agents appeared unnecessary. See, infra,\n¶¶ 87-96.\n4.  On April 26, 1996, plaintiffs noticed additional depositions of JATC and Department of\nCorrection supervisory staff, including some which had first been noticed in 1995. Defendants\nobjected to plaintiffs' conducting additional discovery concerning the CPSU at JATC, and\ncontinued to trumpet the \"bold reforms\"—including the transfer of authority to investigate use of\nforce incidents in the CPSU from the Department of Correction to the Department of\nInvestigation-that they had initiated at OBCC as a measure of how unlikely plaintiffs' could\nsuccessfully litigate the injunctive claims in this litigation: \"Defendants submit that the new CPSU\nrepresents an improvement over the JATC CPSU by several orders of magnitude. Certainly, taken\ntogether, all of plaintiffs' concerns are a far cry from the concerns that led Legal Aid to assume\nresponsibility for the prosecution of Sheppard years ago. Indeed, with all their concerns about the\nnew CPSU, plaintiffs' counsel would be hard-pressed to find any plausible basis upon which to\n6 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\ncommence a Sheppard-stvle lawsuit based upon the conditions of confinement as they exist\ntoday.\" Letter, Jonathan Pines to Hon. Robert P. Patterson, Jr., May 1, 1996.\n5. At a conference on May 2, 1996, defendants' counsel advised the Court that the City was\nunwilling to enter into an enforceable remedial order, but was formulating a \"detailed operational\nplan\" in response to plaintiffs' proposals. At a May 21, 1996 conference, Corporation Counsel\nPaul Crotty informed the Court that notwithstanding the City's unwillingness to enter into a\ncourt-ordered remedial agreement, it would shortly share with plaintiffs' counsel an operational\nplan for the CPSU that included, as its cornerstone, the transfer of authority to investigate misuse\nof force from the Department of Correction to the Department of Investigation. That transfer was\nsupposed to be effective on July 1, 1996.\n6.  At the Court's suggestion, the parties attempted, during the spring and summer of 1996, to resolve\nthe injunctive claims. These efforts centered around the Court's proposal that the parties stipulate\nto facts, agree on the terms of an operational plan, and further agree that if the City refused to\ncomply with the terms of the operational plan, plaintiffs could enforce the plan on motion, relying\non the stipulated facts as the record of the litigation. Ultimately, the parties' efforts to resolve the\nlitigation failed, and the City withdrew its prior commitment to transfer authority to investigate\nuse of force in the CPSU from the Department of Correction to the Department of Investigation.\nOn February 7, 1997 the Court set a trial date for November 3, 1997; defendants consented to\nplaintiffs' proposal that proof at trial concerning incidents and events in the CPSU be limited to\nthose occurring before January 1, 1997.\n7. From October, 1996 through October, 1997 plaintiffs conducted depositions of a number of\ncurrent and former CPSU supervisors (captains and assistant deputy wardens) in JATC and\nOBCC, Wardens and Deputy Wardens assigned to JATC and OBCC, former Commissioners\nKoehler and Abate, the current and former Deputy Commissioners for Investigation and Trials,\nformer Directors and Deputy Directors of the Investigation Division's Use of Force Unit, Chief of\nDepartment Taylor (now retired), then-first Deputy (now Commissioner) Kerik and\nthen-Commissioner Jacobson. These depositions produced substantial evidence of these\nsupervisors' knowledge, over a period of years, of the pattern of misuse of force in the CPSU and\nof the inadequacy of their response to the misconduct. Depositions of the OBCC supervisors\nproduced evidence of the degree to which CPSU staff continued to resort to physical abuse as a\nform of management and control in the Unit. During this period, the defendants turned over a\nnumber of videotapes showing use of force incidents in the OBCC CPSU after plaintiffs\nsuccessfully moved to compel production in September, 1996. See, Memo Endorsement,\nSeptember 20, 1996.\n8.  In March, 1997, following the deposition of First Deputy Commissioner Kerik, the parties again\nentered into protracted negotiations towards a resolution of the injunctive claims. In July, 1997,\nhowever, plaintiffs' counsel was advised that defendants' counsel lacked authority to continue to\nnegotiate any resolution of the litigation. Pursuant to the Court's revised scheduling order, a March\n1, 1998 trial date was set. Plaintiffs' counsel drafted proposed stipulations of fact, which were\nsubmitted to defendants' counsel in October and November, 1997. On October 3, plaintiffs\nprovided counsel with a preliminary list of 33 inmate witnesses, which was modified on\nDecember 29, when plaintiffs' counsel designated 18 OBCC inmates as witnesses. Plaintiffs'\ncorrectional experts—Vincent M. Nathan, Steve J. Martin and Charles Montgomery—and forensic\npathologist, Isidore Mihalakis, M.D., submitted voluminous reports pursuant to F.R.Civ. P. 26(b)\nin early December, 1997. On December 1, plaintiffs designated for admission at trial videotapes of\n78 use of force incidents, all but four of which documented incidents in OBCC between March 9\nand December 11, 1996. The correctional experts were deposed later that month. Defendants did\nnot designate any expert witnesses for trial.\n9. In December, 1997 and again in January, 1998 defendants requested a two month adjournment of\nthe trial date. Plaintiffs initially opposed any adjournment, but consented after agreement had been\nreached in mid-January on many of the proposed stipulated facts. At the end of January,\ndefendants advised plaintiffs' counsel that they had been provided with authority to enter into a\ncourt-ordered settlement agreement. The parties then negotiated over the following three months\nthe terms of the Stipulation.\n1. Voluminous documentary and deposition testimony, much of which contained extraordinary\nadmissions by a number of Department of Correction employees, has been adduced in this\n7 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nlitigation concerning the CPSU at JATC, the CPSU at OBCC, the activities of the Department's\ncentral office Investigations Division and the Department of Correction's disciplinary process.\nThere have also been a number of criminal investigations and prosecutions by the United States\nDepartment of Justice, the New York City Department of Investigation/Inspector General for\nCorrection and the Bronx District Attorney of CPSU staff for assaults on inmates and falsification\nof official reports. These criminal proceedings have generated additional admissions and evidence\nof the pattern of wrongdoing in the Unit. Based on the Department's records, the deposition\ntestimony of current and former Department employees, the reports and depositions of plaintiffs'\nexperts, the anticipated trial testimony of plaintiffs' inmate witnesses, and the other evidence\ngathered in this litigation, it was plaintiffs' expectation that at trial they would be able to prove all\nof the allegations set out in the Amended Complaint.\n2.  Plaintiffs believe that the proof adduced in this litigation would have been sufficient for the Court\nto find that high-ranking Department of Correction supervisors were deliberately indifferent to the\nharm visited upon the plaintiff class in the CSPU, and thus violated their 14* Amendment rights\nto due process. Specifically, the evidence gathered in discovery and the record of this litigation\ndemonstrated that these defendants \"failed to act despite [their] knowledge of a substantial risk of\nserious harm\"; moreover, these defendants \"knew of a substantial risk\" of serious harm \"from the\nvery fact that the risk was obvious.\" Farmer v. Brennan. 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1981\n(1994); and see, Madrid v. Gomez, 889 F.Supp. 1146, 1246-47 (N.D.Cal. 1995) (deliberate\nindifference found when prison official knows of serious risk and fails to take reasonable\nmeasures to abate the risk). That these defendants turned a blind eye towards the overwhelming\nevidence of a pattern of brutality and cover up in the CPSU, and proclaimed for years that they\ncould never \"establish\" what others told them existed, and what they \"suspected,\" is no defense.\nSee, Vance v. Peters, 97 F.3d 987, 992-93 (7th Cir. 1996); Boyd v. Knox. 47 F.3d 966, 968 (8th\nCir. 1995); Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F.2d 985, 992-93 (7th Cir. 1988). These defendants\ncould not \"escape liability if the evidence showed that [they] merely refused to verify underlying\nfacts that [they] strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of risk that [they]\nstrongly suspected to exist.\" Farmer. 114 S.Ct. at 1982, n.8; see also, Madrid. 889 F.Supp at 1247;\nColeman vs. Wilson, 912 F.Supp. 1282, 1316-17 (E.D. Cal. 1995) (\"Moreover, after five years of\nlitigating, the claim of lack of awareness is not plausible, \")(citations omitted); McGill v.\nDuckworth, 944 F.2d 344, 351 (7th Cir. 1991) (\"Going out of your way to avoid acquiring\nunwelcome knowledge is a species of intent\") cert, denied, 503 U.S. 907, 112 S.Ct. 1265, 117\nL.Ed.2d 493). As we detail below, the overwhelming evidence of a pattern of brutality in the\nCPSU was over a period of years repeatedly placed before Department Commissioners and jail\nsupervisors, but they made no commitment to undertake reasonable measures to address the\nmisconduct until trial in this case was imminent.\n3.  The evidence in this case—of a pattern of unnecessary and excessive force directed against CPSU\ninmates, and that defendants, in permitting the pattern to develop and persist, acted with deliberate\nindifference— would have been sufficient to impose liability on these defendants. Madrid, 889\nF.Supp. at 1247-8. Defendants' consistent failure, over a period of years, to implement adequate\nsystems in training, investigation and discipline in order to control and regulate the use of force,\ndespite their knowledge that such systems were necessary to ensure that force was controlled in\nthe CPSU, is evidence of their deliberate indifference. Fisher v. Koehler, 692 F.Supp. 1519, 1564\n(S.D.N.Y. 1988), injunction entered, 718 F. Supp. 1111 (1989), affd,  902 F.2d 2 (2d Cir. 1990);\nMadrid. 889 F.Supp at 1251; Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F.Supp. 1265\n1302 (S.D.Tex. 1980) (prison officials encouraged staff to indulge in excessive physical violence by\nrarely investigating reports of violence and failing to take disciplinary action), affd in part, 679 F.2d\n1115 (5th Cir. 1982), amended in part, vacated in part on other grounds, 688 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1982),\ncert, denied, 460 U.S. 1042, 103 S.Ct. 1438, 75 L.Ed.2d 795 (1983).\n1. Plaintiffs' claim against the City would also have been successful in this case because the failure\nto train and supervise CPSU staff was so deficient as to evince a policy of deliberate indifference.\nCanton v. Harris. 489 U.S. 378, 390, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1205, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (l989)(\"[I]t may\nhappen that...the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to\nresult in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policy makers of the city can reasonably be\nsaid to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.\"); Ricciuti v. New York City Transit\n8 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nAuthority, 941 F.2d 119, 123 (2d Cir. 1991) (municipal policy of deliberate indifference may be\nshown by \"evidence that the municipality had notice of but repeatedly failed to make any\nmeaningful investigation into charges that police officers had used excessive force\"); Gentile v.\nCounty of Suffolk. 926 F.2d 142, 152-3 (2d Cir. 1991) (county liable based on policy of failure to\ndiscipline police officers).\nThe Pattern of Misconduct in the CPSU and the Systemic Failings Which Caused It\n1. From 1988 through 1996 there has been a clear pattern of Department of Correction staff using\nunnecessary and excessive force against inmates confined in the Department's Central Punitive\nSegregation Unit, and of staff covering up their misconduct. This pattern began when the CPSU\nwas located at the James A. Thomas Center, between March 1, 1988 and March 9, 1996, and\ncontinued after the Unit was relocated to the Otis Bantum Correctional Center on March 10, 1996.\nPlaintiffs' expert Steve J. Martin, who has over twenty-five years' experience in correctional\nadministration, and has conducted more than 300 site visits to confinement facilities in over 23\nstates, reported in this case:\nThe pattern of multiple head injuries in a routine application of force in the CPSU exceeds that observed\nin any other confinement setting with which I am familiar. This pattern includes serious injuries such as\nperforated eardrums; fractured noses, teeth and jaws; skull and eye injuries; and rib and back injuries.\nThe sheer number of serious incidents (multiple and serious injuries to inmates) that are disproportionate\nto the threat of harm to staff (because the inmates are either unarmed, restrained or locked securely in a\ncell) is unprecedented in my experience...Multiple head injuries sustained by inmates in routine\napplications of force in the CPSU is so commonplace as to constitute a clear pattern and practice of\nemploying techniques intended to harm rather than restrain and control inmates...The evidence of a\npattern and practice of excessive and unnecessary force in the CPSU from 1988 to 1996 represents the\nmost uniform and prodigious body of evidence, from the highest levels of the Department to line level\nstaff in the CPSU, I've encountered in my career.\nReport of Plaintiffs' Expert, Steve J. Martin, December 1, 1996 at 11, 16, 81.\n1. Scores of inmates in the CPSU suffered significant pain and injury when struck by members of the\nuniformed force. Fifty three inmates suffered fractured bones (not including fractured teeth) in use\nof force incidents between 1989 and 1995; 35 inmates suffered confirmed or suspected perforated\neardrums between 1989 and 1997. Many others suffered lacerations, major contusions and internal\ninjuries. In many, if not most, of the use of force incidents, there was little or no need for the use\nof force at all, or the amount of force was far out of proportion to its need. The Department made\nlittle or no effort to temper the severity of staff s infliction of force. CPSU staff routinely used\nforce as a means of punishing inmates, enforcing obedience, maintaining order, and as a first\nresort in reaction to any inmate behavior that might possibly be interpreted as insubordinate or\naggressive.\n2.  From 1988 through 1997, high-ranking supervisory officials in the Department, including\nCommissioners, Chiefs, CPSU Unit Managers and the Wardens and Deputy Wardens for Security\nof the jails in which the CPSU was located, knew—or deliberately ignored the overwhelming\nevidence available to them— that unnecessary and excessive force was being employed against\nCPSU inmates on a consistent and frequent basis, that large numbers of inmates were being\nseriously injured, and that staff conduct in the Unit presented a substantial risk of serious harm to\nCPSU inmates. These supervisors by their actions, misfeasance and nonfeasance, evidenced a\nconscious disregard of the continuing risk of harm to inmates in the Unit. They permitted the\npattern of unlawful force and its cover-up to develop and persist, and by doing so condoned and\nimplicitly authorized it. These supervisors' actions created an atmosphere in which routine staff\nbrutality in the CPSU was tolerated and encouraged, and thereby enhanced the risk that brutality\nwould continue, which it did. In doing so, these defendants acted with deliberate indifference.\n3.  Despite their knowledge of the continuing pattern of misuse of force and cover-up in the CPSU,\nthe supervisory defendants' response has been either to take no action, or to make ineffective\ngestures towards addressing the systemic deficiencies that allowed the culture of brutality in the\nCPSU to develop and persist. Defendants failed to establish adequate systems for controlling the\n9 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nuse of force by CPSU staff. They knew that as a result of these inadequacies, many inmates in the\nUnit were suffering serious injuries. The culture of violence in the CPSU created a de facto policy\nof corporal punishment in the Unit.\n4.  Specifically, defendants failed to: (1) formulate effective policies for when and how physical force\nshould be used by members of the uniformed staff; (2) ensure that staff in the Unit were properly\nscreened before being placed in the CPSU, were properly supervised once assigned there, and that\ntheir use of force was monitored and reviewed; (3) ensure that adequate, competent, unbiased and\neffective investigations of use of force incidents were conducted; (4) ensure that staff who used\nunnecessary and excessive force, and/or who falsely reported its use, were appropriately\ndisciplined; (5) enforce written policies and procedures requiring the use of video cameras when\nforce was anticipated; and (6) provide effective training to staff in when and how to apply\nnon-injurious force when some force is needed.\n5.  The Department of Correction's failure to guide and train CPSU staff in the appropriate use of\nforce, and its failure to supervise, monitor, investigate and discipline misuse of force, allowed and\nmade inevitable the pattern of misuse of force and infliction of serious injuries on inmates in the\nCPSU.\nThe CPSU at JATC: 1988-1996\nThe Pattern of Correction Officer Brutality and Cover Up\n1. Between March 1, 1988, when the CPSU was officially established, through March 9, 1996, when\nthe Unit was relocated to OBCC, there existed in the unit—by defendants' admissions— a pattern of\nmisconduct by members of the uniformed staff involving not only staff brutality, but \"planned\nbrutality\" and cover up. (Deposition of Commissioner Michael Jacobson, October 23, 29, 1997\n(\"Jacobson deposition\") 36.) The Unit was relocated to OBCC in March, 1996 \"because of the\n[Sheppard] litigation and the problem of misuse [of force] and cover up,\" (Jacobson deposition\n97), a pattern of excessive force and falsification of documents. (Jacobson deposition 39-40.)\n2.  Members of the uniformed staff engaged in a calculated effort to terrorize inmates in the CPSU.\nStaff beat inmates, often in isolated areas of the unit, including cells, dayrooms, search areas and\nstairwells, where no other inmates or civilian staff could witness the assault. (Deposition of CO.\nTurham Gumusdere, January 26, 1995 (\"Gumusdere deposition\") 166; Deposition of A.D.W. and\nUnit Manager of the CPSU in 1995 Robert Dash, February 11, March 3, 1996 (\"Dash deposition\")\n212.) Inmates targeted for assaults by staff were often the last in their housing area to be locked\nout of their cells to attend a service, such as recreation, so that they could be isolated with a group\nof officers and beaten. (Gumusdere deposition 311-12.) Many inmates were beaten while naked.\nBeatings were inflicted to punish inmates for minor misconduct, for verbal complaints, for\nengaging in behavior which staff perceived as disrespectful (Gumusdere deposition 311-2; trial\ntestimony of former CPSU officer Alex Padilla, People vs. Batista, et al. (Bronx County Supreme\nCourt, 7223/96 (hereinafter \"Batista trial testimony,\" 626-654)); Dash deposition 238) or for no\nreason other than to maintain a high level of fear in the unit. \"If an inmate was a problem, they\nwould take care of business...They would beat his ass.\" (Dash deposition 212.) Former CPSU\nofficer Alex Padilla described an August, 1994 use of force incident in which Captain Bianchi\ninstructed the officers, \"if he [an inmate named Lynch] doesn't want to move, let's do it the Merrill\nLynch way, the old fashioned way. Let's beat his ass.\" (Notes of August 17, 1994 interview with\nAlex Padilla by FBI and Department of Investigation staff.) CPSU staff were given \"the green\nlight\" to beat inmates to \"to teach them a lesson.\" (FBI summary of interview with CPSU officer\nHenry Neil, September 18, 1995). Emotionally disturbed and mentally ill inmates were beaten to\npunish them for \"acting out,\" exhibiting behavior associated with their psychiatric conditions.\n(Deposition of Captain David Fullard, July 13, 20 (\"Fullard deposition,\" 422-430.) Commissioner\nof Investigation Howard Wilson stated at a press conference with Mayor Giuiliani that during at\nleast the two year period 1992-1994, there was a \"pattern of deliberate beatings\" of inmates by\nmembers of the uniformed staff in the CPSU. (Transcript, Press Conference, January 23, 1996.)\nAccording to Commissioner Jacobson, \"the CPSU and JATC has [sic] been the subject of several\ncriminal trials, a variety of departmental charges and a number of allegations, a lot of which are\nobviously true....It doesn't surprise me that there was brutality against inmates in JATC because\nthat is sort of a matter of reckoning.\" (Jacobson deposition 94-5.)\n10 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23¯ (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n3.  Inmates were beaten during their admission processing to the CPSU, or threatened with a beating,\nin order to terrify and intimidate them. These admission beatings were known as \"greeting\nbeatings\" and were \"part of the routine\" in the unit. (Letter, Office of Compliance Consultants to\nHon. Morris E. Lasker, June 28,1992; Gumusdere deposition 161, 163; Dash deposition 192-3.)\nThe practice was common knowledge in the unit. (Gumusdere deposition 164.) Officers talked\nabout \"greeting beatings\" in front of supervisors. (Dash deposition 192-3.) One such beating was\ndescribed by a former CPSU officer, as follows: \"As inmates were brought up to the 1A dayroom\nfor new admission process...Officer Beckford and Officers Casciano and Devito [sic] would read\ntheir infraction, and if it was an assault on staff, they would beat up the inmate...[Also present\nwere] Captain Deravin, Captain Bailey and Captain Bianchi...sometimes they would just go in\nthere and add a shot.\" (Transcript of May 17, 1994 interview with Officer Alex Padilla by FBI and\nNew York City Department of Investigation.)\n4.  CPSU staff engaged in other sadistic and humiliating conduct. Officers forced some inmates who\nentered the unit with tobacco, which was prohibited in the segregation areas, to eat their cigarettes.\n(Gumusdere deposition 158-9.) Officers in the unit held some inmates' heads in toilet bowls and\nflushed the toilets. (Letter, Mary Jo Mullan, Office of Compliance Consultants, to Judge Lasker,\nJune 28, 1992; Trial Testimony, United States v. Roger Johnson. 96 Cr. 18 (SHS) (hereinafter\n\"Johnson Trial Testimony\") 286.)\n5.  Members of the uniformed staff assigned to the CPSU used force against inmates far in excess of\nany need to restrain an inmate. (Deposition of JATC Warden Andrew Phoenix, March 25, 26, 27,\n1997 (\"Phoenix deposition\") 645; Gumusdere deposition 341; Dash deposition 189-1.) Force was\nused for the purpose of inflicting pain (Dash deposition 241-2), ` and not in any good faith effort\nto restore order. (Gumusdere deposition 341.) Supervisors in the jail knew that many inmates\nbeaten in the CPSU suffered serious injuries, including perforated eardrums, fractured noses, jaws\nand other bones, and multiple traumatic injuries on a regular basis. (Dash deposition 58; Phoenix\ndeposition 122.) Many inmates required hospitalization for treatment of their injuries. Some\ninmates suffered permanent injuries from the beatings, including visual impairment and hearing\nloss. A number of inmates beaten in the CPSU suffered severe internal injuries, such as contused\nlivers and kidneys. Visible abrasions, contusions, and lacerations associated with punches to the\nface and body were common after a use of force incident. One inmate beaten by CPSU officers\ndied from his injuries. (See, Jacobson deposition 187 (Q: \"...[Y]ou know that somebody was\n[killed in the CPSU] don't you? A: Bryant.\")) JATC was known among officers and supervisory\nuniformed staff in the Department of Correction as \"the house of pain\" (Fullard deposition, 376,\n421; Deposition of CO. Calixto Herrera, March 23, 1995 (\"Herrera deposition\") 297; Dash\ndeposition 83-4), and the CPSU staff was known in the Department of Correction as \"a bunch of\nass kickers.\" (Fullard deposition 421.)\n6.  Staff assaults on inmates in the CPSU were routinely documented falsely in the records prepared\nat the jail as assaults on staff. The officers' use of force was justified as \"defensive\" no matter how\nextensive the inmate's injuries, and how minimal the officers' injuries. Alex Padilla, a correction\nofficer who worked in the CPSU from 1990 to 1994, cooperated with the United States\nDepartment of Justice and the New York City Department of Investigation (\"DOI\") investigation\ninto allegations of correction officer brutality and cover-up in the CPSU. Padilla stated to the FBI\nand DOI investigators under oath on May 17, 1994: \"I know that ninety-five percent of the uses of\nforce in HDM are covered up or lied. Everybody lied in their reports, so that it could coincide with\nthe injuries, it could coincide with the guidelines or the directives of the use of force policy,\nbecause if they all say what really happened, they would all be arrested.... And it's common\nknowledge, that's common knowledge.\" (Transcript of May 17, 1994 interview with Alex Padilla\nby FBI and DOI.)\n7.  Injuries to inmates inflicted by staff were routinely reported to Department supervisors, including\nthe Commissioner and her senior staff, in daily \"24 hour reports,\" which purported to justify as\n\"self defense\" uniformed staffs striking inmates in the face numerous times. (Letter, Assistant\nCommissioner Toni V. Bair to Commissioner Catherine Abate, April 11,1992.) The level of force\nused in the CPSU almost always involved multiple punches to the inmate's face or head, usually\nadministered by more than one officer. Warden Phoenix observed that there was a \"common\"\nscenario in which officers reported that they responded to a blow or threat of a blow from an\ninmate by applying multiple punches to the face and head and then wrestled the inmate to the\nfloor. (Phoenix deposition 419.) If an inmate suffered severe injuries to his face and head, these\n11 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nwounds were in many cases attributed to his having fallen to the floor face first when restrained\nwith a wrestling hold after one or more officers punched him in the face or head. (Deposition of\nA.D.W. and former CPSU Unit Manager Jose Viera, January 30-31, February 3, 1997 (\"Viera\ndeposition\") 200.) Former JATC Deputy Warden for Security Bird testified to another variation of\nthe scenario: a spontaneous, unprovoked attack by a prisoner against an officer. (Deposition of\nJames Bird, April 3-5, 1997 (\"Bird deposition\") 164, 166.)\n8. Uniformed staff assigned to the CPSU routinely falsified official Department documents to mask\ntheir involvement in incidents in which inmates were beaten and injured. (Dash deposition 217.)\nThe cover-ups of brutality were \"organized\" and \"patterned.\" (Jacobson deposition 95.) Some staff\nmembers reported their participation in an incident at which they were not present in order to\nconceal the involvement of a fellow officer whose presence was not reported. Other staff,\nincluding supervisors, failed to report their presence and participation in use of force incidents.\n(Gumusdere deposition 335-6; Johnson Trial Testimony 274-276.) Staff members wrote reports\nfor other officers to sign, or wrote their reports together, to ensure that the reports were consistent.\n(Deposition of CO. Efrain Mojica, September 22, 1994, (\"Mojica deposition\") 184, 139;\nDeposition of ADW and former CPSU Unit Manager Jose Viera, January 301, February 3, 1997\n(Viera deposition) 272, 600, 273, 361; Deposition of JATC Deputy Warden for Security Terrence\nSkinner, January 10, 16, 17, 1997 (\"Skinner deposition\") 155-6; Jacobson deposition 411.) Former\nCPSU Officer Alex Padilla described several beatings that occurred in 1992 after which different\ncaptains either gave him a use of force report which had already been prepared and instructed him\nto copy it in his own handwriting, or instructed him how to prepare a false report. (Transcript of\nMay 17,1994 interview with Officer Alex Padilla by FBI and DOI11-14,15-16.)\n9.  Officers and captains carried razor blades and other contraband weapons to \"throw down\" after an\ninmate was beaten so that staff could falsely claim the inmate assaulted them with a weapon.\n(Gumusdere deposition 331-4; Fullard deposition 181-2; Phoenix deposition 648.) Officer Roger\nJohnson told Inspector General Michael Caruso and other law enforcement personnel on May 3,\n1995, that when he worked in the CPSU between September, 1991 and October, 1994 he carried\nrazor blades with him on duty like other correction officers. (Johnson Trial Testimony 286-7.)\nOfficer William Spissinger, who was assigned to the CPSU from 1988—1993, testified that he\ncarried razor blades in his memo book, as did other officers in the jail, and that some officers told\nhim they had dropped razor blades at the scene of a use of force incident. (Deposition of Officer\nWilliam Spissinger, April 27, May 4, 1995 (\"Spissinger deposition\") 298.)\n10.  Some officers, after gratuitously beating an inmate, falsely claimed that the inmate struck and\ninjured them so that they could report that they struck the inmate in \"self-defense.\"  (Gumusdere\ndeposition 341.) To support these fabrications, officers solicited other officers to punch them in\nthe face to leave an injury that could be documented by medical staff. (Fullard deposition 190-2,\n315, 361-3; Gumusdere deposition 353; Johnson Trial Testimony 262-266, 277-9, 160-165;\nTestimony of Alex Padilla, Batista trial transcript 644-651; Phoenix deposition 433-4, 832\n(\"recognizes\" injuries to officer cheekbones in CPSU use of force packages); Phoenix deposition\n610-12 (staff facial bruises an element of use of force \"scenario\" in CPSU); Bird deposition 560-1\n(\"substantial number\" of conspicuous injuries to officers' cheeks reported in a number of CPSU\nuse of force incidents).)\n11.  Former CPSU Officers Henry Neil and Roger Johnson provided detailed information to the FBI\nand the New York City Department of Investigation (DOI) in 1995 concerning the planned\nbeating of a number of CPSU inmates on December 11, 1992, and the elaborate\ncover-up—involving the infliction of injuries by officers on other officers and the preparation of\nfalse reports—which was subsequently orchestrated by CPSU supervisors. Seven inmates were\nseverely beaten by CPSU staff and treated at hospitals for their injuries in this incident.\n12. Johnson informed the FBI and DOI that the officers who participated in the beatings were\ninstructed at roll call that day to \"beat down\" the inmates in Block 1A during a block search.\nCaptain Martinez approached Johnson and Officer Charles Sanacore and instructed them to beat\nHector Batista, who was being held in the CPSU after a notorious hostage-taking incident at\nanother jail.\n13.  Johnson stated that after roll call he and Sanacore proceeded to Block 1 A. When they went to\nBatista's cell, they instructed him to strip. When he was slow in cooperating Sanacore struck him,\nand Batista tried to hide under his bed. Johnson dragged Batista out from under the bed and held\nhim while Officers Day, Sanacore, and another officer, probably Rodriguez, beat him. Rodriguez\n12 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nused a baton.\n14. After the incident, Johnson went to the jail clinic, where he saw Batista bleeding from the face,\nhandcuffed. Johnson walked over to Batista and punched him twice in the ribs.\n15.  Officer Johnson stated that he submitted a false report about the incident. After the incident, he\nasked Captain Martinez how he should write it up. Captain Martinez told him to report that staff\nhad been assaulted with a weapon. A short while later, Captain Martinez showed him a shank\nwhich they would say had been used by Batista in the incident. Martinez then wrote out a report,\nwhich Johnson copied in his own handwriting, and signed. The report stated that Batista had\nproduced a shank, which was not true. Either Captain Sanchez or Captain Olivari gave Johnson\nthe report Martinez had written. Johnson also reported that Batista had struck him in the face,\nwhich also was not true. Johnson asked Officer Moore to strike him in the face with his fist to\nleave an injury and thereby justify the use of force. Johnson also struck himself in the face.\nJohnson said that on a prior occasion he had struck Officer Lampe to leave a bruise which could\nbe attributed to an inmate assault. He also said that some officers had rubbed carbon paper on their\nfaces to fabricate evidence of an injury and thereby justify a use of force, and the officer could\nthen go out on compensation leave.\nUnited States v. Roger Johnson. 96 Cr. 18 (SHS), Transcript 262-266, 277-9, 160-165, 652-3.\n•  Prior to this meeting with prosecutors, Johnson had been recorded by Officer Padilla, who was\nalready cooperating with the FBI and the Department of Investigation, in a conversation in the\nCPSU about the December 11, 1992 incident. Among other things, Johnson told Padilla: that he\nand the other officers with him \"were still kicking and stomping and hitting [Batista]....He\n[Batista] didn't know what was hitting him. He was screaming like a bitch\"; that Captain Martinez\nhad told Johnson at roll call to \"demolish\" Batista during the search; that Captain Olivari had\nasked him if he wanted to participate in the operation before they went into the block; and that\n\"the whole thing was planned for weeks, man. They wanted to do it a week earlier. [It] came from\ndowntown.\" \"That's why we rumbled. They had to make it look good. Made the whole thing up.\"\n\"Captain Sanchez, Captain Olivari they looked on, that's all they were supposed to do for the\nreport....It was funny, Dep. Bird knew the deaL.Sanacore didn't get knifed. He cut his hand. He\nput it down on the report that he got punctured.\"\nUnited States v. Roger Johnson. 96 Cr. 18 ÍSHS`) Exhibit ID 77T (Transcript of August 27, 1994 tape\nrecorded conversation between Johnson and Padilla).\n•  Neil told the FBI that, after the inmates were beaten in the housing area, and while he and other\nofficers were in the CPSU captains' office, \"Neil was struck by CO. Figueroa on his leg, incurring\na bruise. Neil inflicted an injury to himself by making a mark on his face...to substantiate the fact\nthat the correction officers were attacked by the inmates. CO. Santana showed Neil how to\nproperly give himself a mark on his face... [and then] inflicted an injury on himself, and Neil\nstruck Figueroa on the shoulder. Figueroa kicked Neil in Neil's upper left leg....All this was done\nto legitimize the correction officers' need to exert physical force to subdue alleged hostile inmates.\n...Neil rode in an ambulance [from the jail to a hospital] with COs Brophy, Peele, Sanacore, Santana and\nFigueroa. Neil recalled that they were all laughing and even stopped and got a six pack of beer for the\nride to the hospital. The correction officers were all laughing and talking about how much compensatory\ntime they were going to take off...\n...Upon returning to Rikers Island [Neil saw] Captain Oliveri in a conference room orchestrating the\nsubmission of the use of force and compensation forms required of the correction officers. Neil advised\nthat he totally fabricated CO. Figueroa's use of force report and that Captain Oliveri approved of Neil's\n'report writing.'...Oliveri supervised the bogus report writing to ensure conformity in the COs written\nversion of what transpired.\"\nMemorandum, Special Agent James B. Hughes, September 18, 1995, at 2-3..\n13 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n1. Members of the uniformed staff often solicited CPSU inmates who were beaten or who witnessed\nbeatings to make or write false statements about the incidents. (Fullard deposition 510-11.) Staff\nmembers directed inmates to say they didn't see or hear anything, or told them not to report the\nincident at all. Inmates were instructed to sign false statements about the source of their injuries as\na condition of receiving medical treatment. Some inmates were offered early discharge from the\nCPSU if they cooperated in covering up a beating (Dash deposition 225); others were threatened\nwith additional beatings or disciplinary charges if they reported the incidents.\n2.  At least one Department supervisor suspected that CPSU officers used and directed inmates to\ncommit assaults on other inmates. (Memorandum, April 8, 1993, Integrity Control Officer Velez\nto Deputy Director of Investigations Pagan.) CPSU officers would release an inmate from his cell\nso that he could fight another inmate. In the CPSU, providing an inmate with an opportunity and\nlocation to fight another inmate was known as \"giving five minutes\" or allowing a \"one-on-one.\"\n(Phoenix deposition 490.) These incidents were also known as cockfights (Fullard deposition\n168-9) because CPSU staff considered them sporting events. \"Everybody in Correction heard\nabout it...it's very out in the open.\" (Gumusdere deposition 71.)\n3.  Members of the uniformed staff assigned to the CPSU punished inmates by withholding rights and\nprivileges guaranteed by the Minimum Standards of the Board of Correction and by prior orders\nof the court. (Benjamin v. Malcolm. 75 Civ. 3073.) This punishment took the form of housing\ninmates in cells without mattresses, operative toilets or light bulbs; denying them telephone calls\nor access to recreation, law library or medical attention. (Dash deposition 189-91, 100-1, 238.)\nDenying an inmate a service or entitlement was referred to as \"burning him\" or \"putting him on\nthe burn.\" JATC Warden Phoenix testified that denying inmates access to mandated services was\n\"part of the operation of the [New York City] jails,\" including the CPSU, and it was a practice he\ncould not stop. (Phoenix deposition 500-1.) Officer Melvin Ancrum testified that he and other\nofficers had peremptorily denied CPSU inmates access to recreation (\"burning an inmate for\nyard\") and phone calls as a means of punishing inmates and exerting informal control. (Deposition\nof Officer Melvin Ancrum, October 25, December 19, 1994 (\"Ancrum deposition\") 113-119.)\nMost CPSU captains were aware of these practices. (Ancrum deposition 120.)\nKnowledge of the JATC and CPSU Command\n1. The use of force reports generated by CPSU staff—which were reviewed and signed by Unit and\njail supervisors—document hundreds of incidents in which inmates suffered severe injuries in\nincidents in which they were struck in the presence of more than one correction officer, often in\nisolated areas of the jail. Exhibit 1 to this Declaration is a chart which summarizes 1062 use of\nforce incidents in the CPSU between 1988 and 1995, listing for each month the number of\nincidents occurring in isolated areas of the jail, and the number in which a CPSU inmate was\ninvolved with more than one officer. Exhibit 2 to this Declaration lists injuries to some of the\nCPSU inmates who were injured by Department of Correction staff members in use of force\nincidents between 1990 and 1995.\n2.  The supervisory staff at JATC—the CPSU unit manager, the Deputy Warden for Security and the\nWarden—had personal knowledge of the pattern of misconduct described in the preceding\nparagraphs within weeks of the opening of the unit in March, 1988, and continuing thereafter\nthrough March, 1996. Over this eight year period, these supervisors turned a blind eye-and a deaf\near—to the evidence of staff brutality. These jail supervisors reviewed the written use of force\nreports, injury to inmate reports and supervisor's investigative reports concerning virtually every\nuse of force incident that occurred in the CPSU. These supervisors also reviewed the reports\nwhich were prepared after an inmate alleged that he was beaten in an unreported incident. Andrew\nPhoenix, who was the Warden at JATC from 1989 through 1993, testified that: \"I just probably\nknew what was going on... it was obvious things were going on...At least I tried to do\nsomething...[The prior Warden, from 1988-89] \"ran like a thief  [from the jail] because he didn't\nhave \"the nerves\" to stay there.\" (Phoenix deposition 168, 257, 802.)\n3.  Indeed, Andrew Phoenix stated repeatedly at his deposition that he was aware, through a variety of\nsources, of the existence or probable existence of a pattern of staff abuse of inmates in the CPSU;\nthat he believed these allegations to be true; that he communicated his belief to other high-ranking\nDepartment of Correction officials; and that he failed to address the abuse at the jail:\n14 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n1. When he was at HDM/JATC from 1989 through 1993, Phoenix couldn't stop the brutality; nor had\nany other Warden before him. (Phoenix deposition 561.) He believed that JATC had the highest\nrates of staff-inmate violence during his tenure, and before it. Phoenix testified that \"nothing\nchanged much\" during his tenure. (Phoenix deposition 201.)\n1. He knew, independent of the use of force packages he read, that inmates in the CPSU were being\ninjured seriously and frequently by officers. (Phoenix deposition 122.)\n2.  From when he took over as Warden (in 1989), to when the complaint in this case was filed\n(February, 1993), Phoenix heard allegations of staff brutality. (Phoenix deposition 172.) He\nsuspected staff was beating up inmates and getting away with it. (Phoenix deposition 174.)\n3.  By December, 1989, he had suspicions that there were things going on in the unit he did not know\nabout, and that use of force incidents were not being reported accurately. (Phoenix deposition\n194-5.) What he suspected was being covered up was unnecessary and excessive use of force by\nstaff. (Phoenix deposition 195.) Phoenix suspected that there were incidents in the CPSU in which\ninmates were the victim of excessive or unnecessary force. (Phoenix deposition 655.) Physical\nabuse of inmates occurred from time to time, \"over again.\" (Phoenix deposition 654.) He\nsuspected the inmate allegations were true because the allegations were consistent over a period of\ntime. (Phoenix deposition 215-6.) Based on the consistency of allegations of which he was aware\nover a period time, he had suspicions that CPSU bing staff was engaging in unnecessary and\nexcessive force on inmates in the CPSU. (Phoenix deposition 252.)\n4.  Phoenix suspected that the inmate allegations about beatings, and about denial for services, were\ntrue. (Phoenix deposition 502.)\n5. Phoenix suspected that inmates were being assaulted by staff and beaten up. (Phoenix deposition\n427.) He testified that he did not know if there is a \"blue wall of silence\" in the Department of\nCorrection. He does know that officers \"cooperate with each other very often.\" (Phoenix\ndeposition 506.) But some \"snitch\" on other officers to the FBI. (Phoenix deposition 505.)\n1. Phoenix suspected that some force was unreported, and that staff \"overreacted\" in some instances.\n(Phoenix deposition 643.) He suspected officers used excessive force out of \"frustration, and they\ngot out their frustration because inmates \"caused them grief.\" ( Phoenix deposition 644.) If an\ninmate threatens an officer, the officer is supposed to \"restrain\" the inmate first, \"get order, then\nwrite an infraction.\" (Phoenix deposition 644-5.)\n2.  But Phoenix believed \"of course\" that some members of the uniformed force used force without\njustification against inmates in response to inmate misconduct. (Phoenix deposition 645.)\n3.  He agreed that he heard from some inmates that some officers were engaged in malicious and\nsadistic beatings of inmates. He heard the same names over and over again. He did not move the\nofficers because, as he testified at his deposition, \"I can't just move them because they were\nbeating them up and I can't prove it.\" (Phoenix deposition 393.)\n4.  He suspected but could not prove that there were deliberate beatings of inmates in the CPSU.\n(Phoenix deposition 390.)\n5.  He was \"concerned\" about the numbers of inmates being injured in use of force incidents.\n(Phoenix deposition 117.)\n6.  He was \"constantly conscious\" of the issue of brutality and cover-up when he was the Warden.\n(Phoenix deposition 769.) The issue was raised at federal court conferences, and was in the press.\nIt was \"definitely\" the subject of frequent complaints from the Legal Aid Society. (Phoenix\n15 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\ndeposition 768.)\n1. He could not get a grip on the brutality, but he thought he \"did some pretty great things there.\"\n(Phoenix deposition 410.)\n1. He was aware that in 1990 and 1991 there were a number of allegations made to the Investigation\nDivision that inmates had been struck by staff in incidents that went unreported. \"I just probably\nknew what was going on.\" (Phoenix deposition 168.)\n2.  At one time he was \"desperate\" to find out what was going on. \"I wanted to find out what was\ngoing on.\" (Phoenix deposition 234-5.)\n3.  Phoenix testified at his deposition that \"a lot of use of force happened the same way\" (Phoenix\ndeposition 624.): incidents occurred in search rooms (Phoenix deposition 617.) One \"scenario\"\ninvolved the last inmate to be locked out to go to the yard being alone with staff in a dayroom.\nAfter the \"use of force incident,\" staff reported that they sustained facial bruises. The inmate\nwould go to the hospital for treatment of his injuries. There were no inmate witnesses. The\nincident involving plaintiff Barron Cunningham on October 12, 1990, was an example of that\n\"scenario, \" with which Phoenix was already familiar by that date. (Phoenix deposition 619-21.)\n4.  Even though Phoenix recognized the reports of incidents such as Cunningham's as a \"scenario\"\nwhich he had read in use of force packages a number of times, he continued to rely on the Deputy\nWarden for Security to investigate these incidents. (Phoenix deposition 625.)\n5.  Phoenix was aware of a number of incidents in cross over areas, search rooms, bridge areas, and\nclinic corridors. Phoenix \"is sure\" that \"from time to time\" there were incidents in which inmates\nwere victims of excessive force or unreported incidents in areas of the Bing where no other\ninmates could see, such as search rooms, cross overs, bridge areas. (Phoenix deposition 647.) He\nsuspected that reports of some of these incidents were not truthful, and some incidents were not\nreported at all. (Phoenix deposition 646-7.) From reading the reports, he could see that \"many\"\nincidents took place in areas with no inmate witnesses. (Phoenix deposition 226-7', 413-4.) This\ncreated a suspicion that inmates were being targeted for beatings in areas with no inmate\nwitnesses. As a result, he ordered that captains be present in the crossovers when inmates were\nbeing searched. \"It should be a rare case where the officer sees the inmate in the crossover.\"\n(Phoenix deposition 227-8.) In most of the use of force incidents which took place in the crossover\nareas, however, no supervisor was present.\n6.  Phoenix testified that there were some incidents that occurred where the inmate involved in the\nuse of force was naked. (Phoenix deposition 415.)\n7. There was a \"common\" scenario in which the officers reported that they responded to a blow or\nthreat of a blow from an inmate by applying multiple punches to the face and head and then\nwrestled the inmate to the floor. (Phoenix deposition 419.)\n8. He thought that if the Investigations Division could not find out what was going on, he could not.\n(Phoenix deposition 168-9, 214.)\n9. Even after he left HDM/JATC in 1993, and after public disclosure of the federal and state criminal\ninvestigations into inmate beatings which occurred while he was the Warden, Phoenix was afraid\nto talk to anybody about the federal investigation of HDM because he thought people were\nwearing recording devices. (Phoenix deposition 435.)\n10.  Warden Phoenix testified that correction officer brutality is \"ingrained in the culture\" of the New\nYork City Department of Correction, and was \"part of the overall operations of the jail.\" (Phoenix\ndeposition 561, 410.) He and other JATC supervisors knew that large numbers of inmates were\nbeing severely injured by correction officers in incidents which were falsely reported by the\nofficers and their direct supervisors, the CPSU captains, as self-defense. These jail supervisors\n16 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nknew that correction officers resented the Department of Correction use of force policy because\nthey perceived it as \"tying their hands\" and preventing them from punishing difficult inmates by\nbeating them. These supervisors tolerated the practice of CPSU officers beating inmates, and\nthereby encouraged the practice to develop into a de facto policy of using deliberate beatings as a\nmanagement tool.\n11.  Robert Dash, who was a tour commander in the CPSU and was Unit Manager in 1995 \"saw\" a\npattern of inmates being beaten in isolated locations of the jail (Dash deposition 106), and \"knew\"\nthat inmates were sustaining broken bones, perforated eardrums, and multiple trauma to their faces\nand heads on a monthly basis. (Dash deposition 59-60.) He \"believed\" that inmates were singled\nout and beaten, and that these incidents were covered up between 1989 and 1996. (Dash\ndeposition 185.) He \"overheard\" officers talk about \"initiation rites\" and he \"heard\" officers\ntalking about \"taking care of business,\" which he understood to mean, \"they would beat his\n[inmate's] ass.\" (Dash deposition 212.) Although he heard from inmates and staff that inmates \"got\ntheir behinds whipped,\" he did nothing in response: \"These are rumors~I didn't do anything about\nit. They were people talking.\" (Dash deposition at 388-9.)\n12.  Some jail supervisors, including the CPSU unit manager in 1988, the facility Deputy Warden for\nSecurity in 1989, and unit captains, ordered CPSU officers to beat and injure inmates to punish\nthem. (Fullard deposition, 221-228, 229-34, 446-9; Johnson Trial Testimony 262-266 (direction\nfrom captain to \"demolish\" an inmate); see also, Memorandum, Investigator Peter Brookins to\nDeputy Director of Investigations Ralph Mierzejewski, December 9, 1988 (\"Three uses of force\nthat I am investigating or have knowledge of have occurred in an area in the front of the housing\narea out of sight of other inmates with two of these having allegations made to the effect that the\nCaptain signaled the Officers giving them a green light to use force on the inmates.\").\n13.  The City has produced in discovery in this case hundreds of reports prepared by CPSU staff and\napproved by the unit and jail supervisors for the period 1988--1996. Many, if not most, of these\nreports utilized boilerplate language to document and justify \"uses of force\" in which officers\nrepeatedly struck inmates to the face, head and body, inflicting serious injuries. Unit and jail\nsupervisors knew that many of the officers' reports were written collusively by the officers\ninvolved in the incidents. (Phoenix deposition 400-403; Dash deposition 217; Skinner deposition\n155-60, 335-8; Gumusdere deposition 241-2.) Many of these reports included descriptions of\ninmate assaults on officers with weapons, many of which the supervisors knew or suspected were\nintroduced to the scene of the incident by staff. (Dash deposition 215-6, 228.) Other reports\npurported to document injuries to officers which had been inflicted by inmates, but were known\nby the supervisory staff to have been inflicted by the officers themselves. (Dash deposition 213-4.)\n14. Deputy Warden Terrence Skinner was assigned as the Deputy Warden for Security at JATC in\nDecember, 1994, and remained there until October, 1995. At least during the first part of his\ntenure at JATC, Skinner considered the jail, including the CPSU, to be \"out of control.\" (Skinner\ndeposition 648.) Skinner believed that staff needed to be disciplined and re-trained. (Skinner\ndeposition 648.) Staff failed to provide documentation of incidents; there were pervasive security\nbreaches in housing areas, including the storage of broom and mop sticks in officers' stations and\nsome shanks in desk drawers. (Skinner deposition 652.) Skinner believed that officers were\nstealing, or were permitting inmates to steal, inmate property that was supposed to be kept in\nlocked lockers. (Skinner deposition 180, 654-5.) \"At times,\" Skinner knew, there were a number\nof officers off-post in the CPSU. (Skinner deposition 247.) Skinner observed officers wearing\nunauthorized gloves, cut-off gloves. (Skinner deposition 248-9.)\n15.  According to Skinner, one of the reasons why JATC was \"out of control\" when he arrived there\nwas the quality of the facility supervisors— captains and assistant deputy wardens, and when\nSkinner was first assigned there, the Unit Manager of the CPSU. (Skinner deposition 653-4.)\nSkinner had concluded by January, 1995, that the failure to provide CPSU inmates with programs\nand services at that time—failures of which he had learned through personal observation and\ninmate complaints (Skinner deposition 115)—was caused by inadequate supervision of line\nofficers by captains and assistant deputy wardens. (Skinner deposition 117.) Skinner believed the\nCPSU Unit Manager was indifferent to whether CPSU inmates received the services to which they\nwere entitled. (Skinner deposition 122.)\n16.  Other measures of the jail being \"out of control\" were the number of uses of force and inmate\nstabbings and slashings. (Skinner deposition 656.) During his tenure at JATC, Skinner received\ncomplaints from inmates that they had been housed in cells without light bulbs for more than a\n17 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nday. (Skinner deposition 585.)\n17. The use of force reports prepared by the CPSU and JATC staff were reviewed and approved by\nthe unit and jail commanders, and forwarded to the Commissioner and Chief of Department.\nThese reports consistently demonstrated a fundamental bias towards exonerating the staff of any\nmisconduct, and finding that the use of force, no matter how severe the injuries, was an\nappropriate response to assaultive inmate conduct. In fact, these reports were written for the very\npurpose of absolving Department staff of any liability for injuries the inmates sustained when they\nwere struck by correction staff. A few attempts by Department staff to conduct independent\ninvestigations into use of force incidents in the CPSU were met with threats by CPSU and JATC\nsupervisors. (Fullard deposition 306-313.)\n18. The facility reports demonstrated a double standard in evaluating inmate and correction officer\naccounts. (Viera deposition 590-1.) They characterized the officers' reports as credible if they were\nconsistent; but they dismissed as collusive and fabricated inmate statements which were consistent\nwith each other. At the same time, they rejected an inmate's allegation that he was the subject of\nunnecessary or excessive force in the absence of corroborative statements from other inmates. The\nfacility reports minimized the inmate injuries, and credited the officers' accounts because the\ninjury was always consistent with the description of the force used by staff. The reports often\ndescribed the officers' injuries in ways that were not consistent with medical findings, or relied on\nclinical findings of officer injuries made long after the inmate allegedly inflicted the injuries.\n19. From the time the unit was opened until it was moved out of JATC, the supervisory staff of the\nCPSU and JATC~with the exception of the unit manager during the period October, 1988 through\nMay, 1989—took no meaningful steps to curb the abuse of inmates in the unit. These supervisors\nconsistently failed to conduct independent, thorough and unbiased investigations of incidents in\nwhich correction staff struck inmates. Jail and unit supervisors refused to interview staff members\nafter they had used force, and instead relied on their written reports in preparing the facility\ninvestigation. These supervisors failed to review the records of officers' use of force history, even\nthough a Department directive required such review. The supervisors failed to require that CPSU\nstaff video tape incidents in which force was anticipated, such as whenever an inmates' cell was\nopened, even though this was required by an institutional order. The supervisors consistently\nrejected inmate allegations of unreported beatings, even when the inmate had obviously been\ninjured by blunt force trauma and there was no reasonable explanation to account for his injuries\nother than to credit his allegation. The refusal of these supervisors to acknowledge the pattern of\nbrutality which they knew existed, and to take any steps to curb it, were substantial factors in the\ncontinuation of the staff violence and other misconduct.\n20.  Indeed, the pattern of staff misconduct in the CPSU was so blatant, the number of inmates\nseverely injured so great, and the number and frequency of incidents so consistent over the period\n1988—1996 that the failure of supervisors at the jail to acknowledge and address the problem\ndemonstrates that these supervisors deliberately chose to allow officers to brutalize inmates as a\nmeans of exercising management and control.\n21.  This inference is consistent with evidence in the record that some supervisors, including the CPSU\nUnit Manager Danny Trapp, and the Deputy Warden for Security William Kozack, ordered\ncaptains to have inmates beaten by officers to punish them for minor misconduct and to falsify\nDepartment reports concerning the incident. (Fullard deposition 221-4, 446-5.) Other captains\nordered inmates to be beaten, and orchestrated the cover-up of the beating by advising officers\nhow to write their reports, and that they should falsely claim inmates attacked staff with weapons.\n(Johnson Trial Testimony 262-6, 277-9, 160-5.)\nParticipation and Acquiescence of Department Managers\n1. Some Department officials with knowledge of the CPSU knew or believed that a pattern of\nexcessive and unnecessary force by staff existed there. Other Department officials suspected that\nsuch a pattern existed but took no effective action to verify whether it in fact existed.\n2.  Department supervisors tolerated the practice of CPSU officers beating inmates and falsely\nreporting the incidents as the use of force to defend themselves. These supervisors thereby\nencouraged the brutality and cover-up to develop into a de facto policy in the CPSU of using\ndeliberate beatings as a management tool. The reliance on misuse of force and its cover up in the\nCPSU were the direct consequences of decisions made between 1988 and 1990 by Commissioner\n18 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nKoehler, and his successor, Commissioner Sielaff. Koehler assigned Danny Trapp as the first Unit\nManager of the CPSU in 1988. Trapp was known in the Department of Correction as a \"head\nknocker,\" someone who beat inmates or approved of their beating as a management technique.\n(Memorandum, Assistant Commissioner Colon to Chief of Department Mitchell, May 30, 1990.)\nIn July, 1988, Trapp stated publicly that his management philosophy in administering the Unit\nwas: \"We try to control with respect, but there are those you control with fear.\" (New York\nNewsday, July 31, 1988.) Trapp generated fear by directing officers and captains to \"take care of\ninmates\" who acted disrespectfully to Department employees, by which he meant, \"if [an inmate]\ngets out of line, fuck him up.\" (Fullard deposition 222, 225.)\n3.  Howard Robertson was assigned as the Unit Manager of the CPSU in October, 1988. With the\nknowledge of the Commissioner, he took successful steps to reduce unnecessary and excessive\nforce in the Unit. (See, Memorandum, \"New York City House of Detention for Men/Central\nPunitive Segregation Unit,\" Ralph Mierzejewski to Bonnie Nathan, November 29, 1988;\nMemorandum, Bonnie Nathan to Richard Koehler, December 12, 1988.) CPSU staff became\nresistant to Robertson's initiatives, and in May, 1989 demanded—and were afforded—a meeting\nwith the Commissioner and the Chief of Department. At the meeting, these officers demanded that\nRobertson be removed because he would not \"back\" his officers and allow them to use force as a\n\"legitimate reprisal\" to punish inmates who violated facility rules. (Deposition of Prof. Robert J.\nKelly (Commissioner Koehler's consultant on the CPSU), September 30, 1994 (\"Kelly\ndeposition\") 99; Kelly Memorandum, Impressions of the Commissioner's Meeting With the\nCorrection Officers of the CPSU, May 12, 1989 (\"Problems start and end with the Unit\nCommander, the ADW who has failed to support his COs.\").) Immediately after the meeting,\nRobertson was removed from his position as CPSU Unit Manager.\n4.  Following Robertson's removal, inmate injuries in use of force incidents in the Unit were more\nfrequent and more severe. According to Department records, there were 13 reported use of force\nincidents in the CPSU in the 19 days following the Commissioner's meeting with CPSU officers,\nwhich was more than there had been in the previous three months.\n5.  When Allyn Sielaff became Commissioner he instituted a number of measures that signaled a\nrelaxation, if not a repudiation, of the Department's formal use of force policy. These steps\nincluded: (1) issuing a public statement to a newspaper that he was terminating the Assistant\nCommissioner for Investigation and Discipline, Bonnie Nathan, because she had been \"unduly\nharsh\" in her approach to disciplining officers who violated Department policies, The\nChief-Leader, July 27, 1990, pp. 1,8; (2) withdrawing authority from the Investigation Division to\ncharge officers with violating the use of force policy, and assigning that responsibility to the\nwardens of the jails; (3) re-assigning half of the Investigation Division's use of force unit to other\nduties and removing resources from ID, including cars, which impaired the ability of ID staff to\nrespond to incidents, and to conduct interviews of inmates injured by uniformed staff and of\nwitnesses to these incidents; and (4) declaring that the Department would significantly expand the\nCPSU from 300 beds to over one thousand, converting the entire James A. Thomas Center to the\nCPSU.\n6.  During Commissioner Sielaff s administration, the Department reduced the number of excessive\nforce cases it prosecuted at OATH from 79 cases brought between January and July, 1990, to 28\nbrought from July through December, 1990, and to 2 cases brought between December, 1990 and\nJuly, 1991.\n7. These decisions were made in response to the perception that officers throughout the Department,\nincluding the CPSU, were suffering from low morale because, inter alia, they believed the\nDepartment's use of force policy was too restrictive.\n8. During the eight years the CPSU operated at JATC, supervisors in the Department's central office\nknew of the number, frequency and severity of staff use of force in the CPSU, and that these\nincidents, over time, clearly constituted a pattern of brutality and other misconduct that was\non-going and widespread in the unit. CPSU personnel submitted written reports of every use of\nforce incident and allegation of unreported force which occurred in the CPSU between March 1,\n1988 and March 9, 1996 for review by supervisors at the highest level of the Department of\nCorrection, including the Commissioner, Chief of Department, Chief of Security, Investigation\nDivision and Division Chief (later \"Assistant Chief). These reports included both \"use of force\nreports,\" detailed reports submitted pursuant to Department policy after every use of force, and\ndaily summaries of use of force activity (\"24-hour\" or \"CCC\" [Communications Control Center]\n19 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nreports). From these written reports, as well as from other sources, senior Department officials in\nthe Commissioner's office knew as early as December, 1988 that CPSU inmates were being\nsubjected to physical force in exceptionally high numbers, that there were repeated, consistent\nallegations of brutality and cover-up by uniformed staff in the jail, and that the brutality appeared\nto represent a calculated decision by facility personnel to manage the unit through fear,\nintimidation and the infliction of serious injury. (See, Memorandum, Ralph Mierzejewski to\nAssistant Commissioner Bonnie Nathan, December 12, 1988 (\"[T]aking into consideration that\nthe inmates are locked into their cells most of the time except for mandated services and hygienic\nreasons, there appears to have been an extraordinary amount of assault on staff/use of force reports\nsince its conception [sic]....\"))\n9.  Over the next seven years, the Department's senior officials continued to receive daily reports\nsummarizing the incidents in which CPSU inmates were repeatedly struck and seriously injured\nby correction officers who claimed to be using force in self defense. In addition, these officials\nreceived a number of complaints from inmates in the unit, as well as letters and communications\nfrom the Legal Aid Society and the Board of Correction beginning in 1989, alleging deliberate\nbeatings of inmates in the unit. In 1990 and 1992 written reports prepared by the Office of\nCompliance Consultants for Judge Lasker confirmed a pattern of beatings and physical abuse of\ninmates in the unit. Based on interviews with approximately 20 inmates and observations of\ninjuries to inmates, OCC concluded in 1990 that \"there is a basis to the charges that inmates have\nbeen beaten and subjected to humiliating acts by officers working in the CPSU.\" OCC also\nreported that there was a widespread fear of reprisals for reporting misuse of force among the\nCPSU population. OCC staff shared its assessment of staff brutality and intimidation with the\nJATC Warden and CPSU Unit Manager, Jose Viera. (Letter, Mary Jo Mullan to Hon. Morris E.\nLasker, October 16, 1990.) In June, 1992, OCC again reported to Judge Lasker and to the\nDepartment of Correction that, based on interviews with inmates and Department staff, it had\nfound a pattern of inmate abuse in the CPSU. This pattern included \"greeting beat-up[s]\nadministered to inmates who have been admitted to the CPSU for striking an officer or who\ndisplay an attitude that offends officers. In some cases the beat-up will involve acts that do not\nleave scars (e.g., perforated ear drums)... Another practice involves holding an inmate's head in\nthe toilet bowl while flushing the toilet.\" (Letter, Mary Jo Mullan to Judge Lasker, June 28, 1992.)\nBoth the October, 1990 and June 1992 OCC reports were the subject of lengthy court conferences\nattended by high-ranking officials from the Department of Correction, including the\nCommissioner, Deputy Commissioners, Division Chiefs and JATC Warden.\n10.  Commencing shortly after the CPSU was opened, central office supervisors were repeatedly\nplaced on notice of the existence of a pattern of excessive and unlawful force by correctional staff\nnot only through the official reports of use of force incidents routed to them, but through\ninformation provided by Department staff members, most notably the reports prepared between\n1992 and 1995 by the Integrity Control Officers (\"ICO\") assigned to the CPSU; by Assistant\nCommissioner Toni V. Bair, whose April, 1992 memorandum to Commissioner Abate read in\npart: \"I know of no other system in the country where there are daily occurrences of inmates being\nstruck in the face numerous times and the correctional officers and captains justifying this\nbehavior by stating that 'they were defending themselves.' Hardly without exception the morning\n24-hour reports chronicle inmate assaults. Legal Aid uses these documents as well as others to\nbring suit against the Department similar to the one at C-76 in 1987. GMDC and JATC are likely\ntargets\"; by the reports in 1990 and 1992 by the federal court's Office of Compliance Consultants;\nand by outside agencies, including the Legal Aid Society and the New York City Board of\nCorrection.\n11.  In December, 1988 Assistant Commissioner Bonnie Nathan was advised by the Department's\nDeputy Director of Investigations, Ralph Mierzejewski, that one CPSU captain, Vinogroski, had\nbeen involved in 19 use of force incidents between November, 1987 and December, 1988 in the\nCPSU (and in JATC's punitive segregation area, which had been made part of the CPSU in March,\n1988). Mierzejewski concluded that Vinogroski was not properly supervising the Unit officers\nassigned to him, and \"possibly condoning unnecessary use of force incidents against inmates.\"\n(Memorandum, Mierzejewski to Nathan, December 9, 1988, Re: Captain Edward Vinogroski.)\n12.  During the first six months an ICO was assigned to JATC, the position was filled by two\nexperienced Correction supervisors, first Assistant Deputy Warden Gloria Hunter, and then her\nsuccessor, Assistant Deputy Warden Melvin Fieramosca. Hunter and Fieramosca reported to\n20 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\ncentral office and, in some cases, to the facility warden: (1) inconsistencies between the force\nreported by officers and the injuries found by medical staff (Memo, Hunter to Suite, October 28,\n1992); (2) that a CPSU inmate who protested the way his property was being handled during a\nsearch was thrown on the ground and struck in the back by Officer Spissinger, after which an\nunidentified captain told the inmate to \"shut up before they send you to Bellevue\" (Memo, Hunter\nto Suite, November 10, 1992); (3) a serious absence of supervision of facility \"probe teams\" when\nthese groups of officers responded to force incidents; (4) that probe team members were wearing\nutility gloves, which were prohibited by Department rules and which inmates alleged were used\nwhen officers beat them; (5) that CPSU officers were working without name plates, contrary to\nDepartment policy; (6) that captains were absent during admission processing and inmate searches\n(Memo, Hunter to Phoenix, November 20, 1992); (7) that an inmate's allegation that he was\npunched and struck in a closed room after an inmate worker was ordered to lock into a janitor's\ncloset was true (Memo, Fieramosca to Rodriguez, December 15,1992); (8) that in 11 days in\nDecember, 1992 there were \"fourteen uses of force, which in the opinion of this writer appears to\nbe a strong reliance on force. It appears that the command's reliance on force is quite significant.\"\n(¡d.)\n1. The Department of Correction installed wall-mounted, time lapse cameras in JATC, and later in\nOBCC, pursuant to the Stipulation and Order of February 21, 1995 in Benjamin v. Jacobson. 75\nCiv. 3073 (MEL). JATC and central office supervisors knew that CPSU staff sabotaged the\nsurveillance cameras in JATC by pointing the cameras at the floor or ceiling, but essentially\nremained passive in the face of this staff subversion. (See, Skinner deposition 165-7, 596-8)\n(Deputy Warden for Security made sure the cameras were properly aligned before leaving the jail,\nand returned the next morning to find that they had been moved; Chief of Security Abruzzo\n\"reamed\" him because of the vandalism); Dash deposition 80-3 (CPSU commanding officer knew\ncameras were pointing to floors and ceilings).)\n1. Even before the CPSU was opened in 1988, the Department of Correction was on notice through\nfederal court litigation of allegations of widespread misuse of force among correctional staff.\nDuring the three years immediately before the CPSU was established, litigation was being pursued\nagainst the Department challenging systemic correction officer brutality in three of its jail\nfacilities. Fisher v. Koehler, 692 F. Supp. 1519 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), injunction entered, 718 F. Supp.\n1111 (1989), affd., 902 F.2d 2 (2d Cir. 1990) [Correction Institution for Men], Jackson v.\nMontemagno, CV 85-2384 (AS) (Order Approving Stipulation for Entry of Judgement, November\n26, 1991) [Brooklyn House of Detention], Reynolds v. Ward, 81 Civ. 101 (PNL), Order and\nConsent Judgement, October 1, 1990) [Bellevue Prison Psychiatric Ward]. In response to the\nFisher litigation, Richard Koehler, then the Commissioner of Correction, represented in early 1987\nthat the Department would adopt a number of remedial measures to curb the unnecessary and\nexcessive use of force by officers in the jails. Specifically, Koehler represented to Judge Lasker\nthat the Department would, throughout its jails, carefully monitor the use of force by staff through\na computer tracking system devised pursuant to Directive 5003; impose severe discipline,\nincluding suspension and termination, on those staff members involved in misuse of force;\ncommunicate the intent to impose such discipline to jail staff; hold jail commanders responsible\nfor monitoring their subordinates' use of force, and promote supervisors who reduce use of force\nin their commands; improve training of correction staff in alternatives to use of force and\ntechniques of non-injurious use of force; and extend officers' probationary periods with review of\nprobationary evaluations by the Commissioner himself. (See, testimony of Richard J. Koehler,\nFisher v. Koehler. transcript, 3341, 3579, 3600, 3439, 3469, 3566, 3349, 3354, 3376, 3501.)\n2.  During the period 1988—1996, none of these measures, except the lengthening of the probationary\nperiod, was ever implemented or utilized in the CPSU. Despite their knowledge of misuse of force\nand their own promises and their agents' recommendations of remedial measures, defendants\nfailed to do what they knew needed to be done at the CPSU from its inception. This failure\npersisted even after an obvious pattern of excessive and unlawful force had emerged at the CPSU.\n3.  Defendants failed adequately to screen and select officers suitable for assignment to the\nenvironment of the CPSU. Former CPSU officer Alex Padilla described his recruitment to the\nCPSU by the Unit Manager, Deputy Warden Jose Viera, at the Department's Training Academy:\n\"Upon interview, Dep. Viera asked me what am I going to do if an inmate punches me in the face,\n21 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nand I told him I would kick his ass to make sure he doesn't punch me in the face anymore, and\nDep. Viera said all right, you're in, and the next thing you know, sure enough, I was in the CPSU.\"\n(Transcript of May 17 interview at 38.) The Department assigned officers to the CPSU because of\ntheir imposing size (Deposition of CO. Marvin Williams, November 1, 1994 (\"Williams\ndeposition\") 9), so that they could be intimidating to inmates. (Viera deposition 182-3.)\n4.  The Department officials' failure to adopt meaningful and effective measures to curb the abuse of\ninmates was a substantial cause of the continuation of the pattern of staff brutality in the unit.\nIndeed, the pattern of staff misconduct in the CPSU was so often brought to the attention of\nDepartment supervisors between 1988 and 1996, and their failure to implement measures to curb\nthe abuse of inmates so consistent over this period as to support a finding that this continuing\nfailure reflected a deliberate choice by them to allow inmates to be brutalized in order to control\nthem.\n5.  Specifically, the Department's central office supervisors failed to ensure that the Investigation\nDivision competently and effectively investigated use of force incidents in the CPSU, and that the\nfew staff members charged with violating the Department's use of force and reporting directives\nwere adequately disciplined.\n6.  The Department not only failed to effect meaningful discipline on CPSU staff members for\nmisusing forces; it rewarded some. Central office supervisors promoted individuals known to have\nbeen involved in questionable or suspicious use of force incidents, or suspected of having allowed\ninmates under their supervision to be beaten. These supervisors staffed the CPSU in part with\nofficers and captains whose employment histories documented their refusal to conform their\nconduct to the Department's use of force policy, and/or to report their conduct truthfully. These\ntransfer and promotion decisions led CPSU staff to realize that violating the use of force policy\nwould have no adverse career consequences. These transfer and promotion decisions were a\nsubstantial factor in perpetuating the pattern of staff misconduct in the Unit.\n7. Moreover, probationary officers and captains in the CPSU who were disciplined for violations of\nthe Department's use of force and reporting directives were allowed to remain with the\nDepartment and become tenured employees. Several supervisors who were charged with violating\nDepartment policies in connection with use of force incidents in the CPSU were subsequently\npromoted.\n1. Even though Department supervisors knew as early as 1989 that certain officers and captains were\nfrequently and repeatedly involved in use of force incidents in the CPSU in which inmates were\nseriously injured, it was not until late 1995--in response to this litigation—that the Department\ntransferred staff members from the Unit because of their use of force activity, and thereafter\nrelocated the Unit to OBCC.\nLack of Use of Force Training\n1. Staff members assigned to the CPSU relied on \"street fighting\" techniques, primarily punches,\nstrikes and blows, when they applied force to inmates. Although its written policy purports to\nrequire staff to restrain inmates using holds and other non-injurious force, the Department of\nCorrection does not adequately train its uniformed staff in how to restrain inmates without\nresorting to injurious force, i.e. punches, strikes and blows. This failure to ensure that line staff\nused force properly and in compliance with DOC policy was consistent with the more general\npattern of failure to supervise line staff and enforce DOC policy in the operations of the CPSU\nwhich I have described above.\n2.  It is common knowledge in the supervisory ranks of the Department of Correction that uniformed\nstaff are inadequately trained in how to restrain inmates utilizing non-injurious force. Moreover,\nthe City of New York has refused to budget sufficient funds to enable the Department of\nCorrection to provide adequate training to uniformed staff in how to restrain inmates utilizing\nnon-injurious force.\n3.  Chief of Department Eric Taylor, the Department's highest ranking uniformed officer, testified\nthat the Department's training in non-injurious use of force, such as body holds and restraining\ntechniques, is inadequate to allow officers to use holds spontaneously without first resorting to\npunches. (Deposition of Chief Eric Taylor, May 2, 1997 (\"Taylor deposition\") 97.) Taylor had\nbeen told that there is no money to provide regular, on-going training to uniformed staff in using\n22 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23¯ (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nnon-injurious force, and for that reason it had not been provided to CPSU staff. (Taylor deposition\n100, 102-6.)\n4.  Deputy Warden Dash, who was the CPSU's commanding officer in 1995, testified that\nDepartment of Correction staff are not adequately trained in using non-injurious force, although\nthe Department's formal use of force policy discourages them from striking inmates in the head or\nface. (Dash deposition 178.) Dash agreed with plaintiffs' counsel that more likely than not, the\nreason why CPSU officers punched and struck inmates as frequently as they did was because they\nreceived inadequate training in non-injurious forms of self-defense. (Dash deposition 179-180.) In\nDash's opinion, the '\"few hours' training\" that officers receive in non-injurious self defense is not\n\"realistic\" preparation for jail experience. (Dash deposition 178, 180-1.) He agreed that the\nDepartment of Correction does not provide consistent training in non-injurious forms of\nself-defense; nor does it consistently hold staff responsible when they violate its policies. (Dash\ndeposition 182-3.) Effective training could have an impact on curbing brutality, but \"it's not the\ntraining alone, it's the mindset.\" (Dash deposition 182.)\n5.  Dash's predecessor as the CPSU commanding officer, Deputy Warden Walter Johnson, testified\nthat it was his belief that the training provided to New York City correction officers in applying\nnon-injurious force is not adequate. (Deposition of Walter Johnson, February 6, 19, 1997\n(\"Johnson deposition\") 437.) That inadequacy is in part the reason why officers used force as\nfrequently and severely as they did in the CPSU. (Johnson deposition 438.)\n6.  Terrence Skinner, the Deputy Warden for Security at JATC in 1994-5, testified that he \"did not\nhave properly trained officers\" in the CPSU when he was assigned to JATC. (Skinner deposition\n413.)\n7. At his deposition, Skinner testified to his belief that the uniformed staff in the Department had to\nbe closely monitored and trained; they had to be guided \"all the time.\" \"You can't guide them\ntoday, because tomorrow if you don't tell them to turn left they're going to go straight. They have\nto turn left every day, but if you don't tell them to turn left, they're not going to turn left.\" (Skinner\ndeposition 123.) \"Things have been happening for years, so you have to drill things in and change\nthe mentality.\" (Skinner deposition 170.)\nThe CPSU at OBCC: March 10. 1996-present\nThe Continuation of the Pattern of Misuse of Force\n1. After the relocation of the CPSU to OBCC, the pattern of misuse of force continued. Indeed,\nvideotapes of a number of incidents in 1996 established that staff initiated the application of force\n(see, e.g., UOF 621/96 [Cpt. Trinidad/inmate Escalante], UOF 712/96 CO. Britt/inmate\nAnderson], UOF 1811/96 [inmate Pemberton] and/or falsely reported the incident (see, e.g., UOF\n1011/96 [Wayne Gardine], UOF 1171/96 [Alberto Muniz], UOF 1747/96 [inmate Smalls]). The\nscenarios in which force was misused in OBCC were different from those which had been\nemployed at JATC. Four factors contributed to the change in the manner in which force was\nmisused. First, the CPSU housing areas were subject to video surveillance by wall-mounted\ncameras located in the nine housing areas of the Unit and in the elevators. Significantly, no\ncameras were installed in the elevator lobbies. A number of incidents in which staff misused force\noccurred in areas removed from view of the cameras, such as the elevator lobbies, inmates' cells\nand facility receiving rooms. Second, beginning shortly after the Unit's relocation, all CPSU\ninmates were rear-cuffed whenever they left their cells. A number of inmates were struck in the\nface and head while cuffed, or pushed head-first into the walls while rear-cuffed (see, e.g.,\nvideotapes of UOF 438/96 [baton blows on handcuffed inmate in yard], UOF 512/96, 939/96\n1171/96 [cuffed inmates pushed violently into wall], UOF 1141/96 [cuffed inmate pushed into cell\nand then struck off-camera]. Third, all OBCC CPSU staff were authorized to administer tear gas,\nand were equipped with hand-held aerosol gas dispensers. A number of CPSU inmates were\ngassed while cuffed, in their cells, or under other circumstances in which the use of chemical\nagents was abusive. Fourth, at OBCC captains were directly involved in striking inmates,\nsupervising incidents in which blatant security breaches (e.g. inmates moving cuffed hands from\nthe rear to the front with no preventive action by staff) precipitated the use of force, and in failing\nto utilize the hand-held video camera to record applications of force that were clearly anticipated,\nas required by Department policy.\n23 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n2.  Between March 9 and December 31, 1996 there were 264 reported use of force \"incidents\" or\nallegations of use of force reported to DOC staff involving CPSU inmates in OBCC. This number\nwas far in excess of the yearly totals of use of force incidents in the CPSU when it was housed in\nJATC. Some of the 264 reported use of force incidents involved the application of force to more\nthan one inmate. Altogether, there were 373 inmates involved in use of force incidents in the\nCPSU between March 10 and December 31, 1996.\n3.  At OBCC, CPSU staff continued to routinely employ unwarranted, unnecessary and excessive\nforce as a means to punish and control inmates, and to retaliate against them for perceived\nwrongdoing. The routine misuse of force was wholly beyond, and out of proportion to, that needed\nto maintain order in the CPSU. The misuse of force routinely and inevitably inflicted serious\ninjury and pain on inmates confined to the Unit. A list of some of the CPSU inmates who were\ninjured by Department of Correction staff in use of force incidents in the OBCC CPSU is attached\nto this Declaration as Exhibit 3. There were 101 use of force incidents—almost forty percent of the\ntotal number of \"use of force incidents\" in the CPSU in 1996--in which, according to Department\nof Correction records, staff reported striking or punching an inmate with their fists, or with a\nbaton, or the inmate alleged to Department staff that he was struck by fists, feet or a baton. Many\nof these incidents occurred during \"cell extractions\" which in other correctional systems are\neffected with techniques that are intended to gain quick control of an inmate with minimal\ninjurious force.\n4.  Evidence of this pattern was manifest both in the institutions's records (use of force packages,\nvideotapes) and in the sheer number of incidents and the frequency and severity of inmate injuries,\nespecially injuries to the face and head. Indeed, multiple head injuries sustained by inmates in\nroutine applications of force in the CPSU was so commonplace as to constitute a clear pattern and\npractice of the utilization of techniques intended to harm and punish, rather than restrain and\ncontrol, inmates.\n5.  At OBCC there was a conspicuous pattern of inmates being struck in the face and head while in\nhandcuffs and of inmates being struck in the face and head in locations that could not be observed\nby inmate witnesses and were not subject to video surveillance, e.g., cells, elevator lobbies and\nintake areas. Staff evaded and sabotaged the surveillance cameras that were installed precisely for\nthe purpose of helping to control the misuse of force. In at least fifty use of force incidents in the\nCPSU in 1996, inmates were struck or otherwise injured (e.g., pushed to the floor) by correction\nstaff while they were handcuffed, almost always with their hands behind their backs.\n6.  Staff used force when none was needed, e.g., initiating force in response to verbal misconduct or\nother acts of defiance. A number of inmates suffered head and face injuries in the CPSU when\nstruck by staff in the course of cell extractions performed to remove inmates from their cells under\ncircumstances in which they could and should have been allowed to remain in the cell, or should\nhave been removed without being struck repeatedly in the face and/or head. In other incidents,\nwhen some force may have been justified, staff used excessive force that was intended to cause\npain and injury rather than in a good faith effort to maintain order.\n7.  Staff manufactured occasions for the use of force by creating security breaches, e.g. allowing\ninmates to move their cuffed hands from the rear to the front; entering cells of defiant inmates\nwho had not been restrained; escorting inmates after incidents without adequate restraints; opening\ncells and allowing the inmate to walk unescorted on the tier. There were a number of use of force\nincidents in the CPSU which reportedly began when the inmate freed himself from cuffs, attacked\ngroups of staff, and was then restrained with multiple punches to the face, head and body. Most of\nthese incidents were reported in areas of the facility not covered by video surveillance cameras.\n8.  CPSU staff used chemical agents frequently. In a five-month period between April and August,\n1996, there were 118 Class A use of force incidents in the CPSU, 96 of which (81%) involved the\nuse of mace. (Memorandum, Warden Ortiz to Chief Haughton, September 4, 1996, Statistics for\nMarch through August, 1996 Re: Class A Use of Force.) In OBCC, staff used chemical agents\nunder highly questionable circumstances: on inmates whose hands were cuffed behind their backs;\nto \"effect a transfer\" of an inmate; in response to verbal abuse; on inmates in locked cells; on an\ninmate with a cane who refused to wear leg shackles or to return to his cell; and on an asthmatic\ninmate locked in his cell.\n9.  Staff continued to cover up their misconduct. Staff submitted false reports, and frequently used\nrote and specious reasons to justify the applications of force in which multiple and serious injuries\nresulted. Most commonly, they reported that they used minimal force to restrain an inmate in\n24 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\ndefense of themselves when, in fact, they initiated force to assault the inmate, and to inflict pain\nand injury. In a number of cases, the fraudulent and dishonest nature of the staff use of force\nreports was obvious when the videotape of the incident was viewed. In some cases staff failed to\nreport the use of force at all.\n10. At OBCC staff flouted or subverted Department orders requiring the use of hand-held video\ncameras to record anticipated use of force incidents, such as cell extractions. At OBCC there was a\nconsistent failure to utilize a hand-held video camera to record incidents in which the use of force\nwas reasonably anticipated. When a hand-held camera was brought to the scene of a use of force,\nstaff routinely failed to record the actual use of force by delaying the filming until the force had\nalready been utilized, or using the camera improperly, or obstructing the view of the camera. Even\nafter the CPSU Unit Manager advised his subordinates in May, 1996 of the requirement that a\nhand-held camera be used to videotape anticipated uses of force, neither the CPSU Tour\nCommanders nor other staff complied with the order. Between May 10 and August 1, 1996,\nDepartment of Correction records reflect that CPSU staff entered inmates' cells, or used force\nelsewhere, under circumstances when force could reasonably have been anticipated, but no video\ncamera was utilized. It was not until after a second memorandum from the CPSU Unit Manager,\nissued on August 6 ,1996— after the Legal Aid Society advised the Commissioner that unit and\nfacility staff were continuing to violate the video taping directive— that CPSU staff began to\nutilize the hand-held video camera to tape cell extractions.\nThe Role of OBCC and Central Office Supervisors\n1. As they had at JATC, CPSU and OBCC supervisors, as well as central office administrators,\nroutinely and consistently approved the use of punches and blows to inmates' faces and\nheads—including many inmates who were handcuffed when struck- whenever staff justified the\napplication of force as necessary in \"self defense.\" CPSU and jail supervisors, as well as central\noffice administrators, also knew that officers continued to prepare their use of force and witness\nreports collusively. These same supervisors routinely credited the officers' accounts of use of force\nincidents because their reports were \"consistent.\"\n2.  Although the transfer of the CPSU to OBCC was prompted by this litigation and the\nacknowledged existence of a pattern of misuse of force, and its cover up, at JATC, neither\nsupervisory staff in OBCC nor executive staff in DOC's central office made any significant  efforts\nto determine whether that pattern had been ended by the transfer to OBCC. After the CPSU was\nmoved to OBCC, the pattern of supervisory knowledge of, acquiescence in, and \"turning a blind\neye\" towards the misuse of force continued.\n3.  OBCC and CPSU supervisors reviewed the \"preliminary reports\" of use of force incidents in the\nCPSU, and the Commissioner read the \"CCC\" or \"24 hour reports\" documenting use of force in\nthe Unit. These sketchy reports identified the location of the incidents and summarized the\nsequence of events leading to the application of force, as well as the participants' injuries.\nSupervisors who read these reports knew that in 1996 numerous CPSU inmates were being\npunched and struck in areas not covered by the wall-mounted video cameras, such as elevator\nlobbies and inside cells; struck and punched while they were handcuffed and being moved from\ntheir cells; struck with batons in the head and face; and punched and struck after freeing\nthemselves from handcuffs. They also knew of the number of inmates maced by officers in the\nCPSU to whom hand-held gas canisters had been distributed shortly after the Unit was relocated.\n4.  Yet the OBCC Warden and CPSU Unit Manager, astonishingly, refused to read the actual reports\nof \"Class A\" use force incidents and to routinely review videotaped use of force incidents,\nalthough the Commissioner expected them to; the Commissioner only learned some time later that\nthey were not reading the reports and viewing the tapes. (Jacobson deposition 29-30, 55-6.)\nSimilarly, although the Commissioner expected the Integrity Control Officer assigned to the\nCPSU to routinely review use of force incidents and view the videotapes, he only learned after the\nfact that she was not doing so. (Jacobson deposition 434, 57.) The Division Chief, who had\noversight responsibilities with respect to the CPSU, also did not read the use of force packages,\nand the Commissioner was not informed of this. (Jacobson deposition 32, deposition of Division\nChief Milton Haughton, August 28, 1997 (\"Haughton deposition\") 73-77.)\n5. The fact that the OBCC Warden and CPSU Unit Manager refused to routinely read the use of\nforce reports—although they each signed them—and view the videotaped incidents underscored yet\n25 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nagain how willing high-ranking Department officials were to turn a blind eye towards events in\nthe CPSU. Warden Robert Ortiz had been informed shortly after he assumed his position, by\nthen-Deputy Commissioner Kerik, of the pattern of staff misconduct in the CPSU which led to the\nUnit's being relocated to his command. (Deposition of then-First Deputy Commissioner Kerik,\nFebruary 27,1997 (\"Kerik deposition\") 157.) Assistant Chief Milton Haughton, Ortiz1 immediate\nsupervisor, rebuked Ortiz in June, 1996, for recent \"violent incidents among staff and inmates\nwhich raised questions concerning proper leadership within the facility.\" (Memo, Haughton to\nOrtiz, June 17, 1996.)\n6.  Central office supervisors, who reviewed the \"24 hour reports\" from the jails, had general\nknowledge of the frequency and severity of injuries sustained by CPSU inmates after being struck\nby staff (as they had during the years the CPSU was located at JATC; see, Memorandum,\nAssistant Commissioner Toni V. Bair to Commissioner Catherine Abate, April, 1992 [discussed at\n¶ 68, supra]. However, no one in the Commissioner's or Chief of Department's office routinely\nand consistently reviewed the use of force packages~which contained more detailed information\nabout the inmate injuries and the course of the incidents—until September, 1996, when Division\nChief Haughton, the Warden's immediate supervisor, had the reports sent to him. (This followed\nthe Legal Aid Society's detailed letter of July 31,1996 to Commissioner Jacobson, in which we\nadvised the Commissioner of a number of use of force incidents in the CPSU in which handcuffed\ninmates were struck in the face and head, often outside the view of wall-mounted cameras. See, ¶\n103.) The failure to review the contents of the packages appeared to reflect a deliberate intention\nto avoid knowledge of the contents of the reports.\n7. Although the formal reports of use of force incidents were routed both to supervisory staff in\nOBCC and executive staff in the Department's central office, nobody reacted or responded to the\npatterns in which force was being used in the Unit until plaintiffs' counsel wrote to the\nCommissioner on July 31, 1996. In that letter, the Commissioner was advised of a number of\ninmates who had suffered head and face injuries when struck by CPSU staff, many of them in\nhandcuffs and in areas not covered by the wall-mounted surveillance cameras. The Commissioner\nwas also advised that there had emerged in the CPSU an identifiable group of captains and officers\nfrequently involved in use of force incidents in which inmates were seriously injured. Prior to his\nreceipt of the July 31 letter, the Commissioner was not aware of the fact that CPSU inmates had\nbeen struck by staff while handcuffed behind their back. (Jacobson deposition 45.)\n8.  Throughout 1996 and continuing into 1997, OBCC and central office supervisors ignored obvious\npatterns of staff practices which warranted review, investigation and follow-up. These patterns of\nuse of force were readily discernible from at least a review of the 24 hour reports, as well as a\nreview of the use of force packages and videotapes. These patterns included: the frequency of\nserious head and face injuries inflicted on inmates in use of force incidents; reported blows to\ninmates being escorted out of their cells, who were presumably handcuffed pursuant to\nDepartment policy; the use of the poly-carbon shield used in cell extractions to strike inmates in\nthe face and head; unexplained multiple inmate injuries; frequent incidents of force involving the\nsame personnel; frequent incidents involving locations in the jail outside of camera range; and\nfrequent administration of chemical agents on inmates in locked cells who had refused or defied\norders.\n9.  Had the facility Integrity Control Officer, CPSU Unit Manager and OBCC Warden been\nreviewing videotapes of use of force incidents in the CPSU and reading use of force reports, they\nwould have confronted a number of instances of false reporting of use of force incidents by\ncaptains and officers. They would also have become aware of a number of incidents in which staff\nstruck handcuffed inmates to the face and head.\n10.  Central office officials received information in 1996 regarding continuing violations of use of\nforce investigation policies. The Commissioner, Chief, and Division Chief knew in the spring of\n1996 that CPSU staff were failing to use the hand-held video camera to film use of force in\ninmates' cells; from a review of the \"24 hour reports\" they knew that several captains and a group\nof correction officers were involved in a disproportionate number of use of force incidents in\nwhich inmates suffered serious injuries; they knew that staff used force in areas of the CPSU that\nwere not covered by the wall-mounted video cameras and that staff struck and punched inmates,\nwhose hands were cuffed behind their backs, in the face and head. Yet they took no reasonable or\nmeaningful steps to protect CPSU inmates from the continuing infliction of injury at the hands of\nUnit staff.\n26 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n11.  Commissioner Jacobson had become aware of the pattern of excessive force and falsification of\ndocuments, and of the more general breakdown in supervision and oversight, in the JATC CPSU\nin August or September, 1995 (Jacobson deposition 39-40). He, like his predecessors, continued\nthereafter to rely on his subordinates to deal with the use of force issue in the CPSU. He assumed\nthat these subordinates would ensure that the misuse of force and its false reporting would not\nrecur, although he failed to hold them accountable for what actually occurred in the CPSU. Like\nhis predecessors, he failed to ensure that these subordinates provided him with a regular flow of\naccurate information concerning the indicia of unnecessary and excessive force. He continued to\nfail to provide the level of personal attention and commitment to reform the misuse of force\nproblem warranted; he failed to take decisive action in the face of what he knew were serious\nviolations of the Department's use of force policy; he ignored readily available evidence that\nunnecessary and excessive force continued to pervade the Unit's operations.\n12. Although the Commissioner and members of his executive staff met regularly with facility and\nUnit supervisors to discuss the CPSU, they focused their attention on the numbers of use of force\nincidents, and not on the officers' conduct and the inmate injuries. OBCC and Unit staff who met\nwith the Commissioner and his executive staff did not inform the central office supervisors of the\ntype and severity of force that was being utilized in the CSPU, and with what consequences. As a\nresult of the Commissioner's and his staffs' unwillingness to confront how force was being used in\nthe unit, and what injuries were being inflicted on inmates, CPSU staff continued to use force to\ninjure inmates under the same circumstances as they had consistently done.\n13.  When he testified at his deposition in October, 1997, Commissioner Jacobson characterized the\nCPSU as a \"very well run unit.\" (Jacobson deposition 173.) But, he was unaware as late as\nOctober, 1997 how many CPSU inmates were subjected to force while in handcuffs. (Jacobson\ndeposition 214 (\"It's not my practice to essentially micromanage the unit.\").) Nor did he know\nwho in central office or at the jail read the use of force packages. For some time he had not known\nthat the former Warden and Unit manager had not routinely read the class A use of force\npackages; Jacobson had assumed that they had. (Jacobson deposition 27-32, 97-8.) The\nCommissioner assumed that the successor Warden was reading the use of force packages and\nreviewing the videotapes. (Jacobson deposition 28, 57.) He was unaware that inmates in the CPSU\nin 1996 and 1997 continued to suffer perforated eardrums (four inmates were reported to have\nsuffered perforated eardrums in use of force incidents between November, 1996 and April, 1997),\nalthough he believed that he should have been informed of this; he did not know that a perforated\neardrum sustained from the application of force necessarily reflected a targeted blow to the ear\nalthough he recognized that injury as having been \"associated\" with use of force in the JATC\nCPSU. (Jacobson deposition 207-10.) The Commissioner was not informed of the nature of the\ninjuries inmates sustained in cell extractions and other use of force incidents in the CPSU; he was\nnot informed of whether incidents took place in view of the wall-mounted cameras. (Jacobson\ndeposition 60-62.) The Commissioner did not know how members of the Emergency Response\nUnit were screened before being selected to work in that unit, but knew that the ERU included\nsome members of the uniformed staff who had not been allowed to work in the OBCC CPSU\nbecause of their prior assignment to the CPSU at JATC. He did not know whether staff members\nwere allowed under Department policy to confer with each other when writing use of force\nreports. (Jacobson deposition 84-6, 412.)\n14. Although he believed that any staff member who falsified a use of force report should receive\nsome form of discipline for this \"serious violation,\" this was not the agency practice, and the\nCommissioner was unaware of it. (Jacobson deposition 424.) Nor was the Commissioner\naware—until his deposition in October, 1997— that a number of videotapes showing captains and\nofficers using and observing force in the CPSU in 1996 demonstrated that the staff members'\nreports had been falsified. (Jacobson deposition 427-431 (UOF# 1747/96, Samuel Small,\n12/11/96); Id. 141-2 (UOF# 621/96, Reynaldo Escalante, 5/3/96); Id. 245 (UOF# 1171/96, Alberto\nMuniz, 8/12/96).)\n15. The Commissioner never heard of the incident on May 24,1996 (UOF# 752/96) in which two\ninmates were maced while chained to a fence. (Jacobson deposition 176-8.)\n16. The Commission knew in August, 1996, that Warden Ortiz had written a memorandum,\ndescribing an incident captured on videotape, which was inconsistent with the events depicted on\nthe tape. (Jacobson deposition 195-8 (UOF# 1011/96, Wayne Gardine, 7/10/96).) That false report\nwas a factor in the Commissioner's decision to replace Ortiz as the Warden, although he was in\n27 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nfact not replaced until six months later. When Ortiz was replaced, he was transferred to another\njail, lost no pay, and suffered no adverse consequences, even though he had prepared a false report\nabout a use of force incident. (Jacobson deposition 198-203.)\n17. Another factor in the decision to remove Ortiz from OBCC was the information conveyed by the\nLegal Aid Society to First Deputy Commissioner Kerik in late February, 1997: that some CPSU\ninmates were being forced to pay extortion money to inmate food service workers in order to eat,\nand others were being robbed of property stored in lockers in their housing areas. (Jacobson\ndeposition 201.)\n18.  Commissioner Jacobson believed that it is the responsibility of facility and Unit managers to\naddress management and supervision issues with respect to use of force. The Commissioner\ntestified in October, 1997, that he was \"totally convinced\" that OBCC and CPSU supervisors\nmanaged use of force appropriately and adequately, and that they properly monitored and\nsupervised staff use of force since the relocation of the Unit. (Jacobson depo 440.)\n19. Although the Commissioner believed that it was unsatisfactory for an Investigation Division\ninvestigator to close a case without reviewing the videotape (Jacobson deposition 126-7), that was\ndone routinely, and he was not aware of it. Although he believed that Investigation Division\ninvestigators should interview staff members involved in force incidents \"most of the time\"\n(Jacobson deposition 231), they seldom did. The Commissioner was unaware that at the time of\nhis deposition, all of the over one hundred 1996 use of force incidents that had been closed by the\nInvestigation Division had been closed without any staff interviews. (Jacobson deposition 239.)\n20.  Although the Commissioner testified in October, 1997, that he had \"a tremendous amount of\nconfidence in the Investigation unit and the person and the people who head it\" (Jacobson\ndeposition 377-8), he fired the unit supervisor two weeks after the deposition.\n21.  The Commissioner was unable or unwilling to ensure that decisions he made with respect to the\nmanagement of force in the CPSU were actually complied with. For example, he decided in July\nor August, 1997 that cell extractions performed by the Emergency Response Unit should be\nvideotaped by officers capable of recording the events. (There is an institutional order requiring\nthat cell extractions be videotaped, which OBCC staff did not begin to comply with until late\nsummer, 1996; however, ERU staff were not videotaped pursuant to this order when they\nconducted extractions in the CPSU.) Subsequently, he was told by his subordinates that the\nextractions were being videotaped, but in fact they were not. (Jacobson deposition 333-350, 368,\n384-5.) The Commissioner in 1996 was at first not made aware that facility staff were not using\nthe hand-held video camera; he was then told that it was being used consistent with policy, when\nit was not. (Jacobson deposition 49-50, 52,150.) Nor was the Commissioner informed that OBCC\nstaff, even in August and September, 1997, continued to fail to use the hand-held video camera in\nsituations when they were required to. (Jacobson deposition 313-4.)\nThe Department of Correction's Use of Force Policy\n1. The Department's Directive 5005 prohibits the use of force to punish, discipline or retaliate against\nan inmate, and requires the use of graduated force by staff in responding to inmate misconduct.\n2.  But while force may not be used to discipline an inmate for failing to obey an order, the Directive\non its face permits force to be used to \"enforce Department/facility rules and court orders.\" As\nplaintiffs' expert Vincent Nathan reported, \"this is a generalization through which CPSU staff have\ndriven an engine of terror, as the standard response to an inmate's failure to obey an order is the\nuse of unnecessary or excessive force.\" (Report of Plaintiffs' Expert Vincent Nathan, December 1,\n1997 at 20.) And while deadly force, defined as force readily capable of causing \"serious injury or\ndeath,\" is prohibited by the Directive except as a last resort, the Department tolerated multiple\nblows to the face and head-which are obviously capable of causing serious injury or death—as a\nnormal, routine application of force in the CPSU for close to a decade.\n1. Nothing in the Department's use of force reporting requirements, which are also included in\nDirective 5005, required officers to prepare use of force reports independently. (In fact, in 1990,\nwhen it negotiated with rioting correction officers who had seized the Rikers Island Bridge in\nprotest against the Department's use of force policy, the City entered into the so-called \"Bridge\nAgreement\" and agreed that \"correction officers shall be allowed the assistance of fellow\nemployees and union representatives when writing reports. . . The Department has agreed to allow\n28 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\ndelegates to assist correction officers when they are ordered to write reports.\") The practice in the\nCPSU was for staff to prepare the reports collusively, thus ensuring their consistency. (See.\nMojica deposition 184; Viera deposition 272-3, 361, 600; Skinner deposition 155-6; Hunter\ndeposition 129-30, 373-4; deposition of Captain Richard Pagan, October 13, 1994 (\"Pagan\ndeposition\") 126-7 (former Director of Investigations testified that identical reports are \"normal\"\nand essentially fabricated).)\n1. The Department's Directive 45IORR, governing the use of chemical agents, including mace, failed\nto provide sufficient guidance to line staff concerning the use of hand-held aerosols. As written,\nthis directive explicitly permits staff to gas an inmate if he refuses an order from a Department\nstaff member: \"to enforce Department rules, facility regulations and court orders where necessary\nto promote the good order and safety of the facility.\"\nFailure to Monitor Use of Force\n1. Department Directive 5003, promulgated in November, 1986, requires facility supervisors to\nidentify in a computer database all staff members involved in three or more use of force incidents\nin the preceding calendar quarter. The Directive at IV.C.I requires that facility commanders\n\"review the investigative reports of the pertinent incidents and interview the individual involved to\nascertain whether the force used was necessary to control the environment or whether a pattern of\ninappropriate behavior has emerged.\"\n1. Throughout the CPSU's existence, facility commanders at JATC and OBCC largely ignored\nDirective 5003. At JATC, the computer database did not contain all of the information pertaining\nto use of force incidents that had occurred. Many officers involved in repeated use of force were\nnot interviewed; when interviews were conducted, the task was at times assigned to captains who\nthemselves had used inappropriate force; and the interviews, when they were conducted, were\nconsistently perfunctory and undertaken without any reference to the written reports concerning\nthe force incidents. (See. Herrera deposition 67, 117-8; deposition of Officer Alvan Ramsey,\nMarch 16, 1995 (\"Ramsey deposition\") 91-2; deposition of Officer Eddie Vasquez, June 21, 1994\n(\"Vasquez deposition\") 58, 61-2, 91-2, 108-9 (no interviews conducted); Skinner deposition\n143-4, 236 (delegating interviews to captains in spite of the fact that \"there wasn't a captain in the\njail who wasn't\" involved in repeated use of force); deposition of Deputy Warden and CPSU Unit\nManager (1996) Albert Rodriguez, December 3-4, 1996 (\"Rodriguez deposition\") 164 (interviews\nconducted without utilizing videotapes of the incidents being reviewed).) Supervisors failed to\nutilize the information available from the Directive 5003 review process to order re-training of\nCPSU staff, to transfer staff from the CPSU, and in making assignments in the CPSU, and failed\nto utilize the information available from the Directive 5003 review process in selecting staff to\nwork in the CPSU.\n2.  In 1994 and 1995, the CPSU Integrity Control Officer repeatedly made central office supervisors\naware of the fact that the JATC administration was not in compliance with Directive 5003. (See,\nMemoranda, Hunter to Suite, March 11, 1994; Hunter to Kerik, May 26, 1994; Hunter to Rigby,\nJune 29, 1994; ICO monthly reports, Thomas to Loconsolo (May through November, 1995).)\nInvestigation Division Use of Force Investigations\n1. Correction officer investigators and civilian investigators assigned to the Department's central\noffice Investigations Division conducted investigations of use of force incidents in the CPSU\npursuant to case-opening criteria set out in the Department's \"Manual on the Conduct of Use of\nForce Investigations.\" This investigation was done either simultaneous with or (more often) after\nthe facility conducted its investigation. According to the documents provided in discovery, the\nInvestigations Division reviewed 46% (492 out of 1062) of the use of force incidents in the CPSU\nbetween 1988 and 1995. After the Unit was relocated to OBCC, all use of force incidents, then all\nclass A use of force incidents (those involving more serious injuries and those in which chemical\nagents were deployed) in the CPSU were investigated solely by the Investigation Division; later in\n1996, the Investigation Division again assumed responsibility for investigating all use of force\nincidents in the Unit and the facility was no longer responsible for any investigations.\n29 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n2.  From 1988 through 1997, investigations conducted by the Department of Correction's\nInvestigation Division (\"ID\") were consistently deficient. Plaintiffs reviewed approximately 678\ninvestigative files prepared by ID in connection with use of force incidents in the CPSU, as well as\n264 Incident Review Team reviews of facility investigations. These documents clearly establish\nthat there was a long-standing failure to conduct professional, competent investigations of use of\nforce incidents in the Unit: investigations often parroted the facility investigations and failed to\nevaluate fairly inmate witness statements. ID investigations rarely challenged officers' assertions\nthat the force applied was \"reasonable\" or \"minimal\" or in \"self defense.\" ID investigations were\nroutinely closed based on a \"finding\" that the force reported was consistent with the injuries to the\ninmate, even when there was no substantive information in the investigation file concerning how\nan injury, such as a perforated eardrum or fracture, could have been inflicted. (It was not the\npractice in the Investigation Division to obtain an opinion from a medical professional to\ndetermine what type or amount of force would explain an injury.) So long as the facility staff\nreported that they used force in a type and quantity that the investigator believed—based on no\nmedical or forensic information—was sufficient to explain the injury, the \"investigation\" was\nalmost always closed without charges. In those cases where the use of some force may have been\njustified, ID routinely failed to address whether the force used was excessive. In numerous\nincidents in which CPSU officers reported that they responded \"spontaneously\" with punches to\nthe inmate's face, head or body, the officer's version of events was accepted unless there was\nincontrovertible evidence, such as a bootprint on an inmate's face, to the contrary.\n1. Specifically, ID investigations of use of force incidents in the CPSU demonstrated the following\ndeficiencies: (1) inadequate or biased assessment of medical evidence by investigators, including\nfailures to note the presence of serious injuries inflicted on inmates, the absence of injuries to staff\nconsistent with their account of events, and the prevalence of head injuries to inmates; (2) failure\nby investigators to pursue obvious leads, e.g., the involvement of staff members whose presence is\nnot acknowledged in the reports, and the occurrence of prior incidents which an inmate suggested\nmotivated the 'beat-up,' and failures to identify and interview inmate witnesses; (3) failure by\ninvestigators to note patterns in the locations where uses of force occurred, failure to note the\nrepeated use of force by certain CPSU officers and the repeated use of force on tours supervised\nby certain captains, and an egregious failure to note the unmistakable pattern of perforated\neardrums sustained by inmates injured in use of force incidents in the CPSU (35 perforated\neardrums reported in Department of Correction or New York City Correctional Health Services\nmedical records between August, 1989 and April, 1997); (4) the use of different standards by\ninvestigators when evaluating inmate statements and correction officer reports (there was a\nconspicuous unwillingness by ID investigators to credit inmate statements, and an equally\nconspicuous failure to note contradictions, omissions of detail and suspicious similarities in\nofficers' reports) and when interpreting the presence or lack of injuries to inmates and staff; (5)\njustification of uses of force with boilerplate language stating that force was \"minimal and\nnecessary\" or \"within Department guidelines\" without ever pursuing whether there was an\nalternative to force, or whether the force used was excessive or otherwise did not comply with\nDepartment policy; (6) adoption of staff written reports without learning, through staff interviews,\nthe details surrounding an incident; (7) failure to watch the videotape of an incident to determine\nwhat occurred and whether it was reported truthfully; and (8) failure to complete investigations\nwithin the required time limit or within any reasonable amount of time.\n1. In some cases, the unwillingness of the Investigation Division to confront\nobvious evidence of staff misuse of force produced ludicrous results. In one case, involving an incident\nin April, 1994, an ID investigator personally witnessed one officer kick an inmate in the head while the\ninmate was lying supine on the floor, and witnessed other officers have to restrain the offending  officer.\nThe investigator assigned to prepare the ID \"investigative report,\" formulated the following version of\nthe incident: \"Based on a statement from Dr. Delacruz, Officer Merrit may have lost temporary control\nof his faculties as a result of the incident he was involved in which eventually led him to having seizures\nand as staff reported, being found in an unconscious state at the scene. . . Officer Merrit may have, in\nfact, kicked an inmate as reported by Investigator Isaac yet not in control of his actions\" [sic]. (ID file,\nUOF# 451/94, Jose O'Neal, 4/13/94.) In a 1991 incident involving named plaintiff Carl Brown, the\n30 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\ninvestigator concluded that the inmate's injuries were not consistent with an allegation of an unreported\nbeating. (ID file, UOF# 990/91, Carl Brown, 7/9/91.) Mr. Brown, in addition to a perforated eardrum,\nsuffered bruises to his face, ear and ribs, orbital tenderness, a fractured nose, and other injuries.\n1. In some cases in which CPSU inmates were seriously injured by staff members, the Investigation\nDivision failed to conduct any investigation at all. On February 1, 1996 in JATC, nineteen CPSU\ninmates were forcibly extracted from their cells, and a number of them suffered multiple\ncontusions and lacerations. Later that day, Warden Fraser suspended the Tour Commander, ADW\nCaliendo, for \"failing to make proper notification in a proper time frame and calling in the unusual\nincident erroneously and omitting pertinent facts of the incident. He also failed to control the\nproper dispatch and monitoring of injured staff to hospitals.\" (Memorandum, William J. Fraser to\nCommissioner Michael P. Jacobson, February 2, 1996.) No facility unusual incident or use of\nforce package was prepared in connection with this incident, and the Department's Investigation\nDivision had not completed an investigation of the incident as of June, 1998. Similarly, no ID\ninvestigation was ever conducted concerning the March 23, 1995 incident in which Pedro Diegues\nsuffered extensive facial trauma and was hospitalized for several weeks thereafter.\n2.  Throughout the history of the CPSU there has been a substantial backlog of investigations of uses\nof force, and an inability or unwillingness by the Investigations Division to complete\ninvestigations in a timely manner. Since 1992 the delay in completing investigations cases has\nworsened. In 1996 approximately a third of the investigations were at least 60 days late, and\nremained open 3 months after the date of the incident. As of June, 1998 there were still 1996 ID\ninvestigations that are uncompleted; all of the these are now at least 15 months late.\n3.  The Department of Correction did not complete its investigations of many of the most egregious\n1996 cases— in which OBCC CPSU supervisors and officers used unnecessary and/or excessive\nforce, and then prepared false reports—until a year or more after the incident, even though\nvideotapes existed which corroborated the inmates' accounts and/or discredited the officers'. See,\nfor example, disciplinary files in connection with:\n4.  inmate Hubert Carey incident, April 17, 1996, UOF 512/96; three officers seen on tape striking\nand kicking inmate; staff not charged until October, 1997;\n5.  inmates Shane Tate and Tony Starks incident, UOF 605/96, May 2, 1996; officers seen on tape\ninitiating assault on each inmate (contrary to their written reports); not charged until April, 1997;\n6.  inmate Melvin Anderson incident, May 20, 1996, UOF 712/96; officer seen on tape assaulting\ninmate, assault then joined by two other officers; charges filed August, 1997 against staff for\nimpermissible force and false reporting;\n7.  inmate Wayne Gardine incident, July 10, 1996, UOF 1011/96; staff seen on videotape surrounding\ninmate dumped from laundry cart, charges filed August, 1997;\n8.  inmate Alberto Muniz incident, August 12, 1996, staff seen on videotape initiating assault,\ncontrary to written report, charges approved January, 1998.\n1. On May 12, 1998 the Investigation Division closed its investigation of a June 25,1996 use of\nforce incident in which two CPSU inmates suffered blunt force trauma when Unit captains and\nofficers struck Jerome Johnson repeatedly in the head, and punched Robert Elliot, who was\nhandcuffed in the rear, about the face and head and then slammed him face-first into an elevator\ndoor. Johnson sustained two lacerations to the left brow and swelling of the jaw, and when\nexamined in a hospital emergency room had blood in both ear canals. Elliot had bruising over the\nhead, face, neck and both shoulders, and loose teeth. Johnson alleged that Captain Labruzzo, the\nCPSU Security Captain, had broken a baton over his head; video tapes reviewed by the\nInvestigation Division showed Labruzzo carrying a baton, and an officer carrying a broken baton\nafter Johnson had been removed from the housing area. (The broken baton was never recovered\nduring the investigation.) Video tape also showed Elliott's face striking the inside of the elevator\ndoor. Three CPSU captains~Labruzzo, Lanza and Ferraiuolo-and three CPSU officers were\ncharged with using impermissible force and filing false reports in this incident. This June 25, 1996\nincident was one of the many incidents which plaintiffs' counsel had, by letter of July 31, 1996,\nbrought to the Commissioner's attention. See, ¶ 103, supra.\n2.  Other systemic failings which characterized ID activity persisted after the CPSU was relocated to\nOBCC, and after the Investigations Division was assigned exclusive authority to investigate all\nuse of force incidents in the CPSU. Out of the 185 ID files produced for the year 1996, in only\n31 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nforty one were staff interviews conducted, and in only 112 was there an indication that the ID\ninvestigator watched the videotape. (Commissioner Jacobson testified at his deposition that\n\"investigators should always interview staff members involved in the use of force. . . There may\nbe cases where for some reason it's not necessary because the outcome or the evidence on the\nvideotape or something is so clear that they're rendered unnecessary. But I think most of the time\nthat they should.\" (Jacobson deposition 231).) In three of the 185 incidents was there an indication\nthat medical personnel were questioned by ID concerning the medical evidence. Out of the 185\nuse of force incidents, thirty eight involved reports that an inmate possessed a weapon. In only one\nof these cases was an evidence voucher used to secure the weapon. In eleven of those thirty eight\ncases, there was a photocopy of contraband in the ID file that was apparently provided to ID along\nwith the use of force package. In seven of the thirty-eight the facility reports indicate that no\nweapon was recovered. In the remaining eighteen cases the facility reported that a weapon was\nrecovered yet there is no supportive documentation of any kind in the ID file. In twenty five of the\n1996 ID investigation files in which ID recommended disciplinary charges against staff, the 22R\n(Employee Performance Service Report) is included in the file. In only two of the other files is\nthere any evidence that the ID investigator considered the use of force history of the officers\ninvolved in the incident while conducting the investigation. However, the infraction history of the\ninmate involved was usually included in the file and commented on in the ID closing\nmemorandum.\n3.  In 81 of the 185 files the ID investigator made no effort to locate inmate witnesses. In thirty two of\nthose 81, the Investigation Division did not view the videotape.\n4.  In 1996 there continued to be extensive delays in completing ID investigations. These delays were\nunexplained by the contents of the ID file, and occurred even in those cases in which there was\nvideotaped evidence of staff misconduct, and the tape made it clear that staff had submitted false\nreports.\n1. Throughout 1996, there was a consistent failure by the Investigation Division to note the absence\nof hand-held video cameras in use of force incidents in OBCC that staff should have anticipated,\nand were therefore required to tape.\n1. The Department of Correction did not implement a computerized system for tracking correction\nofficer use of force in the CPSU. The system that was installed during Commissioner Abate's\ntenure included information derived only from preliminary \"24 hour\" reports, not from the\ninvestigative reports. (Deposition of Investigator Daniel Isaac, August 22 and November 29, 1994\n(\"Isaac deposition\") 84-85; Deposition of Use of Force Unit Director Andre Suite, April 21-22,\n1997 (\"Suite deposition\") 50.) Investigators were not required to use the computer system, and\nthey did not have direct access to any use of force computer systems; they had to request\npermission. (Deposition of Deputy Commissioner for Investigations Laura Rigby Barbieri,\nJanuary 24, March 4, 1997 (\"Rigby Barbieri deposition\") 227-228.) Some of the investigators\nassigned CPSU cases were unaware that any information existed in a database. (Deposition of\nInvestigator Anthony Fussa (\"Fussa deposition\") 142.)\n2.  Plaintiffs' expert Vincent Nathan, who for twenty years has served as a court-appointed special\nmaster or court monitor in a number of institutional reform cases involving jails and prisons,\nreviewed 79 ID files for the period 1988-1995, and 119 cases opened in 1996. He concluded that:\n[T]he sheer volume of vicious assaults against inmates in the CPSU is mind-numbing, and the failure of\nID investigators to conduct bonaflde,  let alone thorough, investigations of these incidents is appalling to\nme. Rather than serving as an external control on the continuing use of unnecessary and excessive force\nthroughout the CPSU, ID investigators acted as aiders and abetters to officers who perpetuated a reign of\nterror throughout the facility on a day-to-day basis. This is true because the quality of ID investigations\nassured officers and senior staff in the CPSU that they could engage in the most egregious forms of\ninmate abuse without any appreciable risk that investigators would bring staff misconduct to light.\nNathan Report at 92.\nFailure to Discipline Officers Who Misused Force in the CPSU\n32 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n1. There was a conspicuous failure during the period 1988-1997 to utilize Department of Correction\ndisciplinary measures effectively against staff who misused force in the CPSU. ID investigators\nand facility supervisors failed to recommend charges in many cases where consistent inmate\nstatements and the injuries to the inmate on whom force was used clearly suggested that the force\nwas unnecessary and/or excessive. In some cases, Trial Division attorneys elected to dismiss\ncharges that had been recommended by the ID investigators. When sanctions were imposed—most\noften by plea, and in some cases by an administrative law judge—they were almost always\ninsignificant.\n1. In the over 1300 use of force cases reported from the CPSU between March, 1988 and December,\n1996, only 76 incidents (forty of which occurred in 1996) resulted in disciplinary charges being\nlodged against 155 CPSU staff members in 194 separate complaints. (Some staff members were\nthe subject of repeated complaints.) Out of the total of 194 complaints issued, 115 have been\nresolved: 60 resulted in plea negotiations, often to reduced charges, with a penalty of a minimal\nloss of vacation/suspension time and/or a period of probation; one resulted in a negotiated plea for\ndismissal after the staff member was convicted of misdemeanor charges in state court (the\nmisdemeanor charges arose from the use of force incident); thirty three resulted in outright\ndismissal of all charges in the form of an \"administrative filing\" of the charges; six resulted in the\nminimal penalty of a command discipline; and thirteen officers went to trial at OATH. The OATH\ntrials resulted in eleven findings of no guilt, and two findings of guilt. Seventy-nine complaints\nremain open; as of June 18, all of the open cases are at least seventeen months old, four are over\nthree years old.\n2.  The level of disciplinary action directed at CPSU staff in connection with the use of force varied\nover the years, but from 1990 through 1996 it was consistently low. Between March, 1989 and\nJanuary, 1990—while Bonnie Nathan was the Assistant Commissioner for Investigations and\nDiscipline—14 complaints were filed against CPSU staff members for violations of use of force\npolicies. Commissioner Sielaff fired Nathan in July, 1990--because, he claimed, she had been\n\"unduly harsh\" in her approach to disciplining uniformed staff—and the utilization of Department\ndiscipline with respect to the CPSU declined in lock-step with Sielaff s \"hands off1 approach. No\ndisciplinary charges were filed against CPSU staff between January, 1990 and September, 1991.\nOne incident resulted in charges being filed in 1991 (a 1991 incident); four incidents resulted in\ncharges being filed in 1992 (all were 1992 incidents); seven incidents resulted in charges being\nfiled in 1993 (4 were 1992 incidents, 3 were from 1993); five incidents resulted in charges filed in\n1994 (one 1993 incident and four from 1994); two incidents resulted in charges being filed in\n1995 (one 1994 incident and one from 1995); three incidents resulted in charges being filed in\n1996 (one 1994 incident and two from 1996).\n3.  There were seventeen incidents which resulted in charges being filed in 1997 (one incident from\n1992 and 16 from 1996). There were twenty two additional 1996 incidents which resulted in\ncharges being filed in 1998. After 1996—as this case was proceeding to the date for trial— there\nwas a marked increase in filing administrative charges against CPSU staff. However, thirty three\nof the forty 1996 incidents which resulted in charges remain unresolved as of June 18, 1998.\nTwenty nine of the forty 1996 incidents which resulted in the filing of administrative charges were\nfiled after July, 1997, when the City first determined not to settle but to proceed to trial.\n4.  The charges that were filed against CPSU staff for violations of the use of force policy did not\nfollow from a professional assessment of the participants' credibility or of the medical evidence.\nThe few cases in which charges were brought rested on overwhelmingly persuasive evidence: ID\nstaff personally witnessed staff misconduct in the CPSU; the CPSU staff members' inconsistent\nreports or statements were highly probative of the misconduct and/or cover-up; medical evidence\ndemonstrated conclusively that staff had lied (e.g. a bootprint on an inmate's face matched the\nbootprint of the officer who denied kicking him); or a videotape showed clearly that staff initiated\nforce and then filed false reports.\nThe Need for a Court Order\n1. The evidence in the record of this case demonstrates not only the long-standing tolerance by\nDepartment officials of the pattern of misuse of force in the CPSU, but the extraordinary lengths\nto which Department personnel, over several administrations, went to subvert, evade, avoid and\n33 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\ncircumvent remedial measures which were proposed, and in some cases adopted, as means of\ncurbing the use of unnecessary and excessive force.\n1. The Department of Correction ignored the recommendations for improved and enhanced training\nset out in the report of its training consultant, Michael Gilbert, in 1987.\n2.  The Department of Correction failed to adopt most of the recommendations set out in the report of\nthe Committee on Use of Force (1988) chaired by Professor Gerald Lynch.\n3.  Department staff failed to utilize the information required to be gathered and reviewed pursuant to\nDirective 5003.\n4.  Department supervisors failed to ensure that accurate information concerning staff members' use\nof force was collected and entered into a retrievable database.\n5.  Department supervisors failed to interview staff members who had been involved in repeated use\nof force.\n6.  When staff members who had been involved in repeated use of force were interviewed,\nDepartment supervisors conducted superficial interviews and did not undertake any substantive\nreview of the staff members' conduct in the incidents.\n7.  Staff members who had been involved in repeated misuse of force, or suspected misuse of force,\nwere not removed from the CPSU (until 1995.) even though their identities were well-known.\n8.  The Integrity Control Officers, as well as Unit and other Department supervisors, failed to\nregularly and routinely review videotapes of use of force incidents. This failure permitted staff\nmembers who misused force and/or falsely reported events surrounding the use of force to remain\nin the CPSU until the incidents were investigated, and the tapes reviewed, in some cases many\nmonths later.\n9.  Department supervisors failed to enforce the requirement, set out in institutional orders, that a\nhand-held video camera be utilized to record anticipated uses of force, including cell extractions.\n10.  Department supervisors failed to follow up and take adequate measures in response to a number of\ncommunications calling their attention to evidence of a pattern of staff brutality in the CPSU\nincluding: letters and phone calls from the Legal Aid Society and the Board of Correction; reports\nprepared in 1990 and 1992 by the federal court's Office of Compliance Consultants; the\nmemorandum from Assistant Commissioner Toni V. Bair to Commissioner Abate; the\nmemoranda from the Unit's Integrity Control Officers from 1992 through 1995.\n11.  The Commissioner's transfer of Unit Manager Howard Robertson in response to officers'\ncomplaints that he would not \"back them\" in dealing with CPSU inmates, and after Robertson had\nsucceeded in reducing dramatically staff use of force in the Unit, communicated to Unit staff that\nthey would have a free hand in managing inmates through brute force and intimidation.\n12. Even after the Unit was relocated in 1996 because of this litigation and the evidence of egregious\nstaff misconduct in the CPSU, OBCC and CPSU managers refused to read use of force reports,\nview videotaped use of force incidents, and monitor staff involved repeatedly in use of force\nincidents. Staff members in a number of incidents struck handcuffed inmates outside the view of\nsurveillance cameras, but the Warden and Unit Manager avoided reading reports of these\nincidents.\n13.  After the Unit was relocated and investigative authority assigned to the Investigation Division, its\nstaff failed in large numbers of cases to interview staff members, view the videotapes or interview\ninmate witnesses, and continued to fail to complete investigations within a reasonable time frame.\n34 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nThe Stipulation of Settlement\n1. The Stipulation presented to the Court represents the parties' efforts to resolve the issues in this\nlitigation in a manner which addresses both the operational deficiencies which have plagued the\nCPSU since its inception, and the culture of brutality and cover up which were so evident in the\nUnit. The Stipulation is the product of arduous negotiations between the parties over a period of\nthree months; indeed, considering the prior attempts to resolve the litigation in 1996 and 1997, the\nStipulation represents the culmination of close to a year's negotiation. The agreement reflects, in\nour view, substantial success in addressing the deficiencies in defendants' policies and practices\nwhich were plead in the complaint and identified during the course of extensive discovery in this\ncase. The parties have assigned significant responsibility to the expert consultants—each of whom\nhas extensive experience in reforming correctional institutions and systems— to assist the\nDepartment in formulating written policies and procedures required under the Stipulation. The\nfollowing summarizes how the relief secured by the Stipulation addresses the systemic issues\nraised in the pleadings and established during the litigation.\nUse of Force Policy\n1. The Stipulation requires that the Department direct and train CPSU staff to respond to inmate\nmisconduct without force, or if force is necessary, to utilize control techniques that minimize\ninjuries to both inmates and staff. Force techniques that carry a high risk of injury, such as\npunches and blows, are restricted to escapes, similarly serious breaches of security, serious risk of\nphysical injury, or property damage which would immediately endanger the safety of staff,\ninmates, or others.\nUse of Force Training\n1. No officer or captain can be assigned to the CPSU unless the staff member has been trained in the\nutilization of control holds and other forms of self-defense, and has demonstrated a working\nknowledge of and thorough familiarity with these techniques. All uniformed staff assigned to the\nUnit must demonstrate annually that they have a working knowledge and familiarity with these\ntechniques. The failure to train adequately CPSU staff in less injurious techniques has been\nidentified as a cause of the pattern of excessive force.\n2.  The Stipulation requires that the Department, with the parties' expert consultants, formulate a\ntraining curriculum and written standards and procedures governing the use of force by correction\nstaff in the CPSU. The training will include control techniques, nature of minimal force, nature of\nalternatives to force, means for avoiding the unnecessary use of force, when and how gas, batons,\nshields and stun equipment may properly be used, a policy on inmate movement, a policy\nrequiring the use of the hand-held video camera, and when and how to conduct a cell extraction.\nThe Stipulation requires that staff receive no less than two weeks' training prior to their\nassignment to the Unit in the utilization of use of force techniques and procedures, including\ntechniques intended to minimize injuries to staff and inmates. As a condition of their continued\nassignment to the Unit, CPSU officers will receive an additional forty hours of training annually\non a quarterly basis, or more frequently as determined by the Department in consultation with the\nexpert consultants. The Stipulation further requires that on an annual basis CPSU staff members'\nskills will be reassessed. This requirement addresses the apparent ineffectiveness of the\nDepartment's existing training program, as shown by staffs own statements as well as their\nbehavior.\nCPSU Operating Manual: Written Policies and Procedures for CPSU Staff\n1. The Stipulation requires that the Department, with the parties' expert consultants, create a revised\nCPSU Operating Manual. The Operating Manual will include the use of force policy for the\nCPSU, a description of how medical, mental health and other mandated services are to be\nprovided to CPSU inmates, and the policy governing the use of mechanical restraints. Interaction\nbetween staff and inmates in connection with the delivery of mandated services, including\n35 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nrestraint and escort of inmates to and from the Unit, have been \"flash points\" leading to\nconfrontations and use of force. Clarifying the rules and procedures should mitigate this problem.\nMental Health Services and the Removal of Disturbed Inmates from the CPSU\n1. A significant number of injuries have been inflicted upon inmates in incidents stemming from\nbehavior that appears to reflect emotional disorder. The Stipulation requires that the Department\nmaintain a written plan for the provision of mental health services to CPSU inmates. Inmates\ndeemed by mental health staff to present a risk of mental or emotional deterioration if placed or\ncontinued to be confined in the CPSU shall be removed and placed in alternative housing.\nObservation aides are required to be assigned to each housing area; all inmates in the CPSU shall\nbe seen by medical staff daily so that referrals to mental health services may be made. The\nStipulation also requires that mental health staff shall review any punitive segregation time\nimposed on an inmate in a mental observation housing area, and prohibits the transfer of an inmate\nfrom a mental observation area to the CPSU without authorization of mental health staff. Mental\nhealth staff must also interview and review the medical records of any inmate receiving mental\nhealth services who is to be placed in the CPSU before such placement.\nProhibition of Denying Services as Punishment (\"Burning\")\n1. The Stipulation requires that uniform staff shall not withhold access to any service or program in\nthe CPSU in retaliation for misconduct or perceived misconduct, and that no CPSU inmate shall\nbe housed in a cell which lacks an operable sink with running water, a flushable toilet, and\nappropriate bedding. Uniformed staff shall supervise food delivery and shall ensure that food is\ndelivered to each inmate in a housing area.\nCPSU Time-Lapse Video Coverage\n1. The Stipulation reflects the parties' agreement that a properly implemented videotaping system\nwill help keep use of force within lawful bounds by assisting in enforcing accountability. The\nStipulation requires that the wall mounted video cameras in the CPSU will continue to be\nmaintained, and that additional cameras will be added to designated areas. ERU (now \"ESU\"\n(Emergency Services Unit)) vests will have visible identifying numbers which can be read by the\ncameras and staff will be required to record the number of the vest that they wore during an\noperation. Searches conducted of inmates transferred to the CPSU shall be conducted with a\nsupervisor present in an area subject to continuous video-taped surveillance.\nCPSU Hand Held Video Cameras\n1. The Stipulation requires that hand-held cameras be used to record anticipated uses of force,\nincluding facility and ESU searches, as well as all non-routine movement of an inmate from their\ncell to an area not covered by a wall-mounted video camera. The hand-held tape must provide\ncontinuous coverage throughout the incident and the escort of the inmate from the area.\nScreening and Selection of CPSU Staff\n1. Discovery in this case demonstrated that the CPSU's distinctive culture was in part caused by the\nfact that its staff—both line offices and supervisors—was drawn disproportionately from the ranks\nof the newly hired and newly promoted. These individuals had no on-the-job experience in\nexercising their responsibilities in other, less violent jail settings. The Stipulation sets out\nrequirements to ensure that experienced staff are assigned to the unit: half of the correction officer\nstaff assigned to the CPSU must have completed their two year probationary period; one quarter\nmust have completed one year of their probationary period; and no housing area shall be staffed\nsolely by probationary correction officers. No probationary captains or assistant deputy wardens\nshall be assigned to the CPSU. In addition, the Stipulation screens out staff whose history of use\nof force suggests a risk of misconduct in the CPSU. No staff with pending disciplinary charges\narising from a use of force incident, or who have in the prior ten years been found guilty or\n36 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\npleaded guilty or no contest in satisfaction of charges of excessive, impermissible, or unnecessary\nforce; failure to supervise in an incident that resulted in serious injury to an inmate; false reporting\nor false statements; or failure to report a use of force may be assigned to the CPSU. The\nStipulation requires that the disciplinary history, as well as the use of force history, of all staff to\nbe assigned to the unit be subject to extensive and detailed review before their approval for\nassignment.\nTransfer of Staff from the CPSU Upon Documentation of Involvement in Misuse of Force\n1. The Stipulation requires that any CPSU staff charged with excessive, impermissible, or\nunnecessary force, false reporting or false statements, failure to supervise, failure to employ an\nalternative to force, or failure to report a use of force, shall be transferred from the CPSU. The\nconduct of staff charged with other misconduct shall also be reviewed for possible transfer from\nthe Unit.\nReview of Staff Use of Force\n1. The Stipulation requires that the facility supervisory staff review and evaluate the conduct of staff\nmembers who have been involved in repeated applications of force. This review will utilize the\ninformation gathered about the staff members' conduct by the Investigations Division, and it is\nexpected that this review will be consistent with the policy underlying Directive 5003. The failure\nto carry out this policy was one of the deficiencies identified in the course of discovery.\nUse of Force Reporting: Eliminating Collusion and Requiring Prompt Preparation of Reports\n1. The lack of honest and prompt reporting of use of force incidents has been a major factor limiting\naccountability of staff for misuse of force. The Stipulation includes requirements for staff report\nwriting designed to eliminate collusion between officers, and to ensure accuracy of reporting:\nreports shall be written directly after an incident; they shall include detailed information from the\nstaff member's personal knowledge; and reports shall be written independently in separate areas\nunder supervision. Staff who cannot write a report due to injury shall give an oral statement to a\nsupervisor who was not a witness or participant in the incident.\n2.  The Stipulation requires that staff who claim injury be offered the opportunity to be examined in\nthe facility clinic. Staff refusal of treatment shall be recorded and included in the documentation of\nthe incident. A logbook in the clinic shall record the time that inmates and staff arrive in the clinic\nfor treatment. Medical examination reports shall include the time that the individual was treated\nby medical personnel. This provision is intended to eliminate the characteristic excessive delays\nbetween inmate's being removed from the scene of a use of force incident and their being seen by\na medical professional.\n3.  The Stipulation requires that an inmate involved in a use of force incident shall be escorted to the\nclinic after the incident by staff who were not involved in the incident as either a participant or as\na witness.\n4.  The Stipulation requires that the \"use of force package\" (use of force reports, use of force witness\nreports, injury to inmate reports and all other documents and physical evidence pertaining to a use\nof force) shall be compiled by a Captain who was neither a participant nor a witness to the\nincident and that the package shall be provided to the CPSU Use of Force Unit of the Investigation\nDivision within 7 days after the incident. The Stipulation also provides that the Investigation\nDivision staff may get copies of reports as soon as they are prepared.\nPhysical Evidence; Photographs\n1. The Stipulation includes requirements to collect, and safeguard physical evidence including\nphotographs, videotapes, and contraband. Photographs of staff and inmates will be taken by staff\nwho were not witnesses or participants in the incident. The Department will utilize wall-mounted\nand hand-held video cameras to record staff-inmate  confrontations.\nCPSU Use of Force Unit - Investigations\n37 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\n1. Central to the Stipulation are the requirements for investigations of use of force incidents which\noccur in the CPSU. The Department will continue to use a dedicated group of investigators and\nattorneys—assigned to the Investigation Division and outside the facility chain of command—to\ninvestigate CPSU use of force incidents. The CPSU Use of Force Unit (\"CPSU-UFU\"), a section\nof the DOC Investigation Division, shall investigate all uses of force and allegations of uses of\nforce in the CPSU, as well as allegations of staff misconduct in connection with incidents in which\nCPSU inmates are injured. The Stipulation sets forth the minimum staffing level for CPSU-UFU,\nincluding the requirement that there be an Integrity Control Officer (ICO) assigned to the facility;\nrequirements governing the supervision of CPSU-UFU; time frames for completing\ninvestigations; and requirements for how to conduct investigations. The Stipulation requires that\ninvestigators assigned to CPSU-UFU undergo a 40 hour training course that will include:\ninterviewing skills and techniques; basic medical terminology; evaluating evidence; writing\nanalytic reports; operating procedures in the CPSU; history of the poor investigations previously\nconducted in the CPSU; video reviewing; handling physical evidence; use of computer database;\nand other CPSU-UFU procedures. The Stipulation requires that UFU investigators receive a\nminimum of 40 hours of investigatory training each year.\n2.  The Stipulation requires that the CPSU-UFU be notified after each use of force that occurs in the\nCPSU.\n3.  The requirements in the Stipulation for conducting investigations include: preliminary review of\nevidence and videotapes; careful review of all videotapes; obtaining and reviewing reports from\nmedical facilities; use of medical experts to assist in interpreting the cause of injuries;\nidentification of inmate and staff participants and witnesses; interviews with inmate participants\nand witnesses; staff interviews; review of inmate and staff prior involvement in uses of force; and\nstaff members' prior disciplinary history.\nCPSU Integrity Control Officer - ICO\n1. The Stipulation sets out specific duties and responsibilities for the Integrity Control Officer\nassigned exclusively to the CPSU, who will operate as the \"eyes and ears\" of the Investigation\nDivision in the Unit itself. These responsibilities include: report writing; conducting unscheduled\ntours of the Unit; maintaining the integrity of the video recording system and evidence room;\nreviewing all videotapes of use of force incidents; responding to alarms, anticipated uses of force\nand ESU operations to observe activities; and assisting CPSU-UFU investigators.\nCase Tracking System: The Requirement of Computerized Record Keeping\n1. A critical provision of the Stipulation requires that the Department of Correction's Investigation\nand Trials Division utilize computerized databases with searching and reporting capabilities, a\nresource that has never been consistently available to the Department of Correction in the past.\nThe databases will include every use of force incident which occurs in the CPSU and every\ndisciplinary action against CPSU staff. Information in the databases will be used for the\nsupervision of UFU (maintaining compliance with time frames for completing investigations,\ntracking caseloads, reviewing investigative efforts), for the purpose of retrieving information\nuseful in investigations (officers' repeated use of gas or other force, groups of officers repeatedly\ninvolved in uses of force together), and for the resolution of disciplinary charges against staff\n(formulating plea offers and making recommendations for penalty at OATH). The Stipulation\ndesignates data that must be in the program including: injuries to inmate, injuries to staff, type of\nforce used, location of incident, was a weapon recovered, was a weapon alleged and not\nrecovered, names of staff and inmates involved, UFU investigator, date of incident, date of\ninvestigation closing, result of investigation, and use of force number.\nDisciplinary Charges\n1. The Stipulation sets out time frames for the service and resolution of disciplinary charges against\nCPSU staff intended to minimize the lengthy delays which have historically plagued the process.\nThe Stipulation requires that the Department and the joint expert consultants formulate penalty\n38 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration  http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nguidelines so that, in a break from the past, staff will be appropriately disciplined for specific\nviolations of the Department's use of force and reporting requirements. The Stipulation requires\nthat the penalty guideline will be used by the Trials and Litigation Division in formulating plea\nagreements and in making recommendations to the Administrative Law Judges.\nThe Parties' Expert Consultants\n1. To assist in the implementation of the remedial plan set out in the Stipulation, the parties have\njointly retained two nationally recognized corrections experts for a period of two years, or longer\nif the parties agree. Norman Carlson is the retired Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons,\nand Steve J. Martin, who was one of plaintiffs' experts in this litigation, has served as a consultant\nand expert witness in connection with investigations and litigation with respect to scores of\ncorrectional facilities. Mr. Martin throughout his career has focused on use of force issues and the\nimplementation of remedial plans to curb unnecessary and excessive force in correction\ninstitutions.\n2.  The Stipulation requires that, shortly after the Court approves the agreement as an order, the\nconsultants will assist the Department in formulating: written standards and procedures governing\nthe use of force in the CPSU; a training curriculum for CPSU staff and a plan for continued,\nin-service training; and a revised CPSU Operating Manual. Thereafter, the consultants will\nconduct site visits, document reviews, interviews with Department staff and CPSU inmates to\nassess the Department's compliance with the Stipulation.\n3.  The scope of the consultants' responsibilities include periodic reviews of all activity addressed by\nthe remedy: use of force incidents in the CPSU, the investigation of those incidents by the\nInvestigation Division, and the discipline of staff members against whom charges have been\nrecommended; and the formulation and implementation of policies and procedure which are, or\nshould be, operative in the CPSU. In addition, the consultants will \"assess the adequacy of\ndefendants' use of force policy, staffing and supervision practices, training programs, and any\nother practices addressed by [the] Stipulation and Order which are intended to insure that the\nplaintiff class is reasonably safeguarded from injury.\" See, Stipulation ¶ 91. The consultants will\nsubmit written reports to the Court and parties every 90 days for the first year, and thereafter every\n120 days, assessing defendants' compliance with the Stipulation and Order and reporting to them\n\"any other matters which affect the security and safety of the plaintiff class.\" See, Stipulation ¶ 92.\n4.  The City will provide the expert consultants, as well as plaintiffs' counsel, with relevant records\nand documents on an agreed-upon schedule, either bi-weekly or monthly.\nMonitoring, Enforcement, Continuing Jurisdiction\n1. Pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), the Stipulation will remain in effect for\ntwo years after which the defendants may move to terminate. The PLRA requires a district court\nto terminate a decree unless the Court makes written findings that the relief \"remains necessary to\ncorrect a current and ongoing violation\" of the federal right, extends no further than necessary to\ncorrect such a violation, and is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct such\nviolation.\" The Stipulation adopts this language in ¶ 103.\n2.  The parties have agreed that in any contested proceeding arising under the Stipulation, stipulated\nfacts may be submitted to the court \"summarizing the record in this action.\" Thus, in the event\nplaintiffs' move to enforce the Stipulation or seek further relief, or contest the defendants' motion\nto terminate under ¶ 103, they can submit to the court the stipulated facts referred to in ¶ 102.\nConclusion\n1. We believe that the foregoing summary demonstrates that the Stipulation of Settlement negotiated\nby the parties reflects the successful achievement by the plaintiff class of\nthe goals of the litigation, and will—if complied with—adequately protect the constitutional rights of the\nmembers of the plaintiff class. We therefore request that the Court approve the Stipulation and order the\n39 of 40  4/5/99 1:10 PM\n\nRule 23 (e) Declaration http://www.legal-aid.org/rule23.htm\nrelief set out in the Stipulation.\nJONATHAN S.
