    "summary": "<p>In 1984, female inmates at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the New York State Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The inmates, represented by attorneys from the New York Legal Aid Society's Prisoners' Rights Project, alleged that their constitutional rights had been violated by poor dental care at the prison, and they asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief.  </p><p>On August 29, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Shirley Wohl Kram) certified the plaintiffs as a class, holding that declaratory and injunctive relief was appropriate to the class as a whole. Dean v. Coughlin, 107 F.R.D. 331 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 1985).</p><p>On December 3, 1985, district court (Judge Kram) granted a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs, ordering the defendants to provide adequate dental care to inmates with serious dental needs.  Specifically, the court ordered the defendants to provide a dental access system assuring prompt diagnosis and treatment for inmates with serious dental needs, timely follow-up care, and elimination of backlogs in treatment.  Refusing to be more specific regarding the terms of the injunction, the court stated its expectation that the defendants and plaintiffs would work out terms for compliance with this injunction.  Dean v. Coughlin, 623 F.Supp. 392 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).</p><p>On April 1, 1986, the district court (Judge Kram) issued a more detailed order implementing the preliminary injunction, noting that the defendants had failed to even attempt to improve dental services at Bedford Hills.  The court required that a priority system must be set for dental care and that all inmates be given an opportunity to have a dental examination to determine their treatment priorities.  The court further laid out requirements for a dental sick-call system, an appointment and follow-up system, treatment deadlines for non-emergency patients, dental emergency procedures, dental record keeping, and reporting.  Dean v. Coughlin, 633 F.Supp. 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1986).  The defendants appealed.</p><p>On October 28, 1986, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Judge Walter Roe Mansfield, Judge Amalya Lyle Kearse, and Judge Ralph K. Winter, Jr.) vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case, holding that the district court had abused its discretion by specifying in detail the system of dental care to be provided.  The circuit court reasoned that the district court should have instead used the New York State Department of Corrections' plan as a guide, subject to minor modifications.  Dean v. Coughlin, 804 F.2d 207 (2nd Cir. 1986).</p><p>On February 26, 1987, the parties entered into a settlement, which the district court (Judge Kram) approved as a consent decree on June 17, 1987.  The consent decree provided for dental care regulations in the areas of treatment priorities, dental emergencies, dental sick call, follow-up care, staffing, record-keeping, and compliance supervision.</p><p>In 1988, the defendants informed the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs' expert, a dentist named Dr. William Byland, was illegally practicing dentistry because he was not licensed to practice in New York.  The plaintiffs asked the district court for a protective order to enjoin the defendants from prosecuting Byland on criminal charges, arguing that the defendants had attempted to intimidate him by threatening criminal prosecution.  On July 12, 1989, the district court (Judge Kram) denied the plaintiffs' motion, holding that there was insufficient evidence to find that the defendants had attempted to intimidate or prosecute Byland.  Dean v. Coughlin, 1989 WL 82421 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 1989).  We have no further information on the proceedings in this case.</p><p></p>",

COUGHLIN III, et al., Defendants.\nNo. 84 Civ. 1528 (SWK).\nUnited States District Court, S.D. New York.\nApril 1, 1986.\nThe Legal Aid Soc., Prisoners' Rights Project, New York City by William J. Rold and Paul T. Belazis, for plaintiffs.\nRobert Abrams, Atty. Gen., State of N.Y. by Frederic L. Lieberman and Douglas D. Aronin, New York City, for\ndefendants Coughlin, Broaddus, Pollard, Headley and Harris.\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nKRAM, District Judge.\nOn December 3, 1985, this Court issued an opinion in this case which found a total breakdown in the provision of\n[1]\ndental care at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, 623 F.Supp. 392, (Bedford Hills).  The Court also found\nthat inmates with serious dental problems at Bedford Hills were in immediate danger of irreparable harm to their\n[2]\nhealth.  The Court entered a preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants to provide adequate dental care to\n[3]\ninmates with serious dental needs at Bedford Hills.  Specifically, the Court ordered the defendants to \"provide a\ndental access system that assures prompt diagnosis and treatment for inmates with serious dental needs,\nprovide a system that assures that follow-up care is provided as ordered and without delay, and take prompt\n[4]\nsteps to eliminate expeditiously the current backlogs in treatment.\"  In the opinion, the Court indicated it would\nrefrain from entering a more detailed order because it expected the parties to cooperate in implementing the\npreliminary injunction.\nIn order to assess compliance with the preliminary injunction, the Court held a conference with the parties on\n309 December 20, 1985. The Court adduced that the defendants *309 had made no progress in improving dental\ncare at Bedford Hills and had rebuffed all plaintiffs' overtures to discuss compliance terms. In short, the\ndefendants were not complying with the preliminary injunction. The Court ordered the defendants to meet with\nthe plaintiffs within ten days to discuss compliance.\nThe Court held another conference on January 17, 1986. Although the parties reported to the Court that they had\nmet on December 30, 1985, they also stated they made little progress at the meeting. Defense counsel informed\nthe Court that defendants were planning to hire Mobile Dental Services (MDS) to provide dental care at Bedford\nHills. When the Court asked about the status of the negotiations, defense counsel informed the Court that the\nnegotiations were proceeding slowly, and that defendant Broaddus, who was responsible for the negotiations,\nwas very busy with prisoners suffering from AIDS. Neverthless, the defendants were unwilling to allow another\nstate official to conduct the negotiations. Defense counsel also complained that defendants' obligation to produce\ndiscovery in the underlying action reduced the time they could spend on working out compliance terms. It\nbecame clear to the Court that defendants were engaging in dilatory tactics.\nDefendants' attitude about this litigation has also been problematic. They apparently fail to recognize that based\non overwhelming evidence that they were not providing dental treatment to inmates with serious dental needs,\nthe Court has entered a preliminary injunction ordering them to institute an appropriate dental care system.\nInstead, defendants have refused to enter into settlement negotiations as the court has urged. They have fiercely\nresisted plaintiffs' legitimate discovery requests, requiring intervention by the Court on a number of occasions.\nFor example on December 20, the Court had to order the defendants to produce current dental records. The\n\nCourt had already ordered the records produced in November. Defendants also sought a protective order against\nplaintiffs' taking of certain depositions, including that of defendant Thomas Coughlin, which the Court also denied.\nEven more disturbing to the Court has been the defendants' failure even to attempt to improve dental services at\nBedford Hills as ordered. Plaintiffs' counsel indicated that he was receiving ten to fifteen letters a week from\ninmates who were in pain and not receiving dental treatment. Plaintiffs' expert also inspected the dental facility,\nand after reviewing the clinic's statistics found that two out of five emergency patients were not receiving\ntreatment. Defense counsel could not rebut these claims with any specific assertions, and simply stated the\ninformation he had was the clinic was treating emergencies. The Court's impression was that the clinic was\ntreating only emergencies.\nBased on the above, the Court ordered each party to submit a proposed order for implementation of the\npreliminary injunction. The Court also ordered each party to submit to the Court a proposed notice to the inmates\nat Bedford Hills updating the status of this class action.\nEach party has submitted detailed proposals for compliance as well as replies and surreplies. The defendants\npropose to hire MDS to provide dental care at Bedford Hills. By their own estimate, their plan would take from\nthree to seven weeks to implement once the Court approved it. Given the defendants' history of promises to\n[5]\nimprove dental services without ultimate delivery  and obstinacy in complying with the preliminary injunction,\nthe Court is skeptical about these estimates. Even if these estimates were accurate, however, they are not\nsatisfactory. The Court's opinion of December 3 found that a number of inmates were in immediate danger of\n[6]\nirreparable harm.  The defendants have made no apparent effort to employ existing resources to improve\n310 delivery of dental services, *310 and the Court will not approve a plan that will take additional time.\nAlthough MDS might well be able to provide adequate dental services at Bedford Hills in the long run, the\ndefendants must act now to comply with the preliminary injunction. While the Court encourages the defendants to\ncontinue their negotiations with MDS, and does not intend this Order to preclude the defendants from hiring MDS\nto run the clinic, the Court's major concern is providing immediate dental care to inmates with serious dental\nneeds at Bedford Hills. With that in mind, the Court will order defendants to comply with a plan which will insure\nsuch treatment.\nIt is hereby ORDERED that the defendants comply with the following plan for implementing the preliminary\ninjunction.\nI. Establishment of a Priority System\nA. No later than ten days after the entry of this Order, Bedford Hills shall adopt the American Dental Association's\nsystem for classifying dental cases as its guideline for setting treatment priorities. (A copy of the criteria is\nattached as Appendix A.) The classification system denominates four classes of patients. Class One patients\nshall be called non-priority patients, Class Two patients shall be called low priority patients, Class Three patients\nshall be called high priority patients, and, Class Four patients shall be called emergency patients.\nB. A copy of the priority system shall be posted in the dental clinic, each housing unit, and the law library.\nC. Within 10 days of this Order, the defendants shall file an affidavit with the Court stating the date the priority\nsystem was adopted and the date it was posted.\nII. Assessment Examinations of the Inmate Population\nA. No later than ten days after entry of the Order, defendants shall notify the inmate population that they may\nrequest an assessment examination by a dentist for the purpose of assigning treatment priorities to their current\ndental needs. The notification shall be made in a manner reasonably calculated to insure that all inmates\nwherever confined at Bedford Hills have an opportunity to request this examination. At a minimum, defendants\nshall post in each housing unit at Bedford Hills a sheet entitled \"Requests for Dental Assessment Examination.\"\n\nThe sheet shall explain that inmates may obtain an assessment examination by signing their names. These\nsheets shall be posted for thirty days following the date of this Order.\nB. The defendants shall account for each inmate by noting her choice to request or decline the assessment\nexamination on a log bearing the names of the entire inmate population.\nC. No later than forty-five days after entry of this Order, defendants shall insure that a dentist completes an\nassessment examination of all patients who request one. Such patients shall be informed of the dentist's findings\nand of their treatment priorities. Defendants shall maintain a log of all patients who had assessment\nexaminations, containing the patient's name and number, the date she was examined, and the treatment priority\nshe was assigned. Defendants shall also enter this information on each inmate's dental chart.\nD. During the period in which the assessment examinations are conducted, the dental clinic shall continue to treat\nClass 4 emergency patients.\nE. No later than 10 days after this Order, the defendants shall file with the Court an affidavit stating that they have\nnotified the inmate population that they may request assessment examinations and describing the method of\nnotification. Within forty-five days after the entry of this Order, defendants shall file with the Court a copy of each\nlog required to be maintained by this section along with an affidavit stating that the logs are accurate and the\n[7]\nassessment examinations have been completed.\n311  III. Dental Sick-Call System\n*311\nA. No later than forty-five days after entry of this Order, defendants shall adopt the following system for dental\nsick-call.\nB. The dental sick-call system shall utilize sign-up sheets, to be posted daily in all housing areas and\nconspicuously marked \"Requests for Dental Care.\" Inmates desiring a consultation with the dentist shall sign the\nsheet and indicate the reason for the request; or where it is not feasible for the inmate to sign the sheet herself,\ndefendants shall insure that facility personnel note the request at her behest. Defendants shall insure that the\nsign-up sheets are collected and delivered to the dental clinic by 9:00 a.m. on a daily basis.\nC. The dental sick-call system to be initiated shall replace the \"Request for Dental Appointment\" forms and\n\"Nurses Screening Lists\" insofar as dental care is concerned.\nD. Patients whose requests for dental care indicate they need emergency treatment shall be seen and treated by\na dentist on the day of their request. Patients seeking emergency care who after examination are not found to be\nsuffering from dental emergencies shall be treated in accord with the next paragraph.\nE. All other patients requesting dental sick call shall be examined by a dentist within one week after their\nrequests. Defendants shall assign treatment priorities to all such patients and shall inform them of the dentist's\nfindings and of their priorities.\nF. Defendants shall maintain a daily log of all patients examined at dental sick call containing the patient's name\nand number, the date she requested treatment, the date she was examined, and her treatment priority.\nDefendants shall file an affidavit within forty-five days of this Order stating they have adopted this system for\ndental sick call.\nIV. Appointment and Follow-Up System\nA. If the examining dentist believes a patient who has received an examination requires a return visit to the dental\nclinic for follow-up treatment or evaluation, the dentist shall exercise his or her best professional judgment as to\nwhen the patient should be seen again and shall enter such order on the patient's dental chart. Such patients\nshall be given follow-up appointments in accordance with the dentist's order.\n\nB. The follow-up and appointment system shall utilize an appointment book, a \"prosthetic device log\" and a\n\"missed appointment log.\"\nC. Defendants shall make all dental appointments for a specific date and time and enter them in an appointment\nbook. At the time her appointment is made, each patient shall be given a signed appointment slip bearing the\ndate and time of her appointment. These appointments shall be made before the patient leaves the dental clinic\non the day she is examined or treated, unless such patients are awaiting prosthetic services involving an outside\nlaboratory.\nD. Defendants shall maintain a \"prosthetic device log\" for all dental patients awaiting prosthetic services involving\nan outside laboratory. The log shall contain the patient's name and number, the prosthetic service she is awaiting,\n312 each date the prosthetic device or impression is sent to or *312 returned from the laboratory, and the date the\nfinished device is delivered to the patient. A follow-up appointment shall be made for each such patient when her\nprosthetic device is returned from the laboratory for fitting, and the appointment shall occur within one week of\nthe receipt of the device by the dental clinic.\nE. At the end of each working day, defendants shall enter in a \"missed appointment log\" the name and number of\neach patient who had a dental appointment scheduled for that day but was not treated, along with the purpose of\nthe appointment and the reason for its non-occurrence. No patient shall be deemed to have refused treatment\nunless she, or a facility staff member witnessing her refusal, so states in writing.\nF. Unless she has informed the dental clinic in writing that she wishes to discontinue treatment, a patient whose\nappointment does not occur on the day it was scheduled shall be given a new appointment, which shall be\nentered in the appointment book and in the \"missed appointment log\"; and a new appointment slip shall be\npromptly sent to the patient. New appointments shall be made in accord with the clinic's classification guidelines.\nV. Treatment Deadlines for Non-Emergency Patients\nA. Patients identified as Class 3 patients at dental examinations pursuant to dental sick-call or at an assessment\nexamination shall be given appointments for commencement of their treatment. During the first three months\nafter completion of the assessment examinations, treatment shall commence for all Class 3 patients within thirty\ndays after such identification. For Class 3 patients identified more than three months after completion of the\nassessment examination, treatment shall commence within fourteen days after such identification.\nB. All other non-emergency patients identified as needing treatment at dental sick-call or at an assessment\nexamination shall be placed on waiting lists, containing the patient's name and number, the specific treatment\nshe is awaiting and the priority assigned to it, and the date she is placed on the list. During the first three months\nafter completion of the assessment examinations, treatment shall commence for patients on waiting lists within\nninety days after such identification. For patients placed on waiting lists more than three months after entry of this\nOrder, treatment shall commence within sixty days after the day they are placed on the list. When the clinic sets a\ndefinite appointment for a patient on a waiting list, the patient shall be informed of the appointment as indicated in\nsection IV of this Order.\nVI. Dental Emergencies.\nA. Upon entry of this Order, defendants shall provide all Bedford Hills inmates immediate access to health care\nstaff in the event of dental emergencies and shall insure that all patient requests for emergency dental assistance\nare promptly transmitted by telephone to the dental clinic or, during times when the clinic is not operating, to\nhealth care staff.\nB. Defendants shall insure that each patient requesting emergency dental assistance is examined on the day of\nher request. If a dentist is present at the facility when the request for emergency dental assistance is made, the\nexamination shall be performed by a dentist. If a dentist is not present at the facility when the request for\nemergency dental assistance is made, the examination shall be performed by a physician or a registered nurse,\n\nwho shall have twenty-four hour access to a dentist for consultation; and the patient shall be re-examined by a\ndentist on the next working day.\nC. Defendants shall maintain a log of all patients examined as dental emergencies, containing the patient's name\nand number, the date she was examined, and a notation that she was either treated or referred to dental sick call.\nVII. Equipment, Staff, and Operating Hours\n313 A. The defendants shall maintain adequate facilities to fulfill the terms of this *313 Order. At a minimum,\ndefendants shall provide the clinic with four fully equipped dental operatories, one intra-oral X-ray unit, one pan\noral X-ray unit, and one dental X-ray developer.\nB. The defendants shall maintain personnel at the clinic as necessary to fulfill the terms of this Order. At a\nminimum, the staff shall consist of two full-time dentists, one full-time dental hygienist, one full-time dental\nassistant, and one full-time dental records clerk.\nC. The dental clinic shall be open on a daily basis for as long as necessary to comply with this Order, but in no\nevent for less than eight hours a day, five days a week.\nVIII. Dental Records\nA. Defendants shall maintain an individual dental record for each dental patient. The record shall contain, but is\nnot limited to:\n1. A chart of the patient's teeth;\n2. An accurate medical history;\n3. An assessment of the patient's periodontal condition;\n4. All dental x-rays of the patient, to be mounted or otherwise affixed to the record to reduce the\nchance for loss;\n5.

In addition, defendants shall provide all present and new\ninmates with a written and verbal orientation to the dental services available at Bedford Hills, the procedure for\nrequesting such services, and the method by which complaints regarding services can be lodged. This\ninformation shall be available to non-English-speaking inmates in a language they can understand.\nD. Defendants shall maintain such records as are necessary to effective and meaningful auditing of their\ncompliance with this Order. At a minimum, these shall include:\n1. All dental records, logs, lists, appointment books, sign-up sheets and other documents required\nto be maintained by this Order:\n314 *314 2.

Defendants shall notify the inmate population of the name of this person\nthrough posting notices in the dental clinic, the law library, and next to the sheets for requesting dental care.\nDefendants shall file an affidavit with the Court within ten days informing it of the name of the person who will\nfulfill this role.\nH. The terms of this Order do not preclude the defendants from making other, more extensive reforms in the\nBedford Hills clinic, including the institution of regular initial screening examinations, prophylactic treatment, and\ncheck-up exams.\nX. Security.\nPlaintiffs are excused from giving security for the entry of this preliminary injunction.\nXI. Reports.\nFollowing the completion of the assessment examinations, the defendants are to file a report with the Court every\nthirty days describing their compliance with this Order. At a minimum, the report is to contain: 1) a list of each\npatient who requested emergency treatment, stating the date she requested treatment, the date she received\ntreatment, her diagnosis, and the treatment she received; 2) a list of each patient who requested an examination\nthrough the dental sick call system, the date she requested the exam, the date she was examined, her diagnosis,\nand the treatment priority received; 3) a list of all follow-up appointments ordered, whether they were kept, if not\nkept the reason, and whether another appointment was made; 4) a list of each patient who did not attend an\n\nexamination scheduled after she requested treatment on the dental sick call list, the reason she did not attend,\nand the date of the next scheduled appointment; 5) a list of each patient requiring prosthetic services, the\nprosthetic service she needs, the date the prosthetic impression is sent to or returned from the lab, and the date\nthe service is completed; 6) a list of each patient awaiting Class 2 treatment, including her diagnosis, the services\nshe is awaiting, and the duration of her wait; 7) a list of each patient not treated within the time limits described in\nthis Order, including an explanation for the failure; 8) a list of each patient classified as a priority 3 case, the date\nshe was so classified, the date she received treatment, and the treatment she received; and 9) copies of all\n315 complaints *315 defendants receive from inmates not satisfied with their dental treatment.\nSO ORDERED.\nAPPENDIX A\nPATIENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\nThe following classification system shall be used in planning treatment schedules. The system was prepared by\nthe American Dental Association.\nCLASS 1\nIndividuals apparently requiring no dental treatment related to the type of examination or inspection performed.\nCLASS 2\nIndividuals requiring treatment for conditions not of an urgent nature, such as:\na. moderate calculus\nb. prosthetic cases not included in Class 3\nc. caries 00 not extensive or advanced periodontal diseases 00 not extensive or advanced\n97 97\nd. other oral conditions requiring corrective preventive measures\nCLASS 3\nIndividuals requiring early treatment of such conditions as:\na. extensive or advanced caries\nb. extensive or advanced periodontal disease\nc. chronic pulpal or apical infection\nd. chronic oral infection\ne. heavy calculus\nf. surgical procedures required for removal of one or more teeth and other surgical procedures not\nincluded in Class 4\ng. insufficient number of teeth for mastication\n\nCLASS 4\nIndividuals requiring emergency dental treatment for such conditions as:\na. injuries\nb. acute oral infections (parietal and periapical abcesses, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, acute\ngingivitis, acute stomatitits, etc.)\nc. painful conditions\nd. any oral condition which can jeopardize the health or safety of a patient\nSCHEDULING OF CONTINUING CARE:\nIn scheduling patients for continuing dental care, the following listing of priorities of treatment will be used:\na. relief of pain and treatment of acute infection (Class 4 patients)\nb. elimination of pathosis and extraction of teeth (Class 3 patients)\nc. removal of irritating conditions which may lead to malignancies (Class 3 or Class 2 patients)\nd. treatment of bone and soft tissue diseases (Class 3 or Class 2 patients)\ne. repair of injured or carious teeth (Class 3 or Class 2 patients)\nf. replacement of lost teeth and restoration of function (Class 2 patients)\nAPPENDIX B\nNOTICE TO CLASS\nOn March 2, 1984, a federal class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of all inmates who are or will be confined at\nBedford Hills Correctional Facility (\"Bedford Hills\"), claiming that the prison failed to provide them with\nconstitutionally adequate dental care and seeking a court order to improve the dental care system. The case was\ncertified a class action on August 29, 1985.\nInmates become members of the certified class when they arrive at Bedford Hills and remain class members until\nthey are released or transferred. During this time they are represented by attorneys of The Legal Aid Society's\nPrisoners' Rights Project, who may be contacted at:\nPrisoners' Rights Project 15 Park Row 00 7th Floor New York, New York 10038.\n97\nOn December 3, 1985, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a\n316 preliminary injunction. *316 The Court found a \"total breakdown in the administration of the dental clinic,\" noting\nin part that \"inmates at Bedford Hills are suffering from pain, loss of teeth, discomfort, weight loss, and infection\"\nas a result. The prison was ordered to \"provide adequate dental care to inmates with serious dental needs.\"\nOn April 1, 1986, the Court issued a more detailed Order and a copy will be distributed with the initial distribution\nof this Notice and will be available thereafter in the law library. The Order requires that priorities be set for dental\ncare so that the patients with the most serious problems are treated first. All inmates will have an opportunity to\nhave a dental examination to determine their own treatment priorities. When these examinations are finished, a\ndental sick call system will be established, and any inmate wishing to see a dentist will be called to the dental\nclinic within one week of her request. Any inmate with a dental emergency will be seen by someone on the prison\n\nhealth staff on the day the emergency occurs. Inmates will be given written follow-up appointments, and specific\nsteps will be taken to assure that follow-up appointments occur as ordered. A plan to reduce the backlogs of\npatients awaiting treatment will be put in place and additional staff will be hired if needed.\nThe Order entered by the Court is preliminary and there will be further proceedings in the case. The final\noutcome of this case will determine the rights of all inmates at Bedford Hills with respect to the delivery of dental\ncare.\nThe District Court's Order does not determine whether any individual inmate is entitled to money damages as a\nresult of the prison's failure to provide adequate dental care. Therefore, anyone who believes she is personally\nentitled to money damages must file an independent action. All inmates should promptly seek legal advice if they\nwish to file a claim. There are filing deadlines (called statutes of limitations) that may bar claims for inmates who\nwait too long.\nThe lawyers representing the inmates in this case are not providing class representation on the issue of money\ndamages. They can, however, try to answer questions and also provide information about how to file a claim.\nThese lawyers can also be contacted about current dental care needs that are not being addressed.\nAny person confined at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility may apply to the Court to intervene in this action either\non her own (pro se) or by an attorney of her own choice. An inmate who seeks to intervene in the action may\nchallenge any aspect of the Court's orders in this case, including the certification of the class, the adequacy of\nthe class representation, and the terms of the preliminary injunction. Parties wishing to intervene should contact\nthe Judge in the case, Hon. Shirley Wohl Kram, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, Foley\nSquare, New York, New York 10007. If a person does not intervene, her interests will be represented by the\npresent plaintiffs and their attorneys.\nThis notice must remain posted until this action has ended or until superseded by another notice.\n[1]Dean v. Coughlin, 623 F.Supp, 392, 396 (S.D.N. Y.1985)\n[2]Id. at 405.\n[3]Id.\n[4]Id.\n[5]Id. at 399-400.\n[6]Id. at 405.\n[7] The Court notes that in its opinion of December 3, 1985, it ruled that the Eighth Amendment did not require\nBedford Hills to conduct initial screening exams of inmates. Dean v. Coughlin, 623 F.Supp. 392, 404\n(S.D.N.Y.1985). The assessment examinations the Court now orders are not to be confused with the screening\nexams. The assessments are one-time examinations, to be performed on all inmates who request them. The\nCourt's authority to order the assessment exams stems directly from the Court's finding of \"a total breakdown in\nthe administration of the dental clinic at Bedford Hills....\" id. which results in the clinic's ignorance of the general\ndental needs of the inmate population, and failure to treat inmates in accord with those needs. This, in turn, leads\nto the unconstitutional delays in the provisions of dental services described id. at 397-99. The assessment\nexaminations will alow the clinic to set treatment priorities for the entire inmate population and eliminate the\nbacklogs. The Court also notes that defendants have volunteered in their proposed order to perform the\nassessment examinations.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

In this civil rights action by prisoners under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 defendants, the\nCommissioner and Assistant Commissioner of the New York State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS)\nand the Superintendent and Health Administrator of BH, appeal from a mandatory preliminary injunction issued\nby the Southern District of New York, Shirley W. Kram, J., specifying in detail the system of dental care that is to\nbe provided to BH inmates. Appellants' principal contention is that the district court abused its discretion by\nimposing upon the State the court's own plan for such care without finding that appellants' plan was\nconstitutionally inadequate and by ordering appellants to take steps in providing dental care that were not\nconstitutionally required. We vacate the injunction and remand the case for adoption of the plan proposed by the\ndefendant, subject to such further modifications as may be made by the court after a hearing.\nBH is a New York State correctional facility for women, which houses approximately 560 inmates. It serves as a\nmaximum security prison, correctional facility and reception center. On March 2, 1984, several prisoners\ncommenced this class action under § 1983, alleging that the existing system used by the defendants to provide\ndental care at BH was inadequate and violated their rights under the Eighth Amendment. They sought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment and permanent mandatory injunctive relief. More than a year later, in May 1985, the district\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief, which it granted in a decision rendered\non December 3, 1985. Dean v. Coughlin, 623 F.Supp. 392 (S.D.N.Y.1985).\nJudge Kram found a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs would succeed in showing a pattern of deliberate\nindifference by the defendants to BH inmates' serious dental needs and that as a consequence the inmates were\nsuffering and would suffer pain, loss of teeth, discomfort, anxiety, infection and life-threatening complications in\nviolation of their constitutional rights. More specifically, the court found that some patients, despite their requests,\nnever receive an initial or any other dental screening examination by a prison dentist, that the BH system for\nproviding routine dental care at BH had become \"defunct,\" and that BH had no reasonable method of\nsystematically scheduling and handling dental examinations, fillings, cleanings, extractions, dentures, root canal\nneeds and gum treatments. The BH procedure for requesting and handling emergency dental care had also\nbroken down, with backlogs and delays of many months after requests were made before the requesting inmates\nwere treated. Similarly, the BH dental clinic, despite directions by its dentists for follow-up visits by patients, failed\nto keep these appointments, leading to pain and suffering by the inmate-patients. Prophylactic care was not\nregularly provided to inmates. There were likewise failures or long delays in furnishing restorative care, e.g., filling\nof cavities, which prolonged the patients' pain and suffering.\nOn December 3, 1985, the district court, concluding that the prerequisites for preliminary relief had been met,\nordered the defendants\n\"to provide a dental access system that assures prompt diagnosis and treatment for inmates with\nserious dental needs, provide a system that assures that follow-up care is provided as ordered\nand without delay, and take prompt steps to eliminate expeditiously the current backlogs in\ntreatment. Defendants are furthermore ORDERED to take all steps necessary to comply with the\nterms of this order.\n\"The Court will not now be more specific regarding the terms of the injunction. It expects the\ndefendant and plaintiffs to work out terms for compliance with the injunction in the first instance.\" \nDean v. Coughlin, 623 F.Supp. at 405.\n209 *209 The defendants did not appeal the court's preliminary injunction.[1] On December 20, 1985, after the\nplaintiffs complained to the court that the defendants were not cooperating in furnishing discovery, and\ndefendants' counsel informed the court of the efforts being made to work out a method of implementing the\ncourt's order, Judge Kram directed the parties to meet together and work out a plan for compliance with her\norder. Although the parties did thereafter confer with respect to a remedy on December 30, 1985, no progress\nwas made except that the defendants advised that the State was negotiating with Mobile Health Services, a\nprivate contractor, to provide dental care and facilities that would satisfy constitutional requirements. On January\n17, 1986, defense counsel advised Judge Kram at a status meeting of the State's negotiations with Mobile Health\nServices. Judge Kram, expressing the view that the State was dragging its feet, directed both sides to submit\nproposed orders by January 31, 1986. On January 31, 1986, the defendants served their proposed order\nincorporating by reference a \"Plan for Implementation of the Preliminary Injunction\", which was attached, upon\nthe plaintiffs and on February 3, 1986, filed the order and Plan with the court. At approximately the same time\nplaintiffs served and filed their proposed order for implementation of the injunction.\nThe defendants' Plan consisted of a proposed contract between the State and \"Mobile Dental Services, P.C.\"\n(MDS), a private provider of professional dental care to numerous institutions. The MDS contract incorporated a\ndetailed \"Plan of Care\" for Bedford Hills designed to reduce the existing backlog and provide for continuous\ndental care thereafter for the BH inmates, including increased professional staff and operations, specific\nprocedures to determine the dental needs of the BH population, methods for establishing treatment priorities,\ndental screening of prisoners simultaneously with the provision of callout, routine and emergency care, an\nassessment examination of each inmate, a sick call system, a follow-up appointment system, the utilization of an\nenlarged dental clinic which would have operatories and additional personnel, and the maintenance of a detailed\nindividual dental record for each inmate. The defendants' Plan further provided that MDS would provide a \"Policy\nand Procedures Manual\" for BH and included copies of similar documents prepared by MDS for other\n\norganizations. The Plan also contained a proposed timetable for MDS' commencement of operations at BH,\nsamples of computer records used by MDS and the background of MDS and its chief officers.\nIn short, the defendants' Plan appears to have been an effort to set forth a remedy for the deficiencies in dental\ncare found by the court to exist in BH, which would be implemented by an established, independent organization\nspecializing in the provision of such care to institutions. The defendants' counsel advised the court that the\nproposed contract between the State and MDS would be signed upon the court's approval of the Plan, that the\nstate agencies involved had already given their preliminary approval and could be expected to give their final\napproval within 10 days after the court's approval, and that dental services would be provided by MDS within two\nweeks thereafter.\nThe plaintiffs' proposal also contained procedures and some 165 requirements for provision of dental care at BH.\nThe defendants' objected to it as excessively detailed and intrusive, going beyond the limits fixed by the Supreme\nCourt for judicial involvement in the operation and control of a state correctional facility. See Rhodes v. Chapman,\n452 U.S. 337, 351, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2401, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (courts should avoid issuing relief representing \"a\ncourt's idea of how best to operate a detention facility\"); Union County Jail Inmates v.

Some of the detailed specific requirements to which the defendants objected in\nletters to the court included the following:\n(1) Specific time frames for treatment. Objected to as inconsistent with sound medical practice;\n(2) Independent compliance audits or monitor systems. Defendants prefer quarterly audits\nprepared by MDS for DOCS Dental Review Committee;\n(3) Multi-language requirements in dealing with patients. Defendants urge that orientation in\nEnglish and Spanish is sufficient;\n(4) Establishment of specific number of days for treatment steps and time frames for delivery of\ndental care. Objected to by defendants as unrealistic and not gauged to patient's needs;\n(5) Written notification to each patient of time of next appointment. Objected to on security\ngrounds, with defendants favoring oral notification and delivery of daily written callout slips to\npatients;\n(6) Inspections of dental clinics by plaintiffs on 72 hours notice. Objected to as disruptive and\nunnecessary in view of MDS' independence and its agreement to furnish the court and plaintiffs\nwith any and all reports, internal evaluations and audits, and computer printouts of services\nprepared by MDS;\n(7) Provision against disciplining of inmates for requesting dental sick call even if found to be\nunnecessary and an abuse of the system. Objected to on the ground that due process discipline is\nnecessary to prevent manipulation of system by prisoners;\n(8) Dental treatment priorities. Objected to on the ground that the American Dental Association's\npriorities, which are incorporated in the defendants' Plan are more comprehensive;\n(9) Dental sick call referrals from facility health staff. Objected to as too broad and open-ended\nand on ground that the MDS system is more appropriate;\n(10) Evaluation systems. Defendants prefer systems drawn up by MDS and found in its Policies\nand Procedures Manual for BH;\n(11) Chart entries and monthly reports. Defendants prefer usual types of records and reports kept\nby professionals on basis of need rather than those based on court deadlines.\nSimultaneously the defendants submitted to Judge Kram a schedule comparing in detail the plaintiffs' and\ndefendants' proposed plans and requested the court to approve the latter.\n\nThus appellants did not object to the concept of a plan containing specific provisions but to those features of the\nplaintiffs' plan considered to be unnecessary, in conflict with established medical practice, excessively intrusive,\nunrealistic, or threatening to MDS itself. In the last category was a proposal that MDS furnish a copy of the\nplaintiffs' plan to its professional staff with a notice that any violation might result in a fine or imprisonment. On\nMarch 19, 1986, not having been accorded a hearing by the court on the parties' objections to each others' plans\nand receiving no court ruling as to the plan that would be approved, defendant Coughlin entered into a contract\nwith MDS which was approved by the Attorney General on March 25, 1986, and by the New York State\nComptroller on March 27, 1986.\nDespite differences between the parties as to the terms of preliminary relief that should issue pursuant to the\ndistrict court's December 3, 1985, decision, the judge did not explore the matter further with the parties but on\nApril 1, 1986, issued a \"preliminary injunction\" which opened by criticizing the defendants for \"dilatory tactics\",\nnon-production of certain \"current dental records\", refusal to enter into settlement negotiations, resistance to\nlegitimate discovery requests, and \"failure even to attempt to improve dental services at Bedford Hills as\n211 ordered\". Dean v. Coughlin, 633 F.Supp. 308, 309 (S.D.N.Y.1986). *211 Judge Kram was apparently unaware of\nthe State's having already contracted with MDS for services according to the terms of its Plan since she stated,\n\"the Court encourages the defendants to continue their negotiations with MDS.\" Id. at 310. The preliminary\ninjunction then set forth in considerable detail the terms of a dental services program to be followed by BH.\nAlthough the injunction adopted some of the defendants' proposals (e.g., priority classifications) it for the most\npart incorporated the specific provisions proposed by the plaintiffs. The injunction commenced by establishing, as\nboth sides had suggested, a priority system, to be adopted within 10 days, for classification of patients as follows:\nClass One: non-priority\nClass Two: low-priority\nClass Three: high-priority\nClass Four: emergency\nThe priorities were listed in the following order: emergencies, elimination of pathosis and extraction of teeth;\nremoval of irritating conditions that may lead to malignancies; treatment of bone and soft tissue diseases; repair\nof injured or diseased teeth; and replacement of lost teeth and restoration of function. The order specified the\nassessment examinations to be given to the inmate population; systems for dental sick-call, appointments and\nfollow-up; treatment deadlines for non-emergency patients; handling of dental emergencies; maintenance of\nfacilities needed to carry out the court's injunction (including operatories, intra-oral X-ray unit, pan-oral X-ray unit,\nX-ray developer); personnel (including two full-time dentists, one full-time dental hygienist, one full-time dental\nassistant and one full-time dental records clerk); hours of operation; the dental records to be kept for each patient\n(including chart of teeth; medical history; assessment of periodontal condition; X-rays, which must be mounted or\notherwise affixed to the record; chronological entries for every patient encounter, which must show treatment\nfound by dentist to be needed, and the priority assigned to it; dentist's orders for follow-up examinations and\nmedication; and an individualized treatment plan for each patient).\nThe injunction ordered the defendants (1) to notify inmates within 10 days that they may request an assessment\nexamination by a dentist, (2) to complete such examinations within 45 days of the order; (3) to notify each inmate\nof the dentist's findings and of the inmate's treatment priorities; (4) to maintain a log of all patients so examined,\ncontaining details to be entered on the inmate's dental chart; and (5) to notify the court by detailed affidavit,\nfurnishing a copy of each log. Sign-up sheets conspicuously marked \"Requests for Dental Care\" were ordered to\nbe posted daily in all BH housing areas, with details to be furnished by the requesting inmate or, where it is not\nfeasible for the inmate to sign, to have facility personnel do so at the patient's request. Such sheets are to be\npicked up and delivered to the dental clinic daily by 9:00 A.M. The order further provided that all patients\nrequesting dental sick call must be examined within one week, that defendants must keep a daily log of all\npatients examined at sick call with specific information as to each such patient and file an affidavit within 45 days\nof the injunction to the effect that the court's sick-call system had been adopted.\n\nThe district court's preliminary injunction contains similar detailed provisions with respect to an appointment and\nfollow-up system, treatment deadlines for non-emergency patients and dental emergencies. Defendants were\nordered to give each patient, before leaving the dental clinic, a follow-up appointment slip specifying the date and\ntime of the appointment, to keep a \"prosthetic device log\" with specified information as to each patient requiring\nsuch a device and mandating a follow-up appointment, and a \"missed appointment log\". The deadlines for\ntreatment of non-emergency patients were fixed according to classification of the patient. For example, Class\nThree patients were required to be examined within 30 days after their being certified as such during the first\n212 three months after assessment. Specific *212 time periods and records were also fixed for all other non-\nemergency patients.\nThe defendants were further ordered to provide immediate access by the health care staff to dental emergency\ncases, with the examination to be made by a dentist on the day of the request or, if a dentist is not present, by a\nphysician or nurse, with dental examination to follow on the next day. Logs with respect to each such case were\nrequired to be kept. The court's order also provided that it was to be implemented by BH's security staff, which\nwas to transmit all requests for emergency dental assistance to the dental clinic and health staff by telephone and\nassist inmates who did not have direct access to sign-up sheets. Defendants were required within 5 days to\ndistribute the order to all BH inmates, post it conspicuously and orient all inmates as to the services available,\nprocedure for requesting services and the method of handling complaints. Plaintiffs' counsel were to have the\nright on 72 hours notice to inspect all BH dental care with or without experts and review records for compliance.\nDefendants were also ordered to designate a person to be responsible for receiving and investigating complaints.\nAn extremely detailed compliance report was required to be filed with the court every 30 days.\nOn April 17, 1986, the defendants furnished to Judge Kram a copy of the contract which the State had entered\ninto with MDS for provision of dental care at BH, pointing out the few respects in which it differed from the earlier\nPlan submitted on January 31, 1986, i.e., (1) use of State indemnification in lieu of malpractice insurance, (2)\npermission to MDS to have the option of replacing a dental assistant with a second dental hygienist, (3) option to\nMDS to employ additional dentists in place of dental hygienists or assistants without reducing the minimum\nstaffing level required. Also attached was a copy of detailed \"Policies and Procedures for Mobile Dental Services\nP.C. at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility,\" which had not been completed at the time of the January 31\nsubmission.\nThe 53-page MDS \"Policies and Procedures\" manual set forth in reasonable detail the organization's objectives\nat BH, standards to be followed by it in rendering dental service there, scheduling of elective and emergency\nvisits by inmates during working and non-working hours, dissemination of patients' appointment schedules and\ncall-out slips, use of MDS mobile dental units as an adjunct to BH's fixed premises (described in an MDS\nappendix), the method to be used for handling patient flow and emergencies, the type and contents of emergency\nkits to be located at BH's Dental Section, procedure for handling of complaints, form of patients' dental records to\nbe kept, systems for storage and retrieval of patients' dental records, measures for maintaining the security of\nsuch records, internal monitoring of the dental clinic on a continual basis, and a system for reporting the number\nof patients treated and procedures performed. The scope and type of dental service (e.g., preventive,\nprophylactic, diagnostic, relief of pain, emergency case) were described in detail. Treatment priorities were also\nset forth, including classification of patients into four categories, similar to those adopted by the American Dental\nAssociation and the court, scheduling of continuing care, and criteria for selecting patients to be examined, based\non treatment priorities. Emergency cases to be seen and treated on the same day were listed. Class 3 type\ncases, involving conditions requiring early treatment, were listed with the statement that they were to be seen \"as\nsoon as possible, not later than seven days after receipt of request\". Class 2 type cases, involving conditions\nrequiring treatment but not of an urgent nature, were listed as required to be \"seen on an elective basis,\nappointment scheduled not less than 30 days after the request and treatment initiated.\" Class 1 cases, those\napparently needing no dental treatment, were to be scheduled under \"a routine six month recall system.\" The\nprocedure for initial assessment, treatment protocol, initial evaluation, follow-up visits, post operative care,\n213 medical clearance and many more relevant matters were carefully *213 described and samples of the records\nand forms to be used were attached.\n\nThe defendants' April 17, 1986, letter requested Judge Kram to modify her April 1 injunction to incorporate the\nMDS plan instead of that specified by the order. The requested modification was not made by the court. This\nappeal followed.\nDISCUSSION\nAppellants contend that the district court erred in (1) adopting without a hearing its own detailed plan instead of\nthat proposed by them for curing the perceived constitutional deficiencies in the existing system, which were\nfound to be inadequate in the court's December 3, 1985, opinion, (2) failing to give them a reasonable opportunity\nto modify their own plan to the extent necessary to rectify any perceived constitutional inadequacies, (3) basing\nits injunction on findings that are not supported in the record, and (4) adopting a plan that is excessively detailed\nand improperly intrusive, regulating activities that do not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and thus exceeding\nthe court's jurisdiction. These contentions require a brief review of principles governing a federal court's exercise\nof its remedial powers with respect to a state's conduct of its activities.\nThe standard by which we are governed in reviewing the scope and type of injunctive relief issued by a district\ncourt is whether the injunction amounts to an abuse of its equitable remedial discretion. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 15-16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1275-76, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); Hanson\nTrust PLC v. SCM Corp., 774 F.2d 47, 54 (2d Cir.1985); Coca-Cola Co. v. Tropicana Products Inc., 690 F.2d 312,\n315 (2d Cir.1982). Although a federal district court's powers are broad, \"appropriate consideration must be given\nto principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief,\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S.\n362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976), particularly when it comes to regulating a state's\nadministration of its own facilities, including its schools and prisons, Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 352, 101\nS.Ct. 2392, 2402, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447 (1979); Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 & n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572 & n. 9, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); Preiser\nv. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491-92, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1837, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).\nOnce the district court finds an unconstitutional condition in a state's prisons, the court may be tempted to right\nthe wrong by assuming control of the entire system in which the offensive condition exists and prescribing a new\nsystem deemed to meet constitutional requirements. However, since the court is usually \"ill equipped to deal with\nthe increasingly urgent problems of prison administration,\" Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct.\n1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974), it owes \"deference to the appropriate prison authorities\", id., lest the\nimposition by the court of its own broad changes designed to cure a constitutional infirmity not only offend the\nstate's entitlement to respect but amount to an unnecessary overkill. We have repeatedly been cautioned (1) not\nto use a sledgehammer where a more delicate instrument will suffice, (2) not to move too quickly where it\nappears that the state, in the exercise of its administrative authority, will in its own way adopt reforms bringing its\nsystem into compliance with the Constitution, and (3) to give the state a reasonable opportunity to remedy a\nconstitutional deficiency, imposing upon it a court-devised solution only if the state plan proves to be unfeasible or\ninadequate for the purpose. Rhodes v. Chapman, supra, 452 U.S. at 351-52, 101 S.Ct. at 2401-02; Bell v.\nWolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 547-48, 99 S.Ct. at 1878; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2806,\n41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); Procunier v. Martinez, supra, 416 U.S. at 404-05, 94 S.Ct. at 1807.\nRestraint and initial deference to state institutional authorities in curing unconstitutional conditions are\n214 furthermore advisable as a matter of realism; federal courts lack the facilities or expertise needed for *214\nformulation and day-to-day administration of detailed plans designed to assure that a state will provide\nconstitutionally acceptable prison services. The court's limited resources and supervisory facilities must\naccordingly be restricted to intensive use only in those hardcore cases where a state has failed to come forward\nwith a reasonable plan or remedy. See, e.g., Hutto v. Finney, supra, 437 U.S. at 687 & n. 9, 98 S.Ct. at 2572 & n.\n9. A remedial court order must strike a balance between the court's obligation to identify and take steps toward\nthe elimination of constitutional violations and the state's right to administer its own prisons, with the state\ncontinuing to have the discretionary responsibility for devising and carrying out a plan whereby it will operate its\nfacilities in a constitutional manner as directed by the court. As the Supreme Court stated in Preiser v. Rodriguez,\nsupra, 411 U.S. at 491-92, 93 S.Ct. at 1837:\n\n\"[i]t is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more\nintricately bound up with state laws, regulations, and procedures, than the administration of its\nprisons ... Since these internal problems of state prisons involve issues so peculiarly within state\nauthority and expertise, the States have an important interest in not being bypassed in the\ncorrection of those problems ... The strong considerations of comity that require giving a state\ncourt system that has convicted a defendant the first opportunity to correct its own errors thus also\nrequire giving the States the first opportunity to correct the errors made in the internal\nadministration of their prisons.\" (footnote omitted).\nSee in accord Union County Jail Inmates v. DiBuono, supra, 713 F.2d at 1001-02; Ruiz v. Estelle, 679 F.2d 1115,\n1145, 1148 (5th Cir.),vacated in part as moot,688 F.2d 266 (5th Cir.1982),cert. denied,460 U.S. 1042, 103\nS.Ct. 1438, 75 L.Ed.2d 795 (1983); Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237 (9th Cir.1982),appeal after remand sub nom. \nHoptowit v. Spellman, 753 F.2d 779 (9th Cir.1985).\nPlaintiffs' reliance upon our decision in Todaro v. Ward, 565 F.2d 48 (2d Cir.1977), for the proposition that the\ndistrict court may without hearing impose in the first instance its own detailed remedial order is misplaced. In that\ncase the order was not a preliminary one, such as that at issue here, but a final judgment issued after a full-scale\nlengthy trial. Although one would expect such a judgment to be more detailed than a preliminary injunction, it was\nnevertheless narrow in scope; we described it as \"instituting ... narrow reforms [which] will not be unduly\nburdensome or costly.\" Id. at 54 (footnote omitted). Moreover, in a detailed opinion the trial judge \"rejected many\nof appellees' claims of inadequate medical care, drawing careful distinctions between those practices which,\nwhile perhaps undesirable, do not amount to constitutional infractions, and those that do.\" Id. at 53 (footnote\nomitted). Lastly, the Todaro defendants, unlike those here, do not appear to have taken issue with the district\ncourt's refusal to accept the scope of the remedy proposed by them, i.e., whether deference should be paid to\ntheir proposed implementation, but with the need for any remedy at all.\nApplying the foregoing principles to the present case, although the district court's December 3, 1985, opinion\ngranting preliminary relief was thoroughly considered, its April 1, 1986, issuance of its own remedial order,\ninstead of using as its guide the thorough MDS Plan subject to minor modifications, departed from basic concepts\nof comity and federalism by which we are governed. In brief, the court went too far and too fast in imposing upon\nthe state correctional facility its own ideas of how a prison dental clinic should be organized and administered\nrather than giving appropriate deference to the State's Plan. Although the latter, as submitted by the defendants\non January 31, 1986, pursuant to the court's order and supplemented by the MDS detailed \"Policies and\nProcedures\" manual, may not necessarily be fully adequate as it stands, it appears to provide a reasonable\n215 remedy to be implemented by *215 an independent, objective organization with extensive experience in the\ndelivery of dental care to numerous institutions, for each of the constitutional deficiencies forming the basis of the\ndistrict court's December 3, 1985, decision. Even the plaintiffs, while objecting to some of the MDS Plan's\nprovisions, apparently felt compelled to recognize its basic adequacy, stating to the district court that \"there is a\nstriking degree of harmony in the substantive approaches offered by the parties.\"\nWe cannot agree that the district court was justified in its action by any delay or dragging of feet on the State's\npart. Following its May 3, 1985, hearing on plaintiffs' application for preliminary relief, the court itself had waited\nfor six months, i.e., until December 3, 1985, to enter its decision, a delay undoubtedly due to its overwhelming\ncaseload. In view of the many provisions which were then required to be drafted by the parties and incorporated\ninto a suitable remedial plan, the two-month period taken by them thereafter to prepare and submit their\nrespective proposed plans does not seem to have been excessive.\nUnder all of the circumstances, it was an abuse of discretion for the district court not to use the State's carefully\nand conscientiously formulated remedial plan as the basis for relief, with such modifications as might appear\nessential to assure compliance with minimum constitutional requirements. It must be remembered that the State\nis not constitutionally obligated, much as it may be desired by inmates, to construct a perfect plan for dental care\nthat exceeds what the average reasonable person would expect or avail herself of in life outside the prison walls.\nThe BH correctional facility is not a health spa, but a prison in which convicted felons are incarcerated. Common\nexperience indicates that the great majority of BH prisoners would not in freedom or on parole enjoy the\nexcellence in dental care which the plaintiffs understandably seek on their behalf. We are governed by the\n\nprinciple that the objective is not to impose upon a state prison a model system of dental care beyond average\nneeds but to \"provide the minimum level of [dental] care required by the Constitution.\" Ruiz v. Estelle, supra, 679\nF.2d at 1150. \"The Constitution does not command that inmates be given the kind of medical attention that\njudges would wish to have for themselves....\" Id. at 1149. \"[T]he essential test is one of medical necessity and not\none simply of desirability.\" Woodall v. Foti, 648 F.2d 268, 272 (5th Cir.1981) (citation omitted).\nAppellees' contention, that the Plan proposed by the defendants fails to meet the requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65\n(d) that it be \"specific in terms\" because it was to be incorporated by reference in a proposed order rather than\nset forth in haec verba in the order itself and because the State's contract with MDS had not been signed by the\nparties at the time when it was submitted for approval, must be rejected as bordering on the frivolous. The terms\nof the MDS Plan, as amplified by its \"Policies and Procedures for Mobile Dental Services P.C. at Bedford Hills\nCorrectional Facility\" were sufficiently specific and detailed to preclude any substantial issues as to enforceability\nor compliance that might otherwise arise because of vagueness. The court's incorporation of these specific terms\nby reference in an order, to which they are attached, would fully satisfy the requirements of Rule 65(d).\nNor can we agree with appellees' contention that the differences between the defendants' proposed order and\nthat formulated by the court are so minimal as to be insignificant. The defendants' concerns related to serious\nremedial provisions, including certain specific time frames and artificial treatment deadlines believed to be\nunrealistic or aimed at achieving a perfect or ideal system of care rather than one mandated by the Constitution.\n216 [2] Some of defendants' objections to the plaintiffs' proposed *216 plan, which were voiced in detail in defendants'\nFebruary 7, 1986, letter to the court, apply equally to similar provisions in the court's later April 1, 1986, order.\nOn the other hand, we cannot accept the defendants' suggestion that, although they are prepared voluntarily to\nimplement all provisions of the MDS Plan, the district court is barred by the Eleventh Amendment from requiring\ncertain specific actions, such as adherence to specific time deadlines. Although some provisions of the MDS\nPlan, standing alone, may go beyond what is constitutionally mandated, the district court may, in view of the\ndefendants' past failure to provide the minimum level of dental care required by the Constitution, insure that that\nlevel will in the future be met by ordering the adoption of measures that would not otherwise be appropriate. If\nexperience under the MDS Plan reveals that some of these specific provisions are no longer necessary, the\ndistrict court may then be obligated to delete them upon the defendants' motion. In any event, the defendants will\nfurther be protected against inappropriate or unnecessary strictures by a provision in the order authorizing the\ntreating dentist to depart from the injunction's deadlines for sound medical reasons.\nAccordingly, we direct that the district court's preliminary injunction be vacated and that upon remand the district\ncourt issue an order directing the defendants to comply with the detailed terms of the MDS Plan (including its\ndeadlines and time frames) as amplified by its \"Policies and Procedures For Mobile Dental Services P.C. at\nBedford Hills Correctional Facility.\" The order should contain (1) a provision similar to that found in Par. IX B of\nthe district court's April 1, 1986, order authorizing the treating dentist to depart from any provision when in the\ndentist's opinion adherence with respect to a patient would be contrary to sound medical judgment, and (2) a\nprovision authorizing the defendants, whenever any part of the order no longer appears to be constitutionally\nmandated, to move for relief from such a provision, which shall not be unreasonably denied.\nThe preliminary injunction is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n[1] Trial of the plaintiffs' action for a permanent injunction is scheduled to begin on November 3, 1986.\n[2] Moreover, the threat that precise time deadlines or time frames in the preliminary injunction ultimately to be\nissued by the court would face the defendants with unjustified contempt charges based on non-compliance may\nbe minimized by incorporating a provision, such as that in Par. IX B of the district court's April 1, 1986, order,\nauthorizing a dentist to deviate therefrom when adherence would be contrary to sound medical judgment. Par. IX\nB provides: \n\"B. Whenever, in the professional opinion of the treating dentist, commencement or continuation of treatment for\na particular patient within the deadlines imposed by this Order is contrary to sound medical judgment, the\n\ndentist's opinion shall control. In such cases, the dentist shall enter on that patient's dental chart the reasons why\nadherence to the Court's deadline for that patient is contrary to sound medical judgment. A monthly report of all\nsuch cases shall be made to the Court and to plaintiffs' counsel.\"\nThis reasonable provision could be supplemented by one authorizing the defendants, whenever any part of the\norder no longer appears to be constitutionally required, to move in the district court for its exclusion, which should\nbe granted if the court agreed.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Gen., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nKRAM, District Judge.\nPlaintiffs, who represent a class consisting of all persons who are or will be confined at Bedford Hills Correctional\nFacility (\"Bedford Hills\") during the pendency of this case, bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming\nthat the dental care provided at Bedford Hills violates their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the United States Constitution.\nNamed as defendants are: Thomas A. Coughlin III, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of\nCorrectional Services, Raymond Broaddus, Assistant Commissioner for Health Services of the New York State\nDepartment of Correctional Services; Sydney Pollard, Dental Director of the New York State Department of\nCorrectional Services; Frank Headley, Superintendent of Bedford Hills; Jimmie Harris, Health Administrator of\n[1]\nBedford Hills; and Stefan Sherman,  dentist at Bedford Hills. Plaintiffs allege a complete breakdown of dental\nservices at Bedford Hills, characterized by the failure to examine inmates when they arrive and when they\nrequest routine care, a long backlog in examining inmates who seek emergency care, and the failure to schedule\nfollow-up appointments ordered by the facility dentist. Plaintiffs allege that as a result of this breakdown, Bedford\nHills' inmates have suffered pain and permanent damage to their health.\nThis case is presently before the Court on plaintiffs' motion, pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n394 Procedure, for a preliminary injunction ordering defendants *394 to provide adequate dental care to inmates at\nBedford Hills.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI. Background\nThe Bedford Hills Correctional Facility is the largest state correctional facility for women in New York, housing\napproximately 570 to 600 inmates. It is also the only maximum security prison for women in New York. It serves\nas both a permanent correctional facility for some inmates, and a reception center for all women felons in New\nYork State, regardless of where they are eventually to be incarcerated. According to the New York State\n[2]\nDepartment of Correction Services policy guidelines for dental services , the dental clinic at Bedford is\nresponsible for giving an intake examination to all new inmates, whether they are to be incarcerated permanently\nat Bedford Hills or elsewhere, and performing preventive, prophylactic, and other routine dental services for\npermanent Bedford Hills inmates. The clinic consists of two operatories, which consist of a chair, light, instrument\n\ntable, and cuspidor. The staff is presently composed of one full-time dentist, two part-time temporary dentists,\none dental hygienist, and one clerk.\nII. Administration of the Dental Clinic\nA. Initial Screening\nThe first step in the provision of dental care at Bedford Hills is the initial screening exam which is to be performed\non all incoming inmates. The exam is performed either by the dental hygenist or the dentist, and consists of\ntaking the patient's medical history and charting her teeth. The purpose of this exam is threefold: to identify\ninmates, to identify problems needing attention, and to detect and treat emergency conditions. Both the\ndefendants' and plaintiffs' prison dental experts testified that it is good prison dental practice to perform initial\nexams within fourteen days. Bedford Hills' regulations also call for initial exams within fourteen days.\nAs Dr. Sherman, the Bedford Hills dentist testified, however, inmates can wait four months or more for an initial\nscreening, and the record is replete with examples of inmates who waited at least four months for initial exams.\nFor example, Mary Jenkins arrived at Bedford Hills in August, 1984 and was not seen until January, 1985, a\nperiod of five months, during which she made numerous requests for treatment. Kathy Boudin stated in an\naffidavit that she arrived at Bedford Hills in May, 1984 and was not seen until December, 1984 and her dental\nchart confirms this.\nThe record also establishes that some patients have never received an initial screening examination or any other\nexamination. Clara Karnbach, who arrived in September, 1983, has never been examined, and Dr. Sherman, in\nhis affidavit, indicated he could not locate a chart for her. The Court also finds that Elizabeth Roman, who made\nnumerous requests to see the dentist and whose chart defendants could not locate, also has never been\nexamined by the dentist.\nWhile some inmates, such as Maureen Ragsdale, who arrived at Bedford Hills on June 21, 1984 and was\nexamined that month, are seen promptly, many are not. The failure to give initial examinations to so many\ninmates prevents the dental clinic from establishing an orderly and efficient system for delivering dental services\nto inmates. Without carrying out prompt initial screening examinations on all inmates, the clinic has no way to\nprioritize the inmates' dental needs. The dentist does not know which inmates need immediate attention for pain,\n395 and which inmates need care that can wait. As defendants' own expert, *395 Dr. Conte, testified, the initial\nscreening exam should set up the entire classification system for an orderly treatment of dental patients in a\nprison.\nB. Requests for Routine Care\nAccording to the defendants' guidelines, policy memoranda, and testimony, routine dental care includes\nexaminations, fillings, cleaning, extractions, dentures, root canal, and gum treatment. Inmates request routine\ncare by filling out \"Request for Dental Appointment\" forms, and by returning them to a member of the dental\nclinic, who places names on waiting lists and schedules appointments. The dental clinic is then supposed to\nacknowledge receipt of the request and send an appointment date to the inmate.\nThe Court finds that the system for providing routine care at Bedford Hills is defunct. Dr. Sherman admitted that\nhe does not use the request forms, which he characterizes as worthless. Della Sutton, the dental hygienist,\nplaces the requests in a gauze box, and does not use them. The clinic does not send acknowledgements, make\nappointments or compile waiting lists. In fact, over three hundred request forms or notes seeking appointments\nhave been filed since January, 1984, and nothing has been done with them. Defendants' own expert, Dr. Conte,\nstated that a prison dental clinic's failure to respond to over 300 requests for routine care would present a\nproblem. The Court agrees. The dental clinic's failure to answer these routine requests for care both denies\ninmates treatment and forces them to seek care outside of normal channels.\n\nC. Requests for Emergency Care\nDr. Sherman defines a dental emergency as swollen or infected gums, a broken denture, or pain in the teeth or\nmouth. The defendants' guidelines for requesting emergency care, as well as a memo to the inmates, describe\nBedford Hills' system for providing emergency care. Inmates needing emergency care are to sign up on the\nnurse's screening list or sick call sign-up sheet, both of which are posted every morning in the housing units. The\nlists are examined to determine which complaints are real emergencies, and the dental hygienist is then\nresponsible for arranging for the emergency patients to see the dentist. Inmates are informed that they can\nrequest emergency care at night and on weekends and are warned not to use the emergency sign-up sheets to\nmake appointments for routine care.\nAs with the system for requesting routine care, the process for requesting emergency care at Bedford Hills has\nbroken down. Inmates sign the daily sick call sign-up sheets or the nurse's screening list, but are not seen for\nmonths. For example, Helen Richardson signed up for emergency care sixteen times between October, 1984 and\nMarch, 1985. She was never called to see the dentist. Shirley White signed up for emergency care on March 20,\n1985 and has not been seen by the dentist. Laura Whitmore signed the sick-call sheet on February 25, 1985 but\nhas yet to see the dentist. Mary Jenkins, who lost a tooth from a lower denture, requested emergency care ten\ntimes between August, 1984 and January, 1985 before finally seeing the dentist. Hannah Coch requested\nemergency assistance thirteen times in March, 1985 but has not been seen.\nDefendants admit that there are long delays in treating inmates who request emergency care. Dr. Sherman\nstated that it often takes him three days to see all the patients on one day's emergency list. At first glance, this\nmight not seem problematic. However, Dr. Sherman stated that as of April, 1985, he was still working on the\nemergency list from February, 1985. Dr. Conte, the defendants' expert, stated that in light of this backlog, Bedford\nHills does not really have a system for treating patients who need emergency care. The Court agrees.\nDefendants, while admitting that there are long delays in providing treatment to inmates who request emergency\n396 care, assert that most patients who request emergency care are not emergencies at all, but *396 use the nurse's\nscreening and sick call sheets as a means of requesting routine care. To support this contention, defendants\nstate that while many inmates sign up for emergency care during weekday mornings, few sign up at night or on\nweekends. Defendants also claim that inmates abuse the emergency sign-up process, and point to inmates such\nas Miriam Acevedo who testified that she signs up for emergency care even when she is not in pain. Thus,\ndefendants essentially state that they use the emergency request list as a means of providing routine care\nbecause patients on the emergency list need only routine care. However, since the clinic has not even seen\nmany of the patients on the list, it has no way of knowing which inmates warrant emergency treatment.\nDefendants' attempt to blame the inmates for the backlog in emergency care is also misplaced. Lacking\nscreening exams and responses to routine care requests, inmates understandably realize that the only way to\nreceive dental treatment is to request emergency care, whether they need it or not. The backlog in emergency\ncare is thus the result of the breakdown in initial screening and routine care procedures.\nD. Follow-up Appointments\nThe record also indicates that the dental clinic is lax in scheduling and keeping follow-up appointments ordered\nby the dentist. For example, Miriam Acevedo's dental chart indicates that during the course of treatment for a cap\non her tooth, the dentist ordered four follow-up visits, none of which were kept on time, and for one of which\nAcevedo waited one year. During this time, the record indicates Acevedo made numerous requests for dental\ncare, including personal visits to the dentist, but was not seen for treatment. Karen White, who was treated for\nsinitis, was scheduled for follow-up care within one to two days, but was seen nine days later. Her dental chart\nindicates she was in pain throughout that period. Ruth Kitchens was treated for a broken tooth on April 18, 1984;\nthe dentist ordered another visit in one week, but did not see her for eight months. She testified that she was in\npain while waiting to see the dentist. Dr. Sherman, while testifying that the follow-up care system was working\nproperly at Bedford Hills, admitted that there was no record that he saw inmates Sondra Halpin, Estella\n\nCoronado, Miriam Acevedo, Lydia Cerillo, and Debra Buford, among others, within the time ordered for follow-up\ncare.\nThe record indicates there are occasions when patients see the dentist for a follow-up visit within the time\nordered. Helen Richardson, for example, testified on cross-examination that she saw Dr. Sherman for a check-up\nthree days after a tooth was removed. But such examples do not mitigate the damage and pain caused by the\nseries of failures to provide follow-up care. Nor do they indicate that the system of follow-up care is working\nproperly at Bedford Hills.\nE. Summary\nThe above findings demonstrate a total breakdown in the administration of the dental clinic at Bedford Hills. The\nfailure to perform initial exams, the collapse of the system for requesting routine care, the backlog in emergency\nrequests, and the failure to keep follow-up appointments all create a labyrinth in which inmates at Bedford Hills,\nfacing sundry obstacles, use various means to see the dentist in the hope that although many of their attempts\nwill fail, they will eventually obtain treatment. Besides signing up for routine and emergency care, inmates are\nforced to go outside the regular prisoner process to get treatment. They request the help of prison health\nadministrator, Jimmie Harris, accost Dr. Sherman in the hallway, write letters to both, and visit the clinic without\nappointments. Some inmates negotiate their way to treatment, but in no apparent relation to their needs.\nDefendants attempt to use these examples to demonstrate that the dental chair is accessible and that inmates\n397 are being treated. But under such an anarchical system, many inmates 00 be they quiet or even unlucky *397 00\n97 97\nhave suffered while awaiting the treatment that could relieve them, while others who do not need immediate\ntreatment have been seen. Maureen Ragsdale, Clara Karnbach, Laura Whitmore, Dawn Boykin, and Mary\nJenkins all testified that they were in pain while waiting months for requested treatment.\nIII. Provision of Dental Services\nThe dental services offered by the clinic at Bedford Hills can be divided into four categories: prophylactic care,\nrestorative care, extractions, and prosthetics services. The evidence demonstrates that the collapse in the\nadministration of the Bedford Hills dental clinic has caused a breakdown in the provision of dental services.\nA. Prophylactic Care\nProphylactic treatment for teeth is a special cleaning which only a dentist is able to provide. Plaintiffs' expert, Dr.\nVillacara, stated that wise dental policy calls for prophylactic treatment once every six months. Failure to provide\ntimely and consistent care can lead to inflamed and bleeding gums, periodontal disease, and loose or lost teeth.\nSuch disease would not begin to develop, according to Dr. Villacara, until at least a year after the last treatment.\nThus, as defendants' expert Dr. Conte testified, prophylaxis is not a priority treatment, but it is important. The\nrecord indicates that Bedford Hills generally does not provide regular prophylactic care to the inmates.\nHelen Richardson has not had her teeth cleaned since her arrival at Bedford Hills in March, 1984. Her dental\nrecords indicate that the clinic ordered a cleaning in July, 1984. Miriam Acevedo has not had her teeth cleaned in\nthree years. Virginia Maddox has not had prophylactic treatment in her four years at Bedford Hills. Dawn Boykin\nhas not received a cleaning since her arrival at Bedford Hills in May, 1983, even though the dentist noted on her\nrecord that she needed one in July, 1984. The evidence thus indicates that Bedford Hills rarely provides\nprophylactic care to inmates.\nB. Restorative Care\nRestorative services generally include filling cavities, doing root canal work, and crowning broken teeth. Failure to\nperform restorative work when needed can result in pain and the loss of teeth. The record indicates that there are\noften unacceptably long delays in the provision of restorative service at Bedford Hills.\n\nMaureen Ragsdale was diagnosed as possibly needing crowns on July 5, 1984. On November 11, 1984 she\nvisited the dentist because the teeth needing crowns had fractured. The dentist did not begin to insert the crowns\nuntil February 20, 1985, nearly seven months after the need for crowns was first identified, and three months\nafter her tooth had cracked. Ragsdale testified that during the time she waited for treatment she was suffering\nfrom pain and throbbing in her teeth, and headaches.\nAccording to Dr. Villacara, plaintiffs' expert, if the crowns had been inserted immediately in July, the tooth would\nnot have fractured. Dr. Sherman stated in an affidavit that the need to perform the services was not diagnosed as\ndefinite until November and that the patient would have been helped on January 17, but she did not show up at\nthe clinic. Even accepting both of Dr. Sherman's assertions as true, Ragsdale still waited in pain for two months\nfor treatment diagnosed by Dr. Sherman himself as necessary. Clara Karnbach testified that while incarcerated\nshe had cavities needing fillings and that her wisdom teeth often caused her pain. As the Court found earlier,\nClara Karnbach has never seen a dentist at Bedford Hills, despite many requests for appointments.\nMany other patients have been diagnosed as having cavities but have not received fillings. Linda Green has\nwaited eight months, Luba Mack has waited ten months, and Estella Coronado has waited one year and four\nmonths for fillings. These are but a few examples from the record.\n398 *398 Inmate Dawn Boykin was having problems with her upper right middle tooth when she saw the dentist on\nAugust 30, 1983. The clinic took x-rays of her tooth three times because it lost them twice. She finally was\ndiagnosed as having a cavity, and it was filled in December, 1983, but the tooth had to be pulled in May, 1984.\nThe witness testified that throughout this period, including the time after the tooth was pulled, she was in pain.\nShe also unsuccessfully sought dental attention numerous times.\nIn July, 1984 Boykin was diagnosed as needing a crown on one tooth and suffering from a deep carious lesion\nand mesial decay on two others. She testified that her teeth hurt so much she often cried. Plaintiffs' expert\ntestified that failure to treat a deep carious lesion could result in further decay and eventual loss of the tooth.\nDespite making thirteen requests to see the dentist, she was not treated until December 7, 1984, a period of\nnearly five months. She did see the hygienist on September 5, but received no treatment. When she saw the\ndentist for treatment on December 7, she claimed that while Dr. Sherman was examining her, he became too\nfamiliar with her, and Dr. Sherman suggested that she come back for treatment another time.\nThe Court finds that Dr. Sherman was only attempting to examine Boykin when she claimed he became too\nfamiliar with her. So the failure to treat Dawn Boykin on December 7 was due to an unfortunate misunderstanding\nbetween doctor and patient. However, this incident in no way justifies the five months Boykin waited for treatment\nbetween July and December.\nC. Extractions\nShirley White's dental record indicates that on September 4, 1984, she needed three teeth extracted. One of\nthese teeth was apparently on her sinus line, and she was in pain. Dr. Sherman indicated on her chart that she\nwas to be seen in approximately seven days. Two months later she was transferred to Albion State Prison without\nhaving been seen and thus without having the teeth pulled. She returned to Bedford Hills a year later in\nNovember, 1984 and has still not seen the dentist, despite two requests. There is no record that the teeth were\never pulled. Currently, she is suffering from sore gums and cannot eat meat.\nKaren Jamison's dental chart indicates Dr. Sherman diagnosed her as needing two teeth extracted on July 19,\n1984. One tooth was filled seven months later, the other has never been filled according to her chart, although Dr.\nSherman states in an affidavit that it was filled on April 23, 1985. Even assuming his statement is true, she waited\nnine months for all fillings to be completed. Among the many other inmates who have waited months for\nextractions are Marie Smily and Rosaura Gonzalez, who are still waiting for extractions after waiting ten and five\n[3]\nmonths, respectively.\n\nThe Court finds, based on the expert testimony adduced at trial, that failure to perform needed extraction within a\nreasonable time can result in unrelieved pain and, if the delay is long enough, infection and damage to the roots\nand jawbone. Dr. Sherman claimed in his testimony that only one percent of patients needing extractions ever\nsuffer from infection. Even if the Court accepts this as true, the fact that so few people suffer infection is no\nexcuse for long delays in performing needed extractions. Furthermore, even if a patient needing an extraction\ndoes not develop an infection, she would almost always be in pain.\nD. Prosthetic Services\nProsthetic services encompass replacing teeth that are missing. There are two basic sorts of prosthetic devices\n00 fixed and removable. Fixed prosthetic devices are commonly known as bridges and removable prosthetics are\n97\n399 known as dentures. Dr. Villacara and Dr. Conte agreed that a person *399 in need of dentures would have\ndifficulty chewing food, which would in turn lead to digestion problems. Dr. Villacara also stated that the facial\ndistortion resulting from missing teeth could lead to psychological problems. Dr. Conte stated the provision of\ndentures is the second dental priority in the New Jersey State Prison System, and that it should take from one to\nsix months for a denture case to be completed. The record indicates that, as with other dental services at Bedford\nHills, the provision of prosthetics is severely lacking.\nRuth Kitchens' dental chart indicates that she needed partial upper and partial lower dentures as of April 18,\n1984. She testified that the hygienist recognized her need for dentures during a visit in December 1983, but the\nfirst time a dentist entered such a diagnosis on her chart was in April, 1984. She finally received a transitional\ndenture in April, 1985, after a year's delay.\nMary Jenkins has full upper and lower dentures. In August, 1984 she lost a tooth from her lower denture. When\nshe eats, particles of food go straight through the hole left in the denture and irritate her gums. As a result, she\ncannot eat properly. She had made numerous requests for a dental appointment, but was not seen until January\n22, 1985. At that visit, Dr. Sherman asked Jenkins to leave the dentures for repair, but the dental chart and Dr.\nSherman's affidavit indicate that she refused to leave them. Jenkins testified that she refused because Dr.\nSherman claimed the repairs would not work and that she needed new dentures anyway. The Court finds that her\nrefusal to leave the denture for repair was reasonable because if she had, she would not have had any lower\nteeth.\nInmate Penny Rose's need for full dentures was identified on October 29, 1983. All of her teeth were extracted by\nDecember, 1983. Dr. Sherman testified that she then should have waited six to eight weeks before impressions\nfor dentures were taken in order to let her mouth recover. The impressions were not taken until July, 1984, a full\nseven months later, and she did not receive the dentures until March, 1985, eight months after the impressions\nwere taken and fifteen months after she was first diagnosed as needing dentures. During the time she was\nwithout teeth, the record indicates she lost fifteen pounds and was placed on Sustacal, a food supplement. Dr.\nSherman asserts that the delay in taking the impressions was due to recurring cold sores. But no cold sores were\nindicated on her record between December, 1983 and June, 1984, and in fact she did not even see the dentist\nduring this time. Cold sores should not cause a seven month delay. Cold sores were noted on Rose's chart on\nJune 26, 1984, and she received impressions less than a month later. Thus, if the clinic acted immediately after a\ncase of cold sores was over, it could have taken the impressions sooner. Even if the Court accepts Dr. Sherman's\nassertions that cold sores prevented impressions from being taken, this does not explain the eight month gap\nbetween the taking of the impressions and the insertion of the dentures.\nThe record indicates that these are not isolated incidents, but are part of a pattern of delay in the provision of\nprosthetic care at Bedford Hills. For example, Peggy Southerland waited one year for full upper and lower\ndentures, Kathleen Riley has waited fourteen months for partial upper and lower dentures that have yet to\nappear, and Lydia Cirillo has waited eighteen months.\n\nIV. Efforts to Improve the Quality of Care at Bedford Hills\nThe defendants admitted during the hearings that the provision of dental care at Bedford Hills has not been\nsufficient, but they claim they have tried to and have, in fact, improved the care at Bedford Hills. The record\nshows that defendants have made a number of requests to the State for additional staffing at Bedford Hills. In\nSeptember, 1982, Health Services Administrator Jimmie Harris wrote a memo to the Regional Director seeking\n400 permission to hire a dental assistant at Bedford Hills. *400 Dr. Broaddus wrote memos in support of this request\nin October and November, 1982. In February and March, 1984, Harris sought a temporary dentist for Bedford to\nhelp clear up the backlog that developed under Dr. Collings. A temporary, half-time dentist was approved by the\nstate in November, 1984.\nThe State has also provided Bedford Hills with a mobile health service unit which includes an additional half-time\ndentist. The dental assistant request has not been approved by the State, but the clinic has added a clerk to help\nwith record-keeping. Defendants also have plans to improve and expand the physical facilities at the dental clinic.\nThe plans call for expanding the clinic so that it will contain four operatories. Physical construction for the\noperatories has not yet begun. The Court notes that all the improvements have been implemented after the\ninstitution of this lawsuit. Furthermore, these efforts have not resulted in improvement of the provision of dental\nservices at Bedford Hills.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nIn order to obtain a preliminary injunction in this Circuit a party must demonstrate:\n(a) irreparable harm and (b) either (1) likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious\nquestions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships\ntipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.\nJack Kahn Music Co. v. Baldwin Piano and Organ Co., 604 F.2d 755, 758 (2d Cir. 1979).\nWhen a party is seeking a mandatory preliminary injunction, as plaintiffs do here, the standard for the second\nprong of the test is even higher. Jacobson and Co., Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Co., 548 F.2d 438, 441 (2d Cir.1977).\nThe moving party must make a clear showing that it is entitled to the relief it requests or that extreme and serious\ndamage would result from a denial of preliminary relief. Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d Cir.\n1985). And when, as here, the preliminary injunction will grant the moving party substantially all the relief it\nultimately seeks, the party must fulfill an even more stringent standard. It must show a substantial likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits. Wali, 754 F.2d at 1026.\nI. Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nA federal district court faces the prospect of enjoining prison officials to provide certain services to inmates with\nsome trepidation. This Court recognizes that it is not an expert in prison administration and is not in command of\nall the resources necessary to resolve prison problems. See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct.\n1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). The Court thus must give due deference to the judgment prison officials have\nexercised in establishing prison procedures. The Court must not simply implement its own idea of the ideal way\nto run a prison. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1874, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nThe Court recognizes also, however, that it is required to act if it finds that the federal constitutional rights of the\nBedford Hills inmates have been violated. When dental or medical needs are involved, an inmate is completely\nreliant on the state and prison for care. When the care is not forthcoming, a court is often the only place an\ninmate can turn for help. With this tension between individuals' rights and the limited role a court plays in prison\nreform in mind, the Court turns to the merits.\n\nA. The Eighth Amendment Standard\nThe Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States requires a state to provide medical care to those\nwhom it punishes by incarceration. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976),reh.\nden.,429 U.S. 1066, 97 S.Ct. 798, 50 L.Ed.2d 785 (1977). A state's obligations applies to dental care as well. \n401 Chapman v. Rhodes, 434 F.Supp. 1007, 1020 (S.D.Ohio 1977),aff'd,624 F.2d *401 1099 (6th Cir.1980),rev. in\nother part, 452 U.S. 337, 344, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2398, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); Barnes v. Virgin Islands, 415 F.Supp.\n1218, 1235 (D.V.I.1976). In numerous other cases, courts have applied the Eighth Amendment to dental care at\nprisons. See, e.g., Fields v. Gander, 734 F.2d 1313, 1314 (8th Cir.1984); Robbins v. South, 595 F.Supp. 785, 788\n(D.Mont.1984); Shaffer v. McWilliams, 570 F.Supp. 1422 (W.D.N.Y.1983); Clifton v. Robinson, 500 F.Supp. 30, 35\n(E.D.Pa.1980); Nicholson v. Choctaw County, 498 F.Supp. 295, 297 (S.D.Ala.1980); Stokes v. Hurdle, 393\nF.Supp. 757, 761 (D.Md.1975),aff'd,535 F.2d 1250 (4th Cir.1976).\nA state is not required to fulfill all of the dental or medical needs of its prisoners. Rather, it must not be\ndeliberately indifferent to the \"serious medical needs of the prisoners....\" Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104, 97 S.Ct. at 291.\nThe two relevant questions under the Eighth Amendment are thus what constitutes deliberate difference and\nwhat is a serious medical or dental need. See Harding v. Kuhlmann, 588 F.Supp. 1315, 1316 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (to\nmake a claim under the Eighth Amendment, plaintiff must show allegations of serious medical needs and\ndeliberate indifference on the part of the prison officials to those needs) (Weinfeld, J.), aff'd,762 F.2d 990 (2d\nCir.1985).\nIn Estelle, the Court ruled that deliberate indifference can be manifested by a doctor's refusal to administer\nneeded treatment, a prison guard's intentional denial or delay in granting an inmate access to medical care, or\nhis intentional interference with prescribed treatment. Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. at 291-92. The\nSecond Circuit has articulated its interpretation of Estelle's deliberate indifference standard. In Todaro v. Ward,\n431 F.Supp. 1129 (S.D. N.Y.1977),aff'd,565 F.2d 48 (2d Cir.1977), Judge Ward ruled that there are two\ncategories of deliberate indifference: denied or unreasonably delayed access to a physician for diagnosis and\ntreatment and failure to administer treatment prescribed by a physician. Todaro, 431 F.Supp. at 1132-33. In\naffirming, the Second Circuit stated that repeated examples of delayed or denied medical treatment bespeaks\ndeliberate indifference by prison officials to the medical needs of the inmates. Todaro, 565 F.2d at 52. However,\nclaims of medical malpractice or negligence on the part of the prison doctor, Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106,\n97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); Corby v. Conboy, 457 F.2d 251, 254 (2d Cir.1972), disagreement with\nthe doctor's professional judgment about proper treatment, Hyde v. McGinnis, 429 F.2d 864, 866-67 (2d\nCir.1970), and accidents, Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105, 97 S.Ct. at 291, do not rise to the level of deliberate\nindifference.\nTurning to the second prong of the Eighth Amendment standard, a prisoner must show that the medical needs to\nwhich prison officials were deliberately indifferent were serious. In Todaro, Judge Ward ruled that a serious\nmedical need can be one which \"although not life threatening or likely to result in permanent disability, cause[s]\ndiscomfort.\" 431 F.Supp. at 1132-33. In affirming, the Second Circuit found that medical conditions which cause\nor perpetuate pain constitute serious medical needs. Todaro v. Ward, 565 F.2d 48, 52 (2d Cir.1977).\nFinally, since plaintiffs challenge as unconstitutional the system for the delivery of dental services at Bedford Hills\nand not merely the dental care provided to one inmate, they must prove \"a pattern of conduct amounting to\ndeliberate indifference to [dental] needs of prisoners.\" Bishop v. Stoneman, 508 F.2d 1224, 1226 (2d Cir. 1974).\nThey may prove such a pattern by demonstrating a series of incidents of deliberate indifference closely related in\ntime to one another. Id. In Todaro v. Ward, the Second Circuit spoke of \"repeated examples\" of inadequate\nmedical treatment as bespeaking systemwide deliberate indifference. 565 F.2d 48, 52 (2d Cir.1977).\nThus, to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on their claim that the provision of dental services at\n402 Bedford Hills is unconstitutional, plaintiffs must make a strong showing that defendants *402 denied inmates\naccess to the dentist for diagnosis and treatment or failed to provide prescribed treatment, resulting in pain,\ndiscomfort, or damage to the health of prison inmates. They also must show that incidents of failure to care for\nserious needs were not isolated events, but were part of a pattern of inadequate dental care.\n\nB. Eighth Amendment Standard Applied to Bedford Hills\n1. Deliberate Indifference\nThe evidence adduced at the hearing satisfies the Court that there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will\nsucceed in showing that defendants are deliberately indifferent to inmates' dental needs. Plaintiffs proved many\nincidents of delay in or denial of access to the dentist as well as numerous occasions in which prescribed\ntreatment was not given. Two inmates, for example, have never seen the dentist, although they have often\nrequested treatment. Numerous inmates have waited a year or more for their requests to see the dentist fulfilled.\nAnd still others have been diagnosed but have waited six months or more for treatment. Each of these delays\nrepresents an instance of deliberate indifference to inmates' dental needs.\nThe defendants argue that although they knew about the inmates' dental needs, they are not deliberately\nindifferent to them because they do provide treatment to inmates, they have made and are making efforts to\nimprove care at Bedford Hills, and they currently plan to expand the dental facilities at Bedford Hills. In essence,\nthey argue that their good faith in dealing with the provision of dental care at Bedford Hills precludes a finding of\ndeliberate indifference. The relevant case law does not support defendants' position. Deliberate indifference can\nbe proved by showing a prison official's mental state. But deliberate indifference is also a standard for measuring\nthe adequacy of prison officials' responses to the known medical needs of inmates and their system for allowing\ninmates to make their needs known. While intentional or reckless denial of treatment may constitute deliberate\nindifference, denial of treatment regardless of mental state can also constitute deliberate indifference. When\nprison officials are aware of inmates' dental needs they must not deny 00 intentionally or otherwise 00 care to them.\n97 97\nThis is established in the various formulations of the delibrate indifference standard. Judge Weinfeld, for\nexample, stated that deliberate indifference can be shown by intentional efforts to delay access to treatment,\ncomplete denial of treatment, or reckless or callous indifference to the safety of prisoners. Harding v. Kuhlmann,\n588 F.Supp. 1315, 1316 (S.D.N.Y.1984),aff'd,762 F.2d 990 (2d Cir.1985). Judge Ward, in summarizing the law of\ndeliberate indifference, stated \"to prove a .... claim of unconstitutional denial of medical care it is necessary to\nshow either denied or unreasonably delayed access to a physician for diagnosis or treatment of a discomfort\ncausing ailment, or failure to provide prescribed treatment.\" Todaro v. Ward, 431 F.Supp. 1129, 1133\n(S.D.N.Y.1977),aff'd,565 F.2d 48 (2d Cir.1977).\nThe defendants next argue that the delays in providing care are not unconstitutional. They rely on Chapman v.\nRhodes, 434 F.Supp. 1007 (S.D.Ohio 1977),aff'd,624 F.2d 1099 (6th Cir.1980),rev., 452 U.S. 337, 101 S.Ct.\n2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), in which the lower court found that substantial backlogs in the provision of dental\nservices 00 including delays in pulling teeth, providing dentures, and filling cavities 00 developed before a full-time\n97 97\ndentist was hired and one year later after he left. The court stated that the delays were intolerable, but found that\nthey were only temporary, and the evidence before the court showed all dental needs were then being met. The\ncourt never actually ruled on the constitutionality of dental services because it was not relevant to the ultimate\nissue in the case 00 the constitutionality of double celling.\n97\nThe Supreme Court, which only dealt with the constitutionality of double celling, mentioned that while a turnover\n403 in dental staff had caused a temporary but substantial *403 backlog, the evidence showed that the dental staff\nwas treating emergencies. Chapman, 452 U.S. at 342, n. 6, 101 S.Ct. at 2397 n. 6. The evidence indicates that\nthe dental staff at Bedford Hills does not treat emergencies and that the backlog is not temporary. Moreover, \nChapman does not stand for the proposition that substantial delays in the provision of dental care are not\nunconstitutional. Furthermore, the consideration of dental care was dicta in both the district court and the\nSupreme Court, as the real issue was double celling. And if any guidelines emerge from Chapman, they are that\ntemporary delays are not unconstitutional, as long as a dental clinic is presently providing dental care, and that a\nprison should not be subject to injunctive relief for past problems in the provision of dental services.\nIn the present case, although the backlogs developed near the end of Dr. Collings' tenure and became greater in\nthe gap between Dr. Collings' exodus and Dr. Sherman's arrival, the backlogs at Bedford Hills continue and have\ngrown. Dr. Sherman admitted that he is three months behind in treating requests for emergency treatment, and\n\nas the record indicates, patients who signed up for treatment with Dr. Sherman are still waiting to see him for\ndiagnosis or treatment.\nDefendants attempt to rely on other cases that deal directly with delays in the provision of dental services. In \nRobbins v. South, 595 F.Supp. 785 (D.Mont.1984), plaintiff alleged that prison officials ignored plaintiff's written\nrequests for treatment for his infected gums and missing upper dental plate for three months before treating him.\nFinding no allegations that the treatment was intentionally delayed, the court ruled that a three month delay in the\nprovision of treatment does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\nThis, however is not the law in this Circuit, which requires a finding of deliberate indifference if an inmate who has\nmade his needs known to prison officials waits for three months, with a serious dental need and in pain, for dental\ntreatment. In Williams v. Scully, 552 F.Supp. 431 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), for example, the court found that plaintiff stated\na claim for relief by claiming that he lost a filling in one of his teeth, waited over five months for the tooth to be\nrefilled, suffered through a painful infection that developed in the tooth, and eventually lost it. Id. at 432. Robbins\nis also distinguished from the instant case, as three months at Bedford Hills is actually a relatively short waiting\nperiod. Indeed, inmates at Bedford Hills often wait for over a year before seeing a dentist, and even longer before\nreceiving treatment.\nThe defendants also claim that because many patients eventually see the dentist and eventually receive\ntreatment, there is no deliberate indifference. A number of courts have found that visits to the doctor preclude a\nfinding of deliberate indifference. In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), where\nplaintiff claimed that the prison officials violated his Eighth Amendment right to medical attention, the Supreme\nCourt held that plaintiff failed to state a claim of deliberate indifference since he was seen by the doctor\nseventeen times in three months and was diagnosed and treated during that time. The plaintiff's disagreement\nwas only with the type of treatment given. Id. at 107, 97 S.Ct. at 292.\nSimilarly, in Shaffer v. McWilliams, 570 F.Supp. 1422 (W.D.N.Y.1983), plaintiff had two teeth extracted and sued\nthe prison dentist because he refused to prescribe a painkiller stronger than liquid Tylenol. The plaintiff was seen\nfor treatment of her pain eight times in three days. The court, while stating that medical attention of that frequency\nis not consistent with a finding of deliberate indifference, also held that the case only involved a prisoner's\ndisagreement with her doctor's treatment, and such a disagreement did not constitute a constitutional violation. In\nboth Shaffer and Williams, the courts indicated that patients visited the dentist and actually received treatment.\n404 Even if prison officials give inmates access to treatment, they may still be deliberately indifferent to inmates' *404\nneeds if they fail to provide prescribed treatment. Todaro v. Ward, 431 F.Supp. at 1132-33. The record indicates\nthat even when inmates have access to the dentist at Bedford Hills they often do not receive treatment.\n2. Serious Dental Needs\nThe Court finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on their claim that the\ndental needs to which the defendants are deliberately indifferent are serious, except insofar as they relate to\nprophylactic care. The record indicates that inmates do not suffer pain as a direct result of failure to provide\nprophylactic care and that failure to give prophylactic care to teeth will rarely lead to serious problems, although\nperiodontal disease might develop. This conclusion is contrary to Barnes v. Virgin Islands, 415 F.Supp. 1218\n(D.V.I.1976), where the Court stated that prisoners are entitled to curative and preventive dental work. Id. at\n1235. But a prisoner is entitled to treatment only for conditions that cause pain, discomfort, or threat to good\nhealth, not treatment to ward off such conditions. Although preventive dentistry would probably save the clinic\ntime in the long run, the Constitution does not require wise dentistry, only dentistry which responds to inmates'\npain and discomfort.\nInmates' other dental needs 00 for fillings, crowns, and the like 00 are serious medical needs as the law defines\n97 97\nthat term. Inmates needing these services testified that they suffered from pain and discomfort. In addition to\npain, many inmates suffered serious health consequences as a result of the defendants' failure to treat them.\nOne inmate, for example, lost a tooth that could have been saved with prompt attention, and another lost fifteen\npounds while awaiting dentures. The record indicates that while inmates with serious medical needs often\nrequested treatment they did not receive it.\n\n3. Institutional Violation\nFinally, the Court finds that there is a substantial likelihood that deliberate indifference to inmates' serious dental\nneeds at Bedford Hills is systemwide. In Bishop v. Stoneman, 508 F.2d 1224 (2d Cir.1974), the Court found that\nsix incidents of delay or denial of medical treatment was sufficient to state a claim for systemwide relief. Id.\n1225-26. Plaintiffs here have shown many more than six instances of inadequate care. And more importantly,\nthey have demonstrated that the cases of inadequate care are directly linked to defendants' policy of ignoring\ninmates' requests for routine care, waiting for months before responding to requests for emergency care, and\nrarely keeping follow-up appointments. Their failure to respond to requests for emergency treatment and routine\ncare, and to perform follow-up appointments denies the defendants access to the dentist for treatment and\ndiagnosis, and thus constitutes deliberate indifference on an institutional scale.\nHowever, the defendants' failure to do prompt initial examinations does not, in and of itself, rise to the level of a\nconstitutional violation. The Eighth Amendment does not entitle inmates to an initial screening. The deliberate\nindifference standard does not require prison officials to seek out patients for treatment. The prison must provide\ninmates with a procedure for making their needs known and must provide services to inmates who need them,\nbut the burden is on the prisoner to make the needs known. For example, in Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F.2d 449\n(2d Cir.1969), the court stated that a complaint which alleged only that a prison attendant observed that the\nplaintiff looked ill, but did not allege that the defendants knew he was ill or that he required treatment, did not\nstate a violation. Although this case was decided before Estelle, more recent formulations of the deliberate\nindifference standard indicate that prison officials cannot be liable unless they knew of an inmate's medical needs\nor had some reason to believe they might be serious. See Harding v. Kuhlmann, 588 F.Supp. 1315\n405 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (deliberate indifference can be shown by intentional efforts to delay access, complete *405 denial\nof treatment, or reckless or callous indifference to the safety of the prisoner); Williams v. Director of Health\nServices, 542 F.Supp. 883 (S.D.N.Y.1982) (deliberate and callous disregard for inmate's request for treatment).\nAlthough the failure to conduct prompt initial screening examinations may be inefficient prison administration, it is\nnot unconstitutional. See Chapman v. Rhodes, 434 F.Supp. 1007, 1016 (S.D.Ohio 1977),aff'd,624 F.2d 1099\n(6th Cir.1980),rev. in other part, 452 U.S. 337, 344, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2398, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (failure of dental\nclinic to formulate individual treatment plans for dental patients is not unconstitutional).\nII. Irreparable Harm\nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must also show irreparable harm. Plaintiffs in this case have made such\na showing. Inmates at Bedford Hills are suffering from pain, loss of teeth, discomfort, weight loss, and infection.\nAll are forms of irreparable harm. See Lee v. McManus, 543 F.Supp. 386, 392 (D.Kan.1982) (pain, anxiety,\ndiscomfort, and life-threatening complications are the type of irreparable harm which can justify a preliminary\ninjunction). The defendant's remedial efforts have not defeated or remedied the irreparable harm.\nREMEDY\nBased on the above findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court must issue a preliminary injunction ordering\nthe defendants to provide adequate dental care to inmates with serious dental needs. Specifically, the defendants\nare hereby ORDERED to provide a dental access system that assures prompt diagnosis and treatment for\ninmates with serious dental needs, provide a system that assures that follow-up care is provided as ordered and\nwithout delay, and take prompt steps to eliminate expeditiously the current backlogs in treatment. Defendants are\nfurthermore ORDERED to take all steps necessary to comply with the terms of this order.\nThe Court will not now be more specific regarding the terms of the injunction. It expects the defendant and\nplaintiffs to work out terms for compliance with the injunction in the first instance.\nSO ORDERED.\n\n[1] In the original complaint, Thomas Collings was named as a defendant in his capacity as dentist at Bedford\nHills. Dr. Collings has since left Bedford Hills, and his replacement, Dr. Sherman, has been substituted as a\ndefendant. Dr. Sherman testified extensively at the hearings. The Court finds, based on its direct observation of\nthe witness and consideration of all the other evidence adduced at the hearing, that Dr. Sherman was for the\nmost part not credible and his answers were generally evasive and incomplete.\n[2] There was some dispute as to the effect of these guidelines. Defense witnesses maintained that they set forth\ngoals and aspirations for prison dental facilities, while plaintiffs often used them as a standard against which to\nmeasure defendants' performance. Without attempting to resolve that conflict, the Court notes that it is referring\nto the guidelines for descriptive purposes only, and not as a means for judging the adequacy of care at Bedford\nHills. The Eighth Amendment, and not these guidelines, is the Court's sole standard.\n[3] Gonzalez was transferred to Albion Correctional Facility in December, 1984. This does not mitigate the failure\nto treat her in the five months between the diagnosis and transfer.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

TREATMENT PRIORITIES.\nAll  patients  examined  in  the  Bedford  Hills  dent;\nclinic, other than those who are not in need of treatment, shal'\nin  accordance  with  the  professional  judgment  of  the  examinij\ndentist, be classified  for treatment  priorities  as set  forth :\nParagraphs A, B, and C of Appendix  A to this Stipulation, whic\nis incorporated herein.\nII.  ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE AND FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT.\nA.  DENTAL EMERGENCIES.\n1.  Each  patient  requesting  emergency  dent*\nassistance  shall  be  evaluated  on  the  day  of  her  request.  l\npatient  shall be evaluated without physical examination  unless\nhealth care provider speaks with the patient and determines th*\nthe  complaint  is not  of  an  emergent  nature.  In such  cases, c\nentry  shall  be  made  in  the  dental  chart  by  the  health  cai\nprovider setting forth the reason the complaint is determined nc\nto  be  an  emergency.

Pending  th\nprovision of such treatment by an outside provider, the patier\nshall be seen by the Bedford  Hills dental clinic on a regulf\nbasis  for  palliative  treatment  to  stabilize  the  patient'\ncondition and control pain or infection.\n6.  Those patients  found  not to be suffering  from\ndental emergency may be referred to dental sick call.\nB.  DENTAL  SICK  CALL.  Defendants  shall  provide  al\ninmates  an opportunity  to  request  dental  sick  call  in writir\neach day.  An inmate whose sick call request indicates the nee\nfor emergency dental assistance shall be evaluated, examined an\n-4-\n\ntreated  in accordance with paragraph  II-A of this Stipulatior\nny other inmate who requests dental sick call shall be examine\nwithin one week of her request.  Treatment shall begin within or\nweek  after examination  for a Class  3 patient and within eigr\nweeks  after  examination  for  a  Class  2 patient.  Each  patier\nshall be informed of her treatment plan and its priority at tr\ntime of her examination or, if not possible at that time, as soc\nas possible thereafter.\nC.  FOLLOW-UP CARE.\n1.  Whenever  a  dentist  determines  that  a  patier\nrequires  a  return  visit  to  the  dental  clinic  for  follow-i:\ntreatment or evaluation, the dentist  shall exercise his or he\nbest professional judgment as to when the patient should be see\nagain and shall enter such order on the patient's dental chart\nThe patient shall be given a follow-up appointment in accordanc\nwith the dentist's order, and completion of the treatment shaJ\nnot be unduly  prolonged.  When  the dentist does not  specify\ntime for the patient's next visit after treatment has begun,\nrecall appointment shall be given as follows:\na.  Within the next ten working days for a Class 3\npatient;\nb.  Within the next twenty working days for a Class 2\npatient; and\nc.  Within seven working days after the return of\nprosthetic work from an outside laboratory\nfor a patient receiving prosthetic treatment.\n2.  For  a  patient  who  has  a  Class  3  or  Class\ncondition  that  requires  treatment  by  an  outside  provider\ndefendants  shall  exercise  their  best  efforts  to  have  sue\n-5-\n\ntreatment  provided  within  the  timelines  set  forth  in  Paragrap\nII-C-1 of this Stipulation, but in any event such treatment  shal\nbe provided within  twenty working  days  for Class  3 patients  an\nwithin  sixty  working  days  for  Class  2  patients.  Pending  th\nprovision  of  such  treatment  by  an outside provider, the patien\nshall  be  seen  by  the  Bedford  Hills  dental  clinic  on  a  regula\nbasis  for  palliative  treatment  to  stabilize  the  patient'\ncondition and control pain or infection.\n3.  A patient who has been examined  or treated  in th\ndental clinic and who requires follow-up care or evaluation  shal\nbe  informed  orally  at  the  time  of  such  determination  of  th\napproximate  date  and  time  of  her  next  appointment.  At  leas\nforty-eight  hours  before  the  appointment  is scheduled  to occur\nthe patient  shall be advised  in writing  of the date and time o\nher next appointment.  A patient whose appointment does not occu\non  the  day  it  was  scheduled  shall  be  given  a  new  appointmer\nunless  she  has  informed  the  dental  clinic  in writing  that  st\nwishes to discontinue  treatment.\n4.  No  patient  scheduled  to  be  seen  in  the  dente\nclinic shall be deemed to have refused treatment unless she, or\nfacility  staff  member  witnessing  her  refusal,  so  states  i\nwriting.  A patient who  refuses  treatment  three  (3) consecuti\"\\\ntimes shall be deemed to have discontinued treatment.\nD.  PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT OF THE DENTIST.\nWhenever,  in  the  professional  opinion  of  the  treatii\ndentist,  commencement  or  continuation  of  treatment  for\nparticular  patient  within  the  deadlines  imposed  by  th:\n-6-\n\nStipulation  is contrary to sound medical  judgment, the dentist\nopinion shall control.  In such cases, the dentist shall enter\nthat  patient's  dental  chart  the  reasons  why  adherence  to  tho\ndeadlines for that patient is contrary to sound medical judgmen\nIII.

Coughlin\nPC-NY-003-002\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nMARY DEAN, et aJL. ,\nPlaintiffs, REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n- against - 84 civ. 1528  (SWK)\nTHOMAS A. COUGHLIN, III, et ai.,\nDefendants.\nTO THE HONORABLE SHIRLEY WOHL KRAM, U.S.D.J.:\nThis class action was brought, pursuant to 4 2 U.S.C. §\n1983,  by  inmates  at  the  Bedford  Hills  Correctional  Facility\nchallenging, the dental care provided there as  violative of their\nrights  under  the Eighth Amendment.  It was referred  to me on\nApril 25, 1986.  The action has now been settled and this report\nrecommends approval of the settlement.\nThe  complaint  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive\nrelief.1  The  facts  of  this  case  are  set  out  in  detail  in\nopinions  by  the  district  court,  623  F.Supp.  392  (1985),  633\nF.Supp.  302  (1986),  and by the Court of Appeals, 804 F.2d  207\n(1986).  Since familiarity with those opinions  is assumed, the\nfacts need not be repeated here.  Suffice it to say, a hearing\nwas held on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and,\nin a decision dated December 3, 1985, see 623 F.Supp. 392, the\n•'•The complaint  also  sought  damages  on behalf  of  the  four\nnamed  plaintiffs.  This  report  does  not  concern  the  damages\naspect of the case.\n\ndistrict  court  found  that  plaintiffs  had  satisfied  the\nrequirements for a mandatory preliminary injunction.\nIn that decision, Judge Kram found a total breakdown in\nthe administration of the dental clinic at Bedford Hills.  See\n623 F.2d at 396.  She noted the failure to perform initial exams,\nthe  collapse  of  the  system  for  requesting  routine  care,  the\nbacklog in emergency requests, and the failure to Uceep follow-up\nappointments.  Xd.  Accordingly, Judge Kram ordered defendants\nto  provide  a  dental  access  system  that\nassures  prompt  diagnosis  and  treatment  for\ninmates with serious dental needs, provide a\nsystem  that  assures  that  follow-up  care is\nprovided  as  ordered  and  without  delay, and\ntake prompt steps to eliminate expeditiously\nthe current backlogs in treatment.\n623 F.Supp. at 405.\nThe settlement provides  for the entry of a permanent\ninjunction covering all the areas identified by Judge Kram in her\nDecember  1985  opinion  as being  inadequate, and  other areas as\nwell.\nThe settlement establishes three classes of treatment\npriorities: emergency treatment, essential treatment and routine\ntreatment.  Patients  requesting  emergency  treatment  will  be\nevaluated  on  the  day  of  their request.  Any  other  inmate who\nrequests dental sick call will be examined within one week of her\nrequest.  Treatment  will  be  .given  within  one  week  after\nexamination for those patients in need of essential treatment and\nwithin eight weeks for those in need of routine treatment.\n\nThe settlement requires that follow-up care be provided\nas the dentist  orders.  It also requires that treatment not be\nunduly prolonged.  In fact, when the dentist does not specify a\ntime for a follow-up visit, one will automatically be set.\nThe  settlement  also  requires  the  state  to  maintain\nadequate staff, facilities and equipment to fulfill the terms of\nthe settlement.  In this regard, the state must maintain proper\ndental charts, medical histories, dental x-rays, treatment plans,\nand records of treatment.  In addition, the state will provide\nevery  inmate  arriving  at  Bedford  Hills,  as  part  of  her\norientation,  with  written  materials  describing  the  dental\npriority  system,  her  rights  of  access  to  dental  care  and\nfollow-up  treatment,-  and  the  availability  of  a  grievance  and\nconciliation mechanism for resolution of problems and complaints\nabout dental care.  These materials will be provided in Spanish,\ntoo.\nThe  state  must  also  maintain  records  for meaningful\nauditing of their compliance with the stipulation of settlement.\nFurther, the state shall submit periodic reports to plaintiffs'\ncounsel,  at  first  every  month,  and  later  on  a  less  frequent\nbasis.  In addition, plaintiffs' counsel has the right to inspect\nall dental  care areas  and to  review  all  records and documents\nmaintained by the dental clinic.\nIn the event of disputes, a conciliation mechanism  is\nprovided.  if  that mechanism  cannot resolve  the dispute, then\nplaintiffs may seek relief from the court.  six years after the\n\nsettlement  is \"so ordered,\"  provided  there  is compliance, the\nrequirements of this stipulation will cease to bind the state.\nNevertheless, the state must continue to provide a dental access\nsystem  that  assures  prompt  diagnosis  and treatment  of  inmates\nwith  serious  dental  needs, as well  as a  system  that  assures\nprompt follow-up. In other words, the December 1985 preliminary\ninjunction becomes a permanent injunction.  \\\nPursuant to this court's order, filed March 27, 1987,\nthe class received notice of the settlement.  Although the order\nprovided for notice by certain means, counsel for defendants has\nindicated  that,  in  addition,  notices  were  distributed  to all\ninmates  in their  cells.2  See Transcript  of Hearing  on Class\nAction Settlement  (\"Hearing\") at 10.  With respect to the named\nplaintiffs, plaintiffs' counsel has indicated that they spoke to\neach  of  them  and  that  they  all  concur  in  entry  of  the\nstipulation.  As for the class, plaintiffs' counsel toured the\ninstitution  on  April  23  and April  27, 1987, and  spoke  with\ninmates  concerning  the  settlement.  Hearing  at 9-10.  These\ninmates raised two issues.  The first dealt with the departure\nfrom Bedford Hills of the Mobile Dental Services, an independent\ncontractor brought in by the state to provide dental care after\nthe  December  3, 1985, opinion.  The state has elected  not to\nrenew  the  one  year  contract,  but  intends  to  replace  these\npersonnel with civil service employees.\n2A hearing on the settlement was held on May 5, 1987\n\nAt  the  hearing,  plaintiffs'  counsel  submitted  a\npetition signed by 285 inmates, expressing their unhappiness with\nthe departure of the Mobile Dental Services Unit.3  Although this\nsentiment appears widespread, the class still does not oppose the\nsettlement.  Hearing at 16-17.\nThe  second  issued  raised  concerned  the  treatment  of\npatients with AIDS or AIDS Related Complex (\"ARC\")-..  Plaintiffs'\ncounsel met with an inmate who had written to me, expressing her\nconcern  for  this  problem.  Counsel  for  plaintiffs  feel  the\nfailure  to  treat  patients  with  AIDS  or  ARC  is  a  legitimate\ncomplaint.  Nonetheless,  the  state  at  present  plans  to  treat\npatients diagnosed as having AIDS or ARC, and is doing so how.-4\nWhat is more, it appears that language in the stipulation covers\npatients with those diseases.5\nIn  sum,  no  member  of  the  class  has  opposed  the\nsettlement.  Indeed,  there  is no  reason  for  opposition.  The\nsettlement  is  fair  and reasonable.  As counsel  for plaintiffs\n3A  letter from an individual class member, also expressing\ndisappointment with the failure to renew the contract of Mobile\nDental Services, was submitted at the hearing as well.\n4The  state pointed out at the hearing, however, that some\ncases may  be so advanced that no treatment  could be rendered.\nHearing at 20.\n5The inmate who wrote to me at first wanted to appear at the\nhearing.  she then called plaintiffs' counsel to advise him that\nshe no longer wished to attend, as some of her friends, on whose\nbehalf she had expressed concern, had been called to the dental\nclinic.  Hearing at 23.\n\nsaid at the hearing, \"[w]e believe that plaintiffs have achieved\nthrough  the  consent  decree  the  relief  they  sought  from  the\ncourt.\"  Hearing at 9.  Consequently, it is recommended that the\nsettlement be approved.\nCopies of this report have been mailed this date to all\nparties  listed below, who are hereby  advised of their right to\nfile objections to this report on or before June >9, 1987.
