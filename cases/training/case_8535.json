We do not have a copy of the complaint; therefore the exact allegations involved are unknown.  Following some discovery, unsuccessful mediation, and a successful motion for summary judgment by the defendant regarding its policy requiring English to be spoken to customers unless requested otherwise, the parties settled the lawsuit in September 2007 through a consent decree.  We do not have a copy of the decree.  Therefore, the exact allegations involved are unknown.  However, it appears from the docket that the defendant was required to pay $565,000.</p><p></p>",

New York. \nSeptember 13, 2005. \n409*409 Raechel L. Adams, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, New York City, \nfor Plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \nEugene M. Bellin, New York City, for Plaintiffs-Intervenors. \nJoseph Baumgarten, Proskauer Rose LLP, New York City, for Defendants Sephora USA, \nGjonbalaj, Saini, and Tran. \nMiriam Lieberson, Jackson, Lewis, LLP, New York City, for Defendant Frank Cimitile. \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nBUCHWALD, District Judge. \nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") initiated this action in November \n2003, alleging that defendant Sephora USA, LLC (\"Sephora\") discriminated against five \nformer employees and a potential class of Hispanic employees by, inter alia, maintaining an \n\"English-only\" rule in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § \n2000e, et seq. In March 2004, plaintiffs-intervenors[1] filed a complaint joining the action and \nnaming several former and current Sephora employees as defendants.[2] While 410*410 the \n\ncircumstances concerning the separation of the individual plaintiffs differ, none were fired \nfor violating an \"English-only\" policy. \nSephora and three of the individual defendants, Saini, Gjonbalaj, and Tran, now move for \npartial summary judgment on the issue of whether the policy on the use of English Sephora \noutlined in a memorandum to store managers constitutes an unlawful English-only rule. For \nthe following reasons, we grant defendants' motion. \nBACKGROUND[3] \nSephora operates retail cosmetics stores throughout the United States. During the relevant \ntimes discussed herein, Sephora operated stores in the New York Metropolitan area. Each \nSephora store is managed by a store director, who reports to a regional manager. Stores \nemploy assistant managers and first-level supervisors.[4] Within a store, sales personnel, \nreferred to as \"consultants,\" may be assigned to different departments.[5] Sephora refers to \nthe sales floor staff as the \"cast\" and the sales floor as the \"stage.\" In addition to sales \nemployees, Sephora stores employ maintenance and stock department employees, \nreferred to as \"quality\" employees. \nThis case centers on Sephora's store in Rockefeller Center, which opened in late 1999 and \nclosed in August 2002. The plaintiffs-intervenors are all former employees of Sephora who \nworked in the Rockefeller Center store as either consultants or cashiers. The plaintiffs-\nintervenors are all bilingual in Spanish and English. The individual defendants worked at \nvarious times as managers in the Rockefeller Center store and at other New York area \nstores. \nIn or about August 2002, the plaintiffs-intervenors filed charges with the Equal Opportunity \nEmployment Commission (\"EEOC\"), complaining of an allegedly discriminatory English-only \nrule, as well as alleging that defendants discriminated against them on the basis of their \nnational origin. \nDuring the times relevant to this case, Linda Skinner has been Director of Sephora's Human \nResources department. Skinner conducts conference calls with store directors and \nspecialists in Sephora's U.S. stores approximately six to eight times a year to address \nhuman resources issues relevant to Sephora's operations (referred to as \"HR Conference \nCalls\").[6] In September 2002 Skinner conducted an HR Conference Call in which she \naddressed Sephora's expectations with respect to English in the workplace. Skinner \nfollowed up on the conference call by distributing a memorandum (the \"All About HR \n\nRecap\" or \"Recap\"), although plaintiffs dispute that all managers in the New York region \nsaw the memorandum. \n411*411 The relevant section of the Recap is as follows: \n6. English in the Workplace \n• Sephora does not have, and has never had, an \"English-only\" policy. \n• Generally, cast members may speak whatever language they choose. \n• However, Sephora expects cast members who are on stage during business hours to \nspeak English whenever clients are present. \n• Of course, cast members are encouraged to communicate with clients in other languages, \nif the client wishes to do so. \n• Before opening and after closing, as well as times when no clients are in the store, cast \nmembers are free to speak any language they choose. \n• Cast members may speak any language they choose when off stage—for example, in a \nbreak room or office. \n• Cast members may speak any language they choose when not on Sephora time—on a \nbreak or after a shift. \n• Cast members may be asked to speak English in other situations if there is a business \nneed—for example, where safety is an issue (when working on a ladder, changing out \nshelving, retrofits, etc.) \n• While Sephora encourages the spirit of teamwork amongst all cast members, it does not \nexpect cast members to speak English except in the limited circumstances described \nabove. \nDeclaration of Joseph Baumgarten (\"Baumgarten Decl.\"), Ex. E. \nAccording to Sephora, each of the plaintiffs-intervenors is fluent in English and capable of \ncomplying with Sephora's expectations concerning speaking English while on stage. Defs. \n56.1 Stmt. ¶ 18. It is undisputed that Sephora encourages bilingual cast members to speak \nin a foreign language (including Spanish) to a customer who prefers to speak in that \nlanguage, and that the plaintiffs-intervenors were sometimes called upon to translate for \ncustomers who did not speak English. While plaintiffs do not directly contradict Sephora's \ncharacterization of plaintiffs-intervenors' English as fluent, they allege that some of the \nplaintiffs-intervenors \"experience difficulty expressing themselves in English,\" and therefore \n\n\"spoke Spanish at work when they were unable to express themselves in English.\" Pls. 56.1 \nStmt. ¶ 19, Id. at 5. Plaintiffs further assert that \"[a]s a result of a phenomenon known as \ncode-switching—an unconscious tendency to begin to speak in Spanish, to respond in \nSpanish when addressed in that language, and to continue speaking in Spanish with native \nSpanish-speakers like themselves the Plaintiffs-Intervenors were not `capable of complying' \nwith Sephora's `expectations.' \" Pls. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 18. Plaintiffs further suggest that \n\"[b]ecause [the plaintiffs-intervenors] code-switch as a matter of involuntary habit, they are \ntriggered to speak Spanish not as a matter of `personal preference and convenience' but as \na matter of necessity.\" Pl 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 19. Plaintiffs also allege that the plaintiffs-intervenors \nwere disciplined for speaking Spanish in the workplace, including in the break room and \nduring their lunch hour, and for other instances of speaking Spanish that were clearly \npermissible under the policy outlined in the Recap. In addition to complaints about being \ndisciplined for speaking Spanish in circumstances that would be clearly permissible under \nthe policy outlined in the Recap and complaints about other discrimination on the basis of \nnational origin, plaintiffs also argue that the policy embodied in the Recap violates Title VII. \n412*412 Defendants moved for summary judgment in the hope of narrowing the issues in \nthe case. Sephora maintains that the English-speaking policy it outlined in the Recap does \nnot violate Title VII and moves for summary judgment on that issue.[7] For the following \nreasons, we agree with Sephora, and grant summary judgment on that issue. \nAt the outset it should be clear that the motion and our decision are limited to the legality of \nthe policy as set out in the Recap. Therefore, we will not address whether the Recap \ncreated a new policy, Pls. 56.1 Stmt 2 ¶ 5; whether Sephora, or individual Sephora \nmanagers, applied more restrictive standards to when languages other than English could \nbe spoken beyond those outlined in the Recap, or engaged in other discriminatory conduct, \nOpp. Mem. at 4; whether Sephora informed all the store managers and HR managers of the \npolicy embodied in the Recap, Opp. Mem at 5; whether Sephora clearly communicated the \npolicy to employees, Pls. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 18, Opp. Mem. at 5; whether the policy remains in \neffect, Defs. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 15; or whether expectations expressed in employee training \nconflict with the policy. Pls. 56.1 Stmt. 16. In their opposition papers, plaintiffs argue that the \nactual application of the policy varied from the policy described in the Recap, and that there \ntherefore \"genuine issue[s] of material fact with regard to when and where Sephora's \nEnglish-only rule applies to employees.\" Opp. Mem. at 8. Thus at present, we are \nevaluating the written and official policy of Sephora as such, leaving to another day issues \nof whether it has been followed or breached in specific instances. \nDISCUSSION \n\nI. Summary Judgment Standard \nSummary judgment is properly granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is \nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandate the \nentry of summary judgment \"against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to \nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party \nwill bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, \n91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In reviewing the record, we must assess \"the evidence in the light \nmost favorable to the party opposing the motion, and resolve ambiguities and draw \nreasonable inferences against the moving party.\" Frito-Lay, Inc. v. LTV Steel Co. (In re \nChateaugay Corp.), 10 F.3d 944, 957 (2d Cir.1993). \nIn order to defeat such a motion, the nonmoving party must affirmatively set forth facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,477 U.S. 242, \n256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). An issue is \"genuine . \" . if the evidence is \nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. at 248, 106 \nS.Ct. 2505 (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, when deciding a motion for \nsummary judgment, a district court 413*413 may only consider evidence that would be \nadmissible at trial. See Nora Beverages v. Perrier Group of America, Inc., 269 F.3d 114, \n123 (2d Cir.2001). \nII. Disparate Impact Under Title VII \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it is unlawful for an employer: \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of \nemployment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or \n(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way \nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or \notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, \ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin. \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). To this end, the Act provides that plaintiffs can prevail on a \n\"disparate impact\" theory of discrimination, under which an employer can be found liable for \ndiscrimination for a policy that, although neutral on its face, acts to discriminate against the \nmembers of a protected class. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1).[8]A complaining party can \n\nestablish an unlawful employment practice under a disparate impact approach by \ndemonstrating that \"a respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a \ndisparate impact on the basis of . . . national origin and the respondent fails to demonstrate \nthat the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with \nbusiness necessity,\" or by establishing the availability of an \"alternative employment \npractice\" and that the respondent refuses to adopt. Id. \nWe analyze a disparate impact claim with a three-stage burden-shifting \nframework.See Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 160-61 (2d \nCir.2001). In the first stage, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of disparate \nimpact, which \"requires plaintiff[ to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the \nemployer `uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.'\" Id. at 160 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(A)(I)). To make this prima facie showing of disparate impact, a plaintiff must \"(1) \nidentify a policy or practice, (2) demonstrate that a disparity exists, and (3) establish a \ncausal relationship between the two.\" Id.(citations omitted). \nAt the second stage, the employer must challenge plaintiffs' proof of disparate impact and, \nfailing that, the employer must \"demonstrate that the challenged practice or policy is `job \nrelated for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.'\" Robinson, 267 \nF.3d at 161 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(I)). \nIf the employer succeeds in establishing a business justification, \"the disparate impact claim \nproceeds to a third stage. At this third stage, the burden of persuasion shifts back to the \nplaintiffs to establish the availability of an alternative policy or practice that would also \nsatisfy the asserted 414*414 business necessity, but would do so without producing the \ndisparate effect.\" Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii), (C); \nother citations omitted). \n1. Plaintiffs Have Presumptively Established a Prima Facie Case of Disparate Impact \nWe begin our discussion by referencing the relevant EEOC guideline which provides that \n\"[a]n employer may have a rule requiring that employees speak only in English at certain \ntimes where the employer can show that the rule is justified by business necessity.\" 29 \nC.F.R. § 1606.7(b).[9] The \"certain times\" guideline set out in § 1606.7(b) essentially \nassumes that the existence of such a rule satisfies an employee's burden of establishing a \nprima facie showing of disparate impact and advances the inquiry to the second step of the \nburden-shifting framework.[10] We decline to decide whether that aspect of the guidelines is \na proper interpretation of Title VII, and instead follow the example of Fierro v. Saks Fifth \nAvenue, 13 F.Supp.2d 481, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1998) and \"proceed[] directly to the real issues \n\npresented by . . . plaintiff[sl claims, by simply conceding in the abstract the existence of \na prima faciecase.\" See also Roman v. Cornell Univ., 53 F.Supp.2d. 223, 235 \n(N.D.N.Y.1999). We therefore assume, for the purposes of this motion, that plaintiffs have \nsatisfied the first stage of the three-stage burden-shifting framework by making a prima \nfacie showing of disparate impact.[11] \n415*415 2. Defendants Have Demonstrated a Business Necessity \nAs we noted earlier, at the second stage the burden shifts to the defendants to demonstrate \nthat the policy is \"job related for the position in question and consistent with business \nnecessity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(I). Business necessity is also incorporated in the \nEEOC guidelines, which permit a \"certain times\" English rule \"where the employer can show \nthat the rule is justified by business necessity.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1606.7(b). \nCourts have found \"certain times\"-type English-only rules permissible when they are \njustified by a need to stem hostility between bilingual employees speaking a foreign \nlanguage and employees who do not speak that language, as well as when English-\nspeaking supervisors need to understand what is being said in a work area. Roman,53 \nF.Supp.2d. at 237; Kania, 14 F.Supp.2d at 736; Prado v. L. Luria & Son, Inc., 975 F.Supp. \n1349, 1357 (S.D.Fla. 1997); Long, 894 F.Supp. at 941; Gonzalez v. Salvation Army, No. 89-\n1679-CIV-17, 1991 WL 11009376, at *3 (M.D.Fla. June 3, 1991) (aff'd in unpublished \nopinion, 985 F.2d 578 (11th Cir.1993)). Other cases have approved of English-only rules \nsimilar to the Recap policy, but did so by concluding that plaintiffs had failed to make prima \nfacie showings of disparate impact. Spun Steak, 998 F.2d at 1488 (9th \nCir.1993) (concluding that \"a bilingual employee is not denied a privilege of employment by \nthe English-only policy\"); Garcia v. Gloor, 618 F.2d 264, 272 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that \"an \nemployer's rule forbidding a bilingual employee to speak anything but English in public \nareas while on the job is not discrimination based on national origin as applied to a person \nwho is fully capable of speaking English and chooses not to do so in deliberate disregard of \nhis employer's rule.\"). \nWith this legal framework we will address the specific business justifications Sephora has \nproposed in defense of the Recap policy. At the outset of this discussion, we will clarify the \ncontext in which Sephora asserts it can apply the policy set out in the Recap. Sephora \ncreated written job descriptions for the consultant and cashier positions. Declaration of \nRaechel Adams (\"Adams Decl.\"), Exs. 21, 22. The written job descriptions include an ability \nto clearly communicate, which in this context, the midtown Rockefeller Center location, \nrequired English proficiency. Id.We note that, consistent with the printed job descriptions, all \nthe plaintiffs-intervenors can communicate in English. Four of the plaintiffs-intervenors \n\nadmitted that they speak fluent English. Rodriguez Tr. at 33; phasis added); Opp. Mem. at \n15 (\"[U]nder disparate treatment analysis, as well, the facts show that Hispanic employees \nin particular have been targeted by Sephora's English-only rule\"); Opp. Mem. at 21 (arguing \nthat Sephora's business justification is \"nothing more than a pretext for targeting Hispanic \nemployees based on their national origin\" and alleging that Sephora told only Spanish-\nspeaking employees to speak English). \nDisparate impact claims \"involve employment practices which are facially neutral, but fall \nmore harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by some business \nnecessity,\" while a disparate treatment claim \"alleges that the employer treats some people \nless favorably than others because of race\" or on other protected grounds. Hayden v. \nCounty of Nassau, 180 F.3d 42, 52 (2d Cir.1999) (citingInternational Bhd. of Teamsters v. \nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977); St. Mary's \nHonor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)). \"As \npart of a disparate treatment claim, the plaintiff must establish that the employer acted with \nthe intent to discriminate.\" Id.Although plaintiffs have alleged instances of intentional \ndiscrimination by local Sephora managers, they have not alleged any facts to suggest that \nthe promulgation of Sephora's English policy was motivated by discriminatory \nanimus. 416*416 Samboy Tr. at 10; Bernal Tr. at 31; Del Rosario Tr. at 139, 177. Bautista, \nthe fifth plaintiff-intervenor, when asked if she was fluent in English, testified: \"Kind of, I \nwouldn't say completely,\" and explained that she does not know how to say or write \"certain \nwords,\" although she can understand English and make herself understood in English. \nBautista Tr. at 47. Furthermore, all the plaintiffs-intervenors were deposed without \ninterpreters and were able to understand and respond to questions in English. \nPlaintiffs do not assert that it is illegal for Sephora to require proficiency in English as a \ncondition of employability for consultants and cashiers, but rather argue that a business \nnecessity is needed to require those employees to speak English on stage during business \nhours when clients are present. Defendants maintain that speaking English in the presence \nof customers is job related for sales staff and consistent with its business needs of \npoliteness and approachability as components of customer service. Defendants explain that \n\"because client service is the core of Sephora's business, the Company .. expects \nemployees who are hired and trained specifically to serve clients to speak English while on \nthe sales floor out of respect for the client and in order to remain approachable to clients at \nall times,\" and characterize their policy as a \"common sense rule against offending \ncustomers.\" Support Mem. at 8-9, 15 (quoting Rivera v. Baccarat, 10 F.Supp.2d 318, 324 \n(S.D.N.Y.1998)). Skinner and Marie-Christine Marchives, who was Regional Director of the \nManhattan Region, provided the same rationale for the Sephora English language policy. \n\nDeclaration of Joseph Baumgarten (Baum garten Decl.), Exs. F (Skinner Dep.) and H \n(Marchives Dep.). \nPlaintiffs offer a number of rebuttals to defendants' business necessity argument. First, \nplaintiffs argue that \"a dispute of material fact remains\" as to \"various Sephora managers' \nunderstanding of how client service is achieved through an English-only rule.\" Opp. Mem. at \n17. Again we note that the potential for inconsistent views or policy application among \nSephora employees are not material to its legality. \nPlaintiffs also argue that Sephora's asserted business necessity justification is \nimpermissible because \"customer preference is not a valid defense to discrimination against \nemployees.\" Opp. Mem. at 18 (citing Bradley v. Pizzaco of Nebraska, Inc., 7F.3d 795, 799 \n(8th Cir.1993); Gerdom v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 692 F.2d 602, 609 (9th Cir.1982)). \nPlaintiffs' reliance on Bradley and Gerdom is misplaced. Bradleyrejected customers' \npreference for clean-shaven deliverymen as a defense to a requirement that had a \ndisparate impact on African American men, a large percentage of whom cannot shave \nbecause of a skin condition. Gerdom rejected customers' preference for slim female flight \nattendants as a defense to a weight requirement that applied only to women. The courts \nin Bradley and Gerdom,however, rejected those preferences as defenses to discrimination \nbecause the preferences were unrelated to job performance.[12] If a customer preference is \nsufficiently related to job performance then it qualifies as a \"business \nnecessity.\"Gerdom, 692 F.2d at 609 (quoting Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, \nInc., 442 F.2d 385, 389 (5th Cir.1971))(\"customer preference may be taken into account \nonly when it is based on the company's inability 417*417 to perform the primary function or \nservice it offers\"). The requirement that a customer preference relate to job performance \nprevents employers from using customers' intolerance as a business necessity justification \nfor a policy that has a disparate impact on a protected class.Id. Helpfulness, politeness and \napproachability, however, are central to the job of a sales employee at a retail \nestablishment, and are distinct from customers' prejudices. \nWhen salespeople speak in a language customers do not understand, the effects on \nhelpfulness, politeness and approachability are real and are not a matter of abstract \npreference. Furthermore, just as courts have upheld a business necessity for a rule \nmandating that bilingual employees speak English in the workplace to stem hostility \nbetween employees, promoting politeness to customers is a valid business necessity for \nrequiring sales employees to speak English in their presence. SeeRoman, 53 F.Supp.2d. at \n237; Kania, 14 F.Supp.2d at 736; Prado, 975 F.Supp. at 1357; Long, 894 F.Supp. at \n941; Gonzalez, 1991 WL 11009376, at *3. \n\nPlaintiffs argue that customers do not actually find it rude when someone speaks a foreign \nlanguage in front of them, and instead find rules mandating English offensive. In support of \ntheir argument, they mention a recent local news story in which a donut shop manager \nremoved an \"English Only\" sign after customers objected on behalf of the shop's \nemployees. Opp. Mem. at 18 n. 11. The EEOC relies on a hearsay news story in an \nendeavor to undercut Sephora's rationale for believing customers \"feel welcome\" when its \nemployees speak English in their presence. Id. Apart from the prohibition on reliance in the \nsummary judgment context on inadmissible hearsay, as we explained above we do not \nbelieve Sephora's justifications rest on customer preference. Furthermore, Sephora need \nnot demonstrate that a particular percentage of customers' opinions corroborate its \nbusiness judgment that certain behavior is impolite and unhelpful. We \"do[] not sit as a \nsuperpersonnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions.\" Scaria v. \nRubin, 117 F.3d 652, 655 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting Dale v. Chicago Tribune Co., 797 F.2d \n458, 464 (7th Cir.1986)). \nFurthermore, the business necessities Sephora describes are similar to those the EEOC \nitself has suggested are proper. The EEOC's Compliance Manual provides that \"situations \nin which business necessity would justify an English-only rule\" include \"communications \nwith customers, coworkers, or supervisors who only speak English,\" \"situations in which \nworkers must speak a common language to promote safety,\" \"cooperative work \nassignments in which the English-only rule is needed to promote efficiency,\" and \"No \nenable a supervisor who only speaks English to monitor the performance of an employee \nwhose job duties require communication with coworkers or customers.\" Adams Decl., Ex. \n47 (\"EEOC Compliance Manual\") at 13-23. Sephora's own business justifications overlap \nand are consistent with those suggested by the Compliance Manual. \nWe agree with the EEOC that \"Mt is common for individuals whose primary language is not \nEnglish to inadvertently change from speaking English to speaking their primary language,\" \nand with its recommendation that an employer should therefore \"inform its employees of the \ngeneral circumstances when speaking only in English is required and of the consequences \nof violating the rule.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1606.7(c). Speaking English is undoubtedly less \ncomfortable for some bilingual people than speaking another language, and the EEOC \ntherefore makes the eminently 418*418reasonable suggestion that employers evaluating \nwhether to adopt a rule consider the \"English proficiency of workers affected by the rule.\" \nEEOC Compliance Manual at 13-24. But plaintiffs rely on the extreme views of Dr. Susan \nBerk-Seligson, who holds a Ph.D in linguistics, about the supposed inability of bilingual \nHispanics to refrain from speaking Spanish. Adams Decl., Ex. 35 (Declaration of Susan \nBerk-Seligson, Ph.D. (\"Berk-Seligson Decl.\")). Setting aside the issue of the admissibility of \nDr. Berk-Seligson's declaration under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 \n\nU.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), we point out that the EEOC's litigation \nadoption of Dr. Berk-Seligson's views is inconsistent with its statements in the Compliance \nManual. While the Compliance Manual contemplates the circumstances that are appropriate \nfor an English-only rule, Dr. Berk-Seligson claims that Hispanic bilinguals will speak \nSpanish unless they are \"threatened withcorporal punishment or actually . . . punished.\" \nBerk-Seligson Decl. ¶ 5 (emphasis added). Moreover, there is no suggestion that this case \nis about instances of reversion to one's native tongue for a single word or phrase. \nWe therefore conclude that the English language policy set forth in the Recap is job related \nfor Sephora consultants and cashiers, and is consistent with business necessity. \n3. Plaintiffs Have Failed to Demonstrate A Less Discriminatory Alternative to The Recap \nEnglish Policy \nAfter an employer demonstrates that a challenged policy is \"job related for the position in \nquestion and consistent with business necessity,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(I), the \nburden of persuasion \"shifts back to the plaintiffs, who must establish the availability of an \nalternative policy or practice that would also satisfy the asserted business necessity, but \nwould do so without producing the disparate effect.\"Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161 (citing 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii), (C); other citations omitted). In this regard, plaintiffs argue that \nthe problems Sephora perceives as stemming from \"cast\" speaking foreign languages \naround customers are actually the result of their standing around talking to each other \ninstead of greeting and assisting customers. Opp. Mem. at 17. Plaintiffs therefore argue that \na less discriminatory alternative measure to the English rule set out in the Recap would be a \nrule emphasizing the greeting policy and discouraging \"cast\" from standing around talking to \neach other. Opp. Mem. at 21. This fails entirely as an alternative policy because it does not \naddress when Sephora may require employees to speak English. We find that plaintiffs \nhave failed to satisfy the third stage of the burden shifting framework by raising a material \nissue of fact as to the availability of a less discriminatory alternative to the English policy set \nout in the Recap. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the policy on the use of English outlined in the Recap is \nlegally permissible and therefore grant defendants' motion for partial summary judgment on \nthat issue. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n\n[1] The five named employees are Leydis Rodriguez, Angela Samboy, Solange Bernal, Julissa Bautista, and Mariela \nDel Rosario (\"plaintiffs-intervenors\"). \n[2] The individual defendants are Frank Cimitile (\"Cimitile\"), Diana Saini (\"Saini\"), Misa Gjonbalaj (\"Gjonbalaj\"), and \nRichard Tran (\"Tran\"). \n[3] Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are taken from the parties' statements pursuant to Local Civil Rule \n56.1. These are Defendants' Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts (\"Defs. 56.1 Stmt.\"); Plaintiffs' Local Rule \n56.1 Statement of Disputed Material Facts in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"Pls. \n56.1 Stmt.\"), whose paragraph numbers correspond to those in Defs. 56.1 Stmt.; and the second part of Pls. 56.1 \nStmt. titled \"Plaintiffs' Additional Relevant Material Facts\" (\"Pls. 56.1 Stmt. 2\"), which starts numbering paragraphs \ndetailing plaintiffs' additional factual allegations with \"1\". \n[4] Plaintiffs deny that all Sephora stores employ first-level supervisors. Pls. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 3. \n[5] Sephora alleges, and plaintiff denies, that the same is true of cashiers. \n[6] Plaintiffs deny that all store managers participate in the calls. \n[7] As plaintiffs correctly point out, a number of their claims are outside the scope of this motion to dismiss. Opp. \nMem. at 1-2. Among these are the claims that defendants violated Title VII by enforcing an unlawful English-only rule \nbefore the distribution of the Recap, by continuing unlawful discrimination after the Recap was issued, by taking other \nunlawful actions based on national origin, and by retaliating against employees who complained about discrimination. \n[8] The EEOC brought this case under Title VII, while plaintiffs-intervenors are suing under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 \nand the New York State and New York City Human Rights Laws. In general, we analyze claims under § 1981 and the \nstate and city statutes in the same manner and therefore, where applicable, our disparate impact analysis here \nextends to claims under all those statutes. SeeCruz v. Coach Stores, Inc., 202 F.3d 560, 565 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000). We \nnote that there is no disparate impact claim under § 1981. Scelsa v. City University of New York, 806 F.Supp. 1126, \n1145 (S.D.N.Y.1992). \n[9] Plaintiffs contend that \"in reality,\" Sephora managers have acted as if Sephora has an English-only rule that \nrequires only English to be spoken at all times in the workplace. Opp. Mem. at 8 The EEOC guidelines presume that \na rule of that type violates Title VII. 29 C.F.R. § 1606.7(a). See alsoEEOC v. Premier Operator Servs., Inc., 113 \nF.Supp.2d 1066 (N.D.Tex. 2000) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1606.7(a) and holding that \"[a] blanket policy or practice \nprohibiting the speaking of a language other than English on an employer's premises at all times, except when \nspeaking to a non-English speaking customer, violates Title VII's prohibition against discrimination based on national \norigin.\") (emphasis added). This motion, however, only concerns the policy outlined in the Recap, which is plainly a \n\"certain times\" type rule of the kind described in 29 C.F.R. § 1606.7(b). The plaintiffs' statement that \"[i]t is impossible \nto separate\" Sephora's written policy \"from the practices carried out by Sephora management,\" Opp. Mem. at 5, and \ntheir argument that we cannot determine the legality of the policy embodied in the Recap on a motion for summary \njudgment, Opp. Mem. at 6, confuse the policy embodied in the Recap with the application of English language policy \nby individual managers. \n[10] Defendants urge us to reject the EEOC's guidelines as contrary to Title VII. Support Mem. at 9-12 (citing Garcia \nv. Spun Steak, 998 F.2d 1480 (9th Cir.1993); Velasquez v. Goldwater Mem'l Hosp., 88 F.Supp.2d 257, 262 \n(S.D.N.Y.2000); Kania v. Archdiocese of Phila., 14 F.Supp.2d 730, 735-36 (E.D.Pa. 1998); Long v. First Union Corp. \nof Va., 894 F.Supp. 933, 940-41 (E.D.Va.1995)). The parties have devoted minimal briefing to explaining the level of \ndeference we owe to the EEOC's guidelines. Plaintiffs address deference superficially, citing only to Justice Scalia's \nconcurring opinion in Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., 544 U.S. 228, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), in which \nhe reiterates his adherence to the view of deference expressed in his lone dissent in United States v. Mead Corp.,533 \nU.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). Defendants argue that we should reject the EEOC's guidelines \nhere as inconsistent with Title VII. Support Mem. at 12 n. 11. \n[11] We note that although plaintiffs' memorandum follows the analysis framework for a disparate impact claim, it is \nalso sprinkled with occasional allegations that the policy expressed in the Recap was promulgated and enforced with \nthe aim of discriminating against Hispanic employees, suggesting a disparate treatment theory. See, e.g., Opp. Mem. \nat 3 (\"a dispute of fact exists as to whether Defendants have intentionally discriminated against a class of Hispanic \nemployees\") (emphasis \n\n[12] Gerdom also rejected the employer's justification that customers prefer slim female flight attendants because the \njustification was not neutral, but was instead discriminatory on its face.Gerdom, 692 F.2d at 609. \n ",
