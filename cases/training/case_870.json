    "summary": "<p>In 1973, six inmates of the Special Housing Unit  at the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York against officials of the Department of Corrections.  The inmates were represented by the Legal Aid Society and Prisoners' Rights Project.  The inmates were confined in the Special Housing unit after becoming involved in the 1971 uprising at the state's Attica Correctional facility. </p><p>In their complaint the plaintiffs requested declaratory relief relating to four allegations: 1) due process violations stemming from the prison's Adjustment Committee's having failed to provide written notice of disciplinary charges before confining them to the special housing unit; 2) state violations due to the denial of exercise of one hour a day; 3) constitutional rights violations from the imposition of certain strip searches; and 4) due process violations from ineffective access to the courts due to a policy that prohibited special housing unit inmates access to the prison library, that allowed them only two law books a day, and that prohibited them from having legal assistance from the inmates in the segregation unit.  </p><p>The Court (Judge James T. Foley) 1) dismissed the claim of lack of due process in the disciplinary procedures for failure to prove any federal constitutional deprivations or violations; 2) agreed that the denial of adequate exercise and recreation for prisoners in the special housing unit constituted cruel and unusual punishment and found that an appropriate regulation would be to allow them one hour of exercise outside a day; 3) agreed that certain cavity searches conducted on inmates constituted unreasonable searches and cruel and unusual punishment; and 4) held that inmates in the special housing unit were not denied due process in their limited access to legal books or the library because of the state's interest in temporary segregation for punitive purposes and because the inmates of the unit have equal access to legal services around the state.  Frazier v. Ward, 426 F.Supp. 1354 (N.D.N.Y. 1977).  A decree was submitted by the plaintiffs' attorneys on the two successful claims.</p><p>In 1987 three more plaintiffs' cases were heard on the same claims in the same court.  Two of the three plaintiffs had been members of the class of the 1973 action, but had not been notified that their individual claims could be precluded by the class action.  The defendants raised several procedural defenses (collateral estoppel, res judicata, Eleventh Amendment immunity) and the Court (Judge Howard G. Munson) found, in general, in favor the plaintiffs on their procedural due process claims against the defendants and were awarded nominal and compensatory damages and attorneys' fees.  Morgan v.

D. New York.\nFebruary 17, 1977.\n1355 *1355 William E. Hellerstein, Warren H. Richmond, III, Michael B. Mushlin, The Legal Aid Society, Prisoners'\nRights Project, New York City, for plaintiffs; Warren H. Richmond, III, Michael B. Mushlin, New York City, of\ncounsel.\nLouis J. Lefkowitz, Atty. Gen. of State of N. Y., Albany, N. Y., for defendants; Timothy F. O'Brien, Jack W. Hoffman,\nAsst. Attys. Gen., Albany, of counsel.\nJAMES T. FOLEY, Chief Judge.\nMEMORANDUM-DECISION and ORDER\nThis suit filed in behalf of inmates of the Special Housing Unit, known as Unit 14, at the Clinton Correctional\n1356 Facility, Dannemora, *1356 New York, as many similar suits do, constitutes a prolonged litigation. Unit 14 is\ndescribed in the record of the trial of this case as \"a prison within a prison, or a jail within a jail\". It is used for the\nconfinement of prisoners who violate institutional rules and are confined therein in segregation for disciplinary\npurposes. Out of a large prison population of usually 1500 to 1900 inmates, as the amended complaint states,\nand the trial record indicates, the number of those so confined is actually minimal 00 there not being more, so\n97\nconfined, at any given time than approximately 20. This two-judge federal district court in this upstate Northern\nDistrict of New York, has within its boundaries three maximum security prisons or correctional facilities, as now\ncalled, of New York State: Auburn at Auburn, New York; Clinton at Dannemora, New York; and Great Meadow at\nComstock, New York. The total population of the three averages in the neighborhood of 5,000.\nMy contact with Unit 14 at Clinton, known to the inmates in their language as \"the Box\", as a federal judge is\nunmatchable. I had to consider serious claims challenging on federal constitutional grounds, living conditions\ninvolved in confinement there on two previous occasions and render rulings of a very sensitive nature. The\nrulings were highly important ones. It was my belief from this federal contact and substantial appellate review in\none that further need for the federal judicial scrutiny of Unit 14, at least during my service as a district judge, was\nremote. See Wright v. McMann, 321 F.Supp. 127 (N.D.N.Y.1970),aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds,460\nF.2d 126 (2d Cir. 1972),cert. den.,409 U.S. 885, 93 S.Ct. 115, 34 L.Ed.2d 141 (1972); Ray v. Rockefeller, 352\nF.Supp. 750 (N.D.N.Y.1973), appeal by plaintiffs dismissed by Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 1/23/74, for\nfailure to prosecute. However, the necessity to canvass challenges again as to certain aspects of the living\nconditions and rules governing Unit 14 claimed to measure up to federal constitutional violations and deprivations\nconfronts me for the third time.\nThe past history of this present suit was set forth in detail in my memorandum-decision and order of December 8,\n1974. The heavy burden that the numerous filings by prisoners in this district as noted in Wright and Ray, supra,\nwas reemphasized in that particular decision by pointing out that this action was started pro se under other\ninmates names and was dismissed by my decision of July 6, 1973. This decision was reversed by a three-judge\npanel of the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, by a 2-1 decision of October 2, 1973, with express remand \"to\n\nconduct an evidentiary hearing upon the Motion for Preliminary Injunction\". Thereafter, in accord with this reversal\nand remand, I had to write five more decisions. By decision dated December 4, 1973, I appointed The Legal Aid\nSociety, Prisoners' Rights Project, the present attorneys, who filed an Amended Complaint on August 1, 1974. My\ndecision of December 6, 1974, granted their motion for class action maintenance and granted an important\ndiscovery motion that directed the answer to an interrogatory that necessitated the search of many records by the\ndefendants of inmates confined in Unit 14 from June 1, 1973 to May 15, 1974. Extensive discovery procedures\nwere undertaken by these experienced and able lawyers of the Prisoners' Rights Project after the remand for\nevidentiary hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction transforming the directed evidentiary hearing into a full\nblown trial on four claims in the amended complaint.\nThe trial commenced May 12, 1975 and ended May 15, 1975. The request for injunctive relief was withdrawn, no\nmoney damages were sought, and only declaratory relief on the four claims requested. The trial transcript\nconsisted of 765 pages and was not received by me until August 4, 1975. The formal final briefing with proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law was submitted as of October 6, 1975, but there has been further and\nconsistent communication from the attorneys to the court concerning important legal rulings in the federal courts\n1357 at every level that pertain to the issues in this action. There has also been attention called to legislative and \n*1357 administrative developments and changes that have occurred in New York State that have bearing on the\nissues here.\nIt has been my experience as a federal judge from practically daily contact in recent years with these state prison\nproblems that good faith efforts to attain needed reforms in the prison system of New York have taken place.\nThere is evident a desire to attain sensible, practical and realistic reforms. Many of the grievances complained of\nin the Wright case about living conditions and rules of confinement in the segregation unit were corrected\nprevious to the actual trial of the issues. Presently, as we know from widespread media coverage, the problems\nin New York State prisons are currently undergoing intense examination and investigation, legislatively and\nadministratively. Public hearings have been held in Albany by various committees of the New York State\nLegislature in the past year to bring public attention to the problems and point up the critical need for their\nsolution. Viewpoints of every kind from administrators, superintendents, penologists, inmates and correction\nofficials and officers were heard and considered in a worthwhile attempt to reach solutions that will alleviate the\nunrest that exists in prisons not only in New York, but throughout the Nation. As I noted in Wright, supra, 321\nF.Supp. at p. 136, no one will ever have all the answers, but I believe these efforts sincerely undertaken will bear\nfruit; the turmoil will subside. Balanced decisions will be made that will insure fair and humane treatment that New\nYork citizens want accorded to the inmates with safeguards maintained to protect the interests of the public and\ncorrection officers in the paramount consideration of security in the institutions. New York has not been by any\nmeans a backward state in the maintenance of its state prison system from my contact with such matters. The\nrecord in this case as it did in Wright and Ray is to the contrary. Radical changes have been made by New York\nlegislation, and by administrative rules and regulations promulgated to govern the maximum security prisons, or\ncorrectional facilities as now called. Grievance and liaison committees with inmate representation have been\nformed in progressive attempts to relieve animosities and tensions that exist in the institutions between inmates\nand fellow inmates, and inmates and correction officers. The autonomy that Wardens had in the administration of\ntheir prisons has vanished. In this confined atmosphere, where large prison populations have to be guarded and\nserviced, the necessities of life are adequately furnished with programs for education and recreation in old\ninstitutions that are kept in a good state of cleanliness and repair. Reasonable access to see the conditions in the\nprisons and to interview inmates has been accorded to the media. The simple answer to overcrowding as is\nobvious is to build new prisons, and particularly to construct them in areas where visits are possible and not too\ndistant from home areas where most of the inmates in maximum security prisons come from. Such projects\nwould necessitate substantial expenditures that may not be within reach in these days of financial difficulties in\nNew York. The hard fact of life also is that there is little public enthusiasm for such undertakings and no particular\narea seems to welcome the erection of maximum security prisons in its confines. New York learned bitter lessons\nfrom the Attica tragedy. The present Governor, legislators and correctional officials should not be continuously\nbelabored about it but should be allowed to move forward in new constructive approaches. They should be given\nthe credit due in their commendable efforts to expose the problems to public awareness and attract public\nsupport for proper reforms that should be proposed. The closed world that existed in the prisons of New York\nsome years ago no longer exists.\n\nIn cases of this kind, I am ever mindful of the limited right the federal courts have to adjudicate claims that arise\nfrom state prison confinement. Noted opinions have been handed down from every level of the federal court\nsystem that advise extreme caution in adjudicating claims that essentially involve the general administration of a\n1358 state prison and do not reach, as they *1358 must, to warrant federal court intervention and decree, the level of\nconstitutional violations. See Rhem v. McGrath, 326 F.Supp. 681, 689 (S.D.N.Y.1971). Chief Judge Kaufman of\nthe Second Circuit set forth the reason for this principle in striking and memorable language:\nIt is not only that we, trained as judges, lack expertise in prison administration. Even a lifetime of\nstudy in prison administration and several advanced degrees in the field would not qualify us as a\nfederal court to command state officials to shun a policy that they have decided is suitable\nbecause to us the choice may seem unsound or personally repugnant. Sostre v. McGinnis, 442\nF.2d 178, 191 (2d Cir. 1971). (Emphasis in original).\nThe United States Supreme Court has continuously expressed the adherence that must be maintained to this\ndoctrine of restraint from undue interference in the administration of state prisons unless federal constitutional\nviolations and deprivation are clearly evident. The principle has been enunciated again and again with a variety in\nthe language of expression, but the dominant thought remains clear. The most recent statement about the settled\nprinciple is contained in Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976), stating that the\nfederal courts do not sit to supervise state prisons, the administration of which is of acute interest to the State, \nciting Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491-492, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S.\n319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 486, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d\n718 (1969). The Johnson case is often cited and states at p. 486, 89 S.Ct. at p. 749:\nThere is no doubt that discipline and administration of state detention facilities are state functions.\nThey are subject to federal authority only where paramount federal constitutional or statutory\nrights supervene. It is clear, however, that in instances where state regulations applicable to\ninmates of prison facilities conflict with such rights, the regulations may be invalidated.\nThe Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, in accord with the general caution of restraint has ruled that prison\nauthorities must of necessity be allowed wide discretion in the use of protective confinement for the purpose of\nprotecting the safety and security of the prison and the general population. Circuit Judge Mulligan in regard to\nthese state prisoner cases, with notable phrase, advises that the federal judges are not ombudsmen charged with\nthe responsibility of reforming the State penal system. Wallace v. Kern, 520 F.2d 400, 408 (2d Cir. 1975); see\nalso McRedmond v. Wilson, 533 F.2d 757, 766 (2d Cir. 1976) (Van Graafeiland, C. J. dissenting).\nOf course, it is and must be recognized that these guidelines and cautions are very difficult at times to follow\nwhen broad federal constitutional protections are invoked for a particular factual situation. It is a hard test for the\nhumanism of a federal judge, not to want to correct policies and regulations that to him seem harsh and arbitrary\neven when he tries conscientiously to apply the principle that personal aversion and predilections are not to enter\nthe judicial mind when grievances arising from state prison administration are presented for judicial decision. It\nhas been noted that the failure in the past of legislators to take proper correctional action to remedy inhuman\nconditions has eroded the historical reluctance of federal courts to interfere with the administration of penal\ninstitutions. Detainees of Brooklyn House of Detention for Men v. Malcolm, Commissioner, 520 F.2d 392, at 397\n(2d Cir. 1975). Federal judges must be circumspect not to interfere without warrant and subject themselves to the\nsuspicion that \"it is the office of a good judge to enlarge his jurisdiction.\" 1 Works of Thomas Jefferson 121-22\n(Federal ed. 1904). The practices complained of in these settings still have to be weighed and assessed in the\nlight that central to all other correctional goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within the\ncorrectional facilities themselves. Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974). It\n1359 has been clearly *1359 stated by the highest judicial authority of the land and has to be accepted that a prisoner\nis not wholly stripped of constitutional protections when he is imprisoned for crime. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S.\n539, 555-556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).\nIn my decision of December 6, 1974, I summarized and listed in this order the four claims remaining in the\ncomplaint. The brief description set forth was in this order: (1) Adjustment Committee's failure to provide written\nnotice of disciplinary charges before confinement in Unit 14; (2) denial of adequate exercise in violation of 7\n\nNYCRR Section 301.5(6) providing for exercise of one hour per day; (3) imposition of humiliating strip searches\nwith rectal and testicle examination before contact with visitors; (4) denial of effective access to the courts\ninasmuch as Unit 14 inmates are not allowed access to the prison law library privileges, and are only provided\ntwo law books per day, and not permitted to have legal assistance from the inmates in the segregation unit.\nIn the discussion of the claims in this decision, this order shall not be followed but the claims shall be discussed\nin order of their importance and constitutional substance as they impressed me as a trial judge and after\nextensive legal research into this ever changing field of law. My prolonged reflection and search, I believe, is\nwarranted because the caution pronounced so often, unless such are to be placed in the realm of empty words,\nthat federal courts should not interfere in state prison administration unless federal constitutional deprivations and\nviolations are evident and proven.\nAs often occurs, changes have taken place since the filing of the original complaint in this case, in the rules and\nregulations that do, in my judgment, affect certain of the issues presented herein, followed by appeals, remand,\nand filing of an amended complaint. These changes, I find from long experience are usually good faith efforts by\nNew York correction administrators and officials to comply in the majority of instances with the numerous federal\ncourt rulings that have been handed down in recent years by the federal courts in the Second Circuit resulting\nfrom New York State prisoners filing numerous claims alleging varied constitutional deprivations under the federal\ncivil rights statutes.\nTherefore, before entering upon the evaluation of the particular claims and my conclusions regarding them, it\nmight be well to set forth the comprehensive statement of Justice Stewart regarding the important and competing\nfactors and objectives that are present and must be considered, the need to weigh the important interests of\nsociety that are at stake, exercising careful appraisal of the impact and consequences that may follow from\nfederal judicial decrees. Justice Stewart summarized them in these words:\nAn important function of the corrections system is the deterrence of crime. The premise is that by\nconfining criminal offenders in a facility where they are isolated from the rest of society, a condition\nthat most people presumably find undesirable, they and others will be deterred from committing\nadditional criminal offenses. This isolation, of course, also serves a protective function by\nquarantining criminal offenders for a given period of time while, it is hoped, the rehabilitative\nprocesses of the corrections system work to correct the offender's demonstrated criminal\nproclivity. Thus, since most offenders will eventually return to society, another paramount objective\nof the corrections system is the rehabilitation of those committed to its custody. Finally, central to\nall other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within the\ncorrections facilities themselves. It is in the light of these legitimate penal objectives that a court\nmust assess challenges to prison regulations based on asserted constitutional rights of prisoners.\nPell v. Procunier, supra, 417 U.S. 817, 822-823, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).\n(Underscoring supplied).\n1360 *1360 I 0907 THE RECTAL AND TESTICLE VISUAL SEARCH\nThe above description of the subject to be discussed herein is a literal one of the actual incidents that take place\nwhen such type search, challenged in this suit, is visually conducted by correction officers when inmates leave\nUnit 14, the segregation Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility for certain purposes, and upon return to the Unit. The\ncorrection terminology for the search, used in New York and elsewhere, is much more euphemistic and less\nattention calling. The usual examination of these particular parts of the body is termed a strip frisk search.\nTitle 7 of NYCRR 1020.5, a section of the New York Official Compilation Codes, Rules and Regulations governing\ncorrectional services filed December 24, 1974, sets forth the definitions of the type frisking of the person of\ninmates in the institutions that are authorized.\n\n1020.5 Definitions (a) A pat frisk means a search of an inmate's person and his clothes while the\ninmate is clothed, except that an inmate shall be required to remove hat and shoes. The search\nshall include reaching into the inmate's clothing.\n(b) A strip frisk means a search of an inmate's person and his clothes after the inmate has\nremoved all his clothing. The search includes a thorough inspection of the clothing and a close\nvisual inspection of the inmate's person, including body cavities. If there is reasonable cause to\nbelieve contraband has been concealed in a body cavity, the inmate shall be immediately\nexamined and/or x-rayed by a facility health staff member.\nThe next section of Title 7, particularly relevant and important to the issue here, was filed December 24, 1974, but\nwas amended substantially in its wording and instructions, effective December 18, 1975, a date months after the\ntrial of this case in May 1975. This section is 7 NYCRR 1020.25 providing as amended:\n1020.25 Special housing units. (a) An inmate is to be strip frisked before leaving a special housing\nunit:\n(1) if there are reasonable grounds to believe the inmate has a weapon or dangerous contraband\nconcealed on his person; or\n(2) if the inmate has a history of committing assaults on facility personnel or of possessing\ndangerous contraband.\nIn all other cases, an inmate is to be pat frisked before leaving a special housing unit.\n(b) An inmate is to be strip frisked before leaving a special housing unit if he is to leave the facility\nfor any reason.\n(c) Upon return to a special housing unit, every inmate will be strip frisked.\nBefore the amendment of December 18, 1975, Section 1020.25 merely stated:\nBefore and after a visit, an inmate assigned to a segregation unit or other special housing unit in any facility\npursuant to a detention admission, adjustment admission, or protective shall be thoroughly strip frisked.\n(underscoring mine).\nThis substantial change in the regulation after the trial of this issue, on a different worded one, in regard to strip\nfrisk searches presents at the threshold the question of mootness. The question was recognized by counsel for\nthe plaintiffs, and their response to it was by letter to me of May 21, 1976, after the extensive brief on all the\nissues tried was filed with the Clerk on September 10, 1975. The letter shall be filed with the Clerk with this\ndecision. The position without reference to case law on mootness was that under the wording of the change in 7\nNYCRR 1020.25, effective 12/18/75, the constitutional infirmity remains because under the new rule, searches\nare routinely permitted without any justification upon return to Unit 14, and that under the changed section, Unit\n14 inmates, allegedly dangerous, must continue to undergo the rectal examination at all times despite a lack of\nreal suspicion that such strip frisk search is justified. I am inclined to agree with this interpretation of the change\nin regard to mootness being not applicable. It does appear that the strip frisk issue is still open as one within the\n1361 original challenge as being made routinely *1361 and without reasonable grounds. Therefore, it is my opinion, the\nissue remains alive even under the new and more detailed terminology of the new and amended Section, 7\nNYCRR 1020.25.\nFurther, independent research of leading case law in the federal appellate system supports this opinion that the\ndoctrine of mootness should not be applied because of the change in the old rule that prevailed when this case\nwas tried. Whether a request for declaratory relief becomes moot depends upon whether there remains a\nsubstantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment. \nPreiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 402, 95 S.Ct. 2330, 45 L.Ed.2d 272 (1975). In that case weight was given to\nthe fact that the action was not a class action, and this present one as noted previously has been so designated.\nA factor to be considered is whether there is reasonable expectation the wrong will continue or be repeated. \n\nUnited States v. W. T. Grant, 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416\nU.S. 312, 318-319, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974); Nieves v. Oswald, 498 F.2d 802, 813-815 (2d Cir.\n1974); Armstrong v. Ward, 529 F.2d 1132 (2d Cir. 1976); Allee v. Medrano, 416 U.S. 802, 810-11, 94 S.Ct. 2191,\n40 L.Ed.2d 566 (1974). From my review of these cases, it is my judgment that with the application of their\nprinciples in regard to mootness, the issue of the strip frisk search under the amended rule cannot be considered\nas mooted. It seems clear that the issue of routine strip frisk upon return from inside facility visits for certain\npurposes or if the inmate has a certain case history of assaults or concealing contraband gives vitality to the\nissue sufficient to overcome mootness.\nAlso, other considerations must be discussed before reaching the merits of the four claims. Declaratory judgment\nrelief which is the only relief expressly sought in this action now, under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, is a discretionary\nremedy or power conferred upon the federal courts. Public Serv. Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 73 S.Ct.\n236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952); Beacon Const. Co., Inc. v. Matco Electric Co., Inc., 521 F.2d 392, 397 (2d Cir. 1975). It\nis settled that discretion to decline jurisdiction for declaratory judgment exists, but such discretion cannot be\nexercised against entertainment of controversies that are justiciable and actual. Muller v. Olin Mathieson\nChemical Co., 404 F.2d 501 (2d Cir. 1968). In my judgment, the exercise of such discretion at this stage would\nnot be sound, and it is clear that the issues are of importance and the assuming of jurisdiction will serve the\npublic interest. See Hanes Corp. v. Millard, 174 U.S.App.D.C. 253, 531 F.2d 585, 591-92 (1976). It should be\nnoted that this judgment is reached despite recent legislation in New York State which provides access to State\ncourts by State prisoners and gives them new rights and remedies in the State courts. See New York Civil Rights\nLaw, Section 79-a to 79-j; New York Correction Law, Section 610. Also, New York Correction Law, Section 139\nestablishes a grievance procedure whereby prisoners may petition up to the Commissioner of Corrections, and\nthereafter to an independent Commission of Correction for review of adverse determinations. Although not\nspecifically provided, it seems probable that in these situations, courts of New York would entertain review of\nthese final administrative decisions under Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law & Rules (CPLR). See \nRodriguez v. McGinnis, 456 F.2d 79, 85 (2d Cir. 1972) (Lumbard, C. J., dissenting), reversed sub nom. Preiser v.\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).\nThe other consideration of importance is whether decision herein on the merits at this District Court level of the\nstrip search issue is barred by previous rulings of this Court. Judge Port ruled in Sostre v. Preiser, 73-CV-421,\nN.D.N.Y., with citation of cases from other federal circuits, that the rectal search was not unconstitutional. On\nappeal, a Panel of the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, remanded for fuller development of the record on the\n1362 issue. Sostre v. Preiser, 519 F.2d 763 (2d Cir. 1975). As often happens in these State prisoner cases, *1362 after\nthe concentrated interest of several federal courts, the case faded away, probably due to the release of Sostre\nfrom confinement after his sentence was commuted. Significantly, in the Sostre remand decision, at p. 764, the\nCourt of Appeals referred to the \"indignities\" of the rectal search, and stated such search would have\nconstitutional implications if done for punishment and not genuinely related to internal prison security. It is also to\nmy mind a noteworthy sign of the attitude of that court toward the \"strip search\" involving probe of rectum by\nprison guards which it described as \"humiliating\". United States ex rel. Larkins v. Oswald, 510 F.2d 583, at p. 589\n(2d Cir. 1975).\nIn this record, these possible distinctions are overcome because there has been full exploration of the strip\nsearch issue expertly developed with details of the factual circumstances in which the rectal examination is made\nthat in this record are largely undisputed. For these reasons, previous rulings of this Court should not be held to\nbar consideration of the rectal search issue raised in this action, and particularly so, because of the comments of\nthe Second Circuit regarding the rectal search as pointed out above.\nMERITS OF THE SEARCH\nIn the record (R) of the trial of this action, there is evidence in detail, practically undisputed, concerning the\nmanner in which this rectal and testicle examination of the frisk strip search was conducted of the inmates who\nwere confined in Unit 14. Under the old regulation that, as pointed out, has been changed, I find as testified to\nand admitted in a deposition, the rectal and testicle examination of Unit 14 inmates was done routinely. It was\nnecessary for the inmate to undergo it before and after each personal or legal visit, each medical or educational\n\nexamination, and each court appearance (R. 36, dep. Pl. Ex. 25, p. 21; see also Pl. Ex. 29). There is great detail\npresent in the record, again undisputed, as to what took place from the time the inmate was allowed out of his\nsegregation cell for a personal and legal visit and then returned after the visit to the same segregated cell. (R. 37,\n38, 40, 151-153, 155-156). The security measures taken: Each inmate being placed in a handcuff and belt\napparatus to go to his visit, after the strip frisk search, in the receiving room, and the procedures followed in the\nvisiting room in that regard are in the record and uncontradicted. (Pl. Ex. 7; R. 40, 43-44, 155, 191-192; Pl. Ex.\n24, pp. 13-14). The finding of these elements of the procedure and search are made with ease due to their\npractical admission.\nThe following is sufficient to summarize the events that surrounded the taking of the Unit 14 inmate to and from\npersonal and legal visits within the confines of the Facility. Each Unit 14 cell has a cell in the back of the one in\nwhich the inmate is confined. The back door of the inmate's cell to the rear cell area is opened when he is to go\nfor a visit. The inmate is then taken down a rear passageway, accompanied by an average of six correction\nofficers, usually armed with billy clubs. The inmate is brought to a receiving room where he strips naked in the\npresence of six to twelve correction officers, there to undergo the full strip search, with rectal and testicle visual\nexamination, which will be described below. The inmate, when this is completed, then puts on a different set of\nclothes. He is then placed in a handcuff and belt apparatus, which was demonstrated to me at the trial by actual\nattachment to the person. He is then taken to the visiting room without any contact with other inmates, and in the\nvisiting room alternate procedures regarding the handcuffs and belt are followed. They can be removed for the\nvisit, and there is frisking thereafter with a hand held metal detector, of if the handcuff and belt are not removed,\nthe inmate is not further searched or frisked at that time. The inmate in the visiting room is kept under the\nobservation of the correction officers who escorted him. The correction officer in charge of the visiting room is\nalso always present. Once the visit is concluded, the same procedures that were followed for exit to the visit are\n1363 gone through. The inmate is brought back to *1363 Unit 14 by the same officers, and again is required to strip\nnaked and undergo the full strip search before six to twelve correction officers. After that routine is completed, the\ninmate then changes into the set of clothing he was wearing prior to the visit and returned to his Unit 14 cell by\nthe back door area.\nI find ample support in this record that inmates would forego the legal and personal visits rather than undergo this\nsearch procedure, and that in some instances, where court appearances had to be complied with, unfortunately\nphysical force had to be imposed for the required strip frisk search. (R. 159-160, 698).\nI reserved decision on the offer of an inmate's affidavit regarding the refusal by inmates to go for their visit if they\nhad to undergo the rectal search. After consideration, the affidavit is received as competent and relevant\nevidence. (R. 548; Pl. Ex. 28 for id.) There is no question raised or challenge made in this action to the\nrequirement for strip frisk searches when an inmate leaves or returns to the Facility from the outside world.\nAt the trial, two inmates from Unit 14 were brought to court to testify for the plaintiffs. One was Born Allah, who\nhad in the past thirteen and one-half months to the time of trial been confined in Unit 14 except for twenty-eight\ndays, and David J. Hiney, who to the time of trial was in Unit 14 for ten of the last nineteen months. I believe that\nthe description of the rectal and testicle search examination and the actual circumstances of the conduct is best\nset forth in the testimony of Born Allah:\nA. . . . as I said before that the officer informs us we have a legal visit, he goes through the all-\nclear procedures and when we are directed from the back door onto the corridor of our back cells\nitself and directed to the receiving room and the leaving room if you want to call it that, and there\nthe officers that is escorting us puts you like in a semi-circle where there is a table to your back,\nand your back is at the table, and the semi-circle is around the table from edge 00 edge to edge 00\n97 97\nAfter you are told to strip you are directed by one individual officer to raise your arms, allow him to\nsee your arm pits.\nQ. How many officers are present?\nA. Every time I came out, just about every time I came out it was always anywhere from six to\neight, and there has been occasions where there was approximately 12 officers . .\n\nAnd one particular officer directs you to lift your arms to examine your arm pits. He asks you to\nopen your mouth, wag your tongue, run your fingers through your hair, lift your testicles, skin back\nyour penis, then you are directed to turn around, lift your feet, left and right foot, and bend over,\nand that's the most humiliating part of the whole procedure in the sense there would be a lot of\noohs and aahs and good show . . . (R. 37-38).\nThe description of inmate Hiney does not vary too much from the above. (R. 151-153).\nAgain, there is no dispute or any offer of contradicting evidence that this was the manner in which the rectal\nsearch was conducted. (See Pl.Ex. 24, deposition of Deputy Superintendent Gard, pp. 10-11). There was no\ncorrection officer who may have actually engaged in the procedures at Clinton called to testify at the trial by the\ndefendants in disagreement with the description of Born Allah and Hiney. Most important, there is no\ncontradiction by testimony or affidavit to the sexually degrading comments allegedly made by the correction\nofficers during the visual inspection of the anus when the cheeks of the rectum were spread as testified to by\nBorn Allah and Hiney. (R. 38, 154, 159). There is no need to set forth herein the exact comments testified to by\nBorn Allah and Hiney during their experiences, but to state only that the expressions are of the type that would be\nforthcoming in the setting above described, particularly so, when there were no cautions, instructions or\n1364 guidelines apparently *1364 of any kind given orally or by a writing to control vocal expressions or remarks of the\nobservers. The testimony of one of the two witnesses offered for the defendants at the trial, the Director of\nSpecial Housing Programs, New York State Department of Correctional Services, was that he never observed the\nconduct of an actual strip frisk search of the inmates confined in Unit 14 at Clinton when they were taken from\ntheir segregation cells for visits. The other witness, a correctional lieutenant familiar and in contact with Unit 14\nand its inmates, shed no light on this accusation of sexual slurs and derisive comments by the escorting\ncorrection officers. (R. 616-700). There is no alternative but to find under this strong state of the proof in favor of\nthe plaintiffs that such comments were made by the correction officers during the visual inspection of the once\nconsidered private parts of the body.\nThe plaintiffs in support of their claims of the rectal search and denial of exercise in Unit 14 presented five expert\nwitnesses. It is an understatement to describe these witnesses as eminently qualified by educational background\nin their particular fields affecting correctional problems. However, most importantly, each had, in addition, a\nsubstantial and actual experience of contact in responsible positions with prisons, prisoners, prison life, and were\nfamiliar through this contact with the problems that arise in and from it. Their contacts of this kind and educational\nbackgrounds are in the record, in their testimony, and in exhibits, and are set forth in good summary in the\nplaintiffs' Post-Trial Memorandum with reference to the record on pages 3 through 5. I shall list herein only, with\nother detail when necessary, their positions at the time of trial:\nDonald H. Goff, Director of the National Prison Project for the United States Commission on Civil\nRights;\nDr. Frank Rundle, a psychiatrist in private practice. (Previously, Director of the Department of\nPsychiatry for the New York City Prison Health Services and Chief Psychiatrist for California\nTraining Facility in Soledad);\nWilliam G. Nagel, Executive Vice President, The American Foundation, Incorporated, and Director\nInstitute of Corrections of the American Foundation;\nDr. Bernard Rubin, practicing psychiatrist and lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School\nand Medical School. (Previously consultant to the Council for the Diagnosis and Treatment of\nCriminal Defendants in the State of Illinois; a member of Governor's Commission for a Unified\nCode of Correction in Alliance; and a research consultant at the Center for Studies of Criminal\nJustice at the University of Chicago Law School);\nGeorge Bohlinger, Director of Correction and Court Research, Law Enforcement Assistance\nAdministration, U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThis blue ribbon array of experts possessed not only theoretical knowledge, but a practical knowledge of the\nserious interests at stake that must be balanced in the actual prison setting. Their demeanor in their testimony\nwas impressive and the content of the testimony was persuasive and convincing. It was their unanimous\nagreement that in view of the isolated confinement in Unit 14, with limited items of bedding and certain type\narticles for hygiene allowed, with continuous quick searches during absence from the segregated cell for visits\nand twice a week showers, together with a routine complete monthly search, there was absolutely no justification\nfor the routine rectal search or any reason at all evident that this type of search was necessary, particularly when\nleaving Unit 14, for preservation of security. This conclusion is bolstered by the testimony of Correction\nLieutenant Fuller, who had substantial experience with Unit 14, that nothing had ever been discovered in the\nrectal searches of inmates leaving or upon their return to the Unit. R. 693. This lieutenant also testified he had no\nobjection to a policy that rectal searches should be made when there exists a reasonable belief contraband might\nbe present in the rectum, and that he \"could live with it\" if such became the policy at Clinton. R. 699. The\n1365 appraisal of plaintiffs' *1365 experts did not reject the need for the search if there was reasonable belief or\ngrounds for a judgment that contraband might be concealed in the rectal area. Their conclusion that the rectal\nsearch was unnecessary was based upon the facts that the removals were from sterile cells, with the inmate in\nhandcuffs and belt, and kept under continuous observation of correction officers, and that all such happenings\nwere within the confines of very limited areas of Clinton Correctional Facility. Several of the experts went to Unit\n14 for actual inspection of the cells and the inmates before the trial. There are in evidence photographs of the\ncells, back door area, and exercise yard. Pl. Exs. 10-18. It should be noted again to the credit of New York that no\nfault was found by these trained men with the housekeeping and cleanliness of conditions in Unit 14, and all\nagreed segregation units are necessary to enforce discipline and preserve security in prisons, particularly those\nwith large populations, but it was their opinion that segregated confinement for psychological reasons should be\nfor a limited time of 30 to 60 days.\nExpert Goff testified there was no reason under the circumstances for the rectal search because the inmates of\nUnit 14 were leaving \"a super tight maximum security unit\". R. 289. His basic objection was that the full strip\nsearch with rectal imposition was done routinely without any cause. R. 306. It was his opinion that the rectal\nsearch, admitting it may be a proper security measure in certain instances, is degrading to the correction officers\nas well as degrading to the inmates, and when an inmate has to go to court, it results in assault situations to force\nhim to bend over for inspection of rectum. R. 299-300. He testified, frankly, that it was justified, of course, if there\nwas reasonable suspicion of contraband. R. 309. Goff testified he knew of no other State system wherein rectal\nsearches are given unreservedly as is being done in Unit 14, and said the policy of routine rectal searches\nfollowed far outweighs, as being unnecessary, the possible security factors involved. R. 326-327.\nExpert Rundle testified he inspected Unit 14 on April 30, 1975, and spoke to the Sergeant in Charge and inmates.\nHe testified also that under the type confinement in Unit 14, the routine rectal search was unnecessary,\nhumiliating and makes the inmate feel helpless, leading to vulgarisms by correction officers. He testified that it is\ndifficult to hide anything of size inside the rectum, and in any event if contraband were concealed inside the\nrectum, it would not be discovered by visual observance of rectal area. R. 389-399, 440, 447.\nExpert Bohlinger, who was Superintendent of Massachusetts State Prison for ten years was surprised, in view of\nthe confinement at Unit 14, that a rectal search was made leaving the Unit; he testified he could see a skin\nsearch made coming back, but not rectal; and it was not smart to have rectal search as a matter of routine; and\nthat rectal search in his opinion is only necessary when coming in from the outside. R. 457-458.\nExpert Rubin, a physician, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst testified that \". . . don't think we need a doctor or\npsychiatrist to tell what's wrong with that rectal examination . . . it is a humiliation . . a psychological assault on\nthe prisoner . . . certainly be a last straw procedure in terms of making one feel like they didn't matter at all.\" R.\n493. He testified, \"I find it difficult by the largest stretch of imagination to conceive of this as a security measure.\"\nR. 494. He stated the rectal inspection is reminiscent of that of live stock, and it was his opinion many inmates\nwould stay in their cell rather than undergo the rectal inspection by correction officers, and even reject family\nvisits, which to his mind and from experience are most important and critical for prisoners. R. 495-496.\nThe important question that must be resolved is whether under the facts regarding the procedures carried out for\nrectal and testicle search there is conduct involved that violates federal constitutional protections. There is a\n\n1366 reasoned and persuasive district court opinion on this same problem of anal cavity inspection that is *1366\npersuasive to me in that it balances out conservatively and sensibly the vital interests that are at stake, namely, to\naccord the prisoner his constitutional rights and at the same time not strip the prison officials and correction\nofficers of their necessary wide discretion to make on-the-scene judgments in a tense prison atmosphere\nparticularly when dealing with troublesome inmates. The opinion is that of United States District Judge Clarkson\nS. Fisher, District of New Jersey, Hodges v. Klein, 412 F.Supp. 896 (D.C.N.J.1976). In that case, Judge Fisher\nagreed with the view of now Supreme Court Justice Stevens in Bonner v. Coughlin, 517 F.2d 1311 (7th Cir.\n1975), and other cases with a similar view set forth in the opinion, that prisoners are protected against\nunreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and do have a qualified right of privacy. I agree\nalso with the Bonner view and that of Judge Fisher, and find here under the facts that the anal cavity inspection\nsearch done routinely, under the old rule and under the new rule upon return from visits in the Facility, and if\npossessing a history of assaults on correction officers or possessing dangerous contraband violates the\nunreasonable search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment. I find and conclude that also under those\nparticular provisions of the new rule set forth and as applied, the constitutional wrong still exists as a recurring\none and violates the Fourth Amendment in those aspects. The inmates of Unit 14, from my experience with them,\nalways have a history that is not too favorable, and if such inmates are to be visually inspected, based solely\nupon their disciplinary record, the routineness of the search without reasonable belief or indication of\nconcealment would undoubtedly cover the majority of inmates in Unit 14.\nI have no intention to undertake the drafting of rules that would alleviate the constitutional wrong so described\nand found, but the wording of the preliminary injunction order of Judge Fisher that followed his decision might be\nhelpful. It should be emphasized again that an injunction is not sought in this action, but only declaratory\njudgment relief.\nIt is on this 29th day of April, 1976 ORDERED that the defendants, their employees, agents and\nthose acting on concert with them, be and are hereby enjoined from requiring or performing an\nanal examination of any inmate at Trenton State Prison, such examination consisting of a visual or\ndigital inspection of an inmate's anal cavity or requiring an inmate to bend over and spread his\nbuttocks, except that:\nAn inmate's anal cavity may be inspected by the passing of a metal detector over that portion of\nhis body; or\nAn inmate's anal cavity may be visually inspected before he enters or leaves the confines of the\ninstitution for any reason; or\nAn inmate's anal cavity may be visually inspected after a personal contact visit with a friend or\nrelative; or\nAn inmate's anal cavity may be visually inspected whenever a prison guard with a rank not lower\nthan Sergeant is satisfied that there is a reasonably clear indication that an inmate is concealing\nan item in his anal cavity; . . .\nIt is also my finding of fact that under the circumstances in which the rectal and testicle search is imposed for\ninmates of Unit 14, especially when security interests are not shown to any extent to be jeopardized, that the\nexamination as made under the written old regulations and under certain provisions of the new rule as previously\nindicated is humiliating and in this record shown by the preponderance of the evidence to be conducted in a\ndebasing manner and not for any genuine security purposes. It is my conclusion, serious as the terminology is,\nthat the rectal and testicle search not based upon reasonable belief standards, and extremely dehumanizing in its\nmethod of conduct with routine visual inspection of the rectum by groups of correction officers, constitutes cruel\nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n1367 *1367 We have been told by an eminent judge of the Second Circuit, and in this day of changing times it is\napparent to be unquestionably true, that no man can say today what the Eighth Amendment may mean tomorrow.\nMukmuk v. Commissioner of Dept. of Correctional Services, 529 F.2d 272, 277 (2d Cir. 1976) (per Gurfein, J.), \ncert. den.,426 U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 2238, 48 L.Ed.2d 838 (1976). As that case stated, the concept has been an\n\nevolving one in the United States Supreme Court. The latest review of the history of the Eighth Amendment was\nby Justice Marshall in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251, decided November 30,\n1976. The cruel and unusual punishment as stated in the Eighth Amendment, after a comprehensive review of\nthe leading precedents, has been described recently by the United States Supreme Court as not a static concept.\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976); Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S.\n280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976). The statement referred to often that the clause cruel and unusual\npunishment \"is not fastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by\na humane justice\" unquestionably is based upon a desire to promote the better instincts in human nature. \nWeems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 378, 30 S.Ct. 544, 553, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910); see also Trop v. Dulles, 356\nU.S. 86, at 100-104, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). A definition of the phrase, in my judgment, one most\nappropriate to the situation here, and one that has received wide recognition is this:\nGenerally, speaking, a punishment that amounts to torture, or that is grossly excessive in\nproportion to the offense for which it is imposed, or that is inherently unfair, or that is unnecessarily\ndegrading, or that is shocking or disgusting to people of reasonable sensitivity is a \"cruel and\nunusual\" punishment. And a punishment that is not inherently cruel and unusual may become so\nby reason of the manner in which it is inflicted.\nHolt v. Sarver, 309 F.Supp. 362, 380 (E.D. Ark.1970). (underscoring supplied).\nII 00 DENIAL OF ADEQUATE EXERCISE AND RECREATION\n97\nAs in the rectal and testicle examination issue of the evidence produced by the plaintiffs in regard to unjustified\nand unconstitutional deprivation of exercise and fresh air for the inmates of Unit 14, for long periods of time, is\nformidable, persuasive and practically undisputed. Again, the testimony of the experts that outdoor exercise and\ncontact, amounting to a recreation period while confined in the segregated cells in Unit 14 should be permitted for\nat least one hour each day because of the circumstances of their confinement and should never be withheld as a\nmatter of discipline must, in my judgment, be accorded great weight in the constitutional determination to be\nmade (Goff 272-274, 343; Rundle 368-370, 373; Bohlinger 451-452, 454; Rubin 478-479; Nagel 734-736).\nUnit 14 inmates are in their cells every day during their segregated confinement, in a building now called a\nSpecial Housing Unit. Such isolated confinement is usually imposed for disciplinary reasons and the inmates are\nwithin their cells most days for at least twenty-three hours a day (R. 30, 128). They are taken out of their cells\ntwice a week for showers; once a week for disciplinary review and meetings; and for certain legal, family and\nmedical visits in the manner described in Part I of this decision (R. 27). They have no other program or other\nactivities and as inmate Hiney testified, there is nothing to do for the greater portion of the day, but sleep in the\ncell (R. 135-138). The cells are 7ยฝ\" ร 10\" 0' ร 8\" 0', and do have bunk bed, foam rubber mattress, combination\ntoilet-sink unit, radiator, and a fluorescent light in the ceiling. There is no chair or table (R. 26, 128, 129). Inmates\nhave adequate bedding, a toothbrush, toothpaste, plastic basin, and are allowed to have writing pads, pen or\npencil, and limited amounts of legal and reading material (R. 26-27, 128-129). There is no view of the other cells\npossible, and no direct sunlight enters any cell (R. 26, 30). Even when these inmates who are confined for\n1368 breaking the rules of the Facility *1368 are taken for visits, showers, or disciplinary hearings, it is by exit from the\nback door cell area, and they see no other inmates in Unit 14 (R. 27-28, 37, 130, 151). The confinement is one\nintended for segregation of the unruly and unmanageable inmate to try to get him to conform, as so many others\ndo, with the customs and regulations of the Facility. All experts agree that this type confinement is a necessity in\nprison administration.\nThere is a large outdoor recreation yard in the center of Unit 14, but access to that yard area is deemed a\n\"privilege\". The privilege of the outdoor yard is taken away for violations of the inmate while in Unit 14, for\nviolations such as refusing to shave, or refusing to wash eating utensils (R. 32, 144, 573, 697-700). The record of\nthis trial establishes that the open air exercise is withheld regularly, and that many Unit 14 inmates as a result are\nnever or for long periods of time afforded access to the outside yard. For example, on April 16, 1975, only seven\nout of the twenty-five in the Unit had ever been to the outside yard; two were in the segregated cell section for\nperiods of 272 and 329 days and have never been to the outside yard (P. Ex. 27). Born Allah testified that he was\n\nin Unit 14 for a year and never had been to the outside yard and he told in his own words the feeling he had\nwhen he had not been to yard for a year without sunshine, exercise or human contact (R. 34).\nThe position of the defendants sincerely offered as a satisfactory substitute is that the back door area of the cell\nprovides adequate exercise space for the Unit 14 inmates. However, I am satisfied from a fair preponderance of\nthe evidence, and it is my finding that the back door area is not of sufficient size nor physical makeup to provide\nadequate exercise space for individuals who are in cell confinement on many days, practically around-the-clock.\nThis finding is backed up by considerable testimony of the plaintiffs' experts in this regard, and further upon their\nconsensus that the lack of adequate outside yard exercise in the open air may inflict, depending on the strength\nof the individual, grave physical and psychological harm upon the inmate (R. 366, 478, 281, 729-731, 369-370). It\nwas emphasized by these experts that deprivation for long periods for minor infractions in segregation increases\ntension and instills a sense of helplessness and anger in the prisoners (Rubin 484, Rundle 374). All the experts\nhad no doubt that communal exercise and recreation for an hour a day was a must that should not be lightly\ntaken away, particularly during a prolonged isolated confinement (R. 384-385, 455, 736). Expert Goff termed a\ngood recreation program \"as much of a security feature as an armed gun tower\", and described recreation as a\nsafety valve (R. 273).\nIt is important to note that New York by its own Rule 7 NYCRR Chapter VI, Special Housing Unit, Section 301.5\n(b) seems to agree with the position of the experts.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, every inmate shall be permitted to exercise outside\nhis cell for at least one hour each day and where weather permits such exercise shall be permitted\nout of doors.\nSection 301.8 of NYCRR states:\nNo inmate is ever, under any circumstances, to be deprived of any item or activity required by the\nprovisions of this Part for the purpose of punishment or discipline.\nTo counter this explicit writing in the rules and regulations, the defense contention here is that the back door area\ncell with air able to blow in from the topside to a slight extent constitutes outdoor exercise in accord with the\nabove regulation (R. 577, 684). I am not so persuaded from the trial record made in this case and, this defense\ncontention, in the light of the testimony of inmates actually confined in the segregated area and the experts who\nviewed this back cell area, must be and is rejected as untenable and unacceptable. Unit 14 at Clinton is the only\nspecial housing unit in the state facilities, according to this trial record, that relies on this confined back door cell\n1369 area for exercise and recreation (R. 588-593). Severe criticism of this area, in colorful *1369 words at times, as\nsufficient to offer as a proper place for outdoor human exercise was given in their testimony by the experts (R.\n281-284, 730-731). As testified, and I so find, the back door cell is by no means outdoor exercise because there\nis no grass, no dirt, no rain (R. 453-454).\nOf course, I realize that as Circuit Judge Friendly noted some inmates in prison are not the most gentle and\ntractable of men. Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir. 1973). I realize and have always realized that\nthe inmates in segregation from my contact, with many prisoner cases, are usually the most troublesome and the\nmost difficult to handle. (See Defts. Ex. F, G; Ray v. Rockefeller, 352 F.Supp. 750,supra). All the experts in this\ntrial agreed that Special Housing and segregated confinement are necessary to maintain order and discipline in\nprisons, particularly with large populations. See Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178, 197 (2d Cir. 1971) (en banc), \ncert. den.,404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972). Further, I realize that prisoners at times must be\nexemplarily punished, and equally so in segregation, to deter the prisoner and others from breaking regulations\nthat are necessary for good order. LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974 at 978 (2d Cir. 1972),cert. den.,414\nU.S. 878, 94 S.Ct. 49, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973).\nWeighing the disastrous psychological and physical damage caused by prolonged deprivation for at least one\nhour a day from outdoor exercise, clearly proven in this record; the failure to follow the general rule for all special\nhousing units of the New York facilities; with no other facility having back door exercise cells (R. 584); the\nadmission that outdoor exercise periods can be regulated without interference with security; it is my specific\nfinding and conclusion that the practices and procedures in this regard, as shown by the record herein, are\n\nunreasonable and inhumane conditions of confinement, and constitute cruel and unusual punishment violative of\nthe Eighth Amendment. Again, there is reasoned and balanced opinion at the District Court level for the extent of\nthe conditions to be met to avoid such declaration of unconstitutionality in segregated confinement. See Spain v.\nProcunier, 408 F.Supp. 534, 545, 547 (N.D. Cal.1976)\n. In my judgment, without any inclination to write regulations for New York prisons, it would seem that as indicated\nin that opinion at page 547, a balanced regulation would be one that directs outdoor exercise for one hour per\nday in the yard at least for five days a week, weather permitting, unless the outdoor exercise is taken away for a\nperiod of fourteen days (my estimate) for serious infractions of the rules and regulations governing the\nsegregated Unit. This declaration is, of course, a serious federal intrusion into the management of a Special\nHousing Unit of a New York State prison but, in my judgment, after careful consideration, the declaration is\nwarranted and really compelled by the evidence in the trial record of this action.\nIII 00 ALLEGED FAILURE TO FOLLOW CONSTITUTIONAL DUE\n97\nPROCESS PROCEDURES IN DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\nWHEREIN PUNITIVE CONFINEMENT IS IMPOSED AS PUNISHMENT\nThis lengthy description is much more elaborate than the initial issue raised by the complaint herein, and is briefly\nsummarized as the (1) claim of the complaint in this action at Page 8. Attorney Richmond, nearing the end of the\ntrial, moved orally for the plaintiffs to amend the complaint to cover Superintendent Proceedings as\nconstitutionally challenged inasmuch as the complaint only challenged those of the adjustment committee\nprocedures. (R. 613-614, Def. Ex. D). Defendants' Exhibit D contains amendments to 7 NYCRR Parts 252 and\n253, effective May 19, 1975. This change necessitated the motion to amend that I granted from the Bench.\nAs happens often in these New York prison cases, several rulings of the federal courts, in my judgment, alleviate\nany problem relating to adjustment committee proceedings being unconstitutional under the rulings in Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), that set forth the due process requirements for\n1370 such *1370 procedures and hearings in disciplinary proceedings in the State prison setting. Crooks v. Warne, 516\nF.2d 837 at 839 (2d Cir. 1975) spelled out the procedures to be inaugurated: The notice of written charges, at\nleast 24 hours before the hearing, the right to call witnesses or present evidence in appropriate cases, and a\nstatement of reasons for any action taken. A later appeal by New York prison officials only challenged the district\ncourt order on the membership of the disciplinary committee, and the time an inmate can be held in segregation\nprior to hearing. See Powell v. Ward, 542 F.2d 101 (2d Cir. 1976). This last case, and the limited appeal taken\ndemonstrates as I have stated so often a commendable attitude and good judgment on the part of New York\nprison officials to follow willingly court rulings that are fair and subject to practical application.\nIn my judgment, the evidence produced in this case does not by a fair preponderance support the challenge that\nthe disciplinary proceedings in New York prisons are conducted unconstitutionally. The contention is that it may\nenter the federal constitutional area of deprivation and violation because the hearings are conducted in an\nextremely summary fashion. The Supreme Court in its writings pointed up these problems of conducting\nnumerous disciplinary proceedings in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974),\nand for that reason set forth with specificity the procedural minimal due process requirements it stated were \". . .\nconsonant with the unique institutional environment\". This approach and the limitation of due process\nrequirements were reiterated and clarified further in Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47\nL.Ed.2d 810 (1976). It is clear that the grievances claimed here by the plaintiffs involved questions of procedure\nthat are well within the sound discretion of the New York correction officials. A major complaint here is that there\nis no provision for a statement of the reasons for the disciplinary action taken by the hearing officer. But, 7\nNYCRR Section 253.4(i) does require a written statement setting forth the disposition and the evidence relied on.\nI do not perceive much difference in the result to be obtained by this wording and in any event the slight\ndifference, to my mind, does not present a question of federal constitutional stature. I find a failure of proof to\nsustain this claim. If New York in its management of prisons has to afford maximum of due process protections,\nthe prisons will soon turn into courts instead of being facilities for the confinement of persons lawfully convicted of\ncrime.\n\nIt is significant and important to note the high praise of Chief Judge Irving R. Kaufman of the Second Circuit,\nconcerning New York correction procedures governing discipline of inmates in United States ex rel. Haymes v.\nMontanye, 505 F.2d 977, 980-981 (1974),rev'd other grounds, sub nom. Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 96\nS.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466. This appraisal by Judge Kaufman, with a lengthy and notable experience in this field\nstated:\nIt is, of course, much to the credit of the New York correctional system that such thorough,\nspecific, and sensitive procedures have been codified to govern the enforcement of standards for\ninmate behavior. P. 981.\nFrom my own review of the evidence and regulations, reinforced by the above description, the claim of lack of\ndue process in the disciplinary procedures is dismissed for failure of proof to support that there exists thereunder\nfederal constitutional deprivations or violations.\nIV 00 DENIAL OF EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO THE COURTS INASMUCH\n97\nAS UNIT 14 INMATES ARE NOT ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE PRISON\nLAW LIBRARY, ONLY PROVIDED TWO LAW BOOKS PER DAY, AND\nNOT PERMITTED LEGAL ASSISTANCE FROM INMATES OR INMATE\nLAW CLERKS WHILE IN SEGREGATION\nTo merely set forth this above description of the issue, due to the long experience I have had with front line\n1371 observation for many years of complete freedom of *1371 access to this federal court by the State prisoners\nconfined in the three maximum security prisons here, and having had the responsibility to decide several\nimportant cases as noted that were filed and presented by experienced lawyers in behalf of Unit 14 inmates there\nprobably exists justification without further reason to rule that this claim in the complaint does not state a federal\nconstitutional claim cognizable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\nL.Ed.2d 251. The reality, of course, is that judicial notice can be taken from this case alone that there is\nevidenced no denial of this right from the filing of the complaint herein and the competent legal representation\nthat was accorded to Unit 14 inmates again in presenting fully their cause in this action to this Court. See Spain v.\nProcunier, 408 F.Supp., supra, at p. 546.\nThere is eye-opening testimony in this case, that should reassure many who worry about New York prison\nconditions, that New York provides the utmost and best in law library facilities and legal assistance for the\ninmates. The general library at Clinton contains about 1500 volumes with up-to-date state and federal reports,\ndigests and statutes (R. 85). The library is open 15 hours a week in the winter, and 30 hours in the summer, and\nthere is liberal access by the inmates to the library permitted. [Pl. Ex. 26, access to Int. 15(a), 15(b)]. The library\nis staffed by certified inmate law clerks, the recipients of extensive training courses, who assist other inmates to\nbecome proficient in legal research (R. 93). The succinct expression that should dispel any concern about\npossible deprivation along this line was the statement of Carter Benjamin, an employee of West Publishing\nCompany, who instituted and supervised the library program, that the New York prison law library program is \"the\nbest in the country\" R. 86.\nThe grievance here despite this program and well-stocked library is that the inmates when placed in Unit 14 are\nnot permitted to leave the segregation unit and go to the law library, and are only permitted to receive from the\nlibrary, upon request, two law books, that are delivered by the Unit 14 correction officers every other night, and\nthen picked up by the correction officers the following morning for return to the library (R. 50, 51-52, 166-167).\nThere is testimony in this record that the correction officials are not concerned about security or ability to\naccommodate if this restriction were relaxed. (Pl. Ex. 24, p. 14; Pl. Ex. 25, pp. 8-9). Carter Benjamin suggested\nUnit 14 inmates be allowed actual physical access to the law library in order to allow proper legal research (R.\n104).\n\nNo matter this testimony, it does not impress me that this custom of delivery of two law books to those placed in\nsegregation for punishment does not comply with constitutional standards. To direct or decree that access to the\nlaw library must be permitted would in effect diminish the purposes of the segregated confinement. Most\nimportantly, the fact that in New York State there is now a new Prisoners' Legal Services, with a substantial\nnumber of lawyers, located in Plattsburgh to service Clinton; in Albany to service Great Meadow; and in Syracuse\nto service Auburn, does provide every human assurance possible that Unit 14 inmates, with possibly worthy\nconstitutional claims, will have those claims considered for court presentation. It is just ludicrous with this\nelaborate service program to think otherwise. There is and always has been complete freedom of mailing allowed\nby Unit 14 inmates to courts and to any attorney or legal service organization.\nThe federal courts interfere only when there is shown serious prohibitions against or lack of facilities in state\nprisons for legal research, and there are no alternatives for the prisoner to obtain legal assistance. Johnson v.\nAvery, 393 U.S. 483, 490, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969); Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F.Supp. 105\n(N.D.Cal.1970)aff'd sub nom. Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971); Procunier\nv. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 419-422, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); Bryan v. Werner, 516 F.2d 233 (3d Cir.\n1372 1975); see also Smith v. Bounds, 538 F.2d *1372 541 (4th Cir. 1975),cert. gr., 425 U.S. 910, 96 S.Ct. 1505, 47\nL.Ed.2d 760 (1976). The situations that might provide a basis for federal constitutional challenge on an issue of\nthis kind are not proven here to exist in any degree. There is clearly no constitutional stature to this claim under\nthe evidence presented. In fact, to the contrary, the evidence indicates, as does the representation in the\npreparation of pleadings and preparation and presentation at this trial, that Unit 14 inmates are well serviced\nlegally, and have unhampered access to the courts. This claim is denied and dismissed for failure of proof.\nIn conclusion, I want to strike the same note I began with. I treat these cases as among the most serious a\nfederal judge encounters. The extensive writings in the federal courts at every level in these cases are the best\nevidence of the burdens imposed by them upon the federal court system. We deal with the most tense human\nrelationship that exists, with the risk always apparent to me that injudicious writings and decrees might inflame\nthe tension, and unintentionally be the cause of prison riots. The federal courts, in my judgment, must adhere\nreligiously to the caution that their only jurisdiction is to entertain claims from state prisoners that possess, at\nleast arguably, claims of federal constitutional substance. Otherwise, the federal judges should be content to\nleave the solution and consideration of the commonplace gripes about prison life to state executives, and\nlegislative and administrative bodies. See Spain v. Procunier, 408 F.Supp., supra, at p. 537. Second Circuit Judge\nVan Graafeiland has again expressed recently his \"concern about excessive involvement by the federal courts in\nthe operation of state penal institutions.\" Zurak et al. v. Regan et al., ___ F.2d ___ at ___, decided February 7,\n1977 (Van Graafeiland, C. J. dissenting); see also Judicial Restraint, the best medicine, Third Circuit Judge Arlin\nM. Adams, Judicature, Vol. 60, p. 179, Nov. 1976. It is my state of mind from a vantage point that brings every\nday contact with state prisons and prisoners and from the experience gained from observation of a substantial\nnumber of inmates who appeared before me that there has been no evidence of mistreatment or\nundernourishment. The inmates who testified in this trial without any fear of retaliation, Born Allah and Hiney,\nwere well dressed in civilian clothes, with all appearances that indicated good health. Each stated at the end of\nthe trial that they were satisfied with the conduct of the trial and the presentation of the case. R. 759-760. New\nYork State should not be too quickly condemned for failure to provide adequate funds for prison operations\nbecause, as I recall, the proposed budget appropriation for the fiscal year 1977-1978 requested by Governor\nCarey is in the substantial sum of Two Hundred and Forty-Six Million Dollars, an increase of 31.9 million over the\nprevious fiscal year.\nAn appropriate decree in accordance herewith shall be submitted by the attorneys for the plaintiffs in relation to\nthe two claims of the complaint upheld, and incorporating an order dismissing the other two claims as ruled\nherein. The decree and order, if not consented to shall be settled on three days notice. The exhibits shall be filed\nwith the Clerk of the Court for delivery at their request to the attorneys who offered such exhibits. See General\nRule 18, N.D.N.Y.\nIt is so Ordered.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

It is alleged that during this period,\n[1]\nplaintiffs were held in Clinton's Special Housing Unit 14 (\"SHU\" or \"Unit 14\"),  a unit in which inmates were\nseparated from the institution's general population for punitive purposes, as a result of findings made at\nAdjustment Committee Proceedings which were conducted in violation of their procedural due process rights.\nPlaintiffs also claim that they were subjected to the use of excessive force by prison guards in the years in\nquestion, that prison officials routinely conducted body cavity searches of plaintiffs in violation of their\nconstitutional rights, and that the conditions within Unit 14 violated the eighth amendment's prohibition of cruel\nand unusual punishments. Compensatory and punitive damages are sought. Plaintiffs have also requested\ndeclaratory relief, but because plaintiffs are no longer housed in Unit 14 and because the policies of 1974 and\n1975 that are challenged here are no longer in effect, such relief is unavailable in this case. See Socialist Labor\nParty v. Gilligan, 406 U.S. 583, 585, 92 S.Ct. 1716, 1717, 32 L.Ed.2d 317 (1972). Three of the plaintiffs named in\nthe caption have discontinued their claims with prejudice. A nonjury trial of the claims of the remaining three\nplaintiffs 00 Zachary Morgan, Born-Allah, and Phillip Goggins 00 was conducted July 13-15, 1987. The following\n97 97\nconstitutes the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with the mandate of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52\n(a).\nI. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs were confined in Unit 14 during a period of serious unrest in the New York prison system in the wake of\nthe 1971 uprising at the State's Attica Correctional Facility (\"Attica\"). Each of the plaintiffs were placed in SHU\nafter Superintendent's Proceedings that the parties agree comported with the requirements of due process.\nPlaintiff Zachary Morgan had been transferred from Attica to Clinton on February 1, 1974 to serve 45 days in Unit\n\n1031 14; *1031 plaintiff Born-Allah was initially sentenced to 60 days in SHU for the failure to obey an order and was\nplaced in Unit 14 on April 2, 1974; plaintiff Phillip Goggins was ordered confined to SHU for seven days\ncommencing January 27, 1974 after he had become embroiled in a dispute with another inmate and a Clinton\ncorrectional officer. Morgan would remain confined in SHU until his transfer to the Green Meadow Correctional\nFacility on September 7, 1975, a total of 584 days, only 225 of which are attributable to findings made at\nSuperintendent's Proceedings. Born-Allah was housed in Unit 14 for 357 days, only 60 of which are traceable to\na Superintendent's Proceeding. Goggins was held in SHU for 213 days, only the initial seven of which were\nmandated by a determination made after a Superintendent's Proceeding.\nPlaintiffs maintain that they were retained in Unit 14 beyond the periods established in Superintendent's\nProceedings in violation of their due process rights protected by the fourteenth amendment. Plaintiffs argue that\nthey were falsely accused of violating prison rules in some instances and were written up for frivolous infractions\nin others by the defendant correctional officers. These disciplinary reports were referred to Clinton's Adjustment\nCommittees, which conducted less formal factual inquiries than were made in Superintendent's Proceedings.\nPlaintiffs claim they were not given advance notice of the charges made by correctional officers before plaintiffs\nwere required to appear before the Adjustment Committees, that they were not given an adequate opportunity to\npresent evidence concerning the charges levelled against them, and that the Adjustment Committee Proceedings\nwere conducted in a summary manner. As a result of these proceedings, plaintiffs were commonly sanctioned for\ntheir alleged misdeeds by having their period of confinement in SHU extended for as many as fourteen days (so-\n[2]\ncalled \"keeplock\" confinement).  In 1974 and 1975, the Adjustment Committees had the discretionary power to\nextend keeplock for successive fourteen day periods.\nPlaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah also testified that during the time they were housed in SHU they were subjected\nto abusive and demeaning treatment by the correctional officers named as defendants in this case. For example,\nplaintiff Morgan attested that prison guards would not allow him to shower unless he \"barked like a dog;\" Morgan\nand Born-Allah both stated that the correctional officers would place tags with the names of animals on them over\nthe inmates' cells, implying that the prisoners were akin to animals in a zoo; plaintiffs testified that they were\nforcibly subjected to unnecessary strip searches; and plaintiffs allege that Clinton's correctional officers\ncommonly sprayed tear gas into their faces under circumstances not warranting the use of tear gas. In addition,\neach of the plaintiffs complain of separate incidents where excessive force was allegedly applied to them by\nClinton's guards. This action was commenced on July 15, 1975.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\nInitially, the court must address defendants' contention that plaintiffs' claims for damages relating to the alleged\nprocedural deficiencies of Clinton's Adjustment Committee Proceedings are barred by the eleventh amendment.\n[3]\n The eleventh amendment provides that \"[t]he Judicial Power of the United States shall not be construed to\nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of\n1032 another State or Citizens or Subjects of any *1032 Foreign State.\" U.S. Const. amend. XI. The Supreme Court\nhas found that the amendment's \"greater significance lies in its affirmation that the fundamental principle of\nsovereign immunity limits the grant of judicial authority\" in Article III of the Constitution. Pennhurst State School\nand Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98, 104 S.Ct. 900, 906, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (\"Pennhurst II\").\nConsequently, the amendment's prohibition has been broadened to cover suits against a state by one of its own\ncitizens, Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 15, 10 S.Ct. 504, 507, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890), as well as suits in which a\nstate is not named but \"is the party in fact.\" Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1687, 40\n[4]\nL.Ed.2d 90 (1974); see also Pennhurst II, 465 U.S. at 101, 104 S.Ct. at 908.  For example, an action for\ndamages cannot be maintained against a state official in his official capacity, since a judgment in such an action\nwould \"impose[] liability on the entity that [the official] represents....\" Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 169, 105\nS.Ct. 3099, 3107, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (quotation omitted).\n\nOn the other hand, the eleventh amendment does not preclude damage claims against a state official accused of\ndepriving another of a federal right under the color of state law notwithstanding the fact that the official holds\npublic office, so long as the money sought is to come out of the official's own pocket. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416\nU.S. at 237-38, 94 S.Ct. at 1686-87; Farid v. Smith, 850 F.2d 917, 921 (2d Cir. 1988). Consequently, when a state\nofficial is named as a defendant in a lawsuit, the court must determine whether the claim is made against that\nofficial in his personal capacity or his official capacity. See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. at 165-68, 105 S.Ct. at\n3104-06; Shabazz v. Coughlin, 852 F.2d 697, 700 (2d Cir.1988). The caption of the complaint in this action does\nnot indicate in what capacity defendants are being sued. The court finds that defendants have been sued in their\npersonal capacity. The complaint's demand for money damages, as well as defendants' assertion of qualified\nimmunity to liability under ยง 1983, which is a personal immunity defense, is evidence that defendants were aware\nthat plaintiffs sought to impose personal liability upon them for the constitutional violations with which they are\n[5]\naccused. See Shabazz v. Coughlin, 852 F.2d at 700.\nWith regard to the procedural due process claims, defendants argue that they were carrying out the policies of\nthe State of New York, and thus (it is implied) this action must be deemed an official-capacity suit. Support for this\ncontention is found in Jones v. Smith, 784 F.2d 149, 152 (2d Cir.1986). In the more recent case of Farid v. Smith,\nhowever, the Second Circuit rejected any suggestion that might be contained in Jones to the effect that a state\nofficial was immune from personal liability for carrying out a state policy that violated federal law. 850 F.2d at 923.\nIn Farid, Judge Pierce examined the history of the Supreme Court's interpretation of a state's sovereign immunity\nand found the Court's decisions are consistent with the maxim that \"`an agent's liability for torts committed by him\ncannot be avoided by pleading the direction or authorization of the principal.'\" Id. at 921 (quoting Pennhurst II,\n465 U.S. at 113 n. 23, 104 S.Ct. at 915 n. 23). Judge Pierce noted that although the Supreme Court has moved\naway from agency principles in analyzing the eleventh amendment in recent years and instead has focused on\n1033 federalism concerns, this development *1033 did not undermine the vitality of the Court's older cases discussed\nin Farid. Judge Pierce noted that \"the need to reconcile competing interests [of federal and state law] is wholly\nabsent when a plaintiff, alleging that a state official in carrying out state policy has violated federal law, institutes a\nfederal personal-capacity action against the state official,\" since \"only the federal interest in the supremacy of\nfederal law is implicated, because the state treasury is not at risk.\" 850 F.2d at 923. In light of the discussion\ncontained in Farid, the court rejects defendants' eleventh amendment argument.\nB. Res Judicata\nDefendants also claim that many of plaintiffs' claims are precluded under the doctrines of res judicata and\ncollateral estoppel. In 1973, a class action was commenced in this court under ยง 1983 by inmates housed in SHU\n[6]\nchallenging certain prison regulations and practices. Declaratory and injunctive relief  was sought in that action;\nno demand for money damages was made. In December 1974, the Honorable James T. Foley, then Chief Judge\nof the Northern District of New York, certified a class consisting of the inmates housed in Unit 14. At that time,\nplaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah 00 but not plaintiff Goggins 00 were members of this class. On February 17, 1977\n97 97\nChief Judge Foley issued a memorandum-decision and order disposing of the claims raised in that action. Frazier\nv. Ward, 426 F.Supp. 1354, 1356 (N.D.N.Y. 1977). In that decision, Judge Foley held, among other things, that\nthe manner in which Adjustment Committee Proceedings were conducted at Clinton, at least after amendments\nto the regulations governing those proceedings became effective May 19, 1975, satisfied the mandates of due\nprocess. Id. at 1369-70. Clinton's policy of requiring strip searches before inmates confined in SHU were allowed\ncontact with visitors, however, was found violative of those inmates' constitutional rights. Id. at 1362-67.\nThe case at bar was commenced after the certification of the class in Frazier and before Judge Foley rendered\nhis decision in 1977. Shortly before trial on this matter was commenced, defendants moved for the dismissal of\nall of plaintiffs' claims not predicated on the allegations concerning excessive use of force on the ground that they\n[7]\nwere barred by the doctrine of res judicata.  The court reserved decision on defendants' motion at that time,\nand proceeded with the trial. The court now finds that plaintiff Goggins' claims are not barred by either res\njudicata or collateral estoppel because he was not a member of the class certified in Frazier. The claims of\nplaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah are not precluded by the doctrine of res judicata because those plaintiffs were\n\nnot notified that their membership in the Frazier class would foreclose subsequent individual actions for damages\narising out of the constitutional violations that were raised or could have been raised in Frazier. Collateral\nestoppel does not bar the claims of Morgan and Born-Allah because the issues actually decided in Frazier are\nnot identical to those raised in the present case.\n[8]\nThe doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel  are intended to ensure the conclusiveness of the\njudgments of judicial tribunals and thus allow the accomplishment of \"the very object for which civil courts have\n1034 been established, which is *1034 to secure the peace and repose of society by the settlement of matters capable\nof judicial determination.\" Southern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 168 U.S. 1, 49, 18 S.Ct. 18, 27, 42 L.Ed. 355\n(1897). Once a final judgment has been entered on the merits of an action, the doctrine of res judicata (claim\npreclusion) mandates that that judgment be \"`a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding\nparties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or\ndefeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that\npurpose.'\" Nevada v. United States, 463 U.S. 110, 129-30, 103 S.Ct. 2906, 2917-18, 77 L.Ed.2d 509 (1983)\n(quoting Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U.S. 351, 352, 24 L.Ed. 195 (1877)); see also Herendeen v. Champion\nInternational Corp., 525 F.2d 130, 133-34 (2d Cir.1975). The doctrine of collateral estoppel (issue preclusion)\nprevents \"relitigation of issues actually litigated\" in a prior adjudication, provided resolution of that issue was\nnecessary to the prior controversy and the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was a party to the prior\ncontroversy. Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979); Parklane\nHosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 326 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 645, 649 n. 5, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979).\nUnder these estoppel by judgment doctrines, the general rule is that at least some preclusive effect must be\ngiven to previous judicial determinations made in cases seeking declaratory relief. See, e.g., Nevada v. United\nStates, 463 U.S. at 110, 103 S.Ct. at 2906. Moreover, it is well-established that \"a judgment in a properly\nentertained class action is binding on class members in any subsequent litigation,\" and that in such cases \"[b]asic\nprinciples of res judicata ... and collateral estoppel ... apply.\" Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467\nU.S. 867, 874, 104 S.Ct. at 2794, 2798, 81 L.Ed.2d 718 (1984). Nonetheless, the preclusive effect to be given a\nfinal judgment in a class action in which only declaratory relief was pursued is subject to certain limitations. These\nlimitations are necessitated first, by the circumscribed relief ordinarily obtainable in class actions seeking a\n[9]\ndeclaratory judgment,  and second, by the due process problems raised when the judgment preclusion\ndoctrines are applied to class members who were unaware that their membership in the class could foreclose\nsubsequent actions to recover money damages.\nDue process considerations prevent the application of res judicata or collateral estoppel to the claims of plaintiff\nGoggins. As a general rule, \"due process require[s] that, where possible, a person should be notified of the\nexistence of a lawsuit before he is bound by a judgment in that lawsuit.\" Berry Petroleum Co. v. Adams & Peck,\n518 F.2d 402, 412 (2d Cir.1975) (citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 173-75, 94 S.Ct. 2140,\n2150-51, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974), and Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652,\n94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)). For class actions, this requirement is ordinarily fulfilled through the notice provisions of Fed.\nR.Civ.P. 23(c) and (d). Such notice is usually not provided, however, until after certification of a proposed class. In\nthe Frazier action, Goggins had left the class as defined before certification of the plaintiff class was obtained,\nand therefore cannot be bound by the disposition of the claims made in that case.\nDefendants Morgan and Born-Allah, however, were members of the class as certified by Judge Foley in\nDecember 1974; indeed, defendant Born-Allah testified at the trial on the merits in Frazier. See426 F.Supp. at\n1035 1372. Nonetheless, the court finds that the individual claims made by these defendants in this case are not *1035\nbarred by the doctrine of res judicata. There is authority to the effect that \"before a class member may be barred\nfrom pursuing an individual claim for damages, he must have been notified that he was required to adjudicate his\ndamage claims as part of a prior class action suit.\" Crowder v. Lash, 687 F.2d 996, 1008 (7th Cir.1982); see also \nWright v. Collins, 766 F.2d 841, 847-49 (4th Cir.1985); Norris v. Slothouber, 718 F.2d 1116, 1117 (D.C.Cir.1983); \nPenson v. Terminal Transport Co., 634 F.2d 989, 995 (5th Cir.1981). The record does not indicate that any such\n[10]\nnotice was given defendants Morgan and Born-Allah.  Moreover, a number of circuit courts, including our own\nSecond Circuit, have specifically held that prison inmates are not precluded from pursuing claims for damages\nresulting from allegedly unconstitutional prison conditions by an earlier judgment in a class action in which only\n\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief was pursued. Wright, 766 F.2d at 847-49; Crowder, 687 F.2d at 1007-09; Bogard v.\nCook, 586 F.2d 399, 408-09 (5th Cir.1978),cert. denied,444 U.S. 883, 100 S.Ct. 173, 62 L.Ed.2d 113 (1979); \nCotton v. Hutto, 577 F.2d 453, 454 (8th Cir.1978); Jones-Bey v. Caso, 535 F.2d 1360, 1361-62 (2d Cir.1976).\nIn most of the above-cited cases, the plaintiff class had prevailed in the prior class action for declaratory relief,\nand individual plaintiffs were then permitted to pursue claims for damages resulting from the constitutional\ndeprivations that were the subject of the class action. The argument for affording a judgment in a class action for\ndeclaratory relief preclusive effect would seem stronger where the plaintiff class did not prevail on its\nconstitutional claims. In such cases, if claim preclusion is denied, a defendant who had been vindicated in a prior\nsuit could be subjected to a second lawsuit involving the same core of operative facts. This does not, however,\nappear to be a determining consideration. In Wright, the Fourth Circuit appears to have assumed that a district\ncourt had rejected a constitutional claim by a plaintiff class, see766 F.2d at 847-48, but found that an individual\nclass member's subsequent action for damages based on the same constitutional theory was not barred by the\nres judicata doctrine because that individual \"was not notified that participation in the class action would preclude\na subsequent individual damage action.\" Id. at 848. In reaching this conclusion the court quoted the Seventh\nCircuit's observation that it would be inappropriate\nto require an inmate to elect between joining an ongoing class suit and thereby forfeiting his right\nto seek individual damages, on the one hand, and removing himself from the class (and hence\nrisking exclusion from any equitable relief granted) in order to preserve the possibility of bringing a\nsubsequent damage action, on the other.\nCrowder, 687 F.2d at 1009 (quoted in Wright, 766 F.2d at 848). Under this rationale, the success or failure of the\nplaintiff class in the prior class action would be irrelevant to the propriety of precluding a subsequent damage\naction by an individual class member on the same constitutional claim. Accordingly, the court must find that the\nclaims of defendants Morgan and Born-Allah are not precluded as a result of the adverse decision rendered in \nFrazier.\nAlthough a class member who is not given proper notice of the potential effect of a judgment rendered in a class\naction for declaratory relief is not barred from bringing a subsequent action for damages by the res judicata\ndoctrine, that class member can be precluded from relitigating an issue decided adversely to him in the class\naction. Crowder, 687 F.2d at 1009-11 & n. 10. An issue necessarily decided in an action for equitable relief can\nhave collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent action for damages. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 335, 99 S.Ct.\nat 653. Moreover, the sort of due process problem raised when an individual is bound to an election of remedies\nhe did not knowingly make 00 which would be the result if a class member is precluded from pursuing money\n97\n1036 damages by failing to opt out of the class when he *1036 had no notice that such a bar would result from his\nmembership in the class 00 is not present when that individual is bound by factual determinations made in the\n97\nprior class action. Where, as was the case in Frazier, the class was adequately represented, the representatives\nof the class had every incentive to press their claims vigorously, and adequate \"procedural opportunities\" were\navailable to the individual class member in the prior class action, there are no strong equitable considerations\n[11]\npreventing the application of collateral estoppel. Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 332, 99 S.Ct. at 652.\nIn determining whether plaintiffs are precluded from pursuing any of the claims they have made in the present\naction because of an adverse finding in the prior class action, a three-pronged inquiry must be made:\n[F]irst, whether the issues presented by this litigation are in substance the same as those resolved\nagainst the [plaintiffs in the previous action]; second, whether controlling facts or legal principles\nhave changed significantly since the [previous] judgment; and finally, whether other special\ncircumstances warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion.\nMontana v. United States, 440 U.S. at 155, 99 S.Ct. at 974. The factual and legal determinations made by Judge\nFoley in Frazier for which preclusive effect is sought primarily involve plaintiffs' procedural due process claims.\nBecause the issues resolved in Judge Foley's decision cannot be regarded as substantively identical to the\nclaims made in the present action, the court finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to the\n[12]\nfindings made regarding disciplinary procedures.\n\nIn Frazier, Judge Foley ruled that the plaintiff class had failed to demonstrate that the disciplinary proceedings\nconducted at Clinton in 1977 violated their due process rights. 426 F.Supp. at 1369-70. Because the plaintiff class\nsought only prospective relief, Judge Foley did not address the adequacy of the procedures that were in effect in\n1974 and the first half of 1975, the time period relevant to the present action. Effective May 19, 1975, the\nregulations governing New York's prison disciplinary proceedings were amended. Prior to that date, an inmate\n[13]\ncould be confined in a special housing unit or segregation unit  as a result of conclusions drawn after either\nAdjustment Committee Proceedings or Superintendent's Proceedings. As a result of the May 19, 1975\namendment, a correctional institution's Adjustment Committees were \"deprived ... of the power to confine an\ninmate to a special housing unit without an immediate recommendation that a Superintendent's Proceeding be\nconvened.\" See Powell v. Ward, 643 F.2d 924, 928 n. 2 (2d Cir.) (per curiam) (Powell II), cert. denied,454 U.S.\n1037 832, 102 S.Ct. 131, 70 L.Ed. 2d 111 (1981).[14] This is a significant *1037 change, because plaintiffs in the\npresent action do not contend that the procedural protections afforded at the Superintendent's Proceedings\nconducted in 1974 and 1975 failed to satisfy due process requirements. The focus of their due process attack is\ninstead the Adjustment Committee Proceedings. The question raised in the present action is whether the\nextension of an inmate's period of confinement in special housing after an Adjustment Committee Proceeding\nconducted pursuant to regulations as they existed in 1974 and 1975 00 without the benefit of the adequate post-\n97\ndeprivation hearing that was supposedly provided after May 1975 by a Superintendent's Proceeding 00 comported\n97\nwith due process. Judge Foley did not address this issue in Frazier, and thus his disposition of the procedural due\nprocess claim in that case does not preclude plaintiffs' due process claims made in the present action.\nJudge Foley also ruled that the limitations placed on the access of SHU inmates to library resources did not deny\nthem effective access to the courts. 426 F.Supp. at 1370-72. Plaintiffs protested these limitations in their\ncomplaint, but did not present proof regarding this issue at trial. Therefore, it is unnecessary to determine\nwhether plaintiffs should be bound by Judge Foley's resolution of that claim. An argument could be made that\npreclusive effect should be given to Judge Foley's determination that the body cavity searches routinely\nconducted by Clinton guards before and after inmates housed in SHU visited individuals from outside the prison\nviolated the fourth and eighth amendments. Collateral estoppel has not been pressed by plaintiffs, however, and\n[15]\nthe burden would be placed upon them to demonstrate that the doctrine applies in this case.  Because neither\nres judicata nor collateral estoppel apply in the case at bar, the court turns to the merits of plaintiffs' claims.\nC. The Due Process Claims\n1. The Adjustment Committee Proceedings\nAs a general rule, the resolution of a procedural due process claim requires a determination of whether the\nplaintiff was deprived of a constitutionally protected interest and, if so, whether the procedures used were\nadequate given the nature of the deprivation contemplated. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 428,\n102 S.Ct. 1148, 1153, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982); Farid, 850 F.2d at 924. It is now well established that in New York,\nwhen an inmate who was properly placed in a special housing unit for disciplinary reasons is kept in that unit\nbeyond his initial sentence because of additional disciplinary charges, he has suffered a significant deprivation of\na protected liberty interest created by state law. See McCann v. Coughlin, 698 F.2d 112, 121-22 (2d Cir.1983).\nConsequently, due process requires that certain minimal procedural protections be afforded in order to assure a\nmore reliable evaluation of the factual basis of the additional charges made and a fairer determination of the\npunishment warranted by the inmate's behavior. See, e.g., Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 470-72, 103 S.Ct. 864,\n870-72, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-57, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974-75, 41 L.Ed.2d\n935 (1974); Sher v. Coughlin, 739 F.2d 77, 81 (2d Cir.1984).\nTo determine the specific requirements of due process in a particular case, a court must consider the interest of\nthe private individual at issue, the risk that an erroneous deprivation of the private interest will occur because of\nthe procedures being used, the benefits that might result from additional or alternative procedural safeguards,\nand the governmental interests, including fiscal and administrative concerns, that are implicated. Mathews v.\n1038 Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 *1038 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). In Wolff v. McDonnell, the Supreme\n\nCourt balanced the interests at stake when a prisoner faces disciplinary charges that can result in significant\ndeprivations of liberty interests. The Court decided that in such cases the inmate must be provided a hearing\nconducted by a fair and impartial factfinder on the charges levied against him and is entitled to be informed in\nwriting of those charges at least twenty-four hours before that hearing. 418 U.S. at 563-64, 94 S.Ct. at 2978-79; \nid.418 U.S. at 581, 94 S.Ct. at 2987 (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The inmate must be\nallowed to present evidence and call witnesses in his defense if this can be done without imperilling institutional\nsafety or legitimate correctional objectives. Id. at 566, 94 S.Ct. at 2979. Further, he must be informed of the\nreasons for the actions taken against him as a result of the disposition of the disciplinary charges by the factfinder\nand the evidence relied upon by the factfinder in reaching its decision. Id. at 563-65, 94 S.Ct. at 2978-79; see\nalso McCann, 698 F.2d at 121-22. Plaintiffs maintain they were not afforded these basic procedural safeguards in\nhearings that resulted in the extension of their confinement in SHU.\nDuring the period of time relevant to this lawsuit, the two major types of disciplinary proceedings conducted in\nNew York correctional facilities were Superintendent's Proceedings and Adjustment Committee Proceedings. 7\n[16]\nN.Y.C.R.R. Parts 252, 253.  Superintendent's Proceedings were wholly disciplinary in purpose, 7 N.Y.C.R.R. ยง\n[17]\n253.1, and plaintiffs do not challenge the procedural adequacy of those Proceedings.  In contrast, prison\n[18]\nofficials considered Adjustment Committee Proceedings  to be less formal hearings designed to aid an\ninmate's \"understanding of and adherence to\" the institution's rules governing his behavior; the Adjustment\nCommittees were not to \"impos[e] punishment for a violation\" of those rules. 7 N.Y.C.R.R. ยง 252.5(a) & (b); see \nPowell II, 643 F.2d at 928 n. 2; Powell v. Ward, 392 F.Supp. 628, 629 (S.D.N.Y.1975) (Powell I), aff'd as modified,\n542 F.2d 101 (2d Cir. 1976). The Committees were vested with primary responsibility for ascertaining the facts\nand circumstances of alleged incidents of inmate misbehavior in the prisons of the State of New York, and were\ncharged with taking \"appropriate steps to secure future compliance\" with institutional rules. 7 N.Y.C.R.R. ยง 252.2\n(c). Corrections officials apparently believed that the \"steps\" the Adjustment Committees were permitted to take\nimplicated comparatively minor private interests, and consequently the procedural safeguards associated with the\nSuperintendent's Proceedings, much less those mandated by Wolff, were not provided by authorities at Clinton\nwhen an inmate appeared before that institution's Adjustment Committees.\nClinton officials misperceived the magnitude of the deprivations that could result from determinations by its\nAdjustment Committees. If deemed \"necessary in order to bring the behavior of the inmate within acceptable\nlimits,\" a Committee could continue an inmate's confinement in SHU for a period as long as fourteen days, and it\ncould do this on successive occasions. Id. ยง 252.5(e). In the case at bar, Clinton's Committees regularly extended\n1039 plaintiffs' period of confinement in SHU for successive seven day periods. This power was *1039 exercised\nwithout routinely giving inmates written notice of the charges they faced in the Adjustment Committee\nProceedings or providing inmates written findings when the Committee decided to continue punitive confinement.\nPlaintiffs testified that they did not believe that they could, under certain circumstances, call witnesses to testify at\nthese hearings. In McCann, the Second Circuit conclusively determined that the procedural safeguards set out in \nWolff must be provided to an inmate who faces the prospect of being sentenced to additional time in a punitive\nspecial housing unit beyond the sentence established after a Superintendent's Proceeding. 698 F.2d at 121.\nSince those safeguards were not provided plaintiffs in 1974 and 1975, the court concludes that plaintiffs\nprocedural due process rights were infringed when keeplock was imposed for successive seven day periods\npursuant to the discretionary authority of Clinton's Adjustment Committees.\n2. Good Faith Immunity\nHaving determined that the manner in which the Adjustment Committee Proceedings were conducted in 1974\nand 1975 violated plaintiffs' procedural due process rights, the court must determine whether defendants are\nentitled to immunity from civil damages in this ยง 1983 action. Generally speaking, state officials, including state\nprison officials, see Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. 555, 561-62, 98 S.Ct. 855, 859-60, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978),\nare shielded from liability under ยง 1983 \"insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818,\n102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed. 2d 396 (1982); see also Anderson v. Creighton, ___ U.S. ___, 107 S.Ct. 3034,\n3038, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); Shabazz v. Coughlin, 852 F.2d at 700. On the other hand, if the constitutional or\n\nstatutory law at issue was clearly established at the time it was violated, the state official who violated it is not,\nabsent extraordinary circumstances, protected by the qualified immunity defense. Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818-19,\n102 S.Ct. at 2738-39; Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 68 (2d Cir.1988).\nPlaintiff Morgan was held in Unit 14 between February 1974 and September 1975. With the exception of the\ninitial 45 days of this confinement and three separate 60 day periods commencing in August 1974, January 1975,\nand April 1975, Morgan's confinement in SHU resulted from determinations made at Adjustment Committee\nProceedings. Plaintiff Born-Allah was placed in SHU in April 1974 and remained there until the end of March\n1975; all but the initial 60 days of this time was mandated by Clinton's Adjustment Committees. Plaintiff Goggins\nwas housed in SHU between January and August 1974, and only the first week of that time is not attributable to\nan Adjustment Committee determination. In order to resolve defendants' qualified immunity argument, the court\nmust determine whether the Adjustment Committee procedures offended due process principles that were\n\"clearly established\" at any point during the periods in which plaintiffs were housed in Unit 14.\nThe Second Circuit did not decide the exact issue presented in the present case until 1983, when it handed down\nits decision in McCann. Nonetheless, the lack of \"specific authority directly on point\" in 1974 and 1975 does not\nabsolutely \"preclude a finding that the law was clearly established.\" Shabazz, 852 F.2d at 701; see also Weber v.\nDell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987). Although\nprison officials have no duty to \"anticipate future developments in the field of inmates' due process rights,\" they\ncannot restrict their reading of previously decided cases \"to the particular facts presented to the court in those\ncases, and claim that the details of the present situation are different in some minor or insignificant way.\" \nMcCann, 698 F.2d at 125. In McCann, the Second Circuit rejected the contention that prison officials were\nentitled to good faith immunity for due process violations found to have occurred in Adjustment Committee\n1040 Proceedings conducted in New York's Fishkill Correctional Center in *1040 1979. Id. at 124-25.[19] In McKinnon\nv. Patterson, 568 F.2d 930 (2d Cir.1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 1087, 98 S.Ct. 1282, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978), the\ncourt found that the Wolff procedures applied when an inmate was to be restricted to his cell in general\npopulation for punitive purposes (a punishment similar to but probably less severe than that at issue in McCann),\nbut refused to permit damages for the failure to provide these procedures in 1973, before Wolff had been\ndecided, because at that time \"the contours of prisoners' procedural rights were just starting to take shape.\" 568\nF.2d at 934-35. The question here is whether principles that were unclear in 1973 but crystallized by 1979 were\n\"clearly established\" in 1974 or 1975.\nThe court begins by noting that the leading prisoners' due process case in this Circuit before Wolff was Sostre v.\nMcGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir.1971) (en banc), cert. denied,404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 &\n405 U.S. 978, 92 S.Ct. 1190, 31 L.Ed.2d 254 (1972). The key passage in that opinion concerning the procedural\ndue process requirements for prison disciplinary actions was as follows:\nIf substantial deprivations are to be visited upon a prisoner, it is wise that such action should at\nleast be premised on facts rationally determined. This is not a concept without meaning. In most\ncases it would probably be difficult to find an inquiry minimally fair and rational unless the prisoner\nwere confronted with the accusation, informed of the evidence against him, and afforded a\nreasonable opportunity to explain his actions.\nId. at 198 (citations omitted). This is precisely the process provided plaintiffs at the Adjustment Committee\nProceedings in 1974 and 1975. At that time, an inmate was given oral notice of the charges against him at the\nhearing, advised of the evidence supporting the charges, and given an opportunity to contest the allegation or\nexplain his behavior. The court concludes that the Adjustment Committee Proceedings satisfied Sostre.\nOn June 26, 1974 the Supreme Court issued its decision in Wolff. The Court implicitly found that the procedural\nsafeguards contemplated by Sostre were not sufficient when serious deprivations for disciplinary infractions were\ncontemplated, see418 U.S. at 563-72 & 572 n. 20, 94 S.Ct. at 2978-82, & 2982 n. 20, and prescribed the\nrequirements described above. See text, supra at 1037-38. Wolff involved sanctions such as the loss of good\nbehavior time and solitary confinement. The Court noted, however, that \"the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause does not\nrequire a hearing `in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest,'\" 418 U.S. at 557, 94\nS.Ct. at 2975 (quoting Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 894, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230\n\n(1961)), and explained that it did not intend to intimate that the procedures that must be followed when the loss of\ngood time (which effectively extended an inmate's actual period of incarceration) or the imposition of solitary\nconfinement were threatened are the same as would \"be required for the imposition of lesser penalties such as\nthe loss of privileges.\" Id.418 U.S. at 571 n. 19, 94 S.Ct. at 2982 n. 19. New York's prison officials apparently\nbelieved that the extension of keeplock in SHU for a period not exceeding fourteen days was the sort of \"lesser\npenalty\" contemplated by Wolff's footnote 19. If so, this belief was not objectively reasonable.\nBefore the Supreme Court's decision in Wolff, there was substantial authority both within this Circuit and\nelsewhere to the effect that the placement of an inmate in a special housing unit constituted a \"substantial\n1041 deprivation\" or \"grievous loss.\" Some *1041 of those cases are listed in the margin.[20] For example, in United\nStates ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 338 F.Supp. 311 (W.D. N.Y.1971),aff'd,467 F.2d 51 (2d Cir.1972), Judge Curtin\nfound that confinement in a special housing unit apart from an institution's general population was a \"punishment\nsufficiently severe\" to require minimum procedural safeguards. 338 F.Supp. at 314. By affirming, the Second\n[21]\nCircuit impliedly adopted this conclusion. 467 F.2d at 53-54. The fact that the Adjustment Committee\nProceedings afforded the process required by Sostre during this period is some evidence that the seriousness of\nthe extension of an inmate's confinement in SHU was recognized by correctional officials. Consequently, it could\nbe argued that when the Wolff decision was issued, prison officials should have been aware that the Sostre\nprocedures would no longer be sufficient, particularly given the Wolff Court's implicit rejection of the adequacy of\nthe procedural requirements suggested by Sostre for cases involving serious deprivations. See418 U.S. at 572\n[22]\nn. 20, 94 S.Ct. at 2982 n. 20.\n1042 *1042 The court recognizes that the Wolff Court's distinction between the substantial deprivations at issue in that\ncase and \"lesser penalties\" was somewhat ambiguous and may have caused some confusion. If there was any\ndoubt when the Wolff decision was rendered, however, that doubt should have evaporated after a series of cases\nfrom courts in the Second Circuit within a year of Wolff established that the Wolff procedures (rather than those\nsuggested in Sostre) were to be used when a substantial liberty deprivation was threatened. In United States ex\nrel. Larkins v. Oswald, 510 F.2d 583 (2d Cir.1975), the court stated in dicta that if Wolff were to be applied\nretroactively, it would govern the procedural safeguards that must be provided before an inmate can be removed\nfrom a prison's general population and placed in a special housing unit. Id. at 586-87. Larkins was decided on\nJanuary 24, 1975. On April 23 of that same year, Judge Stewart reached the same conclusion in Powell I.392\nF.Supp. at 630. Judge Stewart, in turn, relied in part on a decision in a similar case by Judge Brieant of the\nSouthern District of New York issued several months before. Crooks v. Warne, 74 Civ. 2351 (S.D.N.Y.1974),aff'd\nin part and vacated in part,516 F.2d 837 (2d Cir.1975). The Crooks decision was vacated by the Second Circuit\non May 22, 1975 because the court felt that the relief prescribed by Judge Stewart in Powell I should be adhered\nto in the interest of uniformity. The Second Circuit implicitly recognized in that case, however, that hearings at\nwhich \"special custodial confinement\" might be imposed must be conducted in accordance with Wolff.516 F.2d at\n839.\nPinpointing the exact date when defendants reasonably should have known that the principle explicitly\nenunciated in McCann became \"clearly established\" is difficult. The court believes that by the time the Supreme\nCourt's opinion in Wolff was supplemented by Judge Brieant's decision in Crooks and the Second Circuit's\ndecision in Larkins, Clinton officials reasonably should have known that confinement in SHU was a deprivation of\nsuch magnitude that the procedural minima mandated by Wolff must be met. This would make January 24, 1975\nthe date upon which defendants could no longer rely on good faith immunity.\nThis conclusion is not undermined by the fact that the Adjustment Committees only extended an inmate's period\nof confinement in SHU because of rule infractions committed while the inmate was held in SHU, and thus did not \nchange an inmate's living situation. It is true that most of the cases cited above involved questions concerning the\nprocess that was due when an inmate was to be removed from the general population and placed in a special\nhousing unit or segregation for disciplinary reasons. However, the court finds no rational distinction, at least\ninsofar as the requirements of procedural due process are concerned, between an extension of special housing\nbeyond the period originally specified at a Superintendent's Proceeding and an inmate's initial placement in\nspecial housing. The liberty interest at stake remains the same: the inmate's interest in being housed in the less\n\naustere environs of the prison's general population. Indeed, Crooks involved a challenge to procedures utilized in\ncontinuing an inmate's confinement in a special housing unit. 516 F.2d at 839.\nThe result reached in this case is not changed by the fact that prison officials did not intend to impose significant\npunitive sanctions through Adjustment Committee Proceedings. \"The test cannot be based upon the motives of\nprison officials, but must rely upon the effect of the more restrictive confinement on the inmate.\" Diamond v.\nThompson, 364 F.Supp. 659, 664 (M.D.Ala.1973). The fact that an inmate would have his time in special housing\nextended by only one week at a time does not support an argument that Adjustment Committees only imposed\n\"lesser sanctions,\" since the Adjustment Committees had unlimited power to extend such confinement in\n1043 successive seven-day terms. Indeed, plaintiffs themselves were retained *1043 in SHU for several months\nthrough successive extensions by Clinton's Adjustment Committees. The disciplinary history of plaintiffs belie any\ngood faith contention on the part of defendants that the short duration of any single sanction took Adjustment\nCommittee Proceedings outside the scope of the Wolff decision.\nThere are cases from the mid- to late-1970s in which Adjustment Committee procedures were upheld in the face\nof procedural due process attacks. In 1977, the New York Court of Appeals found that \"[s]ince no sanction more\nsevere than the loss of minor privileges can result from adjustment committee action, strict full due process\nstandards need not be met in these informal proceedings.\" Amato v. Ward, 41 N.Y.2d 469, 472-73, 393 N.Y.S.2d\n[23]\n934, 937, 362 N.E.2d 566, 569 (1977); see also Flaherty v. Fogg, 72 A.D.2d 861, 421 N.Y. S.2d 736 (3d\nDept.1979),appeal denied, 48 N.Y.2d 612, 425 N.Y.S.2d. 1028, 402 N.E.2d 144 (1980). In Frazier v. Ward, Judge\nFoley found that the procedures afforded in disciplinary hearings within New York prisons did not offend due\nprocess. 426 F.Supp. at 1369-70. A close reading of these cases reveals that these courts were assessing the\nconstitutionality of prison disciplinary proceedings as they should have been conducted after amendments made\nto the regulations governing New York's correctional facilities became effective on May 19, 1975. In Amato, the\nCourt of Appeals summarized these regulations (as amended) and concluded that inmates in New York prisons\n\"received, with regard to all discrete charges of misconduct, procedural protections in excess of those mandated\nby the Wolff doctrine.\" 41 N.Y.2d at 473, 393 N.Y.S.2d at 937, 362 N.E.2d at 570. In Frazier, Judge Foley similarly\ndetermined that the relevant regulations, as amended May 19, 1975, comported with the requirements of Wolff.\n426 F.Supp. at 1370. The proof in the present case clearly indicates that the regulatory framework discussed in \nAmato and Frazier was not followed at Clinton in the period of time relevant to plaintiffs' claims. Consequently,\nthese cases do not alter the court's conclusion that correctional officials in New York should have known by the\nWinter of 1975 that the imposition of keeplock confinement by Clinton's Adjustment Committees offended due\n[24]\nprocess.\nIn sum, the court finds that defendants are not entitled to good faith immunity after January 24, 1975. Plaintiffs\nMorgan and Born-Allah were confined in Unit 14 after that date as a result of Adjustment Committee Proceedings\nconducted in violation of the Constitution's due process clause. Plaintiff Goggins, on the other hand, left Unit 14\nin August 1984 (shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in Wolff), and with respect to his procedural due\nprocess claim defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from liability.\n3. Relief\nSection 1983 codifies \"`a species of tort liability' in favor of persons who are deprived of `rights, privileges, or\nimmunities secured' to them by the Constitution,\" Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 253, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1047, 55\nL.Ed.2d 252 (1978) (quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 417, 96 S.Ct. 984, 988, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976)),\nand consequently the level of damages awarded for the violation of constitutional rights under ยง 1983 is\ndetermined, for the most part, by reference to principles gleaned from the common law of torts. Memphis\nCommunity School District v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 2542, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986). To obtain an\n1044 *1044 award of compensatory damages under ยง 1983, a plaintiff must show that he has suffered an actual injury\nand that there is a causal connection between that injury and the deprivation of a federal right caused by the\ndefendant. Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 262-64, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1051-53, 55 L.Ed.2d 252; see also Stachura,\n106 S.Ct. at 2542-45; McCann, 698 F.2d at 126. In this case, the injury suffered by plaintiffs Morgan and Born-\nAllah was their continued confinement in SHU. The procedures afforded plaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah in the\nAdjustment Committee Proceedings were constitutionally defective in three particulars: plaintiffs were not given\n\nwritten advance notice of the charges against them, were not informed of their qualified right to call witnesses,\nand were not provided a written statement from the Committees explaining the actions taken and disclosing the\nevidence relied upon in deciding to take that action. Determining whether there is a causal relationship between\nthese deficiencies and plaintiffs' injuries is not an easy matter in this case, particularly in view of the long period of\ntime that has elapsed since the occurrence of the events germane to this lawsuit. The court will examine the\ncircumstances surrounding the punishment of Morgan and Born-Allah in turn.\nMorgan's disciplinary record reveals that between January 24, 1975 and his transfer from Unit 14 in September\n1975, he refused to leave his cell to attend Adjustment Committee Proceedings. Morgan testified that he felt that\nthe Adjustment Committee was a \"kangaroo court\" that perfunctorily credited false or trivial charges made by\nClinton's correctional officers. There is no evidence that this opinion had a basis in fact. Although the Adjustment\nCommittee Proceedings failed to satisfy the Wolff requirements, they hardly constituted a mockery of justice.\nIndeed, the procedural safeguards provided satisfied Sostre, a well-considered opinion by Judge Kaufman\nspeaking for a majority of the Second Circuit sitting en banc. See442 F.2d at 194-99. Moreover, the court rejects\n[25]\nMorgan's contention that the disciplinary charges made against him were either false or trivial.  Consequently,\nMorgan's voluntary decision to refuse to meet with the Adjustment Committee was unjustified. Without deciding\nwhether there may be circumstances under which the exhaustion of the disciplinary procedures available to an\ninmate would not be required before he would be allowed to challenge disciplinary charges in a judicial forum, the\ncourt finds that under the circumstances of the present case Morgan's failure to contest the charges made\nagainst him through the Adjustment Committee Proceedings provided precludes him from challenging in federal\ncourt the factual basis those charges. To allow Morgan to challenge the charges after he unjustifiably refused to\ncomply with established administrative procedures would undermine respect for all of the administrative\nmechanisms established by the State of New York for resolving disputes within its penal institutions. The court\nwill not go down this road, and will assume that the charges made against Morgan are supported in fact. Cf. \nHasan Jamal Abdul Majid v. Henderson, 533 F.Supp. 1257, 1273 (N.D. N.Y.) (failure of inmate to request that\nwitnesses be called to testify at disciplinary hearing prevented inmate from challenging failure of Adjustment\nCommittee to call witnesses under due process clause), aff'd mem.,714 F.2d 115 (2d Cir.1982); see also Wolfe\n1045 v. Carlson, 583 F.Supp. 977, 983 *1045 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (\"Plaintiff cannot turn his own lack of diligence into a\nconstitutional deprivation\").\nDeeming the charges made by correctional officers during the period following January 24, 1975 to be true, the\ncourt concludes that the punishment dispensed 00 continued confinement in SHU 00 was fair and appropriate.\n97 97\nTherefore, Morgan suffered no actual injury as a result of the deficiencies in the Adjustment Committee\nProceedings, and is not entitled to compensatory damages. Morgan is entitled to nominal damages and an award\nof attorney fees for the deprivation of his \"absolute\" right to procedural due process. See Carey v. Piphus, 435\nU.S. at 266, 98 S.Ct. at 1053 (citing cases).\nPlaintiff Born-Allah was confined in SHU from January 24, 1975 until the end of March of that same year without\nthe benefit of a hearing that met the procedural requisites of Wolff. In that period, there were eight occasions in\nwhich keeplock confinement was imposed after Born-Allah appeared before Clinton's Adjustment Committees.\nThe record indicates that at only one of those appearances did plaintiff admit to the charges made against him.\n[26]\n Because of the procedural shortcomings attending the hearings plaintiff was provided on the seven\nremaining occasions that he appeared before the Adjustment Committees, the court cannot assume that Born-\nAllah committed the rule violations with which he was charged but to which he had not confessed between\nJanuary 21, 1975 (the date of the last Adjustment Committee Proceeding conducted by prison officials in\nobjective good faith) and March 25, 1975. Largely because of the substantial amount of time that has elapsed\nsince these disciplinary reports were made, the testimony at trial did not adequately establish that plaintiff\ncommitted these violations. It is unlikely that providing plaintiff a new hearing conforming with the requirements of\nWolff at this time would effectively resolve whether the violations were fairly attributable to Born-Allah or whether\nthe punishment meted out for those violations, if they occurred, was appropriate. In light of this, the court\nconcludes that plaintiff Born-Allah suffered actual injury that resulted from the denial of his procedural due\nprocess rights, and is entitled to $750 in compensatory damages. Compare Larkins, 510 F.2d at 589 (jury award\nof $1,000 was \"not `so grossly excessive as to shock the judicial conscience'\" in a case where an inmate was\nheld in segregation for twelve days in violation of Sostre).\n\nPlaintiffs have sought punitive damages. In Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983),\nthe Supreme Court held that punitive damages are available in ยง 1983 actions when one party has maliciously or\nwantonly deprived another of a federal right. Id.461 U.S. at 51, 103 S.Ct. at 1637. Plaintiffs allege that Clinton's\nguards maliciously made false or frivolous disciplinary charges against them which could not be effectively\ndisputed at the Adjustment Committee hearings that were provided. The court rejects plaintiffs' contention that\nClinton's correctional officers purposefully made unwarranted disciplinary charges against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\nconceded that they had committed many of the rule infractions with which they were charged in their testimony at\n[27]\ntrial.  The court accepts the testimony of Clinton's correctional officers regarding other rule violations\n1046 committed by plaintiffs.[28]*1046 Further, although the procedures utilized in Clinton's Adjustment Committee\nProceedings were inadequate, the court finds no evidence that these deficiencies resulted from an intention on\nthe part of correctional officials to deny inmates housed in SHU their due process rights, nor were they designed\n[29]\nas a pretext for unfairly punishing unpopular inmates. Therefore, punitive damages will not be awarded.\nPlaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah have \"succeed[ed] on [a] significant issue\" in this ยง 1983 action by \"achiev[ing]\nsome of the benefit [they] sought in bringing suit,\" and thus are \"prevailing parties\" within the meaning of 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1988. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). When a\nplaintiff is a prevailing party within the meaning of ยง 1988, he is entitled to an award attorney fees absent\n\"`special circumstances which would render such an award unjust.'\" Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d 1265, 1272\n(2d Cir.1986) (quoting Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d\n1263 (1968) (per curiam)), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 918, 107 S.Ct. 1373, 94 L.Ed.2d 689 (1987). No such special\ncircumstances exist here, and thus the court will entertain an application from plaintiffs' attorney for work\nreasonably expended on plaintiffs' procedural due process claims.\nFinally, although the issue is largely academic given the State of New York's policy of indemnifying its public\nservants for torts committed while in the course of their public employment, see N.Y. Pub.Off.Law ยงยง 17 and 18\n(McKinney 1988), the court must determine which of the defendants is liable for the damages sustained by\nplaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah. A defendant cannot be held liable for damages under ยง 1983 unless he was\npersonally involved in the deprivation of the plaintiff's rights under federal law. Gill v. Mooney, 824 F.2d 192, 196\n(2d Cir. 1987); McKinnon v. Patterson, 568 F.2d at 934. Initially, the court has rejected the contention that\nplaintiffs were the victims of a conspiracy among Clinton's correctional officers to file false or frivolous disciplinary\nreports against them, and thus there was no personal involvement on the part of the individual correctional\nofficers in the deprivation of plaintiffs' due process rights. The requisite personal involvement on the part of\ndefendant Ronald Fuller, in 1974 and 1975 Clinton's Safety and Security Lieutenant in charge of the conduct of\nClinton's disciplinary hearings, does exist and thus he is liable under ยง 1983. Defendants Benjamin Ward, New\n[30]\nYork's Commissioner of Correctional Services in 1975,  and J. Edwin LaVallee, Clinton's Superintendent, are\nalso liable. A supervisory official may be liable under ยง 1983 when he \"created a policy or custom under which\nunconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed such a policy or custom to continue,\" or when he learned of a\nconstitutional violation through a report or an appeal and failed to remedy the violation. Williams v. Smith, 781\nF.2d 319, 323 (2d Cir.1986). Both Ward and LaVallee can fairly be charged with constructive notice of the\nAdjustment Committee procedures that were employed at Clinton. See McCann, 698 F.2d at 125.\nD. Use of Force\nEach of the plaintiffs allege that they were subjected to the use of excessive force by Clinton's correctional\nofficers on separate occasions. Plaintiff Morgan testified that he was attacked without provocation by at least six\ncorrectional officers as he was returning to his cell after showering on August 15, 1974. Plaintiff Goggins claims\n1047 that three days later, he was beaten *1047 by eight correctional officers as he was leaving the showers. Plaintiff\nBorn-Allah testified that on November 9, 1974 he was struck in the head with an ax handle by Correctional Officer\nClifford Martin and beaten by other correctional officers while a search of his cell was being conducted.\nDefendants admit that force was applied by correctional officers in each of these incidents (though they maintain\nthat the force used was not as great as plaintiffs claim), but contend that the force used in each case was a\nreasonable and justifiable response to violent attacks initiated by plaintiffs.\n\nThe assessment of an inmate's allegation of the excessive use of force by correctional personnel is controlled by\nJudge Friendly's definitive analysis in Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,414 U.S. 1033, 94\nS.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1973). There, Judge Friendly posited that the Supreme Court's decision in Rochin v.\nCalifornia, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952), stood for the principle \"that, quite apart from any\n`specific' of the Bill of Rights, application of undue force by law enforcement officers deprives a suspect of liberty\nwithout due process of law,\" 481 F.2d at 1032, and that this same principle extended \"to acts of brutality by\n[31]\ncorrectional officers.\" Id. at 1033.  Judge Friendly noted that the violent realities of this nation's correctional\nfacilities must be taken into account in formulating a standard by which to determine whether correctional officers\nat these facilities have engaged in \"conduct that shocks the conscience\" or \"offend[s] even hardened\nsensibilities,\" see Rochin, 342 U.S. at 172, 72 S.Ct. at 209, and, conscious of these realities, he set out a\nnonexhaustive list of factors to be considered in assessing excessive force claims:\nIn determining whether the constitutional line has been crossed, a court must look to such factors\nas the need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force\nthat was used, the extent of injury inflicted, and whether force was applied in a good faith effort to\nmaintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\n481 F.2d at 1033; see also Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 320-21, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1085, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986)\n; Corselli v. Coughlin, 842 F.2d 23 (2d Cir.1988). With this guideline in mind, the court will examine the\ncircumstances surrounding each of the incidents at issue in this case, taking them in chronological order.\n1. The August 15, 1974 Incident Involving Plaintiff Morgan\nPlaintiff Morgan testified that on August 15, 1974, he was the victim of an unprovoked attack by some of Clinton's\ncorrectional officers while returning to his cell in SHU after showering. He stated that Correctional Officer Patrick\n[32]\nConley struck him in the head with an ax handle.  This testimony was contradicted by Correctional Officers\nConley and Bryan Huckeba, who attested that Morgan attacked Conley, and that they along with two other\ncorrectional officers used only that force necessary to subdue Morgan and return him to his cell. Conley denied\nthat he was carrying an ax handle on that day. Subsequently, plaintiff Morgan pleaded guilty to a reduced charge\nof attempted assault that arose out of the August 15 incident.\nMorgan is collaterally estopped from denying that he instigated the clash with correctional officers that day.\n1048 Because *1048 the government is held to a higher burden of proof in criminal cases, a criminal defendant can be\nestopped from relitigating any issue decided against him in a criminal proceeding in a subsequent civil action,\neven when the government ostensibly is not a party in the latter action. Gelb v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., 798 F.2d\n38, 43 (2d Cir.1986),cert. denied,480 U.S. 948, 107 S.Ct. 1608, 94 L.Ed.2d 794 (1987); United States v. Podell,\n572 F.2d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 1978). A conviction of attempted assault precludes a finding that Morgan struck the\ncorrectional officers in self-defense that day, and mandates a conclusion that Morgan instigated the violent\nconfrontation. See N.Y.Penal Law ยง 35.15(1) (McKinney 1987) (use of physical force in defense of self or third\nperson is a defense to criminal charge of assault); see also People v. Goetz, 68 N.Y.2d 96, 105-06, 506 N.Y.S.2d\n18, 24, 497 N.E.2d 41, 46-47 (1986). In any event, the court disbelieves Morgan's testimony concerning the\nAugust 15 incident, and finds credible the testimony of Conley and Huckeba to the effect that Morgan initiated the\nincident.\nA finding that an inmate initially attacked a prison guard, of course, does not preclude the possibility that the\nresponse to this attack by prison personnel was excessive and unreasonable. In the case at bar, the court fully\ncredits the testimony of Conley and Huckeba and finds that the force used to subdue Morgan was not greater\nthan necessary under the circumstances. The credible evidence indicates that as Officers Conley, Huckeba and\nBrooks were escorting Morgan back to his cell after showering, Morgan turned and struck Conley with his fist.\nThe three officers present, quickly joined by Correctional Officer Miles Martin, tackled Morgan. Morgan resisted,\nthrashing about violently, until the officers were able to subdue him and carry him to his cell. During the course of\nthis skirmish, Conley suffered a broken hand and Huckeba sustained a knee injury that disabled him for six\n\nmonths. Morgan, in contrast, suffered comparatively minor injuries to the eye and shoulder that did not require\nmedical attention.\nIn sum, the court concludes that Morgan's unprovoked attack necessitated the application of force, that the force\nused was commensurate with the measure of force required by the circumstances, and that force was used in a\ngood faith effort to restore order. Therefore, Morgan's excessive force claim is meritless.\n2. The August 18, 1974 Incident Involving Plaintiff Goggins\n[33]\nIn his deposition testimony,  plaintiff Goggins stated that Correctional Officer Clarence Martin was harassing\nhim as he was being taken to the showers on August 18, 1974, stepping on his heels and jabbing him in the back\n1049 with an ax handle. Goggins attests that he turned *1049 around, and Martin tackled him to the ground. Martin\nbegan punching Goggins, and other officers began hitting his legs and ankles with ax handles. Goggins claims\n[34]\nthat Sergeant Sherry Dobbs approached the area in which this scuffle was occurring and sprayed tear gas\ninto Goggins' face.\nThis recount of the events surrounding the use of force incident involving Goggins is at odds with the testimony of\ndefendants Dobbs and Clarence Martin. According to Martin, he and another correctional officer, Frank\nWoodward, were escorting Goggins to the showers when Goggins turned and grabbed Woodward. Woodward\npushed Goggins to the ground and went down on top of the inmate. Goggins was then allowed back on his feet,\n[35]\nand he ran back into his cell.  As the officers approached Goggins to close the hinged steel door of the\ninmate's cell, Goggins threw a blanket between the door and the door casing, preventing the door from being\nclosed and secured. Defendant Dobbs testified that Goggins was ordered repeatedly to move to the front of the\ncell so that the guards could safely approach and remove the blanket. Goggins refused, and began throwing\nbooks and other objects against the cell wall. Dobbs then applied one short burst of tear gas to Goggins' face,\ncausing Goggins to move away from the doorway and allowing the officers to remove the blanket and close the\ncell door.\nDetermining which of the contradictory versions of the August 18, 1974 incident to believe is complicated by the\nfact that the court was unable to observe Goggins' demeanor while he testified. The court does note, however,\nthat throughout Goggins deposition, he denied responsibility for absolutely every offense 00 whether criminal or\n97\ndisciplinary 00 with which he has ever been charged. He denied committing the offense of which he was originally\n97\nconvicted in 1970; he denied responsibility for a subsequent parole violation that landed him in prison a second\ntime; he attributed the long list of disciplinary charges that he accumulated at Clinton to a conspiracy among\nprison guards and officials. In light of the distorted vision of reality such denials manifest, it is difficult for the court\nto give his version of the August 18 incident credence. Moreover, there was nothing in the demeanor or internal\nconsistency of the testimony of either Martin or Dobbs which would make this court disbelieve them. Although\nsome of the testimony differed in detail from the contemporaneous report that was prepared immediately after the\nincident, see supra note 35, none of the discrepancies fundamentally undermine the testimony given. The court\naccepts the account of the incident given by Martin and Dobbs.\nThe court concludes that the force used to subdue Goggins was neither unreasonable or excessive. Goggins\nattack on Woodward was met with force in kind, and it does not appear that serious physical injury resulted from\nthe initial force applied by Woodward. The use of tear gas, which did cause significant short-term injuries in the\nform of gas burns to Goggins' eye, face, and back, was not excessive under the circumstances, because the\ninmate's failure to obey an order that was issued on several occasions presented a threat of physical harm to\nprison personnel. Therefore, the court concludes that Goggins has failed to establish that he is entitled to recover\non his excessive force claim.\n3. The November 9, 1974 Incident Involving Plaintiff Born-Allah\nOn November 9, 1974 prison officials conducted a search of each of the twelve cells in the gallery in which\n1050 plaintiff Born-Allah was housed, attempting to locate *1050 a law book that had been loaned from the prison\n\nlibrary to an inmate in that gallery. The book had not been found in the borrower's cell, and it was suspected that\nthe book might have been passed from cell to cell within the gallery. Several of the cells in the gallery had been\nsearched without incident when then-Sergeant (now Lieutenant) William Durnin and Correctional Officers Clifford\nMartin, James O'Brian, and Abe Brusso came to the cell occupied by Born-Allah. What transpired next is\ndisputed.\nBorn-Allah testified that his memory of the incident was vague. He remembers that after he had been taken out of\nhis cell, Officer Martin raised an ax handle threateningly and ordered the prisoner to \"assume the position\" so that\nthe officers could conduct a pat-down search. Born-Allah recalls being hit by Martin and held by Durnin, claims he\nfell into unconsciousness, and was thrown back into his cell. As a result of this fracas, the inmate suffered injuries\nto his left elbow, left knee, and ribs, along with various contusions and bruises.\nThe account of the incident given by Officers Martin and Brusso and Lieutenant Durnin diverges with that of Born-\nAllah dramatically. According to the testimony of these correctional officers, Born-Allah was informed that a library\nbook was missing and that a search of all of the cells in the gallery was being conducted. Under the procedures\nutilized at Clinton at that time, see Exh. T, the inmate whose cell was to be searched was required to exit the cell,\nmove at least two doors away from his cell, and face a wall, placing both hands on the wall and spreading his\nlegs. A pat-down search of that inmate was then conducted, followed by a search of the inmate's cell. Born-Allah\nrefused to \"assume the position\" or submit to a pat-down search. As Durnin, Martin, and two other correctional\nofficers approached Born-Allah after the inmate had twice ignored orders to assume the proper position against\nthe wall, the inmate attacked, throwing punches and kicking out at the officers. The officers attempted to deflect\nBorn-Allah's kicks with their batons. The inmate kicked Correctional Officer Martin with such force that Martin\nsustained a large bruise in the chest area and suffered a permanent partial disability to his right thumb. The\nofficers present used their batons to force the inmate back into his cell.\nInitially, the court notes that the search being conducted by prison officials on November 9, 1974 did not violate\nany of Born-Allah's constitutional rights. The search of the cells in the gallery did not implicate any rights\nprotected by the fourth amendment. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)\n. Moreover, the pat-down search was supported by a reasonable suspicion that \"crime was afoot,\" and thus was\nreasonable under all of the circumstances. Compare Commonwealth v. Wallington, 238 Pa.Super. 427, 357 A.2d\n598 (1976) (a more intrusive search of twelve men in a cell upon discovery that $500 had been taken from a\nthirteenth man in the same cell was deemed reasonable).\nWith regard to the details of the November 9 incident, the court accepts the account of that episode offered by\nthe prison guards who testified. On the witness stand, Born-Allah exhibited under effective cross-examination the\ncombativeness and violent temper described in the testimony of Durnin, Martin and Brusso. The inmate revealed\nthe ethical development of a seven-year old, indicating that one's manhood should be measured by his ability to\ndominate others physically and hinting that individual disputes are best settled by martial confrontation. The court\nfinds little comfort in Born-Allah's assurance that he is \"level-headed\" when he is out-numbered and at a\ndisadvantage. Further, the inmate's testimony to the effect that Martin, unprovoked, swung an ax handle \"like a\nbaseball bat\" and struck him in the head with enough force to render him unconscious lacks credibility in light of\nthe fact that he did not suffer severe injuries as a result of the November 9 incident. In short, the court rejects the\ntestimony of Born-Allah concerning this use of force incident and finds that the credible evidence indicates that\n1051 Born-Allah instigated *1051 the confrontation, and that the use of force by Clinton's guards was justified under\nthe circumstances.\nHaving found that the initial search was justified and that Born-Allah initiated the violence on November 9, 1974,\nthe only question remaining is whether the force used to repel the inmate's attack was proportionate to the risk to\nthe safety of the officers involved and the security of the institution. The court finds that it was. The evidence\nindicates that Born-Allah assumed a martial arts stance and began kicking at the officers with considerable\npower. The officers responded forcefully, as would be expected under the circumstances. The injuries actually\nsuffered by the inmate 00 a sore left elbow and knee, sore ribs, and contusions to the head that did not require\n97\nstitches 00 are not of the sort that would evidence that excessive force was used. The officers who testified\n97\nconcerning this incident related that Born-Allah was hit with batons and ax handles until he was driven back into\n\nhis cell and secured. The court accepts this testimony, and finds that this was the degree of force necessary to\nrestore order. Consequently, the court finds no merit in Born-Allah's excessive use of force claim.\nE. The Strip Search Policy\nThe most serious challenge to conditions within Unit 14 during the period relevant to this lawsuit involves\nClinton's practice of routinely conducting visual body cavity searches of inmates housed in Unit 14 before and\n[36]\nafter leaving that unit.  For example, such searches would be conducted before and after an inmate engaged\nin contact visits with individuals from outside the prison, or before attending Adjustment Committee Proceedings.\nA policy mandating strip searches of this sort can be attacked as violative of the fourth amendment's prohibition\nof unreasonable searches and seizures, or as a cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the eighth\namendment. The court will address the fourth amendment implications of Clinton's strip search policies in 1974\nand 1975 under this sub-heading. The search policy will be considered along with other conditions of\nconfinement within SHU in assessing plaintiffs' eighth amendment claims in the following section. See text, infra\nat 1055-56.\nThe fourth amendment prohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Its applicability\n\"depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a `justifiable,' a `reasonable' or a `legitimate\nexpectation of privacy' that has been invaded by government action.\" Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740, 99\nS.Ct. 2577, 2591, 61 L.Ed. 2d 220 (1979) (citing cases). The inmates housed in SHU in 1974 and 1975 retained\nan expectation of privacy in their bodies that society \"recognize[s] as `reasonable,'\" Katz v. United States, 389\nU.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 516, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring), and thus any governmental\ninvasion of that privacy interest must also be \"reasonable.\" See, e.g., Hodges v. Stanley, 712 F.2d 34 (2d Cir.\n1983) (inmate held in administrative detention); Hurley v. Ward, 584 F.2d 609 (2d Cir.1978) (Hurley I) (inmates\nheld in punitive segregation unit); cf. Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986) (pre-trial detainees), cert. denied,\n___ U.S. ___, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987). To assess the reasonableness of an invasion of a privacy\ninterest, a court must balance \"the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the\nsearch entails.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court held that routine visual body cavity searches of a pre-trial detainee\nconducted after a contact visit by someone from outside the prison did not violate the detainee's fourth\namendment rights, even in the absence of either probable cause or reasonable suspicion that the detainee\n1052 possessed contraband. 441 U.S. at 558-60, 99 S.Ct. at *1052 1884-85. In reaching this conclusion, the Court\npurported to weigh \"the scope of the particular intrusion [upon the detainee's personal rights], the manner in\nwhich [the search was] conducted, the justification for initiating [the search], and the place in which [the search\nwas] conducted.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The Court emphasized that \"the serious security dangers\"\nassociated with detention facilities and the ever-present threat that contraband could be smuggled into the facility\njustified routine body cavity searches, regardless of \"the degree to which these searches may invade the\npersonal privacy of inmates.\" Id. at 559-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85; cf. id. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 18 (\"[T]he central\nobjective of prison administration [is] safeguarding institutional security.\").\nThe case at bar is distinguishable from Bell v. Wolfish in that the strip searches were conducted both before and\nafter contact visits. Plaintiffs argue that because they were confined in Spartan cells without many of their\npersonal belongings, the danger of smuggling something out of the prison was nonexistent, and thus the policy\nrequiring strip searches before contact visits was unreasonable. This argument is persuasive, and is consistent\nwith precedent within this Circuit preceding the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v. Wolfish. For example, in \nHurley I, 584 F.2d 609, the Second Circuit found that the same sort of visual body cavity search policy at issue in\nthe case at bar 00 subjecting inmates confined in the special housing units at maximum security prisons in the\n97\nState of New York to routine strip searches before and after leaving the special housing unit 00 violated\n97\nconstitutional protections afforded those inmates. Id. at 611 (aff'g on this point Hurley v. Ward, 448 F.Supp. 1227\n[37]\n(S.D.N.Y.1978)). Judge Foley's decision in Frazier v. Ward, 426 F.Supp. at 1362-66, is in accord with Hurley I.\nThe Second Circuit's decision in Hurley I relied in part upon its decision in Wolfish v. Levi, 573 F.2d 118 (2d\nCir.1978), however, and that decision was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court under the caption of Bell\n\nv. Wolfish. Thus, the question is whether Hurley I remains good law in the aftermath of that Supreme Court\ndecision.\nAlthough the question is a close one, this court believes that it does. In Hurley I, the Second Circuit reviewed the\npropriety of a preliminary injunction imposed by the district court, and the matter was remanded to the district\n[38]\ncourt.  After conducting a full-blown trial on the merits, Judge Carter of the Southern District of New York\nconsidered the effect of Bell v. Wolfish on the preliminary determination of the reasonableness of routine body\ncavity searches that had been made. Hurley v. Ward, 549 F.Supp. 174, 186 (S.D.N.Y.1982) (Hurley II). Judge\nCarter concluded that such searches after contact visits were permissible, but that in \"all other circumstances\"\nbody cavity searches absent some level of cause were deemed unreasonable. Id. Consequently, under Judge\nCarter's opinion in Hurley II, a body cavity search could not be conducted absent at least reasonable suspicion\nwhen an inmate left SHU for a contact visit. Accord Frazier v. Ward, 528 F.Supp. 80 (N.D.N.Y.1981) (denying\nmotion for reconsideration); Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 888-91 (1st Cir.) (Maletz, J., dissenting), cert. denied,\n464 U.S. 999, 104 S.Ct. 502, 78 L.Ed.2d 693 (1983); see also Hodges v. Stanley, 712 F.2d 34, 36 (2d Cir.1983)\n(A second body cavity search of inmate conducted shortly after the first, even though he had been under\ncontinual escort between searches, may be unconstitutional); Bono v. Saxbe, 620 F.2d 609, 617 (7th Cir.1980) (\nBell did not approve of strip searches after supervised non-contact visits absent some showing of particularized\nsuspicion).\n1053 *1053 Although the court finds that Hurley I is still good law, the court recognizes that there is strong authority to\nthe contrary. For example, the majority opinion in Arruda v. Fair provides strong support for defendants'\ncontention that the body cavity searches at issue in the present case did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\n710 F.2d at 886-88. That case, like the case at bar, was instituted by an inmate of a maximum security prison\nhoused in a special housing unit for disciplinary reasons. The majority indicated that there was even stronger\njustification for routine body cavity searches 00 even when inmates were leaving special housing and before any\n97\ncontact with the outside world 00 in cases involving the dangerous and troublesome prisoners confined in such\n97\nunits than was present in cases involving pre-trial detainees. Id. at 887. The First Circuit noted the problems\nassociated with prison guards and other employees introducing contraband into a segregated unit, and\nconcluded that \"[d]espite the prisoner's relative isolation, someone, such as an untrustworthy prison employee,\nmight place contraband in a cell at night for the prisoner to pass to others....\" Id. at 888. Body cavity search\npolicies similar to that at issue in Arruda v. Fair and the present case were condoned in Goff v. Nix, 803 F.2d 358,\n370-71 (8th Cir.1986),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 108 S.Ct. 115, 98 L.Ed.2d 73 (1987), and Campbell v. Miller,\n[39]\n787 F.2d 217, 228 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,479 U.S. 1019, 107 S.Ct. 673, 93 L.Ed.2d 724 (1986).  Given the\nextreme deference to those who administer penal institutions in combatting imagined security threats exhibited by\n[40]\nthe Bell v. Wolfish majority,  it is possible that these latter cases are more consistent with the Supreme Court's\napproach to the problems presented by Clinton's search policy of 1974 and 1975, and under those cases\nClinton's policy would survive scrutiny. Nonetheless, Judge Carter's decision in Hurley II demonstrates that \nHurley I can be reconciled with Bell v. Wolfish, and absent repudiation of this precedent by the Second Circuit,\nthis court will follow it.\nA determination that Clinton's search policy violated the fourth amendment, however, does not end the court's\ninquiry. Even if the strip search policy employed in 1974 and 1975 violated the fourth amendment, defendants are\nentitled to good faith immunity. In the period when Clinton's strip search policy was in force and thereafter, similar\npolicies were withstanding scrutiny under the fourth amendment elsewhere. Those cases are listed in the margin.\n1054 [41] In light of this *1054 substantial body of authority, the court finds that defendants are immune from liability so\nfar as plaintiffs can argue that the searches conducted violated the fourth amendment. Compare Security and\nLaw Enforcement Employees v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 210-11 (2d Cir.1984) (high correctional officials entitled to\nqualified immunity from liability for damages sustained as result of unconstitutional policy of conducting random\nbody cavity searches of prison guards).\n\nF. Conditions of Confinement\nPlaintiffs also claim that other conditions within Unit 14 during the time relevant to this lawsuit were so poor that\nthe eighth amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was violated. The eighth amendment\nmandates that prison conditions \"must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain, nor may they be\ngrossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting punishment.\" Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337,\n347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 69 L.Ed. 2d 59 (1981). The inquiry to be made is whether prison conditions are such\nthat they \"deprive inmates of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\" Id. Not all deprivations,\ntherefore, give rise to eighth amendment concerns; \"instead, the deprivations that trigger [e]ighth [a]mendment\nscrutiny are deprivations of essential human needs.\" Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F.2d 828, 836\n(D.C.Cir.1988) (emphasis omitted). The eighth amendment is implicated, for example, when inmates are denied\n\"essential food, medical care, or sanitation,\" or when conditions are such that the threat of violence among\ninmates is increased. Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 348, 101 S.Ct. at 2400. The eighth amendment is not violated merely\nbecause conditions are austere or desolate; \"[t]o the extent that such conditions are restrictive and even harsh,\nthey are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\" Id. at 347, 101 S.Ct. at\n2399.\nPlaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that conditions within SHU elicit the degree of outrage contemplated by the\neighth amendment. The complaint's allegation that the inmates in SHU were denied needed medical care is\nunsupported by the evidence introduced at trial. None of the plaintiffs were denied medical attention unless they\nrefused it; there is no evidence that Clinton's officials were deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of the\ninmates housed in Unit 14, nor that plaintiffs suffered either short-term or long-term injuries attributable to\ninadequate medical care. The related allegation that prison officials drugged the food of the inmates housed in\n[42]\nUnit 14 lacks credibility.  No plausible foundation for plaintiffs' suspicion that they were being drugged by\nprison officials against their will was established.\nAlthough plaintiffs complain of the use of noxious gases such as tear gas by authorized correctional personnel, in\n1055 each of the incidents described at trial in which tear gas was used, such use was *1055 justified under the\ncircumstances. The moderated use of chemical agents such as tear gas or mace is permissible if necessary to\ncontrol an inmate who threatens the safety of the guards or other prisoners or endangers the general security of\nthe prison, and tear gas may be used in situations where there is a need to move a rebellious inmate. See, e.g., \nSpain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189 (9th Cir.1979); Landman v. Peyton, 370 F.2d 135 (4th Cir.1966),cert. denied,\n385 U.S. 881, 87 S.Ct. 168, 17 L.Ed.2d 108 (1968); Collins v. Ward, 652 F.Supp. 500 (S.D.N.Y.1987). The\ncredible evidence introduced at trial indicates that tear gas was used only when an inmate attacked a guard or\nwhen a recalcitrant inmate refused to move under circumstances where that refusal posed the threat of a\nphysical confrontation.\nPlaintiffs testified that they were subjected to various forms of mental abuse by prison guards in a deliberate\nattempt to humiliate and degrade them. For example, plaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah both testified that Clinton's\ncorrectional officers would place cardboard nametags over their cells which contained such insulting phrases as\n\"Monkey\" and \"Don't Feed the Animals.\" Morgan asserted that the guards in SHU required inmates in Unit 14 to\n\"bark like dogs\" before allowing them to shower. The testimony of plaintiffs with regard to the derisive nametags\nand the \"barking\" episodes lacks credibility. The placing of nametags over the cells (\"cages\") of the inmates in\nUnit 14 may have made those inmates feel as if they were being treated like \"animals in a zoo,\" as one prisoner\ntestified, but the court does not credit the testimony of Born-Allah and Morgan to the effect that prison personnel\naffirmatively drew attention to the parallel by writing the names of animals on nametags and placing those tags\nover the inmates' cells. Further, no reference to incidents where prison guards required inmates housed in SHU\nto \"bark like dogs\" was made in the deposition taken from Morgan prior to trial. These supposed incidents were\ncentral to his testimony concerning the allegedly dehumanizing conditions in Unit 14, and it seems unlikely that\nthey would be ignored when depositions were taken.\n[43]\nMorgan and Born-Allah also testified that the guards hurled racial epithets  at them. The court does not for a\nmoment doubt that Clinton's guards used abusive language, including racial slurs, in addressing the institution's\n\ninmates in 1974 and 1975. But this alone does not support a viable eighth amendment claim. The realities of a\nmaximum facility correctional institution are far removed from \"the peace of a judge's chambers,\" Johnson v.\nGlick, 481 F.2d at 1033, and the court is fully aware that the exchange of verbal insults between inmates and\nguards is a constant, daily ritual observed in this nation's prisons. The court does not condone this; it merely\nrecognizes that racial insults do not deprive prisoners of the \"minimal civilized measure of life's necessities,\" and\nthus do not constitute an eighth amendment violation. Williams v. Pecchio, 543 F.Supp. 878, 879-80\n(W.D.N.Y.1982); cf. McFadden v. Lucas, 713 F.2d 143, 147 (5th Cir.1983) (eighth amendment claim of excessive\nforce cannot be maintained absent allegation of \"physical abuse\"), cert. denied,464 U.S. 998, 104 S.Ct. 499, 78\nL.Ed.2d 691 (1983); Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d at 1033 & n. 7 (constitutional protection of prisoners not so\nextensive as common law tort of assault, and \"[e]ven at common law `mere words, however violent, are held not\nto amount to an assault.'\").\nFinally, the court does not find that Clinton's body cavity search policy violated the eighth amendment. The record\ndoes not support a conclusion that this policy was instituted with the intention of punishing inmates housed in Unit\n14. \"[T]he determination whether [certain] restrictions and practices constitute punishment in the constitutional\nsense depends on whether they are rationally related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose and\n1056 whether they appear excessive in relation to that purpose.\" Bell v. Wolfish,*1056 441 U.S. at 561, 99 S.Ct. at\n1886. In the present case, the State's interest in ensuring institutional security was a legitimate nonpunitive\nobjective, and the policy at issue was rationally related to that purpose, even if it was offensive to the fourth\namendment rights of the prisoners affected by the body cavity search policy. See id. Conduct not properly\ndeemed punishment does not violate the eighth amendment absent \"obduracy and wantonness.\" Whitley, 475\nU.S. at 319, 106 S.Ct. at 1084. There is no credible evidence of such wantonness here. In this respect, the case\nat bar is distinguishable from Frazier, in which Judge Foley concluded that a body cavity search that was\n\"conducted in a debasing manner and not for any genuine security purposes\" constituted a cruel and unusual\npunishment violative of the eighth amendment. 426 F.Supp. at 1366.\nPlaintiffs failed to present credible evidence of other conditions within SHU that either singly or in combination\n[44]\noffended the eighth amendment.  Prisons quarter those members of society who have \"demonstrated their\ninability to control and conform their behavior to the legitimate standards of society.\" Soto v. Dickey, 744 F.2d\n1260, 1267 (7th Cir.1984),cert. denied,470 U.S. 1085, 105 S.Ct. 1846, 85 L.Ed.2d 144 (1985). Those who bear\nthe responsibility for administering our prisons must control those who cannot control themselves, \"`at best an\nextraordinarily difficult undertaking.'\" Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. at 527, 104 S.Ct. at 3200 (quoting Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. at 566, 94 S.Ct. at 2979). Consequently, a highly regimented environment exists within\nmaximum security facilities like Clinton. Regimentation by its nature discourages individual expression and\ndiminishes an individual's sense of dignity. These are unfortunate but unavoidable consequences of \"the interest\nof society in the security of its penal institutions.\" Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. at 527, 104 S.Ct. at 3201.\nImprisonment entails a significant loss of rights. Id. at 524, 104 S.Ct. at 3199. The evidence presented at trial did\nnot establish that the rights plaintiffs retained were violated by the conditions of confinement in Unit 14 in 1974\nand 1975.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nJudgment is granted in favor of plaintiff Morgan on his procedural due process claim against defendants Ward,\nLaVallee, and Fuller, and Morgan is awarded $1 in nominal damages and attorney fees. Judgment is granted in\nfavor of plaintiff Born-Allah on his procedural due process claim against defendants Ward, LaVallee, and Fuller,\nand Born-Allah is awarded $750 in compensatory damages and attorney fees. Plaintiffs Morgan and Born-Allah\nare directed to file and serve their fee application on or before November 23, 1988. Objections, if any, should be\nfiled and served on or before December 2, 1988. Oral argument on the fee application will be made at the\nDecember 16, 1988 motion term in Syracuse, New York. Judgment is granted in favor of defendants on all\nremaining claims made in this lawsuit. The Clerk of the Court is directed to enter judgment accordingly.\nIt is So Ordered.\n\n[1] A Special Housing Unit is defined by the regulations promulgated by New York's Department of Correctional\nServices as \"[a] cell or a group of cells within a facility, maintained separate and apart from cells used by inmates\nin the general population, for confinement of inmates who are not in a program that permits them to commingle\nwith the general inmate population.\" 7 N.Y.C.R.R. ยง 300.2(b). Special housing units are used for protective\ndetention, administrative detention, and disciplinary detention. Id. ยง 300.3. A correctional facility in New York\ncommonly has a number of special housing units; for purposes of this lawsuit, \"SHU\" will refer to Clinton's Unit\n14. An inmate housed in SHU in 1974 and 1975 was for the most part isolated from his fellow inmates, prohibited\nfrom using the correctional institution's recreational facilities or participating in work and educational programs,\nand afforded only limited exercise and shower privileges. See id. ยง 302.3. Inmates housed in Unit 14 at Clinton\nwere not in \"solitary confinement,\" as that term is ordinarily used, since the cells in SHU faced an open gallery,\nallowing the inmates confined there to communicate to one another. See id. ยง 330.2(b) & (c).\n[2] It appears that the term \"keeplock\" is ordinarily used to refer to the practice of restricting an inmate to his own\nroom or cell in general population. See McCann v. Coughlin, 698 F.2d 112, 121 (2d Cir.1983). The parties have\nused that term in this case to refer to the continuation of an inmate's detention in Unit 14, and the court will also\nuse the term \"keeplock\" in reference to this latter practice.\n[3] Congress did not abrogate the states' eleventh amendment immunity in enacting 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Quern v.\nJordan, 440 U.S. 332, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979).\n[4] The exception to the general rule for federal constitutional challenges of state statutes and regulations, see Ex\nparte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), does not apply in the case at bar because\nplaintiffs' claims for prospective equitable relief have been mooted by subsequent changes in the regulations and\nprocedures that plaintiffs attack.\n[5] The fact that the State of New York has voluntarily assumed the burden of defending and indemnifying its\nemployees in civil rights suits such as this one \"does not transform a personal-capacity action against a state\nofficial into an official-capacity action against the state.\" Farid v. Smith, 850 F.2d 917, 923 (2d Cir.1988); \nDuckworth v. Franzen, 780 F.2d 645, 650 (7th Cir. 1985),cert. denied,479 U.S. 816, 107 S.Ct. 71, 93 L.Ed.2d 28\n(1986).\n[6] The request for injunctive relief in that case was subsequently withdrawn. See Frazier v. Ward, 426 F.Supp.\n1354, 1356 (N.D.N.Y.1977).\n[7] Defendants also argue that plaintiff Morgan's claim of excessive force is barred by the doctrine of collateral\nestoppel because he was convicted of attempted assault as a result of the incident that gives rise to his\nexcessive force allegations. The preclusive effect that should be given this conviction will be addressed by the\ncourt in its discussion of plaintiffs' excessive force claims. See text, infra at 1047-48.\n[8] Determination of the preclusive effect to be given an earlier federal court judgment in a subsequent action\nbrought in federal court is governed by federal common law. Premier Electrical Construction Co. v. National\nElectrical Contractors Assn., 814 F.2d 358, 363-64 (7th Cir.1987); Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. International Market\nPlace, 773 F.2d 1068, 1069 (9th Cir.1985).\n[9] Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2202, a court rendering a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201 may grant\n\"[f]urther necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree.\" This is a discretionary power,\nand it is not unusual for a district court to decline to entertain individual damage claims that could have the effect\nof rendering a class action for prospective declaratory or injunctive relief unmanageable. See, e.g., Wright v.\nCollins, 766 F.2d 841, 849 (4th Cir.1985); Crowder v. Lash, 687 F.2d 996, 1108-09 (7th Cir.1982).\n[10] Res judicata is an affirmative defense under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c), and consequently the burden is on\ndefendants to demonstrate its applicability to the case at bar.\n[11]Parklane Hosiery discussed the equitable factors a federal court should weigh in determining whether to\nallow the \"offensive\" use of collateral estoppel. Among other things, a court is to determine whether the party\nagainst whom the doctrine is to be used had the incentive to fully and vigorously pursue the earlier action,\n\nwhether the prior judgment relied upon by the party seeking issue preclusion is inconsistent with other previous\njudgments involving the party against whom the doctrine is to be applied, and whether \"procedural opportunities\"\nexist in the action in which preclusion is sought that were not available in the prior action that are \"of a kind that\nmight be likely to cause a different result.\" 439 U.S. at 331-32, 99 S.Ct. at 651.\n[12] Defendants have argued that Judge Foley's disposition of claims implicating the conditions of confinement at\nUnit 14 foreclosed plaintiffs' challenge to such conditions in this action. This contention is predicated on a\nprinciple applicable only in cases in which res judicata applies. See Nevada v. United States, 463 U.S. at 129-30,\n103 S.Ct. at 2917-18. Because the court has determined that res judicata is inapplicable in this case, defendants\ncannot rely on the rule barring plaintiffs from raising claims that could have been raised in the prior action.\n[13] In theory, a segregation unit was distinguishable from a special housing unit by the fact that prisoners held in\nsegregation were not allowed to commingle with one another, while those detained in a special housing unit were\nallowed some contact with other inmates held in the same unit. 7 N.Y.C.R.R. ยง 300.2(b) & (c).\n[14] It is not clear that these changes in the regulations were uniformly followed in New York prisons after their\npromulgation. Plaintiff Morgan was ordered held over in SHU without the benefit of a Superintendent's\nProceeding on several occasions after May 19, 1975. In McCann v. Coughlin, 698 F.2d 112 (2d Cir.1983), the\nSecond Circuit addressed a procedural due process challenge to keeplock in a special housing unit after the\naggrieved inmate had been afforded only a hearing before the Adjustment Committee. That challenge arose out\nof events occurring in 1979.\n[15] In any event, the court agrees that Clinton's body cavity search policy violated plaintiffs' fourth amendment\nrights. See text, infra at 1051-54.\n[16] All allusions to the New York Code of Rules and Regulations in this opinion refer to the regulations in force\nbefore May 19, 1985, unless the text suggests otherwise. The disciplinary system in place in 1974 has been\nreplaced by a three-tier disciplinary system.\n[17]But see Powell v. Ward, 392 F.Supp. 628, 631-32 (S.D.N.Y.1975) (Powell I), aff'd as modified,542 F.2d 101\n(2d Cir.1976).\n[18] The Adjustment Committees, which were established through regulations promulgated by the New York\nState Department of Correctional Services, see 7 N.Y.C.R.R. ยง 252.1, consisted of three employees of the penal\ninstitution designated by the prison's superintendent. At Clinton, these committees were commonly manned by a\nlieutenant at the institution, a correctional officer, and a civilian employee. The correctional officer or other\nemployee who reported the incident of inmate misconduct that was the subject of an Adjustment Committee\nproceeding would not be allowed to sit on the Committee considering that incident.\n[19] In determining that the due process principles violated by the procedures followed by the Adjustment\nCommittees were \"clearly established,\" the Second Circuit cited the following decisions: McKinnon v. Patterson,\n568 F.2d 930 (2d Cir.1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 1087, 98 S.Ct. 1282, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978); Mawhinney v.\nHenderson, 542 F.2d 1 (2d Cir.1976); Crooks v. Warne, 516 F.2d 837 (2d Cir.1975); United States ex rel. Walker\nv. Mancusi, 467 F.2d 51 (2d Cir.1972); and Powell I, 392 F.Supp. 628 (S.D.N. Y.1975),aff'd as modified,542 F.2d\n101 (1976).\n[20] Cases from this Circuit included United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 338 F.Supp. 311 (W.D.N.Y.1971)\n(confinement in Attica's special housing unit in wake of Attica riots involved \"harsh reduction\" of privileges, and\nthus cannot be imposed absent minimum procedural safeguards; Sostre procedures deemed adequate), aff'd,\n467 F.2d 51 (2d Cir.1972); Carter v. McGinnis, 320 F.Supp. 1092 (W.D.N.Y.1970) (holding inmates in segregation\nunit without charges being filed against them and without informing them of reasons for such confinement\nviolated inmates' due process rights); and Kritsky v. McGinnis, 313 F.Supp. 1247, 1250-51 (N.D.N.Y.1970) (Foley,\nJ.) (lost good behavior time and segregation, which were deemed \"grievous loss[es],\" cannot be imposed in\nabsence of hearing before impartial decision maker, and decision maker should state his reasons for imposing\npunishment), aff'd sub nom. Rodriguez v. McGinnis, 456 F.2d 79 (2d Cir.1972),rev'd on other grounds sub nom. \nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Cases from outside the Second\nCircuit included United States ex rel. Miller v. Twomey, 479 F.2d 701, 716-19 (7th Cir.1973) (Stevens, J.)\n\n(\"prolonged segregated confinement is a `grievous loss'\" implicating due process concerns), cert. denied,414\nU.S. 1146, 94 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed.2d 102 (1974); Diamond v. Thompson, 364 F.Supp. 659, 664 (M.D.Ala.1973)\n(Johnson, J.) (\"withdrawal of privileges or the imposition of more burdensome conditions of confinement may\nconstitute a grievous loss calling for procedural standards\"); Sands v. Wainwright, 357 F.Supp. 1062, 1082\n(M.D.Fla.) (\"those conditions of human existence which accompany confinement in [disciplinary] segregation ...\nconstitute [a] grievous loss[] ...\"), vacated on other grounds,491 F.2d 417 (5th Cir.1973); and Bundy v. Cannon,\n328 F.Supp. 165, 172-74 (D.Md. 1971) (\"protracted segregated confinement in maximum security quarters\"\nconstituted \"punishment sufficiently severe to require [that] minimum due process standards [be met];\" those\nstandards included written notice of charges prior to hearing).\n[21] So found the court in McKinnon, 568 F.2d at 937.\n[22] After discussing the minimum procedures that the Supreme Court found should be provided in disciplinary\nproceedings implicating serious liberty interests, the Court observed in a footnote that the circuit courts had been\nsplit on this issue. 418 U.S. at 572 n. 20, 94 S.Ct. at 2982 n. 20. Among the cases discussed were Sostre and \nUnited States ex rel. Miller v. Twomey, 479 F.2d 701 (7th Cir.1973),cert. denied,414 U.S. 1146, 94 S.Ct. 900, 39\nL.Ed.2d 102 (1974), an opinion written by Justice Stevens in 1973, when he was still a circuit court judge for the\nSeventh Circuit. In Miller, Judge Stevens noted that the Seventh Circuit, in Adams v. Pate, 445 F.2d 105 (7th\nCir.1971), had followed the Second Circuit's position in Sostre and held that \"if a `prisoner is confronted with the\naccusation against him and afforded a reasonable opportunity to deny the accusation or explain his actions'\nbefore confinement in segregation, `this would appear to fairly and rationally satisfy the concept of procedural\ndue process.'\" Miller, 479 F.2d at 717 (quoting Adams, 445 F.2d at 108). Subsequent to both Sostre and Adams,\nthe Supreme Court decided Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), which\ninvolved the due process requirements for parole revocation proceedings. The Miller court concluded that the\nreasoning of Morrissey brought into question its earlier decision in Adams.479 F.2d at 712. Reexamining the\nquestion of what process is due in prison disciplinary proceedings, Judge Stevens concluded that an inmate is\nentitled to \"an adequate and timely written notice of the charge, a fair opportunity to explain and to request that\nwitnesses be called or interviewed, and an impartial decision maker.\" Id. at 718. These procedural safeguards, of\ncourse, were very similar to those mandated by Wolff. Morrissey, the case relied on in large part in Miller,\nprovided an important underpinning to the Supreme Court's opinion in Wolff a year later. By comparing Miller and\nSostre in that footnote, adopting procedures similar to those required by Miller, and relying to a large extent on\nthe same case which influenced Miller's rejection of Adams and Sostre, the Supreme Court impliedly rejected the\nSostre procedures. In light of this, defendants' reliance on Sostre after Wolff seems imprudent.\n[23]Amato involved a challenge to the procedures followed by the New York Time Allowance Committees in\ncalculating an inmate's \"good time\" allowances. The amount of \"good time\" credited to an inmate determined in\npart his conditional release date. The Court of Appeals held that the Time Allowance Committees were not\n\"disciplinary\" committees subject to the requirements of Wolff. Because the Time Allowance Committees based\ntheir calculation of an inmate's \"good time\" on findings made by disciplinary committees such as the Adjustment\nCommittees, however, the court was required to examine the constitutionality of the manner in which disciplinary\ncharges were handled within New York's prisons.\n[24]But see Salahuddin v. Harris, 657 F.Supp. 369, 374-76 (S.D.N.Y.1987).\n[25] At trial, Morgan admitted that he committed many of the rule violations for which he was cited. For example,\nMorgan concedes that he repeatedly destroyed state property by tearing down nametags placed over his cell,\nthat he repeatedly refused to shave and shower, and that he consistently refused to attend Adjustment\nCommittee hearings (which at the time was itself a rule violation). Morgan indicated that he refused as a \"matter\nof principle\" to place his arms through the bars of his cell prior to having his cell door opened, as was required by\ninstitutional rules for reasons of safety. Admittedly, most of the violations Morgan committed arose out of conduct\nthat outside of the prison context would hardly raise eyebrows. Nonetheless, the regimentation contemplated by\ndetailed institutional rules is vital to the maintenance of order in a correctional facility. Morgan's refusal to follow\nthose rules was unjustified, and it was reasonable that this failure result in disciplinary charges.\n[26] Plaintiff admitted to six rule violations at the Adjustment Committee hearing conducted on February 11, 1975.\nOne week of keeplock confinement was an appropriate sanction for those violations.\n\n[27] For example, plaintiffs did not dispute that they destroyed state property by tearing down nametags that were\nplaced over their cells, that they refused to meet with the Adjustment Committees on occasion, or that they\nrefused to rinse their bowls and eating utensils upon completing their meals, as required by Clinton's institutional\nrules. Plaintiffs also admitted that they refused to shave and shower on occasion. The justifications offered by\nplaintiffs for these infractions were either unreasonable or lacked credibility.\n[28] Specifically, the court believes the testimony of correctional officers concerning use of force incidents\ninvolving each of the plaintiffs. See text, infra at 1046-51. The court also disbelieves plaintiff Morgan's testimony\nconcerning his physical assault of a prison counsellor.\n[29] Similarly, there is no evidence supporting plaintiffs allegation that defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of\ntheir due process rights.\n[30] Former Commissioner Peter Preiser did not hold that office at any point where defendants were not entitled\nto qualified immunity for the due process violations.\n[31] Judge Friendly looked to the due process clause to find a right on the part of prisoners to be free from the\nexcessive use of force by prison officials. The Supreme Court recently indicated that \"the [e]ighth [a]mendment,\nwhich is specifically concerned with the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain in penal institutions, serves as\nthe primary source of substantive protection to convicted prisoners in cases ... where the deliberate use of force\nis challenged as excessive and unjustified.\" Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 327, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1088, 89 L.Ed.\n2d 251 (1986). Substantively, however, the test to be applied remains that which Judge Friendly developed in \nJohnson v. Glick. See475 U.S. at 320-21, 106 S.Ct. at 1084-85.\n[32] During the period in question, correctional officers charged with the responsibility of maintaining order in\nSHU often carried batons or ax handles in performing their duties.\n[33] Plaintiff Goggins did not appear or testify at trial. The transcript of Goggins' deposition testimony was\nadmitted into evidence under Fed. R.Civ.P. 32(a)(3)(B), which provides that \n[t]he deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds\n... that the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the United\nStates, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.\nId. (emphasis added). At the time of trial, Goggins resided in the New York City area, well over 100 miles from\nAuburn, New York, where this matter was tried. The Second Circuit's leading opinion on the admissibility of a\nparty's deposition offered by that party himself is Richmond v. Brooks, 227 F.2d 490 (2d Cir.1955). In Richmond,\nthe court found that the plaintiff had not \"procured\" her absence merely because she resided in another state and\nhad not attempted to be present at trial, and having found this the court had no difficulty finding that the\ndeposition at issue otherwise fell within the abovequoted Rule. Id. at 492-93. Richmond has been consistently\nfollowed in the few cases addressing the admissibility of a party's own deposition under the circumstances of the\npresent case. See, e.g., Nash v. Heckler, 108 F.R.D. 376 (W.D.N.Y.1985); Bellamy v. Molitor, 108 F.R.D. 1\n(W.D.Ky.1983); Houser v. Snap-On Tools Corp., 202 F.Supp. 181 (D.Md.1962). This court followed this precedent\nand allowed plaintiffs to introduce Goggins' deposition into testimony. Nonetheless, it should be noted that in a\ncase like this, where many of the key factual issues turn on the credibility of the witnesses, the inability of the\ncourt to observe the deposition witness's demeanor severely hinders its ability to fulfill its fact-finding\nresponsibility.\n[34] During the period relevant to this lawsuit, it was not unusual for Lieutenants or Sergeants working in Clinton's\nspecial housing units to carry tear gas canisters if permission had been obtained from the institution's watch\ncommander.\n[35] This account is not consistent with the Use of Physical Force report completed at the time of the incident.\nExh. 12. That report indicates that Goggins initiated the altercation by swinging his fist at Woodward, and that\nGoggins resisted the officers as he was taken back to his cell.\n\n[36] This practice was condemned by Judge Foley in Frazier v. Ward, see426 F.Supp. at 1360-67, but plaintiffs\nhave not argued that collateral estoppel, the applicability of which must be affirmatively shown, applies with\nregard to Judge Foley's findings on this issue. See text, supra at 1037.\n[37] Both Hurley I and Frazier v. Ward are distinguishable from the case at bar in that in both cases there was\nevidence that the visual cavity searches were conducted in an abusive manner. There is no credible evidence of\nsignificant physical or verbal abuse in this case.\n[38] The circuit court affirmed the injunction that protected the named plaintiff individually but reversed the district\ncourt's decision to grant class-wide injunctive relief because a class had not been properly certified in that case.\n[39]Campbell addressed a challenge to a policy requiring routine body cavity searches before an inmate would\nbe allowed access to a prison law library. The primary focus of the constitutional attack in that case was the\nplaintiff's right of access to the courts, protected by the fourteenth amendment.\n[40] This extreme deference can be more fully appreciated by reading Justice Marshall's forceful dissent in Bell v.\nWolfish:\nNot surprisingly, the Government asserts a security justification for [the visual body cavity searches]. These\nsearches are necessary, it argues, to prevent inmates from smuggling contraband into the facility. In crediting this\njustification despite the contrary findings of the two courts below, the Court overlooks the critical facts. As\nrespondents point out, inmates are required to wear one-piece jumpsuits with zippers in the front. To insert an\nobject into the vaginal or anal cavity, an inmate would have to remove the jumpsuit, at least from the upper\ntorso.... Since contact visits occur in a glass-enclosed room and are continuously monitored by corrections\nofficers, ... such a feat would seem extraordinarily difficult. There was medical testimony, moreover, that inserting\nan object into the rectum is painful and \"would require time and opportunity which is not available in the visiting\nareas,\" ... and that visual inspection would probably not detect an object once inserted.... Only by blinding itself to\nthe facts presented on this record can the Court accept the Government's security rationale.\n441 U.S. at 577-78, 99 S.Ct. at 1894 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).\n[41]See, e.g., Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983) (routine body cavity searches conducted before and\nafter maximum security prisoner visited law library or received visitors in visiting rooms did not violate fourth\namendment); Daughtery v. Harris, 476 F.2d 292 (10th Cir.) (body cavity search conducted before transfer to\ncustody of United States Marshals for transportation to court upheld), cert. denied,414 U.S. 872, 94 S.Ct. 112,\n38 L.Ed.2d 91 (1973); Bell v. Manson, 427 F.Supp. 450 (D.Conn.1976) (court, in denying preliminary injunction,\nfinds routine strip searches of pretrial detainees upon return to detention center from court constitutional), rev'd,\n590 F.2d 1224 (2d Cir.1978); see also Giampetruzzi v. Malcolm, 406 F.Supp. 836 (S.D. N.Y.1975); Bijeol v.\nBenson, 404 F.Supp. 595 (S.D.Ind.1975); Penn El v. Riddle, 399 F.Supp. 1059 (E.D.Va.1975); compare Hodges\nv. Klein, 412 F.Supp. 896 (D.N.J.1976) (policy of maximum security prison requiring visual body cavity search\nwhen inmate enters or leaves prison or following contact visit with person from outside prison is constitutional, but\npolicy requiring such searches after returning from segregated exercise yard deemed unconstitutional absent\n\"reasonably clear indication\" that inmate is concealing something).\n[42] The drowsiness plaintiffs claim resulted from this involuntary drugging is not evidence of the \"wanton and\nunnecessary infliction of pain\" required by Rhodes, and thus plaintiffs allegations concerning forcible medication,\neven if true, would not state a claim under the eighth amendment. Nonetheless, the right to refuse medical\ntreatment does have a constitutional dimension, \"whether termed a liberty interest protected by the [d]ue\n[p]rocess [c]lause, or an aspect of the right to privacy contained in the notions of personal freedom which\nunderwrote the Bill of Rights.\" United States v. Charters, 829 F.2d 479, 491 (4th Cir.1987). The court's rejection of\nplaintiffs' testimony regarding the involuntary administration of drugs forecloses recovery under either\nconstitutional theory in this case.\n[43] Morgan, Goggins and Born-Allah are black.\n\n[44] In addition to their other challenges to the conditions of confinement within Unit 14, plaintiff's complaint\nalleged that defendants violated plaintiffs' rights of free exercise of religion. The evidence presented at trial was\ntoo sparse to support those claims.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
