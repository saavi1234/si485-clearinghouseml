We do not have a copy of the complaint; therefore, the exact allegations involved are unknown.  However, it appears from the consent decree that the complaint alleged the defendant terminated the charging party, a female employee, in retaliation for her complaints of sexual harassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The defendant filed a motion to dismiss in August of 2002 which was denied in February of 2003.  Following a successful and unopposed partial motion for summary judgment filed by the EEOC in July 2003 and granted in August 2003, the parties settled the dispute in October 2003 through a consent decree.  </p><p>The decree, based upon independent verification of the defendant's representations that its business had closed, would remain closed, and that it had no assets to be liquidated to collect a judgment, dismissed the action with reservation of the right to reinstitute litigation should the defendant reopen its business.</p><p></p>",

Civil  Action  N6l)>'::W~:Ce~:.i12'if1'?;1l[ pun \nBGS  TELEMARKETING,  INC. \nMEMORANDUM \nBefore  the  Court  is  Defendant's  Motion  to  Dismiss,  or  in  the \nAlternative,  to  Compel  Mandatory  Conciliation.  Paper  No.9.  The \nmotion  is  fully  briefed.  Upon  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the \napplicable  case  law,  the  Court  determines  that  no  hearing  is \nnecessary  and  that  the  motion  should  be  denied. \nThe  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  brings  this \naction  alleging  that  Defendant  maintained  a  sexually  hostile \nenvironment  in  its workplace  and  that  it retaliated  against  at \nleast  one  female  employee  for  raising  complaints  about  that \nenvironment.  The  suit  is  filed  on  behalf  of  ten  named  female \nemployees  or  former  employees,  as  well  as  other  unnamed  female \nemployees.  Defendant  has  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint  on  the \nground  that  the  EEOC  \"failed  to  participate  in  any  realistic \nconciliation process  .  and  therefore  denied  Defendant  a \nrealistic  opportunity  to  resolve  the  issues  between  the  parties.\" \nMotion  at  1.  Defendant  also  complains  that  the  Complaint  lacks \nspecificity.  Neither  argument  has  merit. \nThe  EEOC  investigation was  initiated when  Grace  Hughey,  a \n\nformer  employee  of  Defendant,  filed  a  formal  complaint.  Hughey \nalleged  that  her  second  line  supervisor,  Clayton  Mills,  made \ninappropriate  sexual  comments  to  her  and  other  female  employees. \nShe  also  stated  that  when  she  complained  about  his  conduct,  she \nwas  fired.  On  February  13,  2002,  the  EEOC  issued  a  Letter  of \nDetermination  in which  it  concluded  that  \"[t]he  evidence  revealed \nthat  [Hughey]  and  her  female  co-workers  were  indeed  subjected  to \nsexual  harassment,  a  sexually hostile  work  environment,  and  that \n[Defendant]  failed  to  take  immediate  and  appropriate  action.\" \nDe f . 's Exh.  A.  Furthermore,  the  EEOC  found  that  Hughey's \ndischarge  on  the  grounds  of  poor  work  performance  was  pretextual \nand  that  the  real  motivation  was  retaliation  for  complaining \nabout  sexual  harassment. \nOn  February  21,  2002,  the  EEOC  sent  a  letter to  Defendant \ndetailing  the  remedial  actions  that  it believed  to  be \nappropriate.  These  actions  included  training  for  employees  and \nsupervisors,  the  posting  of  appropriate  information,  the \ndevelopment  of  an  effective  complaint  procedure,  and  the  payment \nof  \"up  to  $50,000\"  in  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  to  each \nidentified  class  member,  in  addition  to  a  back  pay  award  for \nHughey.  Def.'s  Exh.  B.  Defendant  was  instructed  to  respond  to \nthis  letter by  March  4,  2002,  if  it was  willing  to  enter  into  a \nconciliation agreement. \n2 \n\nOn  March  20,  2002,  Defendant  sent  a  response  indicating  its \nwilling  to  agree  to  each  of  the  non-monetary  remedial  measures, \nbut  offered  nothing  by  way  of  compensatory  or  exemplary  damages. \nDef. 's Exh.  C.  On  April  8,  2002,  the  EEOC  responded,  stating \nthat  its position was  that  monetary  relief  for  Hughey  and  the \nidentified  class  members  must  be  a  part  of  any  conciliation \nagreement.  Def.'s  Exh.  D.  The  EEOC  warned  that  if Defendant  was \n\"unwilling  to  provide  an  amount  for  monetary  relief  for  [Hughey] \nand  the  identified  class  members,  then  it will  be  determined  that \nefforts  to  conciliate  this  charge  have  been  unsuccessful  and  the \ncase  will  be  referred  to  this  office's  Legal  Unit  to  determine \nwhether  EEOC  will  bring  a  civil  action  in  Federal  District \nCourt./f  Id. \nOn  April  17,  2002,  Defendant  replied,  stating  that  it was \nwilling  to  pay  a  lump  sum  of  $5000  as  compensatory  damages,  to  be \ndistributed  in  any  manner  desired  by  the  EEOC.  Def.'s  Exh.  E. \nOn  May  8,  2002,  the  EEOC  sent  a  letter rejecting  that  offer,  and \nindicating  that  it considered  further  conciliation efforts \n\"futile  and  non-productive./f  Def.'s  Exh.  F.  The  EEOC  then  filed \nthe  instant  action  on  July  16,  2002. \n\"Before  bringing  suit,  the  EEOC  must  make  a  good  faith \neffort  to  conciliate  the  claim./f  E.E.O.C.  v.  Keco  Industries, \nInc.  748  F.2d  1097,  1102  (6t.h  Cir.  1984).  This  Court's  review  of \n3 \n\nthe  conciliation process,  however,  is  quite  limited.  \"The \ndistrict  court  should  only  determine  whether  the  EEOC  made  an \nattempt  at  conciliation.  The  form  and  substance  of  those \nconciliations  is within  the  discretion of  the  EEOC  as  the  agency \ncreated  to  administer  and  enforce  our  employment  discrimination \nlaws  and  is  beyond  judicial  review.\"  Id. \nThe  Court  finds  that  the  EEOC  made  a  sincere  and  reasonable \neffort  to  negotiate  in good  faith,  thereby  fulfilling  its \nobligations.  In  response  to  the  EEOC's  finding  of  a  hostile \nworkplace  and  the  retaliatory discharge  of  one  of  its employees, \nDefendant  initially offered  no  monetary  compensation,  whatsoever. \nDefendant  came  back  a  second  time  with  what  could,  In  the  context \nof  the  EEOC's  findings,  be  considered  nothing  more  than  a  nominal \noffer.  The  Court  cannot  conclude  that  it was  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion  for  the  EEOC  to  conclude  at  that  point  that  any \nfurther  negotiations  would  be  futile. \nThe  Court  also  rejects  Defendant's  argument  that  the \nComplaint  lacks  sufficient  specificity in  its allegations.  The \nSupreme  Court  recently  clarified  the  degree  of  detail  that  must \nbe  included  in  a  complaint  of  discrimination.  Swierkiewicz  v. \nSorema  N.  A.,  122  S.  Ct.  992  (2002).  As  with  any  other  plaintiff \nin  a  civil  action,  a  plaintiff  bringing  a  claim of  discrimination \nmust  simply give  a  short  and  plain  statement  of  the  claim  showing \n4 \n\nthat  he  is  entitled to  relief.  122  S.  Ct.  at  995.  This,  the \nEEOC  has  done. \nA  separate  order  will  issue. \nWilliam  M.  Nickerson \nSenior  United  States  District  Judge \nS \nDated:  February  2003 \nI \n5 ",

(BGS) alleging that\nBGSโs supervisors sexually harassed its female employees in\nviolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as\namended, 42 U.S.C. 2000e, et seq.  Plaintiff also alleges that\nBGS discharged one of its employees, Grace Hughey, in\nretaliation for her complaints about this harassing conduct. \nPlaintiff has now moved for summary judgment on the issue of\nliability.  Paper No. 21.  The time for opposing the motion\nhas now passed, and the Court has been informed that BGS does\nnot intend to file any opposition.\nThe evidence submitted by Plaintiff, which is now\nundisputed, conclusively demonstrates that BGSโs female\nemployees were subjected to severe and pervasive harassment on\naccount of their gender, and that BGS was aware of that\nharassment but took no measures reasonably designed to prevent\nthat harassment.  The evidence submitted by Plaintiff also\nstrongly supports the conclusion that Hugley was terminated\n\nfor protesting that unlawful conduct.  In the absence of any\nevidence disputing that of Plaintiff, the Court will grant\nsummary judgment in favor of Plaintiff as to liability on both\nthe hostile environment and retaliation claims.   See Smith v.\nFirst Union Nat. Bank, 202 F.3d 234, 241 (4th Cir. 2000)\n(setting out the elements of a hostile environment claim) and\nVon Gunten v. Maryland, 243 F.3d 858, 863 (4th Cir. 2001)\n(setting out the prima facia case for retaliation claim).  \nAccordingly, IT IS this 15th day of August, 2003, by the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland,\nORDERED:\n1. That Plaintiffโs Motion for Partial Summary\nJudgment, Paper No. 21, is GRANTED;\n2.   That a telephonic scheduling conference will be held\non Wednesday, August 27, 2003, at 9:45 a.m., to be initiated\nby counsel for Plaintiff, for the purpose of setting a date\nfor a trial at which the amount of damages and other\nappropriate relief will be determined;  and\n3.   That the Clerk of the Court shall transmit copies of\nthis Memorandum and Order to all counsel of record.\n/s/\n                                  \n \nWilliam M.
