The docket is the only available document for this case and it is uncertain what the EEOC claimed as causes of action.  Lawry's Restaurants, Inc. filed a motion for summary judgment in November 2006, which was granted in part on January 26, 2007 such that the class the EEOC purported to represent would be limited to those individuals the EEOC could show 1) had an interest in being a server and were denied or refrained from applying during the statutory filing period, 2) the class of people the EEOC could collect back pay for two years, and 3) were from the class of people that the EEOC could collect compensatory and punitive damages.</p><p></p>",

Lawryโs, a California-based corporation,\noperates restaurants in Las Vegas, Nevada, Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and\nCorona del Mar, Calif.\nIn its lawsuit, the EEOC alleges that Lawryโs instituted a policy of hiring only women for server positions in\n1938 and failed to update the antiquated policy with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOCโs\nsuit, (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Lawryโs Restaurants Inc., d/b/a Lawryโs The Prime\nRib, et al., CV 06-1963 DDP (PLAx)) was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California after\nthe federal agency first attempted to reach a voluntary settlement. The EEOCโs suit seeks back pay and\ncompensatory and punitive damages, in addition to remedial relief.\nโLawryโs practice of hiring only women as servers, with their period costumes, pre-dates the landmark Civil\nRights Act of 1964,โ said EEOC Los Angeles Regional Attorney Anna Y. Park. โNonetheless, the practice of\ndenying men the opportunity to work in the higher-paying server jobs is blatant sex discrimination. An\nemployer as large and sophisticated as Lawryโs should certainly know better and act better.โ\nOlophius Perry, Director of the Los Angeles District Office, said, โWith the enactment of Title VII, all\nemployers are obliged to survey their employment practices to ensure that they are in compliance. We\nencourage employers in the restaurant industry to be proactive in stamping out stereotype biases that\nrestrict employment opportunities based on gender, race, ethnicity or other protected characteristics.โ\nEEOC is the federal agency responsible for enforcing the nationโs anti-discrimination laws in the workplace.\nFurther information about the EEOC is available on its web site at www.eeoc.gov\nThis page was last modified on April 4, 2006.\n Return to Home Page\n1 of 1 5/16/2007 3:10 PM",

Both parties  are  engaged  in \n23  settlement  negotiations  and  agreed  to  submit  this pure  question of \n24  law  to  the  Court  to determine  the  scope  of  the  action.  After \n25  reviewing  the  parties'  submissions,  the  Court  is  inclined to grant \n26  the  motion  in part  and  adopt  the  following  order. \n27  DOCKETED ON eM \n28 \nJAM 2 9 2007 \n(\\..  .//1 \nBY'--\".,  V 17  145 \n(J \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 2 of 12(cid:10)\n1  I.  BACKGROUND \nc\\ \nllJ \n2 \n)i \n-'-I' \n3  The  plaintiff Equal  Employment  Opportunity Commission  (tli~,  \n\" \nv) \n4  \"EEOC\")  brings  suit under  Section  706(f) (1)  and  707  of  Title VII  of \n5  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  codified as  amended  at  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง \n6  2000e-5(f) (1)  & -6,  against  the  defendant,  Lawry'S  Restaurants \n7  d/b/a Lawry'S  The  Prime  Rib,  Five  Crowns,  and  Tam  O'Shanter  Inn \n8  (\"Lawry's\"),  for  unlawful  employment  discrimination on  the  basis  of \n9  gender.  See  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000e-2(a) (1). \n10  Lawry's  operates  a  chain of  restaurants  that  originated  in \n11  Beverly Hills,  California  in  1922.  (Defendant's  Statement  of \n12  Uncontroverted  Facts  (\"DUF\")  ~~ 5-7)  Lawry's  provides  a \n13  distinctive  tableside  service maintained by  three  types  of \n14  employees:  \"carvers ,\"  who  slice meat  at  the  table;  \"servers,\"  who \n15  make  salads  at  the  table  and  provide  other waitstaff  services;  and \n16  \"helpers,\"  who  act  primarily as  bussers.  (DUF  14-19,  Mot.  at  3.) \n~~ \n17  Since  Lawry'S  founding,  it has  maintained  a  policy of  only hiring \n18  women  to be  servers.  (DUF  ~  10.)  As  justification,  Lawry'S  cites \n19  the  unique  and  historic  \"Harvey Girls\"  uniform worn  by all  servers. \n20  (DUF  ~~ 11  &  12.) \n21  Brandon  Little was  employed  by Lawry's  in Las  Vegas,  Nevada  as \n22  a  helper.  (Lindsay Decl.  Ex.  1  at  1  (Little's EEOC  charge).)  When \n23  he  applied  to be  a  server,  Little's application was  denied  on  the \n24  grounds  he  was  not  qualified,  since  he  could not  wear  the  \"Harvey \n25  Girls\"  uniform  skirt.  (Lindsay  Decl.  Ex.  2  at  6  (Defendant's \n26  Position Statement  to EEOC).)  On  March  2,  2003,  Little  filed  a \n27  complaint  with  the  Nevada  Equal  Rights  Commission  and  the  EEOC  on \n28  behalf  of  himself  and  all  similarly situated males  denied  or \n2 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 3 of 12(cid:10)\n1  discouraged  from  employment  as  servers  in all Lawry's  restaurants. \nC\\ \n2  (Lindsay Decl.  Ex.  1.)  lU \n:;~: \n::ยฃ,~ \n3  The  EEOC,  after  investigation and  conciliation efforts,  ,:( \nu \nv> \n4  brought  this  suit  on  behalf  of  Brandon  Little and  a  class  of  male \n5  employees,  alleging that  since at  least  1964,  Lawry'S  impermissibly \n6  refused  to hire males  for  the  position of  server.  (Compl.  \"  8  & \n7  9.)  After  this Court  rejected defendant's  motion  to dismiss,  the \n8  parties  reentered  settlement  negotiations,  where  a  dispute  arose  as \n9  to  the  scope  of  actionable  claims  for  back  pay by  the  EEOC. \n10  (Notice  of  Mot.)  Lawry's  claims  it cannot  be  held  liable  for  any \n11  claims  of  back  pay by  anyone  not  hired and  able  to bring a  claim \n12  within  300  days  of  Little's March  2,  2003  charge.  (Mot.  at  2.) \n13  The  EEOC  counters  that  it should be  able  to bring claims  for  back \n14  pay  for  any employee  whose  rights  were  violated  from  the  passage  of \n15  Title VII  in 1964  to  the  present.  (Opp.  at  3.) \n16 \n17  II.  DISCUSSION \n18 \n19  Summary  Judgment  Standard \n20  Summary  judgment  is appropriate  where  \"the  pleadings, \n21  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file, \n22  together with  the  affidavits,  if any,  show  that  there  is no  genuine \n23  issue as  to  any material  fact  and  that  the  moving  party  is entitled \n24  to a  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law.\"  Fed.  R.  civ.  P.  56(c}.  In \n25  determining  a  motion  for  summary  judgment,  all  reasonable \n26  inferences  from  the  evidence  must  be  drawn  in favor  of  the \n27  nonmoving  party.  Anderson  v.  Liberty Lobby.  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242, \n28  255  (1986).  Both  parties have  agreed  to  the  pertinent  material \n3 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 4 of 12(cid:10)\n1  facts  in  their pleadings,  thus  summary  judgment  should be  granted \n{;'~ \n2  to Lawry's  if,  as  a  matter  of  law,  its position  is correct  an<i);it \n3  is entitled to  judgment  .  ;::r \nt;, \n4 \n5  EEOC's  Power  under  Title VII \n6  Title VII  as  amended  gives  the  EEOC  broad enforcement  power  to \n7  litigate  in the public  interest against  private parties  engaging  in \n8  employment  discrimination.  See  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000e-5  & _6 ;  EEOC  v. \n'\n9  Waffle  House,  534  U.S.  279,  286  (2002)  (quoting Gen.  Tel.  Co.  v. \n10  EEOC,  466  U.S.  318,  326.  (1980)).  After  the  EEOC  is  informed  of \n11  potential discrimination by  the  filing  of  a  charge,  it must  conduct \n12  an  investigation  to determine  if reasonable  cause  exists and \n13  \"endeavor  to eliminate  any  such alleged unlawful  employment \n14  practice by  informal  methods  of  conference,  conciliation,  and \n15  persuasion.\"  EEOC  v.  Shell  Oil  Co.,  466  U.S.  54,  88  (1984).  If \n16  conciliation  fails,  the  EEOC  may  bring  suit  in federal  court \n17  seeking appropriate  legal  and  equitable  relief  ranging  from \n18  compensatory and  punitive damages  to  injunctive,  declaratory,  and \n19  affirmative  relief.  ยงยง  1981a (a) (1),  2000e-5 (g) . \n20  When  Title VII  was  passed  in 1964,  individuals  were  granted \n21  the  right  to  sue  for  individual  actions  under  section  706  (now  ยง \n22  2000e-5)  after exhausting  an  administrative  remedy.  The \n23  government,  in the person  of  the Attorney General,  was  given  in \n24  section  707  (now  ยง  2000e-6)  the  power  to  sue  parties  engaged  in a \n25  \"pattern or  practice of  resistence  to  the  full  enjoyment  of  any  of \n26  the  rights\"  secured  in Title VII  by  filing  suit.  When  Congress \n27 \nIn  the  remainder  of  the  Court's  opinion,  all  statutory \n28  citations  are  to Title 42,  United  States  Code. \n4 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 5 of 12(cid:10)\n1  amended  the  statute  in  1972,  the Attorney General's  power  was \nd \n2  transferred  to  the  EEOC.  See  Pub.  L.  No.  92-261  codified as  LlJ \n;::~ \n-'.oJ;! \n3  amended  ยง  2000e-6(c).  Since  1972,  the  EEOC  has  been  charged  wtth \nI,.) \n4  protecting  the public  interest against  employment  discriminati8n by \n5  private parties. \n2 \n6  The  Supreme  Court  has  noted  that when  the  EEOC  brings  suit,  it \n7  \"does  not  function  simply as  a  vehicle  for  conducting  litigation on \n8  behalf  of  private parties.\"  Occidental  Life  Ins.  Co.  v.  EEOC,  432 \n9  U.S.  355,  368  (1977).  Rather,  the  EEOC  is charged  to  \"vindicate \n10  the  public  interest  in preventing employment  discrimination.\"  Gen. \n11  Tel.,  446  U.S.  at  326.  That  charge  has  led the  Supreme  Court  to \n12  exempt  the  EEOC  from  individual  statutes  of  limitation,  Occidental \n13  Life,  432  U.S.  at  368,  and  from  the  strictures  of  Federal  Rule  of \n14  Civil  Procedure  23  for  class  certification,  Gen.  Tel.,  446  U.S.  at \n15  324.  More  recently,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  a  private charging \n16  party's agreement  to  submit  to arbitration could not  devolve  the \n17  EEOC  of  its ability to bring  suit.  Waffle  House,  534  U.S.  at  288. \n18  While  the  EEOC's  power  is broad,  it is not  indefinite.  Title \n19  VII's  primary purpose  is prophylactic;  \"it aims,  chiefly,  not  to \n20  provide  redress  but  to avoid  harm.\"  Kolstad v.  Am.  Dental  Ass'n., \n21  527  U.S.  526,  545  (1999)  (internal  quotations  omitted).  To  that \n22  end,  Congress  has  limited  the  scope  of  available monetary  relief \n23  under  Title VII.  Under  the  Civil  Rights  Amendments  of  1991,  Pub. \n24  L.  No.  102-166  codified as  amended  at  ยง  1981a,  damages  are  limited \n25  to  $200,000  per  injured party for  employers  with more  than  200  but \n26 \nBy  Executive  Order  No.  12068,  (June  30,  1978)  President \n27  2 \nCarter,  using  the power  of  the  Reorganization Act,  transferred  the \npower  to  sue  state and  local  governments  for  employment \n28  discrimination back  to the  Attorney General. \n5 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 6 of 12(cid:10)\n1  fewer  than  500  employees,  ยง  1981a(1)3,  For  back  pay awards,  Title \n1::1 \n2  VII  limits  the  available  scope  for  any party to  \"two  years  pri.'\"o   r to \n~., \n;:~t \n3  the  filing  of  the  charge  with  the  Commission,\"  ยง  2000e-5 (g) (:t;j. \nu \n4 \n5  Back  Pay  Relief \n6  Back  pay  relief  involves  complex  inquiry and  computation by \n7  the  court  consistent with  the Supreme  Court's  seminal  ruling  in \n8  International  Brotherhood  of  Teamsters  v.  United  States,  431  U.S. \n9  324  (1977).  The  awarding  of  back  pay supports  Title VII's \n10  prophylactic  objectives by  deterring employers  from  engaging  in \n11  unlawful  practices  and  providing victims  an  incentive  to bring \n12  charges.  See,  e.g.,  Albemarle  Paper  Co.  v.  Moody,  422  U.S.  405, \n13  421  (1975).  That  objective  is  further  supported by  the  two-year \n14  limitation contained  in the  statute,  which  courts  have  held  applies \n15  to private  litigants and  the  EEOC  alike.  See  United  States v.  Lee \n16  Way  Motor  Freight,  Inc.,  625  F.2d  918,  933-34  (10th  Cir.  1979); \n17  EEOC  v.  Occidental  Life  Ins.  Co.,  535  F.2d  533,  540  (9th  Cir.  1976) \n18  aff'd on  other grounds  432  U.S.  355  (1977).  Thus,  at  a  very \n19  minimum,  the  plain language  of  section  2000e-5{g) (I)  would  limit \n20  the  potential  EEOC  recovery  to back  pay  for  the prospective  class \n21  to March  2,  2001,  or  two  years  before  Little filed  his  charge.' \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nAt  argument,  counsel  for  the  EEOC  noted  that  there  is not  a \ntime  restriction  for  the  computation  of  compensatory and  punitive \n26  damages.  This  appears  to be  correct;  the  two  year  limitation of  ยง \n27  2000e-5{g)  by  its own  terms  applies  only  to back  pay. \n,  This  language  forecloses  the  EEOC's  argument  that  it should \n28  be  able  to  recover  from  the passage  of  Title VII  in  1964. \n6 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 7 of 12(cid:10)\n1  Scope  of  Relief \nc~ \n2  Lawry's  asks  this  Court  to  limit  its potential  back  pay \nti'J \n;,~~ \n~.~~ \n3  liability to  300  days  prior  to the  filing  of  the  Little  charge;:! \nu \n(r\\ \n4  Lawry's  cites  to National  Railroad  Passenger  Corp.  v.  Morgan,  536 \n5  U.S.  101  (2002)  for  the proposition that  a  discrete  act,  such as  a \n6  decision not  to hire  or  not  to promote,  cannot  be  part  of  a \n7  \"continuing violation,\"  as  claimed by  the  EEOC.  Lawry's  further \n8  cites  to Ninth  Circuit  cases  post-Morgan  declining  to  impose  back \n9  pay  liability for  actions  occurring prior to  the  \"effective \n10  limitation period.\"  See  Cherosky v.  Henderson,  330  F.3d  1243, \n11  1247-48  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (\" [I] f  the  mere  existence  of  a  policy is \n12  sufficient  to  constitute a  continuing violation,  it is difficult  to \n13  conceive  of  a  circumstance  in which  a  plaintiff's claim  of  unlawful \n14  employment  policy  could be  untimely. II);  Lyons  v.  England,  307  F. 3d \n15  1092,  1107  (9th  Cir.  2002)  (noting  if a  plaintiff chose  to bring \n16  discrete act  suits  individually,  it would  not  establish a  pattern \n17  granting  liability outside  the  limitation period);  Domingo  v.  New \n18  England  Fish Co.,  727  F.2d  1429,  1443  (9th Cir.  1984)  (\"It  follows \n19  that,  as  a  prerequisite  to obtaining  relief,  each  class  member  must \n20  demonstrate,  by  fact  of  employment  or otherwise,  that  he  or  she  had \n21  been  discriminated against  during  the  limitation period  or was  a \n22  member  of  a  group  exposed  to discrimination during  that  time.\") . \n23  Each  of  the  cases  cited by Lawry's  is easily distinguishable \n24  with one  simple  fact:  not  one  involves  a  suit by  the  EEOC  in the \n25  public  interest.  As  the  Supreme  Court  recognized  in Waffle  House, \n26  the  EEOC's  claim  is not  \"merely derivative\"  of  the  original  charge. \n27  Waffle  House,  534  U.S.  at  297.  Lawry's  is,  in essence,  making  the \n28  same  argument  that  was  unsuccessful  in Waffle  House:  that  the  EEOC \n7 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 8 of 12(cid:10)\n1  should,be  prohibited  from  seeking victim-specific  relief  of \nbecau~e \n(:~ \n2  policies  applied  to  the  individual  who  made  the  initial EEOC  ~ft \n3  charge. \nI)') \n4  Where  the  Court  differs  with Lawry's  is on what  constitutes an \n5  \"injury\"  when  the  EEOC  brings  a  pattern-or-practice  claim.  As  the \n6  Supreme  Court  noted  in Morgan  itself,  there  is an  important \n7  distinction between  a  private  litigant and  the  EEOC  when  defining  a \n8  \"practice\"  for  the  purposes  of  individual  suits.  When  defining \n9  what  an  unlawful  employment  \"practice\"  was  for  an  individual \n10  bringing  suit  in Morgan,  the  justices  looked  to  Section  707's  grant \n11  to  the Attorney General  of  power  to bring  \"pattern or practice\" \n12  suits  to note  that  practice  was  singular.  Morgan,  536  U.S.  at  Ill. \n13  This  observation  indicates  that  the Attorney General's \n14  authorization in section  707  is  to bring  suits  for  patterns of \n15  illegal behavior.  Compare  ยง  2000e-5(b)  with  ยง  2000e-6(a).  The \n16  Attorney General's  power  to bring pattern suits  is now  vested  in \n17  the  EEOC.  ยง  2000e-6(c).  That  is precisely what  the  EEOC  is doing \n18  in this  instance. \n19  This  formulation  of  the  case  is entirely consistent  with  the \n20  Supreme  Court's  ruling  in Bazemore  v.  Friday,  487  U.S.  386  (1986). \n21  In  Bazemore,  the  Supreme  Court  invalidated a  discriminatory salary \n22  structure  that paid black  employees  less  than white  employees.  The \n23  Court  noted  that  \"each week's  paycheck  that  delivers  less  to a \n24  black  than  to a  similarly situated white  is a  wrong  actionable \n25  under  Title VII.\"  Id.  at  395.  This  definition of  the  injury was \n26  made  in  response  to  the  defendant's  argument  that  the policy was \n27  not  illegal  since  it was  enacted prior  to Title VII.  Id.  at  394. \n28  The  Court  rejected that  argument,  instead noting  the wrong  accrued \n8 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 9 of 12(cid:10)\n1  each  time  the policy was  implemented.  In  this  case,  the  wrong  by \nr~ \n2  Lawry's  accrues  each  time  and  every day a  male  is given differeht \n. \n~; \n, 't' \n3  responsibilities  simply because  of  his  gender.  ~;~ \n4  While  Lawry's  does  cite  to  favorable  opinions  involving  EIEJ~O  C \n5  suits  from  other district courts,  namely  EEOC  v.  Optical  Cable \n6  Corp.,  169  F.  Supp.  2d  539  (W.D.  Va.  2001)  and  the  unpublished \n7  decision  in EEOC  v.  Custom  Companies.  Inc.,  No.  02  C 3768,  2004  WL \n8  765891  (Apr.  7,  2001  N.D.  Ill.),  those  opinions  are  not  binding  and \n9  the  Court  respectfully disagrees  with  those  opinions.  Rather,  the \n10  Court  agrees  with  the  disposition  in EEOC  v.  Autozone.  Inc.,  258  F. \n11  Supp.  2d  822,  832  (W.D.  Tenn.  2003),  which  held  that  the  EEOC  was \n12  empowered  to  collect back  pay to the  two-year  limit  of  ยง  2000e-5(g) \n13 \n14  Thus,  the  only  clear  limitation on  the  scope  of  back  pay \n15  relief available  to  the  EEOC  is  the  unambiguous  limitation found  in \n16  the  statute  itself.  No  party may  collect  back  pay more  than  two \n17  years  prior to  the  initial charge.  ยง  2000e-5(g) (1).  This  Court  is \n18  obliged  to give  full  effect  to all words  used by Congress  where \n19  possible.  v.  Capital  Credit  & Collection Servs.,  Inc., \n~,Clark \n20  460  F.3d  1162,  1175  (9th Cir.  2006).  Were  the  EEOC  limited to \n21  collecting back  pay awards  only for  actions  occurring within  the \n22  300  days  (or  180  days  in non-deferral  states),  that  two-year \n23  limitation would  be  rendered  a  nullity. \n24 \n25  Class  Membership \n~ \n26  Thus,  the  question  remaining  is whether  the  class of \n27  individuals  for  which  the  EEOC  may  collect  backpay awards  must  be \n28  limited,  as  Lawry's  argues,  to those  injured within  the  300  days \n9 \n\n\" \nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 10 of 12(cid:10)\n1  preceding  Little's charge,  that  is those men  injured after May  6, \ndt \n2  2002. s  The  Court  here  agrees  with Lawry's.  The  rule \nestablis~~d \n~:; \n3  by  the  Ninth Circuit  is clear that,  in order  to be  a  member  olP/the \n'oi \n4  class,  a  putative member  must  demonstrate  some  injury within  ilie \n5  300  day  filing period. \n6  It  is uncontested  that  Lawry's  had  an  openly discriminatory \n7  policy of  refusing  to hire males  to  server positions  in effect  at \n8  least  since  1964.  This  pattern of  illegal behavior  serves  as  a \n9  consistent  and  ongoing  injury against  the male  employees  of  Lawry's \n10  every day  it remains  in effect.  Each  day Brandon  Little walked \n11  into work,  he  knew  he  was  unable  to move  up  from  the  helper  to  the \n12  server position.  His  application  for  the  job would  have  been \n13  futile.  Though  interested,  he  was  deterred  from  applying  every day \n14  he  entered the  restaurant  and  was  reminded  of  Lawry's \n15  discriminatory policies. \n16  This  situation is completely opposite  what  the  Supreme  Court \n17  handled  in Morgan.  There,  the  defendant  complained  of  sporadic \n18  discrimination by his  supervisors  that  prevented his being promoted \n19  and  provided  for  a  hostile work  environment.  This  situation also \n20  different  from  Cherosky:  the  Court  there  admitted no  policy \n21  existed.  Thus  to  the  extent  the  case  speaks  to policies,  that \n22  language  is dicta. \n23  This  situation is much  like  the  one  in Teamsters,  where  the \n24  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  company's  assertion that  a  person had \n25  not  actually applied  for  the  job  in the  face  of  a  discriminatory \n26 \n27 \nThough  Lawry's  papers  indicate  the  date  should be  May  5, \n5 \n28  2002,  the  Court  agrees  with  the  EEOC  that  the  300th day  before \nMarch  2,  2003  is May  6,  2002. \n10 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 11 of 12(cid:10)\n1  policy was  not  a  bar  to  recovery.  Teamsters,  431  U.S.  at  365. \nt:~ \n2  Such an  application would  be  a  \"futile gesture\"  or  \"vain gestur,e  in \n~.::. \n:~ \n3  light  of  employer  discrimination.\"  Id.  at  366.  To  remedy, \nthe~ \nl) \n4  Court  allowed  recovery  for  an  employee  or applicant  who  can \n5  establish a  prima  facie  case  by  showing  both  that  he  had  a  real  and \n6  present  interest  in  the  job and  that  he  refrained  from  applying \n7  based  on  a  justifiable belief  that  such  an  application was  futile. \n8  The  case  most  on  point  with  the  present  is EEOC  v.  Joe's  Stone \n9  Crabs,  Inc.,  296  F.3d  1265  (11th  Cir.  2002).  In  Joe's,  the \n10  Eleventh  Circuit post-Morgan  dealt with an  implicit  policy at  a \n11  famous  Miami  restaurant  that  only hired men  to be  servers.  The \n12  court  faced  a  similar  situation  faced  by  this Court  today:  how  to \n13  limit  the  appropriate  scope  of  back pay and  class membership.  The \n14  court  in Joe's  held  that  the  \"futile gesture\"  doctrine  both \n15  survived Morgan  and  would  satisfy the  \"injury\"  requirement  within \n16  the  filing period.  296  F.3d  at  1274.  A similar  rule makes  sense \n17  here.  Lawry's  actively discouraged  applications with  its \n18  discriminatory policies.  Lawry's  should  not  be  rewarded  for  having \n19  an  overt policy by being  granted  some  degree  of  amnesty  against \n20  those  who  did not  file  an  actual  application within  the  300-day \n21  filing period.  Thus,  where  the  EEOC  can  show  a  male  employee  or \n22  applicant  had  both  a  real  and present  interest  in the position of \n23  server  and  that  he  was  deterred  from  applying  by Lawry'S \n24  discriminatory policies  after May  6,  2001,  that man's  claim is \n25  timely.  Cf.  Pickern v.  Holiday Quality Foods.  Inc.,  293  F.3d  1133, \n26  1136  (9th  Cir.  2002)  (applying  the  \"futile gesture\"  doctrine  from \n27  Title VII  jurisprudence  to  the Americans  with Disabilities Act) ; \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 42     Filed 01/26/2007     Page 12 of 12(cid:10)\n1  The  Eleventh  Circuit  in  Joe's  limited back  pay  recovery to  the \nn \n2  time  of  a  \"roll  call,\"  or  annual  hiring time  at which  Joe's  St6ne \n., \n\", A \n3  Crabs  hired all of  its servers,  that  fell  in the  300  day peri6~. ~d  . \n\\.! \n4  Lawry's  has  not  presented evidence  of  any  such a  system. \n5  Accordingly,  the  maximum  limitation on  back pay  the  EEOC  could \n6  recover,  as  noted  above,  is two  years  before  the  filing  of  the \n7  charge,  or March  2,  2001. \n8 \n9  III.  Conolusion \n10 \n11  Accordingly,  the  Court  is inclined to grant  defendant's  motion \n12  for  partial  summary  judgment  to  the  extent  that  the  following \n13  restrictions are  made: \n14  l)The  class  represented  by  the  EEOC  is limited  to  those \n15  individuals  the  EEOC  can  show  1)  had  a  real  and  present  interest  in \n16  being a  server and  2)  either were  denied  that  job or  refrained  from \n17  applying  due  to  futility during  the  300-day  statutory filing \n18  period. \n19  2)  From  that  class,  the  EEOC  may  collect  back  pay  for  the  two \n20  years  preceding  the  filing  of  the  initial  charge. \n21  3)  From  that  class,  the  EEOC  may  collect  compensatory and \n22  punitive  damages  to  the  extent  they are  consistent  with  applicable \n23  law. \n24 \n25  IT  IS  SO  ORDERED. \n26 \nuOffi1~ \n27  Dated: \nDEAN  D.

BACKGROUND \n24  The  United  States  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (the \n25  \"EEOC\")  brings  suit  against  Lawry's  Restaurants,  Inc.,  d/b/a \n26  Lawry's  The  Prime  Rib,  Five  Crowns,  and  Tam  O'Shanter  Inn \n27  (collectively  \"Lawry's\")  on  behalf  of  Brandon  Little and  similarly \n28  situated males.  The  EEOC  alleges  that  Lawry's  engaged  in a \n~, -~~~ \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 17     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 2 of 5(cid:10)\n1  or practice  of  refusing  to  hire men  as  servers  in  its restaurants \n2  nation-wide  in violation of  Title VII,  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000e-2(a) (1) \n3  and  -6. \n4 \n5  II.  DISCUSSION \n6  A.  Legal  Standard \n7  The  EEOC  must  conduct  an  investigation when  an  individual \n8  files  charges  of  employment  discrimination.  If  the  EEOC  determines \n9  that  reasonable  cause  exists  to  believe  that  the  charge  is  true,  it \n10  \"shall  endeavor  to  eliminate  any  such  alleged unlawful  employment \n11  practice  by  informal  methods  of  conference,  conciliation,  and \n12  persuasion.\"  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000e-S(b).  The  EEOC  may  bring  suit \n13  against  the  employer  if  it  is unable  to obtain  a  conciliation \n14  agreement  that  it deems  acceptable.  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000e-S(f) (1). \n15  Genuine  investigation,  reasonable  cause  determination  and \n16  conciliation are  jurisdictional  conditions  precedent  that  the  EEOC \n17  must  satisfy before  it may  bring  suit.  EEOC  v.  Pierce  Packing  Co., \n18  669  F.2d  60S,  607  (9th  Cir.  1982). \n19  B.  Analysis \n20  Lawry's  argues  that  the  Court  should  dismiss  this  action \n21  because  the  EEOC  did  not  conciliate  in good  faith  in violation of \n22  the  statutory requirements.  (Mot.  1.) \n23  On  August  26,  2003,  the  EEOC  issued  a  determination  letter \n24  stating  that  there  was  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  Lawry's  had \n25  discriminated against  Little  and  a  class  of  similarly situated \n26  males.  (Lindsey  Decl.  Ex.  3.)  The  EEOC  invited Lawry's  to \n27  participate  in  settlement  discussions.  On  May  6,  2004,  the  EEOC \n28  sent  Lawry's  a  conciliation proposal  detailing  the  monetary  and \n2 \n\n., \nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 17     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 3 of 5(cid:10)\n1  non-monetary  relief  that  it was  seeking  from  the  company.  (rd. , \n2  Ex.  4.)  On  August  18,  2004,  Lawry's  sent  the  EEOC  a \n3  counterproposal  that  contained  no  offer of  monetary  relief.  (Karen \n4  Decl.,  Ex.  4.)  Lawry's  also  proposed  that  the  class  definition \n5  exclude  bussers.  The  parties met  and  discussed  the \n6  counterproposal,  and  on  October  4,  2004,  Lawry's  sent  the  EEOC \n7  another  proposal.  (Lindsey  Decl.,  Ex.  5.)  The  new  proposal \n8  contained an  offer of  monetary  relief  but  the  figure  was \n9  significantly less  than  the  amount  initially proposed  by  the  EEOC. \n10  Further,  Lawry's  still  sought  to  exclude  bussers  from  the  class \n11  definition.  Over  the  next  five  months,  the  parties  engaged  in \n12  discussions  and  exchanged  letters  in  an  attempt  to  settle the \n13  matter.  On  March  28,  2005,  the  EEOC  sent  Lawry's  another \n14  counterproposal,  and  Lawry's  responded  with  a  letter dated April \n15  12,  2005,  in which  it rejected the  new  offer.  (Karen  Decl.,  Exs. \n16  F,  G.) \n17  After  more  than  one  year  of  conciliation negotiations,  the \n18  parties  remained  far  apart  on many  issues,  including  the  amount  of \n19  damages  for  the  class  and  for  Little.  Accordingly,  on  July 19, \n20  2005,  the  EEOC  informed  Lawry'S  that  further  settlement  efforts \n21  would  be  futile  and  that  conciliation had  failed.  (rd.,  Ex.  L.) \n22  The  Fifth and  Eleventh  Circuits  have  held  that  the  district \n23  court  must  examine  the  substance  of  the  parties'  negotiations  in \n24  determining  whether  the  EEOC  has  complied  with  its duty  to \n25  conciliate.  Specifically,  the  district  court  must  determine \n26  whether  the  EEOC  acted  reasonably during  the  conciliation process. \n27  EEOC  v.  Asplundh  Tree  Expert  Co.,  340  F.3d  1256,  1259  (11th  Cir. \n28  2003);  EEOC  v.  Klinger  Elec.  Corp.,  636  F.2d  104,  107  (5th  Cir. \n3 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 17     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 4 of 5(cid:10)\n1  1981).  However,  several  other circuits  have  adopted  a  more \n2  preferable  approach.  These  courts  have  held  that  the  EEOC \n3  satisfies  the  conciliation condition  in  ยง  2000e-5(b)  if  it provides \n4  the  employer  an  opportunity  to confront  all  the  issues.  EEOC  v. \n5  Delight  Wholesale  Co.,  973  F.2d  664,  669  (8th  Cir.  1992);  EEOC  v. \n6  Keco  Indus.,  Inc.,  748  F.2d  1097,  1l01-02  (6th  Cir.  1984)  (\"The \n7  EEOC  is under  no  duty  to  attempt  further  conciliation after an \n8  employer  rejects  its offer.\");  EEOC  v.  St.  Anne's  Hosp.,  664  F.2d \n9  128,  131  (7th  Cir.  1981);  EEOC  v.  Zia  Co.,  582  F.2d  527,  533  (lOth \n10  Cir.  1978).  Under  this  approach,  the  district  court  does  not \n11  examine  the  substance  of  the  parties'  negotiations. \n12  The  Ninth  Circuit  has  not  considered  this  issue.  However, \n13  district  courts  within  the  Ninth  Circuit  have  adopted  the  majority \n14  approach  and  have  held  that  the  district  court  should  focus  on \n15  whether  the  EEOC  provided  the  employer  with  an  opportunity  to \n16  confront  all  the  issues.  See.  e.g.,  EEOC  v.  Canadian  Indemnity \n17  Co.,  407  F.  Supp.  1366,  1367  (C.D.  Cal.  1976).  This  approach \n18  comports  with  the  statutory  language  in Title VII,  which  gives  the \n19  EEOC  discretion  in determining  whether  a  conciliation agreement  is \n20  acceptable.  See  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000e-5(f) (1).  Consequently,  the \n21  Court  considers  whether  the  EEOC  provided Lawry's  with  an \n22  opportunity  to  address  and  resolve  the  issues  in  this  lawsuit  prior \n23  to  the  EEOC  filing  suit. \n24  Lawry's  argues  that  EEOC  did not  negotiate  in good  faith by, \n25  among  other  things,  conditioning  conciliation of  the  class  claims \n26  on  successful  settlement  of  Little's  claims.  (Mot.  13-16.) \n27  However,  Lawry's  does  not  deny  that  it and  the  EEOC  spent  several \n28  months  attempting  to  resolve  the  issues  raised  in  this  lawsuit \n4 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-01963-DDP-PLA     Document 17     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 5 of 5(cid:10)\n1  prior to  the  EEOC  initiating  litigation.  Given  the  efforts  to \n2  settle  this  matter,  the  EEOC  has  fulfilled  its duty of \n3  engaging  in  reconciliation prior  to  filing  suit.  Further,  it is \n4  unnecessary  to  stay the  proceedings  pending  further  conciliation \n5  efforts because  the  parties have  reached  an  impasse  on  a  variety of \n6  issues  and  additional  settlement  discussions  would  be  futile. \n7 \n8  III.  CONCLUSION \n9  The  Court  denies  the  defendant's  motion. \n10 \n11  IT  IS  SO  ORDERED. \n12 \n13  p~~ \n14  Dated: \nDEAN  D.
