Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against the four charging parties (Black security guards) on the basis of their race, color, and national origin by paying them less than other lighter-skinned employees who were performing essentially the same work.  The parties reached a settlement through a consent decree in August 2004, about two weeks after the suit was filed.  The three-year decree, containing non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the defendant to post a Title VII notice, provide annual Title VII training for all employees, distribute its anti-discrimination policy to its employees, provide the charging parties with neutral references, and pay $57,000 to be distributed among the four charging parties. The decree was entered in 2004 and scheduled to last 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.",
