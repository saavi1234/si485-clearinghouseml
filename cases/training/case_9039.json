Duffyโs Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir. 1998).\n(c) Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(a):  Appeals are permitted from orders โgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving\ninjunctions or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions...โ and from โ[i]nterlocutory decrees...determining the rights and liabilities of parties\nto admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.โ  Interlocutory appeals from orders denying temporary restraining orders are\nnot permitted.\n(d) Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(b) and Fed.R.App.P.5:  The certification specified in 28 U.S.C. Section 1292(b) must be obtained\nbefore a petition for permission to appeal is filed in the Court of Appeals.  The district courtโs denial of a motion for certification is not itself\nappealable.\n(e) Appeals pursuant to judicially created exceptions to the finality rule: Limited exceptions are discussed in cases including, but not limited\nto: Cohen V. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541,546,69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949); Atlantic Fed. Sav. & Loan Assโn\nv. Blythe Eastman Paine Webber, Inc., 890 F. 2d 371, 376 (11th Cir. 1989); Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 157, 85 S. Ct.\n308, 312, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964).\n2. Time for Filing: The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.  Rinaldo v. Corbett, 256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001).  In civil\ncases, Fed.R.App.P.4(a) and (c) set the following time limits:\n(a) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1): A notice of appeal in compliance with the requirements set forth in Fed.R.App.P. 3 must be filed in the district court within\n30 days after the entry of the order or judgment appealed from.  However, if the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, the notice\nof appeal must be filed in the district court within  60 days after such entry.  THE NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED AND FILED IN THE\nDISTRICT COURT NO LATER THAN THE LAST DAY OF THE APPEAL PERIOD - no additional days are provided for mailing.\nSpecial filing provisions for inmates are discussed below.\n(b) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(3): โIf one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when\nthe first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period ends later.โ\n(c) Fed.R.App.P.4(a)(4): If any party makes a timely motion in the district court under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a type specified in\nthis rule, the time for appeal for all parties runs from the date of entry of the order disposing of the last such timely filed motion.\n(d) Fed.R.App.P.4(a)(5) and 4(a)(6): Under certain limited circumstances, the district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal.  Under\nRule 4(a)(5), the time may be extended if a motion for an extension is filed within 30 days after expiration of the time otherwise provided to file\na notice of appeal, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.  Under Rule 4(a)(6), the time may be extended if the district court finds\nupon motion that a party did not timely receive notice of the entry of the judgment or order, and that no party would be prejudiced by an extension.\n(e) Fed.R.App.P.4(c): If an inmate confined to an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil case or a criminal case, the notice of appeal is\ntimely if it is deposited in the institutionโs internal mail system on or before the last day for filing.  Timely filing may be shown by a declaration\nin compliance with 28 U.S.C. Section 1746 or a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class\npostage has been prepaid.\n3. Format of the notice of appeal: Form 1, Appendix of Forms to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, is a suitable format.  See also Fed.R.App.P. 3(c).\nA pro se notice of appeal must be signed by the appellant\n4. Effect of a notice of appeal: A district court loses jurisdiction (authority) to act after the filing of a timely notice of appeal, except for actions in aid of\nappellate jurisdiction or to rule on a timely motion of the type specified in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).\nRev.: 4/04\n-3-",

The employment of Intervenors\nEverett and Luther was terminated in 2005.  Intervenorsโ claims\nof retaliation have not been added to the Complaint at this time.\n \n\nCase 8:05-cv-01813-EAK-TGW     Document 33      Filed 07/07/2006     Page 2 of 2\nCase No. 8:05-CV-1813-T-17TGW\nIn Case No. 8:05-CV-2358-T-17, the Complaint is based on\nwrongful discharge.  Plaintiff alleges his employment was\nterminated in 2004 for complaining about sexual harassment of\nother employees.\nThe Court recognizes that there are some common questions of\nfact, and it appears there will be common questions of law. \nHowever, each Plaintiff will still have to prove each individual\nclaim.   Consolidation will not necessarily result in improved\neconomy and efficiency because of the factual differences between\nthe claims.   The Court also recognizes that separate trials will\navoid various logistical problems associated with the\npresentation of evidence.   After consideration, the Court denies\nthe Motion to Consolidate.  Accordingly, it is\nORDERED that the Motion to Consolidate is denied.       \n \n  DONE and ORDERED in Chambers, in Tampa, Florida on this\n7th day of July, 2006.\n     \nCopies to:\nAll\nparties and counsel of record\n2",
