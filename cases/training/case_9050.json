In October 2004 the parties settled the case through mediation and a consent decree was issued.The consent decree stated that the defendant must (1) revise its current nondiscrimination policy to produce an environment free of retaliation and discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, or religion; (2) post notices of the new policy and deliver the new policies to current employees and new employees; (3) train all its employees, including management, on the issues concerning all types of employment discrimination; (4) keep records of all postings and training so the EEOC may inspect the records yearly; (5) and pay the aggrieved employees a total sum of $65,000 (division unknown).The decree was entered in 2004 and scheduled to last 2007.
