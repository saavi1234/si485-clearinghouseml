The court's orders of 12/19/03 and 1/22/04 remain as they along with previous extensions in this case, are more than sufficient to allow for full and complete discovery. Mr. Shortman's bill is a separate issue and as stated in the 12/19/03 order, the parties should schedule a conference with Christian Murray once its been paid, clearly the parties responsibility.

The Court will, as usual in this case, be available to hear the parties' positions. But the record established so far rellects vast inefficiency and over litigating by both sides both before the Court and the Magistrate and it would be inappropriate to inflict such an approach upon a jury. The Court will reconsider reasonable recommendations from the parties but its ruling re: the jury instructions (which are potently unworkable) and the PTO (which suggests lack of trial understanding and felixibility) remains. they are rejected and revised versions are due as ordered. Agains, see FRCP 1 & 11 re: any failure(s) to comply. This letter from EEOC will not substitute for compliance, and respectfully, misconsture the public interest. (Signed by Judge Richard M.

    "summary": "In September 2001, the New York District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Morgan Stanley & Co, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  We do not have a copy of the complaint; therefore, the exact allegations involved are unknown.  However, it appears from an EEOC press release that the complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against the charging party, a female employee, and up to one hundred other women on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the defendant had a practice of paying female employees less than males for equal work and by restricting their opportunities for promotion and advancement.  The charging party intervened in the suit in October 2001.  After some scheduling orders and discovery, the defendant filed a motion for partial summary judgment in November 2002 which was denied in December.  The parties participated in several settlement conferences throughout March, April, and May 2003.  After several more motions for summary judgment, the parties submitted a proposed consent decree to the court in July 2004.  In September 2005, the court finally approved the terms of the consent decree, and the case was settled. The decree has a duration of three years and contained non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses.  In addition, the decree required the defendant to: pay $54 million, provide anti-discrimination training, appoint an ombudsperson to implement the decree, report to the EEOC annually, and hire an outside monitor to review its anti-discrimination policies and procedures. Additionally, the defendant was required to implement programs to increase the promotion opportunities of high performance female employees.The decree was entered in 2004 and scheduled to last 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.",

      "text": "EEOC LITIGATION SETTLEMENT REPORT - July 2004 http://www.eeoc.gov/litigation/settlements/settlement07-04.html\nEEOC v. Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.\nNo. 01-8421 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 2004)\nThe New York District Office filed this sex discrimination action, alleging that defendant, a global\nfinancial services firm with more than 600 offices in 27 countries, engaged in a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination against female employees in its Institutional Equity Division (IED). New York alleged\nthat the unlawful practices affected the women's promotion opportunities, compensation, and terms,\nconditions, and privileges of employment. New York further alleged that the defendant retaliated\nagainst the charging party-intervenor, a principal in the firm, by terminating her for complaining about\nsex discrimination.\nThis case was resolved by a three-year consent decree that requires defendant to pay a total of $54\nmillion. Forty million dollars will be paid into a claim fund to pay awards through a process by which\nclaimants and the parties will submit information to a Special Master, paid by defendant, who will\ndetermine the amount, if any, to be awarded to each claimant. Any claimant dissatisfied with the\nSpecial Master's determination as to her claim can submit objections to the court. Potential claimants\nare women employed in the United States at any time since January 1, 1995, in IED in the positions of\nexempt non-officers eligible for promotion to vice president (including but not limited to associate and\nprofessional), vice president, principal or executive, and managing director, and female American\ncitizens employed in these covered positions outside the United States during that period. Any residual\nfunds from the $40 million will be used for scholarship programs for female students pursuing careers\nin the financial services industry. Defendant also is to pay $12 million to CP and to use $2 million to\nprovide anti-discrimination and diversity training and to implement policies and programs designed to\nprevent sex discrimination and enhance promotional opportunities for women.\nAdditionally, defendant will appoint an employee to be an EEOC-approved ombudsperson who will\noversee the implementation of the decree's terms, administer defendant's complaint policy, and\nensure compliance with recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The decree also provides for an\noutside monitor, paid by defendant, who will review defendant's anti-discrimination policies and\npractices and be a contact person for employees with sex discrimination complaints. The outside\nmonitor also will provide a report to EEOC and defendant, at least once a year, that assesses\ndefendant's implementation of and compliance with the decree, with special attention to whether\ndefendant has implemented meaningful programs to address retention and promotion of women in\nIED. Finally, the decree enjoins defendant from discriminating against women in covered positions in\npromotion and compensation based on their sex and from retaliating against female employees, and\nprovides for yearly reporting to EEOC on the sex, job title, and compensation of employees in covered\npositions, on transfers and hires into covered positions, and on studies of promotions of employees in\ncovered positions.\n1 of 1 5/30/2007 3:53 PM",

The suit also alleges that Morgan Stanley retaliated against Ms.\nSchieffelin, and ultimately fired her, after she voiced her opposition to discriminatory practices at the firm.\nEEOC filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The suit charges Morgan Stanley with having engaged in a pattern or\npractice of discrimination against women in the Institutional Equity Division who held positions as associate, vice\npresident, principal, and managing director by compensating them less than their male colleagues and by limiting their\nopportunities for professional advancement.\n\"By advancing free marketplace principles, Wall Street has led our nation to its position of global economic\npreeminence,\" said EEOC Chair Cari Dominguez. \"Our laws and our citizens now demand that those same principles that\nhave worked so well in the marketplace be applied to the workplace. This Agency is fully committed to ensuring that all\nAmericans have the freedom to compete - the freedom to compete in the workplace on a level playing field. I urge the\nsecurities industry - and all employers - to continue to take an aggressive, proactive role in removing workplace barriers,\nwhether attitudinal or organizational, that deprive women of the freedom to compete and to achieve to their fullest\npotential.\"\nAccording to Spencer H. Lewis, Jr., director of the agency's New York District Office, which investigated and attempted\nto settle the case prior to filing suit, \"Morgan Stanley systematically denied opportunities for equal compensation and\nadvancement to a class of professional women. By filing this pattern or practice case the EEOC seeks to remedy these\nillegal practices and send a message that discrimination will not be tolerated in this or any other industry.\"\nEqually troubling to the EEOC is the evidence of retaliation against Ms. Schieffelin. \"When she spoke out against the\ndiscrimination, Morgan Stanley made a bad situation worse by punishing her for exercising her federally protected\nrights,\" said the office's Regional Attorney Katherine Bissell. \"The EEOC cannot allow retaliation to stand because it\nimpedes our ability to investigate and enforce the law. We hope that by filing this lawsuit others who believe they have\nbeen discriminated against will feel that they can come forward and share their experiences and concerns.\"\nIn addition to enforcing Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or\nnational origin, EEOC enforces the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; the Equal Pay Act; Title I of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act, which prohibits employment discrimination against people with disabilities in the private sector and\nstate and local governments; prohibitions against discrimination affecting individuals with disabilities in the federal\ngovernment; and sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

High Impact Litigation - Highlights for 2004\nCertain cases by virtue of their size, amount and type of relief, or industries or individuals affected are of\nparticular importance in redressing discriminatory practices. In this section of the Annual Report, we review\nhighlights from some of FY 2004's high impact resolutions.\n1. Sex Discrimination\nThe Commission secured a number of multimillion dollar recoveries in cases involving sex discrimination,\ndemonstrating the continuing battle of women to be judged on their competencies rather than stereotypes\nabout their gender, and to work in an environment free from offensive sexual conduct. The year's largest\nrecovery $54 million was in a suit against the financial services firm of Morgan Stanley, alleging that the\nfirm engaged in a pattern or practice of sex discrimination in its Institutional Equity Division by preventing\nwomen from being promoted, compensated, or enjoying other terms, privileges and conditions of\nemployment on the same basis as men. The case was resolved by a 3-year consent decree, with $40 million\ngoing to a claim fund to pay identified victims; $12 million to the individual who filed the discrimination\ncharge leading to the suit (who intervened adding other claims); and $2 million for training designed to\ncombat discrimination and enhance promotional opportunities for women. As part of the extensive injunctive\nrelief provided in the decree, Morgan Stanley will appoint an EEOC-approved ombudsperson to oversee\nimplementation of the decree, and will retain an outside monitor to review Morgan Stanley's\nantidiscrimination policies and be a point of contact for sex discrimination complaints.
