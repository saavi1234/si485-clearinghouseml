The case settled during a settlement conference, and the court entered a consent decree in December 2004. </p><p>The two year consent decree required the defendant to refrain from discrimination and retaliation, pay the claimants $50,000, post notice, keep record of complaints of racial/national origin harassment complaints, allow the EEOC to review its compliance, give the EEOC reports every six months on any complaints of racial/national origin harassment, and provide training for all employees on racial harassment and the prevention of such harassment.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiff  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (the  \"EEOC\")  fIled  a \nComplaint in this action alleging that since at least 1998, Defendant, Regal-Beloit Corporation \n(\"Defendant\" or \"Regal\"), violated Section 703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \namended (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.c. § 2000e-2(a), by discriminating against Charging Party Christopher \nNowak (\"Nowak\") on the basis of his national origin,  and a class of former employees (\"the \n. claimants\") on the basis of race and national origin.  Specifically, the EEOC alleged that Defendant, \nat its Foote-IoneslIllinois Gear production facility located in Chicago, Illinois, violated Title VII by \nfostering or tolerating a hostile working environment on account of race and national origin.  Regal \ndenies these allegations.  Nothing in this Consent Decree should be construed as an admission by \nany party regarding liability or non-liability. \n\nCase 1:04-cv-02706     Document 17     Filed 12/13/2004     Page 3 of 14(cid:10)\n2.  In the  interest  of resolving this  matter,  and  as  a result of having engaged in \ncomprehensive settlement negotiations, the parties have agreed that this action should be finally \nresolved by entry ofthis Consent Decree (hereafter \"Decree\"). This Decree fully and finally resolves \nany and all issues and claims arising out of the Complaint filed by the EEOC in this action. \nFINDINGS \n3.  Having carefully examined the terms and provisions of this Decree, and based on the \npleadings, record, and stipulations ofthe parties, the Court finds the following: \na.  This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action and over the \npersons of the parties. \nb.  The terms ofthis Decree are adequate, fair, reasonable, equitable, and just. \nThe rights of the parties, Nowak, and the other claimants, and the public interest are adequately \nprotected by this Decree. \nc.  This Decree conforms with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Title VII \nand is not in derogation of the rights or privileges of any person.  The entry of this Decree will \nfurther the objectives of Title VII and will be in the best interests ofthe parties, Nowak, and the other \nclaimants, and the public. \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT: \nNON-DISCRIMINATION \n4.
