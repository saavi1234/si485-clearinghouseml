The case settled during a settlement conference, and the court entered a consent decree in December 2004. </p><p>The two year consent decree required the defendant to refrain from discrimination and retaliation, pay the claimants $50,000, post notice, keep record of complaints of racial/national origin harassment complaints, allow the EEOC to review its compliance, give the EEOC reports every six months on any complaints of racial/national origin harassment, and provide training for all employees on racial harassment and the prevention of such harassment.</p><p></p>",

Specifically, the EEOC alleged that Defendant, \nat its Foote-IoneslIllinois Gear production facility located in Chicago, Illinois, violated Title VII by \nfostering or tolerating a hostile working environment on account of race and national origin.  Regal \ndenies these allegations.  Nothing in this Consent Decree should be construed as an admission by \nany party regarding liability or non-liability. \n\nCase 1:04-cv-02706     Document 17     Filed 12/13/2004     Page 3 of 14(cid:10)\n2.

This Decree conforms with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Title VII \nand is not in derogation of the rights or privileges of any person.
