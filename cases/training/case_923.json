    "summary": "<p>On November 4, 1970, the Imprisoned Citizens Union, an unincorporated association composed of prisoners of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The plaintiffs, represented in part by the American Civil Liberties Union, alleged that the defendants had violated their constitutional rights by failing to furnish them with necessities for personal hygiene (like shampoo, deodorant, razor blades, razors, toothbrushes, and toothpaste), placing them in disciplinary solitary confinement for as long as seven years at a time without notice or a hearing, and failing to give them notice of the rules that govern their conduct in the prison or what punishments are to be imposed for infractions.  They also complained of confinement in filthy, vermin-infested subterranean dungeons, lack of ventilation, lack of bedding, lack of adequate clothing, starvation diets, sack of sanitation, harassment and assault with weapons and chemicals, physical assaults by goon squads of custodial personnel, lack of a law library, cutting them off from communicating with news media, lack of exercise, invasion of privacy by reading and restricting their mail, refusing to allow them to read books, magazines, newspapers, instructional materials, and public documents, providing no light source within the cell, as well as lack of educational programs, rehabilitation, and vocational training.  The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants would transfer them for the malicious purposes of isolating them from their families and their attorneys, causing them to lose seniority in the inmate population's programming, and intimidating them to prevent them from exercising their constitutional rights.  The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants also provided inadequate medical care, arbitrarily and capriciously required them to ingest tranquilizing drugs like Thorazine, and punished plaintiffs who refused to take the medicine.  They claimed that the ingestion of such drugs on a continual, daily basis caused permanent mental imbalance to members of the plaintiff class.  They claimed that the defendants failed to provide prosthetic devices such as false teeth and eyeglasses to plaintiffs who required them.  They claimed that the prisons were controlled by racist prison officials who deliberately instigated and provoked racial tensions, riots, and interracial violence by enforcing discriminatory and racist policies.  Finally, they claimed that the defendants forced them to submit to arbitrary strip searches, vandalize their cells, and restrict their visitation privileges.</p><p>On December 20, 1977, the parties agreed and stipulated that the defendants would provide a law library with specified books for the defendant population. </p><p>Three similar cases (Owens v. Murdock, Ray v. Rundle, and Bracey v. Prasse) were consolidated with this case, and on April 8, 1976, the parties entered into a consent decree, which the District Court (Judge Joseph Simon Lord III) approved on May 22, 1978.  Under the decree, the defendants agreed to promulgate an official code of conduct covering all aspects of institutional life relating to the conduct of residents and officials involved in the prison system.  The code was to specify, among other things, the prison rules, the disciplinary system, levels of punishment, and a fair system of hearings.  The decree also covered health care, mail, clothing, hygiene items, use of physical and chemical restraints (like mace), searches of the residents and their cells, visitation, lighting, toilets in each cell, running water in each cell, ventilation, transfers between prisons, clothing, and retaliation against prisoners who exercise their right to sue.</p><p>On June 7, 1978, the District Court (Judge Lord) settled the issues not covered under the consent decree, ruling that the conditions in the maximum security areas at Graterford, Dallas, and Muncy did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  The Court found that the three cells at Huntingdon known as the \"Glass Cage\" were constitutionally unacceptable and ordered them closed.  The Court further found that the prohibition against conjugal visitation at each of the state prisons did not offend the Constitution.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 451 F.Supp. 894 (E.D.Pa. 1978).</p><p>Rather than closing the \"Glass Cage,\" the defendants alleged that the constitutional defects in those cells had been cured, and they asked the court to dissolve that part of the injunction.  On November 20, 1978, the District Court (Judge Lord) held that because of physical and procedural improvements, the use of the cells no longer violated the Constitution, and the Court dissolved that part of the injunction.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 461 F.Supp. 522 (E.D.Pa. 1978).</p><p>The plaintiffs asked the Court to award them their attorneys' fees, and on June 18, 1979, the District Court (Judge Lord) held that the plaintiffs were entitled to have the defendants pay all of their fees.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 473 F.Supp. 1028 (E.D.Pa. 1979).</p><p>On June 30, 1982, the parties agreed and stipulated that they wanted the Court to dispose of any outstanding contempt claims that the plaintiffs had made against the defendants.  In return, the defendants agreed to reorganize the Hearing Committee, replacing all current members and instituting new procedures that the plaintiffs considered to be fair.  This stipulation was amended one month later, with minor changes to the makeup of the Hearing Committee and its procedures.  </p><p>On July 30, 1982, the parties also agreed that the plaintiffs would not object to the defendants' standard cell check procedures, so long as the defendants would not use cell searches for the purpose of harassing inmates.  </p><p>In the years following the adoption of the consent decree, the Court received a large number of inmate letters complaining that the decree was being repeatedly violated.  The defendants asked the court to dismiss all allegations of contempt.  The Court charged U.S. Magistrate Judge William F. Hall, Jr. with the duty to investigate the complaints to see whether they had merit.  On May 4, 1983, Judge Hall submitted his report and recommendation to the District Court, recommending that the District Court grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaints.  One week later, the District Court (Judge Lord) approved and adopted the Magistrate's recommendation.  </p><p>On June 8, 1988, the District Court again awarded the plaintiffs their attorneys' fees, finding that the plaintiff attorneys had done an excellent job at representing their clients in this litigation.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, No. 70-3054, 1988 WL 59270, (E.D.Pa. Jun. 8, 1988).  </p><p>In 1991, Donald Jones, a Pennsylvania inmate, attempted to bring a contempt claim against the defendants, but the District Court (Judge Fullam) dismissed the complaint for lack of venue, advising the plaintiff to re-file the complaint in one of the other district courts.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, No. 91-0217, 1991 WL 16720, (E.D.Pa. Feb. 5, 1991).  </p><p>After a string of similar individual claims of contempt, the District Court (Judge Jan E. DuBois) held on December 9, 1996, that only allegations of institution or system-wide violations of the decree could be considered as the basis for contempt proceedings, and that the class counsel had to bring such allegations, rather than individual plaintiffs.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 977 F.Supp. 335 (E.D.Pa. 1996).</p><p>In 1998, the defendants asked the Court to terminate the consent decree pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).  The plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that the PLRA was unconstitutional.  On May 4, 1998, the District Court (Judge DuBois) held that the PLRA was constitutional and granted the request to terminate the decree.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 11 F.Supp.2d 586 (E.D.Pa. 1998).  The plaintiffs appealed.  On February 25, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Judge Samuel Alito) affirmed the District Court's termination of the decree.  Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 169 F.3d 180 (3rd Cir. 1999).</p><p></p>",

June 7, 19 73\n• Plaintiffs, twenty-one individual prisoners and\nIs an unincorporated  association of prisoners of the Commonwealth.\no of Pennsylvania  incarcerated at six state penitentiaries,  brought\n\"D\nthis  class action in 1970.—  Plaintiffs 'represent a class con-\n<u\nO\nprising all persons who are now or will be incarcerated in the\no.:\nE\nPennsylvania  State Correctional  Institutions at Graterford,\nDallas, Huntingdon, Kuncy, Rockview and Pittsburgh.  Defeadsr.ts\nare elected and appointed  officials of the Cormo-wealth  and its\nprison  systera.  The complaint attacks conditions ar.d policies at\neach of the prisons as being violative of 42 U.S.C. SS 19S2,  19E3,\nand 1988 as well as the First, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendnents of the United States Constitution. We have  juris die tier.\nunder 28 D.S.C. 5 1343.\nHost of the issues raised in the complaint are the\nsubject matter of a consent decree  entered  into by the parties and\napproved by me on May 22, 1?7S.  However, two areas of  contention\nwere orsitted fron settlement and instead have been  litigated.\nThese complaints  involve the constitutionality  of conditions in\n1/  Several  other  suits brought by state prisoners  have  been\nconsolidated with  this original  action  (C.A. S70-3C5O\nand have been  resolved by the Consent Decree or tried in\nthis  adjudication.\nn' w\nTT\n\nthe ms-xircu-T security cell blocks at four state penitentiaries\nand of the prohibition in all the institutions against conjugal\nvisits.  We visited the four cell blocfcs in q-uesticn in August\n1974 and again in August 1975.  We reserved ruling on these tvo\nissues, pending our decision to approve the consent decree.\nWe conclude that the conditions in the niajciaur: security\nareas at Graterford, Dallas and Muncy do not constitute cruel and\nt\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eigfiti and Fourteenth Aziend-\nrcents.  However, the three cells at Huntingdon known as the \"Glass\nCage\" are constitutionally unacceptable and must be closed.  Ve\nalso conclude that the prohibition against sexual visitation at\neach of the state institutions does not offend the Constitution.\nIn determining the constitutionality of prison con-\nditions, federal courts must allow state penal officials broad .\nlatitude in determining how to administer and regulate the prison\nenvironment in light of recognized penological goals of deterrence,\nrehabilitation and institutional security.  Jones v. North Carolina\nPrisoners' Labor Union, Inc.,  U.S.  , 53 L.Ed. 2d 629,\n£38-39  £1977);  Pell v. Procur.ier, 417 U.S. 817, 822-26  (1S74);\nProcur.ler v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 356, 404-05  (1974),  The court cannot\ndictate to state officials the conditions which the court na.y fee.1,\nas a matter of enlightened and advanced prison theory, should prevail\nin state penitentiaries.  .£_££ Knuckles v. Prasse, 302 F. Sup?. 1C3S,\n1048  (E.D. Pa. 1969), af f'd, 435 F.2d 1255 {3d Cir. 1S70), cert.\ndenied, 403 U.S. 936 (1971).  However, 'judicial restraint car^-.ot\nencompass any failure to take cognizance of valid constitutional\nclains,* Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 4 05, and therefore the\ncourt should not hesitate to remedy conditions which amount to cruel\nand unusual punishment.\nThe Eighth Anendasr.t defies precise definition because\nit \"oust draw its Cleaning frc~ the evolving standards of decency\n\nthat m^rk the progress of a maturing society.\"  Trop v. Dulles,\n3S6 U.S. 86, 101 (19SS).  In the context of prison conditions\nthere are three criteria of the Eighth Anendne.it which njight be\napplied.  If an imxate can demonstrate that penal conditions\nviolate any one of these tests, the condition ir.ust be invalidated.\nThe first criterion is the classic standard that penal\nconditions are proscribed which violate \"the dignity of nan\", Trcp\nv. Dulles, 356 U.S. at ICO;  Hove11 v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272, 230\n(3d Cir. 1972}, that is conditions which are \"so barbarous that\n[they offend] society's evolving sense of decency\", Hadeau v.\n, 561 F.2d 411, 413 (1st Cir. 1977), which involve \"physical\nand mental abuse or corporal punishment of such base, inhumane, ar.d\nbarbaric proportions so as to shock and offend a court's sensibil-\nities,\" Bums v. Swenson, 430 F.2d 771, 778 (8th Cir. 1970), cert.\ndenied, 404 U.S. 1062 (1972), or which involve \"unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain,\" Estelle v. Gamble, 429 D.S. 97, 103 (1976)\nThe second criterion is that punishment which is grossly\ndisproportionate to the offense which precipitated that sanction is\nviolative of the Eighth Amendment.  Weens v. United States, 217 U.S.\n349, 368 (1910).  This test has been applied in challenges to the\ntype of punishment imposed, Grecg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173, 1S7\n(1976) (death penalty);  Trop v, Dulles, 356 U.S. at 100 (denational-\nization); and to the duration or conditions of pur.ishaent, Do^ey v.\nPerini,  518 F.2d 1288, 1290 (6th Cir.), vacated, 423 U.S. 953 {1S7S1;\nO'Brien v. Moriarty, 489 F.2d 941, 944 (1st Cir. 1974) (duration cf\nsolitary confinement);  Hart v. Coiner, 483 F.2d 136, 139-43 (4th\nCir. 1973), cert, denied, 415 U.S. 938, rehearing denied, 416 o.s.\n916 (1974);  LaReau v. MacOoucall, 473 F.2d 974, 978 n.S (2d Cir.\n1972), cert, denied, 414 U.S. 878 (1973) (strip cell grossly severe\nfor prison infraction).\nr\n\nThe third criterion of the Eighth Amendment has\nevolved in more recent decisions ar.d requires that punishment\nmust not go beyond legitimate penal objectives, i.e., the punish-\nner.t must bear a rational relationship to the accomplishment of\npenological goals which are of sufficient importance to justify\nits severity.  See Ovens-El v. Robinson, 442 F. Sup?. 136S, 1384-S5\n(tf.D. Pa. 1978);  Inmates, D.C. Jail v. Jackson, 416 F. Supp. 119,\n122 (D.D.C. 1976);  Padgett 7. Stein, 406 F. Supp. 237, 293  (K.D.\nPa. 1975);  Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F. Eupp. 674, 679 (N.D.Cal.*\n1966).  The Third Circuit has adopted an analogous position in\nKovell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272 (3d Cir. 1972), in which the court'\nstated:\n\"A punishment may be cruel and unusual\nwhen, although applied in pursuit of a\nlegitimate penal aim, it goes beyond\nvhat is necessary to achieve that aim;\nthat is, when a punishment is unnecessar-\nily cruel in view of the purpose for which\nit is used.\"  Id. at 2B1, quoting from\nJordan v. Fitzharris, 257 T~. Supp. at 679.\nAt least  five members of the Supreme Court recently\nhave accepted the •penological objectives\" criterion.  In Grecc v.\nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153  (1976), Justice Stewart stated in a plurality\nopinion joined by Justices Powell ar.d Stevens that in order to\nsatisfy the Eighth Amendment \"the sanction imposed cannot be so\ntotally without penological justification that it results in the\ngratuitous infliction of suffering.\"  Id. at 1S3. Justices Brennan\nand Marshall similarly have approved the penolcgical objectives\nstandard in Furman v. Georgia, 408 D.S. 283  (1972).  See 408 U.S.\nat 279-80 (Brennan, J., concurring);  408 U.S. at 331-33  (Marshall,J.\nconcurring).  This  test  has been applied to a denial of medical\ntreatment in Estelle v. Gar-ble,  425 U.S. at 103, where the Court\nsaid, \"denial of medical care nay result in pain and suffering which\nno one suggests would serve any penological purpose.'\n4-1 T«  Cn-i- at 1384\n\nc\nfive hundred to six hundred feet fro.-?, the main building complex.\nEach cell in the EAU is approximately six feet wide, ter. feet\ndeep, and eight feet high, ar.d is furnished with a bed, mattress,\n& sir-X and hopper corsbination  (controlled by the irjr.ate) , sheets,\nand a pillow.  Only cold water is provided.  The cells are window-\nless and have no interior lighting.  However, there are windows\nacross the corridor fron the cells as well as 150-watt lightbulbs\nin front of the cells which illunir.ate the cells sufficiently  for\ninmates to read.  The cells are clear. a.-.d have no ur.pleasent odors.\nVentilation, is adequate.  —\nInmates confined to the EAU have the same right to\nreceive mail, legal materials, and publications as do these in\ngeneral population.  They receive three showers a week and one hour\nof exercise a day.  A doctor visits the BAU each day and a psychi-\natrist is available at an inziate's request.  Inmates in the BAU\nreceive the sane food as instates in general population, although\noccasionally in reduced portions.\nInmates are co=itted to the EAU by self-ccr^utae.-t,\nas transfers frcn other institutions' BA'J's, or after a due-process\nhearing on charges of ci.scor.duct.  Ccnru.tzie.-its to the 3A~ generally\ndo not exceed thirty days, but there are so—e long-tern assigr.ir.en-s.\n\"Death row\" cells consist of nine cells within the\nBAU.  They are exactly liXe the other BAU cells except that they\nr\nhave hot and cold water.\nWe conclude, based on the record at trial and cur two\nvisits, that use of the BAU at Graterford does net constitute cruel\nand unusual pur.ishz-.er.t  There is no question that the cells in the\nt \nBAU are grin and cheerless.  Nonetheless, we conclude that these\nconditions are rot so ir-h^ane or base that they shock the court's\nconscience, or violate standards of hu---ar. decency.  Similarly, we fi:\n\nr\nr 0\nthat such confinement is rationally related to legitiiMte penal\ngoals end thus meets constitutional standards.\nB.  State Correctional Institution at Dallas.\nThe maximum security cell block at Dallas consists\nof two levels:  the ground level block, known as S-l  and a lower\nr\nlevel, known as the \"Annex\".  S-l comprises eighteen cells;  the\nAnnex contains eleven cells.  »\nThe S-l cells have a separate toilet and sink, a bed,\nand a light inside the cell.  An incite is confined to S-l only\nafter a hearing.  Every seven days the inmate' s conf ineaer.t is\nreviewed by his counselor.  Every thirty days a conaaittee reviews\nthe inmate's confinement with the inmate present.\n. In general, an inmate is sent to the Annex frora S-l.\nConfinement there generally averages from one to four days, although\nin some cases assignment to the Annex has exceeded thirty days.\nThe cells in the Annex measure approximately five feet\nwide by nine feet deep by ten feet high.  They have neither windows\nnor lights, but windows across from the cells and lights in the\ncorridor provide sufficient lighting for inmates to read.  Ver.tilatic:\nis adequate.  The cell block is c+ean and free from unpleasant ocors.\nInmates are generally allowed daily showers and are visited by a dcct:\neach day.  Inmates are generally, but not always, served full rations\nof food.  Daily exercise of up to two hcurs is allowed in the ccrri-\ndor outside the cell except when the innate is disruptive.\nAs with the BAU at Graterford, we must conclude that\nconfinement in the S-l and Annex cells at Dallas, although certainly\nunpleasant, does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\nC.  State Correctisr.21 institution at Muncy.\nThe State Correctional Institution at Kuncy, a women's\nprison, is an open institution,  it has no walls, fences, or perimete:\nguards.  The administrative and punitive segregation units of Mur.cy\n\nL  _~ _\nare housed in Clinton Cottage, which is located in a wooded area\none-half mile fron the main facilities.  Clinton Cottage contains\nforty-eight cells on two floors. The first floor contains ninetee-\ncells, fourteen with single wooden doors used for administrative\nsegregation and fcux with double doors  (one wooden, one barred)\nused for punitive segregation.  The second floor consists of\ntwenty-nine cells, fourteen of which axe double-doored and axe used\nfcr punitive segregation.  The reniair.ir.g second-floor cells are nb\nlonger used.\nEach cell is approximately twelve feet deep by eight\nfeet wide by nine feet high and contains a bed, night table, toilet,\nand sink.  The lighting in the cell consists of a sixty-watt bulb.\nExcept for inmates housed in the first-floor punitive segregation\ncells, inmates in Clinton Cottage axe allowed all items in their\ncell permitted inmates in the general population.  Food.portions\nare not reduced.  Three showers are permitted each week.  Clinton\nCottage is clean tr.d well-ventilated with no unpleasant odors.\nInmates in administrative segregation are allowed out\nof their cells fcr one-half of the day.  However/ those confined\nto punitive segregation are not allowed out at all.  Inmates ir.\npunitive segregation are confined generally fcr from one to two\nweeks, with weekly review, although so-e inmates axe kept for con-\nsiderably longer periods.\nI  We have no difficulty in concluding that conditions at\nj\nClinton Cottage, even for those inmates in punitive segregaticr., do\ni  not constitute cr~uel and unusual punishment.\nD.  State Correctional restitution at Huntingdon.\nThe naxisua security area at Huntingdon contains 144\ncells.  The psychiatric quarters consist of seventeen cells.  Three\nof these cells tre known as the \"Glass Cage\" and provide the focus\nof the  Huntingdon incites' constitutional attack.  v.'e conclude that\n\nuse of the Glass Cage constitutes treatment so inhumane and\ndegrading as to anount to cn;el and unusual punishment,  its\ncontinued use cannot be tolerated.\nThe Glass Cage is enclosed by glass walls and a\nlocked steel door.  The cells measure-approximately nine feet deep\nby eight feet wide by nine feet high.  There is no furniture, no\nvindow, and no inside lighting.  Cells are equipped with a toilet\nand sink and are supposed to include a mattress, two sheets, a\npillow, and blarOcets.  We saw none of these iter.5 during our visits,\nbut the cells were not in use at that tine.  Outside lighting is\ntotally inadequate for reading.  In addition, despite use of a large\nfan, ventilation is insufficient.  The cells are unclean and ar.\nunpleasant odor pervades.\nOur conclusion that the cells in the Glass Cage cannot,\nremain in use is based in large part on our two visits to the\n.Institution.  On each occasion we were genuinely shocked by the\ndark, dirty, and totally isolated conditions we observed.  We agree\nwith plaintiffs that the continued existence of the Glass Cage\nconstitutes a serious threat to the physical and mental well-being\nof every resident who is confined there, and thus .we conclude that\nconfinement in such conditions could serve no legitimate per.ologica.1\npurpose.\nII.  Conjugal Visits.\nPlaintiffs urge us to declare that the lack cf\nfacilities at each institution in which irur.ates may enjoy sexual\nvisitation with' their spouses constitutes cruel and unusual punish-\nment:.  In support of this clais, plaintiffs presented an expert\nwitness. Dr. Herbert Thomas, who testified that lack of conjugal\nvisits is a factor which can cause an inmate to suffer physical,\nemotional, and psychological stress.  The psychological regression\nr\nr.  _\n\nwhich may result can lead to homosexual behavior, violer.ee, less\nof self- identity, and self-destructive behavior.\nPlaintiffs concede that there is no inherent con-\nstitutional right to engage in heterosexual relations in priscn.\nHowever, they argue that the Eighth Amendment protects them frci\nthe deleterious effects which flow from denial of sexual visitation\nrights.  They distinguish cases which have held that denial cf  ,\nconjugal visits dees not constitute cruel and unusual punishment,\nsee, e.g., McCray v. Sullivan, 50S F.2d 1332, 1334  (5th Cir.),\ncert, denied, 423 D.S. 8S9  (1975);  Lycr.s v. Cillicar.,382 F. Sup?.\n198, 201-03 (N.D. Ohio 1974), by noting that the records in those\ncases lacked the expert testimony provided by plaintiffs.\nWe do not believe that Dr. Thomas' testimony justifies\na departure from those decisions upholding the denial of sexual\nvisitation against constitutional attack.  See United States ex rel.\nWolfish v. Levi, 439 F. Supp. 114, 142-43  (S.D.N.Y. 1977), aff'd,\nF.2d  (1978) (and cases cited therein).  Dr. Thomas testified\nthat psychological regression in instates results from many factors.\nForemost among these causes, according to Dr. Thomas, is not denial\nof sexual visitation, but instead, lengthy sentences resulting in\nlong terms of incarceration.  Consequently, we fir.d that the denial\nof sexual visitation itself dees not cause severe mental or physical\ndeterioration.\nIt is clear that not all conditions of confinement vhicr\nhave an adverse effect on a prisoner are constitutionally  proscribed.\nIn Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. at 822-23, the Court stated that one\nof the essential functions of incarceration is the, isolation of -the\nInmate from society, which is intended to be an undesirable ccr.litior\nso as to deter potential criminals frorr. commit ing crir.es.\n\nThe restriction challenged here and its effects on\ninnates do not violate'any of the three Eighth Amendment criteria.\nSee Part I, supra.  It is obvious that the first two tests of\nunconstituticnality have not been met.  The essence of penal .\nconfinement is isolation fron society, including limitations on\nphysical and social interactions.  We conclude that the prohibition\non sexual visitation is not so inhuman that it shocks the conscience\nt\nend that it is not disproportionate punishment.  A closer.question\nis whether such a restriction is rationally related to a legitimate\npenological goal.  We agree with Judge Frar.kel's opinion in Pr.ited\nStates ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi, 439 F. Supp. at 143, that there is\na division of penological opinion on the advisability of conjugal\nvisitation and that the judiciary is ill-equipped to resolve this\ncomplex policy question.  However  since there is ample support for\n r\nthe proposition that a restriction on sexual visitation is rationally\nrelated to legitimate penal concerns for institutional security\nand the deterrence value of incarceration, I conclude that such a\nprohibition must be sustained under the Eighth Amendment.\nJOSEPH, S.

Class counsel has concluded that other claims made by \npro se movants are not subjects of the Consent Decree, \n Footnotes \n \n1  Muhammad K. El–Amin and Carlton Estes, two inmates at State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh, were granted permission to \nbe treated as additional movants with respect to the Motion to Intervene (Document No. 711) by separate Order dated June 25, \n \n1997. \n \n2  The original of this document shall be filed. \n \n \n3  The original of this document shall be filed. \n \n \n4  For example, movant alleges the illegality and/or unconstitutionality of: 1) the exhaustion requirement of the Consent Decree; 2) \n  3 \n \n\nImprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1997)   \n \n  the requirement that an allegation raised in a motion for contempt of the Consent Decree address an institution or system wide \nviolation of the Consent Decree; 3) the use of administrative directives to change Department of Corrections policies that affect \ninmates; and, 4) the Court’s ruling that other lawsuits may be filed by inmates who are members of the plaintiff class if they \nbelieve that their individual constitutional rights have been violated. None of these arguments has merit, and, assuming arguendo \nclass counsel had notice of them, he was therefore correct in choosing not to raise them before this Court. \nFirst, the Court notes that the basis for the exhaustion and system/institution wide violation requirements of the Consent Decree \nare set forth in this Court’s Memorandum dated December 9, 1996. See Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, No. Civ. A. \n70–3054, 1996 WL 735489, *5–7 (E.D.Pa. Dec.9, 1996). Movant’s arguments do not provide meritorious bases for challenging \nthose requirements. \nSecond, with respect to movant’s concern with the alleged “illegality” of various administrative directives promulgated by the \nDepartment of Corrections, the Consent Decree provides as follows: “Defendant Commissioner of Correction[s] reserves the \nright to amend, suspend, alter or modify any of the Administrative Directives and the additions and amendments thereto as \nprovided in this Decree, and plaintiffs reserve their right to contest in this Court any such amendment, suspension, alteration or \nmodification of the provisions of this Consent Decree.” Consent Decree, § XIX. Class counsel carefully monitors all \nadministrative directives and “it is his position ... that newly enacted administrative directives which do not explicitly run \ncounter to rights enumerated in the Consent Decree can not be the subject of contempt citation.” Class Counsel’s Response to \nPro Se Motion for Contempt Filed By Class Members Smith, Yount, Boone, Romberger, Kopac and Teater, at 2 (Document No. \n720, filed June 9, 1997). The Court agrees with class counsel’s position and notes that throughout his “Response to Pro Se \nMotion for Contempt” he explicitly states which challenges to current administrative directives he believes run afoul of the \nConsent Decree and which do not. \nFinally, there is no merit in movant’s challenge to the Court’s prior ruling that individuals who are not entitled to relief under the \nConsent Decree but believe that their individual constitutional rights have been violated may file a lawsuit in a Court with \njurisdiction and where venue is properly laid. Movant fails to recognize that the subject matter of the Consent Decree is limited \nin such a manner that inmates within the plaintiff class may file lawsuits claiming violations of their constitutional rights as \nindividuals. Such suits are permissible because the Consent Decree only addresses institution and system wide violations of its \nterms—not individual violations, nor unrelated violations of an inmate’s individual constitutional rights. See Imprisoned Citizens \nUnion, 1996 WL 735489, at *5–6 (concluding that Section XXIII of the Consent Decree does not create an individual cause of \naction under the Decree and requires that motions for contempt of the Decree be based upon system and/or institution wide \nviolations of the Decree). Thus, lawsuits based upon the violation of individual inmate’s constitutional rights are not preempted \nby the Consent Decree. See Moore v. Lehman, 940 F.Supp. 704, 708 (M.D.Pa.1996). \n \n5  The Court was recently notified that defense counsel has provided class counsel with some of the documents and other information \ncovered by the Motion to Compel and that discussions are continuing with respect to production of additional documents and \n \ninformation. At the joint request of counsel the Court ordered that the Motion to Compel be held in abeyance. Imprisoned Citizens \nUnion v. Shapp, Civ.A.No. 70–3054 (E.D.Pa. June 24, 1997) (order holding Motion to Compel Discovery Regarding Defendants’ \nConsent Decree and Compliance in abeyance). The current procedural status of the Motion supports the Court’s conclusion that \nclass counsel has more than adequately represented movant’s interests. \n \n6  That response is entitled Class Counsel’s Response to Pro Se Motion for Contempt Filed By Class Members Smith, Yount, Boone, \nRomberger, Kopac and Teater (“Response to Pro Se Motion for Contempt”) (Document No. 720, filed June 9, 1997). The title of \n \nthe response is in error because the Motion for Contempt was not filed. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  4 \n ",

The  actions\noriginally purported  to be on behalf of all state prisoners  in\nPennsylvania  and were directed  at various facets of  all  state\nprisons  in Pennsylvania.  The actions were concluded by a Con-\nsent Decree which was executed on May 22, 1978.\nSince that time, there has been a more or less constant\nstream of complaints  from prisoners of violations  of  the Con-\nsent  Decree.  Some  of  these  were  purely  alleged  individual\ncivil  rights  violations  and  were not  covered  by  the  terms  of\nthe Consent Decree.  Others may well have been either  institu-\ntion-wide or state-wide and therefore  in violation of the Con-\nsent Decree's state-wide  reach.  Some of  these  alleged  viola-\ntions have been accompanied  by motions for conterr.pt.

Hall, Jr. undertook\nto cooperate with  counsel  for  the  plaintiffs  and  counsel  for\nthe  Attorney  General  of  Pennsylvania  to  settle  all  of  these\ndifferences  once  and  for  all.  After  protracted  negotiations\nand discussions  the parties have  finally  arrived  at  a settle-\n• ment  which  disposes  of  all  of  the  outstanding  complaints.

We affirm.\nI.\nA. The Consent Decree\nIn 1970, inmates at Pennsylvania's seven state prisons (\"the Inmates\") brought a class action lawsuit against\nvarious state officials pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Inmates alleged unconstitutional conditions of\nconfinement. In 1978, the District Court approved a consent decree settling most of the issues raised in the\nlawsuit. The District Court retained jurisdiction, and subsequently approved several amendments to the decree.\nAs amended, the decree governs nearly every aspect of prison management. Among other things, the decree (1)\n182 specifies the type *182 of misconduct for which prisoners can be punished; (2) limits the punishment that can be\nimposed for specific acts of misconduct; (3) restricts prison officials' handling of prisoner mail; (4) guarantees\n[1]\nprisoner access to outside publications; (5) establishes health care and sanitation standards;  (6) imposes\n[2] [3]\nrestrictive standards for prison officials' use of force,  restraints, and mace;  (7) prescribes detailed\n[4]\nprocedures for conducting cell searches;  (8) gives prisoners the right to possess civilian clothing; and (9)\nrequires the prisons to provide free postage to prisoners. The Defendants contend that the decree has imposed\nsubstantial administrative burdens on the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, and that as a result of the\ndecree prison officials have faced burdensome legal battles, having to defend many of their day-to-day\nmanagement decisions in federal court.\nB. The Termination Provision\nResponding to concerns that similar consent decrees were crippling prison systems throughout the country,\nCongress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) in 1996. One provision of the PLRA authorizes\ndefendants in prison condition lawsuits to obtain\nimmediate termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the\nabsence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than\nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary\nto correct the violation of the Federal right.\n18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2) (\"the termination provision\"). The supervising court may refuse to terminate jurisdiction\nonly if it makes written findings \"that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing\nviolation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and\n\nthat the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\" Id. § 3626(b)\n(3).\nC. The Termination Order\nRelying on § 3626(b)(2), Defendants filed a motion to terminate the 1978 consent decree on September 23,\n1997. The Inmates argued that the motion was inappropriate and asked the court to hold Defendants in\ncontempt. The Inmates also maintained that the PLRA's termination provision was unconstitutional.\nThe United States filed a motion to intervene pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403, seeking the opportunity to defend the\nconstitutionality of the PLRA's termination provision. The District Court granted that motion.\nThe District Court subsequently issued an opinion and order granting the Defendants' motion to terminate the\nconsent decree, and denying the Inmates' motion that the Defendants be held in contempt. Imprisoned Citizens\nUnion v. Shapp, 11 F.Supp.2d 586 (E.D.Pa.1998). The Inmates promptly filed a motion for reconsideration. The\n183 District *183 Court denied that motion. The Inmates then filed the present appeal.\nII.\nAppellants raise four issues on appeal: (1) whether the PLRA's termination provision violates the constitutional\nseparation-of-powers doctrine, as applied to consent decrees entered before the PLRA's enactment; (2) whether\nthe termination provision violates the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; (3)\nwhether the District Court abused its discretion by refusing to stay Defendants' motion to terminate; and (4)\n[5]\nwhether the District Court abused its discretion by refusing to hold Defendants in contempt of court.  We will\naddress each issue in turn.\nA. Separation-of-Powers\nThe Inmates argue that the PLRA's termination provision violates the separation-of-powers doctrine in three\nrespects. First, they argue that the provision requires courts to reopen final judgments in violation of the well-\nestablished rule that Congress may not interfere with the final judgments of Article III courts. See Plaut v.\nSpendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 218, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995). Second, they claim that the\ntermination provision \"mandate[s] the result in a particular case.\" United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128,\n146-47, 20 L.Ed. 519 (1871). Third, they maintain that the provision strips the courts of their inherent power to\nenforce effective remedies in constitutional cases.\nWe note at the outset that six other circuits have upheld the PLRA against a separation-of-powers challenge. See\nHadix v. Johnson, 133 F.3d 940, 943 (6th Cir.),cert. denied___ U.S. ___, 118 S.Ct. 2368, 141 L.Ed.2d 737\n(1998); Dougan v. Singletary, 129 F.3d 1424, 1426-27 (11th Cir.1997); Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse,\n129 F.3d 649, 656-57 (1st Cir.1997); Benjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d 162, 173 (2d Cir.1997); Gavin v. Branstad,\n122 F.3d 1081, 1087 (8th Cir.1997)reh'g granted (Dec. 23, 1997); Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365, 371 (4th\nCir.1996). Only the Ninth Circuit has concluded otherwise. Taylor v. United States, 143 F.3d 1178, 1184 (9th\nCir.1998)reh'g granted (Nov. 3, 1998).\n1. Reopening a Final Judgment\nThe Inmates contend that § 3626(b)(2) impermissibly reopens a final judgment. Relying on the Supreme Court's\nopinion in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995), they argue that\nthe provision violates the separation-of-powers doctrine by allowing Congress to \"set aside . . . final judgment[s].\"\nId. at 240, 115 S.Ct. 1447.\nIn Plaut, the Court declared unconstitutional a federal statute that required courts to reopen certain securities\nfraud cases that had been dismissed on statute-of-limitations grounds. Plaut, 514 U.S. at 214-15, 115 S.Ct. 1447.\n\nThe Court concluded that the statute violated the separation-of-powers doctrine by interfering with the \"judicial\nPower . . . to render dispositive judgments.\" Id. at 219, 115 S.Ct. 1447. The Court explained that the separation-\nof-powers doctrine generally forbids Congress from reversing final judgments in a suit for money damages. Id. At\nthe same time, however, the Court noted that this rule does not apply to legislation that merely \"alter[s] the\nprospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts.\" Id. at 232, 115 S.Ct. 1447.\nThis exception for legislation that alters the prospective effects of injunctions is not new: \"its roots burrow deep\ninto our constitutional soil.\" Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 656 (1st Cir. 1997). It can be\ntraced to Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 421, 15 L.Ed. 435 (1855), where\nthe Supreme Court held that Congress has the power to alter prospective judgments in equity.\n184 *184Wheeling Bridge arose out of an earlier case in which the Supreme Court found that a particular bridge\nunreasonably interfered with navigable waters, and ordered that the bridge be removed or elevated. See 54 U.S.\n(13 How.) 518, 626, 14 L.Ed. 249. After the first decision, Congress passed a statute declaring the bridge to be a\nlawful structure, establishing it as a post road, and requiring vessels using the river to avoid interfering with the\nbridge. The parties subsequently returned to the Court when the bridge company sought to rebuild the bridge\nafter a storm had destroyed the original structure. Recognizing the impact of the intervening congressional action,\nthe Court dissolved its injunction.\nIn rejecting the plaintiff's argument that Congress' action was an unconstitutional attempt to override the Court's\nearlier decision, the Court explained that while Congress cannot alter a judgment at law, it can alter the\nprospective elements of a judgment in equity by changing the underlying rule of law. Id. at 431-32. The Court\nreasoned that\nif the remedy in this case had been an action at law, and a judgment rendered in favor of the\nplaintiff were for damages, the right to these would have passed beyond the reach of the power of\ncongress. It would have depended, not upon the public right of the free navigation of the river, but\nupon the judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as it respect[s] the costs adjudged,\nstands upon the same principles, and is unaffected by the subsequent law. But that part of the\ndecree, directing the abatement of the obstruction, is executory, a continuing decree, which\nrequires not only the removal of the bridge, but enjoins defendants against any reconstruction or\ncontinuance. Now, whether it is a future existing or continuing obstruction depends upon the\nquestion whether or not it interferes with the right of navigation. If, in the mean time, since the\ndecree, this right has been modified by the competent authority, so that the bridge is no longer an\nunlawful obstruction, it is quite plain the decree of the court cannot be enforced.\nId. at 431-32. Wheeling Bridge therefore stands for the proposition that when Congress changes the law\nunderlying a judgment awarding prospective injunctive relief, the judgment becomes void to the extent that it is\ninconsistent with the amended law.\nThe Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed the validity of this principle, and has even recognized its\napplication to consent decrees. For example, in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct.\n748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), the Court explained that a consent decree may be modified when \"one or more of\nthe obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal law\" or when \"the statutory or\ndecisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.\" Id. at 388, 112 S.Ct. 748.\nSimilarly, in System Fed'n No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 81 S.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961), the Court noted\nthat\nthe District Court's authority to adopt a consent decree comes only from the statute which the\ndecree is intended to enforce. Frequently of course the terms arrived at by the parties are\naccepted without change by the adopting court. But just as the adopting court is free to reject\nagreed-upon terms as not in furtherance of statutory objectives, so must it be free to modify the\nterms of a consent decree when a change in law brings those terms in conflict with statutory\nobjectives. . . . The parties have no power to require of the court continuing enforcement of rights\nthe statute no longer gives.\n\nId. at 651-52, 81 S.Ct. 368.\nThus, unlike the judgments at issue in Plaut, the consent decree here is not impervious to legislative modification.\nAs a judgment awarding prospective injunctive relief00much like the judgment at issue in Wheeling Bridge00the\n97 97\nInmates' consent decree is necessarily altered every time \"a change in law brings [the decree's] terms in conflict\nwith statutory objectives.\" System Fed'n No. 91, 364 U.S. at 651, 81 S.Ct. 368.\nSuch a change has occurred here. In enacting the PLRA, Congress exercised its Article I authority to prescribe\n185 rules for courts *185 to apply when issuing or perpetuating prospective relief. Those rules do not transgress the\nseparation-of-powers doctrine. If anything, a judicial determination that Congress lacked authority to limit the\nprospective application of injunctive orders would present a more serious separation-of-powers problem. As the\nFirst Circuit recently stated,\nIf forward-looking judgments in equity were inviolate, then one of two scenarios would develop:\neither the legislature would be stripped of the ability to change substantive law once an injunction\nhad been issued pursuant to that law, or an issued injunction would continue to have force after\nthe law that originally gave the injunction legitimacy had been found wanting (and hence, altered).\nThe first of these possible results would work an undue judicial interference with the legislative\nprocess, while the second would create an intolerable tangle in which some laws applied to some\npersons and not to others. Since the separation of powers principle is a two-way street, courts\nmust be careful not to embrace a legal regime that promotes such awkward scenarios.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 656-57 (1st Cir.1997).\nA determination that Congress is powerless to alter the courts' authority to award prospective injunctive relief\nwould be especially unwarranted here, since the Supreme Court has commented on the importance of getting the\ncourts out of the prison management business:\n[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison management. . . .\n[T]he problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are\nnot readily susceptible of resolution by decree. Running a prison is an inordinately difficult\nundertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are\npeculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government. Prison\nadministration is, moreover, a task that has been committed to the responsibility of those\nbranches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint. Where a state\npenal system is involved, federal courts have . . . additional reason to accord deference to the\nappropriate prison authorities.\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-85, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (internal citations and quotation\nmarks omitted). Thus, our decision today is not merely consistent with separation-of-powers principles; it furthers\nthose principles.\nNevertheless, the Inmates maintain that the Wheeling Bridge exception does not apply here because the law\nunderlying the consent decree00which they claim to be the Eighth Amendment00was not amended by the PLRA. In\n97 97\nraising this argument, they rely heavily on the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Taylor v. United States, 143 F.3d 1178\n(9th Cir.1998),reh'g granted (Nov. 3, 1998). The Ninth Circuit reasoned that \"[e]ven though the district court here\n. . . was never called upon to decide the factual and legal issues underlying the [inmates'] constitutional claims, it\nis clear that such claims were resolved by the consent decree, and the Constitution remains the law underpinning\nthe dispute.\" Applying this reasoning, the Taylor panel concluded that the PLRA \"clearly did not\" \"change[ ] the\nsubstantive law upon which the parties' consent decree . . . was based.\" Id. at 1183.\nWe disagree with the Ninth Circuit's reasoning, and we reject the Inmates' argument. The law underlying the\nconsent decree is not the Eighth Amendment; it is the courts' statutory authority to issue prospective injunctive\nrelief in the absence of an ongoing violation of a federal right. This authority existed when the consent decree\nwas entered, but was withdrawn with the enactment of the PLRA. Accord, Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v.\nRouse, 129 F.3d 649, 657 (1st Cir.1997) (\"The relevant underlying law in this case is not the Eighth Amendment,\n\nas there has been no finding of an ongoing constitutional violation.\"); Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365, 372 (4th\nCir.1996) (\"The Inmates fail to understand that the applicable law is not the Eighth Amendment, but rather is the\n186 authority of the district court to award *186 relief greater than that required by federal law.\").\nThis would be a very different case if we were convinced00as the Taylor panel obviously was00that the PLRA\n97 97\ncategorically terminates all relief available to \"prisoners who claim constitutional violations.\" Taylor, 143 F.3d at\n1183. But the PLRA expressly preserves the courts' authority to remedy violations of prisoners' federal rights. \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3); see also infra, Section II.A.3. The Inmates therefore cannot maintain that the PLRA\ncurtailed their Eighth Amendment rights. Accordingly, we reject the argument that the PLRA goes beyond\namending the law underlying the consent decree.\nThe Inmates also contend that the Wheeling Bridge exception applies only in cases involving \"public\" rights. They\nclaim that because the consent decree was intended to protect the \"private\" rights of individual prisoners,\nCongress is powerless to amend it. This argument appears to be based on the following language from Wheeling\nBridge:\n[I]t is urged, that the act of congress cannot have the effect and operation to annul the judgment of\nthe court already rendered, or the rights determined thereby in favor of the plaintiff. This, as a\ngeneral proposition, is certainly not to be denied, especially as it respects adjudication upon the \nprivate rights of parties. When they have passed into judgment the right becomes absolute, and it\nis the duty of the court to enforce it.\nThe case before us, however, is distinguishable from this class of cases, so far as it respects that\nportion of the decree directing the abatement of the bridge. Its interference with the free navigation\nof the river constituted an obstruction of a public right secured by acts of congress.\nWheeling Bridge, 59 U.S. at 431 (emphasis added). At first glance, this reading appears to support the Inmates'\nargument.\nHowever, a more careful analysis shows that the Court's holding in Wheeling Bridge did not hinge on the\ndistinction between public and private rights. Instead, it focused on the difference between prospective injunctive\nrelief and judgments for damages. As the Wheeling Bridge Court explained,\nif the remedy in this case had been an action at law, and a judgment rendered in favor of the\nplaintiff for damages, the right to these would have passed beyond the reach of the power of\ncongress. It would have depended, not upon the public right of the free navigation of the river, but\nupon the judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as it respects the costs adjudged,\nstands upon the same principles, and is unaffected by the subsequent law. But that part of the\ndecree, directing the abatement of the obstruction, is executory, a continuing decree, which\nrequires not only the removal of the bridge, but enjoins the defendants against any reconstruction\nor continuance.\nWheeling Bridge, 59 U.S. at 431. Thus, the Wheeling Bridge Court's decision ultimately turned on the nature of\nthe relief, not the source of the right. As the District Court concluded, it is this distinction that \"ultimately\ndetermines the right of Congress to change the law in such a way that relief must be altered or modified.\" \nImprisoned Citizens, 11 F.Supp.2d at 598. Cf. Plaut, 514 U.S. at 232, 115 S.Ct. 1447 (noting that the statute at\nissue in Wheeling Bridge \"altered the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts\" and that\n\"nothing in our holding today calls [Wheeling Bridge] . . . into question.\"); Polites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426,\n438, 81 S.Ct. 202, 5 L.Ed.2d 173 (1960)(Brennan, J., dissenting) (citing Wheeling Bridge for the proposition that\n\"it was the law long before the promulgation of Rule 60(b) that a change in the law after the rendition of a decree\nwas grounds for modification or dissolution of that decree insofar as it might affect future conduct.\"). We therefore\nreject the Inmates' \"public rights\" argument. Accord, Gavin v. Branstad, 122 F.3d 1081, 1088 (8th Cir.1997) (\"The\ncharacter of the right involved has nothing to do with the separation-of-powers issue that we have in this case.\").\n\nOur holding today would be no different if we were to decide that the Wheeling Bridge exception only applies\n187 where public rights are at stake. To whatever extent the *187 consent decree embodies private rights, those\n[6]\nrights are unaffected by the PLRA.  As the Second Circuit recently explained,\n[E]ven assuming that we were to adopt the requirement that00under separation of powers\n97\nprinciples00executory judgments must concern a public right in order to be susceptible to\n97\nlegislative revision, that would still not render the termination provision unconstitutional. . . . This is\nbecause the . . . right in question in this case relates not to the private rights of the detainees . . .\nbut to the right to have non-federal claims vindicated in a federal forum. . . . Thus, even if we\naccept the plaintiffs' graft of a \"public right\" requirement as limiting the circumstances in which an\nexecutory judgment can be legislatively altered, the termination provision survives.\nBenjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d 162, 172 (2d Cir.1997),reh'g granted Dec. 23, 1997. Therefore, even if the\nInmates' \"public rights\" reading of Wheeling Bridge had some validity, it would not affect our decision.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the PLRA does not impermissibly mandate the reopening of final judgments.\n2. Prescribing a Rule of Decision\nRelying on United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 20 L.Ed. 519 (1871), the Inmates also contend that the\ntermination provision violates the separation-of-powers doctrine by prescribing the rule of decision in a pending\ncase. In Klein, the Court held unconstitutional a federal statute enacted after the Civil War that was designed to\nprevent pardoned ex-Confederates from reclaiming seized property. The act proclaimed that a presidential\npardon constituted conclusive evidence that the pardoned individual had been disloyal to the United States. Id. at\n143-44. It also provided that a pardon could not be used as evidence of loyalty in a suit to recover confiscated\nproperty from the United States, and directed the Court to dismiss all recovery cases pending on appeal in which\na pardoned individual had prevailed. Id. The Court found that in enacting the statute, Congress was attempting to\nprescribe the rule of decision for pending cases in violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine. Id. at 147.\nWhile the Supreme Court has never determined \"the precise scope of Klein,\" Plaut, 514 U.S. at 218, 115 S.Ct.\n1447, \"later decisions have made clear that its prohibition does not take hold when\" Congress merely \"amend[s]\napplicable law.\" Id. (quoting Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc'y, 503 U.S. 429, 441, 112 S.Ct. 1407, 118 L.Ed.2d\n73 (1992)). Thus, if a statute \"compel[s] changes in the law, not findings or results under old law,\" it merely\namends the underlying law, and is therefore not subject to a Klein challenge. Robertson, 503 U.S. at 438, 112\nS.Ct. 1407.\nRelying heavily on the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Taylor, the Inmates argue that the PLRA \"direct[s] the outcome of\nthis case and similarly situated pre-PLRA consent decrees.\" Taylor, 143 F.3d at 1184. We disagree.\nWhile § 3626(b)(2) requires a district court to terminate prospective relief approved in the absence of a finding\nthat the relief is no greater than necessary to correct ongoing violations of federal rights, it does not \"direct the\noutcome of this case and similarly situated pre-PLRA consent decrees.\" Taylor, 143 F.3d at 1184. Section 3626\n(b)(2) provides only the standard the district courts must apply, not a rule of decision. It can therefore be said that\nthe PLRA \"has left the judicial functions of interpreting the law and applying the law to the facts entirely in the\nhands of the courts.\" Gavin v. Branstad, 122 F.3d 1081, 1089 (8th Cir.1997). Accord Hadix, 133 F.3d at 943 (\"The\ninterpretation and application of law to fact and the ultimate resolution of prison condition cases remain at all\n188 times with the judiciary.\"); Inmates of Suffolk County, 129 F.3d at 657-58; *188 (\"[T]he relevant underlying law for\npresent purposes is not the Eighth Amendment, but the power of the federal courts to grant prospective relief\nabsent a violation of a federal right. Thus, the PLRA does not run afoul of Klein because it does not tamper with\ncourts' decisional rules00that is, courts remain free to interpret and apply the law to the facts as they discern\n97\nthem.\"); Benjamin, 124 F.3d at 174 (\"[U]nlike the Klein statute, the termination provision does not prevent courts\nfrom exercising jurisdiction over those cases that involve violations of . . . federal rights.\"); Plyler, 100 F.3d at 372\n(\"In short, § 3626(b)(2) provides only the standard to which district courts must adhere, not the result they must\nreach.\").\n\nWe conclude that because § 3626(b)(2) \"compel[s] changes in the law, not findings or results under old law,\" it is\nnot subject to a Klein challenge. Robertson, 503 U.S. at 438, 112 S.Ct. 1407.\n3. Authority to Enforce Effective Remedies\nThe Inmates also argue that the termination provision strips the courts of their inherent power to enforce effective\nremedies in constitutional cases. We reject this argument. Under the PLRA, courts retain their authority to\nadjudicate constitutional challenges and grant equitable relief to remedy constitutional violations. The PLRA\nsimply requires that such relief be \"narrowly drawn,\" extend \"no further than necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right,\" and be \"the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" 18\nU.S.C. §§ 3626(a)(1)(A), (b)(2), and (b)(3).\nThese standards are consistent with well-established limitations on the courts' authority to issue prospective\ninjunctive relief to remedy constitutional violations. In constitutional cases, \"the nature of the violation determines\nthe scope of the remedy.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg B'd of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28\nL.Ed.2d 554 (1971). Likewise, the remedy imposed must be tailored00temporally as well as substantively00to\n97 97\nredress the constitutional wrong at issue. See e.g., Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135\nL.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (\"The remedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury-in-fact\nthat the plaintiff has established.\"); Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237,\n248, 111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991) (\"[N]ecessary concern for the important values of local control . . .\ndictates that a federal court's regulatory control . . . not extend beyond the time required to remedy the effects of\npast [constitutional violations].\"). In this sense, the PLRA amounts to little more than a codification of already-\nexisting rules governing judicial interference with prisons.\nWe disagree with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the PLRA \"leaves no room for judicial decision-making.\" \nTaylor, 143 F.3d at 1184. The statute expressly authorizes the courts to \"continue to define the scope of\nprisoners' constitutional rights, review the factual record, apply the judicially determined constitutional standards\nto the facts as they are found in the record and determine what relief is necessary to remedy the constitutional\nviolations.\" Tyler v. Murphy, 135 F.3d 594, 597 (8th Cir.1998). As a result, the courts will still be capable of\n\"remedy[ing] violations of prisoners' constitutional rights as they have traditionally done in litigated cases.\" \nBenjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d 162, 170 (2d Cir.1997)reh'g granted (Dec. 23, 1997). Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the PLRA's effect on the courts' authority to remedy constitutional violations does not violate the separation-\nof-powers doctrine.\nB. Equal Protection\nThe Inmates also argue that § 3626(b)(2) deprives them of their right to equal protection of the laws. They\ncontend that, as a whole, the PLRA burdens their fundamental right of access to the courts, and therefore must\nbe analyzed under strict scrutiny.\n1. Strict Scrutiny\nThe termination provision does not deny prisoners \"a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed\n189 violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.\" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 351, *189 116 S.Ct.\n2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (quoting Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 825, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977)\n). Rather, it merely restricts the relief that prisoners may obtain from the courts. See Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d\n365, 373 (4th Cir.1996). The provision therefore does not infringe any identified fundamental right, and is subject\nto only rational basis review. See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631-32, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855\n(1996).\n\n2. Rational Basis Scrutiny\nThe Inmates argue that even if § 3626(b)(2) is not subject to strict scrutiny, it still fails under rational basis review.\nSpecifically, they claim that the provision discriminates against prisoners, and is not rationally related to a\nlegitimate governmental interest. We are not persuaded.\nWhile § 3626(b)(2) admittedly singles out certain prisoner rights cases for special treatment, it does so only to\nadvance unquestionably legitimate purposes00to minimize prison micro-management by federal courts and to\n97\nconserve judicial resources. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at 349, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (\"[I]t is not the role of courts, but that of\nthe political branches, to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the\nConstitution.\"); see also City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 440-41, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87\nL.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (explaining that a statute subject to rational basis review will survive an equal protection\nchallenge \"if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\"). The\ntermination provision therefore satisfies the demands of equal protection.\nC. The District Court's Denial of the Inmates' Motion to Stay\nThe Inmates also argue that the District Court abused its discretion by refusing to stay the termination order until\nsuch time as \"the courts of Pennsylvania agree to enforce the [consent decree].\" Brief for Appellants at 46. In\nmaking this argument, the Inmates rely heavily on the Second Circuit's novel theory that (a) consent decrees\nembody \"contracts arising under state law\" and (b) federal courts therefore cannot terminate a consent decree\nunder § 3626(b)(2) without first securing parties' contractual rights under that decree. See Benjamin v. Jacobson,\n124 F.3d 162, 178-79 (2d Cir.1997),reh'g granted (Dec. 23, 1997).\n1. Clear Statutory Mandate\nWe cannot accept this argument without ignoring the plain language of the PLRA. The statute entitles defendants\nto \"immediate termination of any prospective relief\" absent a finding of a current and ongoing violation of federal\nlaw. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2), (b)(3). It also broadly defines \"prospective relief\" as including \"all relief other\n[7]\nthan compensatory monetary damages,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(7).  Because the 1978 consent decree\nunquestionably fits within that definition, and because the district court made no findings of a current and ongoing\nviolation of federal law, the law demands nothing less than the immediate termination of the consent decree. The\nInmates cite no principle of law that allows us to disregard this unambiguous statutory mandate in order to\npreserve the consent decree. In effect, the Inmates have asked us to turn the termination provision on its head,\nand replace § 3626(b) with language prohibiting termination of consent decrees unless or until a state court\n\"agrees to enforce\" them. We decline their invitation to do so.\n2. No Current Unconstitutional Impairment\nWe also reject the Inmates' claim that since they \"might\" have contractual rights in the consent decrees under\nPennsylvania law, and Defendants \"might\" refuse to enforce such rights, the District Court must maintain\n190 jurisdiction over the decrees in order to prevent Defendants from unconstitutionally *190 impairing their own\ncontractual obligations. Brief for Appellants at 45 (quoting Benjamin, 124 F.3d at 179). Mere speculation that\nDefendants might refuse to honor alleged contractual obligations is insufficient to support a finding of \"current and\nongoing violations of [a] Federal right.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3). The District Court therefore had no statutory basis\nfor maintaining jurisdiction over the consent decrees.\nIf the Inmates have valid contractual claims that survive termination, such claims are \"based solely upon . . .\n[Pennsylvania] law,\" and are not affected by the PLRA. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(d) (\"The limitations on remedies in this\nsection shall not apply to relief entered by a State court based solely upon claims arising under State law.\"). The\nInmates are therefore free to pursue relief in the Pennsylvania courts. It is not our province to speak to the validity\n\nof any \"claims arising under [Pennsylvania] law,\" or to award relief therefor. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(d). It is our\nprovince, however, to decide whether there is any basis for the Inmates' argument that the District Court should\nhave stayed its termination order until such time as \"the courts of Pennsylvania agree to enforce the [consent\ndecree].\" Brief for Appellants at 46. There is not. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court's denial of the\nInmates motion to stay did not amount to an abuse of discretion.\nD. Defendants' Past Non-Compliance\nFinally, the Inmates argue that the District Court abused its discretion by refusing to hold Defendants in contempt\nfor failing to comply with portions of the consent decree in the past. More to the point, they claim that the District\nCourt should have denied Defendants' motion to terminate as a remedy for contempt.\nAgain, we cannot accept this argument without ignoring the express language of the PLRA. Congress could have\nauthorized the courts to maintain jurisdiction over a consent decree where the defendants have failed to comply\nwith the decree. However, it did not. Instead, Congress chose to allow the courts to maintain jurisdiction only\nwhere defendants are guilty of \"current and ongoing\" violations of a federal right. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).\nMoreover, denying Defendants' motion to terminate would have been an inappropriate remedy for civil contempt\nbecause it would have \"had no coercive effect.\" Harris v. City of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1311, 1328 (3d Cir. 1995)\n(holding that denying a motion to terminate under the PLRA was not a proper remedy for civil contempt related to\nthe city's past non-compliance with a consent decree). We therefore conclude that the District Court's refusal to\ncite Defendants with contempt did not amount to an abuse of discretion.\nIII.\nThe Inmates have not established that the PLRA is unconstitutional, nor have they established that the District\nCourt abused its discretion in any way. Accordingly, we affirm.\n[1] One provision provides that \"[a]t each institution a physician will conduct a monthly inspection of all food\npreparation and food storage space, the institution hospital and infirmary, and all other facilities connected with\nhealth care and health care delivery.\" Joint App. at 253. That physician must \"submit a report of his inspection to\nhis superintendent immediately after his inspection, and these reports shall be maintained at each institution.\" Id.\n[2] The provisions governing the use of force authorize force only where necessary to prevent harm to person or\nproperty or to thwart an escape attempt. Joint App. at 256. In contrast, Pennsylvania law provides that prison\nofficials may use physical force to compel compliance with prison rules. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 509(5).\n[3] Prison officials must consult medical personnel before using mace on any prisoner \"to determine whether that\nresident has any disease or condition that would make the use of Mace particularly dangerous.\" Joint App. at\n261. Once authorized to do so, prison officials may only use mace \"in a short burst of approximately two (2)\nseconds in duration,\" and are required to wait fifteen seconds before firing a second burst.\n[4] Prison officials must give inmates notice before conducting cell searches, and allow them to be present during\nany such searches. Inmates subjected to cell searches must \"be asked to sign a record to show that he was\npresent during the search or . . . that he [chose] not to be present.\" Joint App. at 285.\n[5] At oral argument, the Inmates also argued that the PLRA is unconstitutional because it provides plaintiffs a\nmere 30 days in which to gather evidence necessary to oppose termination under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3). See \nHadix v. Johnson, 144 F.3d 925 (6th Cir.1998). However, because the Inmates neither raised this argument\nbefore the District Court nor discussed it in their briefs on appeal, we do not address it.\n[6] We express no opinion as to whether the Inmates have private rights in the consent decree. See infra, Section\nII.C.2. We simply note that if they do, those rights exist under state law and are not affected by the PLRA. See 18\nU.S.C. § 3626(d) (\"The limitations on remedies in this section shall not apply to relief entered by a State court\nbased solely upon claims arising under State law.\").\n\n[7] The PLRA defines \"relief\" as \"all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court, and includes\nconsent decrees, but does not include private settlement agreements.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(9). It further defines\n\"consent decree\" as \"any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or\nacquiescence of the parties, but does not include private settlements.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(1).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Pennsylvania.\nNovember 20, 1978.\n523 *523 John T. Snavely, II, Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiffs.\nJ. Andrew Smyser, Deputy Atty. Gen., Dept. of Justice, Harrisburg, Pa., for defendants.\nOPINION\nJOSEPH S. LORD, III, Chief Judge.\nIn an order entered May 30, 1978 we enjoined on Eighth Amendment grounds the continued use of three\nmaximum security cells, known as the \"Glass Cage\", at the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon,\nPennsylvania. Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 451 F.Supp. 893, 898 (E.D. Pa.1978). Defendants, alleging\nthat the constitutional defects in the Glass Cage have been cured, moved on June 7 under Rule 59 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure for relief from our judgment. We are thus again asked to consider the mercurial concept\nof cruel and unusual punishment.\nI. THE INJUNCTION:\nIn our June 7 opinion we described the three isolation cells at Huntingdon as follows:\n\"The Glass Cage is enclosed by glass walls and a locked steel door. The cells measure\napproximately 9' deep by 8' wide by 9' high. There is no furniture, no window, and no inside\nlighting. Cells are equipped with a toilet and sink and are supposed to include a mattress, two\nsheets, a pillow, and blankets. We saw none of these items during our visits, but the cells were not\nin use at that time. Outside lighting is totally inadequate for reading. In addition, despite use of a\nlarge fan, ventilation is insufficient. The cells are unclean and an unpleasant odor pervades.\" 451\nF.Supp. at 898.\nThese observations were made during tours of the maximum security area taken in August 1974 and one year\nlater in August 1975. The injunction against continued use of the three psychiatric cells was anchored in our\nvisceral impressions:\n\"Our conclusion that the cells in the Glass Cage cannot remain in use is based in large part on our\ntwo visits to the institution. On each occasion we were genuinely shocked by the dark, dirty, and\ntotally isolated conditions we observed. We agree with plaintiffs that the continued existence of the\nGlass Cage constitutes a serious threat to the physical and mental well-being of every resident\nwho is confined there, and thus we conclude that confinement in such conditions could serve no\nlegitimate penological purpose.\" Id.\nDefendants now argue that because of improvements in the Glass Cage since our last visit over three years ago,\nconditions are no longer shocking and use of the cells no longer illegitimate.\n\nII. DEFENDANTS' MOTION: Rule 59(a) or 60(b)?\nDefendants have styled their request that the injunction be lifted as a motion for \"new trial or amendment of\n524 judgment under Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil *524 Procedure.\"[1] We doubt that a 59(a)(2) motion is the\nproper procedural vehicle for bringing defendants' argument before us. Professor Moore, discussing Rule 59(a)\n(2), writes that \"[a]s a practical matter, in equity formerly and in court actions now, three grounds for new trial are\nmost commonly known: for manifest error of law or fact, and for newly discovered evidence.\" 6A Moore's Federal\nPractice, ¶ 59.07 at 59-940059-95 (2d ed. 1974) (footnotes omitted). Neither manifest error of fact nor of law has\n97\nbeen or can be urged by defendants. The \"newly discovered evidence\" ground is likewise untenable here. \"To\nconstitute newly discovered evidence for which a new trial may be granted under Rule 59, the evidence must\npertain to facts in existence at the time of the trial, and not to facts that have occurred subsequently.\" Id. at\n59-115 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). According to the testimony of Lowell Hewitt, Superintendent of the\nHuntingdon facility, the improvements cited by defendants were largely accomplished in late 1977, well after our\ntrial of the issue and therefore cannot be the basis of a motion for a new trial or amendment of judgment. It\nappears, then, that none of the 59(a)(2) grounds for relief is present here.\nDefendants' motion seems more properly within the scope of Rule 60(b)(5) than Rule 59(a)(2). Rule 60(b)(5)\nprovides inter alia that \"[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final\njudgment, order or proceeding [if] it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\"\nThis, we think, is the logical foundation for defendants' request and the parties tacitly agree, both sides having\nidentified the \"key question\" as whether it is now \"inequitable\" to give our May 30th order \"prospective\napplication.\" Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs' Answer to Defendants' Motion for New Trial at 2; Reply\nto Plaintiffs' Answer to Defendants' Motion at 2. Because the parties have treated defendants' motion as a Rule\n60(b)(5) issue, despite the incongruous Rule 59 caption, and because defendants are still well within the Rule 60\n(b)(5) \"reasonable time\" filing limitation, it would be the most hollow formalism for us to dismiss the motion as\nimproperly brought and await a re-labelling of the pleadings. Accordingly, we will consider defendants' argument\nas though it were in title as well as fact a 60(b)(5) motion.\nAmong the showings that may justify vacation of a restraint under Rule 60(b)(5) is proof of a subsequent change\nin the controlling facts on which the injunction rested. 7 Moore's Federal Practice at 334. A motion for relief from\njudgment on such grounds is addressed to the sound discretion of the district court and \"its exercise of that\ndiscretion will not be disturbed unless there was clear error and abuse of discretion.\" Securities Exchange\nCommission v. Warren, 583 F.2d 115, 120 (3d Cir. 1978). See Girard Trust Bank v. Martin, 557 F.2d 386 (3d Cir.)\ncert. denied,434 U.S. 985, 98 S.Ct. 612, 54 L.Ed.2d 479 (1977); Virgin Islands National Bank v. Tyson, 506 F.2d\n802 (3d Cir. 1974),cert. denied,421 U.S. 976, 95 S.Ct. 1976, 44 L.Ed.2d 467 (1975). In exercising our discretion\nwe are to be guided by equitable principles, as the Rule expressly instructs, and by the interests of justice, 7 \nMoore's Federal Practice at 331. Although Rule 60 unmistakably envisions the dissolution of certain restraints,\nthe Third Circuit, citing the need for the finality of judgments, has recently cautioned that injunctions \"are not to be\nlightly vacated.\" Securities Exchange Commission v. Warren, 583 F.2d at 122.\n525 Indeed, our Circuit last year reversed, as an abuse of discretion, a district court order *525 granting relief from a\nconsent injunction prohibiting confinement of prisoners in a basement facility, known as the Behavioral\nAdjustment Unit (BAU), at the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh. In Mayberry v. Maroney, 558 F.2d 1159\n(3d Cir. 1977), the Commonwealth sought dissolution of the restraint decree under Rule 60(b), without offering\nany evidence of changed circumstances in the B.A.U. The trial court's approval of defendants' request was held\ninsupportable \"because the record [was] barren of facts indicating any entitlement to 60(b) relief.\" Id. at 1163. In\nhis opinion for a unanimous panel, Judge Layton expressly noted that because intolerable physical conditions\nhad been one of the sources of the complaint a showing that \"the physical conditions existing in the B.A.U. had\nbeen improved\" would be probative of changed circumstances justifying a vacation of the consent judgment. Id.\n[2]\nat 1164.  Our duty here, then, is to determine, consistent with the above considerations, whether the changed\nconditions in the Glass Cage that defendants have proven eliminate the cruel and unusual elements on which our\n\noriginal decision rested such that continued application of the injunction against use of the observation unit is\n[3]\ninequitable.\nIII. THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT ISSUE:\nA federal court asked to determine the constitutionality of a prison unit \"cannot dictate to state officials the\nconditions which the court may feel, as a matter of enlightened and advanced prison theory, should prevail in\nstate penitentiaries.\" Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 451 F.Supp. at 895. State authorities are to be allowed\nbroad latitude in regulating the prison environment in light of the acknowledged penological goals of deterrence,\nrehabilitation and institutional security, Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119,\n125-26, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822-26, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d\n495 (1974), and only when penal conditions amount to cruel and unusual punishment should a federal court\nexercise its remedial powers. However, if cruel and unusual circumstances are proven, we are not only\nauthorized to intervene, Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974), but are\nduty-bound by the Eighth Amendment to do so.\nBecause the concept of cruel and unusual punishment \"must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society,\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2\nL.Ed.2d 630 (1958), a static Eighth Amendment test cannot be articulated. Certain fundamental measurements\ncan, however, be stated. Of particular relevance as a departure point here is the clear determination that solitary\nconfinement is not per se impermissible under the Eighth Amendment. U. S. ex rel. Tyrrell v. Speaker, 471 F.2d\n1197, 1202 (3d Cir. 1973). Equally clear, though, is that \"confinement in which the isolation cells provided\ninadequate space, heating, ventilation, lighting or sanitary conditions or where the inmates received inadequate\nitems of personal hygiene, food or clothing, [is] cruel and unusual punishment.\" Imprisoned Citizens Union v.\nShapp, 451 F.Supp. at 896 (citations omitted). In holding the unimproved Glass Cage unconstitutional, we\npointed to such physical factors, writing that \"we were genuinely shocked by the dark, dirty, and totally isolated\nconditions we observed.\" Id. at 898. The characterization of our reaction to conditions in the observation cells as\n526 \"genuinely shocked\" was advised, because \"physical and mental abuse *526 . . . of such base, inhumane, and\nbarbaric proportions so as to shock and offend a court's sensibilities,\" Burns v. Swenson, 430 F.2d 771, 778 (8th\nCir. 1970),cert. denied,404 U.S. 1062, 92 S.Ct. 743, 30 L.Ed.2d 751 (1972) (emphasis added), is constitutionally\nproscribed.\nDefendants contend that conditions in the Glass Cage are no longer shocking or offensive. At a hearing held\nOctober 27, 1978 the parties stipulated to several improvements in the three Huntingdon cells, including: (a) the\nrepair of all faucets and commodes to an operating condition; (b) the placement of removable mattresses in each\nof the units; (c) the fresh painting of the cells and adjacent area; and (d) the dispelling of a pervasive unpleasant\nodor. Further, plaintiffs' counsel told us at the hearing that on an October 22, 1978 visit to Huntingdon he had\nfound the Glass Cage area to be \"immaculately clean.\" This renovation, largely accomplished in late 1977, is\nevidenced by sixteen photographs that defendants introduced with the testimony of Mr. Hewitt, the corrections\nofficial in charge of the Huntingdon facility. Supplementing the pictures and statements of Superintendent Hewitt\nwas the testimony of Robert K. Rhodes, Director of Maintenance and Construction, Pennsylvania Bureau of\nCorrections. We heard from Mr. Rhodes that the ventilation, lighting and size measurements for the Glass Cage\nmeet the relevant standards. Not only was Mr. Rhodes' technical testimony not contradicted by plaintiffs, it was\ncorroborated by the statements of their own expert, Dr. James H. Gilfoil.\nIn addition to improving physically the controversial cells, the Commonwealth has, since our last consideration of\nthe issue, adopted explicit administrative procedures for placement of an inmate in the Glass Cage. According to\nthe testimony of William C. Robinson, Commissioner of the Bureau of Corrections, before 1977 the controversial\ncells were indiscriminately used for punitive purposes. In June of 1977 the Commissioner decided that the Glass\nCage should be used only as a short-term isolation facility for inmates whose segregation was necessary to\nprotect the institution from disruption or the inmate from other prisoners or from himself. To implement this\nchange of policy, approval by the Deputy Commissioner of Corrections is now required before an inmate can be\nassigned to the observation cells. The procedures call for Superintendent Hewitt to be informed of a proposed\nplacement and for him then to clear the assignment with the Deputy Commissioner. Approval by the\n\nCommissioner's office is to be renewed every twenty-four hours. Once approved, an inmate's confinement in the\nGlass Cage is governed by internal Huntingdon rules that require an immediate medical examination and\npsychiatric attention within the next day. State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon: Administrative Directive\n80100Assignment of Inmates to Cells in Disciplinary Custody Maximum00Observation00November 15, 1977.\n97 97 97\nBetween the time that these procedures were adopted in June 1977 and the closing of the isolation cells in May\n1978 pursuant to our Order, ten inmates were confined in the Glass Cage, for an average of six days each.\nPlaintiffs express skepticism that the new procedures are significant, but they do not question that the rules were\nin good faith followed in those ten placements.\nAlthough we did not discuss the procedure for use of the Glass Cage in our opinion closing the area, we think\nthat the purpose for and manner in which the cells are used is relevant to their constitutionality. Confinement that\nwould be permissible if for a short time may become cruel and unusual if lengthy. Similarly, conditions that would\nbe allowable if monitored may be intolerable if unregulated. Our reference to the duration and nature of\nconfinement in the solitary units at Graterford and Dallas, Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 451 F.Supp. at\n896-97, suggests our implicit reliance on such factors in determining the constitutionality of a facility. Accordingly,\n527 we will include the new procedures for *527 placement in the Glass Cage in our Eighth Amendment calculus.[4]\nDespite improved conditions and procedures, confinement in the Glass Cage is still harsh. The Huntingdon\ninstitution contains 1165 cells, 144 of which constitute the maximum security area. Within the maximum block is a\nDisciplinary Custody Maximum (DCM) unit of 17 cells. The observation cells are isolated behind a glass wall\nwithin this DCM area. Four steel doors separate the Glass Cage from the general prison population. A prisoner is\nnot allowed to take personal property to the isolation cells. He is initially denied personal items, including reading\nand writing material, because, according to Superintendent Hewitt, such property can be used by an agitated\ninmate to flood the cell by jamming the plumbing fixtures. However, if a calm, lucid request is made, a prisoner\nwill be permitted to read and write. The parties agree that the lighting in the Glass Cage, which comes entirely\nfrom 75 watt bulbs mounted directly outside each cell and in the vestibule area between the cells and the glass\nwall, is adequate for reading.\nDr. Gilfoil, a psychiatrist who toured Huntingdon on October 22nd and testified for plaintiffs at the October 27th\nhearing, stated that the lighting, although dim, was sufficient for reading, and Mr. Rhodes, the maintenance\nsupervisor, testified that the isolation cells are as well lit as an average home. We must thus conclude that our\n1975 observation that \"[o]utside lighting is totally inadequate for reading\" Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp,\n451 F.Supp. at 898, is no longer accurate. The lighting cannot, however, be controlled from the observation cell,\nnor can an inmate confined in the Glass Cage regulate the heat or ventilation. The observation cell environment\nis wholly beyond the control of the prisoner.\nWe are persuaded that the Glass Cage, although bleak, is no longer cruel and unusual punishment. Our decision\nis based on the physical and procedural improvements that the parties agree have been made since our last visit\nover three years ago. Just as our conclusion then was expressly based on the sensual affront that we\nexperienced in viewing the observation cells, we have here been influenced by the image that emerges from a\nstudy of defendants' photographs. The pictures convince us that circumstances have changed to the point where\nthe units, while stark, are not offensive. \"There is no question that the cells in the [Glass Cage] are grim and\ncheerless. Nonetheless, we conclude that these conditions are not so inhumane or base that they shock the\ncourt's conscience or violate standards of human decency. Similarly, we find that such confinement is rationally\nrelated to legitimate penal goals [of security and deterrence] and thus meets constitutional standards.\" \nImprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 451 F.Supp. at 897 (upholding use of B.A.U. at Graterford).\nOur judgment, like all cruel and unusual punishment decisions, is largely and necessarily impressionistic, there\nbeing no eternal sextant with which to survey the boundaries of the Eighth Amendment. We can and must,\n[5]\nhowever, point to certain objective facts that we find especially significant.  When we last toured the cells we\nfound no mattresses. Today there is a removable one in each unit. In 1975 we found the lighting inadequate for\n528 reading and the ventilation insufficient. We have *528 since learned that the light is sufficient for reading and that\nthe ventilation fan is operating and adequate. The Glass Cage was unclean and pervaded by an unpleasant odor\nwhen we visited it. On October 22, 1978 plaintiffs found the area \"immaculate.\" In short, \"the dark, dirty and\ntotally isolated conditions we observed\" three years ago are now neither dark nor dirty, although the utter isolation\n\nof course remains. Because isolation alone, which here is governed by stringent procedures, does not violate the\nEighth Amendment, United States ex rel. Tyrrell v. Speaker, 471 F.2d 1197, 1202 (3d Cir. 1973), we no longer find\nthe observation cells constitutionally objectionable.\nOur conclusion is reinforced by considering the implications of plaintiffs' arguments that the Glass Cage is still\ncruel and unusual punishment. Two main lines of opposition to our decision are urged.\nFirst, plaintiffs have attempted, with good success, to demonstrate that the three observation cells are not\nnecessary to maintain security at Huntingdon. Superintendent Hewitt testified on cross examination that the\npenological purposes served by the Glass Cage could be, to a degree, accomplished by stripping some of the\nfourteen other D.C.M. cells which had never been in his experience too heavily populated for such a project to be\npractical. Were it for us to decide, we would agree with plaintiffs that the Commonwealth's own statements prove\nthat the Glass Cage is not indispensable. However, federal courts do not sit to supervise state prisons, Cruz v.\nBeto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972), and the decision whether to use the observation\ncells, given constitutionally satisfactory conditions, is \"peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials.\" Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2806, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974). Plaintiffs'\ndisproof of a necessity for the Glass Cage is thus misguided. A showing that the observation cells are so\nunnecessary that they are not reasonably related to a legitimate penal goal would be highly relevant, Imprisoned\nCitizens Union v. Shapp, 451 F.Supp. at 895-96, but such is not plaintiffs' argument. Because plaintiffs urge us to\nenter an administrative thicket beyond the path of Eighth Amendment analysis, we must reject their evidence that\nthe Glass Cage is not needed.\nPlaintiffs second and more vigorously urged line of argument is that the observation cells are cruel and unusual\npunishment because they are inappropriate confinement for a psychiatrically disturbed inmate. Dr. Gilfoil,\nplaintiffs' expert witness, testified at length about the adverse repercussions that confinement in a sensory\ndeprivation environment like the Glass Cage can have on an already unstable prisoner. He stated his opinion that\nafter one or two days in solitary most inmates have a psychotic episode and recounted his own experience of\nmild disorientation and visual and auditory hallucinations after a brief time in a Huntingdon isolation unit.\nRecommending padded cells and constant psychiatric supervision for the class of inmates who would be\nconfined in the Glass Cage under the new guidelines, Dr. Gilfoil concluded that isolation of these prisoners would\nbe \"better accomplished in a hospital setting.\" We again find ourselves agreeing with plaintiffs testimony but\nlacking authority to decide accordingly.\nClearly, the Glass Cage is not the most desirable facility for a psychiatrically agitated inmate. We certainly think\nthat hospitalization would be better and Superintendent Hewitt agrees, as his frank testimony that the observation\n[6]\ncells are inappropriate for \"committable,\"  as opposed to disorderly, prisoners shows. The question before us,\nhowever, is not and cannot be whether the Glass Cage is medically desirable confinement. Rather, we must ask\nwhether the observation cells are so undesirable as to be \"shocking\", \"offensive\", \"inhumane,\" \"base\" or\n529 \"barbaric.\" The list of *529 Eighth Amendment adjectives is long but not endless, and undesirable is not among\nthem. Implicit in Dr. Gilfoil's testimony is the conclusion that all solitary confinement is shocking and inhumane\npunishment because void of sensory stimuli and therefore, in his opinion, psychiatrically unwise. Plaintiffs argued\nas much in their summation, urging that \"it may well be that `committable' inmates can't be constitutionally\nconfined anywhere in the D.C.M.\" area at Huntingdon. This position is untenable given the present state of the\nlaw in our Circuit. U. S. ex rel. Tyrrell v. Speaker, 471 F.2d 1197, 1202 (3d Cir. 1973). Some day, perhaps soon,\n\"the evolving standards of decency . . . of [our] maturing society,\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590,\n598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630, may condemn solitary confinement, but unless and until that happens medical warnings\nagainst sensory deprivation must be admonitory only, not binding on state corrections officials.\nCONCLUSION:\nBecause we are convinced that the observation cells at Huntingdon are now constitutionally tolerable, it is no\nlonger equitable that our injunction against their use have prospective application. Despite full respect for the\nfinality of judgments, we will, in light of significantly changed circumstances, dissolve our restraint. We shall,\n\nhowever, make the dissolution contingent on maintenance of the improved cells and sternly caution that a\ndeterioration of conditions in the Glass Cage will not be allowed.\n[1] The precise language defendants purport to move under is in Rule 59(a)(2): \n\"A new trial may be granted . . . in an action tried without a jury, for any of the reasons for which rehearings have\nheretofore been granted in suits in equity in the courts of the United States. On a motion for a new trial in an\naction tried without a jury, the court may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony,\namend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a\nnew judgment.\"\n[2] The Securities Exchange Commission v. Warren panel, in its discussion of Mayberry, reiterated the centrality\nof evidence of improved physical conditions to a 60(b) motion for relief from an order that confinement facilities\nnot be used. Securities Exchange Commission v. Warren, 583 F.2d at 119 n. 6.\n[3] Plaintiffs do not contend that even if we conclude that the improved Glass Cage is constitutional we should\nnonetheless deny defendants' motion for relief. Our answer to the constitutional question will therefore a fortiori\ndecide the 60(b)(5) issue as well.\n[4] In Mayberry v. Maroney, 558 F.2d at 1163-64, the Third Circuit rejected the district court's holding that a new\nprocedure limiting confinement in the B.A.U. to 24 hours was a changed circumstance justifying relief from the\ninjunction prohibiting use of the cells. We read Judge Layton's opinion as denying the sufficiency of such a\nshowing, not its relevance, and therefore consider our conclusion that evidence of new procedures may be\nweighed to be harmonious with Mayberry.\n[5] That our decision here is, to the extent possible, a critical rather than impulsive one is evidenced by our\nconclusion that for us, personally, being deprived of reading and writing materials, as inmates in the Glass Cage\nare, would be per se cruel and unusual punishment. We recognize of course that such a deprivation does not,\nwithout more, violate the Eighth Amendment. Thus, our private values have been subordinated to a more societal\nsense of decency in our evaluation of the observation cells.\n[6] Superintendent Hewitt defined \"committable\" inmates as those who had posed a direct threat to themselves or\nothers because of an act within 30 days past. These prisoners, Hewitt said, can be committed to a state hospital\nunder Pennsylvania law. 50 P.S. § 4101 et seq.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Pennsylvania.\nDecember 9, 1996.\nStephan Presser, American Liberties Foundation, Philadelphia, PA, for Plaintiff.\nFrancis R. Filipi, Office of Attorney General (PA), Harrisburg, PA, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM\nDuBOIS, District Judge.\nI. BACKGROUND\nBetween 1970 and 1971 four related cases challenging the constitutionality of conditions and policies at a\n336 number of Pennsylvania State Correctional Institutions were filed in this Court. On May 22, 1978, after those *336\nsuits were consolidated and a plaintiff class certified, then 00 Chief Judge Joseph S. Lord, III approved a Consent\n97\nDecree settling the majority of issues raised. Judge Lord addressed the remaining issues in subsequent\nOpinions.\nA motion for the issuance of an order to show cause and for contempt judgment was filed by plaintiffs in 1980. On\nDecember 30, 1980, with the assistance of United States Magistrate Judge William F. Hall, the parties stipulated\nto the dismissal of the outstanding allegations of contempt. With the further assistance of Magistrate Judge Hall,\nthe 1980 Stipulation was amended by an agreement of the parties, approved by Judge Lord on May 11, 1983.\nSince 1983 a number of motions alleging violations of the Consent Decree have been filed with and, adjudicated\nby, this Court.\n[1]\nThere are a number of motions presently pending before this Court,  each raising one or more of the following\nfour procedural issues:\n1) the scope of the plaintiff class;\n2) whether individual violations of the Consent Decree may be remedied by the Court;\n3) whether pro se submissions may be considered by the Court; and\n4) whether inmates must exhaust their available administrative remedies before petitioning this Court for relief.\nThese issues are the subject of this Memorandum. Applying the conclusions set forth in this Memorandum, the\nCourt will rule on each pending motion by separate Order.\n\nII. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF\nCONSENT DECREES\nIn 1971, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 29 L.Ed.2d 256\n(1971). Writing for the Court, Justice Marshall set forth the basic framework for the interpretation of consent\ndecrees. He wrote:\nConsent decrees are entered into by parties to a case after careful negotiation has produced\nagreement on their precise terms. The parties waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the\ncase.... Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise.... Thus the decree\nitself cannot be said to have a purpose; rather the parties have purposes, generally opposed to\neach other, and the resultant decree embodies as much of those opposing purposes as the\nrespective parties have the bargaining power and skill to achieve. For these reasons, the scope of\na consent decree must be discerned within its four corners, and not by reference to what might\nsatisfy the purposes of one of the parties to it. Id. at 681-82, 91 S.Ct. at 1757 (footnote omitted).\nThe Third Circuit has summarized the basic principles of Armour in the following manner: \"Although consent\n337 decrees are judicial *337 acts, they have many of the attributes of contracts voluntarily undertaken, and are\nconstrued according to traditional precepts of contract construction.\" Fox v. United States Dep't of Housing and\nUrban Development, et al., 680 F.2d 315, 319 (3rd Cir.1982) (citations omitted). In interpreting the Imprisoned\nCitizens Union Consent Decree this Court has always followed the dictates of Armour and will continue to do so. \nSee Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, CA No. 70-354, slip op. at 5, 6, 12, 29 (E.D.Pa. Nov. 25, 1987).\nIII. JURISDICTION\nIn 1988 Judge Lord noted that \"[u]nder the terms of the Consent Decree, I have retained jurisdiction over it and\nproceedings have continued.\" Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 1988 WL 59270 (E.D.Pa. June 8, 1988).\nUnder § XXVII of the Consent Decree this Court continues to retain jurisdiction over both this lawsuit and the\nConsent Decree. Consent Decree, at 17 (\"[T]he Court retains jurisdiction of this action. ...\").\nFurthermore, § XIX of the Consent Decree preserves plaintiffs' right to bring certain types of complaints before\nthis Court. In reference to defendants' right to alter administrative remedies, § XIX states that \"plaintiffs reserve\ntheir right to contest in this Court any such amendment, suspension, alteration or modification of the provisions of\nthis Consent Decree.\" Consent Decree, at 14. Continuing, that section provides that \"[p]laintiffs also reserve the\nright to contest in this Court, at any time, by any appropriate legal proceeding, any institution or system wide\npattern of failure or refusal by defendants or their agents or employees to follow the provisions of this Consent\nDecree.\" Id. at 15.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. The Scope of the Plaintiff Class\nA number of the pending motions have been filed by inmates confined at state correctional institutions which\ndefendants argue are not covered by the Consent Decree. Defendants assert that only inmates in the institutions\nincluded in the plaintiff class 00 which defendants assert includes only State Correctional Institution (\"SCI\") 00\n97 97\nGraterford, SCI-Dallas, SCI-Huntingdon, SCI-Muncy, SCI-Rockview and SCI-Pittsburgh 00 have any rights under\n97\nthe Consent Decree. The inmates confined in other state correctional institutions argue that the coverage of the\nConsent Decree was expanded when the Decree was modified in 1983. The SCI-Camp Hill inmates also argue\nthat the language of § V of the Consent Decree includes inmates at institutions other than the six named in the\nclass certification Order.\n\nJudge Lord's October 20, 1972 Order certifying the plaintiff class clearly limits membership in the class to those\ninmates confined at SCI-Graterford, SCI-Dallas, SCI-Huntingdon, SCI-Muncy, SCI-Rockview and SCI-Pittsburgh.\nThat Order reads, in its entirety, as follows:\nAND NOW, to wit, this 20th day of October, 1972, it is hereby ordered that Plaintiffs' Motion that\nthe instant suit be maintained as a Class Action on behalf of themselves and all other persons\nwho are now or will be incarcerated in the Pennsylvania State Correctional Institutions at\nGraterford, Dallas, Huntingdon, Muncy, Rockview and Pittsburgh is hereby granted.\nThe Court concludes that § V of the Consent Decree does not expand the plaintiff class as argued by the inmates\nat SCI-Camp Hill. That provision, entitled \"Compliance With Administrative Directives,\" reads as follows:\nDefendants shall comply with the regulations of the Bureau of Correction (hereinafter the\n\"Administrative Directives\") and the amendments and additions thereto.\nDefendants shall expend their best efforts to assure compliance with this Consent Decree and\nwith the Administrative Directives and the amendments and additions thereto by all institutional\nstaff members, and all other persons subject to defendants' jurisdiction.\nSection V does nothing more than require defendants to comply with the Consent Decree and the regulations of\n338 the *338 Bureau of Correction.[2] The fact that the Bureau was required to comply with the regulations with\nrespect to inmates at the two other correctional facilities in operation at the time, SCI-Camp Hill and Regional\nCorrectional Facility at Greensburg, is of no significance in determining the scope of the plaintiff class. Inmates at\nthe latter institutions have the right to seek redress for violations of the regulations in an appropriate court.\nInmates who are members of the plaintiff class may enforce such rights in this Court upon compliance with all of\n[3]\nthe requirements of the Consent Decree.\nThere are no other provisions of the Consent Decree which even arguably affect the composition of the plaintiff\nclass. Thus, unless the scope of the plaintiff class was altered at some time after its certification, the class is\nlimited to the six institutions named in the October 20, 1972 Order.\nThe argument that the plaintiff class was expanded by the 1983 Report and Recommendation of Magistrate\nJudge Hall is without merit. Magistrate Judge Hall expressly noted in the Report and Recommendation that after\nJudge Lord consolidated the original four cases, \"a class was certified which consisted of all inmates then\nconfined and all inmates to be confined in the future in the state correctional institutions at Dallas, Graterford,\nHuntingdon, Muncy, Pittsburgh, and Rockview.\" R & R, at 1. The Magistrate Judge did not recommend expansion\nof the class, and Judge Lord approved the 1983 Report and Recommendation in its entirety 00 including its\n97\ndefinition of the plaintiff class as limited to those six institutions. Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, CA No.\n70-3054 (E.D.Pa. May 11, 1983) (unpublished Order).\nThe inmates who filed motions have not specified the part or parts of the 1983 Report and Recommendation on\nwhich they rely in support of their position. There is, however, only one sentence in the Report and\nRecommendation which makes references to \"all state correctional institutions,\" and it is inapposite. That\nsentence reads as follows: \"The directive establishing the Consolidated [Inmate Grievance] System will apply to\nall state correctional institutions (and state regional correctional facilities and community service centers).\" R & R,\n339 at 4. The statement clearly applies to the directive which established a new internal complaint system *339 in all\nstate correctional institutions. Magistrate Judge Hall noted in the Report and Recommendation nothing more than\nthe fact that the directive would apply to all state correctional institutions; his statement does not apply to the\ncomposition of the plaintiff class.\nFurthermore, in two rulings issued ten years apart Judge Lord left no doubt that the plaintiff class is limited to the\nsix state correctional institutions named in the class certification Order. On June 7, 1978 Judge Lord wrote that\n\"[p]laintiffs represent a class comprising all persons who are now or will be incarcerated in the Pennsylvania\nState Correctional Institutions at Graterford, Dallas, Huntingdon, Muncy, Rockview and Pittsburgh.\" Imprisoned\nCitizens Union v. Shapp, 451 F.Supp. 893, 894 (E.D.Pa.1978). Ten years later, in a Memorandum issued on June\n\n8, 1988, Judge Lord considered an attorney's fee petition filed by one of plaintiffs' attorneys. In ruling on that\npetition, Judge Lord wrote that \"the plaintiff class compris[es] prisoners at several Pennsylvania Correctional\nInstitutions....\" Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 1988 WL 59270, *1 (E.D.Pa. June 8, 1988) (emphasis\nadded). Although Judge Lord did not specify the institutions to which he referred in that Memorandum, the words\n\"at several\" make it clear that the plaintiff class to which he referred was smaller than the entire inmate population\nof Pennsylvania's correctional institutions.\nAlthough not argued by movants or class counsel, language used by Judge Lord in his June 18, 1979 Opinion,\nstanding alone, might lend support to the contention that the plaintiff class includes inmates at institutions other\nthan the six listed in the class certification Order. On June 18, 1979, Judge Lord wrote that \"On October 20, 1972\nI certified a class consisting of the named plaintiffs and `all other persons who are now or will be incarcerated in\nthe Pennsylvania State Correctional Institutions....'\" Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 473 F.Supp. 1017, 1019\n(E.D.Pa.1979) (quoting the Order that certified the class). Later in that Opinion, Judge Lord addressed the size of\nthe plaintiff class as part of his discussion of the award of attorney's fees to class counsel, stating that \"[b]ecause\nplaintiff class consisted of all inmates present and future, of the Commonwealth's prison system, the number of\npersons who have benefited from Mr. Levine's efforts in this action is large.\" Id. at 1027. However, Judge Lord's\nJune 18, 1979 Opinion does not stand alone, and the Court concludes that the Opinion did not expand the size of\nthe plaintiff class.\nJudge Lord's reference to the class certification Order in his Opinion of June 18, 1979 omitted the limiting\nlanguage of the Order. Had the omitted language been included, that sentence, which is quoted above, would\nhave read as follows: On October 20, 1972 I certified a class consisting of the named plaintiffs and \"all other\npersons who are now or will be incarcerated in the Pennsylvania State Correctional Institutions at Graterford,\nDallas, Huntingdon, Muncy, Rockview and Pittsburgh....\" (language omitted in June 18, 1979 Opinion\nemphasized). Furthermore, as was discussed above, both before and after the June 18, 1979 Opinion Judge\nLord noted in other Imprisoned Citizens Union related documents that the plaintiff class consisted of only those\ninmates incarcerated at the six named institutions. See supra 338-339. In sum, the Court does not find that the\nplaintiff class was expanded by the June 18, 1979 Opinion in the face of the otherwise consistent limitation of the\nclass throughout the long history of this litigation to inmates imprisoned in one of the six state correctional\ninstitutions named in the original class certification Order.\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the plaintiff class is limited to inmates confined at SCI-Graterford, SCI-\nDallas, SCI-Huntingdon, SCI-Muncy, SCI-Pittsburgh and SCI-Rockview when the class was certified or at any\n340 time thereafter.[4] The Consent *340 Decree applies to those inmates only, not to the entire state correctional\nsystem.\nB. Only Allegations of Institution or System Wide Violations of The\nConsent Decree May Be Brought Before This Court\nDefendants assert that only allegations of institution or system wide violations of the Consent Decree may be\nconsidered by the Court. None of the inmates who filed the pending motions take the position that there is no\nsuch requirement. However, a number of the motions allege individual, not institution or system wide, violations of\nthe Consent Decree.\nThe Consent Decree expressly provides for the consideration of institution or system wide violations of the\nConsent Decree by this Court. Section XIX of the Consent Decree states that \"[p]laintiffs also reserve the right to\ncontest in this Court, at any time, by any appropriate legal proceeding, any institution or system wide pattern of\nfailure or refusal by defendants or their agents or employees to follow the provisions of this Consent Decree.\"\nConsent Decree, at 15 (emphasis added). Although that language does not necessarily limit this Court's\njurisdiction to such violations of the Consent Decree, § XXIII creates such a limitation.\nSection XXIII states that \"This Decree shall not create a private cause of action in any individual against any of\nthe defendants. Nor, except as provided in section XIX above, shall this Decree provide a basis for contempt\nproceedings.\" Id. at 16 (emphasis added). The only bases for a contempt proceeding provided by § XIX are\n\ninstitution or system wide violations of the Consent Decree. Reading §§ XIX and XXIII together, it is clear that\nalleged violations of the Consent Decree that are not system or institution wide may not be brought before this\nCourt. This Court's prior holdings are consistent with this interpretation of the Consent Decree.\nThe requirement of the Consent Decree that contempt actions could only be brought for institution or system wide\nviolations of the Decree was also addressed by Magistrate Judge Hall in his 1983 Report and Recommendation.\nIn his Memorandum approving the Report and Recommendation, after recounting the history of the Consent\nDecree, Judge Lord noted that the Court had been inundated with complaints of violations of the Consent\nDecree. Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, CA No. 70-3054, slip op. at 1 (E.D.Pa. May 11, 1983). Concluding\nthat many of the complaints were not properly before the Court, Judge Lord stated that others \"may well have\nbeen either institution-wide or state-wide and therefore in violation of the Consent Decree's state-wide reach.\" Id.\nThis Court most recently considered the validity of the institution or system wide violation requirement in 1987.\nJudge Lord stressed that requirement in his 1987 Opinion, reiterating \"the parties' agreement that individual\nviolations of the Consent Decree will not, by themselves, be actionable in contempt proceedings.\" Imprisoned\nCitizens Union v. Shapp, CA No. 70-3054, slip op. at 6 (E.D.Pa. Nov. 25, 1987). Continuing, Judge Lord cited the\nConsent Decree and the 1980 Stipulation for the proposition that \"the only basis for a judgment of contempt shall\nbe an `institution or system wide pattern of failure or refusal by defendants or their agents or employees to follow\nthe provisions of this Consent Decree.'\" Id. at 6-7 (quoting Consent Decree, at 15 and citing Consent Decree, at\n§§ XIX and XXIII; 1980 Stipulation, at 14).\nAccordingly, the Court will not consider any contempt motions alleging violations of the Consent Decree that are\nnot institution or system wide.\nC. The Court Will Not Consider Pro Se Filings\n341 Section XIX of the Consent Decree states that \"[p]laintiffs also reserve the right *341 to contest in this Court, at\nany time, by any appropriate legal proceeding, any institution or system wide pattern of failure or refusal by\ndefendants or their agents or employees to follow the provisions of this Consent Decree.\" Consent Decree, at 15\n(emphasis added). Although the phrase \"[p]laintiffs also reserve\" evidences the fact that this right is reserved by\nthe members of the plaintiff class, that phrase does not grant individual members the right to file pro se claims of\nviolations of the Consent Decree in this Court. Rather, members of the class may only initiate \"any appropriate\nlegal proceeding\" if they seek to remedy such violations. And, it is clear that the only appropriate legal proceeding\nin a class action is one initiated by class counsel.\nThe cases addressing the alleged right of a class member to proceed pro se rather than through class counsel\nconclude that such action is inappropriate. In 1988 the Fifth Circuit stated that \"[i]ndividual members of the class\n... may assert any equitable or declaratory claims they have, but they must do so by urging further action through\nthe class representative and attorney, including contempt proceedings or by intervention in the class action.\" \nGillespie v. Crawford, 858 F.2d 1101, 1103 (5th Cir.1988); see also Long v. Collins, 917 F.2d 3 (5th Cir.1990).\nCiting Long, the Tenth Circuit held in McNeil v. Guthrie, 945 F.2d 1163 (10th Cir.1991), that \"individual prisoners\nlack standing to individually litigate matters relating to [a] class action.\" Id. at 1166 (citing Long, 917 F.2d at 4-5\n(5th Cir.1990) and Goff v. Menke, 672 F.2d 702, 704 (8th Cir.1982)).\nThe Eighth Circuit has also addressed this question, concluding that the district court had abused its equitable\npower by granting class-wide relief upon the filing of a pro se motion to enforce a preliminary injunction that had\nbeen issued in another suit. Goff, 672 F.2d at 704. In so holding the Eighth Circuit explained that \"[f]or reasons of\nlaw as well as judicial economy ... to the extent that injunctive relief was sought, Goff [the prisoner proceeding pro\nse] should have been required to proceed through the class representative or through intervention.\" Id.\nThe rule of the aforementioned cases is designed to allow a court to effectively administer justice in a class action\nsuit, without being inundated with filings from each individual member of the class 00 a problem illustrated by the\n97\ncurrent posture of this litigation. Class counsel has notified the Court that he will not adopt the vast majority of the\npro se motions pending before this Court because he believes that most of those motions are either procedurally\nbarred or without merit. As the class members' advocate, class counsel is duty-bound to aggressively pursue any\n\nallegations of institution or system wide violations of the Consent Decree that he believes are meritorious. Class\ncounsel has done so in the past, and the Court has been provided with no reason to believe that he will not\ncontinue to do so. The requirements of judicial economy and the logic of the aforementioned cases compel the\nCourt to conclude that pro se requests for enforcement of the Consent Decree should not be considered.\nFurthermore, the Court's ruling on this issue is consistent with the prior rulings of other Judges on this Court. In at\nleast six prior instances the Court has denied motions because \"plaintiffs ha[d] not enlisted the assistance of\nclass counsel in filing th[e] motion[s] and, therefore, ha[d] not complied with the consent decree's procedural\nrequirements for the prosecution of violations....\" Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, CA No. 70-3054 (E.D.Pa.\n[5]\nOct. 16, 1992) (unpublished Order) (Dalzell, J.).\n342 *342 Accordingly, this Court holds that all allegations of institution or system wide violations of the Consent\nDecree must be made in Motions for Contempt of the Consent Decree filed by class counsel.\nD. Inmates Must Exhaust Their Administrative Remedies Before The\nCourt Will Consider Alleged Violations of the Consent Decree\nDefendants assert that inmates must exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking relief in this Court.\nAlthough it does not appear that any of the inmates who filed the pending motions take the position that there is\nno such requirement, a number of the motions do not provide evidence of exhaustion. Furthermore, defendants\n[6]\nargue that a number of the movants have not exhausted their administrative remedies.\nIn 1987, Judge Lord wrote that \"pursuant to the parties' agreement and my order of May 11, 1983 approving their\nAmendment to the Stipulation for Dismissal, plaintiffs must exhaust the inmate grievance procedure established\nby that stipulation before presenting any claim to the court as part of a contempt proceeding.\" Imprisoned\nCitizens Union v. Shapp, CA No. 70-3054, slip op. at 6 (E.D.Pa. Nov. 25, 1987) (emphasis added). The Order to\nwhich Judge Lord referred was quite explicit. In adopting the 1983 Report and Recommendation, Judge Lord\nordered that ... Pursuant to the terms of settlement, when the administrative procedure for inmate\ngrievances described by Section I.B. of the Stipulation is adopted, members of the plaintiff-class\nmust exhaust that procedure before filing with the court any allegations of violations of the\nConsent Decree and/or any allegations of contempt. Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, CA No.\n70-3054 (E.D.Pa. May 11, 1983) (unpublished Order) (emphasis altered).\nAccordingly, the Court finds that any Motions for Contempt of the Consent Decree may be filed by class counsel\nonly after inmates have exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to the incidents underlying the\n[7]\nmotion.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court holds that it will consider a Motion for Contempt of the Consent Decree\nonly if the Motion:\n1) is filed on behalf of inmates imprisoned at SCI-Graterford, SCI-Dallas, SCI-Huntingdon, SCI-Muncy, SCI-\nPittsburgh or SCI-Rockview at the time the class was certified or at any time thereafter;\n2) alleges an institution or system wide violation of the Consent Decree;\n3) is filed by class counsel; and\n4) is filed after inmates have exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to the incidents underlying the\nmotion.\n343 *343\n\nI.

Admissions and Review\n1. All proceedings pursuant to this directive are in the nature of settlement negotiations and will,\ntherefore, be inadmissible before any court or other tribunal in support of any claim made against\nthe Commonwealth or any employee. No resolution of any grievance offered as a result of this\nprocedure shall be admissible before any court or other tribunal as an admission of violation of the\nICU Consent Decree or any State or federal law.\n\n2. No decision rendered as a result of the processing of a grievance shall be reviewable by any\ncourt unless it establishes a system or institution-wide violation of the decree.\nG. Completion of Review After Transfer\nAny inmate who is transferred after the filing of a grievance or appeal, but prior to the completion\nof the appeal process, may continue to pursue the grievance or appeal by notifying the Facility\nManager or Regional Director of the facility in which confined when the grievance was filed.\nAdjustments in the various time limitations may be made to facilitate review.\nVII. SUSPENSION DURING EMERGENCY\nIn an emergency situation or extended disruption of normal institutional operation, any provision or\nsection of this policy may be suspended by the Commissioner or his/ her designee for a specific\nperiod of time.\nVIII. RIGHTS UNDER THIS POLICY\nThis policy does not create rights in any person nor should it be interpreted or applied in such a\nmanner as to abridge the rights of any individual. This policy should be interpreted to have\nsufficient flexibility so as to be consistent with law and to permit the accomplishment of the\npurpose of the policies of the Department of Corrections.\nIX. SUPERSEDED POLICY AND CROSS-REFERENCE\nThis directive revises the Inmate Grievance System (DC-ADM 804, May 1, 1984), and supersedes\nthe pilot grievance system in effect at selected DOC institutions. It does not supersede or repeal\nany portion of any other directive or policy statement. Where this directive is inconsistent with any\n357 other directive or policy, both shall be *357 interpreted so as to provide full review of all issues\nraised, consistent with the scope and purpose of this directive. Conflicts will most frequently occur\nat the Initial Review level, where other directives establish committees to review specific issues.\nCross References: DC-ADM 801, DC-ADM 802\nACA Cross-References: 3-4271\ncc: Executive Deputy Commissioner Reid Deputy Commissioner Clymer Deputy Commissioner Fulcomer Acting\nDeputy Commissioner Beard All Superintendents CCC Directors (4) File /s/ Joseph D.

The\nexact date the Notice was issued is not recorded in the docket, although the Notice required the filing of\nobjections by April 5, 1976. Notice of Proposed Settlement, at 2. \nClass counsel argues that Judge Lord would not have provided notice to inmates confined at SCI-Camp Hill if he\ndid not believe them to be covered by the Consent Decree. As support for this position class counsel points to the\nfact that Judge Lord provided notice to the inmates at SCI-Camp Hill but not to the inmates at the only other\ncorrectional institution operated by the Department of Corrections in 1975, Regional Correctional Facility at\nGreensburg.\nThe short answer to this argument on behalf of the Camp Hill inmates is that notice of a class action settlement\naddressed to persons not members of the class cannot serve as the basis for including them in the class. The\nCourt finds no basis in the record for concluding that the class includes inmates at SCI-Camp Hill. Moreover, as\nargued by defense counsel, plaintiffs' Motion is time-barred under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3), as it\nwas filed on June 13, 1996, well in excess of a year from the entry date of this Court's Order of January 18, 1995\nin which the Court ruled that inmates at SCI-Camp Hill were not members of the plaintiff class.\nFinally, there was a reason for notifying inmates at SCI-Camp Hill of the settlement 00 inmates at that institution\n97\nwere regularly transferred to and from the six institutions whose inmates are included in the plaintiff class. In\n1975 it was much less likely for prisoners at the Regional Correctional Facility at Greensburg to be transferred to\none of the state correctional institutions. See Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion\nto Reconsider the Court's January 18, 1995, Order, at 3 n. 3 (discussing the Bureau of Correction's 1975 prisoner\ntransfer policy).\n[4] Class Counsel argues in Plaintiff Class Counsel's Response To Motions Filed by Blackiston, Brightwell, Nigro,\nJacobs and Fontroy (Document No. 515), that Camp Hill prisoners should be allowed to enforce the Consent\nDecree to avoid the injustice that would result if the institution at which an inmate is confined will determine his\nrights. However, counsel does not suggest any reason why the Camp Hill inmates' right to file civil rights lawsuits\ndoes not adequately protect those inmates. As Judge Lord stated in 1987, \"the Consent Decree makes clear that\nindividual violations are not to be the basis of a contempt judgment. Of course, that stricture does not preclude an\ninmate from seeking redress in the appropriate court for any violation of his individual rights.\" See Imprisoned\nCitizensUnion v. Shapp, CA No. 70-3054, slip op. at 20 n. 10 (E.D.Pa. November 25, 1987).\n[5] The six instances referred to in the text are docketed as documents 457, 465, 467, 471, 472, and 482.\nDocument 457 is an order issued by Judge Fullam on behalf of Senior Judge Lord, in which Judge Fullam denied\na pro se Motion for Contempt \"without prejudice to the right of counsel for the plaintiff class to renew such petition\nshould counsel consider renewal appropriate\" because \"it appear[ed] that movants' claims [we]re cognizable in\nthe above captioned cases, if at all, only as part of a motion for contempt filed by class counsel and alleging an\ninstitution or system wide violation of the ICU consent decrees.\" Documents 465, 467, 471, 472, and 482 are\nsimilar orders in which Judge Dalzell denied various pro se motions because the movants had not acted through\nclass counsel.\n[6] Some of the Camp Hill inmates have suggested that there should be a futility exception to the exhaustion\nrequirement. See Motion to Vacate Judgment (Document No. 499). Because this Court has held that those\n\ninmates are not members of the plaintiff class, and therefore not parties to the Consent Decree, the Court need\nnot reach this question.\n[7] The administrative remedies in question are contained in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Department of\nCorrections' Inmate Handbook. In particular, two Policy Statements that spell out specific appeals processes are\nmost often implicated by the exhaustion requirement: DC-ADM 801 (Inmate Disciplinary and Restricted Housing\nProcedures) and DC-ADM 804 (Consolidated Inmate Grievance Review System). Copies of these two Policy\nStatements are attached as appendices to this Memorandum.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Pennsylvania.\nJune 18, 1979.\n11001189 *1018*1019 Jack J. Levine, Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiff.\nJ. Andrew Smyser, Deputy Atty. Gen., Harrisburg, Pa., for defendants.\nOPINION\nJOSEPH S. LORD, III, Chief Judge.\nI.\nOn November 4, 1970 this § 1983 action was commenced by twenty-one plaintiffs confined by the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania in six correctional institutions. The complaint alleged that certain of defendants'\npractices, regulations and omissions violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. On October 20, 1972 I certified a\nclass consisting of the named plaintiffs and \"all other persons who are now or will be incarcerated in the\nPennsylvania State Correctional Institutions . . ..\"\nSettlement negotiations were begun after definition of the class. Nearly four years later these talks culminated in\nthe proposal of a consent decree, ultimately approved on May 22, 1978. Implementation and interpretation of that\ndecree is a continuing task.\nDuring the long negotiations, three of the issues raised by plaintiffs were litigated. These were: (1) the availability\nof adequate law libraries; (2) the lawfulness of conditions of solitary confinement at four institutions; and (3)\nconjugal visits. The law library issue was resolved by stipulation in late 1977. In May of 1978 I enjoined on Eighth\nAmendment grounds continued use of three isolation cells at the correctional institution at Huntingdon and upheld\nagainst constitutional attack the Commonwealth's prohibition of conjugal visits. Imprisoned Citizens Union v.\nShapp, 451 F.Supp. 893 (E.D.Pa.1978). After extensive rehabilitation of the solitary confinement units, I dissolved\nmy injunction against use of the cells on November 20, 1978. Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 461 F.Supp.\n522 (E.D.Pa.1978).\n1020 Jack Levine, one of several counsel to plaintiff class, now seeks an award of attorney's *1020 fees and\nexpenses. Compensation is requested pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for time spent negotiating the consent\ndecree and litigating the law library and Huntingdon isolation cell issues. Counsel asks for $21,156.00 in fees and\n$630.59 in costs. For the reasons discussed below, I will approve the claimed expenses and reduce the fee figure\nto $10,374.75.\nII.\nThe Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, pertinently states:\n\"In any action . . . to enforce a provision of section . . . 1983 . . the court, in its discretion, may\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the\ncosts.\"\n\nThere is no Eleventh Amendment bar to applying the statute to litigation, such as this, in which the fee award, if\nany, will be paid with state funds. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978). Thus, if\nplaintiffs here were prevailing parties, Mr. Levine may, in my discretion, recover counsel fees nominally from\ndefendants, although actually from the Commonwealth.\nDefendants do not dispute that plaintiff class was the \"prevailing party\" as to those issues for which\ncompensation is now sought. On balance, the terms of the consent decree establish that plaintiffs prevailed on\nthose questions resolved by the settlement. Gagne v. Maher, 594 F.2d 336 (2d Cir. 1979). Likewise, plaintiffs\nprevailed in the December 20, 1977 stipulation ending the law library litigation. And the injunction issued against\nthe Huntingdon cells of course made plaintiff class the prevailing party in that pocket of this suit. Mr. Levine, then,\nis statutorily eligible for a \"reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\" of this action.\nSection 1988 leaves to the discretion of the district court the decision whether counsel to the prevailing party\nshould be awarded attorney's fees. The statute's animating presumption is that successful counsel should\n\"ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\" Senate\nReport No. 94-1011, 94th Cong. 2nd Sess., p. 4, U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, pp. 5908, 5912.\nDefendants suggest no special circumstances that would rebut the presumption of an award and I can conceive\nof none. Accordingly, recovery of counsel fees will be allowed.\nThe next step is to determine the \"reasonable\" attorney's fee to be awarded. The Third Circuit, in a series of\nthoughtful opinions, has pioneered a formula for computing an appropriate award. Lindy Brothers Builders of\nPhiladelphia v. American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corp., 540 F.2d 102 (3d Cir. 1976) (en banc) (Lindy II); \nLindy Brothers Builders of Philadelphia v. American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir.\n1973) (Lindy I); Merola v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 515 F.2d 165 (3d Cir. 1975); Hughes v. Repko, 578 F.2d 483 (3d\nCir. 1978). Concisely stated, the Lindy calculus requires first, determination of the number of hours reasonably\nspent on successful matters and second, determination of a reasonable hourly rate for counsel's time. Next, the\nhour and rate figures are multiplied to produce the much-ballyhooed \"lodestar\" amount. Finally, the lodestar\nnumber is adjusted, in the discretion of the court, to account for various factors, including especially the quality of\ncounsel's work and the contingent nature of the case.\nApplication of this several-fold operation is not automatic. Judgment necessarily intrudes at each seemingly-\nmechanical step. Further, each determination must be critically made and discussed. An unanalyzed calculation\nof the lodestar is unacceptable, Hughes v. Repko, 578 F.2d at 487, and any adjustment of that amount also must\nbe explained to the extent possible given the fundamentally ad hoc nature of such decisions. With this imperative\nof careful analysis in mind, I must now apply the Lindy Brothers family of cases to Mr. Levine's petition.\n1021  III.\n*1021\nMr. Levine has moved for summary judgment on his motion for counsel fees. Defendants, citing a section of \nLindy I, Lindy Brothers Builders of Philadelphia v. American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F.2d at\n169, insist that summary judgment is a forbidden procedure in a fee petition case. An evidentiary hearing, they\nargue, is a categorical prerequisite to a § 1988 award. Because only oral argument00not an evidentiary\n97\nhearing00has been held here, defendants say the case is not ripe for decision. I do not agree that attorney's fee\n97\nissues are beyond the scope of F.R.Civ.P. 56.\nLindy I does not mandate an evidentiary hearing in all cases. The Lindy language in which defendants divine an\nexemption from Rule 56 is the following passage:\n\"[O]pposing interests should be afforded a hearing to provide an evidentiary basis for resolution of \ndisputed factual matters . . .\" 487 F.2d at 169 (emphasis supplied).\nThe import of this statement could not be more plain. An evidentiary hearing is required when material facts are\ndisputed. Necessarily, by implication, an evidentiary hearing is not required when the material facts are not in\ndispute. This of course is unassailable; the purpose of an evidentiary hearing being to find facts, none is needed\n\nwhen no facts are disputed. Neither Lindy nor logic precludes summary disposition of an attorney's fee petition\nwhere the facts to which the judge must apply his expertise and experience are uncontested.\nFurther, I find nothing peculiar in the nature of a fee petition that precludes use of a summary procedure. As\ndefendants themselves have stated, \"[a] motion for attorneys' fees [is] like any other claim for a money judgment\n. . ..\" Defendants' Memo in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Former Counsel's Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and\nCosts at 2. Claims for a money judgment are daily subjected to summary disposition and there is no reason why\nan attorney's fee petition, a species of the money judgment genus, should always be immune from that fate.\nLastly, \"Rule 56 makes the [summary] procedure available in all actions subject to the Rules . . .\" 6 Moore's\nFederal Practice ¶ 56.02[1] at 56-25 (2nd ed.). Certainly § 1988 suits are subject to the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Therefore, the terms of Rule 56 apply and the petition may be treated summarily if \"there is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and . . the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" As\nconcluded in II above, Mr. Levine is entitled to some recovery. I must thus determine here whether a genuine\nissue is raised as to any of the facts material to the Lindy analysis. If none is presented, then the suit is ripe for\njudgment.\nIV.\nThe first determination required by the Lindy analysis is the number of hours reasonably spent on successful\nissues. In his affidavit, Mr. Levine lists 43 items of time, totalling 229.75 hours, spent negotiating the consent\ndecree and litigating the law library and solitary confinement questions. Defendants do not contest this\naccounting of hours. Defendants' Hearing Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Former Counsel's Petition for\nAttorneys' Fees at 1. There is, then, no genuine issue of fact as to the number of hours reasonably supportive of\nthose efforts for which Mr. Levine is entitled to compensation. Rule 56 permits disposition of this question without\nan evidentiary hearing.\nHowever, deciding that further evidence is unnecessary to determine the number of hours does not end the\nmatter. Defendants' acceptance of Mr. Levine's requested time means only that there is no dispute as to \"the\nfacts to be weighed in light of the judge's expertise,\" Lindy Brothers Builders of Philadelphia v. American Radiator\nand Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F.2d at 169, not that I may accept petitioner's hours without independent\nscrutiny for reasonableness. Chief Judge Seitz has recently written that \"Lindy II and Merola II require the district\n1022 court to determine . . *1022 whether it was reasonably necessary to spend that number of hours in order to\nperform the legal services for which compensation is sought.\" Hughes v. Repko, 578 F.2d at 487. I turn now to\nthat determination.\nMr. Levine entered his appearance in Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp on December 8, 1971. In ¶ 3 of his\naffidavit, counsel states that he \"expended in excess of three hours in connection with the litigation\" before the\ndate of his appearance. In his proposed findings of fact, however, Mr. Levine neither lists these three hours nor\noffers a reasonable hourly fee for his 1971 services. Because the 1971 hours are few, were logged before formal\nappearance and, most important, appear to have been abandoned by petitioner, I will exclude these three hours\nfrom the amount of time for which Mr. Levine will be compensated.\nItems (1)-(4) of ¶ 3 of Mr. Levine's affidavit state 19 hours of time spent in 1972 on successfully pressed issues.\nOnly one of these items is controversial: 10 hours for an October 18, 1972 trip to the Commonwealth's\nCorrectional Institution at Dallas, Pennsylvania. Defendants, acknowledging that the hours were indeed spent,\nargue that travel time must be discounted and cite for that position Prandini v. National Tea Co., 557 F.2d 1015,\n1019-1020 (3d Cir. 1977) and Norwood v. Harrison, 410 F.Supp. 133, 142 n.10 (N.D.Miss.1976). I do not agree\nthat Prandini holds that the hours here spent travelling, if reasonable, cannot be included fully in the award of\nattorney's fees.\nDefendants' Prandini argument is that \"non-professional\" matters such as driving are not totally compensable.\nTheir use of the adjective \"non-professional\" indicates that the following statement from Prandini is that on which\nthey base their citation:\n\n\"[H]ours spent on purely clerical matters, easily delegable to non-professional assistants, should\nnot be valued at legal service rates.\" 557 F.2d at 1020 (note omitted) (emphasis supplied).\nThis holding does not support defendants' conclusion. \"Purely clerical matters, easily delegable to non-\nprofessional assistants,\" are not fully included in a fee award because these tasks need not be performed by\ncounsel. To allow undiluted compensation for an attorney's time spent on such work would be inequitable where,\nin the Third Circuit's phrase, \"non-professional assistants\" can do the work at a lesser expense.\nTime spent driving from Philadelphia to Dallas, Pennsylvania, is significantly different. Counsel could not delegate\nto others the task of travelling to interview a plaintiff. Although Mr. Levine need not actually have driven the car,\nhe obviously had to be present. Further, because not chauffeured in a limousine, Mr. Levine's necessary\npresence precluded him from accomplishing any billable legal work during the trip. This travel time, then, unlike\nthe clerical work in Prandini, could not have been performed at a lesser expense; further, the trip cost counsel the\nfees that he could have earned during the hours spent on the road. The impossibility of assigning the task\ndistinguishes Prandini and the lost opportunity for other work convinces me that Mr. Levine's 10 hours00a\n97\nreasonable time for the lengthy drive00should be fully included here.\n97\nDefendants' citation of Norwood v. Harrison, in which the district court disallowed 37 hours spent travelling to\ndepositions, is unpersuasive. First, I am of course not bound by a Northern District of Mississippi decision. And\nsecond, the ten words devoted to this issue in Norwood are hardly compelling. Accordingly, Mr. Levine's request\nfor 19 hours of fees in 1972 is approved as reasonable.\nItems (5)-(10) of ¶ 3 of the affidavit list 12.5 hours spent on these matters in 1973. I have reviewed each item and\nfind that these times are perfectly reasonable.\nThe figures for 1974 demand discussion. Items (11)-(35) state 167.75 hours of work, 58.25 hours of the\ntotal00items (11)-(17), (19)-(23), (33)-(35)00were spent on issues that were resolved without litigation by the\n97 97\n1023 consent decree. Based on my familiarity *1023 with the arduous drafting of that decree, I conclude that the 58.25\nhours claimed were reasonably supportive of the final settlement and should be compensated.\n109.5 of the 1974 hours00items (18), (24)-(32)00were spent on the issues actually litigated; the isolation cells at\n97 97\nDallas, Graterford, Huntingdon and Muncy and the adequacy of the prison law libraries. Most of these hours were\nspent pressing the Eighth Amendment claim. Mr. Levine tried that issue before me in 1974 and ultimately\nsucceeded in closing the challenged Huntingdon units. Use of the Dallas, Graterford and Muncy cells was not\nenjoined.\nBecause plaintiff class prevailed on only one of the four cruel and unusual punishment claims, Mr. Levine cannot\nbe compensated for all 109.5 litigation-related hours unless that entire time was reasonably supportive of the\nHuntingdon victory. Mr. Levine does not make that suggestion. Rather, recognizing that a reduction is needed,\ncounsel proposes decreasing the 109.5 hours by 75%. Presumably, this percentage corresponds to that fraction\nof the litigation that plaintiffs lost00i. e., 3 of 4 challenges to solitary cells. Defendants express no opinion on this\n97\nmethod of reduction.\nI think that Mr. Levine's proposal is reasonable on these facts, despite a recent Third Circuit case rejecting a\nsuperficially similar approach. In Hughes v. Repko, 578 F.2d at 486, Chief Judge Seitz admonished against an\nautomatic fractional reduction of the lodestar, concluding that such an approach \"does not have a rational basis\nto commend it\" because \"experience in litigation teaches that there is no necessary percentage relationship\nbetween the number of claims and contentions presented in a lawsuit and the lawyer time spent on each.\" I am\nboth in respectful agreement with and bound by the Hughes v. Repko rejection of an uncritical percentage\nreduction; nonetheless, that decision should not control my determination in this matter for one dispositive\nreason: the 75% decrease here is proposed by Mr. Levine.\nWhat made the Hughes v. Repko reduction objectionable was that it was applied by the district court without\nexamination and over petitioner's opposition. Application of the 75% discount in this case is at the suggestion of\nthe attorney seeking compensation. Admittedly, the reduction here has little more substantial a rational basis to\ncommend it than the percentage rejected in Hughes v. Repko. I am persuaded, however, that where petitioning\n\ncounsel proposes a fractional decrease, based on the number of successful issues, and opposing counsel by\nsilence acquiesces, the reduction may be accepted. To require that this proposal be rejected, and that I\nindependently determine what portion of the 109.5 hours reasonably supported the Huntingdon success, would\nbe to ignore the practical bearings of this case in vain pursuit of a theoretical consistency that trial court realities\ndo not allow.\nI thus will reduce the 109.5 hours to 27.5. These hours, added to the 58.25 approved above, give Mr. Levine a\n1974 total of 85.75 compensable hours.\nItems (36)-(41) of ¶ 3 of Mr. Levine's affidavit list 11 hours of time spent on prevailing issues in 1975. These\nclaims are reasonable.\nItem (42) requests compensation for 10 hours of \"time spent at conferences with the court and other counsel for\nwhich time sheets were not kept over the period 1972-1975.\" In his proposed findings of fact, Mr. Levine includes\nthis time in his 1975 hours and implicitly asks that he be paid a 1975 hourly rate for these conferences.\nI will allow compensation for these 10 hours, but not at a 1975 rate. Mr. Levine's failure to keep an accurate\nrecord of these conferences is troublesome. Ordinarily, unsubstantiated claims such as these 10 hours would not\nbe tolerated. I am willing, though, to make an exception here because I know from nearly nine years of\nexperience with this action that Mr. Levine's claims are conservatively stated and that during the four years for\n1024 which he seeks compensation Mr. Levine attended at least *1024 10 hours of conferences that are not\nspecifically itemized in his affidavit. The time requested is therefore reasonable.\nHowever, in his proposed findings of fact, Mr. Levine seeks compensation for these 10 hours at a 1975 rate. This\nI cannot approve. Because the hours were logged over a four-year period, compensation must be apportioned\nover that time. Apportionment accomplishes, to the inexact extent possible here, the aim of compensating\ncounsel at a rate current when the time was spent, rather than at the requested 1975 rate, a fee higher than\nthose prevailing in the 1972-1974 period during which many of these 10 hours of conferences were logged.\nAccordingly 2.5 hours should be added to each of the 1972-1975 yearly totals.\nThis addition brings the approved totals to the following sums: 1972-21.5; 1973-15; 1974-88.25; 1975-13.5.\nFinally, Mr. Levine's affidavit states 7.5 hours spent in late 1978 on preparation of his fee petition. No time is listed\nfor 1979, although I am aware of at least several hours of work spent on the fee issue this year. The 7.5 1978\nhours are reasonable and will be compensated.\nV.\nThe second determination required by the Lindy analysis is the reasonable hourly rate at which the reasonable\nhours determined above are to be compensated. Here again I find no genuine dispute of fact preclusive of\napplication, without an evidentiary hearing, of my experience and expertise on the matter of reasonable fees.\nAppended to Mr. Levine's motion for summary judgment is an affidavit from Peter Hearn, stating a reasonable\nhourly fee for Mr. Levine's work on the Imprisoned Citizens Union case. Mr. Hearn, a respected Philadelphia\nlitigator with considerable experience in civil rights suits, concluded in ¶ 4 of his affidavit that \"[i]n the years 1972\nthrough 1978, attorneys whose qualifications and reputations within their own field were equal to that of Mr.\nLevine's in the civil rights field commanded hourly rates from approximately $85 in 1972 to approximately $125 in\n1978.\" Based on Mr. Hearn's statement, Mr. Levine requests in his proposed findings of fact compensation at the\nfollowing rates: 1972-$85; 1973-$92; 1974-$97; 1975-$105; 1978-$125.\nDefendants offer no counter-affidavit on this issue of a reasonable hourly rate. Two reasons are advanced for this\nfailure to rebut on the record Mr. Levine's proof of a reasonable fee. First, defendants say, an evidentiary hearing\nis a categorical prerequisite to an award of attorneys fees and it is therefore unnecessary to create a genuine\nissue of fact by counter-affidavit to avoid summary disposition. This position was rejected in III above. Had\ndefendants timely urged this argument in answer to Mr. Levine's motion for summary judgment, fairness perhaps\nwould require that they be given an opportunity now to counter the Hearn affidavit. However, the first response to\n\ncounsel's March 1 motion for summary judgment came at the April 20 oral argument, seven weeks after the\nmotion was filed. The tardiness of defendants' answer mitigates any potential inequity in summarily treating Mr.\nLevine's motion. Cf. Blackburn v. Prudential Lines, Inc., 454 F.Supp. 1302, 1306 (E.D.Pa.1978) (affidavit not filed\nuntil argument untimely and not considered). Defendants' second reason for not challenging Mr. Hearn's\nconclusion further removes any concern that counter-affidavits should now be allowed.\nDefendants say that the Hearn affidavit was not countered because that statement is addressed to a theory of\nsetting a reasonable hourly fee inapplicable in this suit. Mr. Hearn's affidavit proceeds under the theory of \nRodriguez v. Taylor, 569 F.2d 1231, 1248 (3d Cir. 1977),cert. denied436 U.S. 913, 98 S.Ct. 2254, 56 L.Ed.2d\n414 (1978), that for an attorney whose practice does not involve a normal hourly billing rate, the \"appropriate\nreference . . . [is] comparable salaries earned by private attorneys with similar experience and expertise in\n1025 equivalent litigation.\" This approach, defendants now contend, is improper because, they say, Mr. Levine was in \n*1025 private practice during the period for which he now seeks compensation and his own hourly rate should\ntherefore be determinable and dispositive.\nDefendants' contention that Rodriguez is inapposite here was first advanced at the April 20 oral argument on Mr.\nLevine's March 1 motion. Before that time, defendants had at least twice urged the applicability of Rodriguez to\nthis suit, although no affidavit probative of applicable fees was filed. Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to\nPlaintiffs' Former Counsel's Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs (filed December 11, 1978);\nDefendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment (dated February 23, 1979). The April\n20 urging of the inapplicability of Rodriguez was devoid of any reference to supporting evidence. Indeed, not a\nsingle question about hourly rates was asked of Mr. Levine at his April 12, 1979 deposition, and the handful of\ninquiries about his private practice from 1972-1975 turned up nothing helpful to defendants' position.\nI cannot accept the argument that Mr. Levine's reasonable hourly rate can be determined by reference to his\nactual practice during the period relevant here. Mr. Levine stated at oral argument that from 1972-1975 his\ncompensation varied from $15 per hour for non-homicide criminal appointments to $1500 per hour for work on a\ngrand jury appearance. The great preponderance of his cases then, as now, were civil rights suits taken on a\ncontingent fee basis and are thus useless in determining his actual hourly rate. Having failed even to touch upon\nthe subject in Mr. Levine's deposition, defendants cannot offer an iota of proof of an actual hourly rate from\n1972-1975 and their position must be rejected.\nBy ultimately urging the inapplicability of Rodriguez, defendants abandoned the theory of fees on which the\nHearn affidavit rests. This abandonment, coupled with the above-discussed lateness of any response to Mr.\nLevine's motion for summary judgment, compels a negative answer to the question whether fairness requires that\ncounter-affidavits now be allowed. Defendants had six weeks to challenge the facts in Mr. Levine's motion for\nsummary judgment and chose instead to urge two losing legal theories. I will now hold them to that choice and\nwill determine a reasonable hourly fee based on Mr. Hearn's affidavit alone.\nThe $85 hourly fee that Mr. Hearn concludes is reasonable compensation for Mr. Levine's 1972 services and the\n$125 figure for 1978 work, while facially reasonable, upon analysis seem unreasonably high. In 1972, Mr. Levine\nwas a 30-year old attorney, only 5 years out of law school. At the suggested rate of $85 an hour, Mr. Levine would\nhave earned $170,000 for a 40 hour, 50 week work year. Compensation of this magnitude is excessive for a\nlawyer who in 1972 had been practicing less than 5 years. My experience with Philadelphia legal fees convinces\nme that a 1972 hourly rate of $50 is reasonable. This hourly fee would have earned for Mr. Levine $100,000 for a\n40 hour, 50 week work year. Of this $100,000 amount, Mr. Levine would have netted approximately $45,000,\ngiven his estimated overhead costs of 55% of gross revenues. $45,000 a year in 1972 was generous but fair\ncompensation for services of the high quality rendered by Mr. Levine in this suit.\nAccordingly, counsel will be compensated at the following hourly rates: 1972-$50; 1973-$57; 1974-$62; 1975-\n$70; 1978-$90. The yearly increases are taken from petitioner's proposed findings of fact and are reasonable.\nAlthough many attorney's fees cases set only an average rate for the entire period of recovery, I prefer to use a\nseparate rate for each year, that method being the more exact scheme of compensation.\nMultiplying the approved hours by the reasonable rates and adding those products yields Mr. Levine's lodestar:\n\n1972     -    $1075.00\n1973     -      855.00\n1974     -     5471.50\n1975     -      945.00\n1978     -      675.00\n              _________\n                 TOTAL      $9021.50\n1026  VI.\n*1026\nThe final determination required by Lindy is whether the lodestar amount should be adjusted to account for\nexceptional circumstances. Foremost among the numerous factors that ought to be considered in deciding\nwhether adjustment is merited are the contingent nature of the case and the quality of counsel's work. Although\nadjustment, if any, is usually upward, where warranted by extraordinary reasons the lodestar amount may be\nreduced. Hughes v. Repko, 578 F.2d at 491 (Garth, J., concurring).\nDefendants urge that three considerations merit a 50% reduction of Mr. Levine's $9021.50 basic award. First,\ndefendants say, the litigation conducted by Mr. Levine was simple, consisting mostly, in his own words, of \"people\ngetting up on the witness stand and describing what the circumstances were.\" Second, because the closed cells\nwere reopened five months later, the success was short-lived. And third, an unreduced recovery here would\nconstitute an impermissible windfall to Mr. Levine.\nI find these arguments unpersuasive. The Eighth Amendment issues litigated here were not easy. Of course the\ntrial consisted largely of putting on witnesses. Most trials consist mostly of precisely that. To reduce an attorney's\nfee because he did no more than successfully elicit testimony would be substantially to repeal § 1988. Further,\nMr. Levine here did more than simply present witnesses00if indeed such a task can be said to be simple. To\n97\nprevail on the Huntingdon issue, Mr. Levine had to discern in the impressionistic swamp of cruel and unusual\npunishment precedents identifiable standards and present them coherently and tellingly. This was not so easy as\ndefendants now remember and no reduction is justified on grounds of simplicity of issues.\nNor is a reduction warranted because Mr. Levine's success was short-lived. The July 1978 injunction closing the\nHuntingdon isolation cells was suspended in November 1978 because conditions in those units had improved\nenough to erase the stamp of unconstitutionality. This improvement, rather than detracting from plaintiffs'\nsuccess, confirmed the importance of Mr. Levine's work. It would be absurd to reduce the award simply because\ndefendants cured the Eighth Amendment defects after losing the litigation.\nLastly, defendants' fear that unreduced recovery here would be an unallowable windfall is unfounded. In one\nsense, any fee award is a windfall for Mr. Levine because he began work on this action at a time when it was\nwidely thought that the Eleventh Amendment barred recovery of attorney's fees in a case, like this, where\nrecovery was sought from a state. But that is not the sort of windfall award with which defendants are concerned.\nRecovery by a private attorney general, which Mr. Levine was here, \"so lucrative as to ridicule the public attorney\ngeneral,\" Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 719 (5th Cir. 1974), is what worries them. I do\nnot find the undiminished lodestar so spectacular as to mock the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, who\nhas of course defended this suit for seven years. The windfall fear, I think, is properly factored into the decision\nwhether to augment the lodestar amount, not into the decision whether to reduce it. No reduction is justified by\nthis concern because the basic award is, by definition and as determined in IV and V above, not overly-lucrative\nbut rather a reasonable recovery.\nDenying defendants' proposed reduction of the lodestar amount does not of course compel granting Mr. Levine's\nurged increase of the basic recovery. Mr. Levine endeavors to augment his award by 50%, 25% based on the\ncontingent nature of the case and 25% based on the quality of work performed here. I do not accept Mr. Levine's\nproposed increase.\n\nEvery case in which attorney's fees are sought involves the possibility that counsel will not prevail and therefore\nwill not be paid. This is because a case in which counsel is compensated regardless of success is not the proper\n1027 subject of a fee petition. *1027 The contingency factor, then, because inherent in every suit for attorney's fees,\ncannot always justify an increase of the lodestar amount, unless such an adjustment is to be automatic. The \nLindy series of cases does not envision this categorical increase. Only when the contingency involved in a\nparticular case is somehow exceptional should the basic recovery be supplemented.\nThe contingent nature of this action is not, I think, unusual enough to warrant an increase. Success here, albeit\nuncertain, was not so remote a likelihood that counsel deserves to be compensated simply for taking the case.\nFor over a decade, litigation of this sort has not been a stranger in the federal courts and the contingencies\ninvolved in bringing such a suit are, to a great extent, foreseeable and not extraordinary. What was exceptional\nhere was counsel's above-mentioned willingness to take the case at a time when it was unsettled whether the\nEleventh Amendment barred recovery of attorney's fees. I will return to this risk in the discussion below.\nMr. Levine's argument that a 25% increase is justified by the high quality of his work is, I think redundant. The\nliberal hourly rates approved in V above assume services of the highest quality. Only the rarest sort of work\nwould merit a 25% supplement to the ample lodestar here. Mr. Levine's services, although excellent, were not so\ndistinguished as to justify his requested increase.\nI do think, however, that Mr. Levine deserves some upward adjustment of his basic recovery. Counsel cites in\nsupport of his argument for an increase the \"tens of thousands\" of benefited class members, the importance of\nthe rights vindicated and the public interest implicated in this suit. Judge Garth, concurring in Hughes v. Repko,\nnoted that these considerations are proper ones:\n\"[I]n an award under the Civil Rights Act, . . . the district court might consider, inter alia: the\nimportance of the constitutional right . . . which has been vindicated; the number of citizens who\nhave been benefited or whose rights have been vindicated [and] the extent to which the public\ninterest has been served.\" 578 F.2d at 492 n.5.\nI believe that the public interest element justifies a supplement here.\nBecause plaintiff class consisted of all inmates present and future, of the Commonwealth's prison system, the\nnumber of persons who have benefited from Mr. Levine's efforts in this action is large. For this reason alone, an\nincrease of the basic amount is perhaps justified under Third Circuit case law. I do not, however, much rely on\nthat numerical consideration in this suit because the significance of constitutional litigation does not always\ncorrespond to the number of successful plaintiffs.\nI am likewise not much helped here by considering the importance of the rights involved. The several interests\nvindicated by the consent decree, the law library stipulation and the solitary confinement litigation are\nunmistakably fundamental ones; indeed, they are as essential to the purpose and limits of our social contract as\nany embodied in the Constitution. On the other hand, I am troubled by the possibility, implicit in Judge Garth's \nHughes v. Repko note, that I may find the rights protected here to be more fundamental than those involved in\nother constitutional cases. The precious rights guaranteed by the Constitution are not ranked. To distinguish\namong petitions for counsel fees based on the importance of the interests involved seems to me, in constitutional\ncases at least, to invite the creation of a hierarchy of rights00a development that wisely has been avoided for\n97\nnearly two centuries.\nWhat convinces me that an increase in the basic recovery is appropriate here is neither the number of plaintiffs\ninvolved nor the importance of the rights vindicated, but rather the public interest that has been furthered by this\naction. The often-stated purpose of § 1988 is to advance the public interest in affording victims of civil rights\n1028 violations effective access to the judicial process. House of Representatives *1028 Report No. 94-1558, 94th\nCong. 2nd Sess. p. 1 (1976); Senate Report No. 94-1011, 94th Cong. 2nd Sess. p. 2 (1976). This announced\ninterest in providing access to the federal courts was significantly furthered by Mr. Levine's work.\nA class action on behalf of all present and future prisoners in a state penal system is neither a glamorous nor a\npopular case. Plaintiffs in a suit like this are, within frequent exceptions, financially unable to retain private\n\ncounsel on any other than a contingent fee basis and where, as here, injunctive relief is the essential intention of\nthe suit, even a contingency arrangement is difficult. Further, for obvious reasons, representing clients confined in\ndistant prisons presents frustrating logistic and legal difficulties. These factors and others convince me that when\nMr. Levine took this case seven years ago he gave an experienced and persuasive voice to a wronged class that\notherwise may have gone unheard. Moreover, when Mr. Levine began work on this case, the possibility of\ncompensation from the Commonwealth was clouded by Eleventh Amendment concerns. This obstacle to\nretention of private counsel by plaintiffs, coupled with those just cited, underscores the contribution made by Mr.\nLevine to the Congressional goal of effectively opening the courts to civil rights plaintiffs.\nThe important public interest furthered by Mr. Levine's services should not be lightly regarded. Granted, no\npalpable benefit is bestowed on the Republic by the closing of three isolation cells in central Pennsylvania or by\nthe availability to state prisoners in Philadelphia of the Federal Supplement. Nonetheless, the significance,\nindeed the necessity of these successes is profound.\nThe greatness of a society is not measured by the treatment accorded its powerful and affluent. Throughout\nhistory, these classes have fared well in humane and cruel cultures alike. Fair treatment of the vulnerable among\nits number is what makes a society great. When a suit such as this is successfully brought, our society advances\nan imperceptible but real distance towards the constitutional promise of a more perfect union. As Justice Field\nwrote exactly a century ago in the prisoners' rights case of Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, 12 F.Cas. 252, 256 (CCD\nCal.1879) (citation omitted):\n\"It is certainly something in which a citizen of the United States may feel a generous pride that the\ngovernment of his country extends protection to all persons within its jurisdiction; and that every\nblow aimed at any of them, however humble, come from what quarter it may, is `caught upon the\nbroad shield of our blessed Constitution and our equal laws.'\"\nMr. Levine's work here has confirmed the generous pride of which Justice Field eloquently spoke. I find that his\ncontribution justifies a 15% supplement to the basic recovery determined above. I note that some uncertainty has\nrecently been expressed whether adjustment of the lodestar is to be worked by a multiple, a percentage or a\nfixed dollar amount. AAMCO Automated Transmissions, Inc. v. Tayloe, 82 F.R.D. 405, 416 (E.D.Pa. 1979). The\n15% addition here is not meant to express an opinion on this question. I use a percentage increase only because\nI have used that method without controversy in the past. See, e. g., In re Penn Central Securities Litigation, 416\nF.Supp. 907, 932 (E.D.Pa. 1976). Adding 15%, $1353.25, to the basic recovery, $9021.50, gives Mr. Levine a\ntotal of $10,374.75.\nFinally, counsel asks compensation for costs in the amount of $630.59. Paragraph 5 of Mr. Levine's affidavit lists\nthe requested cost items. I find them reasonable and will order full recovery.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Defendants,  their  agents  and employees,  acting  In  concert  and  under  color  of\nU*  as  state  officers,  have conspired  aM  agreed  amongst  themselves  to  violate  the  civil  and\nhuman rights  of  the  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  they  represent  by causing  them to  be  subjected\n\"to grievous  bodily  harm,  barbaricaTly  cruel  and  unusual  punishment,  end  violations  of  their\nrights  under  the  First,  Fifth,  Sixth,  Eighth,  Ninth,  and  Fourteenth  amendments  to  the  United\nStates  Constitution,  as  more  fully  set  forth  1n the  following  statement  of  facts.\n21.  The  State  Correctional  Institutions  of  the  Comonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  are\nadministered  by  the  Bureau  of  Corrections  which  is  a sub-division  of  the  Department  of\nJustice.\n22.  A majority  of  the  adult  prisoners  in  the  state  who are  serving  sentences  of  two\nyears  or wore are  housed  in  the  State  Correctional  Institutions  at  Graterford,  Dallas, Huncy\nHuntingdon,  Roctv^ew,  and  Pittsburgh.\n23.  Each State  Correctional  Institution  is  under  the  supervision  of  a  SuperiMender\nand a Deputy  Superintendent  who are  responsible  for  the  daily  operation  of  the  institution\nand  for  supervising  and  directing  the  activities  of  the  employees  of  the  Institution\n-5-\n~wn\n\nr\ning  custodial  personnel,  treatment  staff,  and nedical  and religious  stiff.\n24.  Judges  in  Pennsylvania  nay not  sentence ma'e persons  to a particular  state\ncorrectional  Institution.  The place  of  Incarceration  of  a rale  person  sentenced  to a  state\ncorrectional  institution  1s decided  according  to  regulations  promulgated  by the Bureau of\nCorrections.  A male  prisoner  is  subject  to  transfer,  without  notice,  from  one state  correc-\ntional  institution  to  sny other,  including  Muncy,  at  any time  during  the  service  of  his sen-\ntence  as more  fully  set  forth  below.  Female  prisoners  are presently  housed  only  at  the\nState  Correctional  Institution  at  Muncy and are not subject  to  such  transfers.\n25.  Plaintiffs  are  Incarcerated  1n walled,  fortress-like  institutions  where  they\nspend  most  of  their  tine  working  at  menial  and meaningless  Jobs,  such  as,  keeping  the  grouncs\nclean,  (\"lawn-detail\"),  mopping  the floor  of  the  cetlblock,  (\"blocfc-detail\"),  or  running\nerrands  for the guards,  (\"range-runner*),  for an average salary  of  &pproximite)y fifty  cents\nper day.\n26.  Defendants  fall  to furnish  Plaintiffs  with many of the necessities  for  maintain-\ning  personal  hygiene,  such as deodorant,  shampoo, razor  blades,  razors,  toothbrushes and\ntoothpaste;  and Plaintiffs  are forced  to purchase  these  Items  from  the prison  commissary\nout  of their  meagre wages.\nZ7. Prisoners  in State  Correctional  Institutions  may be housed witWn  the  Institutioi\neither  in the general  population  or in some type of  solitary  confinement,  known  officially\nas:\"admin1strat1ve  segregation\",  \"punitive  segregation\",  or  \"seclusion.\"\n28.  Plaintiffs  have been and continue  to be placed  in solitary  conMnenent  for\nperiods  of as long as seven yezrs,  under  Illegal  and unconstitutional  conditions,  for an\ninfraction  of one of  the so-called  prison  rules,  or because the prison administration  wishes\nto  separate  them from  the general  poDulation.\n29.  Plaintiffs  receive  no notice  of  the rules  and regulations  which govern  their\nconduct  1n prison.\n30.  Plaintiffs  receive  no notice  of  what constitutes  an infraction  of such  rules\nand  regulations.\n31.  Plaintiffs  receive  no notice  of which  punishments  are permitted  to be imposed\nfor  Infractions  of  such  rules  and regulations.\n-6-\n\n32.  There is  no existing  comprehensive codification  of  the rules  and regulations\ngoverning  the  administration  of  the various  state  correctional  institutions,  nor  is  there\na comprehensive  codification  of  the rules  and regulations  governing  the conduct of  the\nPlaintiffs  in  prison.\n33.  Defendants  and their  agents on the custodial  staffs  of  the institutions,  actir.c\nin disregard of,  or without  any rules  and regulations  governing  the conduct  of  Plaintiffs,\nare free  to,  and do in  fact,  make daily  ad hoc decisions  regarding what  is,  and is  not, an\nInfraction  of  so-called prison  regulations, and arbitrarily  and capricious\"/  punish  Plaintiff;\nfor  violating  thereof.\n34.  Plaintiffs  who are charged with  such infractions  are  itrcnediately  placed  In  soli-\ntary  confinement without  notice  and without  a hearing.\n35.  Plaintiffs  who have been so confined may remain 1n solitary  confinement without\ntver  being given a hearing, or  1f  granted a hearing, such hearing may be delayed by as much\nas one to  three weeks.\n36.  Plaintiffs  who have been placed in  solitary  confinement may be given a hearing\nbefore a three iwnber  panel consisting of  the Superintendent,  the Deputy Superintendent, end\nt  senior  member of  the custodial  or treatment staff.  Such panel  1s called  a behavior  clinic.\nThe purpose of  the hearing  is  to  decide If  an Infraction has been cormitted  and to impose\npunishment,  (i.e.,  some type  of  solitary  confinement.)\n37.  There are no adequate regulations  governing  the conduct of  the behavior  clinic.\nhearings,  and no regulations  governing the type or-length  of  punishment  that  nay be imposed\nfor  a particular  Infraction.\n38. At  the hearing  before  the behavior  clinic  the  Plaintiffs:\na)  receive  no notice  of  the charges against  them;\nb)  are not  permitted any kind of  representation;\nc)  are not  permitted  to examine witnesses  or  present witnesses on\ntheir  own behalf;\nd)  are not  entitled  to an Impartial  tribunal;\ne)  are not  permitted  to have i  record made of  the  proceedings;\n  f)  are not  advised of the maximum length of  the punishment imposed;\n:\n'  g)  are not permitted  to confront  the witnesses  against  then.\n39.  There is  nD appeal from action of  the behavior  clinic.\n40.Plaintiffs  found suilty  of  rules  infractions  are placed  in  solitary  confinement  f'\n-7-\n\nan unlimited  duration  subject  to  the whir  of  the Defendants  and their  agents.\nPlaintiffs  so confined ire  entitled  to  have their  status  reviewed by the bahavicr\nclinic  from time to  time,  however,  such review  is meaningless  1n that:\na)  Plaintiffs  are not afforded  a personal  appearance  be'ore\nthe reviewing  body;\nb)  there are no rules  and regulations  governing  the review\nprocedures;\nc)  the  review procedure  is  as cor^'etely  lacking  in due process\nas the original  hearing;\n•  41. Plaintiffs  placed in solitary  confinement are subjected  to  the  less  cr\nlimitation  of  one or more of  the following:\na)  human contact;\nb)mail  delivery,  sometimes delayed until  the Plaintiff  1s\nreleased from solitary  confinement;\nc)  access to attorneys  and Courts - with  the exception of\npending actions;\nd) access to government  officials;\ne) access to commissary Hems;\nf)  access to  physical  exercise, both Indoors and ourdoors;\ng) access  to showers and other  necessities  of  personal\nhygiene;\nh) access  to  leca)  materials;\ni)  access  to reading natter  of  any  kind;\nj)  medical  attention;\nk)  loss  of  job,  thus resulting  In loss of  seniority  and pay.\n42.  Defendants maintain certain areas within  the  institutions  which are\nreserved for  prisoners who are placed  in  solitary  confinement.  These areas  <j-;^f*r\nsignificantly  in  their  physical  attributes  from the cells  1n which those prisoners  in\nthe general  population are housed.  For each type of  solitary  confinement  the'e  is a\ndifferent  type of cell  and a different  set of  lost  privileges,  growing more confininc\nand onerous as you progress from administrative  segregation to seclusion.\n43.  Plaintiffs  who are placed in  solitary  confinement  because of  so-called  rult\ninfractions.may  be placed in  any one of  three degrees of  solitary  confinement,at  the v\n-8-\n\nand the caprice of  the defendants arid their  agents.\nAt.  P1*intiffs  who have been placed in solitary  confinement because of  such Infrac-\ntions,  are subject  to transfer  from one degree of solitary  confinement to another, at the\narbitrary  whim and caprice of  the defendants and their  agents without  the opportunity  to\nbe  heard.\nAS. The worst  degree  of  solitary  confinement  is  that  of  seclusion.  Plaintiffs\nconfined  1n seclusion  are  placed  In  dungeon-like  cells  such as the  \"Sweat  Bcxes\"  at  CalUs,\nthe  'Glass  Cage\"  at  Huntingdon,  Clinton  Cottage at M.uncy, \"Big Max\" at  Graterford,  and\n\"trie  Sole\"  at  Pittsburgh.  Plaintiffs  confined  1n seclusion,  in  addition  to  the  loss  of  the\nprivileges  enumerated  above,  further  suffer  from:\na)  confinement  1n filthy,  vermin-infested  subterranean  dungeons-\nb)  Tack of  ventilation;\nc)  lack  of  bedding;\nd)  lack  of  adequate  clothing\ne)  starvation  diets;\nfj.lack  of  adequate  sanitation  and means of  personal  hygiene,\ndue  to  being  placed  in cells  that  lack  a washbasin and water\nfaucet  and that  contain  plumbing  fixtures  that  can only be\ncontrolled by custodial  personnel  outside of  the  cell.\ng)  harrassnent  and assault  at the whim of custodial  nersornel\narmed with weapons or chemicals  such as mace; such chemicals\nare  used in such manner as not merely  to subdue  plaintiffs\nbut  to  Injure  then by, for'example,  spraying mace  directly\ninto  the mouth of a plaintiff  or directly  Into  his eyes  at close\nrange.\nh)  brutal  and unjustifiable  physical  assaults  by goon squads of\ncustodial  personnel  often for sadistic  purposes.\n1)  severe  limitations  on. physical  exercise-  in sorr.e cases none\nat all.\nj)  complete  lack  of any light  source withfn the  cell;\nk)  total  Interruption  of educational  programs  such as,\n:  correspondence courses or vocational  training.\n46.  Plaintiffs  are further  subject  to arbitrary  ar.d capricious  punishment  by means\nof  being  transferred  from one correctional  Institution  to another  without  notice  and withoj,\ni  hearing.  There are no rules  and regulations  regarding  such transfers.  Demotions!  trans-\nfen  result  in the loss  of  privileges  gained  through  seniority,  such as job placement, end\n\nr\npay,  and are made without  any regard  for  disruption  and/or  teminttic-n  of  rehabi 1-; ut-ve\nprograms,  such as,  attendance  at  educational  institutions  and correspondence  courses.  SucL.\ntransfers  often  result  in  prejudicing  the rights  of  plaintiffs  who are scheduled for  parole\nhearings,  and result  in  a delay  of  such hearings..  De~:tional  transfers  often  involve a\nchange  in  status  fnyn general  population  to  solitary  cor.finerr.ent,  again without  any  notice\nor  hearing and totally  at  the  arbitrary  whim and caprice  of  the Defendants  and their  agents\nind  employees.\n47.  Defendants  use such devotional  transfers  to  harass  plaintiffs  by isoleflnc  frer\nfrom their  families  and attorneys and to  intimidate  and prevent  them fror  exe^cis^ng  their\nconstitutional  rights.\n45.  Plaintiffs  who are  transferred  temporarily  to  local  Jails  for  Court  appearances,\neither  as a result  of  pending charges,-or  as a result  of  having  filed  post-conviction  relie-\npetitions,  are subjected  to  permanent  loss of  seniority  with  the resultant  loss  of  oay and\nprivileges.\n49.  Defendants have refused  to  promulgate rules  governing demotions!  transfers, and\ncontinue  to  permit  their  agents  and employees to  use such transfers  to  harass  Plaintiffs\nand to  prevent  them from engaging  1n constitutionally  protected  activities.\n50.  Defendants  permit their  agents and employees to  read and censor  Plaintiffs'  out-\ngoing and incoming mail.  Including  correspondence  to  and from attorneys  and government\nofficials.  Although attorneys  may have confidential  communications  with  the  plaintiffs  by\nvisiting  them in  person at  the  prison, as the  institutions  are located, for  the msst  part,\nat  an inconvenient  distance  from places where Plaintiffs'  attorneys  maintain  the'r  offices\nthe denial  of  total  confidentiality  of  correspondence between attorney  and client  is  a g.-o-\ninterference  with  the  right  of  plaintiffs  to  have such confidential  corrr.unicatio-s  with th>\nattorneys.\n51.  Defendants  permit  their  agents  and employees  to  unreasonably  and arbitrarily  re:\ntrict  the reading material  available  to  the plaintiffs  and their  means of  obtaining  such\nmaterial.\n52.  Plaintiffs  are  required  to obtain  all  reading matter  directly  fror,  the  publishe\nwhich  1s an unreasonable  and arbitrary  requirement,  and places  an undue burden on their\nability  to obtain  reading material  In accordance with  their  wants and needs.\n-10-\n\n53.  Defendants  have arbitrarily  restricted  Plaintiffs  from receiving  the total  out-\nput of  my  publisher  whose single publication  they  find  unacceptable,  even though  the  par-\nticular  publication  requested  by Plaintiffs  is  within  the  bounds  proscribed  by Defendants'\nrules  and  regulations.\n54. Defendants  and their  agents  have continually  denied Plaintiffs  the right  to\nreceive  and read books, magazines, newspapers,  Instructional  materials,  public  documents,\nand other  reading  matter  of  great  Interest  and value  to  Plaintiffs,  Including  but  net  lirrit-\ned to:  The Catholic  Worker,  Daily  World, Muhmad Speaks, Pittsburgh  Fair  Witness,  PhiladelD*.-\nFree Press. Resist  Newsletter,  Penal  Digest,  Prisoners  Free Press, WIN, Liberated Guardian,\nMilitant,  and  other  political  newspapers and literature  of  general  circulation.\n55.  Such denials  have not  been based on, nor  have they  been 1n furtherance  of,  any\nobjectively  valid  criteria,  and have not  1n any way, been rationally  related  to  the goals\nof  the prison system as a whole, the  particular  prison  involved, or  the individual  prisoner,\nRather,  they  have been arbitrary,  discriminatory,  and based solely  on whim and caprice, as\nwell  as deliberately  repressive.\n56.  Plaintiffs  who have been denied access to  reading matter  have no means of aDp-\nealing  such action.\n57. Plaintiffs  who have been denied access to  reading natter  are not  informed of\nthe reason for  such denial.\n53. Defendants  fail  to  furnish  Plaintiffs  with  adequate  law libraries  necessary\nfor  the  exercise  of  Plaintiffs'  constitutional  rights;  and instead,  furnish  their\ninstitutions  solely  with  editions  of  Purdens  Pennsylvania  Statutes  Annotated, without\nup to  date pocket  parts.\n59.  Defendants  do~not  permit  plaintiffs  to  communicate by correspondence  or\nby personal  Interview  with  representatives  of  the  news media.\n60.  Defendants  refuse  to recognize  the dietary  needs of  Plaintiffs  whose  reli-\ngious  beliefs  prevent  then from eating  certain  foods,  and Defendants  deny said  Plain-\ntiffs  even minimal  dietary  requirements.  Plaintiffs  are  thereby  forced to  supplement\ntheir  diet  with  comissary  Items  purchased with  the'r  s*t;re  wages.\n-11-\n\n61.  Dependents  fail  to provide proper diet  and medication  to Plaintiffs  who\nhave, or  develop,  chronic  physical  ailments  requiring  dally  special  attention,  such\nAS ulcers  or  diabetes.\n62.  Defendants  fail  to  provide adequate medical  care  'or  Plaintiffs  ir,  that:\na)  treatment  is  unduly  delayed;\nb)  there  is  lack  os continuity  of  treatment,  (e.g.  medical  charts\nfail  to  follow  a prisoner, who has  been  operated  on from  hospital\nto  the  prison;\nc)  there  is  inadequate  follow-up,  even when there  has been\ntreatment;\n.  d} there  is  inadequate  access  to  treatment,  in  that  medical\npersonnel  are not  continuously  available  on a  twenty-four\nhour  basis;\ne)  there  1s no adequate medical  record  keeping,  records  are\npoorly  made up, by untrained  personnel,  and are lost when\na prisoner  Is  transferred  from one  Institution  to  another.\n•  f)  there  Is  totally  Inadequate  psychiatric  treatment  for\n•  .  Plaintiffs  suffering  from acute  psychosis.  Plaintiffs  so\nsuffering  are treated  with a combination  of  solitary  con-\n:  '  f-fnement  and drugs, which  1s inappropriate  treatment  for\nthat  condition.\n63.  Defendants  permit  their  agents  and employees  to arbitrarily  and  capriciously\nrequire  Plaintiffs  to  Ingest  tranqu1l1z1ng  drugs,  such as Thorazine,  and to  impose pun-\nishment upon Plaintiffs  who refuse  such medication.  The ingesticn  of  such drugs,. oft fir:\non a continual  daily  basis,  has, and will  continue  to  cause,  permanent mental  Imbalance\nin  Plafntiffs.\nSi.  Defendants  permit  inappropriate  treatment  to  be administered  tc  Plaintiffs,\nsuch as  the administration  of  placebos, which can and  have,  resulted  in  the  encou-eser.e-\nof  drug addiction  on the  part  of  Plaintiffs,  by making  them psychologically  dependent\non pill-taking.\n65.  Defendants  penrit  drugs  to  be given  to  Plaintiffs  in  forms whicr, cause  ther;\nto  lose  their  therapeutic  value,  such as,  by Insisting  that  they  be dissolved  in water\nbefors  being  Ingested.\n66. Defendants  permit  the  existence  of  conditions  1n their  institutions  which\ncreate  and foster  deviant  behavior,  by denying  to Plaintiffs  human contact,  contact\nwith  the opposite  sex,  adecuate  physical  exercise,  and adequate  environmental  space.\n-12-\n\nr\nfree\n67.  Defendants  fail  to  provide/prosthetic  devices  such es false  teeth and\nto  Plaintiffs  who require  them.  In order  to obtain  such devices,  free of  charge,  it\n1s necessary  for  Plaintiffs  to  apply  to  the Bureau of  Vocational  Rehabilitaticri.\n68. The Bureau of  Vocational  Rehabilitation,  acting  on behalf  of  the  Defendants,\nhas no established  standards  for  the granting  or  denial  of  sucn prosthetic  devir.es,\nend Plaintiffs  in  need of  them have been denied such devices  under  standards which are\narbitrary  or  capricious.\n69.  Defendants  have failed  to  insure  that  Plaintiffs'  medical  records  are  confi-\ndential,  and have allowed  then to  be examined witno-'t  Plaintiffs'  consent,  by persons\nwho are untrained,  unlicensed,  and unprivileged.\n70. Defendants,  although ultimately  responsible  for  the penal  system of  the\nCommonwealth of  Pennsylvania, have continued to  permit the existence of  such unconstitu-\ntional  conditions  as are described above.\n•  71. Because of  this  conduct on the part  of  the Defendants, Plaintiffs  are forced  to\nlive  8 daily  existence  1n a hostile  environment where they are completely  uncrotected\nfront  arbitrary  harassment  by Defendants'  employees and other  Inmates.\n72.  Such rules  and regulations  as have been promulgated by Defendants  for  the\nadministration  of  the penal  institutions  of  this  CommonweiHh have been promulgated\nwithout  any notice  to  Plaintiffs,  and without  any provision  to  insure  that  such  rules\nand regulations  will  be administered  properly,  correctly,  and in  the same manner\nthroughout  the  penal  system of  the Conroonwealth.\n73.  Defendants  continue  to confine  Plaintiffs  in  prisons  that  are control's;; by\nracist  prison officials  who deliberately  instigate  and provoke racial  tensions,  riots,\nand interracial  violence  between Inmates by reason of  the discriminatory  and  racist\npolicies  that  they  enforce.\n74.  Defendants  continue  to deny Plaintiffs  the rights  declared  in  the  \"Standard\nMinimum Rules For  the Treatment of  Prisoners And Related Recommendations'' of  the  United\nNations, even though such rights  were adopted by the Commonwealth of  Pe*r<yH*nia  bv\nOrder of  the Defendant, J.. Shane Creamer,  fn a memorandum dated October 4, 1971.\n75.  Plaintiffs  art  denied the right  to wear civilian  clothing  and are forced  to\nwear dr*b,  worn, jecond bind  clothing  that  is  Inadequate  to  keep Plaintiffs  warm in  win\n-13-\n\nr\nmonths, and which 1s deliberately designed to destroy Plaintiffs' self respect and\nIndividuality.\n76. Defendants force Plaintiffs to submit to \"strip searches\", at the arbitrary\nwhim and caprice of the custodial personnel.  During such searches, Plaintiffs are\nforced to strip nude, open their mouths, lift up their anrs, expose their genitals,\nshow the soles of their feet, and bend over at the waist so that custodial  personnel\ncan visually examine their posteriors. In addition, the custodial  personnel  assault\nPlaintiffs by putting their hands into their hairanc en their heads and bodies, unde--\nthe guise of searching for contraband.\n77. Defendants permit custodial  personnel to vandalize Plaintiffs' cells, a^d\ndestroy Plaintiffs' books, papers, and other property while Plaintiffs are absent fr~-\ntheir cells.  ,\n78. Defendants unreasonably restrict the number of visitors Plaintiffs may re-\nceive  while they are Incarcerated in State Correctional  Institutions.  Plaintiffs\nso confined are not permitted to recefve more than ten (10) visitors.\n79. Defendants continue to employ persons on the custodial and treatment  staffs\nof the Institutions who have and continue to, engage 1n sadistic practices and whose\npresence constitutes a continuing threat to Plaintiffs' safety.\n80. Defendants continue to operate a prison system which results in the daily\noppression and degradation of the Plaintiffs and the total denial of Plaintiffs' basic\nconstitutional and hur.an rights.\nCAUSE OF ACTION\nDisciplinary  Proceedings\n81. The actions of Defendants in failing to provide a comprehensive  code of\nregulations under which the penal  institutions shall be operated, .and in fa-.*;ir$ tc\nprovide a comprehensive code governing the conduct of the Plaintiffs within the\nInstitutions* and 1n failing to provide a code containing information regarding which\nInfraction shall be punished by which punishment, ar.d 1n falling to give notice to\nPlaintiffs of such rules and regulations and punishments, constitutes a denial to\nPlaintiffs of their rights to due process of lew under the Fifth and Fourteenth\n•  -14-\n\namendments to  the United  States  Constitution,\n82.  The actions  of  Defendants  1n arbitrarily  and capriciously  punishing  Plain-\ntiffs  for  infractions  of  so-called  rules  end regulations  of  the •Institutions,  of which\nPlaintiffs  have been given no notice,  by placing  Plaintiffs  in various  degrees of  sclita\nconfinement, without  allowing  them notice  of  the charge, a hearing at which they mey be\nrepresented, a right  to  confront the witnesses  against  therr., & right  to an impartial\npanel, a right  to  present witnesses  on their  own behalf,  a right  to have a reccrd  rate\nof  the proceedings, and a right  to be advised of  the maximum length cf  pyni'staent\nimposed, constitutes  a denial  to  Plaintiffs  of  rights  guaranteed  them by the  Fifth,\nSixth,  Ei;hth, and Fourteenth  amendments to  the United States  Constitution.\n83. The actions  of  Defendants  in failing  to grant  any appeal  from the action of\nthe behavior  clinic,  and in failing  to grant a meaningful  review to Plaintiffs  who have\nbeen placed  1n solitary  confinement,  1s a denial  of  rights  guaranteed to  Plaintiffs\nunder  the Fifth  Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitu-\ntion.\n84. The actions  of  Defendants  1n placing  Plaintiffs,  for  purposes of  punishment,\nin cells  which contain limited  ventilation, space, light,  and air,  and 1n forcing them\nto wear Inadequate clothing,  e.id depriving  them of  bedding, and control  over  their\nplumbing fixtures,  and 1n denying them access to mall  delivery,  human contact,  attorney:\ngovernment officials,  commissary  items, physical  exercise,  necessities  of  personal\nhygiene,  ?egal material,  reading matter  and medical  attention,  is  a denial  to the\nPlaintiffs  of  rights  guaranteed  them under the Fifth,  Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\namendments to  the United States  Constitution.\n85.  The action of  Defendants  in permitting  Plaintiffs  to be transferred  from one\nInstitution  to another  at  the arbitrary  and capricious  whim of  the Defendants and their\ncustodial  personnel, without  notice and without  an opportunity  to be heard, resulting\nin  the loss  to Plaintiffs  of  job  seniority,  and disruption  of  rehabilitative  programs,\nand the loss  of  contact with family and friends,  is  a denial  to  Plaintiffs  of  rights\nguaranteed to them by the Fifth,  Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth imendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\n86. The actions  of  Defendants  1n refusing  to  promulgate rules  governing such\ndemotion*!  transfers,  and to continue  to permit  their  agents to use such transfers  to\n-15-\n\nharass Plaintiffs and to prevent then from encaging in constitutionally protec-\nted activities, 1s a denial to Plaintiffs of rights guaranteed then under the first,\nFifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.\nS7. The actions of Defendants in permitting Plaintiffs to suffer less of\njob, pay, and other privileges as a result of being temporarily transferred to\nlocal County jails for appearance 1n Court- as a result of pending charges  or\npost-conviction relief hearings, is a denial to Plaintiffs of rights guaranteed\nthem by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Consti-\ntution.\nCensorship\n88. The actions of Defendants 1n Interfering with the confidential  rela-\ntionship between Plaintiffs and their attorneys, by allowing censorship of attor-\nney-client mall. Is a denial of rights guaranteed to Plaintiffs under the First,\nTifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.\n89. The action of Defendants In imposing unreasonable and arbitrary\nrestrictions on the reading matter available to Plaintiffs and on the manner in\nwhich they may obtain such reading matter, is a denial to Plaintiffs of rights\nguaranteed them under the Firstt Fifth and Fourteenth amendments to the United\nStates Coustitution.\n90. The action of Hefendants in failing to provide any reasonable pro-\ncedure by which Plaintiffs who have been arbitrarily denied access to certain\nreading matter  may have such decision reviewed, is a denial to Plaintiffs of\nrights guaranteed them by the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth amendments to the Uni-\nted States Constitution.\n91. The action to Defendants in failing to furnish Plaintiffs with ade-\nquate law libraries  is a denial to Plaintiffs of rights guaranteed then by the\nFirst, Fiftn, Sixth, Eighth, ind Fourteenth amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n-16-\n\nr\nMedical Cere\n92. The actions of Defendants 1n providing Inadeauate medical care to\nPlaintiffs, by failing to provide adequate treatment, by permitting delay in\ntreatment, by falling to provide Draper access to treatment, by permitting\ninappropriate treatments, and by permitting conditions which encourage drug\naddiction and create deviant behavior, constitute a denial to Plaintiffs of\nrights guaranteed them under the Fifth, Eighth,'and Fourteenth amendments to\nth,e United Stated Constitution,\n93.

In addition to the submissions of plaintiffs and defendants, the Court has\nconsidered the position of the United States government which intervened in the case\n1 The Amended Motion for Contempt supplements plaintiffs''Motion to Have Defendants and-Tlicir Agents\nHeld in Civil Contempt.  The Court will hereinafter refer to these two Motions as plaintiffs' contempt\nmotions.\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a) and submiUed a Memorandum of Law Concerning the\"\nConstitutionality of the Challenged Provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (Doc.\nNo. 791).  Oral argument was heard on November 19, 1997.  For the reasons set forth\nbelow, the Court concludes that the termination provisions of the Prison Litigation\nReform Act at issue are constitutional.  Accordingly, the Court will grant  defendants'\nMotion to Terminate All Outstanding Orders for Prospective Relief, deny  plaintiffs'\nMotion to Declare the Prison Litigation Reform Act Unconstitutional and deny  plaintiffs'\nmotion to Certify the Transfer of the Consent Decree and Related Orders to the\nCommonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.  The Court will also deny plaintiffs'  contempt\nmotions.\nI.  BACKGROUND\n1.  History of the Case\nBetween 1970 and 1971 four related cases challenging the constitutionality of\nconditions and policies at the seven Pennsylvania State Correctional Institutions (\"SCIs\")\nthen in operation2 were filed in this Court. On May 22,1978, after those suits had been\nconsolidated and a plaintiff class certified, then-Chief Judge Joseph S. Lord, III approved a\nConsent Decree which settled the majority of issues raised by the plaintiff class.  At that\ntime, the Court expressly retained jurisdiction over the Decree.  Since then, numerous issues\n: SCI Gratcrford, SCI Muncy, SCI Rockvicw, SCI Huntingdon, SCI Dallas, SCI Camp Hill, and SCI\nPittsburgh.\n\nhave been addressed in subsequent-opinions of the Court and various stipulations and\namendments to the Decree have been approved by the Court.3\nIn its current form, the Consent Decree and its amendments govern'many aspects of\nthe daily operations of the seven SCIs. The Decree required defendants to establish a code\nof conduct specifying both that behavior which was punishable - a misconduct - and the\ntype of punishment which could be imposed. The Decree also gives inmates certain rights\nwhen charged with a misconduct, including written notice, a hearing, the right to prepare\nand be assisted in presenting a defense, and the right to written findings.  Among its detailed\nprocedures, the Decree governs such things as: the handling of inmate mail; the right of\ninmates to obtain and keep outside publications; minimum inmate health care requirements;\nthe use of force, restraints and mace by prison officials; the information which must be\nprovided to new inmates; the procedures for conducting cell searches; the right of inmates to\nvisitors; the minimum inmate housing conditions; and the right of inmates to wear civilian\nclothing.\nIn 1980, the plaintiffs filed a contempt motion in which they alleged that defendants'\nwere not complying with a number of the provisions of the Consent Decree.  On December\n30,1980, with the assistance of United States Magistrate Judge William F. Hall, the parties\nstipulated to the dismissal of the motion for contempt and with the further assistance of\nMagistrate Judge Hall, the 1980 Stipulation was amended by an agreement of the parties\nand eventually approved by Judge Lord on May 11, 1983 [hereinafter the \"1983\nAmendment to Stipulation\"].  Some of the procedures established by the Consent Decree\nJ These include a 1980 Stipulation (approved January 8, 1980), a 1981 Stipulation (approved May 13, •\n1933), a 1981 Amendment to Stipulation (approved May 13, 1983), and a 1982 Agreement (approved May\n13, 1983).\n\nwere modified by the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation, principally the grievance and\nmisconduct procedures. The 1983 Amendment to Stipulation also addressed issues\ninvolving medical care, inmate law libraries, cell search procedures and administrative\ndetention.\nThe current round of litigation began when defendants filed a Motion to Terminate,\nseeking to end their obligations under the Consent Decree pursuant to the termination\nprovisions of thePLRA.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2)'. Plaintiffs countered with multiple\nfilings: the first seeks to have the PLRA declared unconstitutional or to have the case\ntransferred to the Commonwealth Court; the others seek to have defendants held in civil\ncontempt.\n2.  Issues Presented\nThe first, and primary, issue presented is whether the termination provisions of the\nPLRA are constitutional.  Plaintiffs have mounted a multi-prong constitutional attack on\nthese provisions, alleging that they violate the separation of powers embodied in Article III,\nthe due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, the equal protection rights inherent in the\nFifth Amendment, and, in a passing reference, the Tenth Amendment's reservation of\nunenumerated powers to the states. If the Court finds that the termination provisions survive\nthese challenges, it must decide whether, under the PLRA, defendants have satisfied the\nrequirements for termination.  Next, the Court must turn to the question of how plaintiffs'\ncontempt motions interact with the PLRA's termination provisions and defendants right to\nterminate the Decree.  Plaintiffs argue that even if the termination provisions are\nconstitutional, defendants' contempt requires this court to stay application of those\nprovisions, either by holding defendants' Motion to Terminate in abeyance or dismissing\n\nit until the contempt is purged; plaintiffs premise this argument on the Court's inherent\ncontempt power.  Alternatively, plaintiffs' seek to bar defendants from proceeding under the\nequitable doctrine of \"unclean hands.\" Defendants respond that there is no authority for\nsuch action and reiterate their position that the Court should end its supervision of the\nConsent Decree and its modifications by ordering termination of the Decree,  Finally, if\n. defendants are entitled to relief, the Court must decide what is appropriate:\na.  The PLRA's Termination Provisions\nThe termination provisions of the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2), recite that\ndefendants are \"entitled to immediate termination of any prospective relief if the relief\nwas approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is\nnarrowly drawn; extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\nright, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\nright.\" 4  Under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3), a court may not terminate relief if it finds that\nthere is a \"current and ongoing violation of the Federal right\"5 and that the relief is\nnarrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary and is the least intrusive means\npossible to correct the violation.  (Plaintiffs in this case have expressly declined to\nattempt to establish that there is a \"current and ongoing violation\" of a federal right.)\nMoreover, the court must \"promptly rule on any motion to modify or terminate\n* Prior to enactment of the PLRA, it is unlikely iliac a court would have made such findings in any case\ninvolving a consent decree.  No law prior to ihc PLRA required such findings and because a consent decree\nembodies an agreement between Ihc parties, there would have been no need for such findings.  This case is\nno exception: no findings meeting the standards of the PLRA were made with respect to the Consent\nDecree or its amendments.\n5 On November 27, 1997, the PLRA was amended by Pub.L. No. 105-119, § 123, 111 Stat. 2440 (1997)\nwhich, among other provisions, replaced \"current or ongoing violation\" -with \"current and ongoing\nviolation.\"  Congress provided dial llic amendments \"sluill take effect upon the date of the enactment of this\nAct and shall apply to pending cases.\"  Id. at § 123(b).\n\nprospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions'.\" l±  at § 3626(e)(l).*\nProspective relief is defined as \"all relief other than compensatory monetary damages,\"\nid § at 3626(g)(7) and relief expressly includes \"consent decrees.\"  14 at § 3626(g)(9).\nb.  Background of the Contempt.Mations\nOf particular importance to the current contempt motions is the 1983 Amendment to\nStipulation. Plaintiffs' contempt motions involve the issue of whether provisions in the\n1983 Amendment to Stipulation bind defendants to specific time lines for the resolution\nof prisoner grievances and misconducts.  The 1983 Amendment to Stipulation states that\n\"[defendants shall within 60 days of the approval of this Amendment submit to counsel\nfor the plaintiff-class, a proposal for an administrative grievance procedure for the\nprocessing of allegations by any member of the plaintiff-class ....\"  1983 Amendment to\nStipulation % I.B.I.  In addition, the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation clearly details\nprocedures for misconduct proceedings, including the requirement that the \"Program\nReview Committee shall render its decision within five (5) working days of receipt of an\nappeal\" and that the Superintendent must forward his decision to the inmate within three\nworking days of his receipt of an appeal of the Program Review Committee's decision.\nIn a Report and Recommendation dated May 5,1983, Magistrate Judge Hall made\ndetailed findings with respect to, and recommended approval of, the 1983 Amendment to\nStipulation.  Included in those findings was a lengthy discussion of the Consolidated\nInmate Grievance Review System submitted by defendants pursuant to the 1983\nAmendment to Stipulation and the time line for this review; the time line required the\n: Under the November 27, 1997 amendments, parties iruiy now bring a mandamus action \"for any failure to\nissue n prompt ruling...\" Pub.L. No. 105-119, § 123(;ij(3)(A) (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3626(c)(l)).\n\nInmate Grievance Coordinator to respond within ten days to a grievance; thereafter an\ninmate was permitted five days to appeal a decision to the Superintendent who then had\nto reach his or her own decision within ten days of the appeal.  The Superintendent's\ndecision was further appealable within seven days to the three-person Central  Office\nReview Committee (\"COR.C\") which had twenty-one days to reach a decision.  This\nsystem, and these time lines, were codified in DC-ADM 804 and remained in force until\nNovember 1, 1997.  See Stipulation of Uncontested Facts U 25. Magistrate Judge Hall's\nReport and Recommendation was approved and adopted by Judge Lord by Order dated\nMay 11,1983.7\nPlaintiffs contend in their contempt motions that the time lines are binding on\ndefendants, that defendants have failed to abide by the time lines, and that that failure\nconstitutes contempt on the part of defendants.  In response, defendants argue that they\nare not bound by the grievance procedures set forth in the Report and Recommendation\nbut only by those procedures contained in the body of the 1983 Amendment to\nStipulation itself which does not include the details of the Grievance Review System.\nThey have also stipulated that \"[fjrom January 1,1996, through the middle of 1997, the\ndefendants and their agents have failed in a significant number of instances to respond to\ninmate grievances and appeals therefrom within the time frames described in Magistrate\n[Judge] Hall's Report and Recommendation.\"  Stipulation of Uncontested Facts, ^ 24.\n1 The Order of May 11, 1983 was signed by Judge Lord. Defendants liavc noted, however, iluit neither th:\nCourt, the Clerks office nor any party have a copy of the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation which bears the\nsignature of Judge Lord, although all copies of the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation do bear the signatures\nof the party representatives.  Defendants suggest Uuit the failure of Judge Lord to sign the Amendment to\nStipulation casts its legitimacy into question. The Court rejects this argument.  All parties have, since\n1983, treated the Amendment to Stipulation as binding; all parties signed it; Magistrate Judge Hall clearly\nrecommended that it be approved and Judge Lord just as clearly approved it. The Court shall, therefore,\ntreat it as a binding amendment to the Consent Decree.\n\nAs of November 1,-1997; defendants amended DC-AJDM 804 to require only one\nmember of CORC to participate in any given appeal. They argue that this step will\nstreamline the grievance procedure and thus will benefit the plaintiff-class by increasing\nthe prison authority's response time to grievances.8 Plaintiffs contend that defendants\nmay not change these procedures because they are bound by the time lines detailed in\nMagistrate Judge Hall's Report and Recommendation.  •\nDefendants also acknowledge that \"[fjrom January 1, 1996, through the middle of\n1997, there have been instances where defendants and their agents have failed to respond\nto inmate misconduct appeals within the time delineated in Magistrate Judge Hall's\nReport and Recommendation.\"  Stipulation of Uncontested Facts ^ 31. Defendants add\nthat the procedures outlined by Magistrate Judge Hall exceed those recommended by the\nAmerican Correctional Association (\"ACA\"), ii, at ffij 27-30, and that they intend to\namend the procedures and bring them into conformity with the AC A standards if the\nConsent Decree is terminated.  Id. at T{ 32. Defendants further insist that the instances of\nnon-compliance with the misconduct time lines do not amount to a system or institution-\nwide violation and thus, under the terms of the consent decree, plaintiffs may not seek\ncontempt sanctions.9\n! Plaintiffs initially agreed to this new streamlined procedure, but withdrew their agreement because of\nconcerns that the proposed procedure would limit the right of inmates to appeal adverse decisions to the\nCommonwealth Court under Kisner v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 683 A.2d 353, 355-56 <Pa.\nCommw. 1996) (holding that the Central Office Review Committee performed \"stale-wide policy making\nfunctions\" and thus its decisions arc appealable to the Commonwealth Court).  For the reasons discussed in\nPart III of Uiis Memorandum, the Court will not address this issue.\n5 The Consent Decree provides that \"[p]!aintiffs... reserve the right to contest in this Court, at any time,\nby any appropriate legal proceeding, any institution or system wide pattern of failure or refusal by the\ndefendants or their agents or employees to follow the provisions of this Consent Decree.\"  Consent Decree\n1i XIX (emphasis added). The Decree also states that the \"Decree slml! not create a private cause of action\nin any individual against any of the defendants.  Nor, except as provided in paragraph XIX above, shall this\ndecree provide a basis for contempt proceedings.\"  Consent Decree \\ XXIII.\n\nIn addition to the alleged Failure of defendants to abide by the time frames set\nforth in the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation and Magistrate Judge Hall's Report and\nRecommendation, plaintiffs seek to prevent defendants from changing the regulation\ngoverning what type of clothing inmates may wear.  The regulation in force until  \"\nNovember 26, 1997 allowed inmates to wear various types of civilian clothing, including\nT-shirts and sweatshirts with commercial logos. See DC-ADM 815; Stipulation of\nUncontested Facts U 6.  The new regulation will effectively limit inmates to a narrow\nrange of approved clothing that is either white or cocoa brown and which does not\ndisplay any logo, trademark or brand name. See. Stipulation of Uncontested Facts ^ 16.\nThe consequence is that prisoners were required to dispose of those clothes in their\npossession which did not satisfy the new regulation before that regulation went into effect\non November 26, 1997. Possession of non-conforming clothes became punishable on\nDecember 26, 1997.  Id, at U 18.\nPlaintiffs seek to have defendants held in contempt on the ground that the new\nclothing regulation violates the original Consent Decree. With respect to that issue, the\nConsent Decree provides that \"[defendants shall permit residents to wear civilian\nclothing when the residents are housed in general population except to the extent that the\nsuperintendent of each institution requires institutional issue to be worn for work.\nHowever, defendants reserve the right to require residents to wear specific articles of\nclothing issued solely for the purpose of visitation during a resident's presence in the\nvisiting areas of the institution.  Furthermore, defendants reserve the right to impose\nreasonable regulations with respect to civilian clothing on the basis of safety, sanitary and\nsecurity considerations.\"  Consent Decree ^| XVII.\n\nAfter the escape of six prisoners on January 8, 1997, Commissioner of\nCorrections Martin Horn released a Report detailing the causes of, and concerns relating\nto, that escape.  See Id at ^  9-14. The report detailed \"Primary Causes of Escape\".and\n\"security lapses that allowed escape.\" The parties have stipulated that \"[t]he issue of\ninmate access to civilian clothing is listed only thereafter in the report as a concern\nrelated to the escape.\"  Id. at ^ 14. Defendants cite this security concern as a principal\nreason for the change in clothing policy.10\nPlaintiffs also seek to have defendants held in contempt based on defendants1\nalleged failure to provide inmates access to health care through sick calls on weekends.\nThe Consent Decree provides that at \"all Bureau of Corrections facilities which provide\ninpatient treatment for inmates, the Bureau shall provide twenty-four (24) hour medical\ncare to such inmates....  [And] [t]here will be daily sick call at all institutions by a\nproperly trained health professional.\"  Appendix A to Consent Decree, ^  4-5.\nInitially, because counsel for the plaintiff class lacked evidence to support the\nweekend sick call claim, it was voluntarily withdrawn.  After the hearing on the pending\nmotions, however, members of the plaintiff class filed Plaintiffs'  Objections to Portions\n10 Six members of the plaintiff class- Jon E. Yount, David S. Kopac, Derek S. Smith, Guy Bicking, James\nAlan Romberger, and Kenneth W. Teatcr - submitted Plaintiffs' Objections to Portions of \"Stipulation of\nUncontested Facts,\" filed December 16, 1997 (Doc. No. 828) in which they alleged that \"agents\" for the\ndefendants delayed their receipt of the Stipulation of Uncontested Facts. As a result, they could not timely\ninform their counsel of alleged errors in the Stipulation. They have two principal sets of objections.  The\nfirst is that there arc discrepancies and errors in the facts regarding the clothing regulations. These alleged\ndiscrepancies and errors  arc used to support an argument thai defendants luvc amended the clothing\nregulations, not as a safely measure, but, because the newly required clothing is manufactured at w\ncorrectional institution, as a fiscal one.  Plaintiffs' counsel did not advance this argument and h:is not\nmoved to amend the contempt motions.  By separate Order dated April 27, 1998, the Court has overruled\nthis first set of objections.  The second principal set of objections asserted by the above-named  plaintiffs\ninvolves the conduct of sick calls - addressed in more detail below in the body of the Memorandum.  At the\nrequest of plaintiffs' counsel, the Court has included this claim in its consideration of plaintiffs' contempt\nmotions.  Sec Ii\n\nof the \"Stipulation of Uncontested Facts,\" filed December 16* 1997 (Doc. No. 828). In\nthis filing, three members, John M. Payne, Stanley J. Hertzog and James (Sonny)\nWatson, stated in affidavits that in the past, it had been the defendants' practice to\nprovide sick calls on a daily basis.  Given this new information, counsel for plaintiffs'\nclass seeks both to reinstate the contempt claim based on inadequate health care and to,\nhave the affidavits introduced into evidence. The Court granted the requested relief.11'\n3.  Conclusion-Summary\nThe Court has carefully considered both the oral arguments and written\nsubmissions of the parties and concludes that the termination provisions of the Prison .\nLitigation Reform Act are constitutional.  As such, because the requirements of those\nprovisions are met, the Court will terminate the relief provided by the Consent Decree\nand its amendments.  The Court also concludes that it should take this action regardless\nof whether defendants are currently violating provisions of the Consent Decree.\nTherefore, to the extent plaintiffs seek coercive sanctions - that is, sanctions which force\ndefendants to comply with the terms of the Consent Decree - the Court need not, and will\nnot', reach the issue of whether defendants are in contempt.  To the extent, however, that\nplaintiffs seek compensatory sanctions - that is, sanctions ordering defendants to\ncompensate plaintiffs  for the loss of their civilian clothing - the Court finds that\ndefendants have not violated the provisions of the Consent Decree governing inmate\nclothing.\n\" The Court granted the requested relief by separate Orders dated April 27, 1998.\n\nH.  CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS OF,\nTHE PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT\nPlaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of the'termination provisions of the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act on many grounds.  They principally argue that the PLRA:\nviolates separation of powers; denies due process; and abridges the right of inmates to\nequal protection of the law.12  The Court examines each of these grounds below.  First,\nhowever, it must address a preliminary issue.  •  •  •\nPlaintiffs argue that the Court must examine the statute as a whole in determining\nwhether it is constitutional.  It would be improper, they contend, to examine the\ntermination provisions outside the context of the other provisions - such as the limits on\nfederally enforceable settlements, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3626(a)(l)(A), 3626(c), on the duration\nof relief, id. at 3626(b), on preliminary injunctions, id. at 3626(a)(2), and on the right of\nprisoners to proceed in forma pauperis. 28 U.S.C. § 1915, to name just a few.  This\nimpropriety exists, they argue, because, while any one provision might withstand\nconstitutional scrutiny, when taken together, the PLRA's provisions unfairly burden\nprison inmates and are thus unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs cite Romer v. Evans. — U.S. —,\n—, 116 S.Ct. 1620 (1994) for the proposition that courts, when determining whether a\nstatute measures up to constitutional norms, should look at the entire statute.\nThe Court rejects the approach advanced by plaintiffs.  It will not examine the\nconstitutionality of the PLRA in its entirety.  Romer involved a facial challenge to an\n11 To date, six circuits have examined similar attacks on the constitutionality of llic PLRA.  Five of ihe six\nhave rejected arguments like those presented by plaintiffs in the case at bar. Sec Hndix v. Johnson. 133\nF.3d 940 (6th Cir. 1998); Gavin v, Bronstad. 122 F.3d 1031, 1088-89 (8th Cir. 1997); Doiman v. Sintilclnrv.\n129 F.3d 1424, 1427 f H* Cir. 1997); Inmalcs of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse. 129 F.3d 649, 656-57 (I\"\nCir.  1997); Plvlcr v. Moore. 100 F.3d 365, 372 (4* Cir. 1996). The Second Circuit, although holding in\nihc face of similar arguments that the PLRA is constitutional, did so only after construing the language of\nthe termination provision as-requiring only termination of relief, not of ihc decree itself.  Sec Benjamin v.\nJncobson. 124 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 1997), rch'c; held en bane February 25, 1998. The Third Circuit has yet to\nspeak to these issues.\n\nentire statute and the Supreme Court therefore examined the statute as a whole.  See ]4 at\n1623; see also Douganv. Sincletarv. 129F.3d 1424. 1427 n. 15 (11th Cir  1997).  In this\ncase, only the termination provisions of the PLRA are at issue, and the Court will address\nonly those provisions.\nThe Court turns, therefore, to plaintiffs' first argument: that the termination\nprovisions violate Article Ill's separation of powers both by reopening a final judgment\nand prescribing a rule of decision.\nA.  Separation of Powers\n\"In republican government the legislative authority, necessarily, predominates.\"\nThe Federalist No. 51, 350 (James Madison) (J.E. Cooke ed., 1961). This truism has\nmeant that the \"Court has declined to adopt formalistic and unbending rules.... [in\norder not to] unduly constrict Congress' ability to take needed and innovative action\npursuant to its Article I powers.\"  Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor 478\nr\nU.S. 833, 851 (1986) (holding that act giving Commodities Futures Trading Commission\npower to entertain state law counterclaims does not violate Article III) (citations omitted).\nAt the same time, however, a court must examine legislation \"with an eye to the practical\neffect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the\nfederal judiciary ...  [and must consider] the extent to which the 'essential attributes of\njudicial power' are reserved to Article III courts... the origins and importance of the\nright to be adjudicated, and the concerns that drove Congress to depart from the\nrequirements of Article III.\"  Id, (citations omitted).\nPlaintiffs argue first that the PLRA is unconstitutional because the termination\nprovisions violate separation of powers.  After careful examination, however, the Court\n\nmust conclude -  like six ctrcutts'feefore it -that the PLRA neither reopens a final\njudgment nor prescribes a rule of decision in violation of the Constitution.\n1.  Reopening Final Judgments\nPlaintiffs contend that by providing for the termination of consent decrees,\nCongress has violated separation of powers - unconstitutionally encroaching on. the\njudiciary - by reopening a final judgment.  The proposition that Congress may not\nconstitutionally reopen final judgments was recently articulated by the Supreme Court in\nPlaut v. Spendthrift Farms. Inc.. 514 U.S. 211 (1995). That case involved an earlier\ndecision, Lampf. Pleva. Lipkind. Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson. 501 U.S. 350 (1991),\nin which the Supreme Court adopted a national limitations period applicable to civil\nactions under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Unhappy with the result of\nthis uniform statute of limitations, Congress enacted a statute which required courts to .\nreinstate § 10(b) actions which had been pending before Lampf. but were then dismissed\nas a result of the Lampf limitations period. Plaut's case was dismissed as untimely in\naccordance with Lampf and no appeal was taken; only after Congress enacted the new\nstatute did Plaut seek reinstatement of his case.\nIn Plaut, the Court concluded that Congress \"exceeded its authority by requiring\nthe federal courts to exercise 'the judicial Power of the United States,' U.S. Const., Art.\nIll, § 1, in a manner repugnant to the text, structure and traditions of Article III.\"  Plaut at\n218.  Congress did so by \"retroactively commanding the federal courts to reopen final\njudgments,\" ia\\ at 219, because once a judgment has \"achieved finality ...  a judicial\ndecision becomes the last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case\nor controversy, and congress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law\n\n.applicable to that very case was something other than1 what the court said it was.\"  Ia\\ at'\n227.\nThat Congress may not reopen a final judgment is a premise of law which cannot\nbe questioned.  The issue presented, though, is whether a consent decree is a \"final\njudgment\" for separation of powers purposes. Plaintiffs rely on Rufo v. Inmates of\nSuffolk County Jail. 502 U.S. 367 (1992), for the proposition that a consent decree \"is an\nagreement that the parties'desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a\njudicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and\ndecrees.\"  Id. at 378.  As such, the Rufo Court said that \"a consent decree is a final\njudgment that may be reopened only to the extent that equity requires.\"  Id. at 391.\nIt should be noted, however, that these broad statements of law in Rufo were\nmade in the context of a discussion of the circumstances that permit a court to modify a\nconsent decree: In general, a \"party seeking modification of a consent decree may meet\nits initial burden by showing... a significant change either in factual conditions or law.\"\nRufo at 384.  Indeed, a \"consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later turns out,\none or more of [its] obligations has become impermissible under federal law.\"  Id. at 388;\nsee alsp Aeostini v. Felton. 117 S.Ct. 1997, 2006 (1997) (\"A court errs when it refuses to\nmodify an injunction or consent decree in light of...  changes\" in decisional or statutory\nlaw); Landeraf v. USI Film Prods.. 511 U.S. 244,273 (1994) (\"When the intervening\nstatute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the new\nprovision is not retroactive.\"); System Federation No. 91 v. Wriuht. 364 U.S. 642, 652\n(1961) (a \"court will not continue to exercise its powers... [under a decree] when a\nchange in law or facts has made inequitable what was once equitable\").  In contrast to\n\nprospective relief which may be: modified, ari'award of monetary damages is tnaly final,\nregardless of changes in the underlying law.  As the Court put it in Plaut. a judgment is\nfinal for separation of powers purposes when it is the \"last word of the judicial\ndepartment with regard to a particular case or controversy.\"  Plaut at 227.  A. consent\ndecree simply is not the \"last word\" of a court on a particular case or controversy.  .\nThe distinction - between prospective relief and final awards - is best\ndemonstrated in the Supreme Court's early decision in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and\nBelmont Bridge Co.. 59 U.S. (18 How.) 421 (1855) [hereinafter \"Wheeling Bridge\"]. In\nthat case, the Supreme Court held that Congress could change the law such that the Court\nwas required to end an injunction it had ordered in an earlier case.\nWheeling Bridge arose out of an earlier case in which the Supreme Court had held\nthat a bridge was a public nuisance because it interfered with navigable waters and\nordered the bridge raised or removed.  After this decision, the bridge was destroyed in a\nstorm; when rebuilding commenced, Pennsylvania sought enforcement of the prior order  .\nin an effort to prevent reconstruction of the bridge. In the interim, however, Congress\nhad passed a law making the bridge part of a post-road which could not be interfered with\nby riparian navigation.  This, the Court held in Wheeling Bridge, was well within the\npowers of Congress although it dictated an outcome different from the one the Court had\nreached in the earlier case, namely,, that the prior injunction could not be enforced and the\nbridge could therefore be rebuilt.\nPlaintiffs argue that Wheeling Bridge makes a distinction between \"public\" rights\nand \"private\" rights.  Congress, they say, has the power to alter prospective relief only\nwhere it has plenary power over the underlying law, v/here, in other words, the\n\nunderlying law concerns a \"public\" right\". According to plaintifFs, because the consent\ndecree in this case is premised on the constitutional rights of inmates, private rights,\nCongress may not alter the scope of the Consent Decree. This argument derives from the\nSupreme Court's statement in Wheeling Bridge that: \"it is urged, that the act of congress\ncannot have the effect and operation to annul the judgment of the court already rendered,\nor the rights determined thereby....  This, as a general proposition, is certainly not to be\ndenied, especially as it respects adjudication upon the private rights of parties.  When\nthey have passed into judgment the right becomes absolute, and it is the duty of the court\nto enforce it.\"  Wheeling Bridge at 431 (emphasis added). That is far from a holding that\nthe rationale of Wheeling Bridge is limited to those cases involving a public right.\nThe \"public\" rights doctrine was explored by the Supreme Court in Northern\nPipeline Const. V. Marathon Pipe Line Co.. 458 U.S. 50 (1982) in which it was explained\nthat the \"doctrine ...  draws upon the principal of separation of powers, and a historical\nunderstanding that certain prerogatives were reserved to the political Branches of\nGovernment.\"  Id. at 67.  The doctrine allows Congress to allocate certain types of\nadjudicatory authority to non-Article III courts hearing cases involving those public\nrights issues historically \"reserved to the political\" branches.  See, e^g., Murray's Lessee\nv. Hobofen Land & Improvement Co;, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 272 (1856); Crowell v.\nBenson. 285 U.S. 22 (1932).  While Wheeling Bridge did, in part, rely on this public\nrights/private rights distinction, the doctrine has no place in the instant case.\nThe distinction made in Wheeling Bridce which is important to this case - and\none to which the Supreme Court referred when discussing absolute \"private\" rights - was\nthe distinction between prospective relief and money damages:\n\nNow, we agree, if the remedy in this case had been .an action at law, and a\njudgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff For damages, the right to these\nwould have passed beyond the reach of the power of congress.  It. would\nhave depended, not upon the public right of the free navigation of the\nriver, but upon the judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as\nit respect the costs adjudged, stands upon the same principles, and is\nunaffected by the subsequent law. But that part of the decree, directing the\nabatement of the obstruction, is executor)1, a continuing decree, which\nrequires not only the removal of the bridge, but enjoins the defendants\nagainst any reconstruction or continuance, Now, whether it is a future\nexisting or continuing obstruction depends upon the question whether or\nnot it interferes with the right of navigation. If, in the mean time, since the\ndecree, this right has been modified by the competent authority, so that the\nbridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction, it is quite plain the decree of\nthe court cannot be enforced.\nWheeling Bridge. 59 U.S. at 431-32 (emphasis added). It is this distinction which\nultimately determines the right of Congress to change the law in such a way that relief\nmust be altered or modified.  The issue then- is not the source or validity of the legal rule\nproducing the judgment, \"but rather the immunity from legislative abrogation of those\njudgments themselves.\" Plaut at 230. The Court relied on this distinction in Plaut when it\nrejected the argument that Wheeling Bridge was precedent for Congress* right to reopen\njudgments.  The Court noted in Plaut that the statute at issue in Wheeling Bridge \"altered\nthe prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts\" and that \"nothing in\nour holding today calls [that decision]... into question.\"  Plaut at 232.\nFor purposes of this case then, the only meaningful distinction is that between\njudgments ordering prospective relief- subject to alteration when Congress changes the\napplicable law - and judgments awarding damages - which cannot be reopened'by\nCongress,  The consent decree in this case provides only for prospective relief.  Congress\nhas changed the law governing the consent decree.13 The Court therefore concludes that\n13 Plaintiffs contend that because the Consent Decree settled a suit cluillcnging ilic constitutionality of\nprison practices, Congress in establishing icrininniion procedures, is altering the constitutional basis for the\n\nthe PLRA does not unconstitutionally reopen a final judgment.  See Dougan. 129 F.3d at\n1427 (\"Consent decrees are final judgments but 'not the last word of the judicial\ndepartment'\" and are thus not final judgments for separation of powers purposes); Gavin\nv. Branstad, 122 F.3d 1081, 1088-89 (8* Cir. 1997); Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v.\nRouse, 129 F.3d 649, 656-57 (1st Cir. 1997).14\n2.  Rule of Decision\nIn 1788 Alexander Hamilton wrote that \"the courts of justice are to be considered\nas the bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative encroachments ....\"  The\nFederalist No. 78, 526 (Alexander Hamilton) (J.E. Cooke ed., 1961).  This principle is\ncentral to our constitutional system of government.  Accordingly, Congress may not tell a\ncourt how to decide a specific case.  See United States v. Klein. 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128\n(1871). However, Congress has a great deal of freedom under Article III to limit the\njurisdiction of lower courts, see, g^,  Sheldon v. Sill. 49 U.S. (8 How.) 441 (1850)\n(\"[Hjaving a right to prescribe, Congress may withhold from any court of its creation\njurisdiction of any of the enumerated controversies.\"), and, more importantly for the\nrelief awarded, which it may not do. The Court rejects this argument.  Congress has not attempted to alter\nthe constitutional basis of relief; indeed, under the PLRA plaintiffs are free to establish violations of a\nfederal right which includes constitutional rights. They have not done so in this case.\n11 Plaintiffs urge the Court to examine the liistory of Article 111, as Justice Scalia did in Plant, and argue thai\nby doing so, it must conclude tliai the intent of the Framcrs was precisely to avoid tlie type oflegislative\nentanglement in the judiciary as is represented by the PLRA.  Indeed, it is true tliat the \"sense of sharp\nnecessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power, prompted by the crescendo of legislative\ninterference with private judgments of the courts, triumphed among the Framcrs of the new Federal\nConstitution.\"  Plant. 514 U.S. at 220.  The abuses of prc-Rcvolutionary legislatures, however, were of the\ntype found in Plant: legislative reversals of final judicial decisions. The Court cannot find a compelling\nreason in this, albeit fascinating, history to alter its conclusion that the Consent Decree is not a fiiuil\njudgment for separation of powers purposes.\n\npurposes of this case, Congress-has the freedom to establish standards by which a court\njudges a case.  See, e^,  Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Snc'y, 503 U.S. 429 (1992).\nIt is true that the Constitution \"commands that the independence of the Judiciary\nbe jealously guarded, and it provides clear institutional protections for that\nindependence,\"  Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.. 458 U.S. 50, 60\n(1982), because the \"accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in\nthe same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed,\nor elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"  The Federalist No.\n47,324 (James Madison) (J.E. Cooke ed., 1961). Thus, it is the prerogative of the\njudiciary to declare \"what the law is,\" and apply that law to the facts before it.  Marburv\nv. Madison. 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). This clear delineation of powers was the basis\nfor the Supreme Court's holding that Congress had overstepped its constitutional bounds\nwhen it dictated a rule of decision in Klein. 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128.\nKlein was decided during the complex political turmoil following the Civil War.\nA federal statute allowed citizens who had been living in the Confederacy to recover\nproperty seized during the war upon proof of their loyalty to the Union, which proof\nincluded a demonstration that they had not acted against the Union during the war.  By\nanother act, the President was authorized to extend pardons to former Confederates.  The\nPresident did so in the case of V.F. Wilson whose estate, through its administrator Klein,\nsought to recover property confiscated by the United States.  As proof of Wilson's\nloyalty, the claimant proffered  the presidential pardon.  The Court of Claims accepted\nthis proof, although it also found evidence that Wilson had offered aid and comfort to\n\nConfederates during the war.  Nonetheless, the'evidence of the pardon was held to be\nsufficient demonstration of loyalty and restitution was ordered.\nWhile the case was pending on appeal before the Supreme Court, Congress\npassed a new law which provided that a Presidential pardon could not be offered as proof\nin court where a party was advancing a claim against the United States.. The statute went\non to explicitly strip the Supreme Court of its appellate jurisdiction upon a finding that\nthe pardon was the basis of decision in the lower court. Faced with a statute that stripped\nthe Court of jurisdiction upon making certain findings, the Court held that the statute was\nunconstitutional, in part, because \"the court is forbidden to give effect to the evidence\nwhich, in its own judgment, such evidence should have, and is directed to give it an effect\nprecisely contrary.\"  Klein at 147. The effect of the act, in other words, was to \"prescribe\na rule for the decision of a cause in a particular way.\" Id at 146.\nThe \"rule of decision\" doctrine depends on the distinction between a rule\nprescribing an outcome - which would be unconstitutional - and a change in the\nunderlying law which may of necessity dictate a new outcome - which would be\nconstitutional.  Thus, in Wheeling Bridge, the Court held that Congress could change the\nlaw in such a way that it dictated an outcome different from the one the Court had\nreached in an earlier case.  This distinction, between a rule of decision and a change in\ngoverning law, was further explained in Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc'y. 503 U.S.\n429 (1992).  That case involved a legislative balance between preservation of endangered\nspotted owls and the economic needs of loggers in the Northwest.  Before the change in\nlaw at issue in that case, two groups had challenged, in separate cases, certain logging in\nthe Northwest on the basis that the logging effectively killed or \"took\" spotted owls - an\n\nendangered species -  in violation of numerous provisions of federal law.  During the\npendency of these suits, Congress passed legislation which expressly named the two\ncases.  See Section 318 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies  .\nAppropriations Act, 1990, 103 Stat. 745, popularly known as the Northwest Timber\nCompromise [the \"Timber Act\"].  Provisions of the Timber Act - section (b)(3) and  •\n(b)(5) - prohibited logging in designated areas. The legislation further directed that\n\"management of areas according to subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this section ... is\nadequate consideration for the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements that are the\nbasis [for the pending cases].\"  Section 318(b)(6)(A) of the Timber Act.  The Ninth\nCircuit held that the Timber Act violated Article III because it directed a rule of decision,\nthat is, it dictated the outcomes of the pending cases.  Seattle Audubon Soc'v v.\nRobertson. 914 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. 1990). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the\nprovisions at issue merely modified or amended existing law but did not prescribe an\noutcome, reasoning that the courts were still required to determine whether the parties\nmet the standards of section (b)(6)(A), namely that management of areas was in accord\nwith subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5).  Seattle Audubon. 503 U.S. at 438.\nThe distinction between a prescribed outcome and a mere change in governing\nlav/ can be difficult  to make.  See, ej*., Benjamin v. Jacobson. 124 F.3d at 174\n(discussing difficulty of distinguishing between a change in law and a prescribed\noutcome).  In the case at bar, however, the Court concludes that the statute at issue\nsimply effects a constitutionally permissible change in law.  That is, the PLRA\nestablishes a new standard, but leaves it to the courts to apply that standard.  In the words\nof the Fourth Circuit:\n\n  ,  . While § 3626(b)(2) requires a district court to terminate prospective relief\n>\nthat was approved in the absence of a finding that the relief is no greater\nthan necessary to correct the violation of a federal right, it does not purport\nto state how much relief is more than necessary.  In short, § 3626(b)(2)\nprovides only the standard to which district courts must adhere, not the\nresult they must reach.\nPlvler v. Moore'. 100 F.3d 365, 372 (4th Cir. 1996).  '\nPlaintiffs in this case\"could have presented evidence of a, \"current and ongoing\nviolation\" of a federal right in an attempt to qualify under the new standard set forth in\nthe PLRA.  Had they done so, the Court would have applied the new law to the facts\nadduced - it would have determined whether the evidence established a current and\nongoing violation and whether to terminate or modify relief under the PLRA.  It cannot\nbe said, therefore, that Congress is prescribing a rule of decision or that the PLRA is an\nunconstitutional encroachment on the judiciary because the Court is able to apply the\nprovisions of the new law to the facts presented and decide what relief, if any, is\nappropriate.  See also Douganv. Singletarv. 129 F.3d at 1427; Gavin v. Barnstad  122\nT\nF.3d at 1088; Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse. 129 F.3d at 657-58.\nB.  Due Process\n1.  Vested Rights\nPlaintiffs argue that under the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, a judgment,\nonce vested, cannot be abrogated by an action of Congress.  S_ee McCullough v. Virginia.\n172 U.S. 102, 123-24 (1898).  While true, \"the vested rights doctrine is really only the\ndue process analogue of separation-of-powers doctrine that prevents Congress from\nreopening final judgments of Article III courts...  [and] a judgment that is not final for\npurposes of separation of powers is also not final for purposes of due process.\"  Gavin.\n\n122F,3d at 1091. Thus, the Court's discussion of final judgments in the context of\nseparation of powers above, amply answers this argument: a prospective order cannot\nbecome vested for due process purposes.\nPlaintiffs also rely on cases holding that consent decrees \"resemble\" contracts,\nsee, e.c. Local No. 93. Int'l Assoc. of Firefighters v. Cleveland. 478 U.S. 501. 519  .\n(1986), and analogize the vested right in a consent decree to rights in property which,\nonce acquired, cannot be defeased without due process. However, injunctive relief of the\ntype mandated by the Consent Decree has a prospective effect and litigants have \"no\n'vested right' in the decree entered by the trial court\"  Landsraf. 511 U.S. at 247 (citing\nAmerican Steel Foundries v. Tri-Citv Central Trades Council. 257 U.S. 184, 201 (1921)).\nMoreover, \"[fjederal  regulation of future action based upon rights previously acquired by\nthe person regulated is not prohibited by the Constitution.  So long as the Constitution\nauthorizes the subsequently enacted legislation, the fact that its provisions limit or\ninterfere with previously acquired rights does not condemn it.\"  Fleming v. Rhodes. 331\nU.S. 100,107 (1947).\nThe Court therefore concludes that plaintiffs do not have a vested right in the\nConsent Decree under the Fifth Amendment.  Accordingly, the PLRA, by authorizing\ntermination of prospective relief, does not deprive plaintiffs of property without due\nprocess.  See also Dougan. 129F.3dat 1427: Gavin. 122F.3dat  1091: Inmates of\nSuffolk County Jail, 129 F.3d at 658 (holding that because a consent decree ordering\nprospective relief must be open to modification if there is a change in law or\n\ncircumstances, it cannot become vested); Plvler v. Moore. 100 F.3d 365, 374 (4l!l Cir.\n1996).\" '\n2.  Contract Rights\nPlaintiffs urge the Court to find that Congress has impermissibly impaired their\ncontract with the Commonwealth - the Consent Decree- in violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment.  Defendants counter that the Consent Decree is not a\ncontract for purposes of the Due Process clause. The Court will nonetheless assume,\nwithout deciding, that the Consent Decree is a contract for purposes of this discussion.\nSee Rufo. 502 U.S. at 378 (\"A consent decree... in some respects is contractual in\nnature\").\nNormally when examining a federal statute which affects a private contract, a\ncourt must engage in a deferential analysis, finding the statute unconstitutional only if it\nis arbitrary and irrational.  SeeNat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison. Topeka & Santa\nFeRv. Co.. 470 U.S. 451, 472 (1985). Plaintiffs argue that in this case, the Court should\nengage in heightened scrutiny because the state government, in seeking to terminate a\ndecree to which it is a party, is impairing its own \"contract.\"  See Garcia v. San Antonio\nMetropolitan Transit Authority. 469 U.S. 528 (1985). The Court rejects this invitation to\nengage in an enhanced scrutiny of the PLRA. The federal government - the government\nwhich enacted the PLRA and thereby established the standard for termination -  is clearly\n15 Plaintiffs again make the public rights/private rights distinction in the context of their due process\nargument. They cite Hodncs v. Snvdcr. 261 U.S. 600,603 (1923), which limits the holding in McCullogh -\nthat once vested, a judgment cannot be abrogated by an act of Congress - by stating that for Due Process\npurposes, public rights may not become vested, only private rights. Tins issue is not implicated in this\ncase, however, for if a party can liavc no property right in the underlying order - the order is not final for\ndue process purposes -  it matters not whether it confers a public or a private right because it cannot become\nvested in cither case.  Sec Gavin. 122 F.3d at 1091 n. 10.\n\nnot a party to the Consent Decree in this case and where \"the Government [enacting the\nlegislation] is not a party to the contract at issue,... there is no reason to argue for a\nheightened standard of review.\"  Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. at 472 n.24.  Thus, a\nheightened standard of review is not appropriate.  Instead; the Court will examine the\nstatute only to determine whether it is arbitrary and irrational, a test which is a Due\nProcess equivalent of the rational basis test under the Equal Protection Clause.\nAs the Court explains more fully below in its discussion of plaintiffs'  Equal\nProtection challenge, the PLRA cannot be deemed to be arbitrary and irrational.  Whether\none agrees with the purposes motivating passage of the PLRA, for the reasons stated  '••\nbelow, it cannot be questioned that it is a rational attempt to limit the involvement of\nfederal courts in the day to day management of state prisons.  The Court therefore\nconcludes that the PLRA does not unconstitutionally impair plaintiffs' contract rights.\nSee also Gavin. 122 F.3d at 1091-92; Inmates of Suffolk County Jail. 129 F.3d at 658-59.\nC.  Equal Protection\nPlaintiffs next argue that the PLRA unconstitutionally violates the equal\nprotection rights inherent in the Fifth Amendment.  See Mathews v. de Castro. 429 U.S.\n181, 182 n.l (1976) (\"It is well settled that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause\nencompasses equal protection principles.\").  Normally, a court will presume that\nlegislation is valid and must uphold it unless it draws a classification that is not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate purpose.  See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.. Inc.. 473\nU.S. 432, 440 (1985).  On this issue, as in the context of their Due Process claim,\nplaintiffs urge this Court to employ a heightened scrutiny in this case because the PLRA\n\nacts to burden inmates* fundamental right of access to the courts.  '\"[Classifications\naffecting fundamental rights are given the most exacting scrutiny.' Clark v. Jeter. 486\nU.S. 456,461, 108S.Ct. 1910, 1914, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988) (citation omitted).

Williams. 124 F.3d 411, 422 (3d Cir. 1997) (other citation omitted).\nHowever, where a statutory classification or distinction \"neither burdens a fundamental\nright nor targets a suspect class,16 we will uphold [it] so long as it bears a rational relation\nto some legitimate end.\"  Romer. 116 S.Ct. at 1627.17\n1.  Fundamental Rights\nIt goes without saying that for equal protection purposes, access to the courts is a\nfundamental right.  See Wolff v. McDonnell. 418 U.S. 539. 578 (1974V  Plaintiffs argue\nthat the termination provisions of the PLRA- by limiting the right of inmates to obtain\nprospective relief in a way that other classes are not limited - unconstitutionally burdens\nthis right.  The Court must, however, reject this argument because the PLRA does not\nclose the courthouse doors to prisoners.  In making this argument, plaintiffs conflate the\nright of access with the right to relief and they are not the same thing.  The PLRA does\nnot prevent inmates from presenting claims of constitutional violations to a court, nor\n16 Plaintiffs do not contend that inmates arc a suspect class.\n\"  In the context of their equal protection arguments, plaintiffs assert that the PLRA violates the Tenth\nAmendment by limiting the right of state officials to settle litigation. Sec United Slates v. Bckins. 304 U.S.\n27, 51-52 (1938) (\"It is of the essence of sovereignty to be able to make contracts and give consents\nbearing upon the exertion of government power.\"). The Court rejects tills contention.  The PLRA docs not\nprohibit slates from c-nlcring into \"private settlement-agreements.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3G2G(c)(2).  Instead, the\nPLRA merely limits Uic jurisdiction of federal courts with respect to enforcement of such agreements.\nThus, suite sovereignty is in no way threatened by the PLRA.\n\ndoes it prevent courts from remedying any established violations; it simply limits the\nform and type of relief inmates may be awarded. This certainly gives inmate '\"a\nreasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental\nconstitutional rights to the courts.'\" Lewis v. Casey. 116S.Q. 2174, 2180(1996)\n(quoting Bounds v. Smith. 430 U.S. 817, 825 (1977)); see also Gavin. 122 F.3d at 1089.\nThus, because the legislation does not burden a fundamental right, the Court will not\nengage in a strict scrutiny analysis of the PLRA.\n2.  Rational Basis\nRational basis review is an extremely deferential form of review for it is the \"role\nof the political branches to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to\ncomply with the laws and the Constitution.\"  Lewis, 116 S.Ct. at 2179.  A statute survives\nsuch review so long as it \"bear[s] a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate\nlegislative end.\" Romer,  116 S.Ct. at 1627.  Where \"there are plausible reasons for [the\nlegislative] action, [the court's] inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, 'constitutionally\nirrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision.'\" U.S. Railroad\nRetirement Board v. Fritz. 449 U.S. 166, 179 (1980) (quoting Flemming v. Nestor. 363\nU.S. 603, 612 (I960)).  Moreover,\nthe burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative\nevery conceivable basis which might support it, whether or not the basis\nhas a foundation in the record. Finally, courts are compelled under\nrational-basis review to accept a legislature's generalizations even when\nthere is an imperfect fit between means and ends.  A classification  does\nnot fail rational-basis review because it is not made with mathematical\nnicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\nHeller v. Doe. 509 U.S. 312, 319-21 (1993).\n\nA discernable -  and legitimate - purpose of the PLRA is to preserve \"state\nsovereignty by protecting states from overzealous supervision by the federal courts in the\narea of prison conditions litigation.\"  Plyler. 100 F.3d at 374. This purpose is borne out\nby the PLRA1 s legislative history, which recites:\nthat the drafters intended the Act to 'address the alarming explosion in the\nnumber of frivolous lawsuits filed by State and Federal prisoners,'.to  .\ncmak[e] it much more difficult  for Federal judges to issue orders directing\nthe release of convicted criminals from prison custody,' 141 Cong. Rec.\n14,413 (1995) (statement of Sen. Dole), and to wrest control of state\npenitentiaries from federal courts so that states 'will be able to run the\nprisons as they see fit unless there is a constitutional violation,' kL at\n14,419 (statement of Sen. Abraham).\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail. 129 F.3d at 660. The legislative history thus more than\nadequately demonstrates at least one legitimate goal: the desire to limit federal court\noversight of state prisons.  The way Congress has chosen to reach this goal - the PLRA  -\nis a perfectly rational means to that end. The PLRA therefore amply satisfies the rational\nbasis test.\nPlaintiffs argue that in passing the PLRA, Congress was motivated by an animus\ntoward inmates and that where a statute \"singl[es] out a certain class of citizens for\ndisfavored legal status or general hardship^,\" Romer, 116 S.Ct. at 1628, it violates the\nequal protection clause.  Plaintiffs have thus teased from the holding in Romer a new\nconstitutional standard of review in equal protection cases, something greater than the\nrational basis test described above.  The Court does not believe that the Supreme Court\nestablished a new standard, for it found that the only purpose of the statute at issue in that\ncase was animus toward homosexuals, which is simply not legitimate:\nEven laws enacted for broad and ambitious purposes often can be\nexplained by reference to legitimate public policies which justify  the\n\nincidental disadvantages they impose on certain persons.  Amendment 2\n[the law at issue], however, in making a general announcement that gays\nand lesbians shall not have any particular protections from the law, inflicts\nOn them immediate, continuing, and real injuries that outrun and belie any\nlegitimate justifications that may be claimed for it.  We conclude that, in\naddition to the far-reaching deficiencies of Amendment 2 that we have\nnoted, the principles it offends, in another sense, are conventional and\nvenerable;  a law must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate\ngovernmental purpose ... and Amendment 2 does not.\nRomer at 1628-29. The PLRA does not have the same sweeping effect/for  § 3626(b)\nsimply narrows the protections afforded inmates to the constitutional minimum, it does\nnot eliminate those protections.\nEven if plaintiffs are correct, however, and courts must engage in a form of\nheightened scrutiny where there is evidence of some animus, the discussion of the\nlegislative history above sufficiently demonstrates legitimate reasons for the PLRA;\nplaintiffs have not come forward with evidence that animus was the principal motivating\nfactor.18  Moreover, it has been established that in some contexts states may, without\nviolating the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, impose greater\nburdens on inmates as a class; white prisoners are certainly not stripped of all\nconstitutional rights by the fact of their incarceration, see, e^g., Turner v. Saflev. 482 U.S.\n78, 84-85 (1987), those rights may be limited and, in some cases, eliminated.  See, e.g..\n12 Plaintiffs argued that this district is uniquely situated to understand that animus to prisoners motivated\npassage of the PLRA because congressional unhappincss with Harris v. City of Philadelphia. 47 F.3d 1311\n(3d Cir. 1995), served as a catalyst for the PLRA's enactment. The Court docs not doubt that prisoners arc\nconsidered by the public to be an unpopular class and tluit such unpopularity helped usher the PLRA\nthrough Congress. Nonetheless, even under a heightened rationality test, there is sufficient evidence tlial\nlegitimate purposes motivated passage as well. Moreover, the evidence of animus submitted by plaintiffs  -\nsuch as fiery statements by members of the Senate like \"criminals... deserve to be punished ....  prjhcir\nlives should, on the whole be dcscribablc by the old concept known as'hard time.'\" Sen. Abraham, 141\nCong.Rcc. at S14419 - must, in the words of the First Circuit, \"be taken with a grain of salt - elected\nofficials, after all, liavc been known to strike poses for public consumption - the most'that fairly can be said\nis that oratory of this sort may evince a philosophical shift; it luirdly betokens an impermissible animus.\"\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail. 1997 WL 685532 at *I2.\n\nRichardson v. Ramirez. 418 U.S. 24, 54 (1974) (holding that convicted felons who have\nserved their time may be disenfranchised  by the state without violating the Fourteenth\nAmendment).  In this case, the burden imposed by the PLRA -  that inmates prove a\n\"current and ongoing violation\" of a federal right - is not unreasonable and does not\nviolate the equal protection rights of inmates. For all these reasons, the Court concludes\nthat the PLRA does not violate the plaintiffs' equal protection rights.  See also Douoan,\n129 F.3d at 1427; Gavin. 122 F.3d at 1089-90; Inmates of Suffolk County Jail. 129 F.3d\nat 659-61; Plvler v. Moore. 100 F.3d 365, 373-74 (4th Cir. 1996).\nm.  MOTIONS FOR  CONTEMPT\nHaving concluded that the termination provisions of the PLRA at issue are\nconstitutional, the next question for the Court is what effect a finding of contempt will\nhave on defendants' Motion to Terminate.  Plaintiffs contend that regardless of the\nconstitutionality of the termination provisions, if the Court finds defendants in contempt,\nit may stay defendants Motion to Terminate or hold it in abeyance until the contempt is\npurged.  The Court may do so, plaintiffs argue, either pursuant to its inherent contempt\npower or through the equitable doctrine of \"unclean hands.\"19\n\"[I]t is firmly established that '[t]he power to punish for contempt is inherent in\nall courts.'  [Ex Parte Robinson. 19 Wall. 505, 510 (1874)]. This power reaches both\nconduct before the court and that beyond the court's confines, for '[t]he underlying\nconcern that gave rise to the contempt power was not... merely the disruption of court\n19 The contempt motions involve civil, not criminar, contempt sanctions against defendants.  This\ndistinction is important, not only because imposition of criminal, as opposed to civil, sanctions entails\ndifferent procedural safeguards, but because the scope ofllic Court's power to order sanctions also differs\ndepending on which type of contempt is found by the Court.\n\nproceedings.  Rather, it was disobedience to the orders of the Judiciary, regardless of\nwhether such disobedience interfered with the conduct of trial.'\" Chambers v. NASCO.\nInc., 501 U.S. 32,44 (1991) (quoting Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S!A..\n481 U.S. 787, 798 (1987)).  This inherent contempt power is not unlimited, however.\nIndeed, \"[bjecause of their very potency, inherent powers must be exercised with restraint\nand discretion.\"  Id, (citing Roadway Express. Inc. v. Piper. 447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980)).\nMoreover, although the power to hold one in contempt is exercised at a court's discretion,\nit is not exercised absent standards.\nThe Third Circuit recently enunciated an important limit on the imposition of civil\ncontempt sanctions in Harris v. City of Philadelphia. 47 F.3d 1311 (3d Cir. 1995).\nUnhappy with overcrowding at a Philadelphia prison, a group of inmates filed a civil\nrights complaint in 1982, alleging that prison conditions violated various provisions of\nthe United States Constitution.  In 1986, the suit was expanded to include the entire\nPhiladelphia prison system.  Later that year, the inmates entered into a settlement\nagreement with the City in which the City agreed to construct new prisons and to do so\naccording to a specified schedule.  This agreement was approved by the court in the form\nof a consent decree that same year.  A second consent decree was approved by the Court\nin 1991, after it became clear that the conditions of the 1986 decree were not going to be\nmet, and a further amendment was stipulated in 1992. The provisions of the 1991\nconsent decree and its amendment were at issue in Harris.\nIn Harris, the district court imposed civil contempt sanctions; the sanctions arose\nout of the failure of the City to submit two planning documents by a specified date.\nWhen it failed to submit those documents, the district court sua sponte  found \"a pattern\n\nof contempt\" by the City, imposed fines and ordered the documents submitted.  After the\nCity again failed to submit the documents - having received an extension of time for\nsubmission of one of them -  the district court imposed a second contempt sanction.  This\nsecond sanction imposed by the court against the City was dismissal of its pending\nmotion to modify the consent decree.  For the reasons discussed below, the Third Circuit\nheld that this sanction exceeded the authority of the district court.\nThe plaintiffs cite Harris for the proposition that \"[a] party may not rely on its\nunilateral interpretation of the requirements for compliance in complex institutional\nreform litigation as an excuse for noncompliance,\" id. at 1325 (citation omitted), and\nargue that by amending the clothing regulations and review procedures, defendants have\ndone just that.  Defendants note, however, that Harris also stands for the proposition that\ncivil contempt sanctions must exert a coercive, rather than punitive, effect.  Thus, \"[i]f\nthe contemnor cannot purge through an affirmative act, the sanction has no coercive\neffect and exceeds the appropriate bounds of civil contempt.\"  Id. at 1328.  Although civil\ncontempt can also serve to compensate, the Third Circuit in Harris found that dismissal of\nthe motion to modify was neither coercive nor compensatory and instead was purely\npunitive, an inappropriate basis upon which to issue a sanction for civil contempt.  See\nalso Robin Woods Inc. v. Woods. 28 F.3d 396, 400 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"Sanctions for civil\ncontempt serve two purposes: 'to coerce the defendant into compliance with the court's\norder and to compensate for losses sustained by the disobedience.'\" (quoting McDonald's\nCorp. v. Victory Investments. 727 F.2d 82, 87 (3d Cir. 1984))); Gregory v. Depte. 896\nF.2d 31, 34 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"We first consider whether this contempt sanction may be\njustified as civil.  Such a sanction must coerce or compensate.\").\n\nPlaintiffs seek to have defendants ordered into compliance with the terms of the\nConsent Decree.  In doing so, they maintain that the Court may either dismiss defendants1\nMotion to Terminate, or hold that Motion in abeyance until defendants purge their\ncontempt.  It is clear, however, that should this Court find defendants in contempt, it may\nnot sanction them unless the sanction is capable of either coercing compliance, or of\ncompensating plaintiffs for past violations.  Defendants argue that Harrig is precisely on\npoint on this issue.  Ordering their Motion to Terminate dismissed or held in abeyance,\nthey argue, would impose a sanction which is purely punitive.\nThe Third Circuit in Harris concluded that the sanction of dismissing the motion\nto modify was not \"designed to have a coercive effect impelling the City to submit at\nlong last the tardy [documents]..., because it had no provision explicitly permitting the\nCity to refile the motion once the documents were submitted.\"  Harris. 47 F.3d at 1329.\nThe court apparently, therefore, left open the possibility that had the dismissal of the\nmotion to modify been without prejudice - allowing the City to re-file after complying\nwith the order - the sanction would have had a coercive effect and thus would have fit\nwithin the framework of civil contempt.  If so, it might be argued that in this case,\nholding defendants' Motion to Terminate in abeyance, or dismissing it without prejudice,\nwould have a coercive effect since defendants would be able to seek termination of the\nConsent Decree under the PLRA, after coming into compliance.\nWhile at first blush, this argument seems plausible, the Court must reject it.  The\npower to hold one in contempt is an equitable one and as such, \"where the purpose is to\nmake the defendant comply, the [court]... must then consider the character and\nmagnitude of the harm threatened by continued contumacy, and the probable\n\neffectiveness of any.suggested sanction in bringing about the result desired.\" United\nStates v. United Mine Workers of America. 330 U.S. 258,304 (1947).  In other words,\nthere must be a balancing of the equities.\nKeeping in mind first, that the Court has found the termination provisions of the\nPLRA to be constitutional, and second, that plaintiffs have not attempted to establish the\nfacts necessary to meet the standard which would permit the Court to deny defendants'\nMotion to Terminate, the Court concludes that requiring defendants to comply with the\nterms of the Consent Decree at this time would be little more than an empty gesture.\nAccepting, arguendo,  plaintiffs' position, and considering the Court's conclusion\nregarding the PLRA's constitutionality, as soon as defendants came into compliance, the\nDecree would lose all force in federal court under the terms of an order entered pursuant\nto the termination provisions of the PLRA. Thus, such an action on the part of the Court\nwould not only be a Pyrrhic victory for plaintiffs, it would, in practice, be a punishment\nof the defendants: the effect would merely be to'temporarily force defendants into a\npossibly costly compliance with rules and procedures they will immediately thereafter be\nin a position to abandon or restructure.  This neither aids plaintiffs, nor compels\ndefendants, and the Court will not order it.\nIn this respect, the Third Circuit's opinion in Latrobe Steel Co. v. United\nSteelworkers. 545 F.2d  1336 (1976), is instructive.  In that case, the district court had\nissued an injunction prohibiting a union from refusing to cross a \"stranger picket line.\"\nWhen union members failed to comply with the order, the district court sanctioned the\nunion in the form of fines payable tothe United States.  On appeal, the circuit court found\nthat the district court lacked jurisdiction to issue the underlying injunction.  The question\n\nthen became whether a contempt sanction can survive the invalidation of the order the\ncontemnors were charged with violating.- After concluding that the ordered sanction was\ncivil in nature, and that the purpose of the civil sanction was to coerce compliance with\nthe order the court concluded that \"coercive contempt cannot survive the overturning of\nthe underlying injunctive order  \" Id, at 1348.\nMoreover, there is precedent for refusing to impose a coercive contempt sanction\nwhen a change in law invalidates a court order, even where the alleged contemnor has\nflagrantly ignored that order.  In Wheeling Bridge (discussed above) the Supreme Court\nrefused both to enjoin reconstruction of the bridge and to sanction the bridge builders for\ntheir disobedience of the lower court order enjoining reconstruction:\nA motion is now made for attachments against the persons mentioned for\nthis disobedience and contempt.\nA majority of the court are of opinion, inasmuch as we have arrived at the\nconclusion that the act of congress afforded full authority to the\ndefendants to reconstruct the bridge, and the decree directing its alteration\nor abatement could not, therefore, be carried into execution after the\nenactment of this law, and inasmuch as the granting of an attachment for\nthe disobedience is a question resting in the discretion of the court, that,\nunder all the circumstances of the case, the motion should be denied.\nIdat436.20\ni\nA somewhat different issue is raised with respect to plaintiffs request for\ncompensatory sanctions for violation of the clothing provisions of the Consent Decree.\nThe Latrobe Steel court explains that:\n:0 Harris, plaintiffs contend, is inapposite becnusc, although the sanction of dismissing the motion to\nmodify was deemed to be inappropriate, the City in that case continued to remain obliged to produce die\ndocuments at issue. Here, in contrast, their argument continues, granting defendants' Motion to Terminate,\nwithout holding them in contempt, will relieve defendants of all their current obligations. Tluil is true but\nin this case, unlike in Hams, the underlying decree is being invalidated. Thus, the situation in the instant\nmatter is like lhnt in Whcclinu Briduc and, like ihe Wheeling Briduc Court, this Court will not find\ndefendants in contempt.\n\nAlthough the cases do. not fully explicate the reasoning behind the general -\nprinciple that compensatory civil contempt does not survive the abrogation\nof the underlying decree, the precept is, in our opinion, a sound one. A\ncompensatory contempt proceeding is similar in several particulars to an\nordinary damage action, since it is in essence an action between private\nparties, with rights created by the injunctive order rather than by a statute\nor the common law. The invalidation of an injunction in such a setting is\nequivalent to a holding that the plaintiff never had a legally cognizable\ninterest which the defendant was obliged to respect, a conclusion which\nshould be distinguished from the nearly unconditional duty of obedience\n,  owed by a defendant to a court. The United Mine Workers' doctrine thus\nrecognizes that a private party should not profit as a result of an order to\nwhich a court determines, in retrospect, he was never entitled.\nLatrobe Steel. 545 F.2d at 1345-46.  In this case, unlike Latrobe Steel, the Court will\nmerely terminate the prospective effect of the Consent Decree; it is not finding that \"the\nplaintiffs] never had a legally cognizable interest\" in the Decree.  Thus, Latrobe Steel\ndoes not answer the issue presented by plaintiffs' request for compensatory sanctions: the\nquestion of whether, if, by violating the clothing provisions of the Decree, defendants\nhave deprived plaintiffs of a right, plaintiffs are entitled to compensation by reason of the\nloss of that right even if the Decree is thereafter terminated. Neither can the Court rely\non Hanjs to find that imposition of compensatory sanctions would be a form of\npunishment - compensatory damages, by their very nature, are not punitive.  The Court\nwill therefore make findings with respect to plaintiffs' claim that they are entitled to\ncompensation by reason of the amendments to the clothing regulations unilaterally\nimposed on them by defendants in violation of the Consent Decree.\nThe Consent Decree provides that \"[defendants shall permit residents to wear\ncivilian clothing when the residents are housed in general population except to the extent\nthat the superintendent of each institution requires institutional issue to be worn for work.\nHowever, defendants reserve the right to require residents to wear specific articles of\n\nclothing, issued solely for the purpose of visitation during a resident's presence in the\nvisiting areas of the institution.  Furthermore, defendants reserve the right to impose\nreasonable regulations with respect to civilian clothing on the basis of safety, sanitary and\nsecurity considerations,\"  Consent Decree ^j XVII (emphasis added).\nDefendants have presented evidence that, after the escape of six inmates, they\namended the clothing regulations out of a concern for the safety of the public and security\nof correctional institutions.  Plaintiffs argue that this concern was not a primary\nmotivating factor for the change in regulation.  A report released by Commissioner Horn\ndetailed \"Primary Causes of Escape\" and \"security lapses that allowed escape.\"  The ...\nparties have stipulated that \"[t]he issue of inmate access to civilian clothing is listed only\nthereafter in the report as a concern related to the escape.\" Stipulation of Uncontested\nFact at iJ 14. Defendants cite this security concern as a principal reason for the change in\nclothing policy.  .\nThe Consent Decree does not require that safety and security concerns be the sole\nor even primary motivating factor.  It expressly reserves to defendants the right to alter\nclothing regulations if the alteration is \"reasonable\" and the concern for safety or security\nis a \"basis\" of the alteration.  See id at ffl| 9-14 (detailing Report of Commissioner Horn\non escape of prisoners).  In this case, the fact that inmates' possession of civilian clothing\ncontributed to the escape is ample proof that the defendants' safety and security concerns\nare \"reasonable.\"  The Court further finds that those concerns served as one of the bases\nfor the amendment to the clothing regulations.  The Court therefore concludes that\ndefendants have not violated the Consent Decree with respect to the amended clothing\nregulations and will not order compensatory sanctions.\n\nIn light of the Court's earlier conclusion - that even had defendants violated other\nprovisions of the Consent Decree it will not hold them in contempt for the purpose of\nmaking them comply with those provisions of the Decree - the Court will not make\nfindings as to whether defendants have violated any other provisions of the Consent\nDecree or its amendments.21  Although the Consent Decree has not yet been terminated,\nabsent a finding of a \"current and ongoing\" violation of a federal right - which  plaintiffs\nhave expressly declined to attempt to establish - the Court must promptly terminate the\nDecree.\nIV.  APPLICATION OF THE EQUITABLE DOCTRINE OF \"UNCLEAN\nHANDS\"\nRelying on their contentions with respect to defendants' contempt,  plaintiffs\nassert that defendants are invoking the termination provisions of the PLRA with \"unclean\nhands.\" Thus, even if the Court will not order contempt sanctions in this case, the\nquestion remains whether defendants may be barred, under the doctrine of \"unclean\nhands\" - from seeking the equitable relief of termination of the Consent Decree pursuant\nto the PLRA's termination provisions.  A court acts out of concern for its own integrity\nwhen it refuses to hear a claim because the party seeking relief enters with \"unclean\nhands.\" See Gaudiosi v. Mellon. 269 F.2d 873, 881-882 (3d Cir.1959).  To succeed with\nthe defense of \"unclean hands,\" the conduct of the party seeking relief must be\n21 The Court's conclusion that it need not reach the issue of whether or not the defendants violated\nprovisions of the Consent Decree or its Amendments moots a number of subsidiary issues, such as whether\nthe body of Magistrate Judge Hall's Report and Recommendation was incorporated into the 1983\nAmendment to Stipulation and the proper interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d) in the\ncoiUcxt of this case.  For-thc samcTcasons the Court declines to reach the question of whether defendants\narc in contempt, it will not reach the merits of these subsidiary issues, although it commends the parlies on\ntheir thorough and able briefing and argument on these issues.\n\ninequitable and must involve the subject matter of his or her claim.  See Ciba-Geigy\nCorp. v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.. Inc.. 747 F.2d 844, 855 (3d Cir.1984). \"What is\nmaterial is not that the plaintiffs hands are dirty, but that he dirtied them in acquiring the\nright he now asserts, or that the manner of dirtying renders inequitable the assertion of\nsuch rights against the defendant.\"  Carney v. School District of Philadelphia, 633\nF.Supp. 1273, 1285 (E.D. Pa. 1986). This doctrine has been defined  as barring a claim\n\"only if '(1) a party seeking affirmative relief (2) is guilty of conduct involving  fraud,\ndeceit, unconscionability, or bad faith (3) directly related to the matter in issue (4) that\ninjures the other party and (5) affects the balance of equities between the litigants.'\" Tanu\nv. Hwang. 799 F.Supp. 499, 505 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (quoting Castle v. Cohen. 676 F.Supp.\n620, 627 (E.D. Pa. 1987), affd  in part and remanded in part on other grounds. 840 F.2d\n173 (3d Cir. 1988)).\nFederal courts clearly retain broad equitable powers under the doctrine of\n\"unclean hands.\"  See, e^, Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance\nMachinery Co.. 324 U.S. 806, 814-15 (1945) (\"The guiding doctrine in this case is the\nequitable maxim that 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands.' . .. This\nmaxim necessarily gives wide range to the equity court's use of discretion in refusing to\naid the unclean litigant.\") (affirming dismissal of patent suit in which plaintiff entered\ncourt with \"unclean hands\").  A court may exercise those powers in many circumstances,\neven in cases in which a party is proceeding under statute.  Of course, the requirement\nremains that the misconduct alleged by those invoking \"unclean hands1' must relate to the\nsubject matter of the statute at issue.  SeeToomerv. Witsell. 334 U.S. 385, 393 (1948.).\n\nIn the context of congressionally created injunctive remedies, the Supreme Court\nhas said that \"[u]nless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable\ninference, restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to\nbe recognized and applied.\"  Porter v. Warner Holding Co.. 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946)\n(absent a \"clear and valid legislative command\" courts retain their powers of equity).  See\nalso Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo. 456 U.S. 305 (1982). Courts may, nonetheless, be\nbarred by statute from exercising some or all of their equitable powers. See, e.g.,\nOperating Engineers Local Union 3 v. Burroughs. 417 F.2d 370 (9lh Cir. 1969) (holding\nthat \"unclean hands\" defense was not available where union employee sought relief under\nfederal statute but had failed to exhaust union remedies); United States v. Martell. 844\nF.Supp. 454 (N.D. Ind. 1994) (holding that doctrine of \"unclean hands\" does not apply\nwhen proceeding under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and\nLiability Act (\"CERCLA\") because the \"unclean hands\" doctrine cannot be used to\nfrustrate the law or public policy).  The Third Circuit has also been reluctant to find an\n\"unclean hands\" exception in statutes. Thus, when the government argued that there was\nan implied \"unclean hands\" exception to the statute prohibiting introduction of\nunlawfully obtained .wire tap. evidence to the grand jury, the Third Circuit held that no\nsuch exception applied.  See In re Grand Jury. Ill F.3d 1066, 1077 (3d Cir. 1997); see\nalso Smith Land & Improvement Corp.' v. Celotex Corp.. 851 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 1988)\n(holding that \"doctrines such as caveat emptor and 'clean hands,' which in some cases\ncould bar relief regardless of the degree of culpability of the parties, do not comport with\ncongressional objectives\" as codified in CERCLA and thus do not apply under that\nstatute).\n\nThe Supreme Court has also recently spoken to this issue.  In McKennon v.\nNashville Banner Pub. Co.. 513 U.S. 352 (1995), the plaintiff, Christine McKennon,\nsought a remedy under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), a. statute\nwhich explicitly provides that a court has discretion to \"grant such legal or equitable\nrelief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purpose of [the Act].\"  29 U.S.C. § 626(b).\nAfter firing her for purportedly illegitimate reasons, her former employer discovered that\nMcKennon had engaged in conduct that would have provided legitimate grounds for\ndismissal.22  This evidence, they claimed, barred her from proceeding under the ADEA, a\nform of \"unclean hands\".\nThe Supreme Court in McKennon held that the reason the employer had initially\ngiven for firing McKennon was in violation of the ADEA. It then went on to refuse\nconsideration of the \"unclean hands\" doctrine: \"Equity's maxim that a suitor who\nengaged in his own reprehensible conduct in the course of the transaction at issue must be\ndenied equitable relief because of \"unclean hands\", a rule which in conventional\nformulation operated in limine to bar the suitor from seeking the aid of the equity court,.\n.. has not been applied where Congress authorizes broad equitable relief to serve\nimportant national policies.\"  Id. at 360 (emphasis added). Thus the Court has \"rejected\nthe unclean hands defense 'where a private suit serves important public purposes.'\" Id.\n(quoting Perma Life Mufflers. Inc. v. International Parts Corp.. 392 U.S. 134, 138 (1963)\n(holding that \"unclean hands\" defense does not apply in Sherman Act and Clayton Act\nAntitrust actions)); see also Pan-American Petroleum & Transport Co. v. United States.\nK Plaintiff McKennon admitted during a deposition tliat in her last year of employment, she had copied .\nseveral of her employer's confidential documents.  While the Supreme Court held tkit this evidence did not\nbar her ADEA claim, it was nonetheless relevant to the question of damages.\n\n273 U.S. 456 (1927) (rules of equity \"will not be applied so as to frustrate purpose of\nlaws or thwart public policy\").  .  .\nThe PLRA serves important national policies, and because barring defendants'\nMotion to Terminate under the doctrine of \"unclean hands\" would serve to frustrate the\npurpose of the law and thwart public policy, the Court concludes that plaintiffs may not\ninvoke the \"unclean hands\" doctrine to bar defendants' Motion to Terminate.\nV.  RELIEF\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3), a court should not terminate relief if it finds that\nthere is a \"current and ongoing violation of the Federal right\" and that the relief is\nnarrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary and is the least intrusive means\npossible to correct the violation.  The statute clearly defines prospective relief as \"all\nrelief other than compensatory monetary damages,\" id. § 3626(g)(7) and relief is further\ndefined to include \"consent decrees.\" Id. § 3626(g)(9). In combination with the\nlegislative history discussed above, the Court concludes that the statute is unambiguous:\npursuant to the PLRA, consent decrees are to be \"terminated\" upon motion unless there is\na showing of \"current and ongoing violations\" of a federal right.\nBecause the Court has determined that the termination provisions of the P. LRA are\nconstitutional, because it has denied the contempt motions, and because it will not bar\ndefendants' Motion to Terminate under the doctrine of \"unclean hands,\" the Court will\nterminate the Consent Decree under the provisions of the PLRA.\nIn applying these provisions, the Court will follow the literal language of the\nstatute and \"terminate\" the decree, not vacate it. The Second Circuit in Benjamin v,\n\nJacobson. 124 F.3d 162 (2dCir. 1997), reh^ held en bane February 25, 1998,23aftera\ncomplicated analysis of the language of the PLRA, chose to read § 3626 of the Act such\nthat \"the statutory definition of relief, which includes consent decrees, should  preferably\nbe read to mean that it includes remedies arising out of or issued pursuant to the consent\n•decree,\" but not the consent decree itself. 14 at 168. The.consequence of this\ninterpretation is that the obligations and agreements under the consent decree are left\nintact, even when the relief ordered by the decree is terminated.  Otherwise stated, the\nBenjamin court held that the PLRA merely strips federal court of jurisdiction over non-\nfederal remedies.  With this understanding of the termination provisions, the court in -\nBenjamin proceeded to find the PLRA constitutional, noting, however, in several\ninstances that that conclusion was \"predicated on our interpretation of the termination\nprovision as limiting federal jurisdiction over the non-federal aspects of the Consent\nDecrees rather than as making those aspects of the Decrees void.\"  Id. at 170.\nWhile the Court does not adopt this interpretation of the PLRA's termination\nprovisions, \"Congress chose to use the verb 'terminate1 and to eschew the verb 'vacate.'\nThe distinction between these two words is clear: 'terminate' means 'to put an end to' or\n'to end,' Black's Law Dictionary at 1471, whereas 'vacate' means 'to annul' or 'to render\n... void,' id at 1548.\" Inmates of Suffolk County Jail. 129 F.3d at 662. As the First\nCircuit has noted, \"this distinction may well possess practical significance.\"  id.; see also\nBenjamin. 124 F.3d at 178-79.  While terminating the Consent Decree ends its future\n2J The Court notes that the Second Circuit grunted rehearing en bnnc in Benjamin; the rehearing was held\non February 25, 1998 and the Second Circuit has not yet issued an opinion.\n\ninjunctive effect, the decree itself is not \"annulled,\" as it would be if it were vacated.  The\nCourt will therefore, as it has said, \"terminate\" and not \"vacate\" the Decree.\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Court must turn to plaintiffs'  alternative\nrequests: to have this Court \"certify\" transfer to the Commonwealth Court and \"not divest\njurisdiction\" pending any action in state court. This latter request will be treated as one\nto stay implementation of the termination order. Plaintiffs seek to have this case\ntransferred so as to give them an opportunity to attempt to enforce the Consent Decree\nunder state law, free of the termination requirement of the PLRA.  Plaintiffs point to no\nstatute or rule which would authorize this Court to \"certify\" such a transfer and it\ndeclines to do so. Nonetheless, the Court recognizes that plaintiffs may have valid\narguments that the Consent Decree creates binding obligations under state law -  although\nit expresses no opinion as to the merits of such arguments. It will therefore examine the\nquestion of whether the Court should stay termination of the Decree pending either state\ncourt action or appeal of this decision.\nAfter engaging in the analysis outlined above, the Second Circuit in Benjamin\nconcluded that it was appropriate to maintain a stay, keeping the consent decree at issue\nin that case in force.  Mindful that the issues at stake in the litigation before it had closely\ndivided those courts which had addressed them, the Second Circuit ordered the stay\nmaintained \"until the Supreme Court has acted on any possible petition for certiorari.\"\nId. at 180.  Although in one respect this Court reaches an outcome not too dissimilar from\nthat of the Second Circuit, the Court must respectfully disagree with this part of the\nSecond Circuit's holding and will not order a stay in this case.  Because the statute is.\n\nunambiguous on this point and the Court has concluded that the termination provisions of\nthe PLRA are constitutional, the Court will not stay termination of the Decree.\nVI.  CONCLUSION\nBased on all of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the termination provisions\nof the PLRA are constitutional and therefore grants defendants their requested relief.  The\nConsent Decree will be terminated.  The Court also has determined that  plaintiffs'\ncontempt motions should be denied.  Plaintiffs have requested two types of contempt\nsanctions and the reasons for denying their motions is likewise twofold: with respect to\nthe request for coercive sanctions, the Court has concluded that in the circumstances of\nthis case, such sanctions would be punitive in nature and thus will not impose coercive\nsanction regardless of whether defendants have violated provisions of the Consent\nDecree; with respect to the request for compensatory sanctions arising from  defendants'\namendment of the clothing regulations, the same reasoning does not apply and the Court\ntherefore found that the amendments to the clothing regulations did not violate the\nConsent Decree.  The Court additionally declines to bar defendants' Motion to Terminate\nbased on the equitable doctrineof \"unclean hands.\" Finally, the Court will neither stay\ntermination in this case, n.or order the case transferred to the Commonwealth Court.\nAn appropriate order follows.",

Pennsylvania.\nJune 7, 1978.\n894 *894 Jack J. Levine, Alan B. Rubenstein, Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiffs.\nBenjamin Lerner, Philadelphia, Pa., for defendants.\nOPINION\nJOSEPH S. LORD, III, Chief Judge.\nPlaintiffs, twenty-one individual prisoners and an unincorporated association of prisoners of the Commonwealth\n[1]\nof Pennsylvania incarcerated at six state penitentiaries, brought this class action in 1970.  Plaintiffs represent a\nclass comprising all persons who are now or will be incarcerated in the Pennsylvania State Correctional\nInstitutions at Graterford, Dallas, Huntingdon, Muncy, Rockview and Pittsburgh. Defendants are elected and\nappointed officials of the Commonwealth and its prison system. The complaint attacks conditions and policies at\neach of the prisons as being violative of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982, 1983, and 1988 as well as the First, Fifth, Sixth,\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §\n1343.\nMost of the issues raised in the complaint are the subject matter of a consent decree entered into by the parties\nand approved by me on May 22, 1978. However, two areas of contention were omitted from settlement and\ninstead have been litigated. These complaints involve the constitutionality of conditions in the maximum security\ncell blocks at four state penitentiaries and of the prohibition in all the institutions against conjugal visits. We\nvisited the four cell blocks in question in August 1974 and again in August 1975. We reserved ruling on these two\nissues, pending our decision to approve the consent decree.\nWe conclude that the conditions in the maximum security areas at Graterford, Dallas and Muncy do not constitute\ncruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. However, the three cells at\nHuntingdon known as the \"Glass Cage\" are constitutionally unacceptable and must be closed. We also conclude\nthat the prohibition against sexual visitation at each of the state institutions does not offend the Constitution.\n895 *895 In determining the constitutionality of prison conditions, federal courts must allow state penal officials broad\nlatitude in determining how to administer and regulate the prison environment in light of recognized penological\ngoals of deterrence, rehabilitation and institutional security. Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.,\n433 U.S. 119, 125-126, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 2538-2539, 53 L.Ed.2d 629, 638-39 (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S.\n817, 822-26, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404-05, 94 S.Ct. 1800,\n40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). The court cannot dictate to state officials the conditions which the court may feel, as a\nmatter of enlightened and advanced prison theory, should prevail in state penitentiaries. See Knuckles v. Prasse,\n302 F.Supp. 1036, 1048 (E.D.Pa.1969),aff'd,435 F.2d 1255 (3d Cir. 1970),cert. denied,403 U.S. 936, 91 S.Ct.\n2262, 29 L.Ed.2d 717 (1971). However, \"judicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cognizance of\nvalid constitutional claims,\" Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 405, 94 S.Ct. at 1807, and therefore the court\nshould not hesitate to remedy conditions which amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe Eighth Amendment defies precise definition because it \"must draw its meaning from the evolving standards\nof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2\n\nL.Ed.2d 630 (1958). In the context of prison conditions there are three criteria of the Eighth Amendment which\nmight be applied. If an inmate can demonstrate that penal conditions violate any one of these tests, the condition\nmust be invalidated.\nThe first criterion is the classic standard that penal conditions are proscribed which violate \"the dignity of man\", \nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. at 100, 78 S.Ct. 590; Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272, 280 (3d Cir. 1972), that is\nconditions which are \"so barbarous that [they offend] society's evolving sense of decency\", Nadeau v. Helgemoe,\n561 F.2d 411, 413 (1st Cir. 1977), which involve \"physical and mental abuse or corporal punishment of such\nbase, inhumane, and barbaric proportions so as to shock and offend a court's sensibilities,\" Burns v. Swenson,\n430 F.2d 771, 778 (8th Cir. 1970),cert. denied,404 U.S. 1062, 92 S.Ct. 743, 30 L.Ed.2d 751 (1972), or which\ninvolve \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\" Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50\nL.Ed.2d 251 (1976).\nThe second criterion is that punishment which is grossly disproportionate to the offense which precipitated that\nsanction is violative of the Eighth Amendment. Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 368, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54\nL.Ed. 793 (1910). This test has been applied in challenges to the type of punishment imposed, Gregg v. Georgia,\n428 U.S. 153, 173, 187, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (death penalty); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. at 100,\n78 S.Ct. 590 (denationalization); and to the duration or conditions of punishment, Downey v. Perini, 518 F.2d\n1288, 1290 (6th Cir.),vacated,423 U.S. 993, 96 S.Ct. 419, 46 L.Ed.2d 367 (1975); O'Brien v. Moriarty, 489 F.2d\n941, 944 (1st Cir. 1974) (duration of solitary confinement); Hart v. Coiner, 483 F.2d 136, 139-43 (4th Cir. 1973),\ncert. denied,415 U.S. 938, 94 S.Ct. 1454, 39 L.Ed.2d 495,rehearing denied,416 U.S. 916, 94 S.Ct. 1624, 40\nL.Ed.2d 118 (1974); LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974, 978 n. 6 (2d Cir. 1972),cert. denied,414 U.S. 878, 94\nS.Ct. 49, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973) (strip cell grossly severe for prison infraction).\nThe third criterion of the Eighth Amendment has evolved in more recent decisions and requires that punishment\nmust not go beyond legitimate penal objectives, i. e., the punishment must bear a rational relationship to the\naccomplishment of penological goals which are of sufficient importance to justify its severity. See Owens-El v.\nRobinson, 442 F.Supp. 1368, 1384-85 (W.D.Pa.1978); Inmates, D. C. Jail v. Jackson, 416 F.Supp. 119, 122\n(D.D.C.1976); Padgett v. Stein, 406 F.Supp. 287, 293 (M.D. Pa.1975); Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F.Supp. 674, 679\n(N.D.Cal.1966). The Third Circuit has adopted an analogous position in Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272 (3d Cir.\n1972), in which the court stated:\n896 *896 \"A punishment may be cruel and unusual when, although applied in pursuit of a legitimate\npenal aim, it goes beyond what is necessary to achieve that aim; that is, when a punishment is\nunnecessarily cruel in view of the purpose for which it is used.\" Id. at 281, quoting from Jordan v.\nFitzharris, 257 F.Supp. at 679.\nAt least five members of the Supreme Court recently have accepted the \"penological objectives\" criterion. In \nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), Justice Stewart stated in a plurality\nopinion joined by Justices Powell and Stevens that in order to satisfy the Eighth Amendment \"the sanction\nimposed cannot be so totally without penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering.\" \nId. at 183, 96 S.Ct. at 2929. Justices Brennan and Marshall similarly have approved the penological objectives\nstandard in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). See408 U.S. at 279-80, 92\nS.Ct. 2726 (Brennan, J., concurring); 408 U.S. at 331-33, 92 S.Ct. 2726 (Marshall, J., concurring). This test has\nbeen applied to a denial of medical treatment in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 103, 97 S.Ct. at 290, where the\nCourt said, \"denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering which no one suggests would serve any\npenological purpose.\"\nI. Solitary Confinement.\nEighth Amendment challenges to the conditions of solitary confinement frequently have been made. It is clear\nthat such confinement is not per se violative of the Eighth Amendment. United States ex rel. Tyrrell v. Speaker,\n471 F.2d 1197, 1202 (3d Cir. 1973). However, confinement in which the isolation cells provided inadequate\nspace, heating, ventilation, lighting or sanitary conditions or where the inmates received inadequate items of\npersonal hygiene, food or clothing, has been declared to be cruel and unusual punishment. See, e. g., LaReau v.\n\nMacDougall, 473 F.2d at 978 (dark cell, inadequate sanitary conditions); Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 526\n(2d Cir. 1967) (inadequate clothing, heating and implements of personal hygiene); Owens-El v. Robinson, 442\nF.Supp. at 1384 (inadequate bedding, clothing and toilet articles); Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318, 327 (M.D.\nAla.1976),aff'd,559 F.2d 283 (5th Cir. 1977) (filth, overcrowding, inadequate food and exercise); Battle v.\nAnderson, 376 F.Supp. 402, 424 (E.D.Okl.1974),aff'd,564 F.2d 388 (10th Cir. 1977) (long-term idleness,\ninadequate exercise, work or educational programs). Where the challenge is made to the conditions of solitary\nconfinement, rather than to the criteria for assignment to segregation or the length of such confinement, the first\nand third criteria of the Eighth Amendment are the relevant standards to judge the constitutional claims made\nhere. With these two tests and the case law previously cited in mind, we will examine the conditions at each of\nthe institutions under consideration.\nA. State Correctional Institution at Graterford.\nThe maximum security cell block at Graterford Prison is known as the Behavior Adjustment Unit (\"BAU\"). It\nconsists of thirty-nine cells in a U-shaped building located approximately five hundred to six hundred feet from the\nmain building complex. Each cell in the BAU is approximately six feet wide, ten feet deep, and eight feet high,\nand is furnished with a bed, mattress, a sink and hopper combination (controlled by the inmate), sheets, and a\npillow. Only cold water is provided. The cells are windowless and have no interior lighting. However, there are\nwindows across the corridor from the cells as well as 150-watt light bulbs in front of the cells which illuminate the\ncells sufficiently for inmates to read. The cells are clean and have no unpleasant odors. Ventilation is adequate.\nInmates confined to the BAU have the same right to receive mail, legal materials, and publications as do those in\ngeneral population. They receive three showers a week and one hour of exercise a day. A doctor visits the BAU\n897 each day and a psychiatrist *897 is available at an inmate's request. Inmates in the BAU receive the same food\nas inmates in general population although occasionally in reduced portions.\nInmates are committed to the BAU by self-commitment, as transfers from other institutions' BAU's, or after a due-\nprocess hearing on charges of misconduct. Commitments to the BAU generally do not exceed thirty days, but\nthere are some long-term assignments.\n\"Death row\" cells consist of nine cells within the BAU. They are exactly like the other BAU cells except that they\nhave hot and cold water.\nWe conclude, based on the record at trial and our two visits, that use of the BAU at Graterford does not constitute\ncruel and unusual punishment. There is no question that the cells in the BAU are grim and cheerless.\nNonetheless, we conclude that these conditions are not so inhumane or base that they shock the court's\nconscience or violate standards of human decency. Similarly, we find that such confinement is rationally related\nto legitimate penal goals and thus meets constitutional standards.\nB. State Correctional Institution at Dallas.\nThe maximum security cell block at Dallas consists of two levels: the ground level block, known as S-1, and a\nlower level, known as the \"Annex\". S-1 comprises eighteen cells; the Annex contains eleven cells.\nThe S-1 cells have a separate toilet and sink, a bed, and a light inside the cell. An inmate is confined to S-1 only\nafter a hearing. Every seven days the inmate's confinement is reviewed by his counselor. Every thirty days a\ncommittee reviews the inmate's confinement with the inmate present.\nIn general, an inmate is sent to the Annex from S-1. Confinement there generally averages from one to four days,\nalthough in some cases assignment to the Annex has exceeded thirty days.\nThe cells in the Annex measure approximately five feet wide by nine feet deep by ten feet high. They have\nneither windows nor lights, but windows across from the cells and lights in the corridor provide sufficient lighting\nfor inmates to read. Ventilation is adequate. The cell block is clean and free from unpleasant odors. Inmates are\ngenerally allowed daily showers and are visited by a doctor each day. Inmates are generally, but not always,\n\nserved full rations of food. Daily exercise of up to two hours is allowed in the corridor outside the cell except when\nthe inmate is disruptive.\nAs with the BAU at Graterford, we must conclude that confinement in the S-1 and Annex cells at Dallas, although\ncertainly unpleasant, does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\nC. State Correctional Institution at Muncy.\nThe State Correctional Institution at Muncy, a women's prison, is an open institution; it has no walls, fences, or\nperimeter guards. The administrative and punitive segregation units of Muncy are housed in Clinton Cottage,\nwhich is located in a wooded area one-half mile from the main facilities. Clinton Cottage contains forty-eight cells\non two floors. The first floor contains nineteen cells, fourteen with single wooden doors used for administrative\nsegregation and four with double doors (one wooden, one barred) used for punitive segregation. The second\nfloor consists of twenty-nine cells, fourteen of which are double-doored and are used for punitive segregation.\nThe remaining second-floor cells are no longer used.\nEach cell is approximately twelve feet deep by eight feet wide by nine feet high and contains a bed, night table,\ntoilet, and sink. The lighting in the cell consists of a sixty-watt bulb. Except for inmates housed in the first-floor\npunitive segregation cells, inmates in Clinton Cottage are allowed all items in their cell permitted inmates in the\ngeneral population. Food portions are not reduced. Three showers are permitted each week. Clinton Cottage is\nclean and well-ventilated with no unpleasant odors.\n898 *898 Inmates in administrative segregation are allowed out of their cells for one-half of the day. However, those\nconfined to punitive segregation are not allowed out at all. Inmates in punitive segregation are confined generally\nfor from one to two weeks, with weekly review, although some inmates are kept for considerably longer periods.\nWe have no difficulty in concluding that conditions at Clinton Cottage, even for those inmates in punitive\nsegregation, do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\nD. State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon.\nThe maximum security area at Huntingdon contains 144 cells. The psychiatric quarters consist of seventeen\ncells. Three of these cells are known as the \"Glass Cage\" and provide the focus of the Huntingdon inmates'\nconstitutional attack. We conclude that use of the Glass Cage constitutes treatment so inhumane and degrading\nas to amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Its continued use cannot be tolerated.\nThe Glass Cage is enclosed by glass walls and a locked steel door. The cells measure approximately nine feet\ndeep by eight feet wide by nine feet high. There is no furniture, no window, and no inside lighting. Cells are\nequipped with a toilet and sink and are supposed to include a mattress, two sheets, a pillow, and blankets. We\nsaw none of these items during our visits, but the cells were not in use at that time. Outside lighting is totally\ninadequate for reading. In addition, despite use of a large fan, ventilation is insufficient. The cells are unclean and\nan unpleasant odor pervades.\nOur conclusion that the cells in the Glass Cage cannot remain in use is based in large part on our two visits to the\ninstitution. On each occasion we were genuinely shocked by the dark, dirty, and totally isolated conditions we\nobserved. We agree with plaintiffs that the continued existence of the Glass Cage constitutes a serious threat to\nthe physical and mental well-being of every resident who is confined there, and thus we conclude that\nconfinement in such conditions could serve no legitimate penological purpose.\nII. Conjugal Visits.\nPlaintiffs urge us to declare that the lack of facilities at each institution in which inmates may enjoy sexual\nvisitation with their spouses constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In support of this claim, plaintiffs\npresented an expert witness, Dr. Herbert Thomas, who testified that lack of conjugal visits is a factor which can\n\ncause an inmate to suffer physical, emotional, and psychological stress. The psychological regression which may\nresult can lead to homosexual behavior, violence, loss of selfidentity, and self-destructive behavior.\nPlaintiffs concede that there is no inherent constitutional right to engage in heterosexual relations in prison.\nHowever, they argue that the Eighth Amendment protects them from the deleterious effects which flow from\ndenial of sexual visitation rights. They distinguish cases which have held that denial of conjugal visits does not\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment, see, e. g., McCray v. Sullivan, 509 F.2d 1332, 1334 (5th Cir.),cert.\ndenied,423 U.S. 859, 96 S.Ct. 114, 46 L.Ed.2d 86 (1975); Lyons v. Gilligan, 382 F.Supp. 198, 201-03 (N.D.Ohio\n1974), by noting that the records in those cases lacked the expert testimony provided by plaintiffs.\nWe do not believe that Dr. Thomas' testimony justifies a departure from those decisions upholding the denial of\nsexual visitation against constitutional attack. See United States ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi, 439 F.Supp. 114, 142-43\n(S.D.N.Y.1977),aff'd573 F.2d 118 (2 Cir.1978) (and cases cited therein). Dr. Thomas testified that psychological\nregression in inmates results from many factors. Foremost among these causes, according to Dr. Thomas, is not\ndenial of sexual visitation, but instead, lengthy sentences resulting in long terms of incarceration. Consequently,\nwe find that the denial of sexual visitation itself does not cause severe mental or physical deterioration.\n899 *899 It is clear that not all conditions of confinement which have an adverse effect on a prisoner are\nconstitutionally proscribed. In Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. at 822-23, 94 S.Ct. 2800, the Court stated that one of\nthe essential functions of incarceration is the isolation of the inmate from society, which is intended to be an\nundesirable condition so as to deter potential criminals from committing crimes.\nThe restriction challenged here and its effects on inmates do not violate any of the three Eighth Amendment\ncriteria. See Part I, supra. It is obvious that the first two tests of unconstitutionality have not been met. The\nessence of penal confinement is isolation from society, including limitations on physical and social interactions.\nWe conclude that the prohibition on sexual visitation is not so inhuman that it shocks the conscience and that it is\nnot disproportionate punishment. A closer question is whether such a restriction is rationally related to a\nlegitimate penological goal. We agree with Judge Frankel's opinion in United States ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi, 439\nF.Supp. at 143, that there is a division of penological opinion on the advisability of conjugal visitation and that the\njudiciary is ill-equipped to resolve this complex policy question. However, since there is ample support for the\nproposition that a restriction on sexual visitation is rationally related to legitimate penal concerns for institutional\nsecurity and the deterrence value of incarceration, I conclude that such a prohibition must be sustained under the\nEighth Amendment.\n[1] Several other suits brought by state prisoners have been consolidated with this original action (C.A. #\n70-3054) and have been resolved by the Consent Decree or tried in this adjudication.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

NOS. 70-3054  ' FILED TO\n71-513\n71-1006\n70-2545\nREPORT AND  RECOMMENDATION\nImprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp\nWILLIAM F. HALL,  JR.\nUNITED STATES  MAGISTRATE\n• •  ••  ••  •• ••  •  •  ••  ••  •• • •  •••  •• ••••••  ••\nPC-PA-005-008\nNow before  the court is the defendants' motion for the approval of a stipulation\nfor  dismissal  of  outstanding  allegations  of  contempt  and  for  dismissal  of  the  plaintiffs\nmotion for contempt.  The stipulation for dismissal contains terms of a settlement  between\nthe parties which has been signed by counsel for the plaintiff-class  and for the  defendants.\nFor the reasons that follow, I recommend that the motion be granted.\nThis action represents the consolidation of several individual civil rights actions\nbrought by inmates in Pennsylvania correctional institutions and was brought pursuant  to 42\nU.S.C.  §1982,  19S3  and  1988  as  well  as  the  First,  Fifth,  Sixth,  Eighth  and  Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States  Constitution.  Upon consolidation,  a class was  certified\nwhich consisted of all inmates .then confined  and all inmates to be confined in the future  in\nthe state correctional Institutions at Dallas, Graterford,  Huntingdon, Muncy, Pittsburgh  and\nRockview.  On  May  22,  1978  the  ection  was  terminated  by  a  consent  decree  '(Consent\nDecree).  Since that  time the plaintiffs  have filed a motion for  the issuance of an order  to\nshow cause why the defendants should not be held in contempt for violations of the  Consent\nCLERK  QE.COU.RI\n\nDecree.  In  addition  to  the  motion  for  issuance  of an  order  to show  cause,  the  court  has\nreceived numerous letters  from  inmates in these  Institutions complaining that  the  Consent\nDecree  was being violated.  In addition,  many individual  civil rights complaints have  been\nbrought  by inmates  in which  the subject  matter  in eech  of  their  complaints  is  within  the\nscope of the Consent Decree.\nThe  negotiations  which  culminated  in  the  proposed  settlement  began  in  July,\n1980.  In March 1981, however, I was ordered by the court to determine the following issues:\nL  Whether violations of the Consent Decree are occurring; and\n2.  Whether  any  alleged  violations  are  individual  complaints  or  are  either\ninstitution-wide or state-wide.\nI  was  further  directed  to  prepare  a  report  and  recommendation  upon  the\nconclusion of of  whatever  proceedings I deemed  appropriate.  (Order  dated  March 31, 1981\nby  Chief  Judge,  Joseph  S.  Lord,  m).  In  complying  with  that  mandate,  I  referred  the\ninmates' letters  of  complaint  to  counsel  for  the  Bureau  of  Corrections  (Bureau)  and  held\nhearings in January, 1982 during which testimony was given by several inmates.  In addition,\naccompanied by counsel for  the Bureau, I visited Graterford,  Dallas and Huntingdon where I\ntalked  to  the  institutions'  officials  and  their  inmates.  During  the  process,  I  received\ndetailed reports of  the investigation  made by the Bureau  in the  cases of  the  more  serious\ncomplaints  referred  to  them.  Counsel  for  the Bureau  and  the institutions' officials  were\nextremely  cooperative  arid .diligently  investigated  the  complaints,  and  in some  instances\ntook corrective action even when a complaint  did not clearly fall within the purview of  the\nConsent Decree.  Counsel for  the  plaintiff-class  was advised  of  the complaints  made,  and\nreceived copies of the investigative reports.\nIn  the  main,  the  complaints  of  violations  of  the  Consent  Decree  made  by\nindividual  inmates  involved  disciplinary  proceedings,  cell  searches,  the  adequacy  of  the\n\nhealth  care  that  they  ere  provided,  and  the  physical  condition  of  the  institutions.  The\ncomplainants,  for  the  most  pert,  expressed  dissatisfaction  with  the  Inmate  Complaint\nSystem  (complaint  system)  presently  maintained  by  the  institutions.  The  results  of  my\ninvestigation  tend  to support  the  allegations  of deficiencies  in that  system.  Clearly,  the\nprisoners appear  to have no confidence  in its fairness or efficacy.  It should be noted here,\nhowever,  that  the Bureau's eighteen (18) month report  for  the period January 1980  through\nJune  30, 1981 reveals  a  total  number  of  complaints  processed  which  would  tax  the  most\nliberally  estimated  capacity  of  the  institutions.  The  inmates'  dissatisfaction  with  the\ncomplaint  system  and the institutions' performance  in administering  it  were,  in  my  view,\ncrucial,  for  the  unanswered,  or  inadequately  investigated  and  answered  responses  to  the\ncomplaints,  and,  of course, adverse  responses to  the  complaints,  have  undoubtedly  led  to\nthe  filing  of  civil rights actions  in this  and other  federal  courts, and have contributed  to\ntheir already burgeoning caseloads.  The testimony which I took in court and the  complaint\nletters received from  the inmates provide convincing evidence to support this conclusion.\nIn addressing the complaints stated in letters to the court claiming violations of\nthe Consent Decree, the determination  of whether  those complaints  were valid  could  only\nbe  made  through  an  inquiry such  as the  one I have been directed  to  make, because  there\nwere  no  procedural  steps  available  to  the  inmates  which  would  permit  a  prompt\ndetermination  of  the  validity  of  their  complaints  end  the  implementation  of  whatever\nremedies  might  be  warranted.  An obvious alternative  to  conducting  such  an  inquiry,  of\ncourse,  would  have  been  to  conduct  individual  hearings  to  determine,  first,  whether  the\ncomplaints fell within the purview of the Consent Decree, and then to determine  whether\n1.  Commonwealth  of Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction 18 Month Report, January 1, 1980-\nJune  30,  1981  (published  October  1981  by  the  Public  Information  Office  Bureau  of\nCorrection),  passim.  A review  of  the  figures  in the  Report  indicating  a decrease  in  the\nnumber of  complaints processed  through  the complaint  system  may reveal  that  there  is  a\ndirect  correlation  between  the  decrease  in such  complaints  and  the  Increase  of  inmates'\ncivil rights filings in the federal district courts in Pennsylvania.\n\nor  not. the  complaints  were  valid.  Neither  approach  offers  promise  of  significantly\ndecreasing the inmates' dissatisfaction  with the handling of  their complaints of  violations\nof the Consent Decree, or their other complaints, because the inmates' complaints would be\nneither  promptly  nor  efficiently  addressed,  thus  denying  them  redress  in  the  case  of\ncomplaints  which are  valid,  which is aiso unfair  to the prison officials  who must  contend\nwith dissatisfied,  disgruntled  inmates  who see  the  Consent  Decree  as having little  value\nbecause of difficulties  in its  enforcement.\nAs I have previously mentioned, however, during the inquiry which I have made\nthe Bureau has conducted an investigation of complaints and demonstrated that it is able to\nadequately  investigate  complaints  and  provide  administrative  remedies  in  appropriate\ncases.  Under  the  terms  of  the  proposed  settlement,  a  new  complaint  system  will  be\nestablished, which draws upon the experience which the Bureau has had in handling  inmate\ncomplaints, and which addresses  the deficiencies  in the present  complaint  system  which\nhave been  identified  during  the  settlement  negotiation  process.  The  component  of  the\nproposed  settlement  which  is  concerned  with  the  resolution  of  inmate  complaints  or\ngrievances  is the  Consolidated Inmate Grievance Review System (Consolidated System,  a\ncopy of  which  is attached),  which has as  its  stated  purpose  that  of  assuring  that  every\ninmate in a Bureau of Correction facility  is aware that he has an avenue through which he\nmey  seek  expeditious  resolution  of  any  problem  which  arises  during  the  course  of  his\nconfinement.  The directive  establishing  the Consolidated  System  will apply  to all  state\ncorrectional institutions (and state regional correctional facilities  and community  service\ncenters).  Under  the  Consolidated  System  all inmates  will have the opportunity  to  have\ntheir  grievances  addressed  at  three (3) levels, an Initial  Review,  which  will include  fact\n•finding and may include preliminary review of the fact finder's decision, Appeal from Initial\nReview,  at  the  level  of  Superintendent  or  Regional  Director,  and  Final  Appeal  to  the\n\nCentral Office.  The directive establishing the Consolidated System provides procedures .for\nreviewing  inmate  grievances  not  alreedy  covered  by  other  Bureau  of  Correction\nAdministrative  Directives  and policies,  and  serves  to integrate  its procedures  with  those\nestablished by other directives.  It revises the Inmate  Complaint System, however,  it  does\nnot supersede or repeal any part of any other directive or policy statement.\nThe  Consolidated  System  provides  that  grievances  and  appeals  must  be  in\nwriting in the format  of forms provided by the correctional  institution  and that  they  shall\nbe  presented  individually.  In preparing  a grievance  or appeal,  the aggrieved  inmate  may\nseek the assistance of a staff  member or fellow  inmate of the same population status.  The\ninmate  may state  any  claims he wishes to make regarding violations of Bureau  directives,\nregulations,  the  Consent  Decree,  or  other  law.  Claims  of  the  violation  of  the  Consent\nDecree  must  be  raised  pursuant  to  the procedure  established  by the  Consolidated  System\nbefore they may be addressed by any court.  Moreover, notice  shall be given to the  Office\nof  Chief  Counsel  of  any  grievance  or  appeal  which  alleges  violations  of  the  Consent\nDecree,  and  Chief  Counsel shall  in  turn  notify  counsel  for  the  plaintiff-class.  With  the\nexception  of grievances  raising issues already governed by other specified  procedures,  the\nInitial  Review  of  an  inmate  grievance  will  consist  of  an  investigation  by  an  Inmate\nGrievance Coordinator, including an interview  with the  inmate  and others having  personal\nknowledge of the subject  matter.  Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of a grievance\nor  appeal,  the  Inmate  Grievance  Coordinator  must  prepare  a  written  response  to  the\ngrievance  including  a  brief  rationale  of  his  conclusions  and  any  action  taken  or\nrecommended.  The Initial Review decision is final unless an appeal is received.\nAn  inmate  may  appeal  an  unsatisfactory  decision  to  the  Superintendent,  in\nwriting,  within  five  (5)  days.  The  Superintendent  must  notify  the  inmate  and  other\ninterested  persons  of  his  decision  within  ten  (10) days  after  receiving  the  appeal.  His\n-•n\n\nf\ndecision  may  consist  of  approval,  disapproval,  modification,  reversal,  remand  or\nreassignment  for  further  fact  finding, end must include a brief statement of the reesons  for\nthe  decision.  Chief  Counsel  will  be  given  notice  of  the  disposition  of  any  appeal  of  a\nmatter  in  which  a  violation  of  the  Consent  Decree  was alleged,  and Chief  Counsel  must\nnotify  counsel for  the plaintiff-class  of thajt  disposition.\nAn inmate  or other  affected  person  may obtain  Final Review  by appealing  the\ndisposition  of  an  appeal  from  the  Initial  Review  decision  to  the  Central  Office  Review\nCommittee (CORC) within seven (7) days of receiving the decision.  The CORC will consist\nof  the  Commissioner,  Deputy  Commissioner  and  Chief  Counsel  or  their  designees.  Final\nReview  is  not  permitted  until  Initial  Review  and  Appeal  from  Initial  Review  procedures\nhave been complied with, except for good cause shown.  The CORC  will issue its  decision\nwithin twenty-one (21) days after  receipt of an appropriate appeal.  If there is no consensus,\nthe  decision  of  the  Commissioner  of  Correction  will control.  Chief  Counsel  will  notify\ncounsel for the plaintiff-class  of the disposition of the Final Review of any matter in which\na violation of the Consent Decree was alleged.\nThe directive establishing the Consolidated System provides that all proceedings\npursuant  to the directive are  in the nature of  settlement  negotiations  and will,  therefore,\nbe inadmissible before  any court or other  tribunal in support of any claim made against  the\nCommonwealth  of Pennsylvania or any employee.  It  further  provides that no resolution  of\na grievance  offered  as  a result  of  the  Consolidated  System  procedure  shall be  admissible\nbefore any court or other tribunal as an edmission of violation of the Consent Decree\nor any state or federal law.\nAs  the  defendants  state  in  their,  brief  in  support  of  their  Motion,  the\nConsolidated System  \"permits an inmate to seek redress of a policy  or practice  as soon  as\nhe  is  affected  by  it  without  having  to  wait  to  gather  enough  evidence  to  show  that  it\n\ncrosses, the threshold of being at minimum an institution-wide occurrence.\"  (pp. 13-14).  The\nConsolidated  System  will  also  correct  specific  flaws  in  the  present  system  of  which  the\ninmates have complained.  They  have  complained  that  the  present  system  denies  prompt\nand adequate  attention  to their  grievances.  They  have  also  complained  that  the  present\nsystem  fails  consistently  in  correcting  problem  situations  brought  to  its  attention.  In\naddition,  they  have  complained  that  under  the  complaint  system  the  initial  inmate\ngrievance  is seldom  the  grievance  to  which  the  complaint  system  responds.  They  have\ncomplained that few inmates, if any, are made aware of the procedures which must be used\nin the filing of a proper inmate  complaint.\nBy remedying  the  complained  of  deficiencies  in the present  complaint  system,\nthe Consolidated System  will encourage and facilitate  the administrative  resolution by  the\nindividual  correctional  institutions  and  by  the  Bureau  of  many  of  the  inmate  complaints\nwhich now give rise to civil rights and other civil actions brought by inmates.  By providing\nan administrative  grievance  review  process  which  is perceived  as  fair  and  effective,  the\nConsolidated System  will divert from  the court system  those inmate complaints which  can\nand should be handled  administratively,  and will thus maximize the ability of the court  to\naddress those complaints which truly require resolution through the judicial process.\nWhile the Consolidated System  will address-all  manner of  inmate complaints,  it\nshould  be noted  that  it  will  serve  to  distinguish  those  complaints  containing  allegations\nwhich meet all of the criteria for complaints which may be brought pursuant to the Consent\nDecree  from  those which do not,  and, with  regard  to proper  Consent  Decree  complaints,\nrequires exhaustion of its procedures as a prerequisite  to the bringing of a court action.  It\nwould seem, therefore,  as an added value  of  this system  that  those  complaints  which  are\nultimately presented  to the court will consist of clearly articulated  claims raising  specific\nissues properly  belonging  before  the  court  as  alleged  violations  of  the  Consent  Decree,\nwhich, of course, is a decided improvement over matters as they now stand.\n\nThe  terms  of  the  proposed  settlement  also provide  for  major  revisions  in  the\nocedures  which  are  followed  by  the  correctional  institutions  in  placing  an  inmate  in\nsciplinary  custody or administrative  custody.  The problems with the disciplinary  hearing\nid administrative  hearing  process have  been  described  by  inmates  testifying  before  me\nid  at  my interviews  with  inmates  during  visits  to  the  institutions;  those  problems  have\neen  attested  to  in  the  complaint  letters  received  from  inmates,  and  specifically\nnumerated  in  the  plaintiffs'  motion  for  contempt.  And,  this  court  should  have  no\n.iflieu!ty  in  taking  notice  of  the  civil rights  actions  filed  by  inmates  which  raise  many\nssues  regarding  disciplinary  and  administrative  custody  proceedings.  The  United  States\nsupreme  Court  has recognized  as laudatory  the  promulgation  of  the  regulations  providing\nfor the procedures which are presently followed in segregated custody hearings.  In a recent\ncase determining whether  compliance with Pennsylvania's regulations governing  segregated\ncustody  hearings  was  constitutionally  required,  the  court  noted  that,  \"the  creation  of\nprocedural guidelines  to channel'the  decision-making  of prison officials  is, in the  view  of\nmany experts in the field,  a salutary development.\"  Hewitt v. Helms, No. 81-638, slip op. at\n10 (February 22,1983).  The proposed settlement makes several improvements in the already\ncomprehensive  procedural  framework  for  disciplinary  and administrative  custody hearings';\nnotable  and praiseworthy  among  those improvements  is the  establishment  of  positions  for\ntrained  hearing  examiners  to  replace  the  present  Hearing  Committees,  as  more  fully\ndescribed below.\nThe  proposed  settlement  provides  that  the  disciplinary  proceedings  shall  be\nbefore a Hearing Committee which is composed of three (3) members:  a Major or  Captain\nof  the Guard; a Casework Supervisor; and a School or Vocational Supervisor.  The Hearing\nCommittee panels are to be selected from  a pool of nine (9) Hearing  Committee  members\ndesignated  at  each  affected  correctional  institution,  except  for  Graterford  which  shall\ndesignate  twelve (12) members.  The Hearing  Committee  members will  receive  in-service\n~wm-\n\n;  in  relevant  areas  of  law  by  means  of  a  curriculum  developed  jointly  by  the\nants and counsel  for  the  plaintiff-class.  The  position  of  Chairman  of  the  Hearing\nittee  is abolished  end  in  its  place  there  will  be a Hearing  Committee  Coordinator\nall be a Casework Supervisor  whose duties will include determining the relevance and\n:ility  of  witnesses,  and  the  extent  of  direct  or  cross  examination  of  witnesses;\ng and explaining  the  charges  to  the charged  inmate; announcing  the decision of  the\n;g Committee  and the  rationale  for  it; and all other  functions  previously  performed\nChairman of  the Hearing Committee.  The proposed settlement  terms provide  that\nimber  of  a  Hearing  Committee  panel  may  hold  a  position  in  which  he  directly\n,'ises another panel member.  Decisions are to be based on the concurrence of two (2)\n2 three (3) Committee  members whose votes shall all have equal weight.  The record\n; Committees' voting  will  not  be  disclosed  to  the  inmate,  except  the  vote  countj\nver,  it  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Program  Review  Committee  when  such  review  Is\n:L  The  Hearing  Committee  panel  cannot  include  any  staff  member  who wrote  or\nDved the misconduct charge(s) or conducted the investigation in the case before  it.\nThe Hearing  Committee  will be replaced  by an individual \"hearing  examiner\",\nin a year of the court's order approving the settlement,  who will assume the duties and\nor,s:bilities  of  the  Hearing Committee  and its Coordinator,  and who will be  employed\nsupervised directly by the Central Office  of the Bureau.  The hearing examiners will be\nified  and  hired  pursuant  to  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  civil service  procedures,\nwill receive training  in the relevant  areas of  law by means of a curriculum  developed\ntly by the defendants and counsel for the  plaintiff-class.\nThe present misconduct procedures are modified as follows.  The ranking  officer\nduty,  who  is  designated  to  be  the  shift,  or  watch  commander,  must  review  all\n^conduct reports, which reports are to be delivered to the inmate by someone other  than\ni charging staff  member wherever practicable.  The inmate is to receive Witness Request\n\nnrnate Version Forms along with the misconduct reports.  The Witness Request must be\nned by 9:00 A.M. of  the next  working day  to  the  block  officer  who shall deliver  it  to\n.earing coordinator.  The Inmates Version Form should be brought to the hearing by the\nie.  The inmate shall be permitted to have the staff  member who witnessed the alleged\nDeduct  present  at  the  hearing,  or,  ff  no  staff  was  an  actual  witness,  he  shall  be\nitted  to have  the  charging staff  member  present.  Any  inmate  assisting  the  charged\nte shall have a reasonable opportunity to address the Hearing Committee or examiner.\nThe inmate  will have  the right  to call  three  (3) witnesses in his behalf, and  he\nbe  requested  to  make  a  statement  regarding  the  relevancy  and  importance  of  the\nis ted  witnesses  on the  witness  form.  Relevant  witnesses shall be produced unless  the\ncticnal  institution  can  establish  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Hearing  Committee  or\niner  that  the  witness  is unavailable, or that  a countervailing security concern exists,\ntablish which the  institution  must present  evidence  that  the requested  witness has  a\n-y of recent  erratic,  hostile or disruptive conduct on a number of occasions such  that\n-esence would unduly disrupt the progress of the hearing.  In the event that a requested\n:ss has no such history but exhibits a current state of mind which would lead to erratic,\n.3 or  disruptive  conduct  at  the  hearing,  the  Hearing  Committee  or  examiner  will\nnelly examine him before  the hearing to determine the suitability of presenting him in\nn at  the  hearing,  and  if  the  decision  is  against  presenting  the  witness,  may  either\nnue  the hearing  until  the  witness  can be  safely  produced,  take  a  written  statement\nhim, or hear his testimony out of the presence of the charged inmate.  Witnesses who\nit  erratic,  hostile  or  disruptive  behaviour  may  be  removed  from  the  hearing.  The\nte  shall  be  permitted  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  question  any  witness  who  has\n\"ied egainst  him, except  in the case of testimony  heard in camera.  When  information\nirting the misconduct charges is supplied by an informant  whose identity should remain\ndential,  the  information  provided  by  the  informant,  but  not  his  identity,  shall  be\n\ndisclosed  to  the  charged  inmate  during  the  hearing,  unless  the  institution  has  reason  to\nbelieve that disclosure of the information  would reveal the informant's  identity.  Informant\nreliability  must  be established  to  the Hearing Committee  or examiner by a preponderance\nof  the  evidence,  and  the  inmate  shall  be  present  during  the  presentation  of  reliability\nevidence,  unless  the institution  concludes ^that disclosure would jeopardize the  institution's\nsecurity,  in  which  event,  the  evidence  shall  be  presented  m camera.  No witnesses  axe\nrequired  where  the  inmate  pleads  guilty  or  waives his right  to  a  hearing.  All  testimony\nmust  be  under  oath.  Determinations  of  credibility  ere  at  the  discretion  of  the  Hearing\nCommittee or examiner, who shall make written findings of fact  referring  to the  testimony\nof each witness.\nIf  the inmate  is acquitted,  all records of the misconduct shall be expunged  from\nhis  institutional  record.  If  he  is  convicted  he  may  appeal  to  the  Program  Review\nCommittee  on any  of  three  (3) bases:  insufficiency  of  the  facts  to  support  the  verdict;\ndisproportionality  between  the  punishment  and  the  offense;  nonconformity  of  the\nprocedures  employed  with  the  directive  or  the  Consent  Decree.  The  Program  Review\nCommittee  may uphold,  remand  or  uphold  with  modification  the  decision  of  the  Hearing\nCommittee  or  examiner,  but  may  not  increase  the  punishment  imposed.  The  Program\nReview Committee's decision must be rendered within five (5) working days of receipt  of  an\nappeeL\nThe inmate may appeal  the  decision of the Program  Review  Committee  to  the\nSuperintendent upon any of the same three (3) bases, and the Superintendent  may make  any\ndisposition  permitted  to the Program  Review Committee.  His decision must be  forwarded\nto the inmate within three (3) working days of his receipt of the appeaL  A final  appeal,  on\ni\nthe bases of  insufficiency  of the  evidence  to support  the verdict  or nonconformity  of  the\nprocedures  employed  with  the  directive  or  the  Consent  Decree,  may  be  made  to  the\n11\n\nattorney assigned as counsel to the Bureau in the Central  Office.\nThe  proposed  settlement  elso  revises  the  procedures  to  be  followed  where  an\ninmate is to be placed in administrative custody.  It provides, first,  that an inmate who has\ncompleted  his  disciplinary  sentence  shall  be  released  and  cannot  then  be  continued  in\nadministrative  custody  unless  the  institution  presents  evidence  to  the  Program  Review\nt\nCommittee  that  there  is  a  valid  security  reason  for  continuing  him  in  administrative\ncustody.  When an inmate  is  transferred  to  administrative  custody  from  the  general\npopulation, and the  basis  fcr  his transfer  is not an outstanding  misconduct  charge, a  self-\ncommital  or  confinement  under  investigative  status,  he  shall  be  provided  with  a  hearing\nbefore the Program Review  Committee, at  which he has the right  to be present, within six\n(6) days of his transfer.  At  that  hearing the institution must present  evidence to establish\nthat  there  is a valid security  reason to  confine  the  inmate  in administrative  custody.  A\nvalid  security  reason  exists  when  an  inmate  is a  danger  to  others  in  the  institution  who\ncannot  be  protected  by  alternate  measures,  a  danger  to  himself,  the  instigator  of  a\ndisturbance, or likely to attempt  escape.  Commitment to administrative custody may only\nbe for a specified period, after  which the inmate is entitled  to an additional hearing  before\nhe  may  be  confined  beyond  the  original  period.  In  addition,  the  Program  Review\nCommittee  must  submit  to  the  Superintendent  a status  report-detailing  the  reasons  why\ncontinued administrative  custody is necessary.  If the Superintendent determines that  those\nreasons are valid,  the Program  Review  Committee  will so  notify  the  inmate.  If  he  does\nnot,  he shall cause  the Program  Review  Committee  to schedule a  continuation hearing  at\nwhich the segregated  inmate and the institution  may present evidence.  The inmate  or  the\nSuperintendent  may  appeal  to  the  Deputy  Commissioner  the  decision  of  the  Program\nReview  Committee  with regard  to the placement  or denial of  placement  of  an  inmate  in\nadministrative  custody, and  the  Deputy  Commissioner  must  rule on the  appeal within  two\n12\n\n(2) working days of receipt of the appeal.\nThe  complaints  of  inmates  regarding  the  conduct  of  disciplinary  and\nadministrative procedures are substantially  addressed  by the revisions in those  procedures\nprovided  for  by the  proposed settlement.  Those complaints h&ve included allegations  thet\ninmates have not been allowed  to question  witnesses presented  in support  of  the  charges\nagainst  them,  and  that  the  charged  inmates  arid  their  inmate  assistants  are  sequestered\nduring  the  testimony  of  witnesses  supporting  the  misconduct  charges,  and  are  not  given\nsummaries  of  the  testimony  of  those  witnesses.  They have also complained  that  they  are\nnot provided with a detailed summary of the Hearing Committee's decision or the  rationale\nfor  the  decision.  They have complained  that the Hearing Committee often  refuses  to  call\nnecessary  witnesses  and  that  the  charging  staff  member  is seldom  present  to  read  the\ncharges against  the  inmate(s).  They have complained  that  although inmate  assistants  are\nallowed  to confer  with the charged  inmate  during  the hearing,  the  assistant  is  precluded\nfrom  directly addressing the hearing panel which, in rendering its decision, rarely considers\nthe inability of the charged inmate to adequately represent himself before  the paneL  The\nrevisions  in  those  procedures  are  also  responsive  to  the  inmates  complaints  that  the\ndefendants  have  transferred  inmates  from  disciplinary  custody  to  equivalent  isolation  in\nadministrative custody for an indefinite  period.\nThe  proposed  settlement  also  provides  for  changes  in  medical  care  for  the\nInmates.  The  civil  service  class  for  corrections  infirmary  supervisors  is closed,  and  any\ncivil  service  positions which become  vacant  are being filled  by registered  nurses.  Within\none (1) year, every corrections infirmary supervisor is to be trained and licensed as either  a\nregistered  nurse  or  emergency  medical  technician;  within  two  (2)  years  there  will  be\npositions established in each institution to have registered nurses on duty twenty-four  (24)\nhours  a  day.  These  changes  are  responsive  to  the  inmates1 complaints  that  immediate\n13\n\nmedical  attention  is  not  available  in  emergency  situations,  and  is  not  available  to  all\ninmfites with injuries or illness who require such emergency  attention.\nBy the  terms  of  the proposed  settlement,  changes also will be made in the  law\nlibraries.  Inmates  in the Restricted Housing Units of  their  institutions will have access  to\nspecified  statutes  and they  may request  copies of cases which shall be provided at no cost,\nwhich they may keep for up to one (1) month subject  to'!demand, and limits in the number  of\ncopies.\nIn addition,  the proposed settlement establishes guidelines for the conducting of\ncell  searches.  In  random  cell  searches,  the  selection  of  the  cell  will  take  place  at  a\nlocation  removed  from  the  block  where  the  search  is  to  be  performed,  and  shall  be\nrandomly  made and performed  by a staff  member  unassociated  with  the administration  of\nany block or blocks where a search is to be conducted.  These searches may not take place\nlater than one (1) hour after  the institution has been locked in for the evening.\nThe  occupant  of  the  cell  selected  shall  be  notified  before  the  search  by  the\nblock officer,  and he must be given the option of remaining during the search.  He will  be\nasked  to sign a record  to show  that  he was present  during  the  search,  or to show that  he\ndesired to be absent.  Material taken during the search will be noted on a property  receipt,-\na  copy  of  which  will  be  supplied  to  the  inmate.  Confiscated  items  must  be  kept  In  a\nseparately secured area until a determination of their disposition has been made.\nInvestigative  cell  searches  must  be  approved  by  the  ranking  officer  on  duty\nurJess there are exigent  circumstances.  If  a search  is to be  made  without permitting  the\ninmate  to  be present,  it  must  be  determined  that  his presence  would pose an  immediate\nthreat  to security,  that  emergency  conditions exist,  or that  his presence  would  impair  an\nongoing  investigation  of  criminal  activity  or  of  the  violation  of  institutional  regulations.\nThe implementation  of the new procedures  which  the  proposed  settlement  would  establish\nfor  the conducting of cell searches will eliminate the basis for  the inmates' complaints  that\n14\n\ntheir cells are searched routinely without their presence despite the lack of conditions  -\njustifying such in absentia searches.\nThe proposed settlement  contains provisions governing the administrative  action\nto  be  taken  when  contraband  is discovered.  It  provides  that  the  Class  I  Misconduct  of\n«\npossession of contraband will be modified in its definition of contraband, and it provides  the\nnew definition  of contraband.  It also provides that  the possession  of  items not  authorized\nfor  retention  or receipt  by inmates, but not one of the items specified  in the definition  of\ncontraband,  will be dealt with as a Class 2 Misconduct,  for  which the only sanction will be\nconfiseetion.\nThe  proposed  settlement  further  provides  that  it  shall  not  operate  as  an\nadmission on the part  of thedefendants  regarding the truth of any of the allegations  made\nin the plaintiffs'  motion for contempt, and that the plaintiffs  agree that any failure by the\ndefendants to comply with it prior to its approval shall not in and of itself  create a cause of\naction for any party.  Nor will the proposed settlement create a private cause of action  for\nany individual against any defendant.\nHowever,  the plaintiffs  reserve the right  to contest  in this court at any time by\nany appropriate legal proceeding any institution-wide  or system-wide  pattern  of  failure  or\nrefusal  by  the  defendants  or  their  agents  to  follow  the  provisions  of  the  proposed\nsettlement.  The  settlement  is not  to  form  the  basis  for  contempt  proceedings  for  any\nfailure  or  refusal  which  is  less  than  an  institution-wide  or  system-wide  pattern-  The\nsettlement  provides  that  the defendants  may only be liable to any individual for  damages\nfor  failure  to comply with it if the alleged failure constitutes a violation of state or  federal\nlaw or if the court imposes such damages as part of a contempt proceeding pursuant  to  the\nsettlement.\nNotice  to  the  plaintiff-class  of  the  proposed  settlement  was  accomplished  by\nmeans of a  method  proposed by counsel  for  the defendants,  agreed  to  by counsel  for  the\n15\n\nplaintiff-class,  and which I approved.  Notices were posted on inmate bulletin boards at  all\naffected  institutions  from  November 22 to December  3, 1982, explaining  the status  of  the\ncase,  and  informing  the  inmates  that  copies  of  documents  detailing  the  terms  of  the\nsettlement proposals had been placed in the institution library  for  their review.  The  notice\ninstructed  that  if  the  inmates  desired  to  object  to  the proposed settlement  or any  of  its\nterms, they had to file a written statement  detailing  the grounds for  their  objections  with\nthe Clerk of Court by December 3, 1982, and send copies to counsel for the defendants  and\nfor  the plaintiff-class.  The notice further  said that  any person who did not  file  objections\nwould be deemed to have waived all objections.  Letters of objection v;ere submitted,  which\nI have reviewed.\nIn evaluating  the  terms of this proposed settlement, I have recognized  that  the\nlaw  favors  settlement  agreements  and  that  because  such  agreements  are  a  means-of\namicably  resolving  disputes  they  should  be  upheld  whenever  possible.  Miller v.  Republic\nNational  Life  Insurance  Company,  559  F.2d  426,  428  (5th  Cir.  1977),  citing  Pearson  v.\nEcological  Science  Corp.,  522  F.2d  171 (5th  Cir.  1975).  In  a  class  action  the  proposed\nsettlement  must satisfy  the two-fold requirement  that  it be fair,  adequate and reasonable,\nand that  it be arrived at  with no fraud  or collusion.  Id.  While supervising the negotiation\"\nwhich led  to this proposed  settlement,  I have been  mindful  of  the  prohibition  egainst  the\ncourt  attempting  to  modify  the  terms  of  the  proposed  settlement  agreement  or\nparticipating  in any bargaining for better terms.  Plummer v. Chemical Bank, 668 F.2d 654.\n655  n.l  (2d  Cir.  1982)  citing  In  Re  General  Motors  Corporation  Engine  Interchange\nLitigation, 594 F.2d 1106, 1125 n.24 (7th Cir.) cert, denied, 444 U.S. 870, 100 S.Ct 146 (1979).\nI  have  given  comprehensive  consideration  to  all  of  the  factors  which  are\ngenerally  relevant  to  the  determination  of  whether  a  class  action  settlement  should  be\napproved, including, inter alia, the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation;\n16\n\nthe  reaction  of  the class  to the settlement;  the stage  of the proceedings; and the risks of\nestablishing  liability,  City  of  Detroit  v.  Grinnell  Corporation,  495 F.2d  448, 452-463  (2d\nCir.  1974).  Moreover,  I conclude  that  the  class  members have had  notice  in  accordance\nwith  Fed.R.Civ.Pr.  23(e).  That  notice  has more  than satisfied  the requirement  that  ^the\nnotice  given  must  be 'reasonably  calculated,  under  all  of  the  circumstances,  to  apprise\ninterested parties of the pendency of the ection and afford  them an opportunity to present\ntheir  objections.'  \"  Grunin v. International  House of  Pancakes,  513 F.2d 114, 120 (8th  Cir.\n1975), quoting, Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).  That\nnotice has also reasonably conveyed the required information  end afforded  those  interested\na reasonable time to respond.  Id.\nBearing  in  mind  that  it  is  not  the  function  of  the  court  to  substitute  its\n«\njudgment for that of the parties in reaching agreement on the proposed settlement, I have,\nnevertheless,  felt  compelled, because  of  the mandate of the order referring  the matter  to\nme, to go into some detail in analyzing its provisions, and to determine  the extent to  which\nit  addresses  the inmates1 complaints.  In the evaluation of the proposed settlement, I have\nconsidered  the  complaints  of  the  inmates  as  stated  in  the  Motion  for  Contempt  and\notherwise, their testimony during the hearings before  me, and their comments made during\nmy interviews with them at  the institutions.  I have also considered  the arguments  of  the\ndefendants  in  support  of  their  motion  end  the  plaintiffs'  objections  to  the  proposed\nsettlement,  as well as the defendants'  specific  responses  in their  motion to  the  objections\nfiled by members of the plaintiff-class.  I am convinced that the proposed settlement  is the\nproduct  of  arms-length  negotiations  by  counsel  who  have  aggressively  end  zealously\nrepresented the interests of their clients.  I conclude that it is responsive to the  complaints\nof  the  inmates,  and  that  it  is  fair,  adequate  and  reasonable,  and  I  endorse  it  without\nreservation.  My recommendation is attached hereto.\n17\n\nr\nRECOMMENDATION\nAND NOW, this  9~ -  day of May, 1983, it  is recommended  that  the  defendants'\nMotion  for Approval  of Stipulation  for  Dismissal of  Outstanding  Allegations  of  Contempt\nand  for  Dismissal  of  Motion  for  Contempt  be  granted,  and  that  the  compromise  of  the\nplaintiffs'  action  for  contempt  be  approved  and  the  action  be  dismissed  pursuant  to  the\nterms  included  in the  outstanding Stipulation, filed  December 29, 1981, and modified  by en\nemendment to the Stipulation, filed  July 31, 1982.  It is further  recommended  that  pursuant\nto  the  terms  of  the  compromise  (settlement)  that  when the  administrative  procedure  for\ninmate grievances is adopted,  members of  the plaintiff-class  must  exhaust  that  procedure\nbefore  filing with the court any allegations of violations of  the Consent Decree and/or any\nallegations of contempt.\nWILLIAM F.

No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996)\n(codified in part at 18 U.S.C. § 3626), filed September 23, 1997 (Doc. No. 775), plaintiffs' Motion in Opposition to\nDefendants' Motion to Terminate Preliminary Relief and in the Alternative to Declare the Prison Litigation Reform\nUnconstitutional or to Certify the Transfer of This Action's Consent Decree with Related Orders to the\nCommonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, filed September 24, 1997 (Doc.

No. 778), and plaintiffs'\n[1]\nAmended Motion for Contempt, filed October 28, 1997 (Doc. No. 797).  In addition to the submissions of\nplaintiffs and defendants, the Court has considered the position of the United States government which\nintervened in the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a) and submitted a Memorandum of Law Concerning the\nConstitutionality of the Challenged Provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (Doc. No. 791). Oral argument\nwas heard on November 19, 1997. For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that the termination\nprovisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act at issue are constitutional. Accordingly, the Court will grant\ndefendants' Motion to Terminate All Outstanding Orders for Prospective Relief, deny plaintiffs' Motion to Declare\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act Unconstitutional and deny plaintiffs' motion to Certify the Transfer of the Consent\nDecree and Related Orders to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The Court will also deny plaintiffs'\ncontempt motions.\nI. BACKGROUND\n1. History of the Case\nBetween 1970 and 1971 four related cases challenging the constitutionality of conditions and policies at the\n[2]\nseven Pennsylvania State Correctional Institutions (\"SCIs\") then in operation  were filed in this Court. On May\n22, 1978, after those suits had been consolidated and a plaintiff class certified, then-Chief Judge Joseph S. Lord,\nIII approved a Consent Decree which settled the majority of issues raised by the plaintiff class. At that time, the\nCourt expressly retained jurisdiction over the Decree. Since then, numerous issues have been addressed in\nsubsequent opinions of the Court and various stipulations and amendments to the Decree have been approved\n[3]\nby the Court.\n591\n\n*591 In its current form, the Consent Decree and its amendments govern many aspects of the daily operations of\nthe seven SCIs. The Decree required defendants to establish a code of conduct specifying both that behavior\nwhich was punishable 00 a misconduct 00 and the type of punishment which could be imposed. The Decree also\n97 97\ngives inmates certain rights when charged with a misconduct, including written notice, a hearing, the right to\nprepare and be assisted in presenting a defense, and the right to written findings. Among its detailed procedures,\nthe Decree governs such things as: the handling of inmate mail; the right of inmates to obtain and keep outside\npublications; minimum inmate health care requirements; the use of force, restraints and mace by prison officials;\nthe information which must be provided to new inmates; the procedures for conducting cell searches; the right of\ninmates to visitors; the minimum inmate housing conditions; and the right of inmates to wear civilian clothing.\nIn 1980, the plaintiffs filed a contempt motion in which they alleged that defendants' were not complying with a\nnumber of the provisions of the Consent Decree. On December 30, 1980, with the assistance of United States\nMagistrate Judge William F. Hall, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the motion for contempt and with the\nfurther assistance of Magistrate Judge Hall, the 1980 Stipulation was amended by an agreement of the parties\nand eventually approved by Judge Lord on May 11, 1983 [hereinafter the \"1983 Amendment to Stipulation\"].\nSome of the procedures established by the Consent Decree were modified by the 1983 Amendment to\nStipulation, principally the grievance and misconduct procedures. The 1983 Amendment to Stipulation also\naddressed issues involving medical care, inmate law libraries, cell search procedures and administrative\ndetention.\nThe current round of litigation began when defendants filed a Motion to Terminate, seeking to end their\nobligations under the Consent Decree pursuant to the termination provisions of the PLRA. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626\n(b)(2). Plaintiffs countered with multiple filings: the first seeks to have the PLRA declared unconstitutional or to\nhave the case transferred to the Commonwealth Court; the others seek to have defendants held in civil contempt.\n2. Issues Presented\nThe first, and primary, issue presented is whether the termination provisions of the PLRA are constitutional.\nPlaintiffs have mounted a multi-prong constitutional attack on these provisions, alleging that they violate the\nseparation of powers embodied in Article III, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, the equal protection\ntights inherent in the Fifth Amendment, and, in a passing reference, the Tenth Amendment's reservation of\nunenumerated powers to the states. If the Court finds that the termination provisions survive these challenges, it\nmust decide whether, under the PLRA, defendants have satisfied the requirements for termination. Next, the\nCourt must turn to the question of how plaintiffs' contempt motions interact with the PLRA's termination provisions\nand defendants right to terminate the Decree. Plaintiffs argue that even if the termination provisions are\nconstitutional, defendants' contempt requires this court to stay application of those provisions, either by holding\ndefendants' Motion to Terminate in abeyance or dismissing it until the contempt is purged; plaintiffs premise this\nargument on the Court's inherent contempt power. Alternatively, plaintiffs' seek to bar defendants from\nproceeding under the equitable doctrine of \"unclean hands.\" Defendants respond that there is no authority for\nsuch action and reiterate their position that the Court should end its supervision of the Consent Decree and its\nmodifications by ordering termination of the Decree. Finally, if defendants are entitled to relief, the Court must\ndecide what is appropriate.\na. The PLRA's Termination Provisions\nThe termination provisions of the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2), recite that defendants are \"entitled to immediate\n592 termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a *592 finding by the\ncourt that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\n[4]\nright, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"  Under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3), a court may not terminate relief if it finds that there is a \"current and ongoing violation of the Federal\n[5]\nright\"  and that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary and is the least intrusive means\npossible to correct the violation. (Plaintiffs in this case have expressly declined to attempt to establish that there\nis a \"current and ongoing violation\" of a federal right.) Moreover, the court must \"promptly rule on any motion to\n\n[6]\nmodify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions.\" Id. at § 3626(e)(1).\nProspective relief is defined as \"all relief other than compensatory monetary damages,\" id. § at 3626(g)(7) and\nrelief expressly includes \"consent decrees.\" Id. at § 3626(g)(9).\nb. Background of the Contempt Motions\nOf particular importance to the current contempt motions is the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation. Plaintiffs'\ncontempt motions involve the issue of whether provisions in the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation bind defendants\nto specific time lines for the resolution of prisoner grievances and misconducts. The 1983 Amendment to\nStipulation states that \"[d]efendants shall within 60 days of the approval of this Amendment submit to counsel for\nthe plaintiff-class, a proposal for an administrative grievance procedure for the processing of allegations by any\nmember of the plaintiff-class....\" 1993 Amendment to Stipulation ¶ I.B.1. In addition, the 1983 Amendment to\nStipulation clearly details procedures for misconduct proceedings, including the requirement that the \"Program\nReview Committee shall render its decision within five (5) working days of receipt of an appeal\" and that the\nSuperintendent must forward his decision to the inmate within three working days of his receipt of an appeal of\nthe Program Review Committee's decision.\nIn a Report and Recommendation dated May 5, 1983, Magistrate Judge Hall made detailed findings with respect\nto, and recommended approval of, the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation. Included in those findings was a lengthy\ndiscussion of the Consolidated Inmate Grievance Review System submitted by defendants pursuant to the 1983\nAmendment to Stipulation and the time line for this review; the time line required the Inmate Grievance\nCoordinator to respond within ten days to a grievance; thereafter an inmate was permitted five days to appeal a\ndecision to the Superintendent who then had to reach his or her own decision within ten days of the appeal. The\nSuperintendent's decision was further appealable within seven days to the three-person Central Office Review\nCommittee (\"CORC\") which had twenty-one days to reach a decision. This system, and these time lines, were\ncodified in DC-ADM 804 and remained in force until November 1, 1997. See Stipulation of Uncontested Facts ¶\n25. Magistrate Judge Hall's Report and Recommendation was approved and adopted by Judge Lord by Order\n[7]\ndated May 11, 1983.\n593 *593 Plaintiffs contend in their contempt motions that the time lines are binding on defendants, that defendants\nhave failed to abide by the time lines, and that that failure constitutes contempt on the part of defendants. In\nresponse, defendants argue that they are not bound by the grievance procedures set forth in the Report and\nRecommendation but only by those procedures contained in the body of the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation itself\nwhich does not include the details of the Grievance Review System. They have also stipulated that \"[f]rom\nJanuary 1, 1996, through the middle of 1997, the defendants and their agents have failed in a significant number\nof instances to respond to inmate grievances and appeals therefrom within the time frames described in\nMagistrate [Judge] Hall's Report and Recommendation.\" Stipulation of Uncontested Facts, ¶ 24.\nAs of November 1, 1997, defendants amended DC-ADM 804 to require only one member of CORC to participate\nin any given appeal. They argue that this step will streamline the grievance procedure and thus will benefit the\n[8]\nplaintiff-class by increasing the prison authority's response time to grievances.  Plaintiffs contend that\ndefendants may not change these procedures because they are bound by the time lines detailed in Magistrate\nJudge Hall's Report and Recommendation.\nDefendants also acknowledge that \"[f]rom January 1, 1996, through the middle of 1997, there have been\ninstances where defendants and their agents have failed to respond to inmate misconduct appeals within the\ntime delineated in Magistrate Judge Hall's Report and Recommendation.\" Stipulation of Uncontested Facts ¶ 31.\nDefendants add that the procedures outlined by Magistrate Judge Hall exceed those recommended by the\nAmerican Correctional Association (\"ACA\"), id. at ¶¶ 27-30, and that they intend to amend the procedures and\nbring them into conformity with the ACA standards if the Consent Decree is terminated. Id. at ¶ 32. Defendants\nfurther insist that the instances of non-compliance with the misconduct time lines do not amount to a system or\ninstitution-wide violation and thus, under the terms of the consent decree, plaintiffs may not seek contempt\n[9]\nsanctions.\n\nIn addition to the alleged failure of defendants to abide by the time frames set forth in the 1983 Amendment to\nStipulation and Magistrate Judge Hall's Report and Recommendation, plaintiffs seek to prevent defendants from\nchanging the regulation governing what type of clothing inmates may wear. The regulation in force until\nNovember 26, 1997 allowed inmates to wear various types of civilian clothing, including T-shirts and sweatshirts\nwith commercial logos. See DC-ADM 815; Stipulation of Uncontested Facts ¶ 6. The new regulation will\neffectively limit inmates to a narrow range of approved clothing that is either white or cocoa brown and which\ndoes not display any logo, trademark or brand name. See Stipulation of Uncontested Facts ¶ 16. The\nconsequence is that prisoners were required to dispose of those clothes in their possession which did not satisfy\n594 the new regulation before that regulation *594 went into effect on November 26, 1997. Possession of non-\nconforming clothes became punishable on December 26, 1997. Id. at ¶ 18.\nPlaintiffs seek to have defendants held in contempt on the ground that the new clothing regulation violates the\noriginal Consent Decree. With respect to that issue, the Consent Decree provides that \"[d]efendants shall permit\nresidents to wear civilian clothing when the residents are housed in general population except to the extent that\nthe superintendent of each institution requires institutional issue to be worn for work. However, defendants\nreserve the right to require residents to wear specific articles of clothing issued solely for the purpose of visitation\nduring a resident's presence in the visiting areas of the institution. Furthermore, defendants reserve the right to\nimpose reasonable regulations with respect to civilian clothing on the basis of safety, sanitary and security\nconsiderations.\" Consent Decree ¶ XVII.\nAfter the escape of six prisoners on January 8, 1997, Commissioner of Corrections Martin Horn released a\nReport detailing the causes of, and concerns relating to, that escape. See Id. at ¶¶ 9-14. The report detailed\n\"Primary Causes of Escape\" and \"security lapses that allowed escape.\" The parties have stipulated that \"[t]he\nissue of inmate access to civilian clothing is listed only thereafter in the report as a concern related to the\nescape.\" Id. at ¶ 14. Defendants cite this security concern as a principal reason for the change in clothing policy.\n[10]\nPlaintiffs also seek to have defendants held in contempt based on defendants' alleged failure to provide inmates\naccess to health care through sick calls on weekends. The Consent Decree provides that at \"all Bureau of\nCorrections facilities which provide inpatient treatment for inmates, the Bureau shall provide twenty-four (24) hour\nmedical care to such inmates.... [And][t]here will be daily sick call at all institutions by a properly trained health\nprofessional.\" Appendix A to Consent Decree, ¶¶ 4-5.\nInitially, because counsel for the plaintiff class lacked evidence to support the weekend sick call claim, it was\nvoluntarily withdrawn. After the hearing on the pending motions, however, members of the plaintiff class filed\nPlaintiffs' Objections to Portions of the \"Stipulation of Uncontested Facts,\" filed December 16, 1997 (Doc.No.828).\nIn this filing, three members, John M. Payne, Stanley J. Hertzog and James (Sonny) Watson, stated in affidavits\nthat in the past, it had been the defendants' practice to provide sick calls on a daily basis. Given this new\ninformation, counsel for plaintiffs' class seeks both to reinstate the contempt claim based on inadequate health\n[11]\ncare and to have the affidavits introduced into evidence. The Court granted the requested relief.\n3. Conclusion 00 Summary\n97\nThe Court has carefully considered both the oral arguments and written submissions of the parties and concludes\nthat the termination provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act are constitutional. As such, because the\n595 requirements of those provisions *595 are met, the Court will terminate the relief provided by the Consent Decree\nand its amendments. The Court also concludes that it should take this action regardless of whether defendants\nare currently violating provisions of the Consent Decree. Therefore, to the extent plaintiffs seek coercive\nsanctions 00 that is, sanctions which force defendants to comply with the terms of the Consent Decree 00 the Court\n97 97\nneed not, and will not, reach the issue of whether defendants are in contempt. To the extent, however, that\nplaintiffs seek compensatory sanctions 00 that is, sanctions ordering defendants to compensate plaintiffs for the\n97\nloss of their civilian clothing 00 the Court finds that defendants have not violated the provisions of the Consent\n97\nDecree governing inmate clothing.\n\nII. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS OF THE\nPRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT\nPlaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of the termination provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act on\nmany grounds. They principally argue that the PLRA: violates separation of powers; denies due process; and\n[12]\nabridges the right of inmates to equal protection of the law.  The Court examines each of these grounds below.\nFirst, however, it must address a preliminary issue.\nPlaintiffs argue that the Court must examine the statute as a whole in determining whether it is constitutional. It\nwould be improper, they contend, to examine the termination provisions outside the context of the other\nprovisions 00 such as the limits on federally enforceable settlements, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3626(a)(1)(A), 3626(c), on the\n97\nduration of relief, id. at 3626(b), on preliminary injunctions, id. at 3626(a)(2), and on the right of prisoners to\nproceed in forms pauperis, 28 U.S.C. § 1915, to name just a few. This impropriety exists, they argue, because,\nwhile any one provision might withstand constitutional scrutiny, when taken together, the PLRA's provisions\nunfairly burden prison inmates and are thus unconstitutional. Plaintiffs cite Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 116\nS.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1994) for the proposition that courts, when determining whether a statute measures\nup to constitutional norms, should look at the entire statute.\nThe Court rejects the approach advanced by plaintiffs. It will not examine the constitutionality of the PLRA in its\nentirety. Romer involved a facial challenge to an entire statute and the Supreme Court therefore examined the\nstatute as a whole. See id. at 1623; see also Dougan v. Singletary, 129 F.3d 1424, 1427 n. 15 (11th Cir.1997). In\nthis case, only the termination provisions of the PLRA are at issue, and the Court will address only those\nprovisions.\nThe Court turns, therefore, to plaintiffs' first argument: that the termination provisions violate Article III's\nseparation of powers both by reopening a final judgment and prescribing a rule of decision.\nA. Separation of Powers\n\"In republican government the legislative authority, necessarily, predominates.\" The Federalist No. 51, 350\n(James Madison) (J.E. Cooke ed., 1961). This truism has meant that the \"Court has declined to adopt formalistic\nand unbending rules.... [in order not to] unduly constrict Congress' ability to take needed and innovative action\npursuant to its Article I powers.\" Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 851, 106 S.Ct.\n3245, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986) (holding that act giving Commodities Futures Trading Commission power to\n596 entertain state law counterclaims does not violate Article *596 III) (citations omitted). At the same time, however,\na court must examine legislation \"with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the\nconstitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary ... [and must consider] the extent to which the `essential\nattributes of judicial power' are reserved to Article III courts.... the origins and importance of the right to be\nadjudicated, and the concerns that drove Congress to depart from the requirements of Article III.\" Id. (citations\nomitted).\nPlaintiffs argue first that the PLRA is unconstitutional because the termination provisions violate separation of\npowers. After careful examination, however, the Court must conclude 00 like six circuits before it 00 that the PLRA\n97 97\nneither reopens a final judgment nor prescribes a rule of decision in violation of the Constitution.\n1. Reopening Final Judgments\nPlaintiffs contend that by providing for the termination of consent decrees, Congress has violated separation of\npowers 00 unconstitutionally encroaching on the judiciary 00 by reopening a final judgment. The proposition that\n97 97\nCongress may not constitutionally reopen final judgments was recently articulated by the Supreme Court in Plaut\nv. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995). That case involved an earlier\ndecision, Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 115 L.Ed.2d 321\n\n(1991), in which the Supreme Court adopted a national limitations period applicable to civil actions under § 10(b)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Unhappy with the result of this uniform statute of limitations, Congress\nenacted a statute which required courts to reinstate § 10(b) actions which had been pending before Lampf, but\nwere then dismissed as a result of the Lampf limitations period. Plaut's case was dismissed as untimely in\naccordance with Lampf and no appeal was taken; only after Congress enacted the new statute did Plaut seek\nreinstatement of his case.\nIn Plaut, the Court concluded that Congress \"exceeded its authority by requiring the federal courts to exercise\n`the judicial Power of the United States,' U.S. Const. Art. III, § 1, in a manner repugnant to the text, structure and\ntraditions of Article III.\" Plaut at 218, 115 S.Ct. 1447. Congress did so by \"retroactively commanding the federal\ncourts to reopen final judgments,\" id. at 219, 115 S.Ct. 1447, because once a judgment has \"achieved finality.... a\njudicial decision becomes the last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy,\nand congress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable to that very case was something\nother than what the court said it was.\" Id. at 227, 115 S.Ct. 1447.\nThat Congress may not reopen a final judgment is a premise of law which cannot be questioned. The issue\npresented, though, is whether a consent decree is a \"final judgment\" for separation of powers purposes. Plaintiffs\nrely on Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), for the\nproposition that a consent decree \"is an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be\nenforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.\"\nId. at 378, 112 S.Ct. 748. As such, the Rufo Court said that \"a consent decree is a final judgment that may be\nreopened only to the extent that equity requires.\" Id. at 391, 112 S.Ct. 748.\nIt should be noted, however, that these broad statements of law in Rufo were made in the context of a discussion\nof the circumstances that permit a court to modify a consent decree. In general, a \"party seeking modification of a\nconsent decree may meet its initial burden by showing.... a significant change either in factual conditions or law.\" \nRufo, at 384, 112 S.Ct. 748. Indeed, a \"consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later turns out, one or\nmore of [its] obligations has become impermissible under federal law.\" Id. at 388, 112 S.Ct. 748; see also \nAgostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 2006, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997) (\"A court errs when it refuses to\nmodify an injunction or consent decree in light of ... changes\" in decisional or statutory law); Landgraf v. USI Film\n597 Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 273, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994)*597 (\"When the intervening statute\nauthorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the new provision is not retroactive.\"); \nSystem Federation No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 652, 81 S.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961) (a \"court will not\ncontinue to exercise its powers ... [under a decree] when a change in law or facts has made inequitable what was\nonce equitable\"). In contrast to prospective relief which may be modified, an award of monetary damages is truly\nfinal, regardless of changes in the underlying law. As the Court put it in Plaut, a judgment is final for separation of\npowers purposes when it is the \"last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or\ncontroversy.\" Plaut, at 227, 115 S.Ct. 1447. A consent decree simply is not the \"last word\" of a court on a\nparticular case or controversy.\nThe distinction 00 between prospective relief and final awards 00 is best demonstrated in the Supreme Court's\n97 97\nearly decision in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 421, 15 L.Ed. 435 (1855)\n[hereinafter \"Wheeling Bridge\"]. In that case, the Supreme Court held that Congress could change the law such\nthat the Court was required to end an injunction it had ordered in an earlier case.\nWheeling Bridge arose out of an earlier case in which the Supreme Court had held that a bridge was a public\nnuisance because it interfered with navigable waters and ordered the bridge raised or removed. After this\ndecision, the bridge was destroyed in a storm; when rebuilding commenced, Pennsylvania sought enforcement of\nthe prior order in an effort to prevent reconstruction of the bridge. In the interim, however, Congress had passed a\nlaw making the bridge part of a post-road which could not be interfered with by riparian navigation. This, the\nCourt held in Wheeling Bridge, was well within the powers of Congress although it dictated an outcome different\nfrom the one the Court had reached in the earlier case, namely, that the prior injunction could not be enforced\nand the bridge could therefore be rebuilt.\nPlaintiffs argue that Wheeling Bridge makes a distinction between \"public\" rights and \"private\" rights. Congress,\nthey say, has the power to alter prospective relief only where it has plenary power over the underlying law, where,\n\nin other words, the underlying law concerns a \"public\" right. According to plaintiffs, because the consent decree in\nthis case is premised on the constitutional rights of inmates, private rights, Congress may not alter the scope of\nthe Consent Decree. This argument derives from the Supreme Court's statement in Wheeling Bridge that: \"it is\nurged, that the act of congress cannot have the effect and operation to annul the judgment of the court already\nrendered, or the rights determined thereby.... This, as a general proposition, is certainly not to be denied,\nespecially as it respects adjudication upon the private rights of parties. When they have passed into judgment the\nright becomes absolute, and it is the duty of the court to enforce it.\" Wheeling Bridge at 431 (emphasis added).\nThat is far from a holding that the rationale of Wheeling Bridge is limited to those cases involving a public right.\nThe \"public\" rights doctrine was explored by the Supreme Court in Northern Pipeline Const. v. Marathon Pipe\nLine Co., 458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982) in which it was explained that the \"doctrine ...\ndraws upon the principal of separation of powers, and a historical understanding that certain prerogatives were\nreserved to the political Branches of Government.\" Id. at 67, 102 S.Ct. 2858. The doctrine allows Congress to\nallocate certain types of adjudicatory authority to non-Article III courts hearing cases involving those public rights\nissues historically \"reserved to the political\" branches. See, e.g., Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &\nImprovement Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 272, 15 L.Ed. 372 (1855); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76\nL.Ed. 598 (1932). While Wheeling Bridge did, in part, rely on this public rights/private rights distinction, the\ndoctrine has no place in the instant case.\nThe distinction made in Wheeling Bridge which is important to this case 00 and one to which the Supreme Court\n97\nreferred when discussing absolute \"private\" rights 00 was the distinction between prospective relief and money\n97\ndamages:\n598 *598 Now, we agree, if the remedy in this case had been an action at law, and a judgment\nrendered in favor of the plaintiff for damages, the right to these would have passed beyond the\nreach of the power of congress. It would have depended, not upon the public right of the free\nnavigation of the river, but upon the judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as it\nrespect the costs adjudged, stands upon the same principles, and is unaffected by the subsequent\nlaw. But that part of the decree, directing the abatement of the obstruction, is executory, a\ncontinuing decree, which requires not only the removal of the bridge, but enjoins the defendants\nagainst any reconstruction or continuance. Now, whether it is a future existing or continuing\nobstruction depends upon the question whether or not it interferes with the right of navigation. If, in\nthe mean time, since the decree, this right has been modified by the competent authority, so that\nthe bridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction, it is quite plain the decree of the court cannot be\nenforced.\nWheeling Bridge, 59 U.S. at 431-32 (emphasis added). It is this distinction which ultimately determines the right\nof Congress to change the law in such a way that relief must be altered or modified. The issue then is not the\nsource or validity of the legal rule producing the judgment, \"but rather the immunity from legislative abrogation of\nthose judgments themselves.\" Plaut, at 230, 115 S.Ct. 1447. The Court relied on this distinction in Plaut when it\nrejected the argument that Wheeling Bridge was precedent for Congress' right to reopen judgments. The Court\nnoted in Plaut that the statute at issue in Wheeling Bridge \"altered the prospective effect of injunctions entered by\nArticle III courts\" and that \"nothing in our holding today calls [that decision] ... into question.\" Plaut, at 232, 115\nS.Ct. 1447.\nFor purposes of this case then, the only meaningful distinction is that between judgments ordering prospective\nrelief 00 subject to alteration when Congress changes the applicable law 00 and judgments awarding damages 00\n97 97 97\nwhich cannot be reopened by Congress. The consent decree in this case provides only for prospective relief\n[13]\nCongress has changed the law governing the consent decree.  The Court therefore concludes that the PLRA\ndoes not unconstitutionally reopen a final judgment. See Dougan, 129 F.3d at 1427 (\"Consent decrees are final\njudgments but `not the last word of the judicial department'\" and are thus not final judgments for separation of\npowers purposes); Gavin v. Branstad, 122 F.3d 1081, 1088-89 (8th Cir.1997); Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v.\n[14]\nRouse, 129 F.3d 649, 656-57 (1st Cir.1997).\n\n2. Rule of Decision\nIn 1788 Alexander Hamilton wrote that \"the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited\nconstitution against legislative encroachments....\" The Federalist No. 78, 526 (Alexander Hamilton) (J.E. Cooke\ned., 1961). This principle is central to our constitutional system of government. Accordingly, Congress may not tell\na court how to decide a specific case. See United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 20 L.Ed. 519 (1871).\n599 However, Congress *599 has a great deal of freedom under Article III to limit the jurisdiction of lower courts, see,\ne.g., Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 441, 12 L.Ed. 1147 (1850) (\"[H]aving a right to prescribe, Congress may\nwithhold from any court of its creation jurisdiction of any of the enumerated controversies.\"), and, more\nimportantly for the purposes of this case, Congress has the freedom to establish standards by which a court\njudges a case. See, e.g., Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc'y, 503 U.S. 429, 112 S.Ct. 1407, 118 L.Ed.2d 73\n(1992).\nIt is true that the Constitution \"commands that the independence of the Judiciary be jealously guarded, and it\nprovides clear institutional protections for that independence,\" Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,\n458 U.S. 50, 60, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982), because the \"accumulation of all powers, legislative,\nexecutive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-\nappointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" The Federalist No. 47, 324\n(James Madison) (J.E. Cooke ed., 1961). Thus, it is the prerogative of the judiciary to declare \"what the law is,\"\nand apply that law to the facts before it. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). This clear\ndelineation of powers was the basis for the Supreme Court's holding that Congress had overstepped its\nconstitutional bounds when it dictated a rule of decision in Klein.80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 20 L.Ed. 519.\nKlein was decided during the complex political turmoil following the Civil War. A federal statute allowed citizens\nwho had been living in the Confederacy to recover property seized during the war upon proof of their loyalty to\nthe Union, which proof included a demonstration that they had not acted against the Union during the war. By\nanother act, the President was authorized to extend pardons to former Confederates. The President did so in the\ncase of V.F. Wilson whose estate, through its administrator Klein, sought to recover property confiscated by the\nUnited States. As proof of Wilson's loyalty, the claimant proffered the presidential pardon. The Court of Claims\naccepted this proof, although it also found evidence that Wilson had offered aid and comfort to Confederates\nduring the war. Nonetheless, the evidence of the pardon was held to be sufficient demonstration of loyalty and\nrestitution was ordered.\nWhile the case was pending on appeal before the Supreme Court, Congress passed a new law which provided\nthat a Presidential pardon could not be offered as proof in court where a party was advancing a claim against the\nUnited States. The statute went on to explicitly strip the Supreme Court of its appellate jurisdiction upon a finding\nthat the pardon was the basis of decision in the lower court. Faced with a statute that stripped the Court of\njurisdiction upon making certain findings, the Court held that the statute was unconstitutional, in part, because\n\"the court is forbidden to give effect to the evidence which, in its own judgment, such evidence should have, and\nis directed to give it an effect precisely contrary.\" Klein, at 147. The effect of the act, in other words, was to\n\"prescribe a rule for the decision of a cause in a particular way.\" Id. at 146.\nThe \"rule of decision\" doctrine depends on the distinction between a rule prescribing an outcome 00 which would\n97\nbe unconstitutional 00 and a change in the underlying law which may of necessity dictate a new outcome 00 which\n97 97\nwould be constitutional. Thus, in Wheeling Bridge, the Court held that Congress could change the law in such a\nway that it dictated an outcome different from the one the Court had reached in an earlier case. This distinction,\nbetween a rule of decision and a change in governing law, was further explained in Robertson v. Seattle Audubon\nSoc'y, 503 U.S. 429, 112 S.Ct. 1407, 118 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992). That case involved a legislative balance between\npreservation of endangered spotted owls and the economic needs of loggers in the Northwest. Before the change\nin law at issue in that case, two groups had challenged, in separate cases, certain logging in the Northwest on\nthe basis that the logging effectively killed or \"took\" spotted owls 00 an endangered species 00 in violation of\n97 97\nnumerous provisions of federal law. During the pendency of these suits, Congress passed legislation which\n600 expressly named the *600 two cases. See Section 318 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies\n\nAppropriations Act, 1990, 103 Stat. 745, popularly known as the Northwest Timber Compromise [the \"Timber\nAct\"]. Provisions of the Timber Act 00 section (b)(3) and (b)(5) 00 prohibited logging in designated areas. The\n97 97\nlegislation further directed that \"management of areas according to subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this section\n... is adequate consideration for the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements that are the basis [for the\npending cases].\" Section 318(b)(6)(A) of the Timber Act. The Ninth Circuit held that the Timber Act violated Article\nIII because it directed a rule of decision, that is, it dictated the outcomes of the pending cases. Seattle Audubon\nSoc'y v. Robertson, 914 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir.1990). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the provisions at\nissue merely modified or amended existing law but did not prescribe an outcome, reasoning that the courts were\nstill required to determine whether the parties met the standards of section (b)(6)(A), namely that management of\nareas was in accord with subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5). Seattle Audubon, 503 U.S. at 438, 112 S.Ct. 1407.\nThe distinction between a prescribed outcome and a mere change in governing law can be difficult to make. See,\ne.g., Benjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d at 174 (discussing difficulty of distinguishing between a change in law and a\nprescribed outcome). In the case at bar, however, the Court concludes that the statute at issue simply effects a\nconstitutionally permissible change in law. That is, the PLRA establishes a new standard, but leaves it to the\ncourts to apply that standard. In the words of the Fourth Circuit:\nWhile § 3626(b)(2) requires a district court to terminate prospective relief that was approved in the\nabsence of a finding that the relief is no greater than necessary to correct the violation of a federal\nright, it does not purport to state how much relief is more than necessary. In short, § 3626(b)(2)\nprovides only the standard to which district courts must adhere, not the result they must reach.\nPlyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365, 372 (4th Cir. 1996).\nPlaintiffs in this case could have presented evidence of a \"current and ongoing violation\" of a federal right in an\nattempt to qualify under the new standard set forth in the PLRA. Had they done so, the Court would have applied\nthe new law to the facts adduced 00 it would have determined whether the evidence established a current and\n97\nongoing violation and whether to terminate or modify relief under the PLRA. It cannot be said, therefore, that\nCongress is prescribing a rule of decision or that the PLRA is an unconstitutional encroachment on the judiciary\nbecause the Court is able to apply the provisions of the new law to the facts presented and decide what relief, if\nany, is appropriate. See also Dougan v. Singletary, 129 F.3d at 1427; Gavin v. Branstad, 122 F.3d at 1088; \nInmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d at 657-58.\nB. Due Process\n1. Vested Rights\nPlaintiffs argue that under the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, a judgment, once vested, cannot be\nabrogated by an action of Congress. See McCullough v. Virginia, 172 U.S. 102, 123-24, 19 S.Ct. 134, 43 L.Ed.\n382 (1898). While true, \"the vested rights doctrine is really only the due process analogue of separation-of-\npowers doctrine that prevents Congress from reopening final judgments of Article III courts ... [and] a judgment\nthat is not final for purposes of separation of powers is also not final for purposes of due process.\" Gavin, 122\nF.3d at 1091. Thus, the Court's discussion of final judgments in the context of separation of powers above, amply\nanswers this argument: a prospective order cannot become vested for due process purposes.\nPlaintiffs also rely on cases holding that consent decrees \"resemble\" contracts, see, e.g., Local No. 93, Int'l\nAssoc. of Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 519, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986), and analogize the\nvested right in a consent decree to rights in property which, once acquired, cannot be defeased without due\n601 process. However, injunctive relief of the type mandated by the *601 Consent Decree has a prospective effect\nand litigants have \"no `vested right' in the decree entered by the trial court.\" Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 247, 114 S.Ct.\n1483 (citing American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U.S. 184, 201, 42 S.Ct. 72, 66\nL.Ed. 189 (1921)). Moreover, \"[f]ederal regulation of future action based upon rights previously acquired by the\nperson regulated is not prohibited by the Constitution. So long as the Constitution authorizes the subsequently\n\nenacted legislation, the fact that its provisions limit or interfere with previously acquired rights does not condemn\nit.\" Fleming v. Rhodes, 331 U.S. 100, 107, 67 S.Ct. 1140, 91 L.Ed. 1368 (1947).\nThe Court therefore concludes that plaintiffs do not have a vested right in the Consent Decree under the Fifth\nAmendment. Accordingly, the PLRA, by authorizing termination of prospective relief, does not deprive plaintiffs of\nproperty without due process. See also Dougan, 129 F.3d at 1427; Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1091; Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail, 129 F.3d at 658 (holding that because a consent decree ordering prospective relief must be open to\nmodification if there is a change in law or circumstances, it cannot become vested); Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d\n[15]\n365, 374 (4th Cir.1996).\n2. Contract Rights\nPlaintiffs urge the Court to find that Congress has impermissibly impaired their contract with the Commonwealth\n00 the Consent Decree 00 in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Defendants counter that\n97 97\nthe Consent Decree is not a contract for purposes of the Due Process clause. The Court will nonetheless\nassume, without deciding, that the Consent Decree is a contract for purposes of this discussion. See Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 378, 112 S.Ct. 748 (\"A consent decree ... in some respects is contractual in nature.\").\nNormally when examining a federal statute which affects a private contract, a court must engage in a deferential\nanalysis, finding the statute unconstitutional only if it is arbitrary and irrational. See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v.\nAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 470 U.S. 451, 472, 105 S.Ct. 1441, 84 L.Ed.2d 432 (1985). Plaintiffs argue\nthat in this case, the Court should engage in heightened scrutiny because the state government, in seeking to\nterminate a decree to which it is a party, is impairing its own \"contract.\" See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan\nTransit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985). The Court rejects this invitation to\nengage in an enhanced scrutiny of the PLRA. The federal government 00 the government which enacted the\n97\nPLRA and thereby established the standard for termination 00 is clearly not a party to the Consent Decree in this\n97\ncase and where \"the Government [enacting the legislation] is not a party to the contract at issue, ... there is no\nreason to argue for a heightened standard of review.\" Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., at 472 n. 24, 105 S.Ct. 1441.\nThus, a heightened standard of review is not appropriate. Instead, the Court will examine the statute only to\ndetermine whether it is arbitrary and irrational, a test which is a Due Process equivalent of the rational basis test\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\nAs the Court explains more fully below in its discussion of plaintiffs' Equal Protection challenge, the PLRA cannot\nbe deemed to be arbitrary and irrational. Whether one agrees with the purposes motivating passage of the PLRA,\nfor the reasons stated below, it cannot be questioned that it is a rational attempt to limit the involvement of federal\ncourts in the day to day management of state prisons. The Court therefore concludes that the PLRA does not\n602 unconstitutionally impair plaintiffs' contract rights. See also Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1091-92; Inmates*602of Suffolk\nCounty Jail, 129 F.3d at 658-59.\nC. Equal Protection\nPlaintiffs next argue that the PLRA unconstitutionally violates the equal protection rights inherent in the Fifth\nAmendment. See Mathews v. De Castro, 429 U.S. 181, 182 n. 1, 97 S.Ct. 431, 50 L.Ed.2d 389 (1976) (\"It is well\nsettled that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause encompasses equal protection principles.\"). Normally, a\ncourt will presume that legislation is valid and must uphold it unless it draws a classification that is not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate purpose. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S.Ct.\n3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). On this issue, as in the context of their Due Process claim, plaintiffs urge this Court\nto employ a heightened scrutiny in this case because the PLRA acts to burden inmates' fundamental right of\naccess to the courts. \"`[C]lassifications affecting fundamental rights are given the most exacting scrutiny.' Clark v.\nJeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 S.Ct. 1910, 1914, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988) (citation omitted). Such laws must be\n`suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest.' City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440,\n105 S.Ct. 3249, 3254, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) ...\" United States v. Williams, 124 F.3d 411, 422 (3d Cir.1997)\n(other citation omitted). However, where a statutory classification or distinction \"neither burdens a fundamental\n\n[16]\nright nor targets a suspect class,  we will uphold [it] so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate\n[17]\nend.\" Romer, 116 S.Ct. at 1627.\n1. Fundamental Rights\nIt goes without saying that for equal protection purposes, access to the courts is a fundamental right. See Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 578, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Plaintiffs argue that the termination\nprovisions of the PLRA 00 by limiting the right of inmates to obtain prospective relief in a way that other classes\n97\nare not limited 00 unconstitutionally burdens this right. The Court must, however, reject this argument because the\n97\nPLRA does not close the courthouse doors to prisoners. In making this argument, plaintiffs conflate the right of\naccess with the right to relief and they are not the same thing. The PLRA does not prevent inmates from\npresenting claims of constitutional violations to a court, nor does it prevent courts from remedying any\nestablished violations; it simply limits the form and type of relief inmates may be awarded. This certainly gives\ninmates \"`a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to\nthe courts.'\" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 2180, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (quoting Bounds v.\nSmith, 430 U.S. 817, 825, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977)); see also Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1089. Thus,\nbecause the legislation does not burden a fundamental right, the Court will not engage in a strict scrutiny analysis\nof the PLRA.\n2. Rational Basis\nRational basis review is an extremely deferential form of review for it is the \"role of the political branches to shape\nthe institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.\" Lewis, 116 S.Ct.\nat 2179. A statute survives such review so long as it \"bear[s] a rational relationship to an independent and\nlegitimate legislative end.\" Romer, 116 S.Ct. at 1627. Where \"there are plausible reasons for [the legislative]\n603 action, [the court's] inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, `constitutionally *603 irrelevant whether this reasoning in\nfact underlay the legislative decision.'\" U.S. Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 179, 101 S.Ct. 453,\n66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980) (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 612, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960)).\nMoreover,\nthe burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis\nwhich might support it, whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record. Finally, courts are\ncompelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature's generalizations even when there is\nan imperfect fit between means and ends. A classification does not fail rational-basis review\nbecause it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some\ninequality.\nHeller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319-21, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993).\nA discernable 00 and legitimate 00 purpose of the PLRA is to preserve \"state sovereignty by protecting states from\n97 97\noverzealous supervision by the federal courts in the area of prison conditions litigation.\" Plyler, 100 F.3d at 374.\nThis purpose is borne out by the PLRA's legislative history, which recites:\nthat the drafters intended the Act to `address the alarming explosion in the number of frivolous\nlawsuits filed by State and Federal prisoners,' to `mak[e] it much more difficult for Federal judges\nto issue orders directing the release of convicted criminals from prison custody,' 141 Cong. Rec.\n14,413 (1995) (statement of Sen. Dole), and to wrest control of state penitentiaries from federal\ncourts so that states `will be able to run the prisons as they see fit unless there is a constitutional\nviolation,' id. at 14,419 (statement of Sen. Abraham).\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, 129 F.3d at 660. The legislative history thus more than adequately demonstrates\nat least one legitimate goal: the desire to limit federal court oversight of state prisons. The way Congress has\nchosen to reach this goal 00 the PLRA 00 is a perfectly rational means to that end. The PLRA therefore amply\n97 97\nsatisfies the rational basis test.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that in passing the PLRA, Congress was motivated by an animus toward inmates and that where\na statute \"singl[es] out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal status or general hardship[],\" Romer, 116\nS.Ct. at 1628, it violates the equal protection clause. Plaintiffs have thus teased from the holding in Romer a new\nconstitutional standard of review in equal protection cases, something greater than the rational basis test\ndescribed above. The Court does not believe that the Supreme Court established a new standard, for it found\nthat the only purpose of the statute at issue in that case was animus toward homosexuals, which is simply not\nlegitimate:\nEven laws enacted for broad and ambitious purposes often can be explained by reference to\nlegitimate public policies which justify the incidental disadvantages they impose on certain\npersons. Amendment 2 [the law at issue], however, in making a general announcement that gays\nand lesbians shall not have any particular protections from the law, inflicts on them immediate,\ncontinuing, and real injuries that outrun and belie any legitimate justifications that may be claimed\nfor it. We conclude that, in addition to the far-reaching deficiencies of Amendment 2 that we have\nnoted, the principles it offends, in another sense, are conventional and venerable; a law must bear\na rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose ... and Amendment 2 does not.\nRomer, at 1628-29. The PLRA does not have the same sweeping effect, for § 3626(b) simply narrows the\nprotections afforded inmates to the constitutional minimum, it does not eliminate those protections.\nEven if plaintiffs are correct, however, and courts must engage in a form of heightened scrutiny where there is\nevidence of some animus, the discussion of the legislative history above sufficiently demonstrates legitimate\n604 reasons for the PLRA; plaintiffs have not come forward with evidence that animus was the principal motivating \n[18]\n*604 factor.  Moreover, it has been established that in some contexts states may, without violating the equal\nprotection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, impose greater burdens on inmates as a class; while\nprisoners are certainly not stripped of all constitutional rights by the fact of their incarceration, see, e.g., Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-85, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), those rights may be limited and, in some\ncases, eliminated. See, e.g., Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24, 54, 94 S.Ct. 2655, 41 L.Ed.2d 551 (1974)\n(holding that convicted felons who have served their time may be disenfranchised by the state without violating\nthe Fourteenth Amendment). In this case, the burden imposed by the PLRA 00 that inmates prove a \"current and\n97\nongoing violation\" of a federal right 00 is not unreasonable and does not violate the equal protection rights of\n97\ninmates. For all these reasons, the Court concludes that the PLRA does not violate the plaintiffs' equal protection\nrights. See also Dougan, 129 F.3d at 1427; Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1089-90; Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 129 F.3d\nat 659-61; Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365, 373-74 (4th Cir.1996).\nIII. MOTIONS FOR CONTEMPT\nHaving concluded that the termination provisions of the PLRA at issue are constitutional, the next question for the\nCourt is what effect a finding of contempt will have on defendants' Motion to Terminate. Plaintiffs contend that\nregardless of the constitutionality of the termination provisions, if the Court finds defendants in contempt, it may\nstay defendants Motion to Terminate or hold it in abeyance until the contempt is purged. The Court may do so,\nplaintiffs argue, either pursuant to its inherent contempt power or through the equitable doctrine of \"unclean\n[19]\nhands.\"\n\"[I]t is firmly established that `[t]he power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts.' [Ex Parte Robinson, 19\nWall. 505, 510, 22 L.Ed. 205 (1873) ]. This power reaches both conduct before the court and that beyond the\ncourt's confines, for `[t]he underlying concern that gave rise to the contempt power was not ... merely the\ndisruption of court proceedings. Rather, it was disobedience to the orders of the Judiciary, regardless of whether\nsuch disobedience interfered with the conduct of trial.'\" Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 44, 111 S.Ct.\n2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (quoting Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481 U.S. 787, 798, 107\nS.Ct. 2124, 95 L.Ed.2d 740 (1987)). This inherent contempt power is not unlimited, however. Indeed, \"[b]ecause\nof their very potency, inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion.\" Id. (citing Roadway\n\nExpress, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980)). Moreover, although the power\nto hold one in contempt is exercised at a court's discretion, it is not exercised absent standards.\nThe Third Circuit recently enunciated an important limit on the imposition of civil contempt sanctions in Harris v.\n605 City of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1311 (3d Cir.1995). *605 Unhappy with overcrowding at a Philadelphia prison, a\ngroup of inmates filed a civil rights complaint in 1982, alleging that prison conditions violated various provisions of\nthe United States Constitution. In 1986, the suit was expanded to include the entire Philadelphia prison system.\nLater that year, the inmates entered into a settlement agreement with the City in which the City agreed to\nconstruct new prisons and to do so according to a specified schedule. This agreement was approved by the court\nin the form of a consent decree that same year. A second consent decree was approved by the Court in 1991,\nafter it became clear that the conditions of the 1986 decree were not going to be met, and a further amendment\nwas stipulated in 1992. The provisions of the 1991 consent decree and its amendment were at issue in Harris.\nIn Harris, the district court imposed civil contempt sanctions; the sanctions arose out of the failure of the City to\nsubmit two planning documents by a specified date. When it failed to submit those documents, the district court \nsua sponte found \"a pattern of contempt\" by the City, imposed fines and ordered the documents submitted. After\nthe City again failed to submit the documents 00 having received an extension of time for submission of one of\n97\nthem 00 the district court imposed a second contempt sanction. This second sanction imposed by the court\n97\nagainst the City was dismissal of its pending motion to modify the consent decree. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, the Third Circuit held that this sanction exceeded the authority of the district court.\nThe plaintiffs cite Harris for the proposition that \"[a] party may not rely on its unilateral interpretation of the\nrequirements for compliance in complex institutional reform litigation as an excuse for noncompliance,\" id. at\n1325 (citation omitted), and argue that by amending the clothing regulations and review procedures, defendants\nhave done just that. Defendants note, however, that Harris also stands for the proposition that civil contempt\nsanctions must exert a coercive, rather than punitive, effect. Thus, \"[i]f the contemnor cannot purge through an\naffirmative act, the sanction has no coercive effect and exceeds the appropriate bounds of civil contempt.\" Id. at\n1328. Although civil contempt can also serve to compensate, the Third Circuit in Harris found that dismissal of the\nmotion to modify was neither coercive nor compensatory and instead was purely punitive, an inappropriate basis\nupon which to issue a sanction for civil contempt. See also Robin Woods Inc. v. Woods, 28 F.3d 396, 400 (3d\nCir.1994) (\"Sanctions for civil contempt serve two purposes: `to coerce the defendant into compliance with the\ncourt's order and to compensate for losses sustained by the disobedience.'\" (quoting McDonald's Corp. v. Victory\nInvestments, 727 F.2d 82, 87 (3d Cir.1984))); Gregory v. Depte, 896 F.2d 31, 34 (3d Cir.1990) (\"We first consider\nwhether this contempt sanction may be justified as civil. Such a sanction must coerce or compensate.\").\nPlaintiffs seek to have defendants ordered into compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree. In doing so,\nthey maintain that the Court may either dismiss defendants' Motion to Terminate, or hold that Motion in abeyance\nuntil defendants purge their contempt. It is clear, however, that should this Court find defendants in contempt, it\nmay not sanction them unless the sanction is capable of either coercing compliance, or of compensating plaintiffs\nfor past violations. Defendants argue that Harris is precisely on point on this issue. Ordering their Motion to\nTerminate dismissed or held in abeyance, they argue, would impose a sanction which is purely punitive.\nThe Third Circuit in Harris concluded that the sanction of dismissing the motion to modify was not \"designed to\nhave a coercive effect impelling the City to submit at long last the tardy [documents] ..., because it had no\nprovision explicitly permitting the City to refile the motion once the documents were submitted.\" Harris, 47 F.3d at\n1329. The court apparently, therefore, left open the possibility that had the dismissal of the motion to modify been\nwithout prejudice 00 allowing the City to re-file after complying with the order 00 the sanction would have had a\n97 97\n606 coercive effect and thus would have fit within the framework of civil contempt. If so, it *606 might be argued that\nin this case, holding defendants' Motion to Terminate in abeyance, or dismissing it without prejudice, would have\na coercive effect since defendants would be able to seek termination of the Consent Decree under the PLRA,\nafter coming into compliance.\nWhile at first blush, this argument seems plausible, the Court must reject it. The power to hold one in contempt is\nan equitable one and as such, \"where the purpose is to make the defendant comply, the [court] ... must then\nconsider the character and magnitude of the harm threatened by continued contumacy, and the probable\neffectiveness of any suggested sanction in bringing about the result desired.\" United States v. United Mine\n\nWorkers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 304, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). In other words, there must be a\nbalancing of the equities.\nKeeping in mind first, that the Court has found the termination provisions of the PLRA to be constitutional, and\nsecond, that plaintiffs have not attempted to establish the facts necessary to meet the standard which would\npermit the Court to deny defendants' Motion to Terminate, the Court concludes that requiring defendants to\ncomply with the terms of the Consent Decree at this time would be little more than an empty gesture. Accepting, \narguendo, plaintiffs' position, and considering the Court's conclusion regarding the PLRA's constitutionality, as\nsoon as defendants came into compliance, the Decree would lose all force in federal court under the terms of an\norder entered pursuant to the termination provisions of the PLRA. Thus, such an action on the part of the Court\nwould not only be a Pyrrhic victory for plaintiffs, it would, in practice, be a punishment of the defendants: the\neffect would merely be to temporarily force defendants into a possibly costly compliance with rules and\nprocedures they will immediately thereafter be in a position to abandon or restructure. This neither aids plaintiffs,\nnor compels defendants, and the Court will not order it.\nIn this respect, the Third Circuit's opinion in Latrobe Steel Co. v. United Steelworkers, 545 F.2d 1336 (1976), is\ninstructive. In that case, the district court had issued an injunction prohibiting a union from refusing to cross a\n\"stranger picket line.\" When union members failed to comply with the order, the district court sanctioned the union\nin the form of fines payable to the United States. On appeal, the circuit court found that the district court lacked\njurisdiction to issue the underlying injunction. The question then became whether a contempt sanction can\nsurvive the invalidation of the order the contemnors were charged with violating. After concluding that the ordered\nsanction was civil in nature, and that the purpose of the civil sanction was to coerce compliance with the order the\ncourt concluded that \"coercive contempt cannot survive the overturning of the underlying injunctive order....\" Id. at\n1348.\nMoreover, there is precedent for refusing to impose a coercive contempt sanction when a change in law\ninvalidates a court order, even where the alleged contemnor has flagrantly ignored that order. In Wheeling Bridge\n(discussed above) the Supreme Court refused both to enjoin reconstruction of the bridge and to sanction the\nbridge builders for their disobedience of the lower court order enjoining reconstruction:\nA motion is now made for attachments against the persons mentioned for this disobedience and\ncontempt.\nA majority of the court are of opinion, inasmuch as we have arrived at the conclusion that the act\nof congress afforded full authority to the defendants to reconstruct the bridge, and the decree\ndirecting its alteration or abatement could not, therefore, be carried into execution after the\nenactment of this law, and inasmuch as the granting of an attachment for the disobedience is a\nquestion resting in the discretion of the court, that, under all the circumstances of the case, the\nmotion should be denied.\n[20]\nId. at 436.\n607 A somewhat different issue is raised with respect to plaintiffs request for compensatory *607 sanctions for\nviolation of the clothing provisions of the Consent Decree. The Latrobe Steel court explains that:\nAlthough the cases do not fully explicate the reasoning behind the general principle that\ncompensatory civil contempt does not survive the abrogation of the underlying decree, the precept\nis, in our opinion, a sound one. A compensatory contempt proceeding is similar in several\nparticulars to an ordinary damage action, since it is in essence an action between private parties,\nwith rights created by the injunctive order rather than by a statute or the common law. The\ninvalidation of an injunction in such a setting is equivalent to a holding that the plaintiff never had a\nlegally cognizable interest which the defendant was obliged to respect, a conclusion which should\nbe distinguished from the nearly unconditional duty of obedience owed by a defendant to a court.\nThe United Mine Workers' doctrine thus recognizes that a private party should not profit as a\nresult of an order to which a court determines, in retrospect, he was never entitled.\n\nLatrobe Steel, 545 F.2d at 1345-46. In this case, unlike Latrobe Steel, the Court will merely terminate the\nprospective effect of the Consent Decree; it is not finding that \"the plaintiff[s] never had a legally cognizable\ninterest\" in the Decree. Thus, Latrobe Steel does not answer the issue presented by plaintiffs' request for\ncompensatory sanctions: the question of whether, if, by violating the clothing provisions of the Decree,\ndefendants have deprived plaintiffs of a right, plaintiffs are entitled to compensation by reason of the loss of that\nright even if the Decree is thereafter terminated. Neither can the Court rely on Harris to find that imposition of\ncompensatory sanctions would be a form of punishment 00 compensatory damages, by their very nature, are not\n97\npunitive. The Court will therefore make findings with respect to plaintiffs' claim that they are entitled to\ncompensation by reason of the amendments to the clothing regulations unilaterally imposed on them by\ndefendants in violation of the Consent Decree.\nThe Consent Decree provides that \"[d]efendants shall permit residents to wear civilian clothing when the\nresidents are housed in general population except to the extent that the superintendent of each institution\nrequires institutional issue to be worn for work. However, defendants reserve the right to require residents to wear\nspecific articles of clothing issued solely for the purpose of visitation during a resident's presence in the visiting\nareas of the institution. Furthermore, defendants reserve the right to impose reasonable regulations with respect\nto civilian clothing on the basis of safety, sanitary and security considerations.\" Consent Decree ¶ XVII (emphasis\nadded).\nDefendants have presented evidence that, after the escape of six inmates, they amended the clothing regulations\nout of a concern for the safety of the public and security of correctional institutions. Plaintiffs argue that this\nconcern was not a primary motivating factor for the change in regulation. A report released by Commissioner\nHorn detailed \"Primary Causes of Escape\" and \"security lapses that allowed escape.\" The parties have stipulated\nthat \"[t]he issue of inmate access to civilian clothing is listed only thereafter in the report as a concern related to\nthe escape.\" Stipulation of Uncontested Fact at ¶ 14. Defendants cite this security concern as a principal reason\nfor the change in clothing policy.\nThe Consent Decree does not require that safety and security concerns be the sole or even primary motivating\nfactor. It expressly reserves to defendants the right to alter clothing regulations if the alteration is \"reasonable\"\nand the concern for safety or security is a \"basis\" of the alteration. See id. at ¶¶ 9-14 (detailing Report of\nCommissioner Horn on escape of prisoners). In this case, the fact that inmates' possession of civilian clothing\n608 contributed to the escape is ample proof that the defendants' safety and security *608 concerns are \"reasonable.\"\nThe Court further finds that those concerns served as one of the bases for the amendment to the clothing\nregulations. The Court therefore concludes that defendants have not violated the Consent Decree with respect to\nthe amended clothing regulations and will not order compensatory sanctions.\nIn light of the Court's earlier conclusion 00 that even had defendants violated other provisions of the Consent\n97\nDecree it will not hold them in contempt for the purpose of making them comply with those provisions of the\nDecree 00 the Court will not make findings as to whether defendants have violated any other provisions of the\n97\n[21]\nConsent Decree or its amendments.  Although the Consent Decree has not yet been terminated, absent a\nfinding of a \"current and ongoing\" violation of a federal right00which plaintiffs have expressly declined to attempt\n97\nto establish 00 the Court must promptly terminate the Decree.\n97\nIV. APPLICATION OF THE EQUITABLE DOCTRINE OF \"UNCLEAN\nHANDS\"\nRelying on their contentions with respect to defendants' contempt, plaintiffs assert that defendants are invoking\nthe termination provisions of the PLRA with \"unclean hands.\" Thus, even if the Court will not order contempt\nsanctions in this case, the question remains whether defendants may be barred, under the doctrine of \"unclean\nhands\" 00 from seeking the equitable relief of termination of the Consent Decree pursuant to the PLRA's\n97\ntermination provisions. A court acts out of concern for its own integrity when it refuses to hear a claim because\nthe party seeking relief enters with \"unclean hands.\" See Gaudiosi v. Mellon, 269 F.2d 873, 881-882 (3d Cir.1959)\n. To succeed with the defense of \"unclean hands,\" the conduct of the party seeking relief must be inequitable and\n\nmust involve the subject matter of his or her claim. See Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., Inc., 747\nF.2d 844, 855 (3d Cir.1984). \"What is material is not that the plaintiffs hands are dirty, but that he dirtied them in\nacquiring the right he now asserts, or that the manner of dirtying renders inequitable the assertion of such rights\nagainst the defendant.\" Carney v. School District of Philadelphia, 633 F.Supp. 1273, 1285 (E.D.Pa.1986), This\ndoctrine has been defined as barring a claim \"only if `(1) a party seeking affirmative relief (2) is guilty of conduct\ninvolving fraud, deceit, unconscionability, or bad faith (3) directly related to the matter in issue (4) that injures the\nother party and (5) affects the balance of equities between the litigants.'\" Tang v. Hwang, 799 F.Supp. 499, 505\n(E.D.Pa.1992) (quoting Castle v. Cohen, 676 F.Supp. 620, 627 (E.D.Pa. 1987),aff'd in part and remanded in part\non other grounds,840 F.2d 173 (3d Cir.1988)).\nFederal courts clearly retain broad equitable powers under the doctrine of \"unclean hands.\" See, e.g., Precision\nInstrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324 U.S. 806, 814-15, 65 S.Ct. 993, 89 L.Ed.\n1381 (1945) (\"The guiding doctrine in this case is the equitable maxim that `he who comes into equity must come\nwith clean hands.' ... This maxim necessarily gives wide range to the equity court's use of discretion in refusing to\naid the unclean litigant.\") (affirming dismissal of patent suit in which plaintiff entered court with \"unclean hands\").\nA court may exercise those powers in many circumstances, even in cases in which a party is proceeding under\nstatute. Of course, the requirement remains that the misconduct alleged by those invoking \"unclean hands\" must\nrelate to the subject matter of the statute at issue. See Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385, 393, 68 S.Ct. 1156, 92\nL.Ed. 1460 (1948).\nIn the context of congressionally created injunctive remedies, the Supreme Court has said that \"[u]nless a statute\n609 in so *609 many words, or by a necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity,\nthe full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.\" Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395,\n398, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 90 L.Ed. 1332 (1946) (absent a \"clear and valid legislative command\" courts retain their\npowers of equity). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982).\nCourts may, nonetheless, be barred by statute from exercising some or all of their equitable powers. See, e.g., \nOperating Engineers Local Union 3 v. Burroughs, 417 F.2d 370 (9th Cir.1969) (holding that \"unclean hands\"\ndefense was not available where union employee sought relief under federal statute but had failed to exhaust\nunion remedies); United States v. Martell, 844 F.Supp. 454 (N.D.Ind. 1994) (holding that doctrine of \"unclean\nhands\" does not apply when proceeding under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and\nLiability Act (\"CERCLA\") because the \"unclean hands\" doctrine cannot be used to frustrate the law or public\npolicy). The Third Circuit has also been reluctant to find an \"unclean hands\" exception in statutes. Thus, when the\ngovernment argued that there was an implied \"unclean hands\" exception to the statute prohibiting introduction of\nunlawfully obtained wire tap evidence to the grand jury, the Third Circuit held that no such exception applied. See\nIn re Grand Jury, 111 F.3d 1066, 1077 (3d Cir.1997); see also Smith Land & Improvement Corp. v. Celotex Corp.,\n851 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir.1988) (holding that \"doctrines such as caveat emptor and `clean hands,' which in some\ncases could bar relief regardless of the degree of culpability of the parties, do not comport with congressional\nobjectives\" as codified in CERCLA and thus do not apply under that statute).\nThe Supreme Court has also recently spoken to this issue. In McKennon v. Nashville Banner Pub. Co., 513 U.S.\n352, 115 S.Ct. 879, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995), the plaintiff, Christine McKennon, sought a remedy under the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), a statute which explicitly provides that a court has discretion to\n\"grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purpose of [the Act].\" 29 U.S.C. § 626\n(b). After firing her for purportedly illegitimate reasons, her former employer discovered that McKennon had\n[22]\nengaged in conduct that would have provided legitimate grounds for dismissal.  This evidence, they claimed,\nbarred her from proceeding under the ADEA, a form of \"unclean hands.\"\nThe Supreme Court in McKennon held that the reason the employer had initially given for firing McKennon was in\nviolation of the ADEA. It then went on to refuse consideration of the \"unclean hands\" doctrine. \"Equity's maxim\nthat a suitor who engaged in his own reprehensible conduct in the course of the transaction at issue must be\ndenied equitable relief because of `unclean hands,' a rule which in conventional formulation operated in limine to\nbar the suitor from seeking the aid of the equity court, .. has not been applied where Congress authorizes broad\nequitable relief to serve important national policies.\" Id. at 360, 115 S.Ct. 879 (emphasis added). Thus the Court\nhas \"rejected the unclean hands defense `where a private suit serves important public purposes.'\" Id. (quoting \nPerma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 138, 88 S.Ct. 1981, 20 L.Ed.2d 982 (1968)\n\n(holding that \"unclean hands\" defense does not apply in Sherman Act and Clayton Act Antitrust actions)); see\nalso Pan-American Petroleum & Transport Co. v. United States, 273 U.S. 456, 47 S.Ct. 416, 71 L.Ed. 734 (1927)\n(rules of equity \"will not be applied so as to frustrate purpose of laws or thwart public policy\").\nThe PLRA serves important national policies, and because barring defendants' Motion to Terminate under the\ndoctrine of \"unclean hands\" would serve to frustrate the purpose of the law and thwart public policy, the Court\nconcludes that plaintiffs may not invoke the \"unclean hands\" doctrine to bar defendants' Motion to Terminate.\n610  V. RELIEF\n*610\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3), a court should not terminate relief if it finds that there is a \"current and ongoing\nviolation of the Federal right\" and that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary and is the\nleast intrusive means possible to correct the violation. The statute clearly defines prospective relief as \"all relief\nother than compensatory monetary damages,\" id. § 3626(g)(7) and relief is further defined to include \"consent\ndecrees.\" Id. § 3626(g)(9). In combination with the legislative history discussed above, the Court concludes that\nthe statute is unambiguous: pursuant to the PLRA, consent decrees are to be \"terminated\" upon motion unless\nthere is a showing of \"current and ongoing violations\" of a federal right.\nBecause the Court has determined that the termination provisions of the PLRA are constitutional, because it has\ndenied the contempt motions, and because it will not bar defendants' Motion to Terminate under the doctrine of\n\"unclean hands,\" the Court will terminate the Consent Decree under the provisions of the PLRA. In applying\nthese provisions, the Court will follow the literal language of the statute and \"terminate\" the decree, not vacate it.\nThe Second Circuit in Benjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 1997),reh'g held en banc February 25, 1998,\n[23]\n after a complicated analysis of the language of the PLRA, chose to read § 3626 of the Act such that \"the\nstatutory definition of relief, which includes consent decrees, should preferably be read to mean that it includes\nremedies arising out of or issued pursuant to the consent decree,\" but not the consent decree itself. Id. at 168.\nThe consequence of this interpretation is that the obligations and agreements under the consent decree are left\nintact, even when the relief ordered by the decree is terminated. Otherwise stated, the Benjamin court held that\nthe PLRA merely strips federal court of jurisdiction over non-federal remedies. With this understanding of the\ntermination provisions, the court in Benjamin proceeded to find the PLRA constitutional, noting, however, in\nseveral instances that that conclusion was \"predicated on our interpretation of the termination provision as\nlimiting federal jurisdiction over the non-federal aspects of the Consent Decrees rather than as making those\naspects of the Decrees void.\" Id. at 170.\nWhile the Court does not adopt this interpretation of the PLRA's termination provisions, \"Congress chose to use\nthe verb `terminate' and to eschew the verb `vacate.' The distinction between these two words is clear:\n`terminate' means `to put an end to' or `to end,' Black's Law Dictionary at 1471, whereas `vacate' means `to\nannul' or `to render ... void,' id. at 1548.\" Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 129 F.3d at 662. As the First Circuit has\nnoted, \"this distinction may well possess practical significance.\" Id.; See also Benjamin, 124 F.3d at 178-79.\nWhile terminating the Consent Decree ends its future injunctive effect, the decree itself is not \"annulled,\" as it\nwould be if it were vacated. The Court will therefore, as it has said, \"terminate\" and not \"vacate\" the Decree.\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Court must turn to plaintiffs' alternative requests: to have this Court \"certify\"\ntransfer to the Commonwealth Court and \"not divest jurisdiction\" pending any action in state court. This latter\nrequest will be treated as one to stay implementation of the termination order. Plaintiffs seek to have this case\ntransferred so as to give them an opportunity to attempt to enforce the Consent Decree under state law, free of\nthe termination requirement of the PLRA. Plaintiffs point to no statute or rule which would authorize this Court to\n\"certify\" such a transfer and it declines to do so. Nonetheless, the Court recognizes that plaintiffs may have valid\narguments that the Consent Decree creates binding obligations under state law 00 although it expresses no\n97\nopinion as to the merits of such arguments. It will therefore examine the question of whether the Court should\nstay termination of the Decree pending either state court action or appeal of this decision.\n611 *611 After engaging in the analysis outlined above, the Second Circuit in Benjamin concluded that it was\nappropriate to maintain a stay, keeping the consent decree at issue in that case in force. Mindful that the issues\n\nat stake in the litigation before it had closely divided those courts which had addressed them, the Second Circuit\nordered the stay maintained \"until the Supreme Court has acted on any possible petition for certiorari.\" Id. at 180.\nAlthough in one respect this Court reaches an outcome not too dissimilar from that of the Second Circuit, the\nCourt must respectfully disagree with this part of the Second Circuit's holding and will not order a stay in this\ncase. Because the statute is unambiguous on this point and the Court has concluded that the termination\nprovisions of the PLRA are constitutional, the Court will not stay termination of the Decree.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nBased on all of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the termination provisions of the PLRA are constitutional\nand therefore grants defendants their requested relief. The Consent Decree will be terminated. The Court also\nhas determined that plaintiffs' contempt motions should be denied. Plaintiffs have requested two types of\ncontempt sanctions and the reasons for denying their motions are likewise twofold: with respect to the request for\ncoercive sanctions, the Court has concluded that in the circumstances of this case, such sanctions would be\npunitive in nature and thus will not impose coercive sanctions regardless of whether defendants have violated\nprovisions of the Consent Decree; with respect to the request for compensatory sanctions arising from\ndefendants' amendment of the clothing regulations, the same reasoning does not apply and the Court therefore\naddressed that claimed contempt and found that the amendment to the clothing regulations did not violate the\nConsent Decree. The Court additionally declines to bar defendants' Motion to Terminate based on the equitable\ndoctrine of \"unclean hands.\" Finally, the Court will neither stay termination in this case, nor order the case\ntransferred to the Commonwealth Court.\nAn appropriate order follows.\nORDER\nAND NOW, to wit, this 27th day of April, 1998, upon consideration of defendants' Motion to Terminate All\nOutstanding Orders for Prospective Relief pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110\nStat. 1321 (1996) (codified in part at 18 U.S.C. § 3626), filed September 23, 1997 (Doc.

No. 805), after oral argument on November 19,\n612 1997, for the *612 reasons set forth in the attached Memorandum, IT IS ORDERED as follows:\n1. The termination provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2), are\nconstitutional.\n2. Because the Court has found the termination provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18\nU.S.C. § 3626(b)(2), to be constitutional and because plaintiffs have not made a factual showing\nof a current and ongoing violation of a federal right as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act,\nDefendants' Motion to Terminate All Outstanding Orders for Prospective Relief is GRANTED and\nthe Consent Decree, as amended, is TERMINATED.\n\n3. Plaintiff's Motion in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Terminate Preliminary Relief and in the\nAlternative to Declare the Prison Litigation Reform Act Unconstitutional is DENIED.\n4. Plaintiff's Motion to Certify the Transfer of this Action's Consent Decree with Related Orders to\nthe Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania is DENIED.\n5. Plaintiff's Motion to Have Defendants and Their Agents Held in Civil Contempt and Amended\nMotion for Contempt are DENIED.\n[1] The Amended Motion for Contempt supplements plaintiffs' Motion to Have Defendants and Their Agents Held\nin Civil Contempt. The Court will hereinafter refer to these two Motions as plaintiffs' contempt motions.\n[2] SCI Graterford, SCI Muncy, SCI Rockview, SCI Huntingdon, SCI Dallas, SCI Camp Hill, and SCI Pittsburgh.\n[3] These include a 1980 Stipulation (approved January 8, 1980), a 1981 Stipulation (approved May 13, 1983), a\n1981 Amendment to Stipulation (approved May 13, 1983), and a 1982 Agreement (approved May 13, 1983).\n[4] Prior to enactment of the PLRA, it is unlikely that a court would have made such findings in any case involving\na consent decree. No law prior to the PLRA required such findings and because a consent decree embodies an\nagreement between the parties, there would have been no need for such findings. This case is no exception: no\nfindings meeting the standards of the PLRA were made with respect to the Consent Decree or its amendments.\n[5] On November 27, 1997, the PLRA was amended by Pub.L. No. 105-119, § 123, 111 Stat. 2440 (1997) which,\namong other provisions, replaced \"current or ongoing violation\" with \"current and ongoing violation.\" Congress\nprovided that the amendments \"shall take effect upon the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to\npending cases.\" Id. at § 123(b).\n[6] Under the November 27, 1997 amendments, parties may now bring a mandamus action \"for any failure to\nissue a prompt ruling....\" Pub.L. No. 105-119, § 123(a)(3)(A) (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3626(e)(1)).\n[7] The Order of May 11, 1983 was signed by Judge Lord. Defendants have noted, however, that neither the\nCourt, the Clerks office nor any party have a copy of the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation which bears the\nsignature of Judge Lord, although all copies of the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation do bear the signatures of the\nparty representatives. Defendants suggest that the failure of Judge Lord to sign the Amendment to Stipulation\ncasts its legitimacy into question. The Court rejects this argument. All parties have, since 1983, treated the\nAmendment to Stipulation as binding; all parties signed it; Magistrate Judge Hall clearly recommended that it be\napproved and Judge Lord just as clearly approved it. The Court shall, therefore, treat it as a binding amendment\nto the Consent Decree.\n[8] Plaintiffs initially agreed to this new streamlined procedure, but withdrew their agreement because of concerns\nthat the proposed procedure would limit the right of inmates to appeal adverse decisions to the Commonwealth\nCourt under Kisner v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 683 A.2d 353, 355-56 (Pa.Commw.1996) (holding that the\nCentral Office Review Committee performed \"state-wide policy making functions\" and thus its decisions are\nappealable to the Commonwealth Court). For the reasons discussed in Part III of this Memorandum, the Court\nwill not address this issue.\n[9] The Consent Decree provides that \"[p]laintiff's ... reserve the right to contest in this Court, at any time, by any\nappropriate legal proceeding, any institution or system wide pattern of failure or refusal by the defendants or their\nagents or employees to follow the provisions of this Consent Decree.\" Consent Decree ¶ XIX (emphasis added).\nThe Decree also states that the \"Decree shall not create a private cause of action in any individual against any of\nthe defendants. Nor, except as provided in paragraph XIX above, shall this decree provide a basis for contempt\nproceedings.\" Consent Decree ¶ XXIII.\n[10] Six members of the plaintiff class 00 Jon E. Yount, David S. Kopac, Derek S. Smith, Guy Bicking, James Alan\n97\nRomberger, and Kenneth W. Teater 00 submitted Plaintiffs' Objections to Portions of \"Stipulation of Uncontested\n97\nFacts,\" filed December 16, 1997 (Doc.No.828) in which they alleged that \"agents\" for the defendants delayed\n\ntheir receipt of the Stipulation of Uncontested Facts. As a result, they could not timely inform their counsel of\nalleged errors in the Stipulation. They have two principal sets of objections. The first is that there are\ndiscrepancies and errors in the facts regarding the clothing regulations. These alleged discrepancies and errors\nare used to support an argument that defendants have amended the clothing regulations, not as a safety\nmeasure, but, because the newly required clothing is manufactured at a correctional institution, as a fiscal one.\nPlaintiffs' counsel did not advance this argument and has not moved to amend the contempt motions. By\nseparate Order dated April 27, 1998, the Court has overruled this first set of objections. The second principal set\nof objections asserted by the above-named plaintiffs involves the conduct of sick calls 00 addressed in more detail\n97\nbelow in the body of the Memorandum. At the request of plaintiffs' counsel, the Court has included this claim in its\nconsideration of plaintiffs' contempt motions. See Id.\n[11] The Court granted the requested relief by separate Orders dated April 27, 1998.\n[12] To date, six circuits have examined similar attacks on the constitutionality of the PLRA. Five of the six have\nrejected arguments like those presented by plaintiffs in the case at bar. See Hadix v. Johnson, 133 F.3d 940 (6th\nCir.1998); Gavin v. Branstad, 122 F.3d 1081, 1088-89 (8th Cir.1997); Dougan v. Singletary 129 F.3d 1424, 1427\n(11th Cir.1997); Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 656-57 (1st Cir. 1997); Plyler v. Moore,\n100 F.3d 365, 372 (4th Cir.1996). The Second Circuit, although holding in the face of similar arguments that the\nPLRA is constitutional, did so only after construing the language of the termination provision as requiring only\ntermination of relief, not of the decree itself. See Benjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.1997),reh'g held en\nbanc February 25, 1998. The Third Circuit has yet to speak to these issues.\n[13] Plaintiffs contend that because the Consent Decree settled a suit challenging the constitutionality of prison\npractices, Congress in establishing termination procedures, is altering the constitutional basis for the relief\nawarded, which it may not do. The Court rejects this argument. Congress has not attempted to alter the\nconstitutional basis of relief; indeed, under the PLRA plaintiffs are free to establish violations of a federal right\nwhich includes constitutional rights. They have not done so in this case.\n[14] Plaintiffs urge the Court to examine the history of Article III, as Justice Scalia did in Plaut, and argue that by\ndoing so, it must conclude that the intent of the Framers was precisely to avoid the type of legislative\nentanglement in the judiciary as is represented by the PLRA. Indeed, it is true that the \"sense of sharp necessity\nto separate the legislative from the judicial power, prompted by the crescendo of legislative interference with\nprivate judgments of the courts, triumphed among the Framers of the new Federal Constitution.\" Plaut, 514 U.S.\nat 220, 115 S.Ct. 1447. The abuses of pre-Revolutionary legislatures, however, were of the type found in Plaut:\nlegislative reversals of final judicial decisions. The Court cannot find a compelling reason in this, albeit\nfascinating, history to alter its conclusion that the Consent Decree is not a final judgment for separation of powers\npurposes.\n[15] Plaintiffs again make the public rights/private rights distinction in the context of their due process argument.\nThey cite Hodges v. Snyder, 261 U.S. 600, 603, 43 S.Ct. 435, 67 L.Ed. 819 (1923), which limits the holding in \nMcCullough 00 that once vested, a judgment cannot be abrogated by an act of Congress 00 by stating that for Due\n97 97\nProcess purposes, public rights may not become vested, only private rights. This issue is not implicated in this\ncase, however, for if a party can have no property right in the underlying order 00 the order is not final for due\n97\nprocess purposes 00 it matters not whether it confers a public or a private right because it cannot become vested\n97\nin either case. See Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1091 n. 10.\n[16] Plaintiffs do not contend that inmates are a suspect class.\n[17] In the context of their equal protection arguments, plaintiffs assert that the PLRA violates the Tenth\nAmendment by limiting the right of state officials to settle litigation. See United States v. Bekins, 304 U.S. 27,\n51-52, 58 S.Ct. 811, 82 L.Ed. 1137 (1938) (\"It is of the essence of sovereignty to be able to make contracts and\ngive consents bearing upon the exertion of government power.\"). The Court rejects this contention. The PLRA\ndoes not prohibit states from entering into \"private settlement agreements.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(c)(2). Instead, the\nPLRA merely limits the jurisdiction of federal courts with respect to enforcement of such agreements. Thus, state\nsovereignty is in no way threatened by the PLRA.\n\n[18] Plaintiffs argued that this district is uniquely situated to understand that animus to prisoners motivated\npassage of the PLRA because congressional unhappiness with Harris v. City of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1311 (3d\nCir.1995), served as a catalyst for the PLRA's enactment. The Court does not doubt that prisoners are\nconsidered by the public to be an unpopular class and that such unpopularity helped usher the PLRA through\nCongress. Nonetheless, even under a heightened rationality test, there is sufficient evidence that legitimate\npurposes motivated passage as well. Moreover, the evidence of animus submitted by plaintiffs 00 such as fiery\n97\nstatements by members of the Senate like \"criminals ... deserve to be punished.... [T]heir lives should, on the\nwhole be describable by the old concept known as `hard time.'\" Sen. Abraham, 141 Cong.Rec. at S14419 00\n97\nmust, in the words of the First Circuit, \"be taken with a grain of salt00elected officials, after all, have been known to\n97\nstrike poses for public consumption 00 the most that fairly can be said is that oratory of this sort may evince a\n97\nphilosophical shift; it hardly betokens an impermissible animus.\" Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 129 F.3d at 661.\n[19] The contempt motions involve civil, not criminal, contempt sanctions against defendants. This distinction is\nimportant, not only because imposition of criminal, as opposed to civil, sanctions entails different procedural\nsafeguards, but because the scope of the Court's power to order sanctions also differs depending on which type\nof contempt is found by the Court.\n[20]Harris, plaintiff's contend, is inapposite because, although the sanction of dismissing the motion to modify\nwas deemed to be inappropriate, the City in that case continued to remain obliged to produce the documents at\nissue. Here, in contrast, their argument continues, granting defendants' Motion to Terminate, without holding\nthem in contempt, will relieve defendants of all their current obligations. That is true but in this case, unlike in \nHarris, the underlying decree is being invalidated. Thus, the situation in the instant matter is like that in Wheeling\nBridge and, like the Wheeling Bridge Court, this Court will not find defendants in contempt.\n[21] The Court's conclusion that it need not reach the issue of whether or not the defendants violated provisions\nof the Consent Decree or its Amendments moots a number of subsidiary issues, such as whether the body of\nMagistrate Judge Hall's Report and Recommendation was incorporated into the 1983 Amendment to Stipulation\nand the proper interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d) in the context of this case. For the same\nreasons the Court declines to reach the question of whether defendants are in contempt, it will not reach the\nmerits of these subsidiary issues, although it commends the parties on their thorough and able briefing and\nargument on these issues.\n[22] Plaintiff McKennon admitted during a deposition that in her last year of employment, she had copied several\nof her employer's confidential documents. While the Supreme Court held that this evidence did not bar her ADEA\nclaim, it was nonetheless relevant to the question of damages.\n[23] The Court notes that the Second Circuit granted rehearing en banc in Benjamin; the rehearing was held on\nFebruary 25, 1998 and the Second Circuit has not yet issued an opinion.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
