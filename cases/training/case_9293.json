Specifically, the complaint alleged the defendants refused to hire mentally disabled transportation assistants at their hospital and caused those already employed to be terminated.  Following some discovery, the parties settled the lawsuit in October 2007 through a consent decree.The two-year decree, containing an anti-retaliation provision, required the defendant to: make compliance reports, keep records, establish a compliance liaison, allow the EEOC access for monitoring, utilize objective hiring criteria, post notice of employee rights, provide employee training, and pay $122,500 to an unknown number of class members. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2009.",

In early June 2004, Park Plaza's contract liaison Matthew Daniel asked CRI how long \nit would take if CRI had to replace its \"special people.\"  Eva Aguirre, the Director of CRI's Adult \nTraining and Employment Services (the parent ofC.R.I. Commercial) asked Daniel ifhis use of the \nword \"special\" referred to the CRI workers with disabilities.  Daniel responded affirmatively. \nAguirre informed Daniel of her opinion that his implied request for CRI to terminate its disabled \n3 \n\nemployees was illegal and against CRI's mission. \n12.  By letter dated June 28,2004, President and Chief Executive Officer Lex A. Guinn \nadvised C.R.I.  Commercial's Executive Director that Defendant was  cancelling the  Services \nAgreement, and that the cancellation would be effective August 1,2004. Guinn advised in that letter \nof Defendant's decision to \"bring the Transportation Service inhouse and not outsource it to anther \n[sic] entity.\" \n13.  Guinn also indicated that although Defendant was giving 30 days' notice of the \ncontract's cancellation pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Defendant would be \"most agreeable \nand adaptable to\" CRI's removing its contract workers prior to August 1. \n14.  Further, Daniel requested that Aguirre schedule the disabled workers to be off from \nJuly 27-29, 2004, when the Joint Accreditation Committee was expected to audit the hospital. \nDaniel reasoned that the hospital administrator did not want to risk any of the disabled workers \nsaying anything \"wrong\" to an auditor. \n15.  When Defendant later hired the patient transporters \"in-house,\" Defendant hired \nalmost all the non-disabled workers who had been contract workers through C.R.!. Commercial. \nDefendant did not offer jobs to any of the developmentally disabled people who had been contract \nworkers prior to Defendant's cancellation of the Services Agreement. \n16.  Tenet violated the ADA by causing the terminations of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities, including Dana M.  Hays, and by unlawfully interfering with their exercise and \nenjoyment of rights guaranteed by the ADA.  Tenet also violated the ADA by failing to hire \nqualified individuals such as Ms. Hays because of their developmental disabilities. \n17.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 11-16 above were \n4 \n\nintentional. \n18.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 11-16 above were \ndone  with malice  or with reckless  indifference to  the  federally protected rights of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities, including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian \n\"Renee\" Howard, Anne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Tenet, its officers, successors, \nassigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in failing to \naccommodate impaired employees and firing them, and any other employment practice which \ndiscriminates on the basis of disability. \nB.  Order Defendant Tenet to institute and carry out policies, practices, and programs \nwhich provide equal employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities, and which \neradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful employment practices. \nC.  Order Defendant Tenet to make whole the disabled workers it unlawfully caused to \nlose their jobs, including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian \"Renee\" Howard, \nAnne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson, by providing \nappropriate backpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be determined at trial, and other \naffirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of its unlawful employment practices, including \nbut not limited to their reinstatement. \nD.  Order Defendant Tenet to make whole the disabled workers it unlawfully failed to \nhire, including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian \"Renee\" Howard, Anne \n5 \n\nLouise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson, by providing appropriate \nbackpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be determined at trial, and other affirmative relief \nnecessary to eradicate the effects of its unlawful employment practices, including but not limited to \ntheir instatement. \nE.  Order Defendant Tenet to make whole the disabled workers against whom it \nunlawfully discriminated -- including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian \n\"Renee\" Howard, Anne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson- \nby providing compensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful \nemployment practices described in paragraphs 9-16 above, includingjob search expenses and any \nmedical expenses incurred as a result of loss of participation in any employee benefit plan, in \namounts to be determined at trial. \nF.  Order Defendant Tenet to make whole the disabled workers against whom it \nunlawfully discriminated -- including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian \n\"Renee\" Howard, Anne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson- \nby providing compensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful \npractices  complained  of  in  paragraphs  9-16  above,  including  emotional  pain,  suffering, \ninconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial. \nG.  Order Defendant Tenet to pay punitive damages to Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, \nAnnette Hill, Lillian \"Renee\" Howard, Anne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, Kathleen \nLouise Wilson, and any other disabled individuals against whom it unlawfully discriminated for \nTenet's malicious and reckless conduct, as described in paragraphs 11-16 above, in amounts to be \ndetermined at trial. \n6 \n\nH.

At all relevant times, Tenet\nHealthcare has been doing business in the State of Texas and the city of Houston, and has\ncontinuously had at least 15 employees.

At all relevant times, Defendant Tenet Employment has been a covered entity under\nSection 101(2) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2).\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS\n10. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Dana Marie Hayes filed\na charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title I of the ADA by Tenet.  All conditions\n3\n\nprecedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.\n11. Since at least June 2004, Tenet has engaged in unlawful employment practices at Park\nPlaza Hospital in Houston, Texas, in violation of Sections 101 et. seq. of Title I of the ADA, 42\nU.S.C. § 12101 et seq.\n12. Park Plaza Hospital and C.R.I. Commercial Services were parties to a Services\nAgreement contact for C.R.I. Commercial to provide patient transportation services, i.e., “patient\ntransporters” or “patient escorts,” for the hospital.  CRI Commercial was affiliated with the Center\nfor the Retarded, Inc. (“CRI”).  Nearly half of the contract workers who staffed the patient\ntransporter positions had been diagnosed with mental retardation or other developmental disabilities.\n13. Effective June 1, 2004, the contract between C.R.I. Commercial and Park Plaza\nHospital was renewed for an additional term of one year.\n14. In early June 2004, Park Plaza’s contract liaison Matthew Daniel asked CRI how long\nit would take if CRI had to replace its “special people.”  Eva Aguirre, the Director of CRI’s Adult\nTraining and Employment Services (the parent of C.R.I. Commercial) asked Daniel if his use of the\nword “special” referred to the CRI workers with disabilities.  Daniel responded affirmatively.\nAguirre informed Daniel of her opinion that his implied request for CRI to terminate its disabled\nemployees was illegal and against CRI’s mission.       \n15. By letter dated June 28, 2004, President and Chief Executive Officer Lex A. Guinn\nadvised C.R.I. Commercial’s Executive Director that Tenet was canceling the Services Agreement,\nand that the cancellation would be effective August 1, 2004.  Guinn advised in that letter of Tenet’s\ndecision to “bring the Transportation Service inhouse and not outsource it to anther [sic] entity.” \n16. Guinn also indicated that although Tenet was giving 30 days’ notice of the contract’s\n4\n\ncancellation pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tenet would be “most agreeable and adaptable\nto” CRI’s removing its contract workers prior to August 1.  \n17. Further, Daniel requested that Aguirre schedule the disabled workers to be off from\nJuly 27-29, 2004, when the Joint Accreditation Committee was expected to audit the hospital.\nDaniel reasoned that the hospital administrator did not want to risk any of the disabled workers\nsaying anything “wrong” to an auditor.  \n18. When Tenet later hired the patient transporters “in-house,” Tenet hired almost all the\nnon-disabled workers who had been contract workers through C.R.I. Commercial.  Tenet did not\noffer jobs to any of the developmentally disabled people who had been contract workers prior to the\ncancellation of the Services Agreement.   \n19. Since at least July 2004, Tenet has failed, in violation of Section 107(a) of the ADA,\n42 U.S.C. § 12117(a), which incorporates by reference Section 709(c) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-8(c), to make and preserve records relevant to the determination of whether unlawful\nemployment practices have been or are being committed.\n20. Tenet violated the ADA by causing the terminations of qualified individuals with\ndisabilities, including Dana M. Hays, and by unlawfully interfering with their exercise and\nenjoyment of rights guaranteed by the ADA.  Tenet also violated the ADA by failing to hire\nqualified individuals such as Ms. Hays because of their developmental disabilities. \n21. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 11-20 above were\nintentional.\n22. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 11-20 above were\ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of qualified\n5\n\nindividuals with disabilities, including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian\n“Renee” Howard, Anne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:\nA. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Tenet Healthcare and Tenet Employment,\ntheir officers, successors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with them, from\nengaging in failing to accommodate impaired employees and firing them, and any other employment\npractice which discriminates on the basis of disability.\nB.

At all relevant times, Defendant Tenet Employment has been a covered entity under\nSection 101(2) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2).\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS\n10. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Dana Marie Hayes filed\na charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title I of the ADA by Tenet.  All conditions\n3\n\nprecedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.\n11. Since at least June 2004, Tenet has engaged in unlawful employment practices at Park\nPlaza Hospital in Houston, Texas, in violation of Sections 101 et. seq. of Title I of the ADA, 42\nU.S.C. § 12101 et seq.\n12. Park Plaza Hospital and C.R.I. Commercial Services were parties to a Services\nAgreement contact for C.R.I. Commercial to provide patient transportation services, i.e., “patient\ntransporters” or “patient escorts,” for the hospital.  CRI Commercial was affiliated with the Center\nfor the Retarded, Inc. (“CRI”).  Nearly half of the contract workers who staffed the patient\ntransporter positions had been diagnosed with mental retardation or other developmental disabilities.\n13. Effective June 1, 2004, the contract between C.R.I. Commercial and Park Plaza\nHospital was renewed for an additional term of one year.\n14. In early June 2004, Park Plaza’s contract liaison Matthew Daniel asked CRI how long\nit would take if CRI had to replace its “special people.”  Eva Aguirre, the Director of CRI’s Adult\nTraining and Employment Services (the parent of C.R.I. Commercial) asked Daniel if his use of the\nword “special” referred to the CRI workers with disabilities.  Daniel responded affirmatively.\nAguirre informed Daniel of her opinion that his implied request for CRI to terminate its disabled\nemployees was illegal and against CRI’s mission.       \n15. By letter dated June 28, 2004, President and Chief Executive Officer Lex A. Guinn\nadvised C.R.I. Commercial’s Executive Director that Tenet was canceling the Services Agreement,\nand that the cancellation would be effective August 1, 2004.  Guinn advised in that letter of Tenet’s\ndecision to “bring the Transportation Service inhouse and not outsource it to anther [sic] entity.” \n16. Guinn also indicated that although Tenet was giving 30 days’ notice of the contract’s\n4\n\ncancellation pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tenet would be “most agreeable and adaptable\nto” CRI’s removing its contract workers prior to August 1.  \n17. Further, Daniel requested that Aguirre schedule the disabled workers to be off from\nJuly 27-29, 2004, when the Joint Accreditation Committee was expected to audit the hospital.\nDaniel reasoned that the hospital administrator did not want to risk any of the disabled workers\nsaying anything “wrong” to an auditor.  \n18. When Tenet later hired the patient transporters “in-house,” Tenet hired almost all the\nnon-disabled workers who had been contract workers through C.R.I. Commercial.  Tenet did not\noffer jobs to any of the developmentally disabled people who had been contract workers prior to the\ncancellation of the Services Agreement.   \n19. Since at least July 2004, Tenet has failed, in violation of Section 107(a) of the ADA,\n42 U.S.C. § 12117(a), which incorporates by reference Section 709(c) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-8(c), to make and preserve records relevant to the determination of whether unlawful\nemployment practices have been or are being committed.\n20. Tenet violated the ADA by causing the terminations of qualified individuals with\ndisabilities, including Dana M. Hays, and by unlawfully interfering with their exercise and\nenjoyment of rights guaranteed by the ADA.  Tenet also violated the ADA by failing to hire\nqualified individuals such as Ms. Hays because of their developmental disabilities. \n21. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 11-20 above were\nintentional.\n22. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 11-20 above were\ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of qualified\n5\n\nindividuals with disabilities, including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian\n“Renee” Howard, Anne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:\nA. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Tenet Healthcare and Tenet Employment,\ntheir officers, successors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with them, from\nengaging in failing to accommodate impaired employees and firing them, and any other employment\npractice which discriminates on the basis of disability.\nB. Order Tenet to institute and carry out policies, practices, and programs which provide\nequal employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities, and which eradicate the\neffects of their past and present unlawful employment practices.\nC. Order Tenet to make whole the disabled workers it unlawfully caused to lose their\njobs, including Dana Hays, Roderick L.

Order Tenet to make and preserve all records, in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 709(c) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-8(c), relevant to the\ndetermination of whether unlawful employment practices have been or are being committed.\nE. Order Tenet to make whole the disabled workers it unlawfully failed to hire, including\nDana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian “Renee” Howard, Anne Louise Maurer,\n6\n\nMaxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson, by providing appropriate backpay with\nprejudgment interest, in amounts to be determined at trial, and other affirmative relief necessary to\neradicate the effects of its unlawful employment practices, including but not limited to their\ninstatement.\nF. Order Tenet to make whole the disabled workers against whom it unlawfully\ndiscriminated -- including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian “Renee” Howard,\nAnne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson -- by providing\ncompensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment practices\ndescribed in paragraphs 11-18 above, including job search expenses and any medical expenses\nincurred as a result of loss of participation in any employee benefit plan, in amounts to be determined\nat trial. \nG. Order Tenet to make whole the disabled workers against whom it unlawfully\ndiscriminated -- including Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette Hill, Lillian “Renee” Howard,\nAnne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, and Kathleen Louise Wilson -- by providing\ncompensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practices\ncomplained of in paragraphs 12-18 above, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss\nof enjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial.\nH. Order Tenet to pay  punitive damages to Dana Hays, Roderick L. Baines, Annette\nHill, Lillian “Renee” Howard, Anne Louise Maurer, Maxine Marion Wigley, Kathleen Louise\nWilson, and any other disabled individuals against whom it unlawfully discriminated for Tenet’s\nmalicious and reckless conduct, as described in paragraphs 14-18 above, in amounts to be\ndetermined at trial.\n7\n\nI. Grant such further relief as the Court deems necessary and proper in the public\ninterest.\nJ.
