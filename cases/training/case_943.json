    "summary": "<p>On November 21, 1972, inmates of the South Dakota State Penitentiary filed a Section 1983 suit in the District Court for the Southern Division of South Dakota against the warden, prison officials, and the Governor.  Plaintiffs complained of punishment for violations of prison rules without due process of law, prison officials reading and censoring incoming and outgoing mail, poor medical treatment, inadequate religious and cultural protections, inadequate work release and employment programs, and limited access to the law library.  On December 26, 1972, a plaintiff subclass was created consisting of all Native American inmates.  This subclass was represented by the Native American Rights Fund.  </p><p>On December 1, 1972, the District Court (Judge Fred J. Nichol) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction preventing defendants from opening, reading, or interfering with any legally related incoming or outgoing mail.  In a partial consent decree filed on January 29, 1975, the parties agreed to terms on the opening and censorship of incoming and outgoing mail.  Judge Nichol subsequently modified this decree in a July 11, 1986 order which allowed prison officials to withhold mail delivery from a particular inmate suspected of receiving LSD.  </p><p>On August 24, 1973, the District Court issued an order granting the plaintiffs some relief on their due process claims, providing certain procedures that defendants must follow in inmate disciplining.  This order was subsequently amended by orders on the following dates:  November 21, 1973; November 23, 1973; December 6, 1974; March 10, 1975; and June, 1, 1978.  </p><p>On May 22, 1974, a temporary restraining order was filed preventing defendants from taking any disciplinary action against any members of the Native American subclass for violations of a prison haircut rule.  On April 4, 1975, after a hearing on the merits, the District Court held that the hair length regulations - as applied to the members of the Native American subclass - were unconstitutional, and enjoined the defendants from enforcing the hair length regulations against the Native American subclass.  </p><p>On August 21, 1975, the District Court issued an order approving the Living Guide and Regulations of the South Dakota State Penitentiary.  Modifications to the Living Guide were approved in orders dated September 2, 1986 and February 24, 1993.  </p><p>On February 17, 1976, a partial consent decree was filed addressing inmate's cosmetic dental treatment.  </p><p>On May 4, 1977, the parties signed a settlement agreement which, among other things, provided for better medical treatment, religious accommodations for Native American inmates, and access to a law library.  </p><p>This case involves the same plaintiff class and defendants as Native American Council of Tribes v. Solem, 691 F.2d 382 (8th Cir. 1982).  PC-SD-003.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "Crowe v. Erickson\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\nDISTRICT OF SOUTH DAKOTA\nPC-SD-002-001\nSOUTHERN DIVISION\nBERNARD  CROWE,  e t. a l .,\nPlaintiffs, CIV. NO. 72-4101\nvs.\nDON R.  ERICKSON,  et.  al., AGREEMENT IN SETTELMENT\nAND JUDGMENT CONFIRMING\nDefendants. SETTLEMENT\nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit in November, 1972,\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983, et. seq. against the warden, other\nprison officials and the Governor, challenging certain condi-\ntions and practices at the South Dakota State Penitentiary.\nThere are two classes of Plaintiffs sanctioned by Order of thia\nCourt.  The first class represents all present and future in-\nmates of the South Dakota State Penitentiary.  A subclass\nconsists of all present and future. Indian inmates.  By order of\nthis Court, Plaintiffs were permitted to proceed in forma\npauperi3.\nPlaintiffs' original complaint contained several claims\nfor relief.  The complaint was amended and additional relief\nwas requested.  With regard to Plaintiffs' First Claim for Re-\nlief, the Plaintiffs claimed that penitentiary officials read\nand censored all incoming and outgoing mail.  This issue has\nboen resolved by & Partial Consent Decree filed with this Court\nin 1975.  Plaintiffs' Second Claim for Relief alleged that\nPlaintiffs were subjected to punishment for violations of prison\nrules by the Defendants without being afforded the protections\nof due process of law.  This issue was resolved by this Court's\nOrder dated August 23, 1973, as amended by Orders dated November\n21st and 23rd, 1973, and December 6, 1074, which Orders were\nmandated by and are subject to United States Supreme Court deci-\nsions and may be modified by the parties upon application of\nthe Court to conform to said decisions.\n\nSince the date of the filing of this lawsuit, Defend-\nants -have voluntarily changed many prison practices and proced~\nures, thereby eliminating the need for trial on many of the\nissues raised by Plaintiffs.  Those good faith changes are as\nfollows:\n1.  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF  (Medical Issues).  On\nFebruary 11, 1974, the Defendants hired a full-time nurse.  On\nJune 9, 1976, the Defendant* hired a full-time nurse to be pre-\nsent on those days at the penitentiary that a medical doctor\nconducts sick call.  Since approximately February 17, 1976, the\nDefendants ceased charging any inmate for necessary medical\ntreatment.  No inmate is presently being charged for any necess-\nary eye glasses or prosthetic devices unless the same have been\ndeliberately destroyed or broken by the inmate.  No initiate is\npresently performing any medical function which is contrary to\nSouth Dakota law including the drawing of blood, giving of x-rays\nor dispensing of medication.  At those times when a medical dqc-\ntor is not physically present at the penitentiary and there is\nthe need for emergency treatment of an injury, such inmate, if\nthe medical need arises, is seen by a medical doctor at the peni-\ntentiary or is transported to one of the two local Sioux Falls\nhospitals for emergency out-patient care.  At the present time,\nthe Defendants are approaching the State legislature with a re-\nquest for appropriations to improve their medical and psychiatric\ndelivery  system.\n2.  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  (Religious and Cultural\nRehabilitation Programs).  The Defendants have instituted a\nprogram for the religious need3 of Native American  inmates which\ninclude the following:  (a) Four medicine men have been selected\nby the inmates and various Tribal Chairman for the tribes in\nSouth Dakota and approved by the warden to conduct sacred pipe\nceremonies and services on a regular and special basis.  Inmates\nwho desire are permitted and do participate in sacred pipe\nsessions each Saturday morning, and they are and have been'per-\nmitted to participate in special ceremonies at unscheduled\n-2-  •*?•';••;\nf  )\n\ntimes as the spiritual need arises;  (b) The Defendant warden\nhas given approval, which has been confirmed by the Board of\nCharities and Corrections, for the construction of a sweat lodge\nat the penitentiary for religious purposes;  (c) The Defendants\nhave instituted a reevaluation of the: religious programming at\nthe penitentiary to consider the allocation of any sums budgeted\nfor religious activities including Indian religious activities;\n(d) At reasonable intervals, based on the level of imnate accep-\ntance, traditional Indian food may be brought in to the-peni-\ntentiary by recognized outside groups;  (e) Defendants will\ncontinue to allow Indian inmates to wear headbands, medicine\npouches and other recognized Indian artifacts and paraphernalia,\nsubject to legitimate security requirements.  .  •  •• • •-\n3.  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  (Work Release).  The De-\nfendants have agreed to continue tho present policy of providing\nequal access to work release for all inmates.  Included in this\nprogram will be the continuing effort of the State.tp enter into\nvarious forms of programs with other governmental entities, in-\ncluding Indian tribes.\n4.  SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  (Employment).  The Defend-\nants will continue to provide for the rehabilitation need's'of\nall inmates by continuing the following employment actions:\n(a) The program:instituted  in 1968 will continue at the peni-\ntentiary for the training of professional and nonprofessional\nstaff in race relations.  The program is aimed at increasing the\nsensitivity of the penitentiary  staff toward the unique cul-\ntural differences between the various ethnic backgrounds of the\ninmate populations.  Included in the programming  is the uti-\nlization of outside individuals who arc knowledgeable in the\nfield of racial and ethnic problems;  (b) Defendants will con-\ntinue the development of a written minority hiring program aimed\ntoward additional employment of minority personnel at all levels\nof security and rehabilitation.  Defendants recognize that during\nthe past year approximately twenty-five percent of the inmates\n-3-\n\nat the penitentiary have been Indians.  The State will assign\na staff member to direct this minority hiring program.  Neces-\nsary travel to all parts of the State, including India.! reser-\nvations, and announcements of employment availability will be\nan integral part of this plan.\n5.  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Indian Representative\non the Board of Charities and Corrections).  Since an Indian\nwa3 appointed to the Board of Charities and Corrections in\nJanuary, 1973, Plaintiffs' Seventh Claim for Relief vill be dis-\nmissed.  The State agrees that all citizens in this State have\na right to equal consideration for appointment to tha Board and\nthat competent individuals should continue to be appointed..\n6.  EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Law Library).  The De-\nfendants agree to maintain and keep current the existing law\nlibrary, which is described in Exhibit A wh.ich is attached\nhereto and incorporated by reference.  •\nIn light of the above voluntary changes initiated by\nthe Defendants and their good faith recognition that any program\nfor rehabilitation involves the understanding of the race1and\nculture of the inmate population in order for relevant programs\nfor these prisoners to be developed, the parties now believe '\nthey are in a position to enter into an AGREEMENT IN SETTLEMENT\nAND JUDGMENT CONFIRMING SETTLEMENT, wherein the Defendants,\ntheir successors, agents and employees agree in good faith to\ndo the following:\n1.  With regard to total satisfaction of Plaintiffs'\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF, it is agreed that:\n(a)  Inmates requiring eye glasses will be\nprovided an eye examination and glasses at\nState expense whenever a proscription or\nprescription change is deemed necessary by\nthe eye doctor.  Replacement or repair coata\nof issue glasses broken in conjunction\nwith State activities will bo borne by the\n-4-\n\nState. ...In the event that an inmate wilfully\ndestroys eye glasses or other prosthetic\ndevices supplied by the State, new glasses\nor devices will be provided at the inmate's\nexpense.\n(b)  The Defendants will not charge inmates\nfor the cost of any medically necessary\ntreatment or prosthetic devices.\n(c)  Prisoners or staff will not be per-\nmitted to perform any medical or medically\nrelated duties vhich under State law they\nare not authorised to perform.  The De-\nfendants shall request a legal opinion\nfrom the Attorney General specifying those\nmedical duties which may bi: lawfully per-\nformed by nonlicenscd persons.\n(d)  Defendants will continue the present\npolicy of not permitting inmates to view\nmedical records of other inmates.\n(e)  The Defendants agree to maintain\ntheir current levol of professional medical\ncare staffing.  In addition, Defendants\nagree to make a good faith effort to sub-\nmit a bill to the State legislature to\nacquire sufficient appropriations necessary\nto hire the following medical care staff:\n1.  One licensed physician's assistant\non a full-time basis to bo present,\nworking under the doctor's super-\nvision at the institution, whose\nfull-time schedule shall include\nworking evenings and weekends;\n2.  One licensed clinical psychologist\non a full-time basis to develop,\n-5-\n\nimplement and coordinate a psych-\niatric treatment program;\n3.  One psychiatrist to work as needed\nto assist the above mentioned clin-\nical psychologist in said psychiatric\ntreatment program.  Such assistance\nis not to exceed one-half-day per\nweek.\nIn the event that the Defendants fail in their\ngood faith effort to obtain funds sufficient\nto obtain the personnel mentioned in para-\ngraph (e) 1. through 3., above by ftpril 15,\n1977, the Plaintiffs may apply to the Court\nfor relief without resorting to the adminis-\ntrative remedy referred to at page 11\ninfra.  (This paragraph is not an admission\nthat the foregoing personnel are Constitution-\nally required.)-\n(f)  The Defendants agree to maintain a\nmedical department at the penitentiary\npursuant to a written set of procedures and\nprotocols which provide for:  h. procedure\nto be followed for inmates desiring access\nto medical personnel, medical job descrip-\ntions, medical record keeping, relation-\nships with the security department, in-\nstructions as to what guidelines to follow\nat times when no medical personnel are\npresent at the institution and assurances\nthat at no time will security override\nmedical orders.\n(g)  The Defendants agree to continue their\npresent policy against the indiscriminate  ;\n^Nothing herein shall preclude inmates from obtain-\ning outside psychiatric treatment from other sources at their\nown expense.\n-6-\n\ncrushiny of medication of prisoners except\nwith regard to those prisoners who have\nbeen found by the disciplinary board to\nbe hoarding medication.\n(h)  The Defendants agree to continue their\npolicy of the checking of inmates in the\nadjustment center tiurint, each 3ick call by\na qualified medical staff member,\n(i)  The Defendants agree to provide each\nprisoner with a routine medical checkup\nevery three years.\n2.  With regard to total satisfaction of Plaintiffs'\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF it is agreed that:\n(a)  The State of South Dakota agrees that\nIndian religious services will continue\nto be placed on a level comparable to\nother religious services and will provide\nand continue to extend official recognition\nto Indian religious activities.\n(b)  The State will continue to provide\nroutine Indian religious ceremonies, in-\neluding a sweat lodge, pipe ceremonies\nand medicine men ceremonion.\n(c)  The State will set aside an amount\nof money to pay for Indian religious\nservices and activities, which will be\ncomparable by inmate religious preference\nto the amount currently expended for\nCatholic or Protestant religious services\nand activities at the South Dakota State\nPenitentiary.  This agreement does not\nobligate the Defendants to fund wholly or\nin part, any religious services and activ-\nities should their budget for all religious\nactivities be cut by the Board of Charities\nand Corrections.\n-7-\n\n(d)  The State will continue; to offer a\nvariety of educational courses for the\npersonal advancement o*. the inmate popu-\nlation.  Included in cuch curriculum will\nbe courses relating to subjects dealing\nwith Indian history and culture.  Defend-\nants will look to recognized academic\ninstitutions and government agencies,\nincluding recognized Indian resource edu-\ncation groups, as resources for assisting\nthem in setting up Indian study courses,\n(e)  The State of South Dakota will cause\nall standardized intelligence, intelli-\ngence quotient or psychological tests\ncurrently utilized in tho South Dakota\nState Penitentiary, for any prupose,'to\nbe validated for cultural or racial bias\nagainst all inmates and to replace or\nchange those tests found to bo invalid.\nIf any of said tests are found to be in-\nvalid and thus replaced by new tests,\nminority inmates will be rotcsted and\nthe previous invalid tests or test results\nwill be removed from thoir records.—'\n(f)  At reasonable intervals, based.on\nthe level of inmate acceptance, tradi-\ntional Indian food may be brought in to\nthe pententiary by recogni/.od outside\ngroups.\n(g)  The State, in order to allow Indian\ninmates to express their culture and\npractice their religion, will continue to\nallow Indian inmates, to wear headbands,\n— The medical personnel contemplated under paragrap\n(e), page 5, supra, will give; proper consideration to explori\nthe validity of standardized psychiatric tests used in evalue\nthe mental profile? of minority persons.\n\nmedicine pouches and other recognized\nIndian artifacts and par .pherrm lia, subject\nto legitimate security requirements,\n(h)  The Defendants agree to supplement\nthe social portion of their rehabilitation\nprogram by establishing Indian Brotherhood\nmeetings on a basis attendant to the\nlevel of inmate and community partici-\npation.  The Indian Brotherhood meetings\nshall be open to all interested inmates\nfrom the general inmate population.  The\npurposes of the Indian Brotherhood\nmeetings shall include:\n1.  To provide a social ;.>ro\"ir<->m relevant\n... to Indian culture;\n2.  To coordinate its activities with\nIndian religious activities and\nother activities currently offered\nby the Defendants; and\n3.  To augment the existing alcoholism\ncounseling program by coordinating\nmutually supportive activities.-'\nThe Indian Brotherhood meetings shall be\nsupervised or sponsored by one of the\n— Based on expert consultation the Defendants acknow- •\nledge that alcoholism problems of Indians may be more effectively\ntreated by establishing an environment which may foster spiritual\nand cultural pride in conjunction with an alcpholism1 treatment\nprogram.  Thus, while both the parties stipulate that the present\nalcoholism program is functioning satisfactorily, they'agree\nthat such program may be improved by cultural augmentation,\nand, to that end, and for purposes of the above paragraph, the\nDefendants agree to do the following:  .\nA.  To obtain culturally relevant alcoholism treat-\nment materials such as, posters, pamphlets and audio-visual\nmaterials from the American Indian Commission, on Alcoholism\nand Drug Abuse;\nB.  To coordinate those social activities of the\nIndian Brotherhood meetings which relate to alcoholism, with\nthe existing alcoholism counseling program.\n-9-\n\nDefentants' staff members, diul, shall\n~~ function pursuant to a written charter,\nby-laws or statement of activities which\nshall be approved by the warden.\n3.  In satisfaction of Plaintiffs' FIFTH CLAIM FOR\nRELIEF the State agrees to continue the present policy of pro-\nviding equal access,placement on and release to work release\nfor all inmates.  Included in this program will be the continu-\ning effort of the State to enter into various forms of programs\nwith other governmental entities, including Indian tribes.\nBefore any agreement is entered into with the Indian\ntribes, the extradition of penitentiary inmates from the Indian\nreservation must be provided fpr with the appropriate tribal\ngovernment.  In addition. State work release officers must be\nguaranteed full and complete access to inmates/who have- been\ntransferred to an Indian reservation.\n4.  In satisfaction of Plaintiffs' SIXTH CLAIM FOR\nRELIEF the State will continue to do the following:\n(a)  The State will continue to maintain\na program to sensitize, train and sub-\nsequently evaluate prison employees\nconcerning the'unique culture of Native\nAmerican prisoners.  Staff relations with\nNative American prisoners will have an\nemphasis in this program.  Defendants\nagree that the purpose of Lho training\nprogram for prison staff will be to sen-\nsitize them to the rehabilitative need\nto encourage all inmates, including Native\nAmerican prisoners, to be '>roud of their\nunique culture and race.\n(b)  Defendants will continue the develop-\nment of a written minority hiring program\naimed toward additional employment of\nminorities at all levels Of security and\n-10-\n\nrehabilitation.  Defendant;; recognize\n—  that during the past year .ipproximately\ntwenty-five percent of the inmates at\nthe penitentiary have boon Indiana.  The\nState will assign a staff member to direct\nthis minority hiring program.  Necessary\ntravel to all parts of the State, in-\ncluding Indian reservations, and\nannouncements of employment availability\nwill be an integral part of this plan.\n5.  Since an Indian has been appointed to the Board\nof Charities and Corrections for over a year, Plaintiffs'\nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF will'be dismissed.  The State agrees\nthat all citizens in this State have a right to equal con-\nsideration for appointment to the uoard nnd that competent\nindividuals should continue to be appointed.\n6.  In regard to total satisfaction of Plaintiffs'\nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF the Defendants agree to maintain and\nkeep current the existing law library, as listed in Exhibit A.\nThe state will provide periodic workshops to train selected in-\nmates in the fundamentals of legal research.\nThe parties agree that the provisions contained in\nthis document constitute the minimum responsibility required\nunder law; and Plaintiffs hereby waive their right to resort\nto the Court to redress alleged violations of said provisions\nwithout first exhausting the administrative remedy of meeting\nformally and in good faith with the Defendants at the peni-\ntentiary to discuss any implementation or compliance problems\nwhich they may believe to exist.  For purposes of this AGREE-\nMENT IN SETTLEMENT AND JUDGMENT COW 1KMING SETTLEMENT, the\nadministrative remedy is defined as a meeting'at the prison\nwith the warden or his designee, the complaining inmate and\nhis counsel, to be scheduled on no loss than five (5) working\ndays prior written notice.  In the event that such meeting\n-11-\n\ncannot be scheduled within ton (10) working days from the date\npf said written notice, Plaintiffs will ba deemed to have com-\nplied with the administrative remedy.  All such meetings, if\nany, shall be conducted in good faith hy all parties.

The  petitioner \ncomplains  that he  is being  segregated without benefit  of the \nprocedural protections mandated by .Yudge  Nichol's August  24, \n1974  Order. \nThe  petitioner has  requested  that David  vrooman,  United \nStates Magistrate,  be  appointed  to investigate  and  formally \n\nCase 4:72-cv-04101     Document 94     Filed 08/10/2002     Page 2 of 3(cid:10)\nreport  upon  the matter  to this Court:.  This  appears  to this \nCOurt  to be  very  reasonable.  This Court  is therefore appoint \nint Mr.  Vrooman  to conduct  an  investigation  into  the matter \npursuant  to  28  U.S.C.A.  §636(b).  Vroananwill  then make \nMx~. \na  formal  report  and  recommendation  t:o  this Court.  The  report \nwill contain the  following. \n(a)  Any  disputes  of fact  relating  to Mr.  Pickering's \nand petition. \ncompl~int \n(b)  Findings  of  fact by Mr.  V%~OO1lIan. \n(c)  Recommendations by Mr.  Vrcjoman,  including whether \nhe believes a  hearing will. be necessary. \nBoth parties to this  action shall hzeve  ten days  from  the \nreceipt  of a  copy  of Mr.  Vrooman' S  l\"eport  to file exceptions \nthereto.  Should  an  issue of  fact  ax\"iae  or  in another appro \npriate circumstance,  this court will. hold  an  evidentiary \nhearing.  This court believes  that this procedure  complies with \nthe  dictates as  set forth  in Noor l;Y;L9!r  v.
