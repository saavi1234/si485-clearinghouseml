Plaintiffs alleged that conditions of confinement violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The complaint also alleged that confinement and transfer procedures violated their Fifth Amendment rights as well as the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection provisions.  </p><p>On June 2, 1980, the plaintiff class was expanded to included all inmates subjected to disciplinary confinement, and a subclass was formed consisting of all Native American inmates.  On June 3, 1980, the case went to trial.</p><p>On April 13, 1982, the court filed an unpublished memorandum decision and order finding no constitutional violations, but ordering that the defendant provide such things as lighting, bedding, daily trash collection, periodic pest control, better access to the law library, and limits on the duration of confinements in dark cells.  The court also recommended such things as a reevaluation of the shower policy, increased recreational opportunities, and  psychiatric care when needed.  </p><p>A final judgment was entered on February 18, 1983 reflecting post-trial changes that were made in response to the memorandum decision and order.  </p><p>Plaintiffs filed for attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988.  On February 7, 1984, the District Court (Judge Fred J. Nichol) awarded the plaintiffs $15,227.78 for attorney fees and costs.  Wabasha v. Solem, 580 F.Supp. 448 (D.S.D. 1984).  According to the docket, the plaintiffs moved to reconsider the amount of attorney fees, but the motion was dismissed on May 4, 1984.</p><p>On August 1, 1989, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an order to show cause why the defendant should not be held in civil contempt.  The motion was denied on August 14, 1991 and the proceedings were dismissed as abandoned.  The docket ends with the entry of the order denying the plaintiffs' motion to hold defendants in contempt on August 15, 1991.  </p><p></p>",

Clayton \nmec  Clerk \nElroy Wabasha,  et a1.,  J \n~  CIV79-4064 \n~  (~/(.f \nPlaintiffs \nvs.  )  MEMORANDUM  DECISION  AND  ORDER \nl \nHerman  Solem,  Warden,  South  Dakota \nState  Penitentiary. \n~ \nDefendant \nThe  plaintiffs,  inmates  at the  South  Dakota  State  Penitentiary, \ncommenced  a  class  action challenging  the  constitutionality  of  certain \npractices of the  defendant  warden  in the  operation of that portion  of \nthe  South  Dakota  State  Penitentiary known  as  the  Adjustment  Center.  The \nplaintiffs are  seeking  declaratory and  injunctive  relief pursuant  to 42 \nU.S.C.  sections  1983,  1985.  and  1986. \nThe  following  issues  were  presented at trial for  resolution  by  the \nCourt: \n1.  \\Vhether  the  action is properly  maintained  as  a  class action \npursuant  to  Rule  23(a)  of the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure \n2.  Whether  conditions  of  confinement  in the  Adjustment  Center \nof the  South  Dakota  state  Penitentiary constitute  cruel and \nunusual  punishment  in  violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment. \n3.  Whether  the  disciplinary  and  classifications procedures  of \nthe  South  Dakota  State  Penitentiary used  to  place  and  keep \ninmates  in the  Adjustment  Center violate  the  due  process \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 2 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nCLASS  CERTIFICATION \nOn  June  2,  1980,  the  Court  certified the  class  pursuant  to  Rule  23 \nof the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  to  include  all  prisoners  who  have \nor will  be  confined  in the  Adjustment  Center  of  the  South Dakota  State \nPenitentiary  and  a  subclass  of all Native  American  inmates  who  have  or \nwill  be  confined  in  the  Adjustment  Center.  The  Court,  however,  reserved \nruling  on  whether  the  named  plaintiffs fairly and  adequately  protect the \ninterests of the  class. \nThe  plaintiffs claim  that  the  conditions  and  procedures  relating \nto  confinement  in the  Adjustment  Center violate  the  Eighth  and  Four \nteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  Further,  they \ncontend that  penitentiary officials discriminate  against  Native  American \ninmates  on  the  basis  of  race  in that Native  American  inmates  are  sent  to \nthe  Adjustment  Center more  often and  for  longer periods  of time  than \nnon-Indian  inmates. \nCivil  rights  actions  challenging  prison conditions  are  tradi \ntionally brought as  class  action  suits.  See  Finney  v.  Hutto,  410 \nF.Supp.  251  (1976),  affirmed  548  F.2d  740  (8th  Cir.  1977),  437  U.S.  678, \n57  L.Ed.2d  522,  98  S.ct.  2565  (1978);  Battle  v.  Anderson,  564  F.2d  388 \n(lOth  Cir.  1977);  Jones  v.  Diamond,  519  F.2d  1090  (5th  Cir.  1975); \nMcCray  v.  Bennett,  467  F.Supp.  187  (1978);  Hardwick  v.  Ault,  447 \nF.Supp.  116  (M.D.Ga.  1978). \nThe  total number  of  inmates  at the  South  Dakota  State Penitentiary \nis approximately  six hundred.  The  average  total number  of Native \nl \nAmerican  inmates  is approximately  twenty-five  percent. Approximately \neighty-five  percent  of the  inmates  in the  general  population never  see \nthe  Adjustment  Center.  Of  the  small  percentage  of  inmates  who  are \nsentenced  to  the  Adjustment  Center,  the  majority  are  there  for a \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 3 of 37, (cid:10).\". :-.- lJi'-.,!:¥it::Jf\\:':'  . :.\"h,,~#t.,,_~,-\n•  •  \".'  -\nrelatively  short period  of time  as  single  offenders.  The  plaintiffs, \nDale  Clark  and  Elroy  Kabasha.  have  been  charged with  numerous  infractions \nof the  prison  rules  and  consequently have  been  sentenced  on  numerous \noccasions  to  the  Adjustment  Center.  As  multiple offenders  of the  prison \nrules both plaintiffs have  also  been  classified as  major disciplinary \nproblems  and  have  at times  been  confined  to  Close  Custody  II.  Richard \nRist,  the  Associate  Warden  (Custody),  testified that  only  twelve  or \nthirteen  inmates,  including  Wabasha  and  Clark,  had  ever been  classified \nadministratively to  Close  Custody  II.  The  defendant  argues  that  the \nnamed  plaintiffs,  because  of  their unique  status  in the  general prison \npopulation and  the  Adjustment  Center population,  are  not  representative \nof  the  total population  and  therefore  cannot  adequately  protect  the \ninterests  of the  class.  The  Court  does  not  agree. \nThis  action  challenges  the  procedures  employed  by  prison  officials \nto  confine  inmates  to  the  Adjustment  Center  and  the  conditions  of con \nfinement  in the  Adjustment  Center.  Admittedly  the  named  plaintiffs  have \nspent a  good  share  of their prison  time  in  the  Adjustment  Center,  but  the \nprocedures  followed  by  the  Disciplinary Board  and  the  Classification \nBoard  are  equally  applicable  to every  inmate.  Once  an  inmate  is \nsentenced  to  the  Adjustment  Center  the  conditions  of confinement  are  the \nsame  for  all  inmates  within  the  Adjustment  Center.  The  questions  of law \nraised  by  the  plaintiffs  in this  case  are  applicable  to  all inmates \nequally.  The  claims  of  the  representatives  of  the  class,  Dale  Clark  and \nElroy Wabasha,  are  based  on  their constitutional rights  and  those  claims \nare  typical  of the  claims  that any  individual  member  of the  class  would \nhave  if he  were  to  pursue  these  issues.  The  Court  is  not  interested  in \nlitigating the  numerous  individual  complaints  that would  inevitably \nresult  if this  action did  not  proceed  as  a  class  action. \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 4 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nrespect  to  any  such actions  by  the  defendant  should  rise  to  the  benefit \nof all inmates  and  not  simply  the  named  plaintiffs.  Finally,  prosecu \ntion  of  separate  actions  by  individual  inmates  would  create  the  risk of \ninconsistent and  varying  adjudications  with respect  to  individual \nmembers  of the  class.  The  purpose  of  this action  is to  insure  all \ninmates  that  their constitutional rights  are  protected  and  that uniform \nand  consistent procedures  are  employed  and  followed. \nAlthough  the  plaintiffs,  Clark  and  Wabasha,  may  not  be  the  most \ntypical people within  the  class  or  subclass,  the  Court  finds  that the \nquestions  of  law  common  to  the  members  of the  class  predominate  over \nany  questions  affecting  only  individual members,  that  the  rights  of all \nmembers  of the  class will be  protected,  and  that  a  class action is \nsuperior to  other available  methods  for  the  fair and  e.fficient  adjudi \ncation  of the  controversy.  In  conclusion,  the  Court  holds  that  this \naction  is properly maintained  as  a  class action under  Rule  23(s)  and \n(b)  of the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. \nCONDITIONS  OF  CONFINEMENT  IN  THE  ADJUSTMENT  CENTER \nFacts \nThere  is one  state penitentiary  in South Dakota.  The  original \nbuilding was  constructed in 1881.  In  approximately 1967  the  Adjustment \nCenter was  built within the walls  of  the  penitentiary.  The  Adjustment \nCenter  is a  two-story  building  which  is physically  separated from  the \nbuildings  housing  the  general  cell blocks.  The  Adjustment  Center  is \ndeSigned  to  serve  as  a  maximum  security unit,  a  prison within a  prison, \nand  is colloquially referred  to  as  the  \"hole\",  The  purpose  of  the \nAdjustment  Center  is  to  house  those  inmates  who  have  committed  serious \nrule  infractions  or who  are  administratively  segregated  from  the \ngeneral  population  because  they  pose  a  threat  to  themselves,  other \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 5 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nSegregation is the  most  restrictive level  of confinement  at the \npenitentiary.  Segregation  is only  used  to  house  inmates  who,  while \nhoused  in  other sections  of the  Adjustment  Center,  continue  to  violate \nprison  rules  and  regulations.  (Exhibit 7,  Policy Statement  #3.26). \nSegregation  is considered  reclassification within  the  Adjustment  Center, \nand  consequently  an  inmate  may  be  placed  in Segregation at the discre \ntion of the  prison officials,  without  a  due  process  hearing.  The  minimum \nstay  in Segregation  is five  days,  and  the  maximum  stay  is thirty days. \nAn  inmate,  however,  may  secure  an  early release from  Segregation by \nsending  a  written statement  (kite)  to  the  Associate  Warden  - Custody, \nindicating  that he  desires  to be  released  and  that he  will  comply  with \nthe  rules and  regulations  of the  institution. \nThere  are  nine  cells  in the  Segregation Unit,  two  of which  are \nrestraint cells or  \"dark  cells\".  The  dark  cells contain only  a  commode, \nand  a  diagonal  bar  that may  be  used  to  restrain an  inmate  who  is \nattempting  self-mutilation.  There  is  an  unwritten  policy that an  inmate \nis not  to  remain  in a  dark  cell for  more  than  twenty-four hours. \nAn  inmate  in Segregation  is provided with  two  blankets,  a  hand \ntowel,  a  bar of soap,  a  partial roll of toilet paper,  a  pair of  cover \nalls,  a  handkerchief,  and  a  pair of  socks.  The  inmate  also  receives  his \ntoothbrush  and  stamped  envelopes  and  stationery  if he  has  them.  Inmates \nin Segregation  receive first class  mail,  attorney visits,  one  shower \nper week,  and  no  recreation. \nThird  Grade  is housed  in the  lower East  cell block  in the  Adjust \nment  Center.  There  are  nine  cells  in Third  Grade.  An  inmate  spends  the \nfirst five  days  of  punishment  for  a  serious  rules  infraction in the \nThird  Grade.  Privileges  in Third  Grade  are  restricted,  but  in addition \nto  the  privileges  afforded  to  the  inmate  in Segregation,  the  inmate  in \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 6 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nDisciplinary Board.  In  addition  to  the  privileges  afforded  the  inmate \nin Third  Grade,  the  inmate  in Second  Grade  is allowed  a  mattress,  two \n2\nsheets,  a  pillow and  pillowcase,  commissary  privileges,  Class  II visits , \nfour  law  library books  per week,  and  fifteen minutes  of  recreation per \nday  in the  corridor  of the  cell block. \nThe  maximum  stay  in the  Adjustment  Center  for  anyone  Disciplinary \nBoard  conviction may  not  exceed  ninety  days.  (Exhibit  7,  Policy Statemerr \n#3.36).  An  inmate  who  commits  an  additional  infraction while  in Second \nor Third  Grade  may  be  administratively transferred  to  Segregation without \na  due  process  hearing.  The  only wayan  inmate  will  serve  more  than  the \noriginal ninety days,  however,  is  if he  is charged with a  new  infraction, \nin which  case  he  must  receive  a  due  process  hearing  before  the  Disci \nplinary Board.  The  Board  may  order  the  second  sentence  to  run  either \nconsecutively  or concurrently. \nAn  inmate  is transferred  from  the  general  population  to  either \nSecond  or Third Grade  in anyone of the  five  following  ways.  (1)  The \ninmate  is convicted  of a  major  rule  infraction and  sentenced to  the \nAdjustment  Center  by  the  Disciplinary  Board.  (2)  An  inmate  who  commits \na  major  or minor  rule  infraction while  serving a  conditional  suspended \nsentence  may  be  sent to  the  Adjustment  Center  to  serve  out  the  earlier \nsentence.  (3)  An  inmate  may  be  detained  in the  Adjustment  Center \npending  investigation of a  serious major rule  infraction.  (4)  An  inmate \nmay  be  detained  on  a  detention order  pending  the  Disciplinary Board \nhearing.  In such  cases  the  detention order must  be  reviewed  every \ntwenty-four hours.  (5)  An  inmate  may  request  to  be  housed  in the \nAdjustment  Center. \nThe  Close  Custody  Unit  (CCU)  is also  housed  in the  Adjustment \nCenter.  Close  Custody  II  is a  nonpunitive  administrative  classification \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 7 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nand  is the  maximum  security section of the  institution.  Close  Custody \nis designed  to  provide  \"more  secure  housing  and  control  of  those  few \ninmates  who  have  not  responded  to  counselling  or conventional disci \nplinary  sanctions and  who  are  flagrantly  or chronically disruptive  of \ngood  order and  security.\"  (Exhibit  7,  Policy statement  #2.28).  Place \nment  in CCU  is determined  by  the  Classification Board,  following  a \nformal  due  process  hearing.)  Criteria for  placement  in CCU  include: \na.  Presentence  or background  investigations  indicating an \nunstable  personality  and/or  aggressive  nature. \nb.  A chronic  inability to  adjust to  the  general  penitentiary \npopulation. \nc.  The  inmate  constitutes a  serious  or continuing  threat \nto  the  security of the  institution or to  staff members \nor to  other  inmates. \n(Exhibit 7,  Policy statement  #2.28). \nIn addition  to  the  privileges allowed  in Third  Grade,  inmates \nin  Close  Custody  II  are  allowed  to  have  personal  items,  such as  TV, \nradiO,  tape  player,  headset,  and  approved  hobby  work  in their cells. \nThey  receive  thirty minutes  of  recreation a  day,  Class  II visits, \ncommissary,  four  law  library  books  a  week,  and  two  showers  a  week. \nEach  cell in the  Adjustment  Center  is  approximately  six feet  by \nten feet  and  contains,  at a  minimum,  a  sink with  running  hot  and  cold \nwater,  a  commode,  a  metal  cot,  and  a  low  density  light which  is \ncontrolled by  the  guards.  There  is only  one  inmate  per cell.  Each \ninmate  is confined  to his  cell at least twenty-three  and  a  half hours \nper day.  Recreation,  when  permitted,  consists  of  no  more  than  one  half \nhour  per  day.  During  recreation,  the  inmate  may  walk  around  the  common \narea  in front  of the  cells,  or take  a  shower.  All  inmates  in the \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 8 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nAdjustment  Center eat commercially  prepared  frozen  t.v.  dinners,  which \nare  supplemented with  fresh  fruit,  bread,  juice.  milk,  and  coffee.  The \nt.v.  dinners  are  prepared  in an  oven  in  the  Adjustment  Center. \nAnalysis \nThe  Court  will first analyze  generally the  Eighth Amendment \nclaims  raised  by  the  plaintiffs.  The  Court  will then  briefly discuss \neach  of the  subissues  raised  relating  to  specific conditions  in the \nAdjustment  Center. \nFirst,  the  Court  recognizes  that it is not  the  role  of the \nfederal  judiciary to  supervise  the  operation  of  state prisons. \nMeachum  v.  Fano,  427  U.S.  215,  229.  96  S.ct.  2532,  49  L.Ed.2d 451 \n(1976).  Reasonable  deference  must  be  afforded  to  the  state authorities \nresponsible  for maintaining  internal order,  discipline  and  security \nwithin  our  state  institutions.  Procunier v.  Martinez,  416  U.S.  396, \n405.  94  S.ct.  1800,  40  L.Ed.2d  224  (1974);  Bell v.  Wolfish,  441  U.S. \n520,  99  S.ct.  1861,  60  L.Ed.2d  447  (1979).  When  prison  policies, \npractices,  or conditions,  however,  offend  a  fundamental  constitutional \nguarantee,  the  federal  courts must  assume  responsibility  for  insuring \nthat  inmates'  constitutional  rights  are  protected.  Procunier v. \nMartinez,  supra  at 405-06. \nIn  examining  the  conditions  in the  Adjustment Center,  this \nCourt's  inquiry  is limited  to determining whether  the  policies, \npractices,  and  conditions  in the  Adjustment  Center  result  in a  depri \nvation  of the  inmates'  constitutional rights.  This  Court  cannot,  and \nwill not,  substitute  its  judgment  for  that  of prison authorities  to \n8S \nwhat  constitutes  the  most  desirable conditions  in  the  Adjustment  Center \nor  in  the  penitentiary as  a  whole. \nThe  plaintiffs allege  that  the  conditions  of confinement  in the \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 9 of 37(cid:10)\n-\n~ \n98  S.ct.  2565,  57  L.Ed.2d  522  (1978);  Bono  v.  Saxbe,  620  F.2d  609  (7th \nCir.  1980);  Burns  v.  Swenson,  430  F.2d  771  (8th Cir.  1970).  The  duration \nof  confinement  and  the  conditions  of  such  confinement,  however,  may \nrender punitive  segregation unconstitutional.  Hutto  v.  Finney,  supra \nat 685-86.  The  Supreme  Court  has  summarized  the  Eighth  Amendment  standar! \nto  be  applied  in  prison  condition cases  as  follows: \nThe  Eighth Amendment's  ban  on  inflicting cruel  and  unusual \npunishments,  made  applicable  to  the  States  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment,  \"proscribe(s)  more  than physically barbarous \npunishments.\"  Estelle v.  Gamble,  429  U.S.  97,  102.  It \nprohibits  penalties  that  are  grossly disproportionate  to  the \noffense,  'Ileems  v.  United  States,  217  U.S.  349,  367,  as well \nas  those  that  transgress  today's  \"broad  and  idealistic \nconcepts  of dignity,  civilized  standards,  humanity  and \ndecency.\"  Estelle v.  Gamble,  429  U.S.  97,  102,  quoting \nJackson v.  Bishop,  404  F.2d  571,  579  (8th Cir.  1968). \nHutto  v.  Finney,  supra  at 685. \nThe  Court  must  consider  the  totality of the  circumstances  as  they \nexist in the  Adjustment  Center  and  then determine  whether  the  conditions \nas  a  whole  are  intolerable,  or  shocking  to  the  conscience,  or totally \nunreasonable  in light of the  \"evolving  standards  of decency  that mark \nthe  progress  of a  maturing  society.\"  Trop  v.  Dulles,  356  U.S.  86,  101, \n78  S.ct.  590,  2  L.Ed.2d  630  (1957);  Burks  v.  Walsh,  461  F.Supp.  454, \n481  (W.D.  Mo.  1978).  Although  the  voluminous  case  law  in the  area  of \nprison  conditions  provides  the  Court  with  some  guidance,  the  holdings \nin  these  cases  are  as  varied as  the  conditions  and  factual  settings \ngiving  rise  to  each  individual  litigation.  Many  of the  courts  finding \nEighth Amendment  violations were  shocked  first and  foremost  by  the \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 10 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nbased  on  the  overcrowded  conditions,  that  the  court  found  other condi \ntions,  such  as  lack  of out  of cell time,  to  be  intolerable.  Overcrowded \nconditions do  not  exist  in the  Adjustment  Center.  Each  inmate  has  an \nindividual  cell,  which  provides  privacy and  adequate  space.  The  Court \ndoes  not  find  the  conditions  existing  in the  Adjustment  Center, \nconsidered  in toto,  intolerable  or  shocking  to  the  conscience.  There \nare,  however,  individual  conditions  that the  defendant  would  be  well \nadvised  to  consider  changing  or modifying,  and  some  that must  be  changed. \nThe  plaintiffs rely  on  Finney  v.  Hutto,  410  F.Supp.  251  (E.D. \nArk.  1976),  affirmed 548  F.2d  740  (8th Cir.  1977),  437  U.S.  678,  98 \nS.ct.  2565,  57  L.Ed.2d  522  (1978),  to  establish their claim  of consti \ntutional violations.  Although  there  are  some  problems  existing  in the \nAdjustment  Center  section of the South Dakota  penitentiary,  they  are  not \neven  close  to  the  conditions  that  existed  in the  Arkansas  prison  system. \nThe  Court  finds  that.  taken  as  a  whole,  the  conditions  at the  South \nDakota  penitentiary more  closely resemble  the  restrictive  conditions \nheld  to be  constitutional  in  Bono  v.  Saxbe,  620  F.2d 609  (7th  Cir.  1980). \nConditions  in the  Adjustment  Center at  the  South  Dakota  peniten \ntiary do  not  begin to  mirror  the  shocking  conditions  which  lead  the  court \nto  find  Eighth Amendment  violations  in Hutto  v.  Finney,  supra,  and  Gates \nv.  Collier,  501  F.2d  1291  (5th  Cir.  1974).  The  conditions  challenged  in \nHutto  included  confining  at  least four  prisoners  in  a  cell measuring \neight  feet  by  ten feet.  There  was  no  furniture  in the  cells;  however, \ninmates  did  receive  insect  and  infection laden  mattresses  at night. \nPrecautions  were  not  taken  to prevent  the  spread  of  infectious  diseases. \nFurther,  inmates  were  fed  \"grue\",  a  mashed  mixture  of  meat,  potatoes, \nand  vegetables.  The  \"grue\"  had  little nutritional value  and  provided \nless  than 1,000 calories  per day.  The  court's concern  in Hutto  was  that \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 11 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nfailed  to  heed  the warnings  of the  court  that  the  court was  forced  to \norder the  changes  made.  This  Court's  experience with  the  named  defen \ndant  is  in no  way  typified by  that described  in Arkansas.  For  example, \nduring  the  trial and  based  on  Hutto,  the  defendant  amended  Department \nPolicy #3.26  to provide  that an  inmate  could not  be  held  in Segregation \nfor more  than  thirty days.  Unlike  the  Arkansas  prison  system,  the  defen \ndant  appears  to  be  working  hard  to  protect the  constitutional  rights  of \ninmates  in the South Dakota  penitentiary,  while maintaining  internal \norder,  discipline  and  institutional security.  Conditions  also differ \nfrom  those  held  to  be  constitutional  in Collier,  where  housing  units \nwere  declared  unfit  for  human  habitation due  to  the  serious  sewer  prob \nlems  causing  contamination  of  the water  supply,  the  uncontrolled  spread \nof  infectious  diseases,  frayed  and  exposed  electrical wiring,  broken \nwindows,  and  only  three  makeshift washbasins  for every  eighty  men. \nThe  Court  will now  consider each of  the  individual  conditions \nchallenged  by  the  plaintiffs.  Although  the  Eighth Amendment  \"must  draw \nits meaning  from  the  evolving  standards  of decency  that mark  the  progress \nof a  maturing  society.\"  Trop  v.  Dulles,  356  U.S.  86,  101,  78  S.ct.  590, \n2  L.Ed.2d  630  (1957).  such  decisions must  rest on  objective  factors,  and \nnot  the  subjective views  of federal  judges.  Rhodes  v.  Chapman,  452  U.S. \n337  (1981).  Conditions  of confinement  are  unconstitutional  only when \nthey  involve  the wanton  and  unnecessary  infliction of  pain  or when  they \nare  grossly disproportionate  to  the  severity  of  the  crime.  The  Supreme \nCourt  cautioned  the  federal  courts  in Rhodes  that  \"conditions that cannot \nbe  said to be  cruel  and  unusual  under  (objective)  contemporary  standards \nare  not  unconstitutional.  To  the  extent  that  such  conditions  are  restric· \ntive and  even  harsh.  they  are  part  of the  penalty  that criminal  offenders \npay  for  their offenses  against  society.\"  Rhodes  v.  Chapman,  supra  at \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 12 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \n1.  Thirty day  limit on  punitive  isolation. \nAn  inmate  who  violates  institution rules  while  in Second  or Third \nGrade  may  be  sent to  Segregation.  The  inmate  spends  a  minimum  of five \ndays  and  a  maximum  of thirty days  in Segregation.  During  the  trial the \ndefendant  amended  Policy Statement  #3.26  limiting confinement  in Segre \ngation to a  maximum  of  thirty days  to  conform  with  the  mandate  issued  in \nHutto v.  Finney,  437  U.S.  678  (1978).  The  inmate,  however,  may  always \nleave  Segregation before  the  expiration of  the  thirty days  by  sending  a \n\"kite\"  to the  Associate  Warden  - Custody,  stating that  he  desires  to  be \nreleased  and  that he  will  abide  by  the  institution rules  and  regulations. \nThere  is a  ninety  day  per  offense  limit on  the  time  that an  inmate \nmay  be  confined  in either Second  or Third  Grade.  Generally,  the  inmate \nspends  his  first five  days  in Third  Grade  and  the  remainder  of any \nsentence  is  served  in Second  Grade.  The  conditions  in Second  Grade  are \nmuch  less  restrictive than  those  in either Third  Grade  or Segregation, \nand  thus  do  not  constitutionally require  a  thirty day  limitation.  The \nseverity  of  conditions  and  the  length  of confinement  are  interrelated. \nAs  the  conditions  become  less  restrictive,  the  length  of time  that an \ninmate  may  be  so  confined  increases. \nAlthough  inmates  may  be  sentenced  by  the  Disciplinary  Board  to \nfive days  Third  Grade  and  indeterminate  in Second  Grade.  this is not \ntruly  an  indeterminate  sentence  as  long  as  the  maximum  of ninety days \nper  offense  is followed.  Every  inmate  knows  that  if he  abides  by  the \nrules  and  regulations,  the maximum  time  that  he  will  spend  in the  Adjust \nment  Center  is ninety days.  This  does  not  shock  the  Court's  conscience, \nas  did  the  indefinite  sentences  employed  in H-House  in  the  Georgia  penal \n5 \nsystem.  Hardwick  v.  Ault,  447  F.Supp.  116,  126  (M.D.  Ga.  1978). \n~ \n2.  Medical  and  psychiatric  care. \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 13 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \ndenied  medical  and  psychiatric  care.  The  Court  finds  nothing  in the \nrecord  to  support  this  allegation.  There  is evidence  to  support  the \nfact  that inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center do  not  receive  regular visits \nfrom  a  psychologist  or a  psychiatrist.  The  unit manager  in the  Adjust \nment  Center,  however,  holds  a  B.A.  degree  in psychology  and  a  M.A. \ndegree  in guidance  and  counseling.  Inmates  may  also  send  a  \"kite\"  to \ntheir prison counselor,  requesting  that  the  counselor  visit with the \ninmate  in the  Adjustment  Center.  It appears  that medical  care  is pro \n6 \nvided  when  needed  or when  requested  by  an  inmate.\nDeliberate  indifference to  an  inmate's  serious  medical  needs \nviolates  the  Eighth  Amendment.  Estelle v.  Gamble,  429  U.S.  97,  104. \n97  s.ct.  285,  50  L.Ed.2d  251  (1976).  \"In order to  state a  cognizable \nclaim.  a  prisoner must  allege  acts  or omissions  sufficiently harmful  to \nevidence  deliberate  indifference  to  serious medical  needs.  It is only \nsuch  indifference  that  can  offend  'evolving  standards  of decency'  in \nviolation of the  Eighth Amendment.\"  Id.  A medical  need  is  serious  if \nit has  been  diagnosed  by  a  physician as  mandating  treatment  or if it is \nso  obvious  that even  a  lay  person  would  recognize  the  need  for medical \nattention.  Laaman  v.  Helgemoe,  437  F.Supp.  269,  311  (D.  N.H.  1977). \nThe  right to  medical  care  includes  not  only  physical  needs,  but also \npsychological  and  psychiatric  needs.  The  Fourth  Circuit Court  of \nAppeals  has  held that an  inmate  is entitled to  psychological  or \npsychiatric  treatment  if \na  physician or other health care  provider,  exercising \nordinary  skill and  care  at the  time  of  observation,  con \ncludes with  reasonable  medical  certainty  (1)  that  the \nprisoner's symptoms  evidence  a  serious  disease  or injury; \n(2)  that such  disease  or injury  is curable  or may  be \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 14 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nsubstantially alleviated;  and  (3)  that the  potential for \nharm  to the  prisoner by  reason  of delay  or the  denial  of \ncare would  be  substantial.  The  right to  treatment  is,  of \ncourse,  limited to  that which  may  be  provided  upon  a \nreasonable  cost and  time  basis and  the  essential test is \none  of medical  necessity and  not  simply  that which  may \nbe  considered merely  desirable. \n44. \nBowring  v.  Godwin,  551  F.2d  47-48  (4th Cir.  1977). \nInmates  in the  Adjustment  Center.  as  well  as  inmates  in the \ngeneral  population,  are  entitled to  reasonable  psychiatric  and/or \npsychological  treatment when  medically necessary.  When  an  inmate  is \ndiagnosed  under  the Bowring  test as  needing  psychiatric  or psychological \ntreatment.  the defendant  is under  an  affirmative duty  to  provide  such \ncare.  Laaman  v.  Helgemoe,  supra  at 313.  If there  is a  policy  stating \nthat  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center are  not  entitled to the  services \nof a  psychiatrist or a  psychologist,  as  claimed by  the  plaintiffs,  then \nsuch  policy must  be  changed.  This  does  not mean  that  an  inmate  is \nentitled to  such  services  simply because  he  is confined  in the  Adjust \nment  Center.  It simply  means  that  the  defendant  has  an  affirmative duty \nto  provide  psychiatric  care  whenever  it is medically  indicated. \n3.  Lighting. \n7 \nEach  cell  is equipped  with two  lights;  a  sixty watt bulb is \nused  during  the  day  and  a  forty watt  bulb  is used  for night lighting. \nInmates  in Close  Custody  II  are  allowed  to  have  their own  bed  lamps. \nInmates  in the  Adjustment  Center cannot  be  deprived  of  basic \nnecessities.  Adequate  lighting is clearly a  basic  necessity,8 \n7There  is some  conflict  in the  testimony  as  to  whether  the  light \nused  during  the  day  is a  sixty or a  seventy-five watt bulb. \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 15 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nespecially when  inmates  spend  a  minimum  of twenty-three  and  a  half hours \na  day  in their cell.  See  Finney v.  Arkansas  Board  of  Correction,  505 \nF.2d 194.  208  (8th  Cir.  1974).  Reading  is one  of  the  few  activities \navailable to  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center.  This  Court would  agree \nwith the  Seventh  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  that inmates  in the  Adjustment \nCenter must  be  provided with  adequate  light for  reading,  unless  the \ndefendant  can  establish a  rational basis for the  dimly  lit cells. \nBono  v.  Saxbe,  620  F.2d 609,  617  (7th  Cir.  1980). \n4.  Clothing  and  shelter. \nThere  is a  metal  cot  in all the  cells  in the  Adjustment  Center. \nA mattress  is not  required by  the  institution rules  in either Segrega \ntion or Third Grade.  Inmates  in Segregation and  Third  Grade,  however. \nare  provided with two  blankets.  In Second  Grade  and  Close  Custody  II \ninmates  receive  a  mattress,  two  sheets,  a  pillow and  a  pillowcase.  and \ntwo  blankets.  At  the  time  the  Court  toured  the  Adjustment  Center. \nthere  were  mattresses  in all the  cells,  including  those  in Segregation \nand  Third  Grade. \nAt  times  the  metal  cots  have  been  removed  from  some  cells  in \nSegregation.  This  occurs  on  an  individual basis  after an  inmate  has \nfashioned  handmade  weapons  from  parts  of his  bed.  Mattresses  have  also \nbeen  removed  from  cells when  the  inmate  uses  the mattress  to  start a \nfire  in the  Adjustment  Center. \nInmates  in the  Adjustment  Center are  issued  prison coveralls. \nThere  is nothing  in the evidence  to  indicate that the  coveralls  are not \nsufficient to  adequately  clothe  an  inmate. \nThe  State must  furnish  its prisoners with reasonably adequate \nfood,  clothing.  shelter,  sanitation,  medical  care,  and  personal safety. \nThe  Constitution,  however,  does  not  require  that prisoners.  as  indivi-\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 16 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nmark  the  progress  of a  maturing  society,\"  Trop  v.  Dulles,  356  U.S.  86, \n101  (1957),  would  dictate that all inmates  be  provided with  an  adequate \nplace  to  sleep,  which would  include  a  cot,  a  mattress,  and  appropriate \nbedding.  Inmates,  however,  who  abuse  the  privileges afforded  to  them  by \na  \"maturing  society\"  cannot  complain when  those  privileges are  removed, \nat  least for a  short  time.  Institutional security  is of  paramount \nimportance.  Bell v.  Wolfish,  U.S.  520,  547,  99  S.Ct.  1861,  60 \nL~l \nL.Ed.2d  447  (1976).  When  weapons  are  fashioned  from  the  metal  bed \nframes,  when  mattresses  are  set afire,  and  when  bedding  is used  to  clog \nthe  plumbing,  the  defendant  may  deprive  the  offending  inmate  of his  cot, \nor his  mattress,  or  his  bedding  without violating  the  Eighth Amendment. \nAs  the  State noted  in  its brief,  when  weapons  are  fashioned  from  metal \nbed  frames,  \"it would  seem  to  be  a  reasonable  security measure  to \ndeprive  certain inmates,  from  whom  such weapons  have  been  confiscated, \nof their metal  cots,  at least for  a  short period,  provided blankets and \na  mattress  were  provided.\"  (Defendant's  post-trial brief at 23).  The \nCourt  would  find  the  same  reasoning  appropriate  when  an  inmate  burns  his \nmattress.  That  is,  it would  be  a  reasonable  security measure  to \ndeprive  that  inmate  of  a  mattress  for a  short  period  of time,  as  long \nas  he  was  provided with  a  cot  and  a  blanket. \n5.  Ventilation. \nThe  plaintiffs cite Hutto  v.  Finney,  supra,  in  support  of  their \nventilation claim.  The  ventilation problems  in Hutto  were  not  only more \nsevere,  but  they were  also  compounded  by  the  overcrowded  conditions  in \nthe  Arkansas  prison.  The  ventilation  in the  Adjustment  Center,  as \nobserved  by  the  Court  during  its tour,  would  appear  to  be  constitu \ntionally adequate.  Inmates  do  not  have  a  constitutional right to  be \nfree  from  the  mildly  offensive  odor  that permeates  the  entire northern \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 17 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nplaintiffs further  testified that  due  to  this  collection  of garbage, \nthere  are  occasionally  bugs  and  mice  in  the  cellblock.  Prison  authori \nties,  however,  testified that most  of the  litter that  accumulates  in the \ncorridor is thrown  by  the  inmates  from  their cells,  and  that when  they \nare  given an  opportunity  to  clean  the  area,  they  refuse  to do  so.  There \nwas  conflicting testimony  as  to the  actual garbage  collection schedule, \nalthough  garbage  is apparently  removed  periodically for  central collec \ntion. \nThe  accumulation  of  trash and  debris  is a  haven  for  rodents  and \ninfection carrying  insects,  all of which  constitute  a  health hazard. \nA program  of daily  trash collection and  periodic  pest  control must  be \ninstituted  in  order to  provide  inmates  with reasonably  healthy and  safe \nquarters. \n7.  Diet. \nAll  the  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center are  served  commercially \nprepared  frozen  t.v.  dinners.  The  dinners  are  cooked  in an  oven \nlocated  in a  multipurpose  room  in the  Adjustment  Center.  This  policy \nwas  instituted in order to  avoid  the  security problems  encountered  in \ntransporting food  from  the  main  kitchen  to  the  Adjustment  Center,  or \ntransferring  inmates  from  the  Adjustment  Center through  the  general \npopulation to  the  dining  hall.  The  t.v.  dinners  are  supplemented with \nmilk,  coffee,  fresh  fruit at  least  twice  a  day  and  four  slices  of bread \nwith  butter at each  meal.  Testimony  at trial indicated that  there  is \nreasonable variation  in the  meals. \nPrison authorities  must  provide  inmates  with  the basic  necessi \nties  of  life,  including  reasonably  adequate  food.  Newman  v.  state of \nAlabama,  559  F.2d  283.  286  (5th  Cir.  1977).  The  plaintiffs  rely  on \nCampbell  v.  Cauthron,  623  F.2d  503.  508-09  (8th Cir.  1980),  for  the \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 18 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nperson  on  this diet could  lose  up  to  nine  pounds  a  month.  The  defen \ndant's  expert agreed  that  such a  diet  is inadequate,  unless  it is \nsupplemented  with  a  daily addition of vitamin  C-enriched  juice,  a  glass \nof milk  and  a  peanut  butter sandwich.  Further,  Campbell  involved \nconditions  in a  county  jail housing  pre-trial detainees. \nIn  the  present case,  there  has  been no  expert  testimony  indi \ncating that  the  supplemented  t.v.  dinners  are  nutritionally inadequate, \nor that any  of the  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center have  suffered a \nsignificant weight  loss.  Although  a  diet of  t.v.  dinners  may  not  be  the \nmost  interesting,  they  appear  to  be  reasonably  adequate.  Further,  the \ndefendant  has  articulated a  reasonable  rationale  for  implementing  the \nt.v.  dinner policy.  \"Prison administrators  ••• (must)  be  accorded \nwide-ranging  deference  in the  adoption  and  execution  of  policies and \npractices that in their judgment  are  needed  to  preserve  internal order \nand  discipline and  to  maintain  institutional security.\"  Bell v. \nWolfish,  supra,  441  U.S.  at 547  (1979). \n8.  Recreation  and  exercise. \nInmates  in Segregation and  Third  Grade  do  not  receive  any  recre \nation.  Inmates  in Second  Grade  receive  fifteen minutes  of recreation a \nday  and  inmates  in Close  Custody  II  receive  thirty minutes  of  recreation \na  day.  Inmates  in Close  Custody  II also receive  an  occasional  \"rooftop \nrec\"  during  good  weather.  Recreation  for all inmates  in the  Adjustment \nCenter consists  of walking  around  in  the  general  corridor of their cell \nblock. \nThe  plaintiffs are  requesting  a  minimum  exercise  period  of  one \nhour  per day  outside the  cell,  and  \"exercise  equipment  and  facilities \nwhich  provide  a  meaningful  opportunity  for  exercise.\"  (Plaintiffs' \nPost-Trial  Brief at 13).  The  plaintiffs  rely on  Campbell  v.  Cauthron, \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 19 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \ninvolved  conditions  in a  county  jail,  not  conditions  in an  administra \ntive  or a  punitive  segregation  unit.  Even  in Campbell  the  court recog \nnized the  need  to  balance  institutional security with  the  inmate's  need \nfor  physical  exercise  by  stating that exercise  opportunities  could  be \nprovided within the  cell for  those  inmates  that would  present a  security \nrisk  if released  from  their cells.  Id.  at note 4. \nThe  length of confinement  is an  important  consideration in deter \nmining  whether  certain conditions  of  confinement meet  constitutional \nu.s. \nstandards.  Hutto  v.  Finney,  supra,  437  at 686.  The  failure  to \n~ \nprovide  recreation for the  inmates  confined  to  Third  Grade  or Segregation \nfor  five  days  does  not  constitute  enforced  idleness  of  a  sufficient \nduration to  result  in physical degeneration.  Again,  after five  days  in \nSegregation an  inmate  is able  to  send  a  \"kite\"  to  the  Associate Warden  -\nCUstody  requesting  his  release  from  Segregation.  Therefore,  it would  seen \nto  the  Court  that after five  days  in Segregation,  it is the  inmate's \ndecision as  to  whether  he  wants  to  abide  by  the  rules  of  the  institution \nand  thus  move  to  another  section  of the  Adjustment  Center where  recre \nation  is provided.  Under  these  conditions,  the  inmate  is not  denied \nrecreation;  rather he  is making  an  informed  decision as  to whether he \nwants  to  participate  in the  limited  recreation provided  in Second  Grade. \nThe  question  of  the adequacy  of recreation provided  for  the \ninmates  in Second  Grade  and  Close  Custody  II  presents  a  closer  question. \nAlthough  deprivation of exercise does  not per  se  constitute cruel and \nunusual  punishment,  such  a  deprivation  may  impair a  person's  health and \nthus  would  be  forbidden  by  the  Eighth Amendment.  Miller v.  Carson,  563 \nF.2d  741,  751  (5th  Cir.  1977)  citing Estelle v.  Gamble,  429  U.S.  97 \n(1976).  In Hardwick  v.  Ault,  447  F.Supp.  116,  127  (M.D.Ga.  1978),  the \ncourt  found  that two  hours  of  exercise  a  week  in a  very  small  yard \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 20 of 37(cid:10)\n-\n• \nEighth  Amendment  if confined  to  a  relatively  short period  of maximum \nconfinement.  the  rule  may  be  quite different when\"  the  restriction is \nextended  over  an  indefinite period of time.  Sweet v.  South  Carolina \nDept.  of  Corrections.  529  F.2d  854.  866  (4th Cir.  1975). \nThe  Court  is concerned  with  the  limited duration  of  exercise \nprovided  to  the  inmates  in Second  Grade  and  Close  Custody  II,  especially \nwhen  recreation  simply  consists  of wandering  the  narrow  corridor in \nfront  of the  cellblock.  In Second  Grade  the limited  opportunities  for \nrecreation might be  justified by  the  fact  that the  maximum  period of \nconfinement  for anyone  offense  is ninety  days.  Inmates  in  Close \nCustody.  however.  may  spend  an  extended  period  of time  in this unit,  and \nthe  continued  limitation on  exercise  and  recreation may  be  more  serious. \nThe  Court  does  not  wish  to  unduly  interfere with  prison administration \nby  ordering  the  penitentiary to provide  increased  opportunities  for more \nappropriate  recreation and  exercise.  Therefore,  the  Court  is  simply \nrequesting  that the  defendant  reevaluate  the  policies  in the  Adjustment \nCenter  and  CCU  as  they  relate  to  recreation,  and  if pOSSible,  provide \ninmates  with an  appropriate  opportunity to  exercise  for an  increased \nperiod of time  each  day. \n9.  Access  to  the  law  library. \nInmates  in Segregation and  Third  Grade,  according  to written \npolicy.  are  not  allowed  law  books.  The  Unit Manager.  however,  testified \nthat he  believed  that all inmates  had  a  richt  to  law books.  and  there \nfore  he  allowed  inmates  in Segregation and  Third Grade  to  receive  law \nbooks  when  they  requested  them.  Inmates  in Second  Grade  and  Close \nCustody  II  may  receive  four  law  books  from  the  library per week. \nInmates  also  have  access  to  a  photocopy  machine  located  in the  multi \npurpose  room  in the  Adjustment  Center  for  copying  necessary documents. \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 21 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nthe  law.\"  Bounds  v.  Smith,  430  U.S.  817,  828,  97  S.ct.  1491,  52  L.Ed.2d \n72  (1977).  Inmates  in  punitive  isolation cannot  be  denied  total access \nto  the  prison library.  Kirby  v.  Blackledge,  530  F.2d  583,  586  (4th Cir. \n1976);  Knell  v.  Bensinger,  489  F.2d  1014,  1017  (7th Cir.  1973). \nRestricted  access  to  the  law  library,  however,  is not  a  per se violation. \nPrison  regulations  that  reasonably  limit the  time,  place,  and manner  in \nwhich  inmates  may  engage  in  legal  research do  not  violate  constitu \ntionally  protected rights  as  long  as  the  regulations  do  not  frustrate \naccess  to  the courts.  Twyman  v.  CriSp,  584  F.2d  352,  358  (lOth  Cir. \n1978) • \nInmates  in Frazier v.  Ward,  426  F.Supp.  1354  (N.D.N.Y.  1977), \nwere  not  permitted  to  leave  the  segregation unit  to  go  to  the  library; \nrather they  were  permitted,  upon  request,  to  receive  two  law books \nevery  other day  from  the  law  library.  The  court  stated that  this pro \ncedure  did  not violate  constitutional standards  and  that to  order direct \naccess  to  the  library would  \"in effect diminish  the  purposes  of segre \ngated  confinement.\"  Id.  at  1371. \nThere  is no  showing  by  the  plaintiffs that  restricted access  to \nthe  law  library has  denied  inmates  access  to  the  courts.  The  Court, \nhowever,  does  agree  with  the  plaintiffs that  it is nearly  impossible \nto  do  research with  only  four  books  per week.  The  defendant  has  not \npresented  the  Court  with any  rational  reason  or  justification for  this \npolicy.  The  Court  finds  that  in  order  to  protect the  inmates'  funda \nmental  constitutional  right  of access  to  the  courts  all inmates  in the \nAdjustment  Center must  be  allowed  reasonable  access  to  the  law  library. \nIn the  Court's  opinion,  reasonable  access would  allow  inmates  to receive \na  given number  of books  each  day.  Inmates,  of course,  WOuld  be  expeoted \nto  return  the  books  in  their cells before  reoeiving new  books  from  the \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 22 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nInmates  in the  Adjustment  Center  and  CCU  do  not  participate  in \nvocational,  educational,  or work  programs.  The  plaintiffs have \nrequested  that  the  Court  order  the  defendant  to  implement  programs  for \nthe  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center to  occupy  their time  and  to prevent \nmental  and  physical degeneration. \nAlthough  rehabilitation may  be  a  valid  penological  objective, \nprisoners do  not  have  a  constitutional right to  rehabilitation.  Bono  v. \nSaxbe 620  F.2d  609,  615  (7th Cir.  1980).  The  Tenth  Circuit Court  of \nt \nAppeals  held  in Battle v.  Anderson,  564  F.2d  388  (1977),  that  \"while  an \ninmate  does  not  have  a  federal  constitutional  right to  rehabilitation, \nhe  is entitled to be  confined  in an  environment which  does  not  result  in \nhis  degeneration  or which  threatene  his mental  and  physical well  being.\" \nId.  at 403. \nAlthough  the  Court  recognizes.  and  the  defendant  concedes,  that \nforced  idleness  for  the  general  population  on  a  long  term  basis  might \ncause  degeneration,  there  is  no  substantial evidence  that forced  idleness \nfor  limited periods  of  time  in the  Adjustment  Center  result  in mental  and \nphysical degeneration.  Further,  the  defendant  has  articulated a  legitime' \nsecurity interest  in  restricting access  by  inmates  in the  Adjustment \nCenter to work  release.  vocational,  educational,  and  other rehabilitative \nprograms.  The  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center have  been  unable  to \nfunction  effectively  in  the  general  population without  causing  serious \ndisruption.  It is this disruptive  behavior that has  caused  these \ninmates  to  be  segregated  from  the  general  population and  confined  to the \nAdjustment  Center.  It is  therefore  a  justifiable administrative  policy \nto  deny  these  disruptive  inmates  access  to group  rehabilitation programs. \n\"The  Constitution does  not  require  that prisoners,  as  individuals  or as \na  group.  be  provided with  any  and  every amenity which  some  person  may \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 23 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nAdjustment  Center  and  that the defendant  must  be  ordered  to  train guards \nin  firefighting techniques  and  that  an  evacuation  plan must  be  imple \nmented  and  enforced.  At  the  present time  all guards  receive  training  in \nthe  area  of basic  fire  safety techniques. \nThe  Court  recognizes  that all inmates  have  a  basic  right to  be \nsafe  and  secure  in  their place  of confinement.  The  plaintiffs,  however, \nhave  not  convinced  this  Court  that  they  are  not  reasonably  safe while \nconfined  to  the  Adjustment  Center. \nThe  plaintiffs  raise  this  issue  in relation to  a  series  of inmate \noriginated fires where  mattresses  and  debris were  burned  in the  Adjust \nment  center.  Testimony  at trial would  indicate  that prison authorities \nhandled  the  fire  in  a  calm  and  reasonable  manner,  and  that no  serious \ninjuries were  sustained.  The  Sioux  Falls  Fire Department  responded \nquickly  to  the  call for  assistance,  they  put  out  the  fire  and  installed \nfans  to  clear the  area of smoke.  This was  all accomplished  in a  very \nshort  period  of  time,  and  without  injury.  To  release  unnecessarily all \nthe  inmates  confined  in the  Adjustment  Center would  have  presented  a \nsubstantial  security  risk  to  the  institution,  and  in  the  Court's  opinion \nwould  have  been  unwarranted. \n12.  Personal Hygiene. \nInmates  in Segregation are  allowed  one  shower  per week,  while \ninmates  in Third Grade,  Second  Grade,  and  Close  Custody  II are  allowed \ntwo  showers  per week.  All  inmates  have  in their cells a  sink  with hot \nand  cold  running water,  a  hand  towel,  a  bar of  soap,  and  a  partial roll \nof toilet paper.  The  plaintiffs claim  that  two  showers  per week  are \nsimply  inadequate  and  that all inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center must  be \ngiven an  opportunity to  shower  at least once  every  two  days.  The  defen \ndant  argues  that  the  basic necessities  for  personal  hygiene  are  provided \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 24 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \na  value  judgment.  A request  that all inmates  receive  a  shower every \nother day  is certainly a  reasonable  request,  in the  Courtts  opinion, \nespecially when  the  defendant  has  not  attempted to  provide  a  rational \njustification for  the  present  shower  policy.  The  Court  would  suggest \nthat  the  defendant  reevaluate  the  rationale  for the  present  shower  policy \nand  if possible allow  inmates  to  shower  on  a  more  regular basis.  The \npresent  policy,  however,  although  arbitrary,  is not  totally shocking  to \nthe  conscience,  and  does  not  rise  to  the  level of a  constitutional \nviolation,  unless  inmates  can  show  that  they  suffer health problems  as \na  direct result of this  policy. \nAlthough the  Court  is requesting  that the  defendant  reevaluate \nthe  shower  policy,  the  Court  is not willing  to  interfere with  the  day \nto  day  administration of the  Adjustment  Center by  ordering  that the \ndefendant  institute  a  policy  of allowing  inmates  to  shower  every  other \nday.  See  Bell v.  Wolfish,  supra,  441  U.S.  520  (1979). \n13.  Dark  cells. \nThere  are  two  dark  cells in the  Segregation unit.  These  cells \ncontain only  a  commode  and  a  diagonal  metal  bar attached  to  the  wall. \nA large wooden  door  on  the  front  of the  cell may  be  closed  to  completely \nblock  out  light from  the  cell.  Testimony  at trial indicated  that these \ncells are  seldom  used,  and  that by  unwritten  policy an  inmate  could  only \nbe  confined  to  a  dark  cell for  a  period  of twenty-four hours.  The  dark \ncells  are  used  to  protect  an  inmate  from  himself  or to  protect  others \nfrom  the  inmate.  Further testimony  as  to  the  actual  conditions  in the \ndark  cells  is sketchy  at best.  For  example,  there  is no  evidence  as  to \nwhether an  inmate  is stripped before  going  to  the  dark  cell,  whether  the \ninmate  receives  regular meals,  and  whether  the  inmate  is allowed  even \ntwo  blankets.  The  plaintiffs claim  that  the  conditions  of confinement \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 25 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \n501  F.2d,  1291,  1305  (5th Cir.  1974),  the  court  refused  to  totally \nenjoin  the  use  of dark  cells  in all circumstances.  The  Court  in Gates, \nhowever,  placed very  strict restrictions on  the  conditions  in the  dark \ncells,  including maximum  confinement  of twenty-four hours. \nThe  defendant  must  develop  and  implement  policies  regarding  the \nuse  of the  dark  cells.  The  policies  must  explicitly  set forth  the \ncircumstances  under which  an  inmate  could be  confined  to  a  dark  cell and \nthe  conditions  of  confinement while  in  the  dark  cell.  Further,  confine \nment  in  a  dark  cell must  be  limited to  a  maximum  period  of twenty-four \nhours.  This  is not  to  say  that  the  dark  cell cannot  be  used  as  a \nregular  cell in the  segregation unit,  if the wooden  door  remains  open \nand  the  inmate  in the  cell  is afforded  all the  rights  and  privileges \ngenerally allowed  in Segregation. \n14.  strip searches. \nAll  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center are  allowed  attorney visits. \nThe  inmates  in Second  Grade  and  Close  Custody  II are  also  allowed  non \ncontact visits.  In  a  noncontact  visit there  is a  plexiglass  divider \nbetween  the  inmate  and  his visitor,  and  they  communicate  by  phone. \nInmates  are  strip-searched  upon  entering  or leaving  the  Adjustment \nCenter.  The  inmates  are  escorted,  in handcuffs,  to  and  from  their \ndestinations. \nStrip-searches  routinely administered  and  not  based  on  probable \ncause  or directly related  to  prison  security constitute cruel and \nunusual  punishment.  Bono  v.  Saxbe,  620  F.2d  609,  617  (7th  Cir.  1980); \nHurley  v.  Ward,  584  F.2d  609,  611  (2nd  Cir.  1978);  Frazier v.  Ward, \n426  F.Supp.  1354.  1366  (N.D.N.Y.  1977). \nRoutine  strip-searches  of  inmates  returning  to  the  Adjustment \nCenter from  noncontact visits  must  be  immediately  discontinued.

The  charging  officer,  the  investigating  officer,  or any \nperson  having  personal  knowledge  of any  material  fact  of the  alleged \nviolation cannot  sit on  the  Disciplinary Board. \nThe  following  procedures  are  followed  by  the  Disciplinary  Board \nfor  all major  rules  infractions.  The  report  of a  rules  infraction must \nbe  submitted  in writing  by  the  charging  officer.  The  inmate  must \nreceive a  Rule  Infraction Report  containing a  statement  of the  charge \nat least four days  before  the  hearing date.  The  inmate  also  receives \ntwo  copies  of  the  Notice  of Violation,  which  contains  the  number  of the \nrule  allegedly violated,  the  adverse  witnesses  that may  be  called at the \nhearing,  and  the  evidence  that may  be  produced  at the  hearing.  On  part \nB of the  form  the  inmate  may  plead  guilty,  not  guilty,  or no  contest. \nIf the  inmate  chooses  to  plead not  guilty or no  contest he  will  receive \n9 \nan  adversary hearing  before  the  Disciplinary Board. The  inmate  haa \nthe  right to  be  represented by  a  member  of the  noncustodial  staff, \nusually his  assigned  counselor,  to  appear pro  se,  or to  retain  counsel \nat his  expense.  The  inmate  has  the  right  to  cross-examine  witnesses \nat the  hearing,  and  to  call witnesses  in his defense,  subject to  certain \nsecurity restrictions  imposed  by  the  Disciplinary Board. \nThe  inmate  remains  in the  general  population pending  the  hearing, \nunless  the  officer in  charge  determines  that  the  inmate  represents  a \nthreat  to  institutional security or discipline.

Inmates  sentenced  to the  Adjustment  Center by \nthe  DisCiplinary  Board  receive  credit for  the  time  spent  in the  Adjust \nment  Center  pursuant  to  a  detention order. \nThe  inmate  receives  the  written findings  of the  Disciplinary \nBoard  following  the  hearing.  The  report  of  the Disciplinary Board \nincludes a  summary  of the witnesses  and  testimony  presented  by  the \ninstitution,  a  summary  of the  witnesses  and  testimony  presented by  the \ninmate,  a  summary  of the  evidence  supporting  the  Board's  deCision,  the \nBoard's  deCision,  the  sentence  imposed,  and  the  number  of days  credit \nfor  time  spent  in administrative detention.  This  report  is Signed by \nthe  three  members  of the  Disciplinary Board  and  the  inmate. \nIf the  inmate  is  sentenced  to  time  in  the  Adjustment  Center the \nsentence will be  either five  days  Third  Grade  and  a  given number  of \ndays  Second  Grade,  or five  days  Third  Grade  and  indeterminate  Second \nGrade.  The  majority  of inmates  receive  indeterminate  sentences  in \nSecond  Grade.  The  maximum  time  that an  inmate  can  spend  in the  Adjust \nment  Center  per  offense  is ninety  days. \nThe  inmate  confined  to  the  Adjustment  Center  on  an  indeterminate \nsentence  is reviewed  by  the  Review  Board  twenty  days  after the  imposition \nof  sentence.  If continued  confinement  in the  Adjustment  Center  is \nordered,  the  inmate  is  reviewed  at  least once  every  fifteen days  until \nreleased.  The  inmate  is not  present  at the  review  hearing.  The  inmate \nreceives  a  written report  from  the  Review  Board  indicating whether  his \nconfinement  in  the  Adjustment  Center  is to  continue  and  the  date  of the \nnext  review  hearing.  The  report does  not  apprise  the  inmate  of  the \nreasons  for  continued  confinement  or what  the  inmate  must  do  to  be \nreleased from  the  Adjustment  Center.  The  Review  Board  is composed  of \nthe  Disciplinary Officer,  a  ranking  officer,  and  a  member  of the non-\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 28 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \na  maximum  of thirty days  in Segregation.  The  inmate's  total time  in the \nAdjustment  Center,  however,  cannot  exceed  the  original ninety  days  unless \nhe  receives  a  due  process  hearing before  the  Disciplinary Board  on  the \nlater rules  infraction. \nAnalysis \nWhen  an  inmate  is charged  with a  major  rules  infraction,  he  is \nafforded  a  full  due  process  hearing,  which  meets  the  requirements  set \nforth  by  the  Supreme  Court  in Wolff  v.  McDonnell,  418  U.S.  539,  563-70, \n94  S.ct.  2963,  41  L.Ed.2d  935  (1974).  The  plaintiffs concede  that \ninmates  receive  a  due  process  hearing  before  the  Disciplinary  Board \nbefore  a  transfer is made  from  the  general  population to  the  Adjustment \nCenter.  The  plaintiffs,  however,  argue  that before  an  inmate  can be \ntransferred  from  Second  or Third  Grade  to Segregation he  is again \nentitled to  a  full  blown  due  process  hearing,  because  the  inmate's \nprivileges  are  being  further  limited.  The  defendant  contends  that  the \ntransfer of  an  inmate  from  one  level  in the  Adjustment  Center to  another \nlevel constitutes an  intra-institution transfer and  does  not  require a \ndue  process  hearing  as  long  as  the  inmate's  total time  in  the  Adjustment \nCenter does  not  exceed  the  ninety  day  maximum  allowed  as  a  result of the \ninitial sentence. \nThe  right  to  a  minimum  due  process  hearing  before  being  placed  in \npunitive  segregation was  established  in Wolff  v.  McDonnell,  supra.  The \nSouth Dakota  State  Penitentiary fully  complies  with  the  Wolff  requirements \nprior to  confining  an  inmate  in the  Adjustment  Center. \nThe  plaintiffs claim  that an  inmate  is entitled to  a  full  due \nprocess  hearing  prior to  confinement  in the  Segregation unit.  The \nplaintiffs reason  that  an  inmate  in Second  or Third  Grade  has  a  justi \nfiable  expectation  that he  will not  be  arbitrarily moved  from  Second  or \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 29 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nSegregation.  The  conditions  in all levels  of  the  Adjustment  Center are \nessentially  the  same.  The  only distinction between  the  various  levels \n10 \nare  the  privileges  afforded  to  the  inmate. Prison authorities must  be \nallowed  some  discretion in the  meting  out of disciplinary measures  and \nsome  flexibility  in  the  implementation  of penal  programs  in  order to \nmeet  institutional needs  and  goals.  Glouser v.  Parratt,  605  F.2d \n~ \n419,  420-21  (8th Cir.  1979).  Absent  an  unreasonable  or arbitrary \nexercise  of  this discretion.  this Court  is not  willing  to  interfere \nwith day  to  day  programming  within  the  Adjustment  Center. \nThe  plaintiffs also  challenge  indeterminate  confinement  in the \nAdjustment  Center without  meaningful  review based  on  objective criteria. \nIndeterminate  confinement  is not  a  constitutional deprivation per set \nSweet v.  South  Carolina  Department  of  Corrections,  529  F.2d  854.  861 \n(4th Cir.  1975).  The  defendant  concedes  that Kelly  v.  Brewer,  525  F.2d \n394  (8th  Cir.  1975),  does  require  a  periodic  review  of  confinement \nunder an  indeterminate  sentence.  The  defendant,  however.  argues  that \nthe  inmate  is  not  entitled to  a  full  blown  due  process  hearing  each \ntime  he  comes  up  for  review.  The  Court  would  agree.  The  following \nminimal  procedures,  however,  are  required  in  order  to  provide  the  inmate \nwith  a  meaningful  review.  The  inmate  must  be  allowed  advance  notice  of \nthe  hearing  date  and  the  opportunity  to  submit  a  written  statement  to \nthe  Review  Board.  If confinement  on  an  indefinite  sentence  is continued, \nthe  inmate  must  receive  written notice  of  the  reasons  for  continued \nconfinement.  the  conduct  that  is expected  in  order that the  inmate  may \nbe  released  to  the  general  population.  and  the  objective  criteria that \nlOAll  cells  in the  Adjustment  Center are  the  same  size and \ncontain.  at a  minimum,  a  sink  with  running  hot  and  cold \nwater,  a  commode.  a  metal  cot,  and  a  low  density  light. \n_4:...................... \ntY __ •  _ ....  ....,....~  'U,I!'lJ, ....... + ..

Brewer,  525  F.2d  394.  397  (8th Cir.  1975). \nAdministrative Segregation:  Close  Custody  II \nFacts \nThe  Close  Custody  Unit  is used  to  provide  \"more  secure  housing \nand  control  of those  inmates  who  have  not  responded  to  counselling  or \nconventional disciplinary  sanctions  and  who  are flagrantly  or chroni \ncally disruptive  of good  order or security.\"  (Exhibit 7,  Policy State \nment  #2.28). \nClose  Custody  II is not  to be  used  as  punishment.  Criteria for \nplacement  in CCU  include: \na.  Presentence  or background  investigations  indicating an \nunstable  personality and/or aggressive  nature. \nb.  A chronic  inability to  adjust  to  the  general  penitentiary \npopulation. \nc.  The  inmate  constitutes a  serious or continuing  threat to \nthe  security of the  institution or to  staff members  or to \nother inmates. \n(Exhibit 7,  Policy  Statement  62.28). \nPlacement  in  CCU  is determined  by  the  Classification Board.  The \nClassification Board  is composed  of  five  members,  at least two  of which \nmust  be  members  of  the  Programs  Department.  Originally  inmates were \nsent  to  CCU  without  notice  and  a  hearing.  During  the  trial the  defen \ndant  proposed  to  change  the  procedures  employed  by  the  Classification \nBoard  that  inmates  would  receive  a  formal  due  process  hearing  prior \n60 \nto  placement  in CCU.  (See  Exhibit  F).  It is the  Court's understanding \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 31 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nClassification Board  by  any  Associate  Warden  or Captain who  has  investi \ngated  recommendations  made  by  subordinate  staff.  The  following  are  the \nproposed  procedures  for  classification hearings  for  CCU.  Written notice \nof the  hearing  to  increase  the  inmate's  custody  classification to  Close \nCustody  II  must  be  given to  the  inmate  at  least twenty-four hours  before \nthe  hearing.  The  inmate  may  be  represented  by  his  counselor at the \nhearing.  The  inmate  may  be  present at  the  hearing  and  may  present a \nstatement and/or documentary  evidence.  The  Committee's  decision and \nthe  rationale  for  the decision  must  be  submitted  to the  inmate  in \nwriting.  The  need  for  continued  confinement  in CCU  is reviewed  by  the \nClassification Board  at least  once  every  sixty days.  The  inmate  may \nattend  the  review hearing  and  may  submit  a  statement  to  the  Board.  The \nClassification Review  Board  must  submit  a  written statement  to the \ninmate  if classification in  CCU  is continued. \nThe  plaintiffs claim  that  they  have  a  protected  liberty interest \nin remaining  in the  general  population and  therefore  they  cannot  be \nreclassified to  CCU  without  a  formal  due  process  hearing.  The  defen \ndant,  on  the  other  hand,  argues  that  classification is a  discretionary \nadministrative  function and  therefore  the transfer of an  inmate  from  the \ngeneral  population  to CCU  does  not  require  a  formal  due  process  hearing. \nAnalysiS \nEnomoto  v.  Wright,  462  F.Supp.  397  (N.D.  Cal.  1976),  aff'd 434 \nu.s. \n1052  (1978),  held  that  \"the  inmate  has  an  interest,  conferred  by \nstatewide  regulation and  protected  by  due  process,  in not  being confined \nin maximum  security segregation  unless  he  is  found,  for  clearly docu \n1£. \nmented  reasons,  to  come  within  the  standard  set by  the  rules.\"  at \n403.  Just as  in Enomoto,  the  rules  and  regulations  governing  the  South \nDakota  Penitentiary have  created a  justifiable expectation  that an \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 32 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \ncreated right  is not  arbitrarily abrogated.  Wolff v.  McDonnell,  supra, \n418  U.S.  at 557  (1974);  Enomoto  v.  Wright,  supra,  462  F.Supp.  at 402. \nWhenever  an  inmate  is transferred  from  the  general  population to \nmaximum  security,  whether  it involves  punitive  segregation or adminis \ntrative  segregation,  and  the  inmate  suffers  a  grievous  loss  of  liberty \ndue  to  the  conditions  of confinement,  he  is entitled to notice  and  a \nhearing  that meets  the  minimum  due  process  requirements  announced  in \nWolff.  Vitek  v.  Jones,  445  u.s.  480,  488  (1980);  Enomoto  v.  Wright. \nsupra at 402.  The  defendant  argues  that the  conditions  in Close  Custody \nII,  other than meals.  recreation time,  and  intermingling with the \ngeneral  population,  are  identical  to  those  enjoyed  by  the  general  popula \ntion.  Such  a  statement  is  patently  false.  Inmates  in CCU  are  not  able \nto  participate  in group  educational.  vocational,  or rehabilitation \nprograms.  Inmates  in CCU  are  not  eligible for work  assignments,  or work \nrelease  programs,  nor  are  they  allowed  access  to  the  recreation  center, \nor to  conduct  research  in the  law  library.  They  are  not  allowed  contact \nvisits,  and  their opportunity  to  shower  is restricted.  Although  inmates \nin CCU  are  able  to  have  personal  effects.  such as  a  radio,  t.v.,  and \ntape  player  in  their cells,  the  conditions  of  confinement  are  certainly \nmore  onerous  than  those  in the  general  population. \nFurther,  the  defendant's  reliance  on  Meachum  v.  Fano,  427  U.s.  215 \n96  S.Ct.  2532,  49  L.Ed.2d  451  (1976),  and  Montanye  v.  Haymes,  427  u.s. \n236,  96  S.ct.  2543,  49  L.Ed.2d  466  (1976),  is misplaced.  These  cases \nhold  that  an  inmate  may  be  transferred  from  one  prison  to  another \nwithout  a  due  process  hearing,  even  though  the  conditions  in the  new \nprison are  more  onerous  than  those  prevailing  in the  prison where  the \ninmate  was  previously confined.  The  Court  reasoned  that an  inmate  does \nnot  have  a  protected  liberty interest  in being  confined  in a  given \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 33 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nauthorities,  especially when  the  inmate was  transferred  from  the  general \npopulation  of  one  institution to  the  general  population of another \ninstitution.  Furthermore,  Meachum  and  Montanye  hold  that if the  state \nimposes  limits  on  the  discretion  of  prison authorities,  by  statute, \nrule,  or regulation,  so  that  transfer decisions  depend  on  a  specific \nstandard  being met,  the  state has  created  a  liberty interest which  must \nbe  protected  by  due  process.  Wright  v.  Enomoto,  supra,  462  F.Supp.  at \n402. \nThe  Court  holds  that  the  Classification Board  must  comply  with \nminimum  due  process  procedures,  as  outlined  in Exhibit  F,  before  trans \nferring  an  inmate  from  the  general  population  to  CCU.  If the  defendant \nhas  not  implemented  these  procedures,  he  must  do  so  immediately. \nIn addition to  the  procedures  presently followed  by  the  Classi \nfication Review  Board,  the  Board must  provide  inmates  with a  list of the \nrelevant  objective  criteria that  is applied  by  the  Board.  vfuen  classi \nfication  in CCU  is continued,  the  Board  must  provide  the  inmate with  the \nreasons  for  continued  confinement  and  the  conduct  that  is required  of \nthe  inmate  for  return to  the  general  population.

Ill.  1978). \nEQUAL  PROTECTION \nIn their third cause  of action the  plaintiffs claim  that Native \nAmericans  as  a  subclass are  discriminated  against  in the disciplinary \nprocess,  in that Native  American  inmates  are  more  often  sent to  the \nAdjustment  Center by  the  Disciplinary Board,  and  that  these  inmates \nspend  a  longer period  of time  in the  Adjustment  Center  than white  inmates \nThe  central purpose  of  the  Equal  Protection Clause  of the \nFourteenth Amendment  is  to  prevent  official  conduct  which  results  in \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 34 of 37(cid:10)\nestablish a  racially disproportionate  impact,  they  must  then  prove  that \nthe  racially disproportionate  impact  resulted  from  a  racially motivated \npurpose.  A discriminatory  purpose  may  be  inferred  from  the  totality of \nthe  circumstances,  including  statistical evidence,  when  the  statistical \nevidence  shows  a  gross  disparity which  adversely  impacts  on  a  particular \nrace.  Inmates  of Nebraska  v.  Greenholtz,  567  F.2d  1368,  1374-75  (8th \n841 \nCir.  1977),  cert.  denied  439  U.S.  (1978). \nThe  plaintiffs compiled  data  from  the  prison disciplinary files \nfor  a  three-year period  beginning  January  1,  1977.  encoded  this data,  and \nthrough  lengthy  computer  printouts  attempted  to  establish a  significant \nracial  imbalance  in the  Adjustment  Center.  In  the  initial computer  run, \nthe  effects  of  recidivism  and  multiple  infractions were  not  considered. \nIn a  supplemental  computer  run,  presented as  rebuttal  evidence,  the \nplaintiffs'  expert  attempted  to  take  into  account  recidivism. \nWhen  recidivism  is considered,  the  plaintiffs'  statistics show \nthat Native  American  single  offenders  receive  slightly more  severe \nsentences  than white.  and  are  more  often placed  on  prehearing  detention, \nalthough,  as  a  group,  Native  American  single  offenders  spent  relatively \nfew  days  in the  Adjustment  Center.  For double  offenders  the  statistics \n.... ere  completely  reversed,  with whites:,  as  a  group,  receiving  more  severe \nsentences  and  more  often  held  on  e  pre hearing  detention order.  For \nmultiple  offenders  there were  only  slight disparities  between  Native \nAmerican  and white  inmates.  In  commenting  on  the statistics,  the  plain \ntiffs'  expert stated  that  \"the  data  for whites  and  Native  Americans  are \nquite  comparable  (for double  and  multiple  offenders)  and  it appears  that \nthe  degree  of severity of  sentence  depends  upon  the  number  of  infractions \nthat  they  have  received,\"  (Exhibit  22  at p.  42).  It appears  that \nrecidivism,  and  not  raCism,  accounts  for the  sentenCing  disparities. \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 35 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \n. \n. \nthe  fact  that the  only  controlled variable  in the  plaintiffs'  evidence \nwas  race.  It is obvious  that the  Disciplinary Board  must  consider a \nnumber  of  important  factors  in  rendering  its decision,  and  these  other \nfactors  have  not been considered  or incorporated  into  the  plaintiffs' \nevidence. \nThe  plaintiffs have  also attempted  to  show  that Native  American \ninmates  receive  harsher sentences  from  the  Disciplinary  Board  when \ncharged  with  a  violation that  requires  a  more  subjective determination \nof gll:1t,  i.e.,  insolence.  The  plaintiffs'  statistics  in this area, \nhowever,  are  severely flawed  in that it does  not  consider  multiple \ninfractions.  Therefore,  an  inmate  charged  with  insubordination, \nattempted  assault  of another  inmate,  and  assault  of a  guard  could  be \nsentenced  to  time  in the  Adjustment  Center based  on  the  cumulative \nseriousness  of the  alleged violations.  According  to  the  plaintiffs' \neVidence,  however,  the  inmate  was  sentenced  to  time  in the  Adjustment \nCenter  for  insubordination,  simply  because  that was  the  first offense \nlisted on  the  Notice  of Violation,  and  therefore  the  offense  that was \nencoded  by  the  plaintiffs. \nBased on  all the  evidence  adduced  at trial,  the Court  finds  that \nthe  plaintiffs  have  not  produced  sufficient evidence  of a  racially \ndisproportionate  impact  so  as  to  establish a  prima  facie  case  of racial \ndiscrimination. \nCONCLUSION \nIn  summary,  the  Court  holds  that this case  was  properly maintained \nas  a  class action pursuant  to Rules  23(a)  and  (b)  of the  Federal  Rules  of \nCivil  Procedure,  and  that  the  plaintiffs,  Dale  Clark  and  Elroy  Wabasha, \nproperly  represent  and  adequately  protect the  interests of the  class. \nIn  considering  the  totality of  the circumstances  as  they exist in \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 36 of 37(cid:10)\n•  • \nclothing,  shelter,  sanitation,  medical  care,  and  personal  safety. \nTherefore,  the  Court  holds  that the  basic  conditions  existing  in the \nAdjustment  Center  are well within  constitutional standards  and  do  not \nviolate  the  Eighth  Amendment.  The  Court  has  addressed  each  of the \nspecific conditions  challenged  by  the  plaintiffs,  and  has  determined \nthat many  of the  policies  and  practices  need  to  be  reevaluated by  the \ndefendant.  The  Court  does  not  wish  to  unduly  interfere with  the \nadministration of  the  South  Dakota  Penitentiary,  and  therefore,  the \nCourt  is  requesting  that the  defendant  develop  new  policies  and  pro \ncedures  for  the  Adjustment  Center.  The  changes  in  existing policies \nand  procedures  should  address  the  concerns  expressed by  the  Court.  If \na  given change  is  impracticable,  the  defendant  should  present  to  the \nCourt  a  rational  justification as  to why  the  change  would  interfere \nwith  internal order,  discipline,  and  institutional security. \nThe  following  briefly summarizes  the  Court's  position on  each \nof the  challenged  conditions. \n1.  There  must  be  a  thirty day  limit on  the  time  spent  in \nSegregation,  and  a  ninety  day  limit on  the  time  spent \nin punitive  segregation for anyone  offense. \n2.  Psychiatric  care  must  be  provided  to  inmates  in the \nAdjustment  Center whenever  it is medically  indicated. \n3.  Adequate  lighting must  be  provided. \n4. \nInmates  must  be  provided with  a  cot,  a  mattress,  and \nappropriate  bedding,  with  the  understanding that an \ninmate  may  be  deprived  of anyone  of  these  items  if \nhe  uses  them  in a  destructive manner. \n5.  Adequate  sanitation,  including a  program  of daily  trash \ncollection and  periodic  pest  control,  must  be  provided. \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 49     Filed 06/12/2002     Page 37 of 37(cid:10)\n• \n• \n. \n. \n8.  The  recreation and  exercise  policy  must  be  reevaluated, \nespecially in Second  Grade  and  Close  Custody  II. \n9.  The  policy on  access  to  law books  must  be  reevaluated. \n10.  Rehabilitation programs  are  not  constitutionally mandated. \n11.  The  fire  protection program,  through  the  Sioux  Falls  Fire \nDepartment,  appears  to  be  adequate. \n12.  The  shower  policy  must  be  reevaluated. \n13.  Written policies  regarding  use  of the  dark  cells must  be \ndeveloped. \n14. \nStrip-searches without  probable  cause  must  be  discontinued. \nIn relation to  the  due  process  claims,  the  evidence  indicates \nthat  inmates  receive  a  due  process  hearing  prior to  confinement  in \npunitive  segregation.  The  Court  holds  that this  satisfies the  require \nments  of due  process  and  that  inmates  may  be  transferred  from  Second  or \nThird  Grade  to Segregation without  another due  process  hearing,  as  long \nas  the  inmate  is not  confined  in the  Adjustment  Center  for more  than \nninety days  for  anyone  offense.  The  defendant  has  proposed  due  process \nhearing  procedures  for  classification of an  inmate  to  Close  Custody  II. \nIf these  procedures  have  not  already been  implemented,  they must  be \nimplemented  immediately. \nFinally,  the  Court  finds  that  the  plaintiffs have  failed  to make \nout  a  prima  facie  case  of racial discrimination  in support  of their \nequal  protection claim. \nAccordingly,  it is ORDERED  that  the  defendant  submit  to  the \nCourt,  within  thirty days  from  receipt  of this order,  detailed policies \nand  procedures  relating to  the  Adjustment  Center.  At  the  time  that the \npolicies and  procedures  have  been  approved  by  the  Court,  an  appropriate \njudgment  will be  entered. ",

      "text": "580 F.Supp. 448 (1984)\nElroy WABASHA, et al., Plaintiffs,\nv.\nHerman SOLEM, Warden, South Dakota State Penitentiary, Defendant.\nNo. CIV79-4064.\nUnited States District Court, D. South Dakota S.D.\nFebruary 7, 1984.\n444590 *449*450 Terry H. Gilbert, Christopher D. Stanley, Cleveland, Ohio, and Douglas P. Cummings, Jr., Sioux Falls,\nS.D., for plaintiffs.\nMark V. Meierhenry, Atty. Gen., of South Dakota, and Mark W. Barnett, Asst. Atty. Gen., Pierre, S.D., for\ndefendant.\nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER\nNICHOL, Senior District Judge.\nThis action involves an application on behalf of the plaintiffs for an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\nsection 1988. Plaintiffs premised their application for attorneys' fees upon the judgment filed by this Court on\nFebruary 18, 1983. Plaintiffs' application presented the following issues: (1) whether the plaintiffs were \"prevailing\nparties\" pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983; and (2) if the plaintiffs were prevailing parties, what constitutes a\n\"reasonable fee\" under the circumstances?\nResolving these issues requires an examination of the nature and results of the underlying litigation. The\nfollowing is a summary of the unpublished memorandum decision and order of this Court in the underlying action.\n[1]\nWabasha v. Solem, 79-4064 (D.S.D. April 13, 1982).  Plaintiffs on May 21, 1979, filed a class action suit against\nthe defendant Herman Solem, on behalf of all Native American inmates confined in the Adjustment Center at the\nSouth Dakota Penitentiary. This class action civil rights suit brought under 42 U.S.C. sections 1983, 1985, and\n1986, alleged that the conditions of confinement in the Adjustment Center constituted cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The\ncomplaint further alleged that the procedures governing initial confinement in the Adjustment Center and transfers\nwithin the Adjustment Center violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of procedural due process\nand also that these procedures violated equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nA motion for a preliminary injunction was filed simultaneously with the complaint; however, no hearing was\nrequested or held at that time. The defendant answered the complaint on June 12, 1979. On June 2, 1980, at the\nsecond pretrial conference the plaintiff class was enlarged, over the objection of the defendant, to include all\ninmates who have or will be subjected to disciplinary confinement in the Adjustment Center with a subclass of all\nNative American inmates. The Court certified the class, as amended, at the pretrial conference but reserved\nruling on whether the plaintiffs fairly and adequately protected the interests of the class, as required by Fed.R.\nCiv.P. 23(a)(4).\nA court trial commenced on June 3, 1980. The trial included a tour of the Adjustment Center by the Court on June\n3, 1980. In open court on June 6, 1980, the plaintiffs renewed their previous motion for a preliminary injunction.\nThis motion sought to enjoin the defendant from confining any inmates in the plaintiff class to the segregation\nsection (most restrictive level of confinement) of the Adjustment Center for a period in excess of thirty (30) days.\nA hearing was held on the motion on June 9, 1980, at which the defendant agreed to change the written policy\nregarding the confinement in the punitive segregation section of the Adjustment Center by amending Policy\nStatement 3-26 of the Living Guide and Regulation of the South Dakota Penitentiary 1976. This change in written\n\npolicy limited confinement in the segregation unit to a maximum of thirty (30) days. The defendant, however,\ncontended that this amendment reflected only a change in written policy but not a change in actual practice since\nno one had been confined to segregation more than nine (9) days since August, 1978. The Court denied the\nplaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction since the amendment of the policy obviated the need for the\nrequested relief.\n451 The trial reconvened December 8, 1980, and continued through December 11, 1980. *451 The Court filed its\nmemorandum decision and order on April 13, 1982. Four issues were presented to the Court for resolution:\n(1) Whether the action was properly maintained as a class action;\n(2) Eighth Amendment issues related to confinement in the Adjustment Center;\n(3) Due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments) contentions with respect to disciplinary and\nclassification procedures governing placement and detention in the Adjustment Center; and\n(4) Racial discrimination as to placement and continued confinement in the Adjustment Center\nunder the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe Court held that the plaintiffs' action was properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a),\n(b). The Court did not, however find that the conditions in the Adjustment Center when considered in toto to be\nintolerable or shocking to the conscience under the Eighth Amendment test established in Trop v. Dulles, 356\nU.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958); See also, Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565,\n57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); Bono v. Saxbe, 620 F.2d 609 (7th Cir.1980). The Court did, however, advise the\ndefendant to consider changing or modifying certain individual conditions and found that there were some\nconditions that must be changed.\nThe Court considered separately the individual conditions challenged by the plaintiffs on constitutional grounds. A\nsummary of the Court's findings with respect to each of the challenged conditions are as follows:\n(1) Thirty day limit on punitive isolation 00\n97\n(a) Segregation00The 5-day minimum and 30-day maximum pursuant to the amended policy\n97\nstatement #3.26 conformed to Hutto v. Finney, supra, and was not unconstitutional;\n(b) Third Grade00The 5-day minimum and 90-day maximum per offense on the time of\n97\nconfinement did not violate the Eighth Amendment;\n(c) Second Grade00The 5-day minimum and 90-day maximum per offense on the time of\n97\nconfinement did not violate the Eighth Amendment.\n(2) Medical and psychiatric care00No Eighth Amendment violation as to medical and psychiatric\n97\ncare were found. The Court specifically found that medical care was provided when needed and\nwhen requested and found for purposes of clarification that psychiatric care like medical care must\nbe provided when medically indicated.\n(3) Lighting00That the inmates in the Adjustment Center were deprived of adequate lighting00a\n97 97\nbasic necessity.\n(4) Clothing and shelter00the Court held that inmates must be provided with a cot, a mattress, and\n97\nappropriate bedding, which may be taken away if they are used in a destructive manner or the\nprivileges are abused. The Court did not, however, find any violations of this requirement in fact in\nthe Adjustment Center but merely established this requirement for future guidance.\n(5) Ventilation00The ventilation was found to be constitutionally adequate.\n97\n(6) Sanitation00the Court prescribed that a program of daily trash collection and periodic pest\n97\ncontrol must be instituted, but did not, however, find any Eighth Amendment constitutional\nviolations.\n\n(7) Diet00No constitutional violations were found. The T.V. dinners provided were adequate as long\n97\nas supplements were provided.\n(8) Recreational exercise00\n97\n(a) Segregation and Third Grade00No recreation was allowed or provided by institution policy. The\n97\nCourt found that under the conditions existing in the Adjustment Center005-day minimum in\n97\nconnection with the opportunity to obtain release via a \"kite\"00no denial of recreational opportunity\n97\n452 existed *452 but an informed choice not to participate in the limited recreation allowed in Second\nGrade.\n(b) Second Grade and Close Custody II (CCU)00Inmates were allowed 15 minutes of recreation\n97\nper day in Second Grade and 30 minutes per day in CCU. The Court, however, expressed\nconcern over the limited duration of exercise and nature of the recreation provided, but stopped\nshort of finding any constitutional violations. The Court requested the defendant to reevaluate his\npolicies relating to recreation and exercise but did not order any changes.\n(9) Access to the law library00Inmates in the Adjustment Center were not denied access to the\n97\ncourts as a result of the limited access to the law library, hence the Court found no constitutional\nviolations. The Court, however, prescribed that reasonable access must be provided to all inmates\nin the Adjustment Center. Reasonable access would still allow a given number of books per day\nand require the return of the books before new books could be received. The Court directed the\ndefendant to formulate a plan which would allow reasonable access to law books to all inmates in\nthe Adjustment Center.\n(10) Rehabilitation programs00The inmates in the Adjustment Center and CCU are not provided\n97\naccess to vocational, educational, or work programs. No constitutional violations were found by\nthe Court with respect to this policy.\n(11) Fire protection00No constitutional violations were found.\n97\n(12) Personal hygiene00No constitutional violations were found, but the Court suggested to the\n97\ndefendant that he reevaluate the shower policy to allow if possible a shower on a more frequent\nbasis, but stopped short of ordering them to do so.\n(13) Dark cells00The use of dark cells was held not to be unconstitutional per se but the Court\n97\nmandated that a policy be developed and implemented setting forth the circumstances which\nwould trigger such confinement and the conditions of the confinement. The maximum period of\nsuch confinement could not, however, exceed twenty-four hours.\n(14) Strip searches00Routine strip searches without probable cause, of all inmates returning from\n97\nnon-contact visits was ordered to be immediately discontinued as violative of the Eighth\nAmendment.\nThe plaintiffs set forth two major procedural due process contentions with respect to the Adjustment Center\n(Segregation, Third Grade, and Second Grade). The first was that before an inmate can be transferred from\nSecond and Third Grade to Segregation, the inmate must be afforded a second (the first being the proceedings\nbefore the disciplinary board which resulted in confinement in the Adjustment Center initially) full-blown due\nprocess hearing because such transfers further limit the inmate's privileges. The defendant argued that transfers\nfrom one level in the Adjustment Center to another level constituted an intra-institution transfer and as such does\nnot require a due process hearing as long as the inmate's total time in the Adjustment Center does not exceed\nthe ninety (90) day maximum.\nThis Court held that the initial procedures for confining an inmate to the Adjustment Center fully complied with the\nrequirements of Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). No evidence was found\nto show that the defendant acted unreasonably or arbitrarily in effecting transfers from Third and Second Grade\nto Segregation as long as such transfers did not result in confinement beyond ninety (90) days for any one\n\noffense. The Court, in addition, found that conditions in all levels were essentially the same, although the\nprivileges afforded to inmates in the various levels was different. The Court was not willing in the absence of an\n453 unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of its discretion with respect *453 to meting out discipline and implementing\npenal programs to interfere with the defendant's day-to-day programming within the Adjustment Center.\nThe plaintiffs' second procedural due process contention was that indeterminate confinement in the Adjustment\nCenter without a meaningful review of their confinement based on objective criteria violated due process. The\nCourt held that the inmates so confined were not entitled to a full-blown due process hearing each time he comes\nup for review.\nThe preexisting policy of the defendant with respect to review of indeterminate sentences was a review by the\nClassification Review Board twenty days after the imposition of sentence and if confinement was continued then\nsuch confinement was reviewed every fifteen days until release. The inmate was not present at the review\nhearing nor did he receive a written report from the board indicating whether confinement was to continue, date\nof the next review, reasons for continued confinement, and what must be done to secure release. The Court held\nthat minimal due process requires that the inmates be given advance notice of the hearing date, opportunity to\nsubmit a written report, and if confinement is continued the reasons for continued confinement, what was\nexpected to obtain release, and the objective criteria to be applied at the next review hearing.\nThe defendant's original policy with respect to Close Custody II (CCU) (Administrative Segregation) was that the\nClassification Review Board would make such placements without notice or a hearing. During the trial the\ndefendant consented to change in the procedures employed by the Classification Review Board to provide\ninmates a formal due process hearing prior to placement in the CCU. The defendant contended that this change\nin policy with respect to due process to be followed in making placements in CCU was not constitutionally\nmandated.\nThe Court, based upon Wolff v. McDonald, supra, and Enomoto v. Wright, 462 F.Supp. 397 (N.D.Cal.1976),aff'd\n434 U.S. 1052, 98 S.Ct. 1223, 55 L.Ed.2d 756 (1978), found that the rules and regulations of the South Dakota\nPenitentiary created a justifiable expectation that an inmate could remain in the general prison population and not\nbe confined to CCU as long as he obeys the rules and regulations. The defendant having created this liberty\ninterest cannot arbitrarily take it away. The Classification Review Board, the Court held, must comply with\nminimum due process procedures (notice and hearing) before transferring an inmate from the general population\nto CCU. The Court further required the Classification Review Board to provide the inmates a list of the objective\ncriteria it applies in making such determinations and if confinement in CCU was to be continued, the inmate must\nbe provided with the reasons and the conduct required to obtain release as required by Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d\n394 (8th Cir.1975).\nThe plaintiffs' final claim was that Native Americans as a subclass were discriminated against in the disciplinary\nprocess in that they were sent more often to the Adjustment Center and spent longer time there than whites. In\nsupport of their equal protection claim the plaintiffs analyzed and presented data from inmate disciplinary files\nand produced computer printouts analyzing the statistics. The statistics presented by the plaintiffs were severely\nflawed since race was the only controlled variable used in the analysis. The Classification Review Board,\nhowever, considers a number of other factors in reaching a decision about disciplinary measures which were not\ncontrolled in the plaintiffs' analysis based only on race. The Court found that recidivism, not racism, accounted for\nthe sentencing disparities. The Court held that the plaintiffs had not produced sufficient evidence of a racially\ndisproportionate impact, hence failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. See Inmates of\nNebraska v. Greenholtz, 567 F.2d 1368 (8th Cir.1977),cert. denied439 U.S. 841, 99 S.Ct. 132, 58 L.Ed.2d 140\n(1978).\n454 Judgment was filed by the Court on February 18, 1983, consistent with the memorandum *454 decision and\norder. The judgment entered by the Court reflected post-trial changes made by the defendant in response to the\nmemorandum decision and order. The judgment sets out a policy with respect to such areas as lighting, trash\ncollection, recreation, showers, access to law library, strip searches upon return from noncontact visits\ndiscontinued, except for reasonable suspicion of contraband or other prohibited items, and review of confinement\nof CCU inmates. The above changes in policy were incorporated into the Living Guide and Regulation of the\nSouth Dakota State Penitentiary.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys have separately moved or applied to the Court for an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. section 1988. Plaintiffs requested an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988 based\non the following lodestar (reasonable hours times reasonable rate) calculations:\nName of           No. of In-Court    No. of Out-Of-\nCourt    Travel    Hourly       Subtotal\nAttorney/         Hours                 Hours                Time      Rate\nParalegal\nChristopher\nD.

Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).\nI. Plaintiffs As Prevailing Parties\nIn order to recover attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988 plaintiffs must satisfy the threshold\nrequirement of being a \"prevailing party.\" In Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, the Supreme Court stated:\nThe standard for making this threshold determination has been framed in various ways. A typical\nformulation is that \"plaintiffs may be considered `prevailing parties' for attorney's fees purposes if\nthey succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties\nsought in bringing the suit.\" Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (C.A. 1 1978). (footnotes\nomitted)\nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals applied this standard in Fast v. The School District of City of Ladue, 712 F.2d\n379, 380 (8th Cir.1983). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals formulated its own standard for making this threshold\ndetermination prior to the decision in Hensley. In Reel v. Arkansas Department of Corrections, 672 F.2d 693 (8th\nCir.1982), the court stated that \"(a) plaintiff qualifies as a prevailing party once he has been successful on a\nsingle substantial claim brought in the context of a civil rights suit; success on all claims made is not required.\" Id.\nat 697, citing Busche v. Burkee, 649 F.2d 509, 521 (7th Cir.),cert. denied454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70\nL.Ed.2d 212 (1981). The court in Reel further stated that \"(i)t is sufficient if a significant issue is determined in the\nplaintiff's favor and leads to the achievement of some of the benefits sought by bringing suit.\" Id. at 697, citing \n455 Oldham*455v. Ehrlich, 617 F.2d 163, 168, n. 9 (8th Cir.1980); Bonnes v. Long, 599 F.2d 1316 (4th Cir.1979); \nNadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275 (1st Cir.1978). A court may also look to the \"substance of the litigation's\noutcome\" to determine if the plaintiff substantially prevailed. Reel v. Arkansas Department of Corrections, supra,\n\nciting Ross v. Horn, 598 F.2d 1312 (3rd Cir.1979),cert. denied448 U.S. 906, 100 S.Ct. 3048, 65 L.Ed.2d 1136\n(1980). See also Charles v. Coleman, 689 F.2d 774, 776 (8th Cir. 1982).\nThe fact that plaintiffs did not prevail on all the theories alleged in the complaint and did not obtain all desired\nrelief does not preclude an award of attorney's fees if plaintiffs succeeded on a single substantial civil rights\nclaim. United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, 622 F.2d 342, 348 (8th Cir.1980); Oldham v. Ehrlich, supra at\n168 f.n. 9; Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d at 50; Reel v. Arkansas\nDepartment of Corrections, supra at 697; Fast v. The School District of City of Ladue, supra at 380.\nA lawsuit which does not directly result in the relief sought but prompts or catalyzes the defendant to act may\nqualify the plaintiffs for an attorney's fee award. United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, supra at 346 f.n. 5; \nInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Andersen, 569 F.2d 1027 (8th Cir.1978); Parham v.\nSouthwestern Bell Telephone Co., 433 F.2d 421 (8th Cir.1970). The First Circuit Court of Appeals in Nadeau v.\nHelgemoe, supra, established a two-fold test for determining who was the prevailing party in a case which has\nbeen settled. This test was adopted by the Eighth Circuit in United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, supra at\n346. This analysis applies equally to the question of a plaintiff's entitlement to attorney's fees where the\nprocedures challenged have been changed subsequent to the filing of the plaintiff's lawsuit, but no formal\njudgment or settlement decree mandates such changes. See e.g. Ross v. Horn, 598 F.2d 1312, 1314 (3rd\nCir.1979),cert. denied448 U.S. 906, 100 S.Ct. 3048, 65 L.Ed.2d 1136 (1980); Institutionalized Juveniles v.\nSecretary of Public Welfare, 568 F.Supp. 1020 (E.D.Pa. 1983).\nThe first part of the Nadeau two-part test presents a factual question. This test requires that \"... plaintiff's suit and\ntheir attorney's efforts ... (be) a necessary and important factor in achieving the improvements ...\" Nadeau v.\nHelgemoe at 281. The factual test essentially requires a causal relationship between the plaintiff's lawsuit and the\nbeneficial changes implemented by the defendant. Gurule v. Wilson, 635 F.2d 782, 791-2 (10th Cir.1980). It is\nnot, however, necessary for the plaintiff's lawsuit to be the sole cause or even the primary cause of the changes. \nUnited Handicapped Federation v. Andre, supra at 346. If the plaintiffs' lawsuit here served as a catalyst for\nchanges in the defendant's past practices and such changes provided some of the relief initially sought such\nchanges are properly considered by the Court in analyzing whether the plaintiffs were the prevailing party\nassuming satisfaction of the second part of the Nadeau test.\nThe second part of the Nadeau test presents a legal question involving a determination of whether defendant's\nconduct in making the changes or reforms beneficial to the plaintiffs was legally required or merely gratuitous. \nNadeau at 281. If the defendant's actions were made gratuitously or voluntarily, the plaintiffs did not legally\nprevail and the second part of the Nadeau test goes unsatisfied. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals defined this\ntest as \"... whether defendant's conduct can be viewed as `gratuitous,' that is, whether plaintiff's lawsuit was\n`frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless,'\" United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, supra at 347.\nPlaintiffs contended that they were obviously a \"prevailing party\" although they did not prevail on all of the claims.\nThe plaintiffs base this contention upon their success with respect to obtaining beneficial changes in disciplinary\n456 and classification *456 procedures in relation to the Adjustment Center and CCU and in obtaining specific\nchanges in living conditions and entitlements in the Adjustment Center and CCU. The defendant, however, takes\nissue with the plaintiffs' contentions. The defendant accurately points out that the plaintiffs enjoyed no success on\ntheir equal protection (race discrimination) claims nor on their overall claim that the conditions in the Adjustment\nCenter violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The defendant\ncontended that plaintiffs achieved only full or partial limited success in only a few of the areas in which changes\nwere sought. The defendant characterized these changes as minor adjustments or simply a fine tuning of existing\ncircumstances.\nThe Court finds that the plaintiffs are a \"prevailing party\" and entitled to an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. section 1988. The defendant understates the degree of success that plaintiffs attained in the litigation,\nparticularly as it relates to the due process issues. In resolving the question whether the plaintiffs are the\nprevailing party, the Court must view the litigation as a whole and not just balance the plaintiffs' wins against their\nlosses. Reel v. Arkansas Department of Correction, supra at 697; Charles v. Coleman, supra at 776; Gurule v.\nWilson, 635 F.2d 782, 791 (10th Cir.1980). In viewing the litigation as a whole the plaintiffs here have succeeded\non \"significant or substantial issues\" which success provided at least some of the relief sought by the litigation. \n\nSee Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra; Reel v. Arkansas Department of Correction, supra. Without considering the\nplaintiffs' limited success on the overall Eighth Amendment claims and the challenges to specific conditions, the\nplaintiffs did obtain meaningful changes in the procedural due process area.\nSubstantial changes in policy were prompted or catalyzed by the litigation with respect to the procedures that the\nClassification Review Board must comply with in making the initial placements from the general prison population\nto CCU. The causal connection between the litigation and the changes cannot be disputed, satisfying the first\npart of the Nadeau test. Prior to the change in procedures by the defendant the Classification Review Board\nwould make such placements without notice or a hearing. During the course of the trial the defendant changed\nthe procedures to provide the inmates a formal due process hearing prior to placement in the CCU. The Court in\nissuing its memorandum decision and order and judgment assumed that this change of procedure was\nimplemented by the defendant. The defendant contended that this change was gratuitous and not legally\nmandated. This Court, however, found that the preexisting rules and regulations of the penitentiary created a\njustifiable expectation that an inmate could remain in the general prison population as long as he obeys the rules\nwhich liberty interest could not be taken away without affording the inmates due process. See Meachum v. Fano,\n427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976); Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49\nL.Ed.2d 466 (1976); Richardson v. Lokey, 427 U.S. 902, 96 S.Ct. 3186, 49 L.Ed.2d 1196 (1976); Gurule v.\nWilson, supra. The defendant's action in changing the procedure without court order was not gratuitous, but\nconstitutionally required, therefore an improvement attributable to plaintiffs' litigation. The second part of the \nNadeau test is also satisfied so these changes are properly considered in this determination. This change by\nitself was clearly significant.\nThe plaintiffs also obtained a change in the review process for those confined in the Adjustment Center. This\nchange provided that if confinement was continued after review, the inmate must be notified of the reasons for\ncontinued confinement, what was expected of the inmate to obtain release, and the objective criteria that was to\nbe applied at the next review. (This change was not, however, included in the judgment itself). In addition, those\ninmates confined to CCU will have their cases reviewed by the Classification Review Board at least every ninety\n457 (90) days. *457 If such confinement is to continue, then the inmate must be provided specific written reasons why\nsuch confinement will continue, notice before the hearing, opportunity to be present at such hearing and present\na statement or documentary evidence, and those unable to prepare their own cases may be represented by their\nassigned correctional counsellors.\nA further change in policy, prompted by the litigation to the benefit of the plaintiff class but not specifically noted in\nthe judgment of the court, was to establish a written policy with respect to the maximum period of confinement in\nsegregation. The first part of the Nadeau test is again satisfied without any dispute. Prior to the adoption of Policy\nStatement 3.26 of Living Guide and Regulation of the South Dakota Penitentiary there was no established policy\nas to the maximum time that may be spent in segregation per offense. During the course of trial, the defendant\nproposed and adopted Policy Statement 3.26 which limited the period of confinement in segregation to a\nmaximum of thirty (30) days per offense. Based upon this change the Court denied plaintiffs' motion for a\npreliminary injunction and mooted any question about this practice during the trial. The defendant cannot\nreasonably conclude that this change was gratuitous based upon the mandate in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678,\n98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978). This change in policy satisfied both parts of the Nadeau test and properly\nconsidered by the Court in this determination. This change, while it may seem miniscule to the defendant, is not\ninsignificant to those presently or in the future confined to segregation. This change also obtained for the plaintiff\nclass some of the relief sought by the litigation.\nAlthough the Court did not find any constitutional violations with respect to the living conditions in the Adjustment\nCenter, it did recommend changes in certain conditions or policies to the defendant and in some cases mandated\nsuch changes. The changes which the defendant submitted to the Court in response to the Court's memorandum\ndecision and order were incorporated in the judgment of the Court. These changes resulted in improvements in\nthe living conditions of those inmates confined to the Adjustment Center, albeit minimal in scope. These\nimprovements involved the following areas:\n(1) established regulations and restrictions on the use of dark cells;\n(2) clarifies that psychiatric care must be provided when needed;\n\n(3) individual choice as to amount of wattage in light bulbs in each cell up to 100 watts;\n(4) clarifies the furnishings that must be provided in each cell and the basis for their removal;\n(5) daily trash collection;\n(6) increased frequency of recreational opportunities in Second Grade, Third Grade and CCU and nature of such\nopportunities;\n(7) increased frequency of showers;\n(8) increased access to law books and established procedures for administering the policy;\n(9) strip searches upon return from noncontact visits were discontinued.\nThe conditions of confinement in the Adjustment Center and CCU following the Court's judgment are now\ngoverned by written policies and guidelines whereas before they were largely informal unstated policy matters.\nThis change improved the conditions to some extent of the plaintiff class and obtains some of the relief sought by\nthe litigation. The plaintiffs' litigation clearly catalyzed these improvements as a question of fact, but these\nchanges with a few exceptions were not mandated by either the Constitution or the Court's memorandum\ndecision and order, but were largely gratuitous. Plaintiffs having significantly succeeded in their procedural due\nprocess claims therefore makes it unnecessary for the Court to determine whether plaintiffs' success as to\nindividual living conditions would by itself establish the plaintiffs as a prevailing party. Viewing the litigation as a\n458 whole and the results *458 obtained, the plaintiffs have \"prevailed\" within the context of 42 U.S.C. section 1988.\nII. Determining a Reasonable Fee\nAttorney's fees are routinely awarded to a prevailing plaintiff unless \"special circumstances\" render such an\naward unjust. Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968); \nJohnson v. Nordstrom-Larpenteur Agency, Inc., 623 F.2d 1279, 1282 (8th Cir.),cert. denied449 U.S. 1042, 101\nS.Ct. 622, 66 L.Ed.2d 504 (1980); United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, 622 F.2d 342 (8th Cir.1980); Green\nv. Ten Eyck, 572 F.2d 1233, 1243 (8th Cir.1978); Walker v. Wegner, 535 F.Supp. 415 (D.S.D.1982). The Court\ndoes not find that special circumstances exist here which would make an award of attorneys' fees unjust.\nHaving concluded that the plaintiffs are a prevailing party, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988, and that no\n\"special circumstances\" exist, the next step is to determine the amount of a reasonable fee. \"(T)he most useful\nstarting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the\nlitigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1939,\n76 L.Ed.2d at 50. See also Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust, 643 F.2d 1305, 1312 (8th Cir. 1981). This calculation,\nhowever, provides only an objective basis upon which to make an initial estimate of the fee award and is not itself\nconclusive. Id.\nPrevailing plaintiffs are not entitled to compensation for those hours claimed that were not \"reasonably\nexpended.\" Id. The district courts are vested with the discretion to evaluate the number of hours claimed and to\nreduce the number of hours to the extent appropriate under the circumstances. Ladies Center, Nebraska, Inc. v.\nThone, 645 F.2d 645, 647 (8th Cir.1981); Hinkle v. Christensen, 548 F.Supp. 630, 632 (D.S.D.1982). The district\ncourt may reduce the number of hours claimed if they are found to be duplicative or excessive. Jaquette v. Black\nHawk County, Iowa, 710 F.2d 455, 457 (8th Cir. 1983). The United States Supreme Court in Hensley stated that\n\"counsel for the prevailing party should make a good faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are\nexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary ...\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra at ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. at\n1939-40, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51; See also, Ass'n for Retarded Citizens of N.D. v. Olson, 713 F.2d 1384, 1395 (8th\nCir.1983).\nPlaintiffs' counsel (excluding Kemp, the paralegal) requested an attorneys' fee award based upon 586.5 total\nhours. Defendant in response to plaintiffs' request submitted a chart which divided the hours claimed into various\ntypes of activities. Addressing only the hours claimed by the attorneys, the defendant presented eight categories\n\nof activities which were identified by the letters A through G. The activities encompassed by Type A through G are\nall tasks which would normally be billed to a private-fee-paying client in the exercise of billing judgment. Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, supra, citing Copeland v. Marshall, 205 U.S.App.D.C. 390, 401, 641 F.2d 880, 891 (1980) (en banc).\nSee also, Ramos v. Lamm, 713 F.2d 546, 553 (10th Cir.1983).\nConcluding that the tasks performed are compensable or properly billable does not complete the Court's inquiry\nsince the time actually expended does not mean that such time was reasonably expended in terms of the amount\nof time expended on each task. The Tenth Circuit in Ramos v. Lamm, 713 F.2d 546 (10th Cir.1983), stated that\nthe hours reported for each task that are properly billable should also be evaluated by the district court in order to\ndetermine whether the time spent was reasonable in light of the complexity of the case, the number of\nreasonable strategies pursued, and the responses necessitated by the actions of the other side. Id. at 554. The\npotential duplication of services, especially when multiple attorneys are involved, must also be considered in this\ndetermination. Id.\n459 *459 Plaintiffs claimed for Type A activity, which involved meetings with clients and witnesses, a total of 88.5\nhours,00Gilbert 28.5 hours; Stanley 20 hours; and Cummings 40 hours. The defendant recommended\n97\napproximately 22.5 hours for these activities (Type A) objecting primarily because the hours claimed were\nundocumented, excessive, and duplicative. The issues raised by the defendant concerning the specificity and\ndocumentation of the fee claims are addressed later as a separate issue.\nConsidering the nature of this case, a total of 88.5 hours to meet with witnesses and clients is excessive. This\ncase did not turn upon the individual experiences of any one of the inmates, but primarily upon the regulations\nand policies of the defendant governing the conditions and procedures in the Adjustment Center as it affected the\nplaintiff class. These regulations and policies could have been obtained more efficiently and effectively by other\nmeans. Time spent by counsel listening to inmates' complaints about conditions was not reasonably expended\nnor was such time necessary to effectively litigate the issues in this case. In addition, it did not require three\nattorneys to interview the clients or witnesses. This expenditure of time was essentially duplicative. The Court\nfinds that a reasonable number of hours for Type A activity was 60 hours. This reduction shall be apportioned\nbetween the three attorneys in the following manner:\n              No. of Hours      No. of Hours Determined\n             Claimed Type A        to be Reasonable\nGilbert          28.5                  19.0\nStanley          20.0                  10.5\nCummings         40.0                  30.5\n                 ________________________________\n                 88.5 hours            60.0 hours\nType B activity involved meetings and conferences with co-counsel. The plaintiffs' counsel claimed a total of\n102.5 hours for meetings among themselves. Gilbert claimed 42 hours, Stanley claimed 34 hours, and\nCummings claimed 26.5 hours for Type B activities. The defendant recommended 36.5 hours for Type B activity.\nThe defendant challenged the need for all three lawyers to sit down together and discuss the case, the conflicts\nin the dates, and amounts of time claimed. The defendant suggested that the lead attorney should have met with\neach of the lawyers and delegated responsibilities rather than tying up three lawyers at one time with all aspects\nof the case. Approximately half of the hours claimed for this activity involved night meetings following the trial\ndays.\nThe Court acknowledges the necessity for meeting among counsel to discuss case strategy and other aspects of\nthe case, but questions the reasonableness of 102.5 hours for such meetings involving all three lawyers. A better\npractice would have been for plaintiffs to designate lead counsel for particular aspects of the case and for that\nlawyer to delegate responsibilities to each of the others to minimize duplication of effort and obviate the need for\nall three lawyers to meet with each other at the same time. Although the total number of hours claimed\nconsidering that three lawyers were involved representing the same plaintiffs are not excessive, it is duplicative\nand redundant. The Court finds that 75.5 hours represents a reasonable number of hours after reducing the\n\nhours claimed that are considered duplicative and redundant. This reduction shall be apportioned between the\nthree attorneys as follows:\n                 No. of Hours      No. of Hours Determined\n                Claimed Type B        to be Reasonable\nGilbert             42.0                  33.0\nStanley             34.0                  25.0\nCummings            26.5                  17.5\n                   _________________________________\n                   102.5 hours            75.5 hours\nType C activity involved drafting of pleadings and letters, research, reading transcripts, and general trial\npreparation. Gilbert claimed 18.5 hours, Stanley 114 hours, and Cummings 23.5 hours for Type C activity for a\ntotal of 156 hours. The defendant recommended a total of 62 hours objecting on the grounds that hours claimed\nwere excessive, duplicative, and undocumented. The Court does not find that number of hours claimed by the\nplaintiffs for Type C activity to be unreasonable.\n460 Type D activity included hearings and actual in-court time for trial of the litigation. *460 Plaintiffs' counsel\nrespectively claimed the following number of hours for Type D activity00Gilbert 48 hours; Stanley 52 hours; and\n97\nCummings 50 hours for a total of 150 hours. The defendant recommended reducing the number of hours claimed\nfor Type D activity to 94 hours contending that some of the hearings local counsel could have handled and that\nrepresentation by three lawyers at trial was one too many. Defendant recommended deletion of the hours\nclaimed for the prison tour due to a discrepancy in the dates in the fee application.\nThe trial in this action started on June 3, 1980, and continued through June 6, 1980. The trial recessed until\nDecember 8, 1980, and then continued through December 11, 1980, for a total of eight days of trial. Assuming six\nhours for each day of trial a total of forty-eight (48) hours was expended for each attorney for an aggregate of 144\nhours. The other hours claimed under Type D relate to motion hearings, depositions, and the prison tour.\nAttendance of three attorneys at the pretrial hearing held on May 22, 1979, was unnecessary and resulted in\nduplication of work effort, particularly since the motion for a preliminary injunction was not being pursued at that\ntime. This task could and should have reasonably been handled by one lawyer so the hours claimed for this\nhearing will be reduced by twenty (20) hours. The Court rejects the defendant's recommendation that the hours\nclaimed for the prison tour be deleted. The Court does, however, agree with the defendant's contention that three\nlawyers to handle a court trial of this nature (126 hours) was excessive and resulted in unnecessary duplication of\neffort so the number of hours claimed for in-court time will be reduced by forty-two (42.0) hours. The addition of a\nsecond chair for trial invites careful scrutiny by the Court for possible duplication of effort. Hinkle v. Christensen,\n548 F.Supp. 630, 633 (D.S. D.1982); Walker v. Wegner, 535 F.Supp. 415, 418 (D.S.D.1982) (quoting Johnson v.\nGeorgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir.1974). The plaintiffs have not sustained their burden\nof proof that three lawyers were necessary to try this case. See Hinkle v. Christensen, supra at 633. The Court\nfinds that for Type D activity that 106 hours was a reasonable number of hours and apportions these hours\nbetween plaintiffs' counsel as follows:\n              No. of Hours      No. of Hours Determined\n             Claimed Type D        to be Reasonable\nGilbert          48.0                  33.34\nStanley          52.0                  37.34\nCummings         50.0                  35.34\n                __________________________________\n                150.0 hours           106.02 hours\nType E activity involved Gilbert's contacting of Jay Kaplan with the National Center for Correctional Mediation in\nNew York City. The defendant refused to participate in the proposed mediation process. Attorney Gilbert claimed\n\nfour and one-half (4.5) hours for his visit with Jay Kaplan and one hour for a telephone conversation. The\ndefendant contended that these hours should not be compensated since they were not incurred with his\napproval, encouragement or knowledge. The Court rejects the defendant's argument but regards the plaintiffs'\nattempt to obtain mediation of the dispute as ancillary to the civil rights litigation upon which an award of\nattorneys' fees can be based. This ancillary activity lies outside the context of the civil rights action filed with the\ndistrict court and as such is not compensable under 42 U.S.C. section 1988. The awarding of attorneys' fees for\nother related proceedings rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. Brown v. Bathke, 588 F.2d 634, 638 (8th\nCir.1978). This activity cannot reasonably be considered settlement discussions since the defendant was not a\nparty to the activity. The Court finds that none of the claimed hours for Type E activity are compensable so\nreduces the hours claimed by Gilbert by five and one-half (5.5) hours.\nType F activity involved time spent by counsel in traveling from Cleveland, Ohio, to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for\nmeetings, hearings, and trial. Plaintiffs' counsel00 Gilbert and Stanley00claimed a total of eighty (80.0) hours for\n97 97\n461 travel (Type F). Gilbert claimed 32 hours00(four trips at 8 hours each) and Stanley claimed 48 hours *461 (6 trips\n97\nat 8 hours each). The defendant, however, contended that the bulk of this travel was unnecessary because local\ncounsel, Cummings, could have handled the matters. Those trips the defendant conceded were necessary he\ncontended should be compensated as costs at $350.00 per trip in lieu of compensation. The Court is unwilling to\nconclude that all the trips to Sioux Falls were unnecessary nor is it willing to compensate this time on the basis of\ncosts alone as recommended by the defendant. The Court does, however, find that in the exercise of billing\njudgment counsel would not bill a private client for 80.0 hours of travel time, particularly at the same rate as for\nother legal tasks. The Court further finds that a reasonable number of hours would be 60 hours for Type F activity.\nThis reduction shall be apportioned equally between Gilbert and Stanley.\nType G activity involved the time expended by plaintiffs' counsel preparing their fee request. Stanley is the only\nattorney submitting time for Type G activity. Stanley claims 4.0 hours for this activity. Defendant recommended\nthat none of these hours should be compensated. Counsel for prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to compensation for\ntime reasonably spent in preparing and establishing attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988. Jorstad v.\nI.D.S. Realty Trust, supra at 1314; Jones v. MacMillan Bloedel Containers, Inc., 685 F.2d 236, 239 (8th Cir.1982); \nSee also, Gagne v. Maher, 594 F.2d 336, 344 (2nd Cir.1979),aff'd on other grounds,448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct.\n2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980); New York Ass'n for Retarded Children v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1148 (2nd\nCir.1983). The Court finds that the four (4.0) hours claimed by Stanley were reasonably expended.\nIn summary the Court finds that 461.52 hours represents a reasonable number of hours for the litigation of this\ncase which hours are apportioned among the three attorneys in the following manner:\n            No. of Hours\nGilbert          125.84\nStanley          228.84\nCummings         106.84\n                 ______\n                 461.52 hours\nThe other half of the lodestar equation for computing the amount of a reasonable attorney fee is a reasonable\nhourly rate. Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra. As with the number of hours claimed the district court is vested with the\ndiscretion to evaluate the hourly rate charged and reduce the rate if appropriate. Ladies Center Nebraska, Inc. v.\nThone, supra at 647. The Eighth Circuit has held that \"it is particularly important that these rates which are\napplied be, in fact, reasonable hourly rates.\" Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust, 643 F.2d 1305, 1312 (8th Cir.1981); \nSee also, Avalon Cinema Corp. v. Thompson, 689 F.2d 137, 140 (8th Cir.1982); Jaquette v. Black Hawk County,\nIowa, supra at 459.\nA reasonable rate for compensating attorneys in civil rights cases should be commensurate with the reasonable\ncharges of a private attorney in private litigation. Jaquette v. Black Hawk County, Iowa, supra at 459. In addition,\nit has been held that \"(i)n general, a reasonable hourly rate would be the ordinary fee `for similar work in the\ncommunity,'\" Avalon Cinema Corp. v. Thompson, supra at 140 (quoting Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express,\n\nInc., 488 F.2d 714, 718 (5th Cir.1974)). This definition was further refined in Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust, supra\nat 1313 in which the court stated that \"(t)he term `reasonable hourly rate' ... (was the) `hourly amount to which\nattorneys of like skill in the area would typically be entitled for a given type of work on the basis of an hourly rate\nof compensation.'\" Id. (quoting City of Detroit v. Grinnell, 495 F.2d 448, 471 (2nd Cir.1974) (Grinnell I)).\nThe courts are not bound to mechanically accept as conclusive counsel's regular charges as the reasonable\nhourly rate. Avalon Cinema Corp. v. Thompson, supra at 140. The Eighth Circuit has stated that courts have a\nduty to fix a fee that is reasonable which does not mean automatic acceptance of a lawyer's customary charge. \n462 Id. To do otherwise \"... would *462 be an abdication of ... (court's) duty to supervise the conduct of the bar and do\njustice to the losing as well as the winning side.\" Id. See also, Jaquette v. Black Hawk County, Iowa, supra at 458.\nA lawyer's customary rate may, however, be relevant to the determination of a reasonable hourly rate but would\nnot be conclusive. Ramos v. Lamm, 713 F.2d 546, 555 (10th Cir.1983).\nPlaintiffs' counsel contended that the following rates represent reasonable hourly rates:\nGilbert        $125.00 per hour\nStanley        $125.00 per hour\nCummings       $ 40.00 in-court per hour\n               $ 30.00 out-of-court per hour\nGilbert in his affidavit claimed that a rate of $125.00 per hour was justified by his experience as a trial lawyer in\ncomplex litigation. Stanley in his affidavit claimed that his experience, particularly in prison litigation justified a\nrate of $125.00 per hour. The rates claimed by Gilbert and Stanley are not differentiated between in-court and\nout-of-court time. Cummings claimed a rate of $40.00 for in-court time and $30.00 for out-of-court time citing that\nthis case was his first federal court case and civil rights case. Gilbert and Stanley made no attempt to establish\nthat a rate of $125.00 would be the ordinary rate charged by lawyers of like skill in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for\nsimilar work. Gilbert and Stanley instead relied on what might be their customary charge or the ordinary rate for\nsuch services in Cleveland, Ohio. Counsel's customary charges are not binding upon this court. Avalon Cinema\nCorp. v. Thompson, supra. The definition of \"reasonable hourly rate\" established by the Eighth Circuit Court of\nAppeals requires that the rate be based upon the ordinary rate for the area in which the case is tried, not the\norigin of plaintiffs' counsel. Id.; Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust, supra at 1313. In Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust,\nsupra, the plaintiff requested compensation based upon $125.00 per hour for senior attorneys and $60.00 for\nassociates and the district court awarded attorneys' fees based upon these rates relying upon national standards.\nThe Eighth Circuit, however, held that the application of national standards constituted an abuse of discretion and\nset the hourly rates at $80.00 for senior attorneys and $40.00 for associates. Id. Out-of-town counsel are not,\nhowever, limited to the prevailing rate in the district if they can show that they have been unable through diligent,\ngood faith efforts to retain local counsel. Avalon Cinema Corp. v. Thompson, supra (citing Donaldson v.\nO'Connor, 454 F.Supp. 311, 315 (N.D.Fla. 1978). The plaintiffs here have failed to show any efforts to obtain local\ncounsel so will be held to the customary fee for the area in which the trial was held. This was not the kind of case\nthat members of the South Dakota and Sioux Falls bar would have been unable or unwilling to undertake.\nIn lieu of granting interest or increasing the amount for inflation the prevailing rate for 1983 will be applied to all\nthe hours claimed instead of a historical rate. The Tenth Circuit in Ramos v. Lamm, supra at 555, stated that\n\"(t)he hourly rate at which compensation is awarded should reflect rates in effect at the time the fee is being\nestablished by the court, rather than those in effect at the time the services were performed.\" This approach\nroughly approximates periodic adjustments for inflation and interest. Id.\nThe Court finds that a reasonable hourly rate for the services performed by Gilbert and Stanley in this litigation,\nbased upon the prevailing rate in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for lawyers of like skill and competence performing\nsimilar services, is $75.00 per hour for in-court time and $60.00 per hour for out-of-court time. The Court accepts\nCummings' claimed rate of $40.00 for in-court and $30.00 for out-of-court time.\nMultiplying these reasonable hourly rates by the reasonable number of hours previously determined yields the\nfollowing lodestar for each of the attorneys:\n\n              In-Court      Hourly Rate        Lodestar\n               Hours\nGilbert        33.34          $75.00          $2,500.50\nStanley        37.34           75.00           2,800.50\nCummings       35.34           40.00           1,413.60\n              _________________________________________\n              106.02 hours                    $6,714.60\n463 *463\n           Out-of-Court     Hourly Rate       Lodestar\n              Hours\nGilbert        92.5           $60.00         $ 5,550.00\nStanley       191.5            60.00          11,490.00\nCummings       71.5            30.00           2,145.00\n              _________________________________________\n              355.5 hours                    $19,185.00\n                               TOTAL         $25,899.60\nThe above analysis also applies to computing the lodestar or base fee for the efforts of Kemp, the paralegal\nemployed by Cummings to assist in this litigation. The application for fees submitted by Cummings includes\n409.5 hours of effort expended by Kemp. These hours are divided between compilation of statistics (185 hours)\nand all other hours (224.5 hours). A rate of $15.00 per hour was multiplied times the 409.5 hours to arrive at a\nproposed lodestar of $6,142.50. The defendant recommended a total of 9.5 hours times a rate of $5.00 per hour\nfor a lodestar of $47.50. The defendant argued that Kemp's claimed hours were excessive, undocumented,\nunnecessary, pro bono, and educational.\nThe Court agrees with the defendant that the number of hours expended by Kemp were excessive given the\nscope, nature, and complexity of this case, particularly as it relates to sessions with plaintiffs and other\nunspecified witnesses and Kemp's limited role in the litigation. In addition, it appears that Kemp also spent an\nunnecessary amount of time on legal research not relevant to the case. The Court is not at this point addressing\nitself to the lack of documentation present in Kemp's application, but will address this problem later. The Court\nfinds 230 hours to be a reasonable number of hours for the tasks performed by Kemp. The proposed rate of\n$15.00 per hour is also too high for similar services in the area. The Court finds that a reasonable hourly rate is\n$10.00 per hour. The lodestar for Kemp's services is $2,300.00 (230 hours × $10.00 per hour).\nThe establishment of a lodestar or base fee does not end the Court's inquiry in determining a reasonable fee.\nThe lodestar of $28,199.60 provided only an initial estimate or starting point in establishing a fee award. Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d at 50; Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust, supra at\n1312. A lodestar may be adjusted upward by the court based on the contingent nature of success or the quality of\nthe attorney's work. Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust, supra at 1312-13, (citing Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American\nRadiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F.2d 161, 167-68 (3rd Cir.1973); Merola v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 493\nF.2d 292, 297 (3rd Cir.1974); See also, Grunin v. International House of Pancakes, 513 F.2d 114 (8th Cir.),cert.\ndenied423 U.S. 864, 96 S.Ct. 124, 46 L.Ed.2d 93 (1975). In addition, the twelve Johnson v. Georgia Highway\nExpress, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), factors also provide guidelines to be used by a court to enhance the\nlodestar.\nPlaintiffs suggested in their fee applications (Gilbert and Stanley) that a multiplier or bonus factor should be\napplied to the lodestar for the quality, risk, complexity, and because work on this case precluded work for other\nclients. The defendant, on the other hand, argued that enhancement was not justified in this case. A moving party\nbears a heavy burden in establishing entitlement to an increase in the lodestar for risk and quality. Jorstad v.\nI.D.S. Realty Trust, supra at 1314\n\n. Increasing of the lodestar to adjust for the quality of counsel's work is designed to reward an unusual or\nextraordinary degree of skill. The Court finds that under the circumstances in this case that enhancement of the\nlodestar is not justified. Although counsel for the plaintiffs purported to have exhibited extraordinary skill in\nhandling this case, the level of skill shown has been compensated in the \"reasonable hourly rate\" established by\nthe Court. This case was not so complex and unusual that it required special skills to litigate the questions\ninvolved. The risk or contingency involved in this case was also not out of the ordinary so as to justify an\nenhancement of the lodestar.\n464 If a plaintiff in a civil rights case does not prevail on all claims unrelated to *464 those upon which he succeeds,\nthey are not entitled to compensation for time expended on these unrelated unsuccessful claims. Hensley v.\nEckerhart, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51. The results or success obtained was\ncited by the Supreme Court in Hensley as an important factor to be considered by the district court in determining\na reasonable fee. Id.\nThe Eighth Circuit had stated prior to the decision in Hensley that plaintiff's success was a factor that could be\nconsidered in determining reasonable attorneys' fees. Johnson v. Nordstrom-Larpenteur Agency, Inc., 623 F.2d\n1279 (8th Cir.),cert. denied449 U.S. 1042, 101 S.Ct. 622, 66 L.Ed.2d 504 (1980); In re Southwestern Bell Tel.\nCo. Maternity Benefits Litigation v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 602 F.2d 845, 850 f.n. 9 (8th Cir.1979); \nBrown v. Bathke, 588 F.2d 634, 637 (8th Cir.1978). Hensley emphasized that the relationship between the extent\nof success and the amount of fee award may justify an adjustment of the lodestar. Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra,\n___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51. Hensley also established that a plaintiff may be compensated\nfor time expended on unsuccessful claims that are related to the successful claims. Id. The emphasis that may be\nplaced on the degree of success under Hensley exceeded that previously authorized in the Eighth Circuit. See \nBrown v. Bathke, supra.\nPlaintiffs asserted that their complaint presented interrelated legal theories which precluded an adjustment based\nupon the success obtained pursuant to Hensley. The plaintiffs essentially urged that all the claims made were\n\"related\" hence under Hensley they may be compensated for all their time although unsuccessful on some of\ntheir claims. The defendant, however, argued that the principles enunciated in Hensley demanded a large\nreduction in the lodestar.\nHensley requires an initial determination as to whether the plaintiffs failed to prevail on claims unrelated to the\nsuccessful claims. The plaintiffs presented three major theories of relief to the Court in this litigation. These\ntheories were (1) conditions of confinement in the Adjustment Center violated the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments; (2) procedures governing placement and continued detention in the Adjustment Center and the\nCCU violated Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments due process; and (3) racial discrimination in the placement and\ncontinued confinement in the Adjustment Center. The plaintiffs asserted that these three claims are related claims\nand not severable from each other.\nThe three theories of relief set forth by the plaintiffs were not based upon a common core of facts, nor were they\nrelated legal theories in the sense of warranty and tort claims in products liability cases. Id. The theories\npresented were not alternate theories to but one end but instead would each achieve a different type of relief.\nThe litigation can theoretically be viewed as a series of discrete claims. Id. The plaintiffs, however, by the nature\nof their fee application effectively precluded analysis of the time expended on each of these discrete claims.\nThe plaintiffs did not prevail to any extent on their racial discrimination claim and obtained only limited success on\ntheir other claims. No Eighth Amendment violations were found in the overall conditions in the Adjustment Center\nand only minor problems were found with respect to individual living conditions in the Adjustment Center. The\nproblems identified for the most part were not problems of constitutional proportion. The plaintiffs also did not\ncompletely succeed on all their due process allegations, but were only moderately successful.\nThe plaintiffs' fee application did not differentiate, with some exceptions, between legal theories in terms of\ndocumenting the time expended. This forces the Court to view the plaintiffs' application as a single interrelated\nclaim and not as discrete claims. The Supreme Court in Hensley directed that in those instances where counsel's\n465 time is devoted to the litigation as a whole making it difficult to divide the *465 hours expended on a claim-by-\nclaim basis the court \"should focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained ... in relation to the hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation.\" Id. The Supreme Court further stated that \"(w)here a plaintiff has obtained\nexcellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee.\" Id. This would normally encompass all\nhours reasonably expended. Id. The Court does not find the results achieved in this litigation to be so excellent to\njustify ignoring the degree of success as a factor in determining a reasonable fee.\n\"If the plaintiff has achieved `only partial or limited success' then even though the plaintiff's claims were\n`interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith,' an award determined by multiplying the hours reasonably\nexpended on the whole litigation by a reasonable hourly rate may be excessive: `Again, the most critical factor is\nthe degree of success obtained.'\" Ramos v. Lamm, supra, 713 F.2d at 556, (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra,\n___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52). The application of these principles the Supreme Court\nstated was \"particularly important in complex civil rights litigation involving numerous challenges to institutional\npractices or conditions.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52.\nThe Court finds that upon viewing the results obtained by the plaintiffs in this litigation, and the number of hours\nexpended that the lodestar, previously determined, is excessive given the degree of success obtained. The\nSupreme Court in Hensley stated that district courts are vested with discretion in making an equitable judgment\nconcerning this question. Id. The trial court may in its discretion \"attempt to identify specific hours that should be\neliminated or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\" Id. The nature of the plaintiffs'\napplication effectively deprived the Court of the first option of eliminating specific hours so the second method will\nbe applied.\nAt the outset of this case the plaintiffs sought extensive changes in the conditions and operation of the\nAdjustment Center, but the results obtained, although significant, were limited in nature and fell far short of the\noriginal goal. The Court finds that the principles stated in Hensley are particularly appropriate here and thereby\nreduces the lodestar of $28,199.60 by a multiplier of .40 which reduces the lodestar to $16,919.76. See generally\nInstitutionalized Juveniles v. Secretary of Public Welfare, 568 F.Supp. 1020 (E.D.Pa.1983) (applied Hensley and\nreduced the lodestar by a factor of .50 for lack of success).\nIII. Adjustment to the Lodestar for Lack of Documentation and\nSpecificity\nAn applicant for attorney's fees bears the burden of establishing both his entitlement to an award and\ndocumenting the hours expended and the hourly rates. Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at\n1941, 76 L.Ed.2d at 53. Hensley stated that fee applicants should maintain billing time records in a manner that\nwill allow the reviewing court to identify time spent on distinct claims at least to the extent of identifying the\ngeneral subject matter of the time expenditures. Id. ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1941, f.n. 12, 76 L.Ed.2d at 53,\nf.n. 12. \"Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.\" \nId. ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d at 50.\nPlaintiffs in their fee applications submitted affidavits reflecting the amount of time expended and provided very\ngeneralized and vague statements in most instances as to specific nature of the work performed, i.e., time\nexpended on the various claims. The applications appeared to be a reconstruction of the time expended rather\nthan based on contemporaneous time records and as such were merely estimates of the time expended. The\nplaintiffs' counsel in particular did not document the specific nature of the many hours of meetings with witnesses,\n466 plaintiffs, and meetings among themselves. The documentation *466 supplied by Kemp to justify his expenditure\nof time was especially deficient. In some instances the date such time was expended was not provided. In\naddition, no specific evidence was provided as to the reasonableness of the rate sought under the appropriate\nstandard. The information supplied by the plaintiffs made it very difficult if not impossible for the Court to\nadequately review the reasonableness of the hours and apply the principles of Hensley v. Eckerhart.\nThe Eighth Circuit has stated that lawyers claiming statutory fee awards must insure that all the necessary\ninformation is presented to the court, i.e., detailed affidavits explaining and itemizing their fee claims. See Grunin\nv. International House of Pancakes, 513 F.2d 114, 127 (8th Cir.),cert. denied423 U.S. 864, 96 S.Ct. 124, 46\nL.Ed.2d 93 (1975); Jorstad v. I.D.S. Realty Trust, supra at 1313. Other circuits, however, have been much more\n\nexplicit in defining the type of documentation preferred or required. In New York Ass'n for Retarded Children v.\nCarey, 711 F.2d 1136 (2nd Cir.1983), the court stated, in light of the problems they had experienced with\nundocumented and underdocumented fee requests, that\n(h)ereafter, any attorney00whether a private practitioner or an employee of a nonprofit law office\n97\nwho applies for court-ordered compensation in the circuit for work done after the date of this\nopinion must document the application with contemporaneous time records. These records should\nspecify for each attorney, the date, the hours expended, and the nature of the work done.\nId. at 1148; See also McCann v. Coughlin, 698 F.2d 112 (2nd Cir.1983) (expressed a preference for\ncontemporaneous time records). The absence of these kinds of records deprives the court of a basis for\nevaluating the reasonableness of the requested fees in terms of efficiency, staffing, and duplication of effort. In\naddition, as in this case, where an adjustment in the fee petition is warranted to reflect the plaintiffs' degree of\nsuccess under Hensley, the court is also deprived of an effective means of making this apportionment. McCann v.\nCoughlin, supra at 131. In Nadeau v. Helgemoe, supra at 279, the court held that \"(a)s for the future, we will not\nview with sympathy any claim that a district court abused its discretion in awarding unreasonably low attorney's\nfees in a suit in which plaintiffs were only partially successful if counsel's records do not provide a proper basis for\ndetermining how much time was spent on particular claims.\"\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia recently set out in great detail the obligations of an applicant for\nattorneys' fees with respect to documentation and the procedures to be followed by the district courts in\nevaluating the applications. National Ass'n of Concerned Vets v. Secretary of Defense, 675 F.2d 1319\n(D.C.Cir.1982). Attorneys seeking statutory awards of attorney fees would be well-advised to consult this opinion\nas a guide.\nThe plaintiffs' application for attorneys' fees in terms of documentation presented the Court with numerous\nproblems. The plaintiffs failed to provide adequate documentation of the specific nature of the work performed in\nmany of its out-of-court hours. The Court in evaluating the reasonableness of the hours claimed did not address\nitself to the problem of documentation and specificity and made no reductions in the number of hours on that\nbasis. Although the Court hesitates to reduce the lodestar further due to the lack of documentation, such a\nreduction is demanded by the glaring deficiencies in the plaintiffs' fee application. The Court hereby reduces the\nlodestar of $16,919.76 by a factor of .10 reducing the lodestar to $15,227.78.\nIV. Summary\nThe Court found that plaintiffs were a prevailing party pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988 and as such were\nentitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees. The Court found that a reasonable number of hours for this\n467 litigation was 691.52 hours reflecting a reduction of 304.48 *467 hours from the plaintiffs' claim of 996 hours.\nThese reductions were primarily based upon duplication of effort and excessiveness of the number of hours\nclaimed. The Court found that a reasonable rate for the services of plaintiffs' counsel to be in the case of Gilbert\nand Stanley $75.00 per hour for in-court time and $60.00 per hour for out-of-court time. The Court accepted\nCummings' claimed rate of $40.00 and $30.00 per hour for in-court and out-of-court time respectively. The Court\napplied a rate of $10.00 per hour to Kemp's claim. The following reflects the lodestar computation for plaintiffs'\ncounsel:\n               Total Lodestar\nGilbert            $ 8,050.50\nStanley             14,290.50\nCummings             3,558.60\nKemp                 2,300.00\n                  ___________\n                   $28,199.60\n\nThe Court rejected plaintiffs' claim for enhancement of the lodestar finding that enhancement was not appropriate\nunder the circumstances. The Court found upon applying the mandate in Hensley v. Eckerhart that the\nrelationship between the results of litigation and the lodestar of $28,199.60 that the lodestar should be reduced\nby a factor of .40 to $16,919.76. The lodestar was further reduced by a factor of .10 for lack of documentation\nand specificity to an adjusted lodestar of $15,227.78. Cummings also applied for an award of $1,008.90 for costs,\nwhich request was not objected to by the defendant.\nThe Court based upon the preceding analysis hereby orders that judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs in\n[2]\nthe amount of $15,227.78 for attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988 and costs of $1,008.90.  The\naward of $15,227.78 shall be apportioned between plaintiffs' counsel in the following manner: (adjustments to the\nlodestar were apportioned between plaintiffs' counsel in relation to each counsel's proportion of the lodestar\nbefore adjustment)\n                  Amount Awarded\nGilbert             $ 4,347.27\nStanley               7,716.87\nCummings              1,921.64\nKemp                  1,242.00\n                   ___________\n                    $15,227.78\n[1] No appeal having been taken, this decision has become final.\n[2] Costs shall be made a part of the award made to Cummings.\n[] ($40.00 in-court and $30.00 out-of-court)\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "694 F.2d 155 (1982)\nElroy Lynn WABASHA, Appellant,\nv.\nHerman SOLEM, Warden, South Dakota State Penitentiary and Mark Meierhenry, Attorney\nGeneral, State of South Dakota, Appellees.\nNos. 82-1491, 82-1492.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.\nSubmitted September 17, 1982.\nDecided December 1, 1982.\n156 *156 Mark V. Meierhenry, Atty. Gen., Richard Dale, Asst. Atty. Gen., Pierre, S.D., for appellees.\nJohn P. Abbott, Brandon, S.D., for appellant.\nBefore LAY, Chief Judge, FLOYD R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge, and BRIGHT, Circuit Judge.\nFLOYD R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.\nElroy Wabasha appeals the district court's denial of two separate petitions for writs of habeas corpus pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 2254 (1976). The two cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal. We affirm the judgments of\n[1]\nthe district court.  In the first petition he alleges that his guilty plea was not valid. In the second petition he\nalleges that his sentence on a subsequent charge was invalid because the sentencing judge suffered from a\nmental illness which manifested itself in kleptomania.\nI.\nIn the first petition Wabasha complains of a conviction for first degree robbery which rested on a guilty plea\n157 entered in State court. The information was read to Wabasha at his arraignment and charged *157 him with\nrobbing a liquor store of Three Hundred Fifty-Five Dollars ($355.00) from its cash register by using a handgun to\n[2]\nput fear in a person in the store.  Wabasha chose not to acquire the services of an attorney, although the trial\ncourt strongly encouraged him to do so.\nAfter the information was read, Wabasha entered his plea of guilty. There was no evidence at the arraignment\nthat there was a plea bargain. After Wabasha's plea, the court explained the rights Wabasha was waiving by\npleading guilty, including the rights to counsel, jury trial, confrontation, cross-examination, compulsory process,\nand the right against self-incrimination. The court also explained the state's burden of proof and the maximum\npenalty for the offense. The court then asked Wabasha about the robbery, and Wabasha admitted that he robbed\nthe store, had a handgun, and was pleading guilty because he was guilty. Finally, the court asked Wabasha\nwhether it was still his intention to enter his plea of guilty, and Wabasha said it was. The judge then accepted the\nguilty plea. The next day the same judge sentenced Wabasha to fifteen years in prison.\nThe second petition complains of the sentence Wabasha received for striking a prison guard while serving his\nsentence for robbery. Pursuant to a plea bargain, Wabasha pled guilty to aggravated assault and the court\nimposed a three-year sentence. Seven weeks after the sentencing, the sentencing judge pled guilty to petty theft,\nand three weeks later he resigned from the bench, admitting he suffered from a mental illness which manifested\nitself in kleptomania. Wabasha argues the sentence is void because of the sentencing judge's mental illness.\n\nII.\nIn the first petition, Wabasha makes four arguments supporting his contention that his guilty plea to armed\nrobbery was invalid.\nA.\nWabasha first argues that the arraignment record does not establish the requisite factual basis for the plea\nbecause there was not a basis for one of the elements of first degree robbery 00 effectuation of the robbery by\n97\nmeans of force or fear. Wabasha argues he merely admitted possessing the handgun at the time of the robbery.\nWabasha's argument fails for two reasons. First, the factual basis requirement rests in Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f), not\nthe Constitution. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261-62, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); \nMcCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 464, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1169-70, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). C. Whitebread, \nCriminal Procedure, 409 n. 14 (1980). An express admission of guilt is not constitutionally required. North\nCarolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S.Ct. 160, 167, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). Establishment of a factual basis\nmay be constitutionally required when the guilty plea is accompanied by claims of innocence. Id. at 38, n. 10, 91\nS.Ct. 167, n. 10. Therefore, Wabasha has not made a cognizable claim under the habeas corpus statute.\nSecond, even if a factual basis were constitutionally required, such a basis was established in this case. The\ninformation clearly charged Wabasha with all the elements of first degree robbery. Wabasha admitted he had\n158 robbed the liquor store, *158 had a handgun, and was guilty. When his statements and his admissions are read in\nthe context of the recitation of the charges there clearly was a factual basis for the charge; his contentions to the\ncontrary are frivolous.\nB.\nWabasha next argues that his plea was not made voluntarily and intelligently, as is constitutionally required.\nWabasha makes three arguments in support of this contention. First, he asserts that he did not understand the\nnature of the charge against him or the elements of the crime because the court did not tell him that first degree\nrobbery required that force or fear be used to accomplish the robbery. He relies on Henderson v. Morgan, 426\nU.S. 637, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976) for the proposition that an explanation by the court of every\nelement of a crime is a constitutional prerequisite to a valid guilty plea.\nWabasha reads Henderson too broadly. In Henderson, the Supreme Court held that a guilty plea to second\ndegree murder was involuntary because the petitioner was not informed that intent to cause death was an\nelement of the offense. The court specifically stated that it was not deciding whether every element of the offense\nmust be described, but it assumed that an understanding of the nature of the charge would not always require\nsuch a description. The court in Henderson emphasized that intent was a critical element of the charge involved\nin that case and required adequate notice of that fact be made known to a criminal defendant. Id. at 647, n. 18,\n96 S.Ct. 2258, n. 18.\nFurthermore, the reading of the information provided Wabasha with a description of the nature of the charges\nagainst him. The court in Henderson pointed out that the petitioner in that case was never formally charged with\nthe offense to which he pled guilty (second degree murder). Id. at 645, 96 S.Ct. at 2258. When the information is\n[3]\nclear and not complex, like the one involved here,  a reading of the information puts the accused on notice of\nthe nature of the charge against him. United States v. Dayton, 604 F.2d 931, 938 (5th Cir.1979),cert. denied,445\nU.S. 904, 100 S.Ct. 1080, 63 L.Ed.2d 320 (1980); See United States v. Saft, 558 F.2d 1073, 1079-80 (2nd\nCir.1977).\nWabasha also argues that his plea was not made voluntarily and intelligently because the court did not explain\nthe rights he was waiving by pleading guilty until after the plea was accepted. It is true that a plea can be\n\ninvoluntary because the accused does not understand the nature of the constitutional protections he is waiving. \nHenderson, 426 U.S. at 645, n. 13, 96 S.Ct. at 2257, n. 13. In the instant case, the court asked Wabasha how he\nwas pleading and Wabasha answered guilty. The court then explained Wabasha's constitutional rights, and then\nasked Wabasha whether he still desired to plead guilty. It is clear that in this context the court was ready to allow\nWabasha to change his plea to not guilty if Wabasha so desired; and in fact did not accept the plea until\nWabasha satisfied the judge that Wabasha understood the charge and related the factual events of the armed\nrobbery. If we found this procedure inadequate, a court would have to waste its time explaining the\nconsequences of a guilty plea to persons who had no intention of pleading guilty.\nWabasha's last assertion to support his argument that the plea was not made voluntarily and intelligently is that\nlaw enforcement officials threatened to seek the maximum sentence and a possible habitual offender charge if\nWabasha pled not guilty. However, when this argument was raised in a post-conviction petition in state court, the\ncourt found that no such threat had been made. The South Dakota Supreme Court affirmed that finding. \nWabasha v. State, 292 N.W.2d 340, 342 (S.D.1980). We must accept the state court's factual findings as correct\nunless the petitioner establishes to the contrary, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (1976); Sumner v. Mata, 449 U.S. 539,\n159 546-47, 101 *159 S.Ct. 764, 769-70, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981). Here, Wabasha has wholly failed to establish his\ncontention on this issue.\nC.\nWabasha's third argument that his guilty plea was invalid is that the plea was without counsel and his waiver of\nthe right to counsel was involuntary. He argues the waiver was involuntary because of the threats made by law\nenforcement officials described in the preceding paragraph. Again we must accept the state court's conclusions\nthat such threats were not made, and, therefore, this claim must likewise fall. Also, the state trial judge strongly\nand repeatedly urged Wabasha to accept the court's offer to appoint counsel, but Wabasha, who was no stranger\n[4]\nto criminal judicial proceedings, refused to do so.\nD.\nWabasha's final argument that his guilty plea was invalid is that the sentencing court, as well as the court at the\narraignment, had to establish a factual basis and had to explain the elements of the offense to Wabasha. The\nsentencing court did not repeat the elements of the offense or reestablish a factual basis.\nWabasha relies on Santobello which states that the sentencing judge must develop a factual basis for a guilty\nplea. 404 U.S. at 261, 92 S.Ct. at 498. However, this requirement is based on Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, not the\nConstitution. Id. There is no indication that Wabasha suffered any prejudice in the instant case because the\nsentencing followed the arraignment by less than twenty-four hours and the same judge presided at both\nproceedings. The factual basis for the plea was developed at the arraignment. The sentencing court's lack of\nredundancy did not establish a constitutional violation.\nIII.\nWabasha's other habeas corpus petition relates to the sentence he received for assaulting a prison guard while\nserving the robbery sentence. Wabasha argues that his three-year sentence, pursuant to a plea bargain, is void\nbecause of the revelation that the sentencing judge was suffering from a mental illness at the time he sentenced\nWabasha. Wabasha argues that a sentencing by a judge suffering from a mental illness is a per se violation of\ndue process.\nWe will not assume that the sentencing judge's mental illness was a per se constitutional violation. In habeas\ncorpus proceedings, harm or prejudice must be shown to warrant relief. Lockett v. Blackburn, 571 F.2d 309, 314\n(5th Cir.),cert. denied,439 U.S. 873, 99 S.Ct. 207, 58 L.Ed.2d 186 (1978); Willis v. Ciccone, 506 F.2d 1011, 1015\n(8th Cir.1974). In this case there is no showing of actual prejudice. Wabasha's contention on this issue is\nspecious because: (1) the sentence was based on a plea bargain and the sentencing judge's role was merely\n\none of approving an agreement Wabasha and the prosecutor had previously made, and (2) the sentencing judge\nstated in a deposition taken for Wabasha's post-conviction proceeding that he believed the mental illness either\ndid not affect his sentencing or made him more liberal. With the absence of evidence of any prejudice to\nWabasha, this claim must also fall.\nHaving concluded that Wabasha's guilty plea was valid and he suffered no prejudice as a result of the sentencing\njudge's mental illness, we affirm the judgments of the district court.\nLAY, Chief Judge, dissenting.\n160 Under the circumstances of this case I cannot find that Wabasha knowingly and *160 intelligently waived his\n\"right to counsel.\" The state court advised him that he was entitled to have counsel represent him at all stages of\nthe proceedings at no cost to him. The court \"strongly encouraged\" him to get counsel because of the\nseriousness of the offense involved and the possibility of imprisonment for up to 20 years. The following colloquy\nthen took place:\nTHE COURT: I've advised you previously of your right to have an attorney here to represent you;\nis that correct?\nMR. WABASHA: Yes.\nTHE COURT: And I have recommended to you that you not proceed without the services of an\nattorney, have I not?\nMR. WABASHA: Yes.\nTHE COURT: And you've indicated to this Court you do not desire the services of an attorney?\nMR. WABASHA: No.\nTHE COURT: And I have apprised you that if you did not have enough money to retain an attorney\nthis Court would provide an attorney for you at no cost to you?\nMR. WABASHA: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Do you know and understand this?\nMR. WABASHA: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Is it still your desire to proceed?\nMR. WABASHA: Yes.\nTranscript of arraignment at 4-5.\nThe law requires much more for an effective waiver of counsel. Merely giving lip service by saying yes or no to\nstereotyped questions is not sufficient. See Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S.Ct. 884, 890, 8 L.Ed.2d\n70 (1962); Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 722, 68 S.Ct. 316, 322, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948); Johnson v. Zerbst,\n304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Before waiver of counsel should be approved\nthere must be a penetrating and comprehensive discussion between the court and the accused. In the Von\nMoltke case Justice Black wrote for a plurality of the Court:\nTo be valid such waiver must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the\nstatutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible\ndefenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a\nbroad understanding of the whole matter. A judge can make certain that an accused's professed\nwaiver of counsel is understandingly and wisely made only from a penetrating and comprehensive\nexamination of all the circumstances under which such a plea is tendered.\n332 U.S. at 724, 68 S.Ct. at 323.\n\nAlthough no court has required Justice Black's precise litany of questions, other courts have required some\njudicial inquiry to ascertain that the defendant's waiver is wisely made. Cf. United States v. Welty, 674 F.2d 185,\n187-88 (3d Cir.1982) (where on eve of trial defendant seeks new counsel or to proceed pro se, the district court\nhas the \"responsibility of ensuring that any decision by the defendant to represent himself is intelligently and\ncompetently made.... Perfunctory questioning is not sufficient.\"); United States v. King, 582 F.2d 888, 889-90 (4th\nCir.1978) (district judge's explanation of the dangers of self-representation informed defendant of considerations\nnecessary for an intelligent waiver and defendant's responses indicated he made his choice \"with his eyes\nopen.\"); Chapman v. United States, 553 F.2d 886, 892 (5th Cir.1977) (where defendant clearly asserts the right to\ndefend pro se, \"a trial judge should engage in a dialogue with such a defendant, explaining to him the\nconsequences of defending pro se.\"). The Fourth Circuit recently observed \"[m]erely asking a defendant if he\nwants an attorney is inadequate to inform the defendant of his right to counsel.\" United States v. Johnson, 659\nF.2d 415, 417 (4th Cir.1981). The American Bar Association Standards Relating to Providing Defense Services\n(Approved Draft 1968) summarizes these principles in section 7.2:\nThe accused's failure to request counsel or his announced intention to plead guilty should not of\n161 itself be construed to constitute *161 a waiver. An accused should not be deemed to have waived\nthe assistance of counsel until the entire process of offering counsel has been completed and a\nthorough inquiry into the accused's comprehension of that offer and his capacity to make the\nchoice intelligently and understandingly has been made. No waiver should be found to have been\nmade where it appears that the accused is unable to make an intelligent and understanding\nchoice because of his mental condition, age, education, experience, the nature or complexity of\nthe case, or other factors.\n[1]\nSee id. commentary at 63.\nFor an accused to make an intelligent waiver a trial judge must be assured that a defendant has a broad\nunderstanding of what an attorney might do for him. The specific nature of the charge must be spelled out, not in\nconclusory terms, but so that the accused can fully understand what is confronting him. Thereafter, a trial judge\nshould determine if the accused fully appreciates any possible defenses to the charge and whether mitigating\ncircumstances may exist that a lawyer might present on his behalf. The accused should be informed and should\ndemonstrate a complete understanding of possible defenses that might exist under the circumstances. If there\nare technical difficulties in the questions raised beyond the capacity of the accused to understand them the trial\ncourt should be reluctant to accept the waiver. Cf. Cash v. Culver, 358 U.S. 633, 636-37, 79 S.Ct. 432, 435, 3\nL.Ed.2d 557 (1959) (several factors render criminal proceedings without counsel so apt to result in injustice as to\nbe fundamentally unfair); Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 161-62, 78 S.Ct. 191, 195, 2 L.Ed.2d 167 (1957) (a\nfinding of waiver is not lightly made).\nA legal waiver of counsel must demonstrate \"an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or\nprivilege.\" Such a waiver must be \"intelligent.\" Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. at 464, 58 S.Ct. at 1023 (emphasis\nadded); see also Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 482, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1883, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981); McKee v.\nHarris, 649 F.2d 927, 930 (2d Cir.1981),cert. denied,456 U.S. 917, 102 S.Ct. 1773, 72 L.Ed.2d 177 (1982); cf. \nTollett v. United States, 444 F.2d 622, 624 (8th Cir.1971) (\"The law is clear that the sixth amendment guarantee of\nthe right to counsel in a federal criminal trial can only be waived after a careful explanation of the defendant's\nrights by the court and an intelligent exercise of the choice by the defendant.\").\nThe law abhors forfeiture. Here the court condones forfeiture of one's liberty without legal representation based\nupon a formalistic inquiry by the state court and an abbreviated record. I cannot subscribe to it. Conscientious\nstate and federal trial judges should require much, much more before accepting a waiver of counsel in criminal\ncases.\n[1] The Honorable John B. Jones, United States District Judge, District of South Dakota.\n[2] The information read: \n\nElroy Lynn Wabasha ... did willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take from the possession of Jack Sletten certain\npersonal property, to-wit: checks and cash in good and lawful money of the United States of America in the\namount of $355.76, which said personal property was then and there in a certain cash register then and there\nbeing in the immediate presence of said Jack Sletten and in a building operated as Westside Bottle Stop located\nat 1109 West 9th Yankton, South Dakota, and which said taking was then and there accomplished by said\nDefendant by means of a handgun, which said handgun the said Defendant then and there held in his hands and\npointed the same at said Jack Sletten thereby putting him in fear of some immediate injury to his person and the\nsaid Defendant did by said means commit the crime of robbery in the first degree ....\n[3] See note 2, supra.\n[4] The dissent argues that Wabasha's waiver of his right to counsel was involuntary because the trial court did\nnot provide him with enough information for his waiver to have been made knowingly and intelligently. Wabasha\ndoes not argue that his waiver was in any way based on a lack of information. We will not assume that Wabasha\ndid not have enough information for a knowing and intelligent waiver when Wabasha himself makes no such\nassertion. Furthermore, a defendant has a constitutional right to proceed pro se. Faretta v. California, 422 U.S.\n806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975).\n[1] Section 7.2 suggests that an inquiry into the defendant's background, age, education, mental condition, and\nexperience is appropriate. Wabasha, a Native American, was 20 years old at the time of arraignment and had a\nseventh or eighth grade education. He had a reading level of third or fourth grade.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Plain \ntiffs premised  their application for  attorneys'  fees  upon  the  judgment \nfiled  by  this Court  on  February  18,  1983.  Plaintiffs'  application \npresented  the  following  issues:  (1)  whether  the  plaintiffs were  \"pre \nvailing parties\"  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  section 1983;  and  (2)  it the \nplaintiffs were  prevailing parties,  what  constitutes a  \"reasonable  fee\" \nunder  the  circumstances? \nResolving  these  issues  requires  an  examination  of the  nature  and \nresults  of  the  underlying  litigation.  The  following  is a  summary  of  the \nunpublished  memorandum  decision  and  order of  this  Court  in the  underlying \naction.  Wabasha  v.  Solem,  79-4064  (D.S.D.  April 13.  1982).1  Plaintiffs \non  May  21,  1979,  filed  a  class action  suit against  the defendant  Herman \nSolem,  on  behalf  of all Native  American  inmates  confined  in the  Adjustment \nINo  appeal  having been  taken,  this decision has  become  final. \n- 1  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 2 of 35(cid:10)\n• \n• \nCenter  at the  South  Dakota  Penitentiary.  This  class  action civil rights \nsuit brought  under 42  U.S.C.  sections 1983,  1984.  and  1986,  alleged  that \nthe  conditions  of confinement  in the  Adjustment  Center  constituted  cruel \nand  unusual  punishment  in violation  of  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth Amend- . \nments  to  the  United  States Constitution.  The  complaint  further  alleged \nthat the  procedures  governing  initial confinement  in the  Adjustment \nCenter and  transfers within  the  Adjustment  Center violated the  Fifth \nand  Fourteenth Amendment  guarantees  of procedural  due  process  and  also \nthat these  procedures  violated  equal  protection as  guaranteed  by  the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nA motion  for a  preliminary  injunction was  filed  simultaneously with \nthe  complaint;  however,  no  hearing was  requested  or held  at that time. \nThe  defendant  answered  the  complaint  on  June  12,  1979.  On  June  2,  1980, \nat the  second  pretrial conference  the  plaintiff class was  enlarged,  over \nthe  objection  of the  defendant,  to  include  all  inmates  who  have  or will \nbe  subjected  to disciplinary  confinement  in the  Adjustment  Center with  a \nsubclass  of  all Native American  inmates.  The  Court  certified  the  class, \nas  amended,  at the  pretrial conference  but  reserved  ruling  on  whether  the \nplaintiffs fairly  and  adequately protected  the  interests  of  the  class,  as \nrequired  by  Fed.R.Civ.P.  23(a)(4). \nA court  trial commenced  on  June  3,  1980.  The  trial  included  a  tour \nof  the  Adjustment  Center by  the  Court  on  June  3,  1980.  In open  court \non  June  6,  1980,  the  plaintiffs renewed  their previous  motion  for a \npreliminary  injunction.  This  motion  sought  to  enjoin the  defendant \nfrom  confining  any  inmates  in  the  plaintiff class  to  the  segregation \nsection  (most  restrictive  level  of confinement)  of  the  Adjustment  Center \nfor  a  period  in excess  of thirty  (30)  days.  A hearing was  held  on  the \nmotion  on  June  9,  1980,  at which  the  defendant agreed  to  change  the \nwritten policy  regarding  the  confinement  in the  punitive  segregation \nsection  of  the  Adjustment  Center by  amending  Policy Statement  3-26  of \nthe  Living  Guide  and  Regulation  of  the South  Dakota  Penitentiary 1976. \nThis  change  in written  policy  limited  confinement  in the  segregation \nunit  to a  maximum  of  thirty  (30)  days.  The  defendant,  however,  contended \n- 2  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 3 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nthat  this amendment  reflected  only  a  change  in written policy but not \na  change  in actual  practice  since  no  one  had  been  confined  to  segregation \nmore  than nine  (9)  days  since  August,  1978.  The  Court  denied  the  plain \ntiffs'  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction since the  amendment  of  the \npolicy obviated  the  need  for  the  requested  relief. \nThe  trial reconvened  December  8,  1980,  and  continued  through \nDecember  11,  1980.  The  Court  filed  its memorandum  decision  and  order \non  April  13,  1982.  Four  issues  were  presented  to  the  Court  for  resolu \ntion: \n(1)  Whether  the  action  was  properly maintained  as  a  class  action; \n(2)  Eighth  Amendment  issues  related  to  confinement  in the  Adjust \nment  Center; \n(3)  Due  process  (Fifth and  Fourteenth Amendments)  contentions  with \nrespect  to disciplinary and  classification procedures  governing \nplacement  and  detention  in the  Adjustment  Center;  and \n(4)  Racial  discrimination as  to  placement and  continued  confinement \nin the  Adjustment  Center under  the  equal  protection clause  of \nthe  Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe  Court  held  that  the  plaintiffs'  action was  properly  maintained \nas  a  class  action pursuant  to  Fed.R.Civ.P.  23(a)(b).  The  Court  did not, \nhowever  find  that the  conditions  in the  Adjustment  Center when  considered \nin toto  to  be  intolerable  or  shocking  to the  conscience  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment  test  established  in Trop  v.  Dulles,  356  U.S.  86,  101,  78  S.ct. \n590,  2  L.Ed.2d  630  (1957);  See  also,  Hutto  v.  Finney,  437  U.S.  678,  98 \nS.Ct.  2565,  57  L.Ed.2d  522  (1978);  Bono  v.  Saxbe,  620  F.2d  609  (7th Cir. \n1980).  The  Court  did.  however,  advise  the  defendant  to  consider changing \nor modifying  certain  individual  conditions and  found  that  there were  some \nconditions  that must  be  changed. \nThe  Court  considered  separately the  individual  conditions  challenged \nby  the  plaintiffs on  constitutional  grounds.  A summary  of the  Court's \nfindings  with  respect  to  each  of the  challenged  conditions  are  as  follows: \n(1)  Thirty day  limit on  punitive  isolation -\n- 3  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 4 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \n(a)  Segregation - The  5-day minimum  and  3D-day  maximum \npursuant  to  the  amended  policy  statement  #3.26  conformed \nto  Hutto  v.  Finney,  supra,  and  was  not  unconstitutional; \n(b)  Third  Grade  - The  5-day minimum  and  90-day  maximum  per \noffense  on  the  time  of  confinement did not  violate the \nEighth Amendment; \n(c)  Second  Grade  - The  5-day minimum  and  90-day maximum  per \noffense  on  the  time  of confinement  did  not violate  the \nEighth Amendment. \n(2)  Medical  and  psychiatric  care  - No  Eighth Amendment  violation \nas  to medical  and  psychiatric care  were  found.  The  Court \nspecifically found  that medical  care was  provided  when  needed \nand  when  requested  and  found  for purposes  of  clarification \nthat  psychiatric  care  like medical  care must  be  provided  when \nmedically  indicated. \n(3)  Lighting  - That  the  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center were \ndeprived  of adequate  lighting  - a  basic  necessity. \n(4)  Clothing  and  shelter - the  Court  held  that  inmates  must  be \nprovided  with  a  cot,  a  mattress,  and  appropriate  bedding, \nwhich  may  be  taken  away  if they are  used  in a  destructive \nmanner  or  the  privileges are  abused.  The  Court  did not, \nhowever,  find  any  violations  of  this  requirement  in  fact \nin the  Adjustment  Center but  merely  established this \nrequirement  for future  guidance. \n(5)  Ventilation  - The  ventilation was  found  to  be  constitutionally \nadequate. \n(6)  Sanitation - the  Court  prescribed  that  a  program  of daily \ntrash collection and  periodic  pest control must be  instituted, \nbut  did not,  however,  find  any  Eighth  Amendment  constitutional \nviolations. \n(7)  Diet  - No  constitutional violations were  found.  The  T.V. \ndinners  provided were  adequate  as  long as  supplements  were \nprovided. \n(8)  Recreational  exercise  -\n-4 -\n\n. --\" ~~,.:,<  Case 4:79-cv-0406•4      Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001•     P age 5 of 35(cid:10)\n(a)  Segregation and  Third  Grade  - No  recreation was  allowed \nor  provided  by  institution policy.  The  Court  found  that \nunder  the  conditions  existing  in the Adjustment  Center  -\n5-day minimum  in connection with  the  opportunity  to  obtain \nrelease via a  \"kite\"  - no  denial  of  recreational oppor \ntunity existed  but  an  informed  choice  not  to  participate \nin the  limited  recreation allowed  in Second  Grade. \n(b)  Second  Grade  and  Close  Custody  II  (CCU)  - Inmates  were \nallowed  15  minutes  of  recreation  per  day  in Second  Grade \nand  30  minutes  per day  in CCU.  The  Court,  however, \nexpressed  concern  over  the  limited  duration  of exercise \nand  nature  of  the  recreation provided,  but  stopped  short \nof finding  any  constitutional violations.  The  Court \nrequested  the  defendant  to  reevaluate  his policies  relating \nto  recreation and  exercise  but did  not  order any  changes. \n(9)  Access  to  the  law  library - Inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center \nwere  not  denied  access  to  the  courts  as  a  result  of  the  limited \naccess  to  the  law  library,  hence  the  Court  found  no  constitu \ntional violations.  The  Court,  however,  prescribed  that \nreasonable  access  must  be  provided  to  all  inmates  in the \nAdjustment  Center.  Reasonable  access  would  still allow a \ngiven  number  of  books  per day  and  require  the  return  of the \nbooks  before  new  books  could  be  received.  The  Court  directed \nthe  defendant  to  formulate  a  plan which would  allow reasonable \naccess  to  law  books  to  all  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center. \n(10)  Rehabilitation programs  - The  inmates  in the  Adjustment  Center \nand  CCU  are  not  provided  access  to vocational,  educational,  or \nwork  programs.  No  constitutional violations were  found  by  the \nCourt  with  respect  to  this  policy. \n(11)  Fire  protection - No  constitutional violations  were  found. \n(12)  Personal  hygiene  - No  constitutional violations were  found, \nbut  the  Court  suggested  to the  defendant  that he  reevaluate \nthe  shower  policy to  allow if possible  a  shower  on  a  more \nfrequent  basis,  but  stopped  short  of  ordering  them  to  do  so. \n(13)  Dark  cells - The  use  of dark  cells was  held not  to  be \n- 5  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 6 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nunconstitutional  per se  but  the  Court  mandated  that a  policy \nbe  developed  and  implemented  setting forth the circumstances \nwhich would  trigger such  confinement  and  the  conditions  of \nthe  confinement.  The  maximum  period  of  such  confinement \ncould not,  however,  exceed  twenty-four hours. \n(14)  strip searches  - Routine  strip searches without  probable \ncause,  of  all inmates  returning  from  non-contact visits was \nordered  to  be  immediately discontinued  as  violative  of  the \nEighth Amendment. \nThe  plaintiffs set forth  two  major procedural  due  process  contentions \nwith  respect  to  the  Adjustment  Center  (Segregation,  Third Grade,  and \nSecond  Grade).  The  first was  that before an  inmate  can  be  transferred \nfrom  Second  and  Third  Grade  to  Segregation,  the  inmate  must  be  afforded \na  second  (the  first being  the  proceedings  before  the  disciplinary board \nwhich  resulted  in confinement  in the  Adjustment  Center  initially)  full \nblown  due  process  hearing because  such  transfers  further  limit the \ninmate's  privileges.  The  defendant  argued  that  transfers  from  one \nlevel  in the Adjustment  Center to another  level  constituted  an  intra \ninstitution transfer and  as  such does  not  require  a  due  process  hearing \nas  long  as  the  inmate's  total  time  in the  Adjustment  Center does  not \nexceed  the  ninety  (90)  day  maximum. \nThis  Court  held  that the  initial procedures  for  confining  an  inmate \nto  the  Adjustment  Center  fully  complied  with  the requirements  of  Wolff v. \nMcDonnell,  418  U.s.  539,  94  S.ct.  2963,  41  L.Ed.2d  935  (1974).  No \nevidence  was  found  to  show  that the defendant  acted  unreasonably  or \narbitrarily  in effecting  transfers  from  Third  and  Second  Grade  to \nSegregation as  long  as  such  transfers  did not  result  in confinement \nbeyond  ninety  (90)  days  for  anyone  offense.  The  Court,  in addition, \nfound  that  conditions  in  all levels were  essentially the  same,  although \nthe  privileges afforded  to  inmates  in the  various  levels was  different. \nThe  Court was  not  willing  in the  absence  of  an  unreasonable  or arbitrary \nexercise  of  its discretion with  respect  to  meting  out  disCipline  and \nimplementing  penal  programs  to  interfere with  the  defendant's  day-to-day \n- 6  -\n\n~',~' .  Case 4:79-cv-0406•4   ' ~,   Do-.c. ~ u. ment 61     Filed 03/08/2001•     P age 7 of 35(cid:10)\nprogramming  within  the  Adjustment  Center. \nThe  plaintiffs'  second  procedural  due  process  contention was  that \nindeterminate  confinement  in the Adjustment  Center without  a  meaningful \nreview  of  their confinement  based  on  objective  criteria violated due \nprocess.  The  Court  held  that  the  inmates  so  confined were  not  entitled \nto  a  full-blown due  process  hearing  each  time  he  comes  up  for  review. \nThe  preexisting policy  of  the  defendant with  respect  to  review  of \nindeterminate  sentences was  a  review by  the  Classification Review  Board \ntwenty  days  after the  imposition  of  sentence  and  if confinement  was \ncontinued  then  such  confinement  was  reviewed  every  fifteen  days  until \nrelease.  The  inmate  was  not  present at the  review  hearing nor did he \nreceive  a  written report  from  the  board  indicating whether confinement \nwas  to  continue,  date  of  the  next  reView,  reasons  for  continued  confine \nment,  and  what  must  be  done  to  secure  release.  The  Court  held  that \nminimal  due  process  requires  that the  inmates  be  given  advance  notice \nof  the  hearing date,  opportunity to  submit  a  written report,  and  if \nconfinement  is continued  the  reasons  for continued  confinement,  what \nwas  expected  to  obtain  release,  and  the  objective  criteria to  be  applied \nat the  next  review  hearing. \nThe  defendant's  original  policy with  respect  to  Close  Custody  II \n(CCU)  (Administrative  Segregation)  was  that  the  Classification Review \nBoard  would  make  such  placements  without  notice  or a  hearing.  During \nthe  trial the  defendant  consented  to  change  in  the  procedures  employed \nby  the  Classification Review  Board  to  provide  inmates  a  formal  due \nprocess  hearing prior to  placement  in  the  CCU.  The  defendant  contended \nthat  this  change  in policy with  respect  to due  process  to  be  followed \nin making  placements  in CCU  was  not  constitutionally mandated. \nThe  Court.  based  upon  Wolff v.  McDonald.  supr!!:,  and  Enomoto  v. \nWright.  462  F.Supp.  397  (N.D.  Cal.  1976).  aff'd 434  u.s.  1052  (1978), \nfound  that the  rules  and  regulations  of the  South  Dakota  Penitentiary \ncreated a  justifiable expectation that an  inmate  could  remain  in the \n- 7  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-0\"4., ..0  6•4     D ocument 61     Filed 03/08/2001•     P age 8 of 35(cid:10)\ngeneral  prison  population  and  not be  confined  to  CCU  as  long  as  he  obeys \nthe  rules  and  regulations.  The  defendant  having  created  this  liberty \ninterest cannot  arbitrarily take  it away.  The  Classification Review \nBoard,  the  Court  held,  must  comply  with  minimum  due  process  procedures \n(notice  and  hearing)  before  transferring an  inmate  from  the  general \npopulation  to  CCU.  The  Court  further  required  the  Classification Review \nBoard  to  provide  the  inmates  a  list of  the  objective  criteria it applies \nin making  such  determinations  and  if confinement  in CCU  was  to  be \ncontinued,  the  inmate  must  be  provided  with  the  reasons  and  the  conduct \nrequired  to  obtain  release  as  required  by  Kelly v.  Brewer,  525  F.2d  394 \n(8th Cir.  1975). \nThe  plaintiffs'  final  claim was  that Native Americans  as  a  subclass \nwere  discriminated  against  in the  disciplinary process  in that they were \nsent more  often to  the  Adjustment  Center and  spent  longer  time  there \nthan whites.  In  support  of  their equal  protection claim. the  plaintiffs \nanalyzed  and  presented data  from  inmate  disciplinary files  and  produced \ncomputer  print-outs analyzing  the  statistics.  The  statistics presented \nby  the  plaintiffs were  severely  flawed  since  race. was  the  only controlled \nvariable  used  in the  analysis.  The  ClaSSification Review  Board,  however, \nconsiders  a  number  of other  factors  in  reaching  a  decision  about  disci \nplinary measures  which  were  not  controlled  in  the  plaintiffs'  analysis \nbased  only  on  race.  The  Court  found  that recidivism,  not  racism, \naccounted  for  the  sentencing disparities.  The  Court  held  that  the \nplaintiffs had  not  produced  sufficient evidence  of a  racially dispro \nportionate  impact,  hence  failed  to  establish a  prima  faCie  case  of \nracial discrimination.  See  Inmates  of  Nebraska v.  Greenholtz,  567  F.2d \nu.s. \n1368  (8th  Cir.  1977),  cert.  denied  439  841  (1978). \nJudgment  was  filed  by  the  Court  on  February 18,  1983,  consistent \nwith the  memorandum  decision  and  order.  The  judgment  entered  by  the \nCourt  reflected post-trial changes  made  by  the  defendant  in  response \nto  the  memorandum  decision  and  order.  The  judgment  sets  out  a  policy \nwith  respect  to  such  areas  as  lighting,  trash collection,  recreation, \nshowers,  access  to  law  library,  strip searches  upon  return  from  non-\n- 8  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064•     D ocument 61     Filed 03/08/20·011 •>      P age 9 of 35(cid:10)\ncontact visits discontinued,  except  for  reasonable  suspicion  of contra \nband  or  other prohibited  items,  and  review  of  confinement  of  CCU  inmates. \nThe  above  changes  in policy were  incorporated  into  the  Living  Guide  and \nRegulation  of  the  South  Dakota  State  Penitentiary. \nPlaintiffs'  attorneys  have  separately moved  or applied  to the  Court \nfor  an  award  of attorneys'  fees  pursuant  to 42  U.S.C.  section 1988. \nPlaintiffs  requested  an  award  of attorneys'  fees  pursuant  to 42  U.S.C. \nsection 1988  based  on  the  following  lodestar  (reasonable  hours  times \nreasonable  rate)  calculations: \nName  of  No.  of  In- No.  of Out- Tr!vel  HourI!

Eckerha1:!:.  supra,  the  Supreme  Court \nstated: \nThe  standard  for making  this  threshold  determination \nhas  been  framed  in various ways.  A typical formula \ntion  is that  \"plaintiffs may  be  considered  'prevailing \nparties'  for attorney's  fees  purposes  if they  succeed \non  any  significant  issue  in  litigation which  achieves \nsome  of the  benefit  the  parties  sought  in bringing \nthe  suit.\"  Nadeau  v.

The  School  District  of City  of  Ladue,  712  F.2d  379,  380  (8th Cir. \n1983).  The  Eighth  Circuit Court  of  Appeals  formulated  its own  standard \nfor making  this threshold  determination  prior to  the  decision  in Hensley. \nIn Reel  v.  Arkansas  Department  of Corrections,  672  F.2d  693  (8th  Cir. \n1982),  the  court  stated  that  n(a)  plaintiff qualifies  as  a  prevailing \nparty once  he  has  been  successful on a  single  substantial claim brought \nin the  context  of  a  civil rights  suit;  success  on  all claims  made  is \nnot  required.\"  Id.  at 697,  citing Buschee,v.

The  court  in li!.!1 \nfurther  stated  that  \"(i)t is sufficient  if a  significant  issue  is \n, ' \ndetermined  in the  plaintiff's favor  and  leads  to  the  aehievement  of \nsome  of the  benefits  sought  by  bringing  suit.\"  Id.  at 697,  citing \nOldham  v.

A court may  also  look  to  the  \"substance  of the \nlitigation's  outcome\"  to  determine  if the  plaintiff substantially \nprevailed.  Reel  v.

Southwestern Bell \nTelephone  Co.,  433  F.2d 421  (8th Cir.  1970).  The  First Circuit Court  of \nAppeals  in Nadeau  v.  Helgemoe,  supra,  established  a  two-fold  test for \ndetermining who  was  the  prevailing party  in a  case  which  has  been  settled. \nThis  test was  adopted  by  the  Eighth  Circuit in United  Handicapped \nFederation v.  Andre.  supra  at 346.  This  analysis  applies  equally to the \nquestion  of  a  plaintiff's entitlement to attorney's  fees  where  the \nprocedures  challenged  have  been  changed  subsequent  to ·the filing  of the \nplaintiff's lawsuit,  but  no  formal  judgment  or  settlement decree  mandates \nsuch  changes.  See  e.g.  Ross  v.  Horn.  598  F.2d  1312.  1314  (3rd  Cir. \n1979),  cert.  denied  448  U.S.  906  (1980);  Institutionalized Juveniles' \nv.  Secretary  of  Public  \"[elfare,  568  F.Supp.  1020  (E.D.Pa.  1983). \nThe  first part  of  the  Nadeau  two-part  test presents a  factual \nquestion.  This  test  requires  that  plaintiff's suit and  their \nH ••• \nattorney's  efforts  ••• (be)  a  necessary and  important  factor  in \nachieving  the  improvements ••• \"  Nadeau  v.  Helgemoe  at 281.  The \nfactual  test essentially requires  a  causal relationship  between  the \nplaintiff's lawsuit and  the  beneficial changes  implemented  by  the \ndefendant.  Gurule  v.  Wilson,  635  F.2d  782,  791-2  (lOth  Cir.  1980). \nIt is not,  however,  necessary  for· the  plaintiff's lawsuit  to be  the \nsole  cause  or even  the  primary  cause  of  the  changes.

If the  defendant's  actions  were  made \ngratuitously  or voluntarily,  the  plaintiffs did  not  legally prevail  and \nthe  second  part  of  the  Nadeau  test goes  unsatisfied.  The  Eighth  Circuit \nCourt  of  Appeals  defined  this  test as  \" ••• whether  defendant's  conduct \ncan  be  viewed  as  'gratuitous,'  that  is,  whether  plaintiff's lawsuit was \n'frivolous,  unreasonable,  or groundless,'\" United  Handicapped  Federation \nv.  Andre,  supra  at  347. \nPlaintiffs  contended  that they were  obviously  a  \"prevailing  party\" \nalthough they did  not  prevail  on  all  of  the  claims.  The  plaintiffs base \nthis  contention  upon  their  success  with  respect  to  obtaining beneficial \nchanges  in disciplinary  and  classification procedures  in relation to  the \nAdjustment  Center and  CCU  and  in  obtaining  specific  changes  in living \nconditions  and  entitlements  in the  Adjustment  Center and  CCU.  The  defen \ndant,  however,  takes  issue  with  the  plaintiffs'  contentions.  The  defen \ndant  accurately  points  out  that  the  plaintiffs enjoyed  no  success  on  their \nequal  protection  (race discrimination)  claims nor  on  their overall  claim \nthat  the  conditions  in the  Adjustment  Center violated  the  Eighth  Amend \nment's  prohibition against  cruel  and  unusual  punishment.  The  defendant \ncontended  that  plaintiffs achieved  only  full  or partial  limited  success \nin  only  a  few  of  the  areas  in which  changes  were  sought.  The  defendant \ncharacterized  these  changes  as  minor  adjustments  or simply  a  fine  tuning \nof  existing  circumstances. \nThe  Court  finds  that the  plaintiffs are  a  \"prevailing  party\"  and \nentitled  to  an  award  of  attorneys'  fees  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  section \n1988.  The  defendant  understates  the  degree  of  success  that plaintiffs \nattained  in the  litigation,  particularly as  it relates  to the  due  process \nissues.  In  resolving  the  question  whether  the  plaintiffs are  the \nprevailing  party,  the  Court  must  view  the  litigation as  a  whole  and  not \n- 12  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 13 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \njust balance  the  plaintiffs'  wins  against  their losses.

In viewing  the \nlitigation  afi  a  whole  the  plaintiffs hp.re  have  succeeded  on  \"significant \nor  substantial  iSfiup.fi\"  which  success  provided  at least  some  of  the  relief \nsought  by  the  litigation.  §ee  Hensley  v.

Without  considering  the  plain \n~ans_as \ntiffs'  limited  success  on  the  overall  Eighth  Amendment  claims  and  the \nchallenges  to  spp.cific  conditions,  the  plaintiffs  did  obtain  meaningful \nchanges  in the  procedural  due  process  area. \nSubstantial changes  in policy were  prompted  or catalyzed  by  the \nlitigation with  respect  to  the  procedures  that the  Classification Review \nBoard  must  comply  with  in making  the  initial placements  from  the  general \nprison  population  to  CCU.  The  causal  connection between  the  litigation \nand  the  changes  cannot  be  disputed,  satisfying the  first part of  the \nNadeau  test.  Prior  to  the  change  in procedures  by  the  defendant  the \nClassification Review  Board  would  make  such  placements  without  notice \nor a  hearing.  During  the  course  of  the  trial the  defendant  changed  the \nprocedures  to  provide  the  inmates  a  formal  due  process  nearing  prior to \nplacement  in  the  CCU.  The  Court  in  issuing  its memorandum  decision  and \norder  and  judgment  assumed  that  this  change  of  procedure  was  implemented \nby  the  defendant.  The  defendant  contended  that  this  change  was \ngratuitous  and  not  legally mandated.  This  Court,  however,  found  that \nthe  preexisting  rules  and  regulations  of the  penitentiary  created  a \njustifiable expectation  that an  inmate  could  remain  in  the  general \nprison population as  long  as  he  obeys  the  rules  which  liberty  interest \ncould not be  taken  away  without  affording  the  inmates  due  process.  See \nu.s. \nMeachum  v.  Fano,  427  215,  96  S.ct.  2532,  49  L.Ed.2d  451  (1976); \nMontayne  v.  Haynes,  427  u.s.  236,  96  S.ct.  2543,  49  L.Ed.2d 466  (1976); \nRichardson  v.  Lokey,  427  U.S.  902,  96  S.ct.  3186,  49  L.Ed.2d  1196  (1976); \nGurule  v.  '.'filson,  supra.  The  defendant's  action  in  changing  the  procedure \nwithout  court  order was  not  gratuitous,  but  constitutionally  required, \ntherefore  an  improvement  attributable  to  plaintiffs'  litigation.  The \nsecond  part  of  the  Nadeau  test  is also  satisfied  so  these  changes  are \n- 13  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 14 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nproperly  considered  in this  determination.  This  change  by  itself was \nclearly significant. \nThe  plaintiffs also  obtained  a  change  in the  review process  for \nthose  confined  in the  Adjustment  Center.  This  change  provided that  if \nconfinement  was  continued  after review,  the  inmate  must  be  notified  of \nthe  reasons  for  continued  confinement,  what was  expected  of  the  inmate \nto  obtain release,  and  the  objective  criteria that was  to be  applied  at \nthe  next  review.  (This  change  was  not,  however,  included  in the  judgment \nitself).  In  addition,  those  inmates  confined  to  CCU  will have  their cases \nreviewed  by  the  Classification Review  Board  at  least every ninety  (90) \ndays.  If such  confinement  is to continue,  then  the  inmate  must  be \nprovided  specific written reasons  why  such  confinement  will  continue, \nnotice  before  the  hearing,  opportunity  to  be  present  at  such  hearing  and \npresent  a  statement  or documentary  evidence,  and  those  unable  to prepare \ntheir own  cases  may  be  represented  by  their assigned  correctional \ncounsellors. \nA further change  in policy,  prompted  by  the litigation to  the \nbenefit of  the  plaintiff class but not  specifically noted  in the  judgment \nof  the court,  was  to  establish a  written policy with  respect  to  the \nmaximum  period  of confinement  in segregation.  The  first part  of  the \nNadeau  test  is again  satisfied without  any  dispute.  Prior to  the \nadoption  of  Policy statement  3.26 of Living Guide  and  Regulation of  the \nSouth  Dakota  Penitentiary there was  no  established policy as  to  the \nmaximum  time  that may  be  spent  in segregation per  offense.  During  the \ncourse  of trial,  the  defendant  proposed  and  adopted  Policy Statement \n3.26 which  limited  the  period  of confinement  in segregation to a  maximum \nof thirty  (30)  days  per offense.  Based  upon  this change  the  Court  denied \nplaintiffs'  motion  for a  preliminary  injunction and  mooted  any  question \nabout  this practice  during  the  trial.  The  defendant  cannot  reasonably \nconclude  that this change  was  gratuitous based  upon  the  mandate  in \nHutto v.  Finney,  437  u.s.  678  (1978).  This  change  in policy  satisfied \nboth parts  of the  Nadeau  test and  properly  considered  by  the  Court  in \nthis determination.  This  change.  while  it may  seem  miniscule  to  the \n- 14  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 15 of 35(cid:10)\n•  •  ';;r;' \ndefendant,  is not  insignificant  to  those  presently  or  in the  future \nconfined  to  segregation.  This  change  also  obtained  for  the  plaintiff \nclass  some  of  the  relief sought  by  the  litigation. \nAlthough  the  Court  did  not  find  any  constitutional violations with \nrespect  to the  living conditions  in the  Adjustment  Center,  it did \nrecommend  changes  in certain conditions  or policies  to  the  defendant \nand  in  some  cases  mandated  such  changes.  The  changes  which  the  defendant \nsubmitted  to  the  Court  in response  to  the  Court's memorandum  decision  and \norder were  incorporated  in the  judgment  of  the  Court.  These  changes \nresulted  in  improvements  in the  living  conditions  of  those  inmates \nconfined  to the  Adjustment  Center.  albeit minimal  in scope.  These \nimprovements  involved  the  following  areas: \n(1)  established  regulations  and  restrictions  on  the  use  of  dark \ncells; \n(2)  clarifies that psychiatric  care  must  be  provided  when  needed; \n(3)  individual choice  as  to amount  of wattage  in light bulbs  in \neach  cell up  to 100 watts; \n(4)  clarifies the  furnishings  that must  be  provided  in each  cell \nand  the basis  for their removal; \n(5)  daily trash  collection; \n(6)  increased frequency  of  recreational  opportunities  in Second \nGrade,  Third  Grade  and  CCU  and  nature  of  such  opportunities; \n(7)  increased  frequency  of  showers; \n(8)  increased access  to  law  books  and  established procedures  for \nadministering the  policy; \n(9)  strip searches  upon  return from  visits were \nnon~contact \ndiscontinued. \nThe  conditions  of confinement  in the  Adjustment  Center and  CCU \nfollowing  the  Court's  judgment  are  now  governed  by  written policies \nand  guidelines  whereas  before  they were  largely  informal  unstated  policy \nmatters.  This  change  improved  the  conditions  to scme  extent  of the \nplaintiff class and  obtains  some  of  the  relief  sought  by  the  litigation. \n- 15  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 16 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nThe  plaintiffs'  litigation clearly  catalyzed  these  improvements  as \na  question  of  fact,  but  these  changes  with a  few  exceptions were  not \nmandated  by  either the  Constitution  or  the  Court's memorandum  decision \nand  order,  but were  largely gratuitous.  Plaintiffs having  significantly \nsucceeded  in  their procedural  due  process  claims  therefore  makes  it \nunnecessary  for  the  Court  to determine  whether  plaintiffs'  success  as \nto  individual  living conditions  would  by  itself establish the  plaintiffs \nas  a  prevailing party.  Viewing  the  litigation as  a  whole  and  the \nresults  obtained,  the  plaintiffs  have  \"prevailed\"  within  the  context \nof 42  U.S.C.  section 1988. \nII.

The  Court  does  not  find  that  special \ncircumstances  exist here which would  make  an  award  of  attorneys'  fees \nunjust. \nHaving  concluded  that  the  plaintiffs are  a  prevailing party, \npursuant  to 42  U.S.C.  section  1988,  and  that no  \"special circumstances\" \nexist,  the next  step  is to  determine  the  amount  of a  reasonable  fee. \n\"(T)he  most  useful  starting point  for determining  the  amount  of a \nreasonable  fee  is the  number  of hours  reasonably  expended  on  the liti \ngation multiplied  by  a  reasonable  hourly  rate.\"  Hensley V.

Defendant  in response \nto plaintiffs'  request  submitted  a  chart which  divided  the  hours  claimed \ninto various  types  of activities.  Addressing  only  the  hours  claimed  by \nthe  attorneys,  the  defendant  presented  eight  categories  of  activities \nwhich  were  identified by  the  letters A through  G.  The  activities \nencompassed  by  Type  A through  G are all tasks  which  would  normally  be \nbilled to  a  private-fee-paying  client  in the  exercise  of billing  judg \nment.  Hensley v.  Eckerhart,  supra,  citing Copeland  v.  Marshall,  205 \nU.S.App.D.C.  390,  401,  641  F.2d  880,  891  (1980)  (en  banc).  See  also, \nRamos  v.

The  Tenth  Circuit  in \nRamos  v.

Id.  at 554.  The  potential duplioation  of \nservices,  especially when  multiple  attorneys  are  involved,  must  also  be \n1£. \nconsidered  in this determination. \nPlaintiffs olaimed  for  Type  A aotivity.  which  involved  meetings \nwith  clients and  witnesses,  a  total  of  88.5 hours,  - Gilbert  28.5 hours; \nStanley 20  hours;  and  Cummings  40  hours.  The  defendant  recommended \napproximately  22.5  hours  for  these  activities  (Type  A)  objecting \nprimarily because  the  hours  claimed  were  undocumented,  excessive,  and \nduplicative.  The  issues  raised  by  the  defendant  concerning  the \nspeoificity and  documentation  of the  fee  olaims  are  addressed  later as \na  separate  issue. \nConsidering  the  nature  of  this  oase,a total  of  88.5 hours  to meet \nwith witnesses  and  clients  is excessive.  This-case  did  not  turn upon \nthe  individual  experiences  of  anyone  of the. inmates,  but  primarily \nupon  the  regulations  and  policies of  the  defendant  governing  the \nconditions and  procedures  in  the  Adjustment  Center  as  it affected  the \nplaintiff class.  These  regulations  and  polioies could  have  been \nobtained  more  efficiently and  effectively by  other means.  Time  spent \nby  counsel  listening to  inmates'  complaints  about  conditions was  not \nreasonably expended  nor was  such  time  neoessary  to  effectively litigate \nthe  issues  in  this  case.  In addition,  it did  not  require  three  attorneys \nto  interview  the  clients  or witnesses.  This  expenditure  of  time  was \nessentially duplicative.  The  Court  finds  that a  reasonable  number  of \nhours  for  Type  A activity was  60  hours.  This  reduction  shall be \napportioned  between  the  three  attorneys  in the  following  manner: \nNo.  of Hours  No.  of Hours  Determined \nClaimed  TYpe  A  to  be  Reasonable \nGilbert  28.5  19.0 \nStanley  20.0  10.5 \nCummings  40.0  30.5 \n88.5 hours  60.0  hours \n- 18  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 19 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nType  B activity involved meetings  and  conferences  with  co-counsel. \nThe  plaintiffs'  counsel  claimed  a  total  of 102.5 hours  for  meetings  among \nthemselves.  Gilbert  claimed  42  hours,  Stanley  claimed  34  hours,  and \nCummings  claimed  26.5  hours  for Type  B activities.  The  defendant \nrecommended  36.5 hours  for  Type  B activity.  The  defendant  challenged  the \nneed  for  all three  lawyers  to  sit down  together  and  discuss  the  case,  the \nconflicts  in the  dates,  and  amounts  of  time  claimed.  The  defendant \nsuggested  that the  lead  attorney  should  have  met  with  each  of the  lawyers \nand  delegated  responsibilities  rather than tying up  three  lawyers  at one \ntime  with all aspects  of  the  case.  Approximately  half  of  the  hours \nclaimed  for  this activity involved  night  meetings  following  the  trial \ndays. \nThe  Court  acknowledges  the  necessity for meeting  among  counsel  to \ndiscuss  case  strategy and  other aspects  of  the  case,  but questions  the \nreasonableness  of  102.5 hours  for  such  meetings  involving  all three \nlawyers.  A better practice would  have  been for  plaintiffs  to designate \nlead  counsel  for  particular aspects  of the  case  and  for  that lawyer  to \ndelegate  responsibilities to  each  of the  others  to  minimize  duplication \nof  effort and  obviate  the  need  for all three  lawyers  to  meet  with  each \nother at the  same  time.  Although  the  total number  of  hours  claimed \nconsidering  that three  lawyers  were  involved  representing  the  same \nplaintiffs are  not  excessive,. it is duplicative and  redundant.  The \nCourt  finds  that 75.5  hours  represents  a  reasonable  number  of  hours \nafter reducing  the  hours  claimed  that  are  considered  duplicative and \nredundant.  This  reduction shall be  apportioned between  the  three \nattorneys  as  follows: \nNo.  of Hours  No.  of  Hours  Determined \nClaimed  Type  B  to  be  Reasonable \nGilbert  42.0  33.0 \nStanley  34.0  25.0 \nCummings  26.5  17.5 \n102.5 hours  75.5  hours \nType  C activity  involved  drafting  of  pleadings  and  letters, \nresearch,  reading transcripts,  and  general  trial preparation.

Stanley  114 hours,  and  Cummings  23.5  hours  for Type  C \nactivity for  a  total  of 156  hours.  The  defendant  recommended  a  total of \n62  hours  objecting  on  the  grounds  that hours  claimed  were  excessive. \nduplicative,  and  undocumented.  The  Court  does  not  find  that number  of \nhours  claimed  by  the  plaintiffs  for  Type  C activity  to  be  unreasonable. \nType  D activity included  hearings  and  actual  in-court  time  for \ntrial of  the  litigation.  Plaintiffs'  counsel  respectively  claimed  the \nfollowing  number  of  hours  for  Type  D activity - Gilbert 48  hours; \nStanley 52  hours;  and  Cummings  50  hours  for a  total  of 150  hours.  The \ndefendant  recommended  reducing  the  number  of hours  claimed  for  Type  D \nactivity  to 94  hours  contending  that  some  of  the  hearings  local  counsel \ncould  have  handled  and  that  representation by  three  lawyers  at trial was \none  too many.  Defendant  recommended  deletion of the  hours  claimed  for \nthe  prison  tour due  to  a  discrepancy  in the  dates  in  the  fee  application. \nThe  trial in this  action  started on June  3.  1980,  and  continued \nthrough  June  6,  1980.  The  trial recessed  until  December  8,  1980.  and \nthen  continued  through  December  11,  1980,  for a  total  of eight days  of \ntrial.  Assuming  six hours  for  each day  of  trial a  total  of  forty-eight \n(48)  hours was  expended  for  each  attorney for an  aggregate  of  144  hours. \nThe  other hours  claimed  under  Type  D relate to motion  hearings,  deposi \ntions.  and  the  prison  tour.  Attendance  of  three attorneys  at the  pretrial \nhearing held  on  May  22,  1979,  was  unnecessary  and  resulted  in duplication \nof work  effort.  particularly  since  the  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction \nwas  not  being  pursued at that  time.  This  task  could  and  should  have \nreasonably  been  handled  by  one  lawyer  so  the  hours  claimed  for this \nhearing will be  reduced  by  twenty  (20)  hours.  The  Court  rejects  the \ndefendant's  recommendation  that  the  hours  claimed  for  the  prison tour \nbe  deleted.  The  Court  does.  however,  agree with the defendant's \ncontention that three  lawyers  to handle.  a  court  trial of  this nature \n(126  hours)  was  excessive  and  resulted  in unnecessary  duplication  of \neffort  so  the  number  of  hours  claimed  for  in-court time  will be  reduced \nby  forty-two  (42.0)  hours.  The  addition of a  second  chair for  trial \ninvites careful  scrutiny by  the  Court  for  p08sible  duplication  of effort. \n- 20  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 21 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nHinkle  v.

The \ndefendant  refused  to  participate  in the  proposed  mediation process. \nAttorney Gilbert claimed  four  and  one-half  (4.5)  hours  for his visit \nwith Jay Kaplan  and  one  hour for a  telephone  conversation.  The  defen \ndant  contended  that  these  hours  should  not be  compensated  since  they \nwere  not  incurred  with his  approval,  encouragement  or knowledge.  The \nCourt  rejects  the defendant's  argument  but  regards  the  plaintiffs' \nattempt  to  obtain mediation  of  the  dispute  as  ancillary  to  the  civil \nrights  litigation upon  which  an  award  of attorneys'  fees  can  be  based. \nThis  ancillary activity lies outside  the  context  of  the  civil rights \naction  filed  with the  district court  and  as  such  is not  compensable \nunder  42  U.S.C.  section 1988.  The  awarding  of  attorneys'  fees  for  other \nrelated proceedings  rests  in the  sound  discret.ion  of  the  trial court. \nBrown  v.  Bathke,  588  F.2d  634,  638  (8th Cir.1978).

The  Court  is unwilling  to  conclude  that all the  trips \nto  Sioux  Falls were  unnecessary  nor  is  it willing to compensate  this time \non  the  basis  of  costs  alone  as  recommended  by  the  defendant.  The  Court \ndoes,  however,  find  that  in the  exercise  of billing  judgment  counsel \nwould  not  bill a  private client for  80.0  hours  of travel  time,  particu \nlarly at the  same  rate  as  for  other  legal tasks.  The  Court  further finds \nthat  a  reasonable  number  of hours  would  be  60  hours  for  Type  F  activity. \nThis  reduction  shall be  apportioned  equally between Gilbert and  Stanley. \nType  G activity involved  the  time  expended  by  plaintiffs'  counsel \npreparing their fee  request.  Stanley  is the  only  attorney submitting \ntime  for  Type  G activity.  Stanley claims 4.0 hours  for  this activity. \nDefendant  recommended  that none  of  these  hours  should  be  compensated. \nCounsel  for  prevailing plaintiffs are  entitled  to  compensation for  time \nreasonably  spent  in preparing  and  establishing attorney  fees  pursuant to \n42  U.S.C.  section 1988.

The  Court  finds  that  the  four  (4.0)  hours  claimed  by  Stanley \nwere  reasonably  expended. \nIn  summary  the  Court  finds  that 461.52  hours  represents  a  reasonable \nnumber  of hours  for  the  litigation of this  case  which  hours  are  appor \ntioned  among  the  three  attorneys  in the  following  manner: \n- 22  -\n\n:. ... ~,  Case 4:79-c~v~c-·0r;4·J0\"\"6(.4•z: \" ' ? ~ ·D : \";fo\"\"~\\..c T ;i/uj$\"'m~w\"'>C eC.7nC,..;-t, CC ,.6, ~~1' ~  > , · F~il~e~d~ 0>3C/C0,8, ;~/.,2'~  00 ..1 ~>.  •    P age 23 of 35(cid:10)\n:  '¥\" , \nNo.  of Hours \nGilbert  125.84 \nStanley  228.84 \nCummings  106.84 \n461.52  hours \nThe  other half of  the  lodestar equation  for  computing  the  amount  of \na  reasonable  attorney fee  is a  reasonable  hourly  rate.

A lawyer's  customary  rate may,  however,  be  relevant  to \nthe  determination  of a  reasonable  hourly  rate but would  not be  conclu \nsive.  Ramos  v.  Lamm,  713  F.2d  546,  555  (lOth  Cir.  1983). \nPlaintiffs'  counsel  contended  that the  following  rates  represent \nreasonable  hourly  rates: \nGilbert  $125.00  per hour \nStanley  $125.00  per hour \nCummings  $  40.00  in-court per  hour \n$  30.00  out-of-court  per hour \nGilbert  in his  affidavit claimed  that  a  rate  of $125.00  per hour was \njustified by  his  experience  as  a  trial lawyer  in complex  litigation. \nStanley  in his affidavit claimed  that  his  experience,  particularly  in \nprison  litigation  justified a  rate  of  $125.00  per  hour.  The  rates \nclaimed  by  Gilbert and  Stanley  are  not  differentiated between  in-court \nand  out-of-court time.  Cummings  claimed  a  rate  of $40.00  for  in-court \ntime  and  $30.00  for  out-of-court  time  citing that this  case was  his \nfirst  federal  court case  and  civil rights  case.  Gilbert and  Stanley \nmade  no  attempt  to  establish that a  rate  of  $125.00  would  be  the \nordinary  rate  charged  by  lawyers  of  like  skill in Sioux  Falls,  South \nDakota,  for  similar work.  Gilbert  and  Stanley  instead  relied  on  what \nmight  be  their customary  charge  or the  ordinary  rate  for  such  services \nin Cleveland,  Ohio.  Counsel's  customary  charges  are  not  binding  upon \nthis  court.  Avalon  Cinema  Corp.  v.  Thompson,  supra.  The  definition  of \n\"reasonable  hourly  rate\"  established by  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of \nAppeals  requires  that  the  rate be  based  upon  the  ordinary  rate  for  the \narea  in which  the  case  is tried,  not  the  origin of plaintiffs'  counsel. \n1£.; \nJorstad v.  I.D.S.  Realty  Trust,  supra  at 1313.  In Jorstad v. \nI.D.S.  Realty Trust,  supra,  the  plaintiff requested  compensation  based \nupon  $125.00  per hour  for  senior attorneys  and  $60.00  for \nassociat~s \nand  the district court awarded  attorneys'  fees  based  upon  these  rates \nrelying upon  national  standards.

Avalon  Cinema  Corp.  v.  Thompson,  supra  (citing Donald \nson v.  O'Conner,  454  F.Supp.  311.  315  (N.D.Fla.  1978).  The  plaintiffs \nhere  have  failed  to  show  any  efforts to  obtain  local  counsel  so  will be \nheld  to  the  customary  fee  for  the  area  in whioh  the  trial was  held. \nThis  was  not  the  kind  of case  that members  of  the  South  Dakota  and  Sioux \n. Falls  bar would  have  been unable  or unwilling  to undertake. \nIn lieu  of granting  interest or increasing the  amount  for  inflation \nthe  prevailing  rate  for 1983  will be  applied  to  all the  hours  olaimed \ninstead  of a  historical rate.  The  Tenth  Circuit  in Ramos  v.  Lamm,  supra \nat 555.  stated that  n(t)he  hourly rate  at whioh  compensation  is awarded \nshould  reflect  rates  in effect at the  time  the  fee  is being  established \nby  the  court.  rather than  those  in effect at the  time  the  servioes were \nperformed.\"  This  approach  roughly  approximates  periodic  adjustments  for \ninflation and  interest.  Id. \nThe  Court  finds  that a  reasonable  hourly  rate  for  the  servioes \nperformed  by  Gilbert and  Stanley in this litigation,  based  upon  the \nprevailing  rate  in Sioux  Falls,  South Dakota.  for  lawyers  of  like  skill \nand  competence  performing  similar services,  is $75.00  per hour  for  in \ncourt time  and  $60.00  per  hour  for  out-of-oourt  time.  The  Court  acoepts \nCummings'  claimed  rate  of $40.00  for  in-court and  $30.00  for  out-of \noourt  time. \nMultiplying  these  reasonable  hourly  rates  by  the  reasonable  number \nof hours  previously determined  yields  the  following  lodestar for  each  of \nthe  attorneys: \nIn-Court  Hourly  Rate  Lodestar \nfiours \nGilbert  33.34  $75.00  $2,500.50 \nStanley  37.34  75.00  2.800.50 \nCummings  35.34  40.00  1,413.60 \n106.02  hours  $6,714.60 \n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Pag. ,e'\"  2::-6- of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nOut-of-Court  Hourly Rate  Lodestar \n-Hours \nGilbert  92.5  $60.00  $  5,550.00 \nStanley  191.5  60.00  11.490.00 \nCummings  71.5  30.00  2,145.00 \n355.5  hours  $19.185.00 \nTOTAL  $25.899.60 \nThe  above  analysis  also  applies  to  computing  the  lodestar or base \nfee  for  the  efforts  of Kemp,  the  paralegal  employed  by  Cummings  to \nassist in this  litigation.  The  application for  fees  submitted  by \nCummings  includes 409.5 hours  of effort expended  by  Kemp.  These  hours \nare  divided  between  compilation  of  statistics  (185  hours)  and  all other \nhours  (224.5  hours).  A rate of $15.00  per hour was  multiplied  times \nthe  409.5  hours  to  arrive at a  proposed  lodestar of $6.142.50.  The \ndefendant  recommended  a  total  of 9.5 hours  times  a  rate of $5.00  per \nhour  for  a  lodestar of $47.50.  The  defendant  argued  that Kemp's  claimed \nhours  were  excessive,  undocumented,  unnecessary,  pro  bono,  and  educa \ntional. \nThe  Court  agrees with  the  defendant  that the  number  of  hours \nexpended  by  Kemp  were  excessive  given  the  scope,  nature,  and  complexity \nof  this case,  particularly as  it relates  to  sessions  with plaintiffs \nand  other unspecified  witnesses  and  Kemp's  limited  role  in the  litiga \ntion.  In addition,  it appears  that Kemp  also  spent an  unnecessary \namount  of  time  on  legal  research not  relevant  to the  case.  The  Court \nis  not  at this point addressing  itself to  the  lack  of documentation \npresent  in Kemp's  application,  but  will  address  this problem  later. \nThe  Court  finds  230  hours  to  be  a  reasonable number  of hours  for  the \ntasks  performed  by  Kemp.  The  proposed  rate  of  $15.00  per hour  is also \ntoo  high  for  similar services  in the  area.  The  Court  finds  that .a \nreasonable  hourly  rate  is $10.00  per hour.  The  lodestar for Kemp's \nservices  is $2.300.00  (230  hours  x  $10.00  per hour). \nThe  establishment of a  lodestar or  base  fee  does  not  end  the \nCourt's  inqUiry  in determining  a  reasonable  fee.

In addition,  the  twelve  Johnson v. \nGeorgia Highway  Express,  Inc.,  488  F.2d  714  (5th Cir.  1974),  factors \nalso  provide  guidelines  to  be  used  by  a  court  to  enhance  the  lodestar. \nPlaintiffs suggested  in  their fee  applications  (Gilbert and  stanley)' \nthat a  multiplier or bonus  factor  should  be  applied  to  the  lodestar for \nthe  quality,  risk,  complexity,  and  because  work  on  this  case  precluded \nwork  for  other clients.  The  defendant,  on  the  other hand,  argued  that \nenhancement  was  not  justified  in this case.  A moving  party bears  a \nheavy burden  in establishing  entitlement to  an  increase  in the  lodestar \nfor  risk and  quality.  Jorstad  v.  I.D.S.  Realty  Trust,  supra  at 1314. \nIncreasing  of  the  lodestar to  adjust for  the  quality  of counsel's work \nis designed  to  reward  an  unusual  or extraordinary degree  of  skill.  The \nCourt  finds  that under  the  circumstances  in this case  that enhancement \nof  the  lodestar  is not  justified.  Although  counsel  for  the  plaintiffs' \npurported  to have  exhibited  extraordinary  skill in handling  this case, \nthe  level  of  skill shown  has  been compensated  in the  \"reasonable  hourly \nrate\"  established by  the  Court.  This  case  was  not  so  complex  and  unusual \nthat  it required  special  skills to  litigate the  questions  involved.  The \nrisk  or contingency  involved  in this  case  was  also  not  out  of the \nordinary  so  as  to  justify an  enhancement  of  the  lodestar. \nIf a  plaintiff in a  civil rights  case  does  not  prevail  on  all claims \nunrelated  to  those  upon  which  he  succeeds.  they  are  not  entitled to  compen \nsation  for  time  expended  on  these  unrelated  unsuccessful  claims.

The  results  or  success  obtained was  cited by  the Supreme  Court \nin Hensley  as  an  important  factor  to be  considered  by  the  district court \nin determining  a  reasonable  fee.

Hensley \nemphasized  that  the  relationship between  the  extent  of  success  and  the \namount  of fee  award  may  justify an  adjustment  of the  lodestar.  Hensley \nv.  Eckerhart,  supra,  U.S.  at _____ ,  103  S.Ct.  1940,  76  L.Ed.2d  at \n51.  Hensley  also  established  that  a  plaintiff may  be  compensated  for \ntime  expended  on  unsuccessful  claims  that are  related  to  the successful \nclaims.  Id.  The  emphasis  that may  be  placed  on  the  degree  of  success \nunder Hensley  exceeded  that previously authorized  in the  Eighth  Circuit. \n§!! Brown  v.  Bathke,  supra. \nPlaintiffs asserted  that  their complaint  presented  interrelated \nlegal  theories which  precluded an  adjustment  based  upon  the  success \nobtained pursuant to Hensl~.  The  plaintiffs essentially urged  that \nall the  claims made  were  \"related\"  hence  under  Hensley  they  may  be \ncompensated  for all their time  although  unsuccessful  on  some  of  their \nclaims.  The  defendant,  however,  argued  that the  principles enunciated \nin Hensley  demanded  a  large reduction  in the  lodestar. \nHensley  requires  an  initial determination  as  to whether  the  plain \ntiffs failed  to  prevail  on  claims  unrelated  to  the  successful  claims. \nThe  plaintiffs presented  three  major  theories  of  relief to  the  Court  in \nthis litigation.  These  theories  were  (1)  conditions  of confinement  in \nthe  Adjustment  Center violated  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments; \n(2)  procedures  governing  placement  and  continued  detention  in the \n- 28  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-0406•4      Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001•     P age 29 of 35(cid:10) ,-\" . -' ',-~' \nAdjustment  Center and  the  ceu  violated  Fifth and  Fourteenth Amendment \ndue  process;  and  (3)  racial discrimination in the  placement  and  continued \nconfinement  in the  Adjustment  Center.  The  plaintiffs asserted  that these \nthree  claims  are  related  claims  and  not  severable from  each  other. \nThe  three  theories  of  relief set forth  by  the  plaintiffs were  not \nbased  upon  a  common  core  of facts,  nor  were  they  related  legal  theories \nin the  sense  of warranty  and  tort claims  in products  liability cases. \nId.  The  theories  presented were  not  alternate  theories  to  but  one  end \nbut  instead would  each achieve  a  different  type  of  relief.  The  liti \ngation can  theoretically be  viewed  as  a  series  of discrete  claims.  Id. \nThe  plaintiffs,  however,  by  the  nature  of  their fee  application \neffectively precluded  analysis  of  the  time  expended  on  each  of these \ndiscrete  claims. \nThe  plaintiffs did  not  prevail  to  any  extent  on  their racial \ndiscrimination claim and  obtained  only  limited  success  on  their other \nclaims.  No  Eighth Amendment  violations were  found  in the  overall \nconditions  in the  Adjustment  Center and  only minor  problems  were  found \nwith  respect  to  individual  living conditions  in the  Adjustment  Center. \nThe  problems  identified for the  most  part were  not  problems  of consti \ntutional  proportion.  The  plaintiffs also did  not  completely  succeed  on \nall their due  process  allegations,  but were  only  moderately  successful. \nThe  plaintiffs'  fee  application did  not  differentiate,  with  some \nexceptions,  between  legal  theories  in terms  of documenting  the  time \nexpended.  This  forces  the  Court  to  view  the  plaintiffs'  application \nas  a  single  interrelated  claim and  not  as  discrete  claims.  The  Supreme \nCourt  in Hensley  directed  that  in  those  instances where  counsel's  time \nis devoted  to  the  litigation as  a  whole  making  it difficult to divide \nthe  hours  expended  on  a  claim-by-claim basis  the  court  \"should  focus  on \nthe  significance  of  the  overall  relief  obtained  •  •  •  in relation  to  the \nhours  reasonably  expended  on  the  litigation.\"  Id.  The  Supreme  Court \nfurther  stated  that  \"(w)here  a  plaintiff has  obtained  excellent results, \nhis  attorney  should  recover  a  fully  compensatory  fee.\"  Id.

Id.  The  Court  does \nnot  find  the  results  achieved  in this  litigation to be  so  excellent to \njustify ignoring  the  degree  of  success  as  a  faotor  in determining  a \nreasonable  fee. \n\"If the  plaintiff has  achieved  'only partial or limited  success' \nthen  even  though  the  plaintiff's claims  were  'interrelated,  nonfrivolous, \nand  raised  in good  faith,'  an  award  determined  by  multiplying  the  hours \nreasonably  expended  on  the  whole  litigation by  a  reasonable  hourly  rate \nmay  be  excessive:  'Again,  the  most  critical factor  is  the  degree  of \nsuocess  obtained.'\"  Ramos  v.

The  application of  these  principles  the  Supreme \nCourt  stated was  \"particularly important  in complex  civil rights  liti' \ngation  involving numerous  challenges  to  institutional practices  or \nconditions.\"  Hensley v.  Eckerhart,  supra,  U.S.  at  •  103  S.Ct. \nat 1941,  76  L.Ed.2d  at 52. \nThe  Court  finds  that upon  viewing  the  results  obtained  by  the \nplaintiffs  in this  litigation,  and  the  number  of hours  expended  that \nthe  lodestar,  previously  determined,  is excessive  given the  degree  of \nsuccess  obtained.  The  Supreme  Court  in Hensley  stated  that district \ncourts  are  vested with discretion  in making  an  equitable  judgment \nconcerning  this question.  Id.  The  trial court  may  in  its discretion \n\"attempt  to  identify specific  hours  that should  be  eliminated  or it may \nsimply  reduce  the  award  to  account  for  the  limited  success.\"  Id.  The \nnature  of the  plaintiffs'  application  effectively deprived  the  Court  of \nthe  first option of  eliminating  specific  hours  so  the  second  method  will \nbe  applied. \nAt  the  outset  of  this case  the  plaintiffs  sought  extensive  changes \nin  the  conditions  and  operation  of  the  Adjustment  Center,  but  the  results \nobtained,  although  significant,  were  limited  in nature  and  fell  far  short \nof  the  original goal.  The  Court  finds  that  the  principles stated  in \nHensleY  are  particularly appropriate  here  and  thereby  reduces  the \n- 30  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 31 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nlodestar of $28,199.60  by  a  multiplier of  .40 which  reduces  the  lodestar \nto $16.919.76.  See  generally  Institutionalized Juveniles  v.  Secretary of \nPublic Welfare.  568  F.Supp.  1020  (E.D.Pa.  1983)  (applied  Hensley and \nreduced  the lodestar by  a  factor  of  .50 for  lack of  success). \nIII.  Adjustment  to  the  Lodestar  for  Lack  of Documentation  and  Specificity \nAn  applicant for  attorney's  fees  bears  the  burden  of establishing \nboth his  entitlement to  an  award  and  documenting  the  hours  expended  and \nthe  hourly rates.  Hensley  v.  Eckerhart,  supra.  U.S.  at  ,  103 \nS.ct.  at 1941,  76  L.Ed.2d  at 53.  Hensley  stated  that  fee  applicants \nshould maintain billing time  records  in a  manner  that will allow the \nreviewing  court  to  identify  time  spent  on  distinct claims  at least to \nthe  extent  of  identifying the  general  subject matter  of  the  time \n1£. \nexpenditures.  U.S.  at  •  103 S.Ct.  at 1941,  f.n.  12, . \n76  L.Ed.2d  at 53,  f.n.  12.  \"Where  the  documentation  of  hours  is inade \nquate,  the district court may  reduce  the  award  accordingly.\"  Id. \nSO. \nU.S.  at  ,  103 S.Ct.  at 1939.  76  L.Ed.2d at \nPlaintiffs  in their fee  applications  submitted  affidavits  reflecting \nthe  amount  of  time  expended  and  provided very generalized  and  vague \nstatements  in most  instances  as  to  specific nature  of  the work  performed, \ni.e ••  time  expended  on  the  various  claims.  The  applications appeared  to \nbe  a  reconstruction  of  the  time  expended  rather than based  on  contempo \nraneous  time  records  and  as  such were  merely  estimates  of  the  time \nexpended.  The  plaintiffs'  counsel  in particular did  not document  the \nspecific nature  of  the  many  hours  of  meetings  with witnesses.  plain \ntiffs.  and  meetings  among  themselves •. The  documentation  supplied  by \nKemp  to  justify his  expenditure  of  time  was  especially deficient.  In \nsome  instances  the  date  such  time  was  expended  was  not  provided.  In \naddition,  no  specific evidence was  provided  as  to  the  reasonableness  of \nthe  rate  sought  under  the  appropriate  standard.  The  information  supplied \nby  the  plaintiffs made  it very difficult  if not  impossible  for  the  Court \nto adequately  reView  the  reasonableness  of  the  hours  and  apply  the \nprinciples  of Hensley v.  Eckerhart. \n- 31  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001     Page 32 of 35(cid:10)\n•  • \nThe  Eighth Circuit has  stated that lawyers  claiming  statutory fe. \nawards  must  insure  that all the  necessary  information  is presented  to the \ncourt.  i.e., detailed  affidavits  explaining and  itemizing  their fee \nclaims.  See  Gruin v.  International House  of  Pancakes,  513  F.2d  114,  127 \n(8th Cir.).  cert.  denied  423  U.S.  864.  96  S.Ct.  124.  46  L.Ed.2d  93 \n(1975);  Jorstad v.  I.D.S.  Realty  Trust,  supra  at 1313.  other circuits, \nhowever,  have  been  much  more  explicit  in defining  the  type  of documenta \ntion preferred  or required.  In  New  York  Ass'n  for  Retarded  Children v. \nCarey,  711  F.2d  1136  (2nd  Cir.  1983),  the  court  stated,  in light of  the \nproblems  they had  experienced  with undocumented  and  underdocumented  fee \nrequests,  that \n(h) ereafter ,  any  attorney - whether a  private  prac \ntitioner or an  employee  of a  nonprofit  law  office who \napplies for  court-ordered compensation  in the  circuit \nfor work  done  after the  date  of this  opinion  must \ndocument  the  application with  contemporaneous  time \nrecords.  These  records  should  specify for  each \nattorney,  the  date,  the  hours  expended,  and  the \nnature  of  the  work  done. \nId.  at 1148;  See also McCann  v.  Coughlin,  698  F.2d  112  (2nd  Cir.  1983) \n(expressed  a  preference  for  contemporaneous  time  records).  The  absence \nof  these  kinds  of records  deprives  the  court of a  basis  for  evaluating \nthe  reasonableness  of the  requested  fees  in terms  of efficiency,  staffing, \nand  duplication of effort.  In  addition,  as  in this case,  where  an \nadjustment  in  the  fee  petition  is warranted  to  reflect  the  plaintiffs' \ndegree  of  success  under Hensley,  the  court  is also deprived  of an \neffective means  of making  this apportionment.  McCann  v.  Coughlin, \nsupra  at 131.  In Nadeau  v.  Helgemoe,  supra  at 279,  the  court  held  that \n\"(a)s  for the  future,  we  will  not view  with sympathy  any  claim that a \ndistrict court abused  its discretion  in  awarding  unreasonably  low \nattorney's  fees  in a  suit in which  plaintiffs were  only  partially \nsuccessful  if counsel's  records  do  not  provide a  proper basis for \ndetermining  how  much  time  was  spent  on  particular  claims.\" \nThe  Court  of Appeals  for the  District of Columbia  recently  set out \nin great detail the  obligations  of an  applicant for  attorneys'  fees with \n\n•• \nCase 4:79-cv-04064     Document 61     Filed 03/08/2001  •   Pa ge 33 of 35(cid:10)\n• \nrespect  to  documentation  and  the  procedures  to be  followed  by  the \ndistrict courts  in evaluating the applications.  National  Ass'n of \nConcerned Vets  v.  Secretary  of Defense.  675  F.2d 1319  (D.C.  Cir.  1982). \nAttorneys  seeking  statutory awards  of attorney fees  would  be  well-advised \nto  consult  this  opinion  as a  guide. \nThe  plaintiffs' .a  pplioation for  attorneys' . tees  in terms  of docu \nmentation  presented  the Court  with  problems.  The  plaintiffs \nn~erous \nfailed  to  provide  adequate  documentation  of  the  specific  nature  of  the \nwork  performed  in many  of  its out-of-court hours •. The  Court  in \nevaluating the  reasonableness  of the  hours  claimed  did  not  address \nitself to  the  problem  of documentation  and  speQifioity and  made  no \nreduotions  in the number  of hours  on  that basis.  Although  the  Court \nhesitates to  reduce  the lodestar further due  to the  laek  of documenta \ntion.  suoh  a  reduotion  is demanded  by  the glaring defioiencies  in the \nplaintiffs'  fee  application.  The  Court  hereby  reduces  the  lodestar of \n$16,919.76 by  a  faetor  of  .10  reducing  the  lodestar to $15,227.78. \nIV.  Summary \nThe  Court  found  that  plaintiffs were  a  prevailing  party  pursuant \nto 42  U.S.C.  section 1988  and  as  such were  entitled  to  an  award  of \nreasonable  attorneys'  fees.  The  Court  found  that a  reasonable  number \nof hours  for  this  litigation was  691.52  hours  reflecting a  reduction of \n304.48  hours  from  the  plaintiffs'  claim of 996  hours.  These  reductions \nwere  primarily  based  upon  duplication of effort and  excessiveness  of the \nnumber  of hours  claimed.  The  Court  found  that a  reasonable  rate  for  the \nservices  of  plaintiffs'  counsel to  be  in  the  oase  of Gilbert and  Stanley \n$75.00  per hour  for  in-court time  and  $60.00  per hour  for out-of-court \ntime.  The  Court accepted  Cummings'  claimed  rate  of $40.00  and  $30.00 \nper hour for  in-court and  time  respectively.  The  Court \nout-of~court \napplied  a  rate of $10.00  per hour  to Kemp's  claim.  The  following \nrefleots  the  lodestar oomputation  for  plaintiffs'  counsel: \n- 33  -\n\nCase 4:79-cv-04064•     D ocument 61     Filed 03/08/2001  •   Pa ge 34 of 3\";5~ (cid:10) • \"~.\"~, ••, -\" •• ,  • -;r  \"• • \n• \nTotal  Lodestar \nGilbert  $  8,050.50 \nStanley  14,290.50 \nCummings  3.558.60 \nKemp  2,300.00 \n$28,199.60 \nThe  Court  rejected  plaintiffs'  claim for enhancement  of  the \nlodestar finding  that enhancement was  not  appropriate  under  the \ncircumstances.  The  Court  found  upon  applying  the  mandate  in Hensley \nv.  Eckerhart  that the  relationship between  the  results  of  litigation \nand  the  lodestar of $28,199.60  that the  lodestar should  be  reduced \nby  a  factor  of  .40  to $16,919.76.  The  lodestar was  further  reduced \nby  a  factor  of  .10  for  lack  of documentation  and  specificity to an \nadjusted  lodestar of $15,227.78.  Cummings  also applied  for  an  award \nof $1,008.90  for costs,  which  request was  not  objected  to by  the \ndefendant. \nThe  Court  based  upon  the  preceding  analysis hereby  orders \nthat  judgment  should  be  entered  for  the  plaintiffs in the  amount \nof $15,227.78  for attorneys'  fees  pursuant  to 42  U.S.C.  section \n2 \n1988  and  costs  of $1,008.90.
